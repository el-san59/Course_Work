Viral yields for strains of CCHF virus from Europe, Asia, and Africa in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells were markedly reduced by this drug. Some CCHF viral strains appeared more sensitive than others, but in general, ribavirin doses as low as 5 micrograms/ml caused a transient reduction of viral yields. A further reduction in viral yields was induced by a dose of 25 micrograms/ml, and evidence of viral replication was not demonstrated in cells treated with 50 or 250 micrograms/ml. In contrast, a dose of ribavirin at least 9 times greater was required to induce a comparable inhibitory effect on the yields of Rift Valley fever virus, for which the drug has been shown to inhibit replication in monkeys and rodents.\r"

In the study, 1,451 patients with infection risk factors who underwent gastroduodenal or biliary surgery were included, of whom 722 received cefotaxime and 729 cefoxitin. The characteristics of both groups were comparable. The frequency of wound infections in the cefotaxime group was 3.3 percent and in the cefoxitin group, 7.6 percent. The difference was statistically significant. The lowest rate of wound infection (0.63 percent) was achieved when cefotaxime was administered during the last hour before surgery. In both groups, the frequency of infections was directly related to the duration of operation. Hospital stay was, on average, 3 days longer in patients with wound infections. After cost-benefit analysis, we have concluded that cefotaxime treatment results in substantial reduction of costs derived from antibiotic prophylaxis.\r"

  ".U": "90054514\r", 
  ".W": "One of the most important problems during cardiac surgery is the prevention and treatment of hypertension, occurring in 40-60% of the patients following coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS). Hypertension should be avoided to prevent myocardial damage, neurologic complications, increased blood loss, and premature graft closure due to intimal damage. During and following cardiac surgery hypertension is routinely treated with vasodilating agents, which generally induce reflex tachycardia and increased intrapulmonary shunting. The results obtained with ketanserin, a specific S2-serotonergic receptor blocker with alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blocking properties, in the prevention and treatment of hypertension in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, are presented. Ketanserin effectively lowers blood pressure by decreasing systemic vascular resistance but does not completely prevent perioperative and postoperative hypertension when administered as a continuous infusion from the start of anesthesia. In contrast to sodium nitroprusside, ketanserin does not induce reflex tachycardia in the treatment of postoperative systemic hypertension following CABS. The compound improves diuresis and perfusion of the skin perioperatively. Ketanserin is devoid of rebound phenomena after its administration is stopped. It is postulated that the antihypertensive effect of ketanserin can be explained by its property of simultaneously blocking alpha 1-adrenergic and S2-serotonergic receptors.\r"

A similar study of 12 asthmatics (nine from the UNDW trial) was performed using cold-air hyperventilation challenge (CAHC). In vitro analyses were also made of samples from ten mild asthmatics to determine the effect of terfenadine on basophil histamine release. Terfenadine, 240 mg, showed significant (P = .012) benefit over placebo in improving pulmonary function after UNDW challenge. Modest but significant (P less than .05) bronchodilator benefits were also demonstrated by terfenadine, 240 and 120 mg, after CAHC. Finally, the in vitro study showed significant inhibition by terfenadine of anti-IgE-induced histamine release from human basophils.\r"

In placebo-controlled trials, topically applied azatadine base, a tricyclic antihistamine with in vitro antirelease action, effectively reduced symptoms and mediator levels in nasal lavage fluids after antigen challenge, suggesting mast cell inhibition. Both terfenadine and cetirizine, systemically administered antihistamines, were clinically effective in reducing sneezing and changes in vascular permeability. Only terfenadine significantly reduced histamine in antigen-induced nasal secretions. However, cetirizine did reduce the level of leukotriene C4 in these fluids. These results indicate that some antihistamines may be capable of suppressing mediator release from nasal mast cells. The significance of this property in those compounds' overall clinical effect is unclear because of their other concomitant activities.\r"

Because marked inequality of ventilation/perfusion ratios in critically ill patients might affect this correlation, we assessed changes of PETCO2 in predicting changes in PaCO2 (delta PaCO2) and changes in minute ventilation (delta Ve) in this patient population. Twenty consecutive intubated patients 38 to 89 yr of age (mean, 70 yr) with respiratory failure while receiving MVS with indwelling arterial lines were studied. Settings on the mechanical ventilator were varied for frequency and tidal volume, and after a minimum of 5 to 10 min equilibration, PaCO2 and PETCO2 were measured. Vt and Ve were recorded from the digital indicator of the pneumotachygraph within the mechanical ventilator and corrected for compression volume in the respirator circuit. A total of 116 simultaneous measurements were performed. PETCO2 correlated well with PaCO2 (r = 0.78, p less than 0.001). The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in PaCO2-PETCO2 was 4.0 +/- 0.97 mm Hg. However, delta PETCO2 (measured from baseline) did not correlate as well with delta PaCO2 (r = 0.58, p = less than 0.001). In four patients, the trend in their PETCO2 during changes in mechanical ventilation were in the opposite direction from the trend in their PaCO2. Thus, many critically ill patients, who cannto be preidentified, have an inconstant PaCO2-PETCO2 gradient with changes of ventilation. Utilization of PETCO2 as a noninvasive monitoring substitute for trends in PaCO2 in critically ill patients may be misleading despite establishing an initial PaCO2-PETCO2 relationship.\r"

  ".W": "Incubation of eosinophils (EOS) with alveolar macrophage (AM) supernatants isolated from asthmatic subjects followed by stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187 resulted in enhancement of the capacity of EOS to elaborate leukotriene C4 (LTC4) (mean enhancement 169 +/- 37%, n = 31). Pretreatment of EOS with AM supernatants derived from normal individuals did not enhance LTC4 generation as compared with control medium. Enhancement was maximal when EOS were preincubated with a 1:6 dilution of AM supernatants for 5 min at 37 degrees C and were then stimulated with 5 microM A23187 for 15 min. Separation of AM supernatants by size-exclusion HPLC using a TSK G3000 SW column resulted in a peak of enhancing activity with an estimated molecular mass of approximately 30,000 D. Further purification by anion exchange HPLC using a TSK DEAE 5PW column (pH 7.4) resolved the activity into a minor peak at 0.17 M NaCl and a major peak at 0.2 M NaCl. The activities were distinct from interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor. Resolution of the major peak of activity by reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 spherisorb ODS column and a slope gradient of 0 to 100% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid demonstrated a single peak of activity that eluted at 41% acetonitrile. The enhancing activity was sensitive to trypsin and heat and was neutralized by a specific antibody to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Pretreatment of EOS with recombinant GM-CSF primed the cells for enhanced LTC4 generation following subsequent stimulation with A23187. GM-CSF may play a role in the amplification of the eosinophilic inflammation in asthmatic airways.\r"

Respiratory muscle strength was indicated by maximal static inspiratory and expiratory pressures. Inspiratory muscle endurance was determined by the product of pressure load and the sustained time, i.e., pressure-time index, while the subject breathed against an inspiratory pressure load on a modified Nickerson-Keens device. The results showed that the inspiratory muscle endurance was greater in the midluteal phase than in the follicular phase (815 +/- 43 versus 649 +/- 62 cmH2O.min, respectively), whereas the respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function were unchanged. We conclude that inspiratory muscle endurance is affected by the menstrual cycle, i.e., higher in the midluteal phase and lower in the midfollicular phase.\r"

In this report, the density of the entire lung microvasculature as measured by gray-scale analysis of scanning electron microscopic images of corrosion casts is reported. In the first experiment, monocrotaline, 60 mg/kg, was injected intraperitoneally into Sprague-Dawley rats. After 16 days, the pulmonary vascular tree was cast with methylmethacrylate. The vascular density index of the casts at a magnification x 100 on the alveolar surface was 0.40 for the monocrotaline-treated animals and 0.48 for the saline-treated control animals (p less than 0.01). On the pleural surface, it was 0.51 for the monocrotaline animals and 0.67 for the saline animals (p less than 0.001). A second experiment found no significant difference in vascular density index between different doses of monocrotaline. Light and scanning electron microscopy suggest that capillary and small vessel thrombosis may account for the decrease in the density of vessels in pulmonary microvascular casts that occurs in response to monocrotaline.\r"

Little is known, however, of the factor(s) initiating polyamine synthesis in pulmonary hypertension. This study tested the key aspects of the hypothesis that augmented polyamine synthesis, and attendent vascular structural alterations in monocrotaline (MCT)-treated rats can be ascribed to elaboration of an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like mitogen. In lungs of rats treated 4 days previously with 60 mg/kg, EGF-like immunoreactivity was detected diffusely throughout perivascular regions. Intravenous administration of human recombinant EGF (125 pg/h) to rats for 1 wk was associated with medial thickening in pulmonary arteries between 100 and 200 microns in diameter, significant increases in lung polyamine contents, and a moderate elevation in mean pulmonary arterial pressure. These observations indicate that EGF can be detected in the lungs of MCT-treated rats and that exogenous EGF mimics some of the action of MCT on the rat lung. It is thus reasonable to speculate that an EGF-like mitogen may participate in the response to MCT in part through a polyamine-dependent mechanism.\r"

Thirty-eight men (eight diabetic) and 12 women (two diabetic), with an average age of 62.4 (47 to 79) years comprised the GA group; 35 men (six diabetic) and 15 women (one diabetic), with an average age of 64.1 (51 to 74) years comprised the RA group. Twenty-one patients (17 men, 4 women) in the GA and 24 patients (19 men, 5 women) in the RA group had hypertension. Every patient had some stigmata of cardiac disease. Patients receiving GA for CEA spent an average of 1.2 days in the surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 6.1 days in a regular hospital bed, for an average cost of $4547. The patients who underwent CEA under RA had an average of 0.1 ICU days and 4.1 regular hospital days, for a cost of $2067. RA saved $2480 per patient and $124,000 in our study group, with no increase in mortality or morbidity rates (P less than 0.001).

  ".W": "To elucidate the possible association of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and chronic neurological diseases, 156 serum samples from patients with various neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, chronic progressive myelopathy, chronic inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, motor neuron disease, and tension headache, and healthy control subjects were examined for IgG antibodies to HTLV-I by three independent techniques--gelatin particle agglutination test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot assay. Specificity of antibodies was assessed by homologous competitive inhibition on Western blot assay. Six patients (3 with chronic progressive myelopathy, 1 with chronic inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy, 1 with motor neuron disease, and 1 with tension headache) had high-titer HTLV-I antibodies. Twelve patients (5 with multiple sclerosis, 1 with chronic progressive myelopathy, 2 with chronic inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy, 2 with myasthenia gravis, and 2 with motor neuron disease) had low-titer HTLV-I antibodies that reacted with a single gag protein, p19 or p24, on Western blot assay. In 4 (2 with multiple sclerosis, 1 with chronic progressive myelopathy, and 1 with chronic inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy) of these 12, the antibodies that were all directed to p19 were determined to be specific by homologous competitive inhibition. In the remaining 8 patients (3 with multiple sclerosis, 1 with chronic inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy, 2 with myasthenia gravis, and 2 with motor neuron disease), restricted reactions against p19 or p24 were considered to be nonspecific because they were not inhibited by homologous competitive inhibition. The results suggest that in some patients chronic myeloneuropathy diagnosed as chronic progressive multiple sclerosis, chronic progressive myelopathy, and chronic inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy may be associated with HTLV-I or related retroviruses.\r"

Essential to this hypothesis is the existence of deteriorating function in the nigrostriatal pathway with advancing age. The present study was undertaken with [18F]6-fluoro-L-dopa and positron emission tomography to determine in vivo the effects of age on the nigrostriatal pathway in a series of 10 asymptomatic subjects (age range, 22-80 years; mean, 49.8 years). A graphical approach was used in the analysis of multiple-time tracer-uptake data to establish the presence of a compartment with unidirectional uptake and to calculate the rate constant, K, for uptake of [18F]6-fluoro-L-dopa from blood to striatum during steady-state, an index of the functional integrity of nigrostriatal nerve endings. There was a significant linear relationship between K and age (r = 0.80, p less than 0.005) with a decrease of 53.3% over the age range studied. These results demonstrate the application of a unidirectional transfer model to the analysis of [18F]6-fluoro-L-dopa and positron emission tomography data and provide in vivo confirmation of an age-related impairment of nigrostriatal function.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-seven patients with neuropathy and IgM monoclonal gammopathy were tested for antigen specificity of the M-protein and for anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) IgM levels by immunoblot. In 16 patients (59.2%) the M-protein reacted with MAG and with cross-reactive glycoconjugates. Anti-MAG IgM titers in these patients ranged between 1:12,800 and 1:100,000. A fainter IgM reactivity with MAG and related glycoconjugates was detected in 3 additional patients with neuropathy, but also in 8 of 24 patients with IgM M-protein without neuropathy (33.3%). This reactivity was not due to the M-protein and corresponded to antibody titers of 1:400 or less in all but 1 patient with a titer of 1:3,200. Low titers of anti-MAG IgM (1:200 or less) were also detected in 17 of 101 control patients without IgM M-proteins (16.8%), while 1 patient with neuropathy of unknown cause had anti-MAG IgMK titers of 1:25,600. In 1 patient with neuropathy and IgM M-protein that was not anti-MAG, the M-protein bound to other antigens in nerve, while in 6, other possible causes or mechanisms for the neuropathy were found. In this study, high titers of anti-MAG IgM antibodies were always associated with neuropathy. The presence of low levels of anti-MAG IgM in a significant proportion of controls suggests that monoclonal expansion of naturally occurring B-cell clones secreting anti-MAG IgM may be responsible for the high incidence of this antigen specificity of the M-protein.\r"

We determined whether patterns of plasma levels of dopa, norepinephrine, dihydroxyphenylglycol, and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid would distinguish patients with orthostatic hypotension associated with multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, or deficiency of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. Plasma levels of catechols were normal in most patients with multiple system atrophy, consistent with relatively intact peripheral sympathetic neurons; in contrast, most patients with pure autonomic failure had decreased levels of all four catechols, consistent with degenerative loss of sympathetic nerve endings. Patients with deficiency of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase had increased levels of dopa and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and markedly decreased levels of norepinephrine and dihydroxyphenylglycol, suggesting compensatory increases in sympathetic nerve activity in the absence of norepinephrine biosynthesis. Subgroups of patients with pure autonomic failure or multiple system atrophy had low levels of norepinephrine with normal levels of dopa, dihydroxyphenylglycol, and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, consistent with normal catecholamine biosynthesis and decreased postganglionic sympathetic nerve traffic or decreased exocytotic release from sympathetic nerve endings.

BO-1341 was highly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC for 90% of the strains tested, 1.56 micrograms/ml), Pseudomonas maltophilia (MIC for 50% of the strains tested, 1.56 micrograms/ml), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (MIC for 90% of the strains tested, 3.13 micrograms/ml). Furthermore, BO-1341 was highly active against P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to the other antibiotics. Of 199 P. aeruginosa isolates tested, only 2 were resistant to BO-1341. These two strains were also resistant to ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and nonenteric streptococci were also susceptible to BO-1341, but Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis were not susceptible to the compound. The protective efficacy against experimental infections in mice caused by nine strains of gram-negative bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, reflected the potent in vitro activity.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the correlation between bacterial cell susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and the magnitude of uptake and cell target sensitivity, the relative contribution of ciprofloxacin accumulation in intact cells and its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis were investigated among strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Alcaligenes faecalis. Uptake studies of [14C]ciprofloxacin demonstrated diffusion kinetics for P. aeruginosa and E. coli. Ciprofloxacin was more readily removed from E. coli J53 and A. faecalis ATCC 19018 by washing than from P. aeruginosa PAO503. These results indicate that the process of cell accumulation is different for P. aeruginosa in that the drug is firmly bound at an extracellular site. Whatever the washing conditions, A. faecalis accumulated less drug than either of the other two bacteria. Magnesium chloride (10 mM) caused a substantial decrease of ciprofloxacin accumulated and an increase in the MIC, depending upon the nature of the medium. The addition of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone caused a variable increase in drug accumulated, depending on the medium and the bacterial strain. The concentration of ciprofloxacin required to obtain 50% inhibition (ID50) of DNA synthesis for P. aeruginosa PAO503 and A. faecalis ATCC 19018 did not correlate with their corresponding MICs but did for E. coli J53. Treatment with EDTA decreased the ID50 of ciprofloxacin for P. aeruginosa PAO503 and its gyrA derivative by 5- and 2-fold, respectively, and decreased the ID50 for E. coli JB5R, a strain with a known decrease in OmpF, by 1.4-fold but did not decrease the ID50 for the normally susceptible E. coli J53.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Gentamicin alone or combined with piperacillin was added to heat-inactivated human serum to approximate drug concentrations achieved after the above-mentioned types of infusion. By a microdilution technique, seven strains of P. aeruginosa were exposed to no drug (control) and gentamicin alone or with piperacillin; colony counts were determined at hourly intervals for 5 h, and log10 CFU per milliliter was plotted versus time. Linear regression was used to calculate the slope (SBR) of each timed killing curve for each drug concentration tested alone or in combination. In addition, the AUKC for each curve was calculated. To compare simulated infusion regimens further, the cumulative AUKC (the sum of AUKCs for specific time points along the serum concentration-time curve for each simulated regimen) was calculated. With the SBR assay or AUKC determination, there was a significant increase in the rate of killing of all test strains by the combination compared with gentamicin alone only at gentamicin concentrations which exceeded the MIC (8, 5, and 2.5 micrograms/ml). Mean cumulative AUKC of the simultaneous-infusion regimen was significantly less (indicating faster killing) than either the staggered-infusion regimen or the gentamicin infusion alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have also looked for interactions between hyperoxia and the aminoglycosides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Hyperoxia significantly enhanced bacteriostatic activity of nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim as measured by MIC testing. The possibility exists that these effects might be due to the method required to tests MICs under hyperoxic conditions rather than to the effect of hyperoxia itself. In addition, hyperoxia enhanced killing of bacteria by trimethoprim as measured by MBC testing. Hyperoxia decreased numbers of E. coli by 1.3 log10 and P. aeruginosa by 2.7 log10 in cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth medium. The bacteriostatic effects of hyperoxia did not affect MICs of gentamicin or tobramycin. The lack of interaction between hyperoxia and gentamicin or tobramycin was confirmed by determining the number of viable bacteria remaining after 24 h of exposure to hyperoxia by using a pour plate method. We conclude that hyperoxia potentiates the antimicrobial activity of the reduction-oxidation-cycling antibiotic tested (nitrofurantoin) and of one of the antimetabolites tested (trimethoprim). Hyperoxia does not enhance the bactericidal effects of gentamicin and tobramycin, which require oxidative metabolism for transport into bacterial cells.\r"

Our investigation was designed to establish the chemical and biological stability of gentamicin alone and in combination with cefazolin in peritoneal dialysis solution at 6 and 72 h by an immunoassay and by an in vitro bactericidal test against American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In addition, uninfected peritoneal dialysis effluent was inoculated with three American Type Culture Collection strains and gentamicin or imipenem. Gentamicin alone or in combination with cefazolin was not altered chemically and was bactericidal for Staphylococcus spp. but not P. aeruginosa. In contrast, imipenem was active against both Staphylococcus spp. and P. aeruginosa.

In vitro, toxic effects of artemether on S. mansoni were not seen at concentrations of less than 100 micrograms/ml. However, in vivo, 30 and 50% reductions in the lengths of male and female worms, respectively, were observed 14 days after treatment. By 56 days worm dimensions had returned to control values. Similar reversible effects on male testes and female ovaries were seen. In vivo, a single oral dose of artemether (300 mg/kg) induced a shift of worms towards the liver within 8 h after treatment. By 3 and 14 days after treatment, 99 and 76%, respectively, of worms were still in the liver. In vivo, the therapeutic effect of artemether on adult S. mansoni treated on day 56 after infection was modest. Doses as high as 1,200 mg (200 mg/kg per day, six doses) resulted in a worm reduction rate of only 39%. However, in infected mice treated on day 14 or 21 after infection, worm reduction rates of 83 to 98% were obtained. Thus, artemether exhibited modest in vitro and in vivo activities against adult S. mansoni but was twofold more active against 2- to 3-week-old liver-stage parasites.\r"

Such a glycopeptide susceptibility profile has not been previously described for E. faecalis. Time kill studies showed that vancomycin resistance adversely affected the synergistic activity that vancomycin and aminoglycoside combinations usually demonstrate against enterococci. However, the ability to detect vancomycin resistance varied with the susceptibility testing method used. Whereas broth microdilution, broth macrodilution, and agar dilution methods detected resistance, disk-agar diffusion and the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Positive GPS-A susceptibility card (Vitek Systems Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) did not. To detect vancomycin resistance reliably and establish the incidence of such E. faecalis isolates, adjustments in some susceptibility testing methods may be necessary.\r"

In only one patient was a single rise in aspartate transaminase activity noted, and this was without a corresponding rise in alanine transaminase. A second patient's serum contained hepatitis B core antibody transiently. It was thought likely in both cases that the abnormalities reflected intercurrent infections rather than disease associated with transfusion. The physical treatments used in the production of 8Y seem to inactivate the agent(s) responsible for non-A, non-B hepatitis and HIV transmission by transfusion of factor VIII has been abolished. There are, however, problems associated with conducting safety trials in young haemophiliac patients.\r"

Subjects were randomly allocated to receive one or other amino acid solution, but were otherwise given identical diets. At the start of the study the two groups did not differ significantly in postconceptual age, postnatal age, or weight. Over a six day study period on a stable intake of intravenous nutrients there was no significant difference in growth or nitrogen retention between the two groups. Plasma amino acid profiles in those receiving Vamin 9 glucose, however, were frequently abnormal. Notably, mean concentrations of potentially neurotoxic phenylalanine and tyrosine were significantly higher (140% and 420%, respectively) in patients fed Vamin 9 compared with those given Vaminolact. An amino acid solution based on the composition of breast milk protein therefore brings plasma amino acid profiles during parenteral nutrition closer to those found in breast fed infants, and reduces in particular, the risks of hyperphenylalaninaemia and hypertyrosinaemia.\r"

A previous study had found greater chelatable urine lead excretion in subjects with hypertension and renal failure than in controls with renal failure due to other causes, although mean blood lead concentrations averaged 0.92 mumol/l (19 micrograms/dl). To determine if chelatable urinary lead, blood lead, or the hematologic effect of lead (zinc protoporphyrin) were greater in hypertensive nephropathy (when hypertension precedes elevation of serum creatinine) than in other forms of mild renal failure, we compared 40 study subjects with hypertensive nephropathy to 24 controls having a similar degree of renal dysfunction due to causes other than hypertension. Lead burdens were similar in both the study and control groups as assessed by 72-h chelatable urinary lead excretion after intramuscular injection of calcium disodium EDTA (0.74 +/- 0.63 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.40 mumol per 72 h, respectively), and by blood lead (0.35 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.20 mumol/l). We conclude that subjects from a general population with hypertensive nephropathy do not have greater body burdens of lead than renal failure controls.\r"

Agents shown to elevate Cai2+ and to result subsequently in the death of some cells include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (in T4+ cells), 25-hydroxy cholesterol, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cyclosporine, dexamethasone, alpha-interferon, and Ca2+ ionophores. The effects of these agents, both on Cai2+ and on cytotoxicity, are additive. This type of Ca2+-related cytotoxicity may be associated with either accelerated synthesis of triglycerides (TNF), accelerated synthesis of cholesterol ester (25-hydroxy cholesterol), or cholesterol (HIV) and terminally with declining synthesis of structural phospholipid. Agents that can lower Cai2+ (e.g., phorbol esters, diglycerides, lipoproteins [LDL], oleic acid, or serum) under appropriate conditions ameliorate the Ca2+-induced cytotoxicity. Metabolism of other divalent metals, i.e., Zn2+ and Cd2+, also become altered with cell injury, e.g., glucocorticoids elevate Cai2+, but block uptake of Zn2+. These observations support the idea that chronic elevation of Cai2+ by many chemically unrelated agents leads to cell death by creating imbalance both in cell biosynthetic mechanisms--especially in those controlling lipid metabolism--as well as creating imbalances in metabolism of other trace metals, especially Zn2+.\r"

Titration of gastric contents with antacid was the first prophylactic treatment regimen proved to decrease the incidence of bleeding and remains the standard by which other methods are compared. We designed a prospective double-blind, double-placebo study comparing the effectiveness of antacid titration with fixed doses of a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog (misoprostol) for preventing stress gastritis and bleeding. To assess the success of each treatment regimen, we did endoscopic examinations before operation, 72 hours after operation, and after the patient had completed the study. A total of 281 patients entered the study (140 misoprostol, 141 antacid). The two groups were comparable with respect to preoperative parameters and type of operation. We found no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups concerning upper gastrointestinal tract lesions or serious adverse effects. No clinically evident upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in either group. Mean gastric pH, measured at two-hour intervals during the initial 72 hours, was maintained at 4.0 or higher in both groups. We conclude that fixed-dose misoprostol is as effective as intensive antacid titration in preventing stress ulcers and bleeding in surgical ICU patients.\r"

Isradipine or propranolol was titrated during a 10-week double-blind phase to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg while a fixed dose of hydrochlorothiazide was maintained. Supine diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 10 mm Hg in 88% of the isradipine/hydrochlorothiazide-treated and 83% of the propranolol/hydrochlorothiazide-treated groups and to less than 90 mm Hg in 55% of the isradipine/hydrochlorothiazide-treated and 69% of the propranolol/hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients. There was no significant difference in supine blood pressure reduction between either group, but there was a 3-to 4-beats per minute increase in supine heart rate in isradipine-treated patients and an expected 15- to 20-beats per minute decrease in heart rate in propranolol-treated patients. Five of 7 patients in the isradipine-treated group and 8 of 9 patients in the propranolol-treated group discontinued the therapy because of adverse reactions or treatment failure. Using Fisher's Exact Test, we found no significant difference in the relative frequency of individual adverse reactions between groups, although the absolute adverse reaction frequency was significantly higher with isradipine. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of supplemental isradipine in the treatment of hypertension not controlled by hydrochlorothiazide alone.\r"

The total Yale-Brown Scale score was significantly correlated with two of three independent measures of obsessive-compulsive disorder and weakly correlated with measures of depression and of anxiety in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder with minimal secondary depressive symptoms. Results from a previously reported placebo-controlled trial of fluvoxamine in 42 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder showed that the Yale-Brown Scale was sensitive to drug-induced changes and that reductions in Yale-Brown Scale scores specifically reflected improvement in obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms. Together, these studies indicate that the 10-item Yale-Brown Scale is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing obsessive-compulsive disorder symptom severity and that it is suitable as an outcome measure in drug trials of obsessive-compulsive disorder.\r"

This case illustrates the need for care in interpreting biopsy specimens of cutaneous fungal infection in the immunocompromised host, since proper treatment is determined by the specific agent present. The morphological features of fungi in tissue sections and histopathologic patterns of host response in the immunocompromised patient may be misleading in trying to identify fungal pathogens. At present, culture is the most reliable method for identifying pathogenic fungi and should be utilized to confirm appropriate therapy.\r"

Levels of serum thyroxine, free thyroxine, and thyroxine binding globulin were decreased after both 2 and 12 months of therapy with carbamazepine. Low serum thyroxine and free thyroxine concentrations were also found after long-term monotherapy with carbamazepine. Baseline thyrotropin did not change during carbamazepine therapy, but thyrotropin responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone rose slightly. No correlation was found between serum carbamazepine and hormone concentrations. The results not only support previous suggestions that carbamazepine induces the hepatic clearance of thyroid hormones but also suggest that carbamazepine may have an inhibitory effect at the hypothalamic level.\r"

  ".W": "New or used extended-wear soft contact lenses, preincubated in suspensions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were placed on the corneas of rabbits. The lids were then sutured shut for either 1 or 2 weeks. Bacterial keratitis occurred in 9 of 9 eyes fitted with the used contaminated lenses but in none of 12 eyes fitted with new contaminated or new noncontaminated lenses. Similar experiments were carried out with other lenses specifically designed to fit the cornea of rabbits. Some of these lenses were preworn by rabbits for 1 week (used), whereas others were new. A significantly greater incidence of bacterial keratitis was found in eyes that had undergone lid closure after the placement of used contaminated lenses (4 of 5) than in closed eyes with new contaminated lenses (1 of 8) and in open eyes with used contaminated lenses (0 of 13). These findings suggest that extended eyelid closure is a risk factor in the experimental model and may be a factor in clinical Pseudomonas keratitis associated with the wearing of extended-wear soft contact lenses.\r"

  ".W": "The majority of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fluid lymphocytes (SFL) demonstrate markers that are suggestive of prior activation. While the mechanism(s) responsible is unknown, prior studies have suggested that certain Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) antigens may preferentially activate SFL in vitro. We therefore examined the ability of RA SFL to respond to purified protein derivative and an acetone-precipitable MT antigenic complex (AP-MT) and compared this with the responses by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The responses were contrasted with those elicited with tetanus toxoid (TT) and mitogenic anti-CD3. In patients with RA, the SF proliferative responses to both TT and anti-CD3 were reduced compared with responses by PB. In contrast, the SF response to purified protein derivative was maintained, and that to AP-MT was significantly increased, compared with PB. SF responses to AP-MT antigens were significantly greater than those to TT. The AP-MT activation of T lymphocytes from RA SF was characterized by an earlier peak proliferative response than that noted with matched PB. AP-MT responsiveness was not restricted to HLA-DR4 positive patients. These observations suggest that an epitope(s) contained within the MT complex of antigens, and enriched in the AP-MT complex, may be important in maintaining the chronic inflammation in at least some patients with RA.\r"

Despite the differences in the response kinetics, the stimulatory capacity of SF dendritic cells was similar to that of PB dendritic cells in a 7-day mixed leukocyte reaction. We also tested the responsiveness of normal and RA PB T cells to various allogeneic dendritic cells and found that RA PB T cells responded poorly to both rheumatoid variant SF dendritic cells and normal PB dendritic cells. However, when dendritic cells from RA SF were used as stimulators, the response of RA PB T cells was significantly greater than that of normal PB T cells (P less than 0.02). This difference in response was explained in part by a proliferation of the CD8 T cell subset. There was also a shift of low-intensity CD4+, CDw29+ cells to high-intensity CD4+, CDw29+ cells seen in RA PB T cells but not in normal PB T cells, by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis.\r"

In isolated Tyrode-perfused rat kidneys, previously constricted with norepinephrine, serotonin or BaCl2, tertatolol evokes vasodilatation. These dilator responses cannot be explained by an interaction of tertatolol with alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors, muscarinic or nicotinic receptors, opioid receptors, dopamine receptors or histamine receptors, and they occur independently of the release of prostaglandins. Since methylene blue, an inhibitor of the soluble form of guanylate cyclase, reduces the renal dilator effect of tertatolol, this action could ultimately depend, at least in part, on the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate; in this respect, the renal effects of tertatolol and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) are different. From experiments performed with canine renal arteries and with the perfused rat mesentery, it can be concluded that the effect of tertatolol is more pronounced at the level of the resistance vessels. The in vitro renal dilator response observed with tertatolol may help to explain the beneficial effect on the renal circulation observed in both humans and experimental animals treated with the compound.\r"

The aims of the present study were (1) to document the central and renal hemodynamic effects of tertatolol in normal subjects and (2) to look for a possible interaction between tertatolol and products of the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. Five mg of tertatolol, 1 g aspirin, 5 mg tertatolol together with 1 g aspirin, and placebo were administered to 8 healthy volunteers at 1 week intervals in a random order and in a double-blind fashion. Cardiac output was measured by cardiac Doppler echography and renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate by constant infusion techniques using I123-iodohippurate and Cr51-EDTA respectively. Measurements were performed before and then successively 2 and 4 h after oral intake of drugs or placebo. Tertatolol alone or with aspirin significantly decreased heart rate and cardiac output (P less than .05) without change in blood pressure, renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate. The renal fraction of cardiac output was increased by tertatolol alone or with aspirin (P less than .05). Either placebo or aspirin alone had no effect. Thus tertatolol redistributes cardiac output to the kidneys in normal subjects as previously reported in hypertensive patients. This favorable effect on renal hemodynamics appers unlikely to be mediated by a local release of vasodilating prostaglandins.\r"

Pretreatment sinus aspirates were positive for 63 of 134 sampled sinuses. Of specimens yielding at least 10(4) CFU/mL, Haemophilus influenzae (38%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (37%) were the most common pathogens. Ten (42%) of 24 strains of H influenzae, 2 (40%) of 5 Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and all 3 isolates (60%) of Branhamella catarrhalis produced beta-lactamase. Cefuroxime axetil, 250 mg twice a day, was compared with cefaclor, 500 mg three times a day. Among culture-positive sinuses, bacteriologic cure was achieved in 36 (95%) of 38 sinuses and 15 (71%) of 21 sinuses treated with cefuroxime axetil and cefaclor, respectively. The overall frequencies of adverse events were similar between drugs, although cefuroxime axetil was associated with more frequent diarrhea. Cefuroxime axetil was an effective therapy for the treatment of acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis in adults.\r"

The increased distribution of sufentanil with hyperventilation was probably caused by an increased proportion of opioid in the nonionized state.\r"

  ".W": "Periods of preservation for donor corneas, even for short times, are necessary to facilitate optimum conditions in penetrating keratoplasty. However, current techniques for corneal storage at low temperatures may not provide optimal conditions for maintaining tissue integrity. In particular, the ionic composition of the storage medium has received little attention since it has been assumed throughout that the normal complement of ions in tissue culture media will also be suitable for preservation at reduced temperatures. This study extends our previous investigations on the merits of using CPTES (corneal-potassium-TES), a potassium-rich balanced salt solution containing an impermeant anionic pH buffer (TES), as a storage solution specifically designed to prevent the loss of intracellular potassium and minimise endothelial cell swelling during the time that the normal regulatory processes are switched off. The effect of adding the natural polymer chondroitin sulphate (CS) as a colloid osmotic agent to the hyperkalaemic storage medium is now examined. Corneas stored in CPTES containing 2.5% chondroitin sulphate retained a very high level of structural and functional integrity after three, five, and seven days storage at 0 degrees C; furthermore, stromal swelling was restricted to only 21%. All corneas stored in CPTES + 2.5% CS showed active endothelial function by thinning efficiently at rates that were greater than those previously reported for rabbit corneas stored for similar lengths of time in either M-K medium or K-sol. The zwitterionic buffers TES and HEPES were interchangeable in the hyperkalaemic solution and were non-toxic to corneal endothelium at a concentration of 100 mM. These compounds offer excellent pH buffering in bicarbonate-free medium.\r"

Scanning electron micrographs were used to grade corneal endothelial cell morphology in a masked manner in terms of cell shape, cell borders, cell swelling, and apical holes.

  ".W": "Regulation of cytoplasmic free calcium concentration is believed to be important in the response of platelets to external stimuli. A relatively new fluorescent calcium indicator, indo-1, has properties by which alterations of cytoplasmic calcium can be evaluated in single platelets by flow cytometry. Activation of platelets at a temperature lower than 37 degrees C allows examination of the heterogeneity of intracellular free calcium levels and can distinguish variations among platelets in the initiation, duration, and magnitude of calcium fluxes. The clear advantage of flow cytometric analysis of platelet cytosolic calcium is that stimulus-response coupling can now be studied on a single cell basis. Platelets were activated by addition of human alpha-thrombin or ADP at 37 degrees C or at room temperature (22 degrees C). Activation at 37 degrees C approaches more closely an in vivo response and, as expected, increases in cytosolic calcium occurred within seconds of agonist addition. Transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium levels occurred when platelets were challenged with a low concentration of agonist. Heterogeneity in cytoplasmic calcium levels was also observed at 10(-5) mol/L ADP and 0.1 U/mL alpha-thrombin. Some of this heterogeneity was no longer observed at higher concentrations of agonist (10(-4) mol/L ADP and 0.5 U/mL thrombin), suggesting that a sufficient magnitude of signal is required to induce changes in platelet cytosolic calcium. Light-scatter properties of the activated platelets were also monitored simultaneously and showed changes in response to both agonists. The ability to measure changes in cytoplasmic free calcium by ratio flow cytofluorimetry provides a new approach to study of the role of alterations in intracellular calcium in response to agonists acting through different membrane receptors as well as providing a sensitive technique to detect functional subpopulations of platelets.\r"

With this MoAb, we observed plasma clot lysis in vitro and evaluated the potential of JTPI-1 to serve as a new therapeutic agent for thrombolysis. After adding 125I-labeled fibrinogen to plasma, clots were made by adding thrombin and calcium and were then resuspended in normal plasma containing various concentrations of JTPI-1. The presence of JTPI-1 enhanced release of the soluble 125I-labeled fibrin degradation fragment from the clots in a dose-dependent manner. With tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)-depleted plasma, we showed that induction of clot lysis by JTPI-1 was dependent on fibrin-bound endogenous t-PA. Regulation of fibrinolysis initiated on the fibrin surface by fibrin-bound t-PA and plasminogen is mediated by alpha 2-PI cross-linked to fibrin by activated factor XIII. JTPI-1 bound to this cross-linked alpha 2-PI neutralized its activity and induced partial digestion of fibrin by plasmin. This resulted in additional binding of Glu-plasminogen to fibrin during the incubation. When 1.2 mumol/L JTPI-1 and 5 U/mL exogenous t-PA were present in the suspending plasma, the rate of clot lysis was essentially the same as that induced by 60 U/mL exogenous t-PA alone. These results suggest that JTPI-1 may be useful in reducing the amount of t-PA administered for thrombolytic therapy.\r"

TCR delta gene rearrangements or deletions were observed in all 50 T-cell neoplasms: 5 of 8 CD3- T-cell neoplasms showed rearrangements, whereas biallelic deletion of TCR delta gene was the most common pattern in CD3+ T-cell neoplasm (39 of 42 patients). Rearrangements of TCR delta gene were also detected in 23 of 40 immature B-cell leukemias, including 22 of 25 patients with rearrangements of TCR gamma gene, 2 of 17 mature B-cell neoplasms, and 3 of 30 myeloid leukemias. Thus, TCR delta gene rearrangement or deletion is always found in T-cell neoplasms and is frequently found in immature B-cell leukemias associated with TCR gamma gene rearrangement. Furthermore, TCR delta gene rearrangements associated with the germline configuration of the TCR beta, gamma, and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were observed in two immature T-cell leukemias, suggesting that TCR delta gene rearrangements precede TCR gamma and beta gene rearrangements. These results indicate that an analysis of TCR delta gene rearrangement provides potential tools to establish the clonality of immature T-cell neoplasms and to identify the normal stages of lymphocyte differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The production of interferons (IFNs), IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) and TNF-alpha (TNF-alpha) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) of untransfused and transfused, but otherwise untreated patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) was determined using bioassays and immunoassays. In untransfused and pretransfused SAA patients, spontaneous and lectin-induced production of these cytokines by PBMNCs was strongly enhanced. Cytokine production in untransfused SAA patients did not differ from that in pretransfused patients. Similar relative frequencies of activated (HLA-DR+) lymphocyte subpopulations present in the PBMNCs demonstrated cytokine overproduction per cells. Cytokine production was studied in three SAA patients before and after blood cell transfusions. Spontaneous and lectin-induced production of these cytokines was abnormally high and unaffected by blood transfusions. In another patient exhibiting abnormal cytokine production, the hematopoietic response to cyclosporin-A in vivo was accompanied by normalization of cytokine production in vitro. We conclude that overproduction of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by lectin-stimulated PBMNCs is an intrinsic abnormality of SAA unrelated to blood transfusions. Normalization of production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha accompanying a clinical response to cyclosporin-A may cautiously be taken as further evidence suggesting a pathogenetic role of cytokine overproduction in SAA.\r"

  ".U": "90057687\r", 
  ".W": "A new cell line, SUP-HD1, was established from the pleural effusion of a patient with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease (NSHD). The SUP-HD1 cells had the characteristic morphology of Reed-Sternberg cells and contained acid phosphatase and nonspecific esterase. The cells lacked the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome and reacted with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against CD15 (Leu-M1), CD25 (Tac), CD71 (OKT9), Ki67, and HLA-Dr. However, the SUP-HD1 cells were nonreactive with MoAbs that specifically identify T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophage/myeloid cells. Karyotype analysis of the cell line showed clonal abnormalities involving 1p13, 7p15, 8q22, and 11q23, chromosomal locations, at which breakpoints have been reported in HD. Southern blot analysis demonstrated rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain and kappa light chain genes as well as the gene for the beta chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR). Transcriptional analysis showed expression of RNAs for kappa light chain, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) but not IL-2. The SUP-HD1 cells lacked cytoplasmic and surface immunoglobulin heavy chain, but a small amount of cytoplasmic kappa light chain was detected. The presence of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B), a B-lymphocyte-associated transcription factor, was demonstrated in stimulated and unstimulated cells. In addition, the SUP-HD1 cell line, produced IFN-gamma, a T-lymphocyte-associated lymphokine. Based on these data, the SUP-HD1 cells appear to be aberrant lymphocytes with characteristics of both activated B and T lymphocytes. Elaboration of lymphokines such as IFN-gamma by the malignant cells may represent one explanation for the unique clinical and pathologic features of HD.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the incidence of the AIDS dementia complex and the presence of HIV I p24 antigen in cerebrospinal fluid in relation to zidovudine treatment. DESIGN--Retrospective study of a consecutive series of patients with AIDS from 1982 to 1988. SETTING--An academic centre for AIDS. PATIENTS--196 Patients with AIDS and neurological symptoms examined from 1982 to 1988. INTERVENTIONS--Zidovudine treatment, which was introduced to The Netherlands on 1 May 1987 for patients with severe symptoms of HIV infection (Centers for Disease Control groups IVA, B, C, and D). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Diagnosis of AIDS dementia complex and presence of HIV I p24 antigen in cerebrospinal fluid. RESULTS--The AIDS dementia complex was diagnosed in 40 of the 196 (20%) patients with AIDS. Thirty eight of 107 patients with AIDS (36%) not taking zidovudine developed the AIDS dementia complex compared with two of the 89 (2%) taking the drug (p less than 0.00001). The incidence of the AIDS dementia complex increased to 53% in the first half of 1987, after the introduction of zidovudine in May 1987, decreasing to 10% in the second half of 1987 and to 3% in 1988. Dementia was diagnosed before definition of the AIDS dementia complex (1986) according to DSM-III criteria and there was good agreement between diagnosis before and after 1986. Sixteen of 61 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (26%) from patients with AIDS (10 with the AIDS dementia complex) not taking zidovudine were positive for HIV I p24 antigen, whereas none of 37 cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with AIDS (two with the AIDS dementia complex) taking zidovudine were positive. CONCLUSIONS--The incidence of AIDS dementia complex in patients with AIDS declined after the introduction of systematic treatment with zidovudine; the AIDS dementia complex might be prevented by inhibiting viral replication in the central nervous system.\r"

Relative to men in England and Wales, mortality in the 1980s was significantly lower among dentists (standardised mortality ratio 66), doctors (69), opticians (72), and physiotherapists (79) and significantly higher among hospital porters (151), male nurses (118), and ambulancemen (109). Mortality from lung cancer among hospital porters (185) was more than fivefold that seen in doctors (33) and dentists (37). Ischaemic heart disease varied twofold, being lowest in dentists (60) and doctors (70) and highest in hospital porters (138). Over the decade mortality from lung cancer and ischaemic heart disease declined in all groups except hospital porters, ambulancemen, and orderlies. Most groups showed excess deaths from suicides and cirrhosis of the liver. Differences in mortality between health workers in social class I and those in social class IV widened between the 1970s and 1980s and to a greater extent than among the general population. The high mortality of some groups within the NHS, and the fact that differentials between social classes have widened more than in the general population, suggest that the NHS needs to pay more attention to the health of its own staff.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Various adverse outcomes were tested, including maternal bleeding, hypertension, complications of labour and delivery, gestational age, Apgar scores, and neonatal abnormalities. The main outcome measure was birth weight. RESULTS--There were no differences whatsoever between mothers given a zinc supplement and those given a placebo.

DESIGN--Prospective study of children in general practice, comparison with historical controls. SETTING--A deprived inner city practice. PATIENTS--127 Children aged 13-24 months. Findings were compared with those in 110 children of the same age studied previously. INTERVENTIONS--All mothers received dietary education antenatally and in the first year after giving birth. Screening for iron deficiency (defined as mean cell volume less than 75 fl and haemoglobin concentration less than 105 g/l) and haemoglobinopathy (when appropriate) was offered for all children attending for immunisation against measles, mumps, and rubella over 12 months; capillary blood samples were taken after immunisation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Uptake of the screening programme expressed as the percentage of all children eligible for immunisation who were screened, and the effectiveness of the dietary education as shown by the prevalence of iron deficiency in the two groups. RESULTS--Altogether, 122 of the 127 (96%) children who attended for immunisation had their haemoglobin concentration and mean cell volume measured; 90% of all children aged 13-24 months in the practice were screened. Dietary education, clinical procedures, and counselling were incorporated successfully into the clinic's work. Ten children (8%) were iron deficient, all of whom responded to iron supplements, and eight had a haemoglobinopathy trait. In the previous study 110 children (70%) had been screened and 28 children (25%) had been iron deficient. The two groups were similar in terms of sex, social class, and ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS--Screening young children for iron deficiency, sickle cell disease, and thalassaemia when they attended for immunisation was acceptable and successful in a socially deprived inner city practice. Dietary education may have accounted for some of the reduction in the prevalence of iron deficiency that occurred over the two years.\r"

The North West Thames Paediatric Advisory Group has therefore reviewed the implications and consequences of implementing the safety net in respect of children's services. The group found that if a reasonable safety net was to be provided that enabled the services to stay within the projected junior staffing levels, maintain a balance, meet training needs, and reduce junior doctors' hours of work, then changes in the organisation of the services would be required. Examining the options available showed that to achieve a safety net within the projected numbers of junior staff at least six paediatric units in the region would have to close. It is doubtful if there is the political will to support the very radical changes that would be needed in the distribution of services if the government's recommendations in Achieving a Balance were to be implemented. The profession, the Department of Health, and the public must be made aware that the proposed changes in medical staffing will cause a fundamental change in the traditional pattern of delivery of health care.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare the efficacy and tolerability of hydrochlorothiazide, sustained release verapamil, and their combination in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. DESIGN--Randomised multicentre trial of 48 weeks' duration with a double blind comparison of hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil followed by an open trial of combined treatment for patients not achieving the target diastolic blood pressure (less than 90 mm Hg) during treatment with a single drug. SETTING--Outpatient departments in 10 clinics and 10 private practices of general practitioners or internists. PATIENTS--369 Hypertensive patients with a diastolic blood pressure of 95-120 mm Hg during a placebo run in period of two weeks. INTERVENTIONS--Initial treatment consisted of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide (n = 187) or 120 mg sustained release verapamil (n = 182) once daily (regimen I). If the target diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg was not achieved within four weeks doses were increased to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide or 240 mg verapamil once (regimen II) and twice daily (regimen III). Patients not achieving target blood pressure were given the combination of hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil--that is, 25 and 240 mg once (regimen IV) and twice daily (regimen V). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Blood pressure determined with a device permitting automatic repeated measurements with printouts. RESULTS--After eight weeks of treatment with a single drug 76 out of 178 (43%) and 101 out of 175 (58%) patients achieved the target blood pressure with hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil, respectively. During follow up until 48 weeks patients treated with verapamil reached the target blood pressure more often and at lower doses and were less likely to switch to combination treatment than patients randomised to hydrochlorothiazide treatment. Adding verapamil to hydrochlorothiazide was more effective than the addition of hydrochlorothiazide to verapamil. At the end of the study 42 out of 169 (25%) and 73 out of 163 (45%) patients initially randomised to hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil, respectively, were at target blood pressure without combination treatment. After adding verapamil to hydrochlorothiazide or hydrochlorothiazide to verapamil an additional 58 (34%) and 29 (18%) patients reached the target blood pressure, respectively. Altogether 92 out of 332 (28%) patients failed to achieve target blood pressure with regimen V. There were four, 10, seven, and seven withdrawals due to possible adverse effects to treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, verapamil, combining verapamil with hydrochlorothiazide, and combining hydrochlorothiazide with verapamil, respectively. CONCLUSIONS--In doses currently used in antihypertensive treatment verapamil was more effective than hydrochlorothiazide as a single agent and in combination in mild to moderate hypertension, whereas withdrawal rates caused by side effects possibly related to treatment were similar.\r"

  ".U": "90057785\r", 
  ".W": "To detect reasons for the difference in mortality between Scotland and England and Wales a measure of deprivation was studied, comprising overcrowding, unemployment of men, low social class, and not having a car. Data for Scotland for 1980-2 showed this measure to be strongly associated with mortality, with gradients being particularly steep in young adults. Deprivation was much severe in Scotland than in England and Wales. These findings suggest that much excess mortality may be ascribed to more adverse conditions. Standardising the mortality ratios to take account of the relative affluence and deprivation of the two populations led to the differentials observed being radically adjusted, while standardising for social class had little effect. Deprivation measures based on areas overcome many of the limitations associated with social class analysis and also show much greater discrimination between populations. Measures of deprivation apparently provide a powerful basis for explanation of health differences. Such measures should therefore form part of the 1991 census output to facilitate their use on a consistent basis.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether low dietary calcium intake and physical inactivity are risk factors for hip fracture among subjects aged 65 and over. DESIGN--Fifteen year follow up study of a large cohort of randomly selected elderly people living in the community, who had taken part in the 1973-4 survey of the Department of Health and Social Security, and for whom dietary and other data were recorded at initial interview and medical assessment. SETTING--Eight areas in Britain (England (five), Wales (one), and Scotland (two]. SUBJECTS--1688 Subjects living in the community, of whom 1419 subjects (720 men and 699 women) agreed to participate. 1356 Subjects completed a seven day dietary record and 983 (542 men and 441 women) agreed to be assessed by a geriatrician. RESULTS--Incidence of hip fracture increased with age and was higher in women than men. Comparison with matched controls showed no evidence that the risk of hip fracture was related to calcium intake: the odds ratio for the lowest third of dietary calcium compared with the highest was 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 3.9) after adjustment for smoking and body mass index. The adjusted odds ratio for the lowest third of outdoor activity compared with the highest was 4.3 (0.7 to 26.8), and that for grip strength was 3.9 (0.7 to 23.0). CONCLUSIONS--Reduced intake of dietary calcium does not seem to be a risk factor for hip fracture. Further evidence is provided that physical activity in the elderly protects against hip fracture.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To study changes from 1969 to 1983 in the prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction treated in a coronary care unit. DESIGN--Mortality follow up of all patients with definite acute myocardial infarction. SETTING--The coronary care unit of the Royal Melbourne Hospital, a tertiary referral centre. SUBJECTS--4253 Patients (3366 men, 887 women) admitted from 1969 to 1983. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Mortality recorded at discharge from hospital and 12 months after admission. RESULTS--Details of clinical findings, history, electrocardiograms, arrhythmias, and radiological findings were recorded on admission. Mean ages were 63 for women and 57 for men, and women had haemodynamically more severe infarcts than men. In the later years patients were older and had less severe infarcts. Overall, hospital mortality in men was 16.7% in 1969-73 and 8.5% in 1979-83 and declined in all grades of the Norris and Killip infarct severity indices compared with a constant 19.2% in women. Even after adjustment for age and severity by logistic regression, hospital mortality fell in men by an average of 8% (95% confidence interval 4% to 11%) a year but remained constant in women. By 1983 male mortality was 60% that of women of similar age and comparable severity of infarction. Mortality of hospital survivors at 12 months declined by 7% (4% to 9%) a year in both sexes, even after adjustment for age and severity, with a male to female mortality ratio of about 0.8. New indices were derived to predict mortality in hospital and at 12 months. CONCLUSION--The observed declines in mortality cannot be explained by changes in severity of infarction or in prognostic characteristics of patients.\r"

  ".W": "A survey of all 72 consultant gynaecologists in the West Midlands region was carried out to determine their views on colposcopy services. All districts provided a colposcopy service and 47 consultants practised colposcopy. The consultants differed considerably in their views on criteria for referring women for investigation after smears. All but one thought that a positive smear result was an indication for immediate referral but whereas 55 thought that women with one or more inflammatory smear should be referred, 17 did not believe this to be necessary. Sixty seven consultants thought a preoperative colposcopic assessment desirable, but 10 had to ration referrals because of limited resources. Four forms of treatment were used: 17 districts had a carbon dioxide laser, eight used low voltage diathermy loop excision, two had only a cold coagulator, and one used only cold cautery. There was widespread dissatisfaction with resources and about the increasing amount of time spent on the service at the expense of other work. Consultants were also concerned about the relevance of much of what was done to the aim of the screening programme--reducing mortality from cervical cancer. Although additional resources are needed in some districts, referral policies, indications for colposcopic assessment, training, choice of treatment, and the value of follow up need to be reviewed if the service is to be improved.\r"

Surface electroencephalography (EEG) can be misleading and confirmatory evidence, preferably non-invasive, of the site of the epileptic focus is valuable. Sixteen patients with partial epilepsy, six of whom were considered to be good surgical candidates, had technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (99Tcm-HMPAO) scanning. In those patients with poor epileptic control and a well localized EEG focus, there was a correlation between EEG and HMPAO scan abnormalities, whilst in all patients where no correlation existed, the HMPAO scan was normal. We conclude that 99Tcm-HMPAO single photon emission computed tomography may be a useful non-invasive, adjunctive investigation in the preoperative assessment of patients with partial epilepsy.\r"

All but one patient have developed ovarian failure with persistently elevated gonadotrophin levels (FSH and LH greater than 32 IU/litre) and low serum oestradiol values (less than 40 pmol/litre) before the age of 16 years. The majority (n = 12) did not progress beyond breast stage 1 without sex steroid replacement therapy. As the number of oocytes within the ovary declines exponentially by atresia from approximately 2,000,000 at birth to approximately 2000 at the menopause, we have been able to estimate that the LD50 for the human oocyte does not exceed 4 Gy.\r"

Ultrastructural studies of these cells demonstrated increased disruption when compared with those obtained from normal subjects without catheters or chronic infection. The findings suggest that bladder irrigation further damages the already disrupted urothelium, which may in turn increase the predisposition of the bladder to the recurrent infections, commonly associated with patients who have indwelling urinary catheters.

Concentration-dependent relaxation responses to the endothelium-dependent dilators methacholine, ATP, and the calcium ionophore (A23187) as well as to the endothelium-independent dilators sodium nitroprusside and isoproterenol were obtained before, during, and after exposure to hypoxia (PO2 = 42 +/- 1 mm Hg) in the presence of indomethacin (2.8 x 10(-5) M). This moderate degree of hypoxia inhibited (p less than 0.05) endothelium-dependent but not endothelium-independent relaxation responses without producing irreversible vascular damage. In parallel experiments, cyclic GMP accumulation in pulmonary vascular rings in response to maximal doses of the above vasodilators was measured in the presence and absence of hypoxia. Cyclic GMP accumulation in response to endothelium-dependent dilators (methacholine, ATP, and A23187) was inhibited (p less than 0.05) by hypoxia while cyclic GMP accumulation in response to the endothelium-independent dilator sodium nitroprusside was not. When phenylephrine precontracted vessels were exposed to hypoxia in the absence of vasodilators, a small, transient increase in tension occurred, which was greater in endothelium-intact than in endothelium-denuded vessels (0.70 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.09 +/- 0.03 g, respectively; p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We used a crossover experimental design administering five class I agents and one class III agent, by intravenous bolus followed by intravenous infusion. The class I agents other than lidocaine were almost uniformly effective in terminating the arrhythmia (disopyramide in six of seven dogs, propafenone in six of six, flecainide in seven of seven, and SC-40230 in seven of seven). Termination was preceded by a marked increase in cycle length (ranging from +78% with propafenone to +55% with disopyramide), but with the exception of disopyramide, class I agents did not significantly shorten the excitable gap. With disopyramide the gap decreased from 49 +/- 3% to 28 +/- 3% of the cycle length. With no class I agent did the wavelength of effective refractoriness increase to approach the cycle length of the arrhythmia. Lidocaine, used as a negative control, terminated the reentry in one dog with modest prolongation of the cycle length. Terminations with class I agents correlated with depression of conduction rather than prolongation of refractoriness. In contrast with class I agents, D-sotalol prolonged the cycle length minimally (+10%) and terminated the arrhythmia in six of seven dogs. It decreased the excitable gap from 42 +/- 4% to 26 +/- 6% of the cycle, but it still did not cause the wavelength of effective refractoriness to equal the cycle length. Terminations by D-sotalol seemed to result from either failure of the lateral boundaries of the circus path or reflection within the path.\r"

A bolus of H[14C]O3-, 51Cr-labeled erythrocytes, [36Cl-] and/or [3H]sucrose, and [3H]OH was injected through a catheter in the portal vein, and timed anaerobic blood samples were obtained from a catheter in the hepatic vein. Experiments were carried out in untreated controls and after intravenous infusion of acetazolamide (100 mg/kg). In the controls, the H[14C]O3- curve was very similar to the [3H]OH curve. The dilution curves were all linear transformations of each other, indicating that HCO3-, as had previously been shown for the other diffusible tracers, undergoes delayed-wave flow-limited distribution. The distribution space for H[14C]O3- in the control situation includes the blood plasma and interstitial spaces, the erythrocyte interior modified by a Donnan equilibrium, and the available liver cellular space. The calculated HCO3- concentration in the liver cells was somewhat lower than that in the plasma space; the difference implied a cellular pH lower than that of plasma by approximately 0.08 pH units. When the carbonic anhydrases were inhibited with acetazolamide, the dilution curve for H[14C]O3- changed radically, approaching that for [36Cl-], which does not enter the liver cells. The change indicates that although HCO3-, like Cl-, is rapidly exchanged between plasma and erythrocytes, it also does not readily penetrate hepatocytes unless previously transformed to carbon dioxide by the carbonic anhydrases.\r"

Studies were performed in nine adult mongrel dogs 3.4 months after embolic occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery had been performed to stimulate collateral vessel growth. At the time of study the anterior descending coronary artery was cannulated to allow estimation of interarterial collateral flow from measurements of retrograde blood flow. Injection of radioactive microspheres during retrograde flow collection allowed simultaneous determination of continuing tissue flow for evaluation of microvascular collateral communications. Atrial natriuretic peptide in doses of 20 and 200 micrograms administered into the left atrium resulted in 17 +/- 3.0% and 34 +/- 4.5% increases in retrograde flow, respectively (each p less than 0.01). Tissue flow in the collateral dependent myocardial region did not change in response to atrial natriuretic peptide. After the larger dose of atrial natriuretic peptide, the administration of nitroglycerin (10 micrograms/kg into the left atrium) caused no further increase of retrograde blood flow, and no further decrease of collateral vascular resistance. These data indicate that atrial natriuretic peptide causes vasodilation of moderately well-developed interarterial coronary collateral vessels.\r"

  ".W": "During development, the cardiac alpha 1-adrenergic chronotropic response changes from positive in the neonate to negative in the adult. The negative chronotropic effect of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in the adult depends on maturation of sympathetic innervation and the presence of a pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein. To examine the possibility of a developmental change in coupling of a PT-sensitive G protein to the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, radioligand binding experiments with the iodinated alpha 1-selective radioligand [125I]-I-2-[beta-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylaminomethyl]tetralone ([ 125I]-IBE 2254) were performed on membranes prepared from control and PT-treated neonatal and adult rat hearts. Scatchard analysis showed fewer alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in the adult than in the neonate (168 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein in the neonate vs. 124 +/- 13 fmol/mg protein in the adult), but similar affinities (equilibrium dissociation constant 124 +/- 29 pM in the neonate vs. 140 +/- 34 pM in the adult). PT treatment did not alter the results. In both the neonate and adult, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p, 500 microM] shifted the l-epinephrine competition curve to the right and increased the slope factor toward unity. PT had no effect on the l-epinephrine competition curve in the neonate. However, in the adult PT itself caused a partial shift in the agonist competition curve, reducing but not eliminating the effect of Gpp(NH)p. Consistent with the results from the binding experiments, PT did not have any effect on the alpha 1-adrenergic-mediated positive chronotropic response in the neonate, whereas in the adult the alpha 1-adrenergic-mediated negative chronotropic response was completely converted to a positive one after PT treatment. These results indicate the presence of a PT-insensitive G protein in the neonatal and adult rat heart and the acquisition of a PT-sensitive G protein linked to the negative chronotropic response during development.\r"

After oral doses of tyramine, which caused systolic blood pressure to increase by 30 mm Hg, we determined plasma concentrations of p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPAA) and of conjugated and unconjugated tyramine. When 20 mg/day of selegiline was administered, the AUCspec of HPAA decreased from 86% to 64% and the AUCspec of conjugated tyramine increased from 13% to 35% of the sum of total tyramine and HPAA. Pressor sensitivity was enhanced more with oral administration of tyramine than with intravenous administration of tyramine. After the drug was discontinued, initial values were reached within 4 days (one subject) and 2 weeks (two subjects). Fifty-five percent of the selegiline dose was eliminated in urine as amphetamine and methamphetamine. The findings support the assumption that selegiline does not selectively inhibit monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) when administered in doses of 20 mg/day and higher.\r"

We therefore determined through plasma levels of S-(+)-flecainide and R-(-)-flecainide in 13 patients who were receiving long-term oral flecainide therapy. In addition, the effects of the enantiomers on action potential characteristics in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers were assessed. Plasma concentrations of R-(-)flecainide were significantly higher than those of the S-(+)-enantiomer (-/+ ratio, 1.10 +/- 0.13,mean +/- SD; range, 0.89 to 1.32, p less than 0.01), suggesting that the drug undergoes enantioselective disposition. In the in vitro experiments, both enantiomers reduced phase 0 action potential Vmax (an index of the fast inward sodium current) and shortened action potential duration at 50% and 90% repolarization, but no differences between the enantiomers were detected. The time constants for development of Vmax depression were significantly longer for S-(+)-flecainide (13.4 +/- 1.5 seconds) compared with R-(-)-flecainide (8.9 +/- 0.6 seconds, p less than 0.001). Thus, although S-(+)-flecainide and R-(-)-flecainide undergo modest enantioselective disposition, they exert similar electrophysiologic effects. These studies have provided no evidence to indicate that administration of a single enantiomer, rather that the racemic drug, would offer any advantage.\r"

In group I, urinary sodium excretion showed a marked increase during water immersion alone, whereas it was blunted during water immersion plus dopaminergic blockade with metoclopramide (P less than 0.05 vs water immersion alone, n = 5). Plasma aldosterone was significantly suppressed by water immersion alone (P less than 0.05), but remained unchanged during water immersion plus metoclopramide. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor showed similar augmentation during water immersion alone and during water immersion plus metoclopramide. 3. Another five subjects (group II) were studied during water immersion alone and during water immersion plus dopaminergic blockade with domperidone. In this group the increase in urinary sodium excretion was similarly blunted by dopaminergic blockade. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor was equally elevated during water immersion alone and during water immersion plus domperidone, but aldosterone was suppressed by both water immersion alone and water immersion plus domperidone. 4. Our findings suggest that water immersion-induced atrial natriuretic factor release is independent of dopaminergic activity. Dopamine blockade is able to blunt significantly both water immersion-induced natriuresis and plasma aldosterone suppression, independently of the marked elevation of circulating atrial natriuretic factor, via a mechanism involving type 2 dopaminergic receptors.\r"

The activities of phosphofructokinase (PFK), citrate synthetase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACDH) and cytochrome-c oxidase(Cyt-ox) in the calf muscle tissue were compared in subjects with intermittent claudication (n = 38) and controls (n = 20). The activities of CS, ACDH and Cyt-ox were increased and the activity of Cytox was positively correlated to the maximal walking distance (MWD) in the patients. 2. Thirty-three patients with intermittent claudication were randomized to three treatment groups: (1) operative surgery, (2) operative surgery supplemented with physical training and (3) physical training alone. Before and after 6-12 months of treatment, symptom-free walking distance (SFWD), MWD, ankle-brachial blood pressure quotient (ankle index), maximal plethysmographic calf blood flow (MPBF) and the activities of PFK, CS, LDH, ACDH and Cyt-ox were measured. 3. SFWD and MWD increased in all three groups. Ankle index and MPBF increased in groups 1 and 2, but were unchanged in group 3. The activities of Cyt-ox and CS decreased with operation, but the activity of Cyt-ox was further augmented with training in group 3. Overall, the change in ankle index explained 80-90% of the variability in walking performance. In a separate analysis, the increased activity of Cyt-ox in group 3 was positively correlated to, and explained 31% of the variability in, the improvement in SFWD. 4. These findings indicate that both physical activity and a reduced calf blood flow are necessary conditions for the enzymatic adaptation to take place. A causal relationship between metabolic adaptation in the muscle tissue and walking performance is suggested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "1. Hypertension is a complication of autologous bone marrow transplantation when therapy includes multiple alkylating agents. We have sought to identify the factors underlying this hypertension. We measured weight, serum creatinine, plasma renin activity, aldosterone and digoxin-like immunoreactive factor (DLIF), by digoxin radioimmunoassay, in 18 patients. Plasma catecholamines were also measured in five patients. 2. Of the 18 patients studied, 15 became hypertensive. The variable most consistently associated with these individuals' hypertension was DLIF activity which was increased in 14 of the 15 hypertensive patients (P = 0.055, Fisher exact test). Serum creatinine was increased at some point in seven of the 15 hypertensive patients, weight was increased in five and plasma renin activity and aldosterone were increased in one. Catecholamines were not increased in any of the five patients in which they were measured. 3. The association between changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and changes in DLIF for the group as a whole was assessed by analysing one data pair per patient, representing the maximal MAP. This correlation was significant (r = 0.75, P = 0.001). 4. Within individual patients, changes in MAP and changes in serum DLIF concentrations were significantly correlated (r greater than 0.50, P less than 0.05) in six of 15 hypertensive patients. 5. Digitalis-like factor (DLF) was measured by inhibition of (Na+,K+)-adenosine 5'-triphosphatase in five patients and DLF and DLIF were significantly correlated (r = 0.081, P = 0.0001). DLF and MAP were also significantly correlated (r = 0.59, P = 0.002). 6. This represents the first longitudinal study of the relationship between DLIF and blood pressure in hypertensive individuals, and the results suggest that DLIF may contribute to the increased blood pressure in some of these subjects.\r"

Aldosterone levels were elevated on the first day and atrial natriuretic peptide levels were higher on both altitude days compared with control. 3. Acute mountain sickness symptom scores showed a significant negative correlation with 24 h urinary sodium excretion on the first altitude day. Aldosterone levels tended to be lowest in subjects with low symptom scores and higher sodium excretion. No correlation was found between changes in haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume, 24 h urine volume or body weight and acute mountain sickness symptom score. 4.

Moreover, indomethacin alone (which decreases PG synthesis) had little effect on DNA synthesis in endothelial cells or C6 cells but inhibited colonic cancer cells. Conversely, misoprostol stimulated DNA synthesis in endothelial or C6 cells preincubated with indomethacin. This phenomenon was not observed with colonic cancer cells.

Parallel decreases occurred in active sodium efflux from jejunal enterocytes in the presence and absence of actively transported monosaccharides. Ileal enterocyte Na,K-ATPase and K-pNPPase activities were significantly increased, as was active sodium efflux. In contrast to controls, the presence of monosaccharides produced a stimulation of active sodium efflux from ileal enterocytes derived from infected rats. Enzyme and sodium transport changes in the jejunal enterocytes probably reflect cellular immaturity. Functional changes in ileal enterocytes probably represent a compensatory phenomenon.\r"

The basic defect is the absence of a lysosomal enzyme x-galactosidase A. This enzyme is necessary for the metabolization of ceramide trihexoside (globotriglycosyl ceramide), a breakdown product of cell membranes (4, 5). Clinically the disease is characterized by cutaneous angiokeratoma's and severe pain in the limbs from the second decade, followed by progressive renal insufficiency and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular damage in the third or fourth decade (6-8). In patients with established ACD, gastrointestinal symptoms have been described incidentally, mainly mild diarrhea (9, 10). We describe a kindred with ACD showing two extraordinary clinical features: (1) Anorexia, weight loss, and diarrhea were the presenting symptoms and antedated limb pain by many years, which has not been described before. (2) The disease was associated with another rare X-linked disorder: hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta.\r"

  ".W": "The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are bound by specific, high affinity binding proteins. Distinct classes of IGF-binding proteins have been described in human serum, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and conditioned medium from cultured cells. Sheep thyroid cells produce IGF-binding proteins under hormonal regulation. Cells grown without or with standard medium supplements (transferrin, glycyl-histidyl-lysine, hydrocortisone, somatostatin, insulin, and TSH) released binding proteins with apparent mol wt of 23, 29, and 32 kDa on Western ligand blot (nonreduced). Binding proteins from these cells appeared as 21, 26, 34, 36, and 41 kDa bands when cross-linked to [125I]IGF-I under reducing conditions. The addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or phorbol esters, thyroid cell mitogens stimulated the production of larger binding proteins with mol wt of 40-44 and 48-52 by ligand blot and cross-linking methods, respectively. Deglycosylation of conditioned medium cross-linked to [125I]IGF-I with endoglycosidase-F did not alter the size of the smaller binding proteins, but reduced EGF-stimulated binding proteins to 36-40 kDa. Similarly, tunicamycin treatment, which inhibits glycosylation, reduced only the size of this larger binding protein species. Polyclonal antisera directed against the human amniotic fluid binding protein (BP-28) immunoprecipitated the 32 kDa sheep thyroid binding protein seen on ligand blot and the cross-linked binding protein at 36-38 kDa. Antibody against the major human serum binding protein (BP-53) recognized only the larger EGF-stimulated binding proteins. In contrast to sheep thyroid cells, rat FRTL5 thyroid cells produced no detectable IGF-binding proteins. We conclude that the predominant binding proteins produced by sheep thyroid cells under standard culture conditions are non-glycosylated and immunoreact with antiserum directed against BP-28. EGF and phorbol esters stimulate production of larger glycosylated binding proteins antigenically related to BP-53.\r"

  ".U": "90059768\r", 
  ".W": "In an attempt to clarify the regulatory role in GH secretion of central alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic mechanisms, the effects of iv administration of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic antagonists and dopaminergic antagonists were investigated in undisturbed conscious male rabbits. During a 6-h observation period (1030-1630 h), control animals demonstrated spontaneous pulsatile GH secretion with mean (+/- SEM) 6-h GH levels of 6.49 +/- 0.54 ng/ml (n = 16). Intravenous injection of yohimbine (YOM; an alpha 2-antagonist), chlorpromazine (CPZ), and haloperidol (HAL; dopamine and alpha-adrenergic antagonists) completely suppressed this pulsatile GH secretion (mean 6-h GH levels, 2.98 +/- 0.24, 3.48 +/- 0.24, and 2.91 +/- 0.29 ng/ml, respectively; P less than 0.001), whereas prazosin (an alpha 1-antagonist), pimozide (a selective dopamine antagonist), sulpiride, and YM-09151-2 (YM; D2-specific antagonists) failed to affect the GH secretory pattern (mean 6-h GH levels, 6.61 +/- 0.73, 6.71 +/- 0.56, 5.44 +/- 0.44, and 6.87 +/- 1.44 ng/ml, respectively). While an iv injection of 2 micrograms synthetic human GH-releasing factor-(1-44)-NH2 (hGRF) induced GH rises in prazosin-, HAL-, pimozide-, sulpiride-, and YM-treated rabbits as well as control rabbits, YOM and CPZ completely abolished these GH responses to hGRF injection. An iv injection of 10 ml antisomatostatin gamma-globulin caused a prompt and transient GH rise, followed by a sustained elevation of GH trough levels in normal control rabbits. YOM treatment completely abolished this highly oscillated GH release. However, suppression by YOM or CPZ of hGRF-induced GH rises was significantly reversed by iv administration of 10 ml antisomatostatin gamma-globulin. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of YOM and CPZ on both episodic GH release and hGRF-induced GH rises is due to the enhanced release of somatostatin, with a simultaneous suppression of endogenous GRF. On the other hand, HAL, possessing a weaker alpha-blocking action than CPZ, blunted pulsatile GH secretion, but only modestly suppressed hGRF-induced GH rises. These results suggest the following. 1) Central alpha 2-adrenergic mechanisms play a more important role in the regulation of GH secretion than alpha 1-adrenergic mechanisms in the rabbit as well as in other species. 2) The alpha 2-adrenergic blockade causes suppression of the release of hypothalamic GRF and enhanced release of endogenous somatostatin, thereby suppressing GH secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Neonatal male rats were treated with monosodium glutamate (MSG) at either 2 or 4 mg/g BW on alternate days during the first 10 days of life. As adults, the 4 mg MSG-treated rats displayed the obesity, growth retardation, and reduced pituitary weights that typify this syndrome. These animals had no detectable plasma GH as determined from serial blood samples taken every 20 min for 8 consecutive h. Associated with this loss of circulating GH was an induction of the female-specific hepatic cytochrome P450 2d (gene IIC12) and the disappearance of the male-specific form of cytochrome P450 2c (gene IIC11). The catalytic activities of cytochrome P450 2c (i.e. androgen 16 alpha- and 2 alpha-hydroxylase), sex-dependent hexobarbital hydroxylase and total cytochrome P450 were similarly feminized. Rats exposed to the 2-mg dose of MSG were also obese, but their growth rates and pituitary sizes were not as severely affected as in the 4 mg MSG-treated rats. Circulating GH in these lower dosed males was secreted in a pulsatile pattern similar to that in normal males, except that the pulse amplitude was reduced as much as 90%. In spite of this profound decline in GH peak heights in the 2 mg MSG-treated males, liver metabolism was characteristically masculine. That is, female-specific cytochrome P450 2d remained undetectable, while the male forms of cytochrome P450 2c, 2a (gene IIIA2), and RLM2 (gene IIA2), their respective catalytic steroid hydroxylase activities, and associated sex-dependent drug-metabolizing enzymes were expressed at the level of or greater than that in normal males. Thus, while an ultradian pulse of circulating GH is necessary for the characteristically masculine profile of sex-specific forms of hepatic cytochrome P450, neither the amplitude of the secretory peaks nor their total GH content is critical, and these can be greatly reduced from the normal male levels.\r"

Addition of GTP (or its analogs 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate and guanosine-5'-O-[3-thiotriphosphate]) or sodium fluoride (in the presence or absence of GTP or its analogs) failed to induce 45Ca2+ flux into proteoliposomes, suggesting that the uptake of 45Ca2+ was receptor, and not G-protein, related. Voltage-independent (ruthenium red and gadolinium chloride) and voltage-activated (methyoxyverapamil and nifedipine) calcium channel-blocking agents reduced FSH-stimulated 45Ca2+ flux into proteoliposomes to control levels. FSH also induced uptake of 45Ca2+ by cultured rat Sertoli cells. Ruthenium red and gadolinium chloride had no effect on basal levels of 45Ca2+ uptake or estradiol secretion by cultured rat Sertoli cells, nor did methoxyverapamil or nifedipine. All four calcium channel blockers, however, were able to reduce FSH-induced 45Ca2+ uptake to basal levels and FSH-stimulated conversion of androstenedione to estradiol by up to 50%, indicating an involvement of Ca2+ in FSH-stimulated steroidogenesis. Our results suggest that the well documented changes in intracellular calcium levels consequent to FSH binding may be due, at least in part, to an influx of calcium through FSH receptor-regulated calcium channels.\r"

In addition, the effects of this tissue on eutopic GH and PRL release were simultaneously investigated. Anterior pituitary glands from adult female donor rats were grafted beneath the kidney capsule of adult male hosts. Four weeks later, this ectopic pituitary tissue and the eutopic pituitary glands of the host animals were removed, dispersed with trypsin, and subsequently assayed for GH and PRL release. Contrary to expectations, we found that 37% of the ectopic pituitary cells were GH secretors. Furthermore, these GH cells remained highly responsive to GRF (10(-7) M), which evoked a 7-fold increase (P less than 0.05) in mean GH plaque area. By comparison, only 28% of these ectopic cells secreted PRL, and this release was not consistently augmented by exposure to TRH (10(-7) M). In the second half of this study we found that the presence of ectopic pituitary tissue severely compromised the secretory capacity of the eutopic pituitary cells. More specifically, GH-releasing factor induced a 3-fold increase in GH secretion from the eutopic pituitary cells of sham-operated control animals, but it enhanced the release from cells of host animals by only 2-fold. Moreover, the response to TRH by the eutopic PRL cells from explant-bearing animals was curtailed to such an extent that it was not significantly greater (P greater than 0.05) than basal release in that group. We conclude that the potential of pituitary explant cells to release GH is far greater than previously believed and that this ectopic hormone production may inhibit hormone release from the eutopic pituitary cells.\r"

  ".U": "90059798\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the role of somatostatin (SRIF) in regulating sexually dimorphic GH secretion, we used a reverse hemolytic plaque assay and acutely dispersed somatotropes from age-matched normal male, normal female, and androgen receptor-deficient, testicular feminized (Tfm) rats. Hemolytic plaques were developed after a 90-min incubation in the presence of GH antiserum, 10 nM GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), and the following concentrations of SRIF: 0, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 nM. Additional studies were performed with 0 or 100 nM SRIF in the absence of GHRH. The absolute number of somatotropes (x10(6); mean +/- SEM) recovered from the pituitaries of Tfm rats (1.73 +/- 0.18) was significantly greater than that from the males (1.11 +/- 0.13; P = 0.01); the number from female rats (1.30 +/- 0.15) was not different from that of either male or Tfm animals. GHRH-stimulated GH secretion, as estimated by the mean GH plaque area (micron2 x 10(4); mean +/- SEM) in the absence of SRIF, was greater for somatotropes from male rats (3.36 +/- 0.41) than that for either Tfm (2.27 +/- 0.32; P = 0.02) or female (1.78 +/- 0.24; P = 0.001) rats; values for the latter two groups did not differ. However, mean GH plaque areas for each group during maximal SRIF inhibition in either the presence or absence of GHRH were indistinguishable from each other and from mean plaque areas obtained under basal conditions. As demonstrated by a lesser EC50 value (0.04 +/- 0.02 nM; mean +/- SEM), somatotropes from female rats were more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of SRIF than were those from either male (EC50 = 1.82 +/- 0.45; P = 0.0001) or Tfm (EC50 = 0.74 +/- 0.22, P = 0.0001) rats; values for the latter two groups were indistinguishable. These observed differences suggest that gender and/or the gonadal hormone environment may be important determinants of the inhibitory effects of SRIF on GH secretion by the somatotrope. While these gender-associated differences may represent effects of the gonadal hormones directly on the somatotrope, they could reflect modulation of the secretion of hypothalamic SRIF and/or GHRH by the prevailing gonadal hormone environment. Such gender-related differences may contribute to the overall sex-dependent patterns of GH secretion in the intact animal.\r"

  ".W": "Flow cytometry was recently introduced for the detection of antibodies in human serum to a cultured insulin-secreting rat insulinoma cell line (RINm5F) to investigate humoral immune reactivity in newly diagnosed type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients. Fifty-three patients were observed for 6-20 mo after clinical onset of diabetes with a reported duration of symptoms of less than 6 wk. Human anti-RINm5F antibodies were detected in 28%, human anti-islet cell antibodies in 62%, and anti-insulin autoantibodies in 36% of patients before initiation of insulin therapy. Occurrence of human anti-RINm5F antibodies at this stage was correlated with human anti-insulin autoantibodies rather than with the formation of anti-islet cell antibodies. Incidence of anti-RINm5F antibodies in individuals with duration of diabetes greater than 6 wk was 38%, whereas human anti-islet cell antibodies and anti-insulin antibodies became detectable in 72 and 61% of the patients, respectively. These findings are in line with previous reports of immunoprecipitation by human diabetic serums of a 64,000-Mr antigenic structure in freshly prepared rat islet cells. The results suggest a reactivity of distinct classes of antibodies in serums of patients with type I diabetes to disparate antigens on human islet cells and cloned rat insulinoma cells and, moreover, reactivity to insulin as the secreted product. Further characterization of the reacting RINm5F antigens and prospective studies in subjects at risk for diabetes are required to validate the application of RIN cells to the investigation of immune mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of human type I diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of the hemodynamic abnormalities of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is not well understood. Previous studies suggest that prostacyclin (PGI2) production by adipose tissue is increased in DKA. We investigated the role of PGI2 in the pathogenesis of the reduced vascular resistance in DKA. Rats with streptozocin-induced DKA were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, and flow was measured with an electromagnetic probe on the infradiaphragmatic aorta. The plasma level of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (stable derivative of PGI2) was higher (mean +/- SE 0.91 +/- 0.05 ng/ml) and vascular resistance lower (4.9 +/- 0.2 mmHg.ml-1.min-1.100 g-1 [resistance units, RU]) in 67 rats with DKA than in 21 normal rats (0.34 +/- 0.03 ng/ml, P less than .01, and 9.0 +/- 0.7 RU, P less than .01, respectively). Inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity with either indomethacin or meclofenamic acid reduced the plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha level but failed to raise vascular resistance. Infusions of PGI2 in rats with DKA demonstrated that the vasculature was responsive to PGI2. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity not only reduced PGI2 production but also suppressed renin release. When the effects of the renin-angiotensin system were excluded by bilateral nephrectomy, indomethacin caused a significant increase (P less than .05) in vascular resistance. Thus, the failure of cyclooxygenase inhibitors to raise vascular resistance in DKA was a result of concurrent suppression of vasodilator (PGI2) and vasoconstrictor (renin-angiotensin system) mechanisms that are activated in DKA. Insulin administration increased vascular resistance (P less than .01) and decreased the level of plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (P less than .01). Combined administration of PGI2 and insulin did not alter vascular resistance, suggesting that the increase in vascular resistance with insulin was predominantly due to the reduction of circulating PGI2. Thus, vascular resistance is decreased in DKA primarily as a result of the vasodilator effects of PGI2 produced by adipose tissue. The activation of the renin-angiotensin system represents a partial compensation. The increase in PGI2 production may contribute to the hypotension and mortality of DKA.\r"

Insulin treatment completely prevents the development of these changes. The proportion of atrial muscarinic receptors displaying high-affinity agonist binding is lower in STZ-D rats; however, the sensitivity of high-affinity agonist binding to regulation by a guanine nucleotide (5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate) is greater in atria from diabetic rats. Again, insulin treatment eliminates these differences. These findings indicate that alterations in atrial muscarinic systems in STZ-D rats are a consequence of the elaboration of the diabetic state and suggest that an alteration of functional muscarinic receptor-G protein coupling contributes to the altered physiological responsiveness of the heart in diabetes.\r"

The expression of these markers was assessed by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies. Thirty-two percent of freshly isolated colonic epithelial cells from actively inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease expressed the 4F2 antigen, 28% the transferrin receptor, and 13% the CALLA. Normal colonic epithelial cells were cultured and the kinetics of expression of the three antigens was studied. A significant increase in the expression of the three markers was observed throughout the culture period in response to the lectin phytohemagglutinin and the epidermal growth factor. The kinetics of expression of the 4F2 antigen and the CALLA after lectin stimulation appeared to differ from that observed after epidermal growth factor. At the end of the cultures one-third of the cells expressed the 4F2 antigen and the transferrin receptor, whereas one-fifth were positive for CALLA. Thus, after these cultures the expression of the three markers was quantitatively similar to that observed with freshly isolated cells from inflamed mucosa. gamma-Interferon markedly induced the 4F2 antigen but had no effect on the transferrin receptor and the CALLA. These data demonstrate that colonic epithelium is capable of expressing the 4F2 antigen and the CALLA in association with the transferrin receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Elemental diets designed for nutritional support in protein-calorie malnutrition are often deficient in choline, a nonessential nutrient. Previously, malnourished patients on these diets were found to be at risk of developing plasma choline deficiency. We have now estimated the prevalence of this deficiency by determining fasting plasma levels of choline among cirrhotic and noncirrhotic malnourished male subjects maintained on regular hospital mixed food or elemental parenteral and enteral formulas. Plasma choline concentrations (microM, average +/- SD) were as follows: (i) mixed foods, 11.3 +/- 4.3 for cirrhotic (n = 22) and 9.3 +/- 2.4 for noncirrhotic (n = 12) patients; (ii) parenteral formula, 5.3 +/- 1.6 for cirrhotic (n = 5) and 8.6 +/- 5.2 for noncirrhotic (n = 16) subjects; and (iii) enteral formula, 6.1 +/- 1.2 for cirrhotic (n = 5) and 11.7 +/- 1.9 for noncirrhotic (n = 4) subjects. The level for healthy normal subjects eating mixed foods was 12.0 +/- 2.2. The prevalence of plasma choline deficiency, i.e., plasma levels greater than or equal to 2 SD below the normal average, was as follows: parenteral formula, all cirrhotic and 10 of 16 noncirrhotic subjects; enteral formula, all cirrhotic and none of the noncirrhotic subjects. The reversibility of choline deficiency was examined in a longitudinal study of three phases involving 10 patients--5 with alcoholic cirrhosis (all on enteral formula); 5 noncirrhotic (1 on enteral and 4 on parenteral formula). During phase 1 (3-day equilibration period; ad libitum regular hospital diet), plasma choline levels were within the normal range for all subjects. During phase 2 (2 wk, choline depletion phase, elemental formulas), choline levels were subnormal in all cirrhotic subjects (5.1 +/- 2.0 microM) on enteral formula and all noncirrhotic patients on parenteral formula (5.9 +/- 1.3 microM). During phase 3 (2 wk, choline repletion phase, elemental formula + 6 g choline/day), the levels normalized in all patients (cirrhotic 11.4 +/- 3.1 microM and noncirrhotic 11.9 +/- 3.2 microM). Analyses of abdominal computed tomographic scans and plasma liver chemistries in the cirrhotic subjects during the three phases suggested a correlation between plasma choline deficiency and hepatic steatosis and abnormal liver enzyme levels in some patients. Therefore, choline may be an essential nutrient in malnourished cirrhotic patients and its deficiency may be associated with adverse hepatic effects.\r"

In contrast, a significantly greater (median: 17% for zymosan and 45% for PMA) proportion of macrophages isolated from inflamed colonic mucosa were able to undergo respiratory burst. Studies with normal and inflamed ileum showed similar results. Stimulation of macrophages isolated from normal colon with interferon-gamma produced only a small increase in the proportion of cells showing release of oxygen radicals. We conclude that the respiratory burst capacity of majority of macrophages isolated from normal colon and ileum is downregulated and a greater proportion of macrophages isolated from inflamed colon and ileum are able to undergo a respiratory burst.\r"

Fifty four patients denying laxative consumption had diarrhoea (mean daily stool weight greater than 200 g) of uncertain origin at their initial visit of whom 47 were screened to detect ingestion of anthraquinones, bisacodyl, phenolphthalein, and magnesium salts. Seven patients had positive tests. No single clinical feature could have predicted the outcome of the test. The possible cost savings of the programme were estimated by not releasing the results of the test to the clinicians until the patient's investigations were complete. The seven patients with laxative abuse spent a total of 35 days in hospital and were seen on 29 occasions in the outpatient clinic after the laxative screening test was positive. The cost of the screening programme was cheaper than the costs of the diagnostic procedures in patients with laxative abuse. We recommend the use of a comprehensive, early laxative screening programme in all patients with diarrhoea of uncertain origin as a cost effective procedure.\r"

High serum antibody titers against acetaldehyde-protein adducts have been found not only in alcoholics but also in patients with nonalcoholic liver disease, suggesting a contribution of acetaldehyde derived from sources other than exogenous ethanol. To investigate the effect of liver injury on the removal and the production of acetaldehyde, we produced fibrosis and cirrhosis (by chronic administration of carbon tetrachloride) and fatty liver (with very small doses of dimethylnitrosamine) in rats. Endogenous blood acetaldehyde levels increased by 38% in rats with severe liver injury (p less than 0.005), but not significantly in rats with fatty liver. However, an i.v. load of threonine (a physiological source of acetaldehyde), in amounts equivalent to the daily intake of this amino acid, increased blood and hepatic acetaldehyde levels in the rats with both types of liver injury more than in controls. Threonine dehydrogenase and dehydratase activities, involved in the major pathways for threonine degradation in mitochondria and cytosol, respectively, were markedly decreased in rats with liver injury with a resulting increase in hepatic threonine concentration. Moreover, the threonine aldolase activity, which splits threonine into glycine and acetaldehyde, remained unaffected or even slightly increased. Liver injury was also associated with impaired mitochondrial functions, including a 10 to 23% decrease in acetaldehyde oxidation (depending upon the severity of the lesions). As a consequence, administration of ethanol (an exogenous source of acetaldehyde) resulted in striking elevations in the levels of acetaldehyde in carbon tetrachloride-treated rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to evaluate, using a double-blind technique, the efficacy of the association of transdermal nitroglycerin to vasopressin infusion for the treatment of variceal bleeding. Sixty-nine cirrhotic patients with active variceal bleeding were randomly allocated to receive vasopressin (0.4 to 0.8 unit per min until variceal bleeding has been controlled for 12 hr) associated with nitroglycerin administered transdermically in a slow-release preparation (10 mg in 24 hr) or placebo. An initial control of variceal hemorrhage was achieved in 83% of the patients receiving vasopressin-nitroglycerin and in 74% in the vasopressin-placebo group. Owing to a lower frequency of recurrent bleeding during therapy (18 vs. 42%, p = 0.11), vasopressin-nitroglycerin achieved a definitive control of bleeding in a higher proportion of patients than vasopressin-placebo (73 vs. 54%, p = 0.13). The group treated with the drug combination showed favorable results in relation to transfusion requirements (2.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.5 units, p = 0.05), total dose of vasopressin required (453 +/- 47 vs. 587 +/- 50 units, p less than 0.05), need of balloon tamponade (6 vs. 15, p less than 0.05) and requirement for emergency surgery (0 vs. 4, p = 0.07). There were no significant differences in the undesirable effects associated with treatment, observed in 37 and 49% of cases, respectively. Hospital mortality was similar (33 vs. 25%). This study demonstrates that transdermal nitroglycerin improves the effectiveness of vasopressin for controlling variceal hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist, has been advocated as a new treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. This drug is extensively metabolized by the liver in normal subjects. In the present study, we examined Ro 15-1788 disposition in eight healthy controls (Group I), eight cirrhotic patients with moderately impaired liver function (Pugh score less than 10, Group II) and eight patients with severe liver dysfunction (Pugh score greater than 10, Group III). The subjects of each group were age and sex matched. After an intravenous infusion of 2 mg Ro 15-1788 over 5 min, blood samples were taken at fixed intervals up to 7 hr after the infusion. Plasma levels of the drug were determined by capillary gas chromatography. In controls, Ro 15-1788 had a high plasma clearance [16.3 +/- 2.6 ml per min per kg (mean +/- S.D.)], a short half-life (45.7 +/- 8.5 min), a large volume of distribution (0.62 +/- 0.09 liter per kg) and a low plasma protein binding (45 +/- 6%). Plasma clearance was reduced markedly in both groups of cirrhotic patients (-57 and -74%, respectively); the volume of distribution was unchanged in Group II and moderately increased in Group III (+37%). The elimination half-life was markedly prolonged in Groups II and III (+66 and +210%, respectively). Plasma clearance and Pugh score were highly correlated in cirrhotic patients (r = 0.830, p less than 0.001). The plasma protein binding of Ro 15-1788 was lower in cirrhotics, resulting in a significant increase in the free fraction of the drug (+16% in Group II; +44% in Group III).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The extent to which the natriuretic effect of a prolonged low dose infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (30 ng/kg/min) is dependent on interference with the prevailing intrarenal actions of angiotensin II was examined before and after blockade of angiotensin production with the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (5 mg/kg). Lithium clearance was used to assess proximal tubular sodium and water reabsorption. Atrial natriuretic factor and enalaprilat caused similar increases in sodium excretion (10-fold and sevenfold, respectively) and glomerular filtration rate (each 34%) and similar decreases in fractional proximal reabsorption of sodium (17% and 13%, respectively) and blood pressure. Each also caused a major disruption in the effectiveness of proximal glomerulotubular balance (30% and 50% of perfect balance). Infusion of atrial natriuretic factor during converting enzyme inhibition increased glomerular filtration rate further by 23%, reaching 63% above control without change in renal blood flow but with a rise in filtration fraction to 0.48. Sodium excretion increased further but fractional proximal sodium reabsorption remained constant and proximal glomerulotubular balance appeared to improve. Atrial natriuretic factor therefore possesses a glomerular action that persists during converting enzyme inhibition and is indeed additive to the removal of angiotensin II when the proximal effect of atrial natriuretic factor is no longer apparent. It is concluded that failure of atrial natriuretic factor to further suppress fractional proximal sodium reabsorption during converting enzyme inhibition is caused by either prior removal of the stimulatory action of angiotensin II on proximal tubular transport or extreme changes in peritubular physical factors consequent on the high filtration fraction.\r"

  ".W": "Our purpose was to analyze hospital cost, resource utilization, and outcome by age for a large group of patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) services. Patients in the ICU (N = 6331) were stratified by age groups. Mean hospital cost per patient generally increased with age. Older patients (65 years of age and older) who were treated in the ICU had longer hospital lengths of stay, higher mortality rates, and a greater percentage of outlier patients, as compared with younger patients (under 65 years of age). Patients in the ICU would have produced a substantial loss for our medical center under a diagnosis-related group (DRG) all payer prospective payment scheme. Although higher mean costs were associated with older patients, every age group of patients in the ICU that we examined demonstrated a loss under DRGs. As a whole for the 3-year period, patients in the ICU would have generated more than +30 million in losses for our medical center. These losses were a result of a variety of factors, including a greater severity of illness and greater hospital resource utilization. The current DRG hospital payment system appears to be inequitable for the patient who receives treatment in the ICU during the hospital stay. As hospital operating margins continue to decline because of federal and state DRG hospital payment systems, additional pressures may be applied for physicians, nurses, and health care professionals to cut expenses for these patients. In this effort to watch the bottom line, physicians and nurses must not sacrifice the quality of or the access to care for patients who require ICU services.\r"

  ".U": "90062409\r", 
  ".W": "We recently reported that a low dose dopamine (DA) infusion in normal subjects increased renal blood flow (RBF) via prostacyclin (PGI2) formation without changes in PGE2 levels. The present study explores whether this mechanism is mediated by the DA1 receptor and evaluates the effect of DA on RBF and PGs in subjects with essential hypertension (EH). A low dose of DA (1 microgram/kg.min), which previously did not alter hemodynamics in normal subjects was infused into eight patient with EH to determine the role of DA stimulation in hypertensives. To assess the effect of DA1 stimulation, fenoldopam, a selective DA1 agonist, was infused (0.1 microgram/kg.min) into 10 normal and 10 hypertensive patients. Fenoldopam, unlike DA, significantly decreased diastolic blood pressure in hypertensives (96 +/- 3 to 85 +/- 2 mm Hg; P less than 0.01) along with a significant increase in pulse rate (68 +/- 2 vs. 73 +/- 2 beats/min; P less than 0.01). RBF measured by para-aminohippurate clearance increased only in normals during fenoldopam infusion from 1185 +/- 71 to 1533 +/- 84 L/min.m2 (PGI(2)01), and this was associated with an increase in PGI2 (6-keto-PGF1) excretion (149 +/- 19 vs. 214 +/- 32 ng/g creatinine; P less than 0.02). These effects of fenoldopam were similar to DA effects on RBF and PGI2 excretion in normals. In contrast, in hypertensive subjects, neither fenoldopam (867 +/- 113 vs. 1054 +/- 177 L/min.m2; P greater than 0.1) nor DA (1098 +/- 85 vs. 1061 +/- 101 L/min.m2; P greater than 0.1) increased RBF. Similarly, neither the DA nor the fenoldopam infusion stimulated PGI2 excretion in the hypertensives. The fenoldopam infusion in the hypertensives produced a significant natriuresis (22 +/- 3 to 49 +/- 9 mmol/3 h; P less than 0.05). Similar effects on Na+ excretion in this group were noted during DA infusion (17 +/- 3 to 36 +/- 3 mmol/3 h; P less than 0.05), suggesting that DA-induced natriuresis is not directly linked to DA-induced changes in RBF or PG excretion. The present study shows that in normal subjects, fenoldopam, a specific DA1 agonist, like DA, stimulates renal PGI2 release and RBF. In contrast, neither DA nor fenoldopam alters PGI2 or RBF in patients with EH, suggesting an alteration of dopaminergic tone in some hypertensives that is characterized by a defect in DA1 receptor sensitivity.\r"

  ".U": "90062410\r", 
  ".W": "Twenty-seven patients with Cushing's disease underwent transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. After the operation 16 patients were cured, and 11 remained hypercortisolemic. In the cured patients a significantly lower incidence of paradoxical responsiveness to TRH or to LRH was found preoperatively (1 of 16) than in the failures (6 of 11; P less than 0.02, by Fisher's chi 2 test). Furthermore, responsiveness of cortisol to CRH administration was significantly lower in the failures [maximum, 0.30 +/- 0.10 mumol/L (10.8 +/- 3.6 micrograms/dL) vs. 0.50 +/- 0.07 mumol/L (18.1 +/- 2.5 micrograms/dL) in the cured patients; P less than 0.05]. There were no differences in basal plasma cortisol levels, ACTH levels, or suppressibility by dexamethasone between the 2 groups. In the 16 patients who were cured initially, 4 patients relapsed after a mean period of 4 yr. These 4 patients had significantly higher basal cortisol levels postoperatively than those who remained in remission [0.14 +/- 0.03 mumol/L (5.1 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dL) vs. 0.04 +/- 0.01 mumol/L (1.4 +/- 0.3 micrograms/dL); P less than 0.01]. Cortisol responses to CRH after the operation positively correlated with the basal cortisol levels at that time (P less than 0.05, by Spearman's rank correlation test; r = 0.64), thus, the relapsing patients had higher cortisol responses to CRH than patients who stayed in remission [maximum response, 0.31 +/- 0.07 (11.2 +/- 2.5 micrograms/dL) vs. 0.12 +/- 0.03 mumol/L (4.3 +/- 1.1 microgram/dL), respectively; P less than 0.05]. We conclude that 1) patients responding paradoxically to TRH and/or LRH have a lower chance of being cured after pituitary surgery; and 2) patients with higher cortisol levels (greater than 0.10 mumol/L; 3.6 micrograms/dL) after being cured initially have a higher chance of recurrence of their disease.\r"

  ".W": "Age-related bone loss has been attributed to a decline in bone formation due to decreased osteoblast function. However, studies examining the relationship between age or menopausal status and indices of bone formation such as serum osteocalcin have yielded conflicting results. To examine these relationships we studied indices of bone formation and resorption and bone mineral density in 247 normal women, including 96 postmenopausal women ranging in age from 20-75 yr. A cubic polynomial regression best fit the relationship between age and serum osteocalcin (r = 0.32; n = 228; P = 0.0001) and urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine excretion (r = 0.40; n = 228; P = 0.0001), with both indices declining before the menopause, rising at the menopause, and subsequently falling through the seventh and eighth decades. While a significant decline in osteocalcin levels was observed in the postmenopausal group older than 60 yr, levels in subjects older than 60 yr remained higher (+31%) than those in late premenopausal subjects. Urinary calcium to creatinine excretion rose in the premenopausal years, increased markedly after the menopause, and remained at this level subsequently. Urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine, but not serum osteocalcin or urinary calcium/creatinine excretion, was a significant predictor of bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and the femoral neck independent of age. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that age-related bone loss after the menopause occurs in the presence of initially increased but subsequently decreasing bone turnover with maintenance of a relative excess of bone resorption.\r"

  ".W": "Human follicular fluid contains the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP-1) synthesized by ovarian granulosa cells. We studied the regulation of IGFBP-1 production by the granulosa-luteal cells from the hyperstimulated follicles of patients attending an in vitro fertilization program. The cells were first allowed to attach and recover from the hyperstimulation for 2 days. Then, a protein kinase-C activator, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and adenylate cyclase activators, gonadotropins, FSH, hCG, cholera toxin, or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were added to the cells. The gonadotropins failed to increase IGFBP-1 production, whereas it was enhanced by TPA and to a lesser extent by cholera toxin and PGE2. The maximal response to TPA occurred at the concentration of 1.0 ng/mL, and the enhancing effect of TPA was detected at 24 h. PGE2 stimulated IGFBP-1 production; the lowest effective concentration was 10(-8) mol/L. The mean highest response was 4.3-fold and occurred at the PGE2 concentration of 10(-5) mol/L. The effect of PGE2 on IGFBP-1 production became detectable at 24 h, and it continued to increase up to 72 h. PGE2 also increased granulosa-luteal cell progesterone production in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into immunoreactive IGFBP-1, as detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and fluorography, was also increased by TPA. This suggests that TPA accelerated the synthesis of IGFBP-1. Our results indicate that the production of IGFBP-1 by human granulosa-luteal cells can be regulated both via protein kinase-C- and adenylate cyclase-dependent pathways.\r"

GH infusions initiated 2 h before the expected onset of sleep produced a dose-dependent inhibition of GH secretion. GH infusions (0.55 micrograms/m2/min) initiated 4 h before the stimuli inhibited the GH response to each, but did not alter the TSH response to TRH. Propranolol infusion (80 micrograms/min) started 2 h before the onset of sleep or the stimulus enhanced GH responses to GHRH and insulin alone and in the presence of GH. In contrast, propranolol neither enhanced the GH responses to arginine or sleep nor reversed the inhibitory effects of GH. The negative feedback effect of GH to both physiological and pharmacological stimuli of GH secretion indicates that it is most likely mediated by both stimulation of somatostatin and inhibition of GHRH release. The effects of beta-adrenergic blockade suggest an inhibition of somatostatin release, although the complex interaction of GH and propranolol implies that they act through dissimilar mechanisms.\r"

Parameters of pulsatile GH secretion were assessed using frequent blood sampling (every 20 or 10 min for 24 h). Acute GH responses to GHRH-44 (0.1, 0.33, and 1.0 micrograms/kg BW, iv) were measured, and GH secretion during therapy with the long-acting somatostatin analog SMS 201-995 (Sandoz) was assessed. The results were compared to those in normal volunteers. Spontaneous GH pulse frequency was greater in patients with acromegaly than in 6 control subjects (8.6 +/- 0.6 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.1 pulses/24 h), as estimated by the 20-min sampling frequency. The 10-min sampling frequency revealed 12.9 +/- 0.7 pulses/24 h in acromegalics. Spontaneous GH pulse amplitude and acute GH rises in response to GHRH did not differ between control and acromegalic subjects. A similar degree of nocturnal augmentation of GH secretion was observed in both groups, and it persisted during SMS 201-995 therapy in patients with acromegaly. These observations suggest that GH secretion in acromegaly remains under stimulatory control by GHRH, which may be released at an abnormally high rate.\r"

  ".W": "We tested for differences in aspects of mineral metabolism during the administration of diets with only vitamin D3 or only vitamin D2 in four nonhuman anthropoid primate species [two catarrhini, Macaca fascicularis (crab-eating macaque) and Macaca mulatta (rhesus macaque), and two platyrrhini, Saimiri sciureus (squirrel monkey) and Aotus vociferans (night monkey)]. All four species maintained approximately 2- to 3-fold higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level while receiving vitamin D3 than while receiving similar amounts of vitamin D2. Serum 25OHD in M. mulatta receiving the standard primate dietary supplement of vitamin D3 was high enough (360 +/- 60 vs. 70 +/- 25 nM in vitamin D-supplemented humans; P less than 0.0001) to suggest that this widely used level of vitamin D3 supplementation is excessive for some M. mulatta. Serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25-(OH)2D] in A. vociferans was uniquely high [P less than 0.01; species mean, 19 +/- 5, 95 +/- 12, and 27 +/- 5 nM in groups receiving diets with 1.5 IU vitamin D3/g, 6.6 IU vitamin D3/g, and 15 IU vitamin D2/g, respectively; mean 24,25-(OH)2D from the other three species pooled across three diets was 7 +/- 5 nM]. We confirmed relative resistance to 1,25-(OH)2D in S. sciureus, manifested by osteomalacia and moderately high serum 1,25-(OH)2D. Serum 1,25-(OH)2D in S. sciureus increased 4-fold (P less than 0.05) when the precursor in serum was changed from 250HD3 to 250HD2, suggesting that this species shows more severe resistance to 1,25-(OH)2D2 than to 1,25-(OH)2D3. In conclusion, we found many differences in vitamin D metabolism among four nonhuman anthropoid primate species. The striking feature in A. vociferans (high, 24,25-(OH)2D without high 25OHD in serum independent of whether diet contained only vitamin D3 or only vitamin D2) should allow determination of whether 24,25-(OH)2D functions as a unique agonist or an inactive metabolite in this species.\r"

  ".W": "The relation between the inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF or cachectin), which induces acute phase responses, and an established acute phase protein, C-reactive protein, was studied in various infectious and inflammatory diseases in man. All cases with very high serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (150 to 400 mg/l; normal reference value less than 10 mg/l) also had raised serum concentrations of TNF (53 to 705 ng/l; normal reference value less than 40 ng/l). In 19 out of 91 (21%) of the cases, however, a raised TNF concentration without correspondingly raised C-reactive protein concentration was also noted. Conversely, in 23 out of 106 (22%) cases raised C-reactive protein was observed in the absence of a raised TNF concentration. The ratios were high in allograft rejection and low in myocardial infarction and Kawasaki's disease. The highest mean concentration of circulating TNF was found in bacterial infections, graft rejection, and myocardial infarction. It is concluded that although high C-reactive protein concentrations are usually accompanied by raised TNF concentrations, there are pronounced relative variations in the serum concentrations of these proteins in various disease states, suggesting that there may be independent, disease specific regulatory pathways for TNF and C-reactive protein.\r"

No difference was found between treated patients and biopsied controls. There was a significant overall correlation between plasma enzyme activity and surface to volume ratio of jejunal mucosa, although two untreated patients without an overt malabsorption syndrome but with a very low surface to volume ratio had normal enzyme activity. This study shows that in coeliac disease plasma diamine oxidase activity after treatment with heparin does not always mirror the extent of the jejunal lesions, particularly in those patients with minimal or unrelated symptoms who would benefit most from a valid screening test to identify their condition.\r"

Recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was given intravenously 1 h after occlusion for clot lysis. Anatomic infarct size was measured as a percent of perfusion area and ventricular mass. Left ventricular function was assessed by ejection fraction and the centerline method. Groups 1, 3, 5 and 7 were evaluated after 24 h and received, respectively, metoprolol plus rt-PA, rt-PA, metoprolol and no treatment; groups 2, 4, 6 and 8 were studied after 1 week and treated, respectively, as groups 1, 3, 5 and 7. Metoprolol did not influence infarct size and global or regional ventricular function after 24 h and 1 week. Thrombolysis reduced infarct size from 69.5 +/- 3.4% (24 h) and 76.6 +/- 1.8% (1 week) in the control group to, respectively, 44.1 +/- 11.6% and 39.5 +/- 10.5% (p greater than 0.05), did not influence left ventricular function after 24 h and was accompanied after 1 week by a definite recovery of global and regional left ventricular function when compared with findings in control dogs.

Between FY 1976 and FY 1980, hospitalizations rose irregularly, operations declined by 37%, endoscopies tripled, physician visits fluctuated from year to year, antacid prescriptions increased by 36%, and anticholinergic medication use was stable. From FY 1981 to FY 1985, hospitalizations declined by 52%, operations by 91%, endoscopies by 45%, physician visits by 30%, antacid use by 12%, and anticholinergic medication use by 48%. H2 antagonists were allowed onto Medi-Cal formulary near the end of FY 1980, and use rose sharply through 1985. Similar results were found across specific gastrointestinal (GI) diagnoses. Total payments for acid-related conditions were essentially stable during FY 1976-1980 period, although, for individual services, utilization and expenditures did not always move in the same direction. For example, declining operations rates and stable expenditures were found. However, during FY 1981-85, changes in rates of service use were generally matched by similar changes in total expenses for that service. For example, the 40% reduction in rate of endoscopies was accompanied by a near 50% decline in payments. Overall expenditures for all acid-related diagnoses fell by nearly 28% between 1981 and 1985. We concluded that the introduction of H2 antagonists had important positive clinical effects on all studied acid-related GI diagnoses.\r"

Established antiulcer drugs like ranitidine, famotidine, sucralfate, pirenzepine, and antacids alone or in combination were unable to control ulcer pain and failed to induce ulcer healing. Initiation of omeprazole treatment at dosages to produce complete achlorhydria were necessary for ulcer healing and maintenance therapy. We suggest that (a) irradiation may cause duodenal ulcer disease indistinguishable from idiopathic duodenal ulcer; (b) radiation-induced ulcers in the duodenal bulb are refractory to various antiulcer drugs but may heal after administration of omeprazole in dosages that completely suppress acid secretion.\r"

  ".U": "90063020\r", 
  ".W": "Previous work has shown that abrogation of oral tolerance is mediated by T cells which are found in the CD3+, L3T4- (CD4-), and Lyt-2- (CD8-) subset (termed double-negative; DN) in mice. Inasmuch as it is known that athymic, nude (nu/nu) mice possess Thy 1+, CD4-, and CD8- T cells which also exhibit a functionally rearranged TCR gamma-chain, we investigated whether this subset of nude T cells contained functional immunoregulatory cells. In this report, we examined the phenotype and distribution of CD3+ T cells in the spleen and in the mesenteric and peripheral lymph nodes of BALB/c nu/nu mice in comparison with normal mice (+/+). In the spleens of nude mice, the predominant CD3+ T cell subpopulation was DN. Further, in mesenteric and peripheral lymph nodes, approximately one-third and one-half of the CD3+ T cells were double negative, respectively. In contrast, CD3+, DN T cells represent a small subpopulation in normal (+/+) mice. We next showed that functional regulatory T cells which possess the ability to abrogate oral tolerance were induced in nu/nu mice by Ag priming. BALB/c nude mice were immunized with SRBC, and the splenic CD3+, Vicia villosa-adherent cells were obtained by panning. Adoptive transfer of CD3+, V. villosa-adherent T cells to orally tolerant BALB/c mice restored responsiveness to SRBC, whereas V. villosa nonadherent cells were without effect. In other experiments, CD3+ T cells from the spleens of SRBC-primed mice were further enriched for the CD5+, DN phenotype and adoptive transfer of this subset completely abrogated oral tolerance to SRBC. To characterize the nature of the TCR expressed on these CD3+, DN T cells, we developed a rabbit antibody to a synthetic peptide (residues 209-218: Tyr-Ala-Asn-Ser-Phe-Asn-Asn-Glu-Lys-Leu) which was synthesized from a deduced sequence of the murine delta-gene. Immunoprecipitation of a cell membrane fraction from CD3+, DN T cells with anti-delta TCR antibody isolated a 45-kDa band. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of these cells with anti-CD3 (145-2C11) revealed bands at 45 and 35 kDa (corresponding to delta- and gamma-chains, respectively). Taken together, these results are the first to show that gamma delta-TCR bearing CD3+, CD4-, and CD8- T cells are functional and reverse oral tolerance when adoptively transferred.\r"

Such CTL demonstrate a requirement for the expression of class I Ag on target cells, yet appear to be unrestricted to the extent that both syngeneic and allogeneic targets precoated with hemin are sensitive to lysis. A series of CTL clones with specificity for hemin was derived from C57BL/6 mice. They exhibited the same type of promiscuous recognition that was observed in CTL populations from a number of different strains. The possibility that hemin acts as a nonspecific mediator of lysis by CTL was ruled out by the fact that a variety of CTL populations and clones specific for different Ag did not exhibit hemin-specific lysis. Some explanations offered to explain these results include 1) the possibility that hemin is recognized by binding to a site on the MHC other than the Ag-binding groove, and 2) the possibility that TCR recognition of a rigid molecule, such as hemin, may be less sensitive to polymorphic variation in the MHC than is recognition of a conventional peptide Ag whose conformation may differ significantly when bound to MHC molecules whose sequences differ within the Ag-binding groove.\r"

Suppression was observed with both primed and naive B cells, as well as with purified hapten-specific B cells, a result that suggests a direct effect of anti-CD3-activated T cells on B cell differentiation. Th1 clones activated by cognate Ag also suppressed LPS-driven antibody secretion. Furthermore, suppression of LPS-driven antibody secretion could be achieved across a cell-impermeable porous membrane when T cells were activated with anti-CD3. Suppression by Th1 clones and by normal T cells could not be attributed to a concomitant decrease in B cell proliferation or to a shift in the kinetics or isotype of the antibody response. These data demonstrate that CD4+ve Th1 clones, as well as normal T cells, can effect suppression of polyclonal antibody formation.\r"

These postrecovery suppressor cells also inhibit EAE in vivo. Fractionation of the postrecovery suppressor spleen cells on nylon wool and OX-8 coated plates yields a nylon wool-adherent CD4+ suppressor cell population that, when cocultured with effector T cells, suppresses IFN-gamma production by these effector cells. In contrast, the nylon wool-adherent, CD4+ postrecovery suppressor cell population fails to inhibit the production of IL-2 by the effector T cells. In further experiments, the effector T cell population was depleted of CD8+ cells and cocultured with the nylon wool-adherent, CD4+ postrecovery suppressor cells, and the supernatants were assayed for IFN-gamma and IL-2. IFN-gamma production was inhibited in these cultures but IL-2 production was not inhibited. Irradiated effector T cells were cocultured with CD4+ postrecovery suppressor cells, without myelin basic protein, in an effort to determine whether the mechanism of differential lymphokine suppression involved an anti-idiotypic response against effector T cells. No IL-2 was produced, indicating that there was no CD4+ suppressor cell mediated anti-idiotypic response against effector T cells. These studies suggest that the suppressor cell is a nylon wool adherent, CD4+ T cell that functions to down-regulate EAE effector T cells by differential inhibition of lymphokine production.\r"

We studied a new method of selective immunosuppression directed against activated T cells by using a chimeric recombinant protein (IL-2-PE40) composed of IL-2 fused to a modified Pseudomonas exotoxin lacking its cell recognition domain. As a model of T cell-mediated disease, we used experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) produced in Lewis rats by active immunization with the retinal S-Ag. The treatment protocol consisted of i.p. injection of IL-2-PE40 at 0.25 micrograms/g every 12 h. Controls were PBS, PE40, or IL-2-PE40asp553 a mutant form of the molecule with reduced activity. Treatment with IL-2-PE40 resulted in a significant reduction of the incidence and severity of EAU over controls. The analysis of the effect of i.p. injection of IL-2-PE40 on the popliteal draining lymph nodes of immunized animals showed a marked reduction in the lymphocytes content. Transfer experiments demonstrated that IL-2-PE40 prevented the development of EAU effector T cells. Interestingly, although activated B cells were reported to express IL-2R, there was no significant reduction of antibody production against the immunizing Ag under IL-2-PE40 treatment, suggesting sparing of the B cells.\r"

However, the frequency of Ia+ cells in replicate macrophage populations cultured for 48 h in excess concentrations of cytokine was 60 to 80% with IFN-gamma, 30 to 40% with IL-4, and 5% with medium alone. Thus, the subpopulation of macrophages able to respond to IL-4 for induction of Ia Ag expression was less than that able to respond to IFN-gamma. Expression of Ia Ag on macrophages continuously exposed to IFN-gamma was maximal at 48 h and remained at this high level through 6 days. Maximal Ia Ag expression for IL-4-treated cells was also detected at 48 h, but was not sustained with time in culture, and returned to base line by 4 days. A similar time course for levels of Ia-specific message in macrophages at various times after IFN-gamma and IL-4 treatment was detected by Northern dot blot analysis. Loss of Ia mRNA and Ag with time in culture in the IL-4 treated cells was not due to macrophage cell death, depletion of active cytokine, or presence of fluid-phase inhibitors. IL-4 unresponsive cells were fully capable of maximal response to IFN-gamma for Ia Ag induction. These findings suggest that IL-4 and IFN-gamma induce class II MHC determinants through different mechanisms which may provide discrete regulatory control of APC function.\r"

  ".W": "IL-1 gene expression was investigated in human blood mononuclear cells. IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA were induced with LPS or TNF. Kinetic measurements on Northern blots revealed that these stimuli elicited qualitatively similar changes in IL-1 mRNA levels, and that expression of IL-1 mRNA was transient. IL-1 beta mRNA was the predominant mRNA species and remained elevated for somewhat longer than IL-1 alpha mRNA. TNF and IFN-gamma synergized to induce both species of IL-1 mRNA and IL-1 bioactivity. Transcriptional control, as measured by nuclear run on assays, partly determines the greater levels of IL-1 beta mRNA because the rate of IL-1 beta transcription was greater than that of IL-1 alpha. Cycloheximide (CHX) was able to induce IL-1 mRNA but did not induce transcription of either IL-1 gene. When added to cultures pretreated with TNF or LPS, CHX superinduced IL-1 mRNA, but IL-1 transcription was not increased. If added simultaneously CHX blocked TNF-induced IL-1 gene transcription, suggesting that TNF may induce factors required for IL-1 gene transcription. CHX increased the stability of both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA, demonstrating the existence of a post-transcriptional form of control. In half-life experiments IL-1 beta mRNA was more stable than IL-1 alpha mRNA, indicating that post-transcriptional control also contributes to the greater steady state levels of IL-1 beta. Taken together, the available evidence suggests IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA are regulated differentially at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level.\r"

In the course of studies to determine its effect on human bone marrow cells, we noted a marked outgrowth of mature T cells. When T cells from the circulation were cultured with IL-7, a dose-dependent proliferative response was observed. The target cells included both the CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations of T cells, but the memory T cells (CD45R-) were better responders than unprimed T cells (CD45R+). IL-7 induced the expression of receptors for IL-2 and transferrin and higher levels of the 4F2 activation Ag. Although T cell responses to suboptimal concentrations of IL-7 were enhanced by the addition of IL-2, the proliferative response to IL-7 was not inhibited by neutralizing antibody to the IL-2R (Tac), nor was IL-2 secretion detected in this response. This response pattern of mature T cells suggests an important role for IL-7 in normal T cell physiology in humans.\r"

This protein was selected for study because of preliminary observations that sera from autoimmune mice bound unexpectedly to cloned fusion protein constructions containing beta-gal. Using ELISA assays, sera from MRL-lpr/lpr mice demonstrated high levels of antibodies to both DNA and beta-gal, in titers significantly greater than those of BALB/c controls. Affinity chromatography using beta-gal-Sepharose demonstrated that antibodies enriched for anti-beta-gal activity bound both DNA as well as beta-gal, indicating the presence of a population of cross-reactive anti-DNA antibodies. Furthermore, anti-DNA mAb of MRL-lpr/lpr strain origin also bound beta-gal by ELISA, although these levels were lower than those to DNA. Together, these results extend the range of polyspecific binding of murine anti-DNA antibodies to bacterial proteins. They further suggest caution in the interpretation of immunoassays using fusion protein constructions containing beta-gal, especially with sera from autoimmune mice.\r"

Lamin B autoantibodies in this individual's serum were almost entirely IgG1 lambda at the onset of the autoimmune response. There was no evidence of IgM to IgG class switching, and no apparent diversification of the autoantibody response over the next 2 yr. The kappa/lambda L chain ratio of the lamin B autoantibodies was 0.13 by ELISA, with a kappa/lambda ratio of 0.70 for the patient's total IgG. In contrast, anti-histone autoantibodies in the patient's serum contained primarily kappa L chain. The kappa/lambda L chain ratios of lamin B autoantibodies from sera of four other patients with SLE were also consistent with restricted heterogeneity of lamin autoantibodies. In two, lambda L chain predominated, and in two others, the lamin B autoantibodies contained predominantly kappa L chains. The restricted heterogeneity of lamin B autoantibodies could be related to targeting of a single immunodominant autoepitope, to the existence of a particular L chain gene or genes that preferentially undergo somatic mutation, leading to the production of lamin B reactive clones, or to a combination of both mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "90063054\r", 
  ".W": "The catalytic subunit of cholera toxin (CT) can chemically modify the alpha polypeptides of certain G-binding proteins and thus alter their function. In order to study the involvement of CT-sensitive G proteins in T cell activation, we have utilized CT in an in vitro system in which purified, resting human peripheral T cells are activated by anti-CD3 antibodies and rIL-2. Perturbation of the TCR/CD3 molecular complex by anti-CD3 antibodies causes changes in membrane phospholipids and induces a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+. These events, however, are insufficient to allow progression into cellular proliferation and addition of IL-2 is required. Under these conditions, treatment of cells with a low concentration of CT (2 ng/ml) causes a significant inhibition of the anti-CD3-induced calcium event as well as the anti-CD3 plus IL-2-stimulated proliferation. Under our experimental conditions, inhibition of both proliferation and intracellular Ca2+ elevation by CT requires the involvement of the TCR/CD3 complex. This is supported by the observation that the toxin does not inhibit either the proliferation triggered by ionomycin and PMA or the Ca2+ influx induced by the ionophore. These data suggest that in TCR/CD3-mediated T cell activation CT acts at a point between TCR/CD3 perturbation and the generation of intracellular Ca2+. In view of the ability of CT to activate the alpha subunit of the G protein that stimulates adenyl cyclase (G alpha s), it is possible that the effect of CT on T cells is secondary to intracellular elevation of cAMP. However, measurement of cAMP levels both early after CT addition and at later time points, when proliferation is maximal, reveals lack of cyclic nucleotide accumulation. The presented data are consistent with the interpretation that the CT-mediated inhibition is caused by the modification of a G-binding protein that is either directly or indirectly associated with triggering of T cells via the TCR/CD3 molecular complex. The data also suggest that this protein is not G alpha s and it probably represents an as yet unidentified moiety or one of the several G proteins that have been recently described as regulators of phospholipase C activation.\r"

However, in an isolated cell suspension the majority of synthesized PAF appears to remain cell associated. In addition, LTB4 is rapidly metabolized to an omega-oxidation product (20-OH-LTB4). Experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that the degree of association of PAF with the neutrophils and the metabolism of LTB4 by the neutrophils is a result of the in vitro condition used during cell activation. Here we have compared in paired experiments ionophore A23187-induced production of PAF and LTB4 by human neutrophils in a concentrated cell suspension, a diluted cell suspension and in a system in which the cells are placed on a matrix and superfused with buffer at a constant flow rate (dynamic system). There was little difference in the amount of PAF synthesized in the concentrated cell suspension and the dynamic system. However, less PAF was produced by neutrophils in the dilution system. The percent of PAF released was consistently greater in the dynamic and dilution systems than in the concentrated cell suspension. For example, more than 40% of PAF measured by incorporation of [3H]acetate or gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was released in the dynamic system and dilution systems. In contrast, less than 15% of the PAF synthesized was released from the cells in the concentrated cell suspension. 1-0-Hexadecyl-2-acetyl-3-GPC was primarily released from the neutrophils. By contrast both 1-0-hexadecyl and 1-0-octadecyl linked species of PAF were found within the cells. Exogenous PAF added to neutrophils in the dynamic or dilution systems was taken up and metabolized at a significantly lower rate than that added to cells in the concentrated cell suspension. Most of the leukotrienes synthesized by the neutrophil during A23187 stimulation were released from the cells. However, studies of LTB4 metabolism revealed differences between the dynamic and concentrated cell suspension designs. By 20 min, most of the LTB4 was recovered as 20-OH-LTB4 in the concentrated cell suspension, whereas in the dynamic system little 20-OH-LTB4 was found in the superfusate over 20 min. These experiments suggest that a large proportion of PAF synthesized by neutrophils may be released. They also suggest that the omega-hydroxylation of LTB4 by neutrophils occurs after synthesized LTB4 is released and taken back up by the cell.\r"

In an in vitro microtiter adherence assay, LPS in concentrations of 10 ng/ml to 10 micrograms/ml incubated for 20 to 60 min with human monocytes significantly stimulated monocyte adherence to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers (HUVEC) and serum-coated plastic surfaces. The time course and concentration dependence of LPS-stimulated monocyte adherence to glutaraldehyde-fixed HUVEC did not differ significantly from that to unfixed HUVEC or serum-coated plastic surfaces. Pretreatment studies suggested that LPS acted on the monocyte within 25 min to stimulate adherence to untreated endothelial cells but required a minimum of 1.5 to 2 h to render the endothelial cell more adhesive for untreated monocytes. The potential role of TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, and IL-1 beta in this system was assessed by determining the ability of these cytokines (+/- cytokine antibodies) to increase monocyte adherence. TNF, but neither IL-1, stimulated early monocyte adherence (1 h). This TNF-stimulated monocyte adherence was abrogated by coincubation with anti-rTNF-alpha polyclonal antibody. However, the anti-rTNF antibody had no effect on LPS-induced monocyte adherence to endothelial cells or serum-coated plastic surfaces. An early action of LPS on the monocyte to induce adherence to endothelial cell surfaces may contribute to the initial localization of peripheral blood monocytes in tissues during endotoxemia. The later effects of LPS on the endothelial cell to stimulate monocyte adherence may then amplify these initial monocyte-endothelial cell interactions to prolong and intensify monocyte adherence prior to migration into tissues.\r"

In contrast, the adoptive transfer of immunity by unseparated immune lymphocytes has been reported to be MHC-restricted. To address the restriction properties of CD8 effectors in vivo, we assessed their efficacy in protecting syngeneic and allogeneic recipients. Protection was determined by comparing the number of viable splenic Listeria in naive mice and in recipients of 60 million CD8-enriched, L3T4-depleted, Listeria-immune spleen cells, 2 days after the infusion of 10,000 Listeria. Donor cells from B6 (H-2b) mice transferred about 4 logs of protection in syngeneic recipients and more than 2 logs in allogeneic B10.A (H-2a) or B10.BR (H-2k) mice. Immune B10.A CD8 cells transferred equivalent protection to B6 mice. Protection was almost completely abrogated by the lysis or lethal irradiation of CD8 cells before transfer in vivo. On the other hand, the depletion of macrophages or NK cells did not impair adoptive transfer. By comparison, nonimmune CD8 cells from normal mice or from mice stimulated with an irrelevant Ag in vivo did not transfer substantial immunity to allogeneic recipients. We have noted previously that protective CD8 cells inhibit phagocyte accumulation in the spleen of Listeria-infected syngeneic recipients. In the present studies, we observed similar changes in adoptively immunized allogeneic mice. Reduced phagocyte accumulation may reflect Listeria-dependent lysis of infected phagocytes by immune CD8 cells. In support of this, we showed that Listeria-immune donor cells rapidly acquired the capacity to mediate Listeria-dependent, MHC-unrestricted lysis of macrophages after incubation with small amounts of IL-2 in vitro. In sum, our data establish that Listeria-immune CD8 cells can function in vivo in MHC incompatible hosts, and indirectly support the hypothesis that the destruction of infected phagocytes may be important in T cell-mediated immunity against Listeria and perhaps other intracellular pathogens.\r"

The effector cells were CTL of the CD5+ CD8+ phenotype and showed restriction of MHC class I Ag. Direct tests as well as cold target cell inhibition tests with an array of cell populations showed that these CTL reacted only with syngeneic HTLV-1+ cell lines. When xenogeneic HTLV-1+ cell lines were similarly utilized for in vitro sensitization, rat CTL specific for syngeneic HTLV-1+ cells were generated. They were not, however, reactive with xenogeneic HTLV-1+ cells used for sensitization. Syngeneic rat cells selectively expressing gag, env, or pX gene coded Ag were prepared by infection of recombinant vaccinia viruses. In cold target cell inhibition tests of anti-HTLV-1 CTL with thus prepared cells, cytotoxicity against the syngeneic HTLV-1+ cells line, TARS-1, was inhibited by syngeneic cells expressing gag gene or env gene coded Ag. Inhibition was, however, more consistent and more dominant by cells with gag gene than those with env gene. Syngeneic cells with pX gene and MHC class I incompatible cells with gag, env, or pX gene did not inhibit cytotoxicity.\r"

Here we demonstrate the role of the intact I-A and I-E molecules as well as the individual A alpha and E alpha chains in the deletion of cells bearing the V beta 6 TCR. DBA/1 (H-2q, Mls-1a) mice were crossed with various inbred congenic, recombinant, and transgenic strains and the F1's were screened for V beta 6 expression. All I-E+ strains were fully permissive in deleting V beta 6+ T cells. I-E- strains expressing I-A b,f,s,k,p permitted only partial deletion, while I-Aq strains showed no deletion. Recombinant I-Aq and I-Af strains which expressed E kappa alpha chain in the absence of E beta chain showed a decrease in V beta 6+ T cells as compared to their H-2q and H-2f counterparts. Furthermore, transgenic mice expressing E kappa alpha Aq beta gene in an H-2q haplotype (E kappa alpha Aq beta?) gave similar results to that of the recombinants in deleting V beta 6 T-cells. The role of the 1-A molecule was also shown by the partial deletion of V beta 6+ T cells in H-2q mice expressing transgenic I-Ak molecules. These results demonstrate that the E alpha chain is important in the deletion of V beta 6 T-cells in Mls-1a mice. The role of A alpha chain is also implied by the permissiveness of E kappa alpha Aq beta but not Aq alpha Aq beta molecules in the deletion of V beta 6+ T cells.\r"

Recent evidence from several laboratories demonstrates that mRNA levels for class II genes reflect levels of surface expression. We have investigated the effects of agents that regulate Ia expression, either positively as IFN-gamma or negatively as bacterial LPS or maleylated proteins, on transcription of these genes. By using probes for I-A beta and I-E beta as representative class II MHC genes, we found that IFN-gamma induces transcription in murine peritoneal macrophages of I-A beta and of I-E beta as determined in nuclear run-on assays. The measured transcription peaked 6 to 10 h after administration of IFN-gamma to the macrophages. This augmented expression of transcription was markedly suppressed by administration of either LPS or maleylated protein to the macrophages. Collectively, the data indicate that regulation of transcription by either positive or negative stimuli, acting through surface receptors and binding sites, is a major mechanism for controlling the expression of class II MHC molecules in macrophages.\r"

PC-specific hybridomas derived from bone marrow cells of aged mice utilize members of at least three VH gene segment families that have never been observed in PC responses of young mice.

  ".W": "Proteins encoded by the early region 1A (E1A) regulate transcription of viral and cellular genes. The mechanism of this trans-regulation remains unclear but it is of considerable interest as an example of transcription regulation through cellular intermediates. We have therefore studied the effect of E1A products on the activity of the k-L chain gene enhancer. In our previous studies we have found that the k-chain enhancer is activated by E1A products in fibroblasts. Using in vivo competition experiments we found that the E1A regulatory effect involves trans-acting factors that can be titrated out by the k-chain enhancer sequences. Our transfection experiments suggest that the k3 enhancer fragment, encompassing the NF-kB binding site, is one of the sites through which the adenovirus E1A products exert their transactivation effect. The level of the nuclear factors that bind to the NF-kB binding site increases in fibroblasts that constitutively express E1A products. Understanding the mechanisms through which E1A regulates transcription should help to illuminate cellular mechanisms of gene control in normal and transformed cells.\r"

In this study, we have analysed the serum protein, the alpha-HCD mRNA and the rearranged alpha-HCD gene from the leukemic cells of a patient (MAL) with alpha-HCD. The abnormal MAL serum Ig consisted of short alpha 1-chains, lacking VH and CH1 domains (only CH2 and CH3 domains were present). The alpha-HCD mRNA (1.2 kb) was shorter than a normal alpha-mRNA (2 kb); the corresponding cDNA had sequences for the leader, a 84-bp sequence of unknown origin and the CH2 and CH3 exons. The establishment of the sequence of the productive alpha-HCD MAL allele revealed two major deletions; that of the VH region as well as that of the CH1 region. The JH region is altered by multiple mutations, small insertions and a duplication of the psi JH3 region. A large insert (INS1), of 360 bp (containing the 84 bp exon found in the cDNA), replaces the deleted VH region. INS1 is non-Ig related and apparently of nongenomic origin. A large second insert (509 bp), is located between the enhancer and the switch region. Insert2 contains repetitive non-Ig-related sequences and a small Ig-related sequence. All these alterations resulted in an abnormal mRNA, which comprises the leader, a 84-bp alien exon derived from INS1 and the CH2 and CH3 exons of the alpha 1-gene.\r"

  ".W": "The growth of cultured human keratinocytes (KC) is inhibited by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), cyclosporin A and transforming growth factor-beta, but not by tumor necrosis factor. When these antiproliferative molecules were added to KC they induced a concentration and time-dependent inhibition of 125I-epidermal growth factor (I-EGF) binding. These anti-proliferative molecules primarily reduced the number of binding sites by approximately 25%-50% without affecting the binding affinity. Tumor necrosis factor did not influence the ligand binding by I-EGF. In parallel with the ability of the antiproliferative molecules to inhibit I-EGF binding, there was an increase in transforming growth factor-alpha production. These results suggest that several different antiproliferative molecules may share a common mechanism to inhibit cell growth by reducing I-EGF binding to KC.\r"

When strains containing protein IA in their outer membranes and having auxotypes other than the arginine-hypoxanthine-uracil requirement were serotyped, a significant difference was found in the distribution of serovars among strains from DGI and suspected DGI compared with UG. The two typing systems revealed both antigenic similarities and differences of gonococci from Chicago and isolates from Germany reported in another study. Like DGI strains, most suspected DGI strains contained protein IA and were resistant to the bactericidal action of serum.\r"

Using serotyping and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, we identified 63 genetically distinctive strains; four prevalent strains accounted for 21% of isolates. Only 5 of 33 nosocomial acquisitions were due to horizontal transmission. Nine acquisitions were linked to environmental sources (e.g., sink surfaces), which often harbored antibiotic-resistant strains but posed a risk only to oncology patients. Although significant Pseudomonas infections occurred in only 11% of colonized patients, 63% of colonized severely neutropenic patients--predominantly those who had acquired the prevalent, often environmentally linked strains--developed infections. Thus, P. aeruginosa was a significant pathogen in oncology patients; typing by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis allowed the detection of important environmental sources.\r"

It is indeed possible reliably to reduce the size of the subglottic haemangioma, and thus to avoid a lengthy period of intensive care, as well as the problems of prolonged intubation or tracheostomy for drainage, while also avoiding long term steroid therapy. This approach in no way affects the spontaneous evolution of subglottic haemangioma in the infant; there is a tendency for the haemangioma to regress after the age of one year. The treatment does, however, permit a considerable improvement in the comfort of the infant's life during this difficult period between 3 and 12 months. We illustrate this new attitude by presenting a report on four cases.\r"

To determine if the routine urinalysis might be economically beneficial, we evaluated its cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit. In the setting of elective clean-wound, non-prosthetic knee procedures, we estimated that: (1) nearly U.S. $7,000,000 is spent annually on preoperative urinalyses and associated costs; (2) given the best estimate of the increase in risk of wound infection attributable to urinary tract infection, 4.58 wound infections may be prevented annually, at a cost of $1,500,000 per wound infection prevented; (3) the cost of treating additional cases of wound infection, given no preoperative urinalysis, is approximately five hundred-fold less than the cost of screening with routine urinalyses. We conclude that the routine preoperative urinalysis is clinically and economically unsound before clean-wound, non-prosthetic knee surgery and probably before other types of clean-wound surgery. For this relatively inexpensive test, aggregate costs are disproportionately high and appear to outweight clinical benefits.\r"

Twenty-nine women were enrolled on study; 16 patients had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy and no patient had received chemotherapy for stage IV disease. Two patients were found to be ineligible and excluded from further analysis. Of the 27 patients treated, four (15%) obtained a CR and 15 (56%) a partial response (PR) after LOMAC induction, for an overall response rate of 70%. Of the 22 patients treated with ICT, 12 patients had a CR, and nine were in PR after induction and converted to CR after ICT. The toxicities included nausea/vomiting, mucositis, diarrhea, dermatitis, alopecia, and infections secondary to neutropenia. The 1-year survival is 60%; the median has not yet been reached. The time to treatment failure for patients on study is 10 months. The treatment approach of ICT and ASCR following induction chemotherapy can lead to an improved CR rate in stage IV breast cancer. How this increased CR rate leads to a prolonged disease-free survival requires further follow-up.\r"

Twenty-two RCC patients with disease progression subsequent to nephrectomy were entered on a phase II clinical trial. During an initial dose-finding phase, biochemical responses to repeated once-weekly subcutaneous injections of 10, 100, or 500 micrograms of recombinant IFN-gamma were tested in 16 patients. Results indicated that 100 micrograms IFN-gamma applied once weekly was biologically active with induction of serum beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin. Such a dose induced a nearly maximum response of both markers lasting more than 4 days. This dose was also associated with minimal side effects. A dose of 100 micrograms IFN-gamma given once weekly was, therefore, subsequently given weekly for long-term treatment. During a median time of therapy of 10 months (range, 2 to 32 months) two complete (CR; 20+, 20+ months) and four partial tumor responses (PR; 6+, 7+, 8+, 24+ months) were seen (30% CR plus PR; 95% confidence limits, 12% to 54%) among 20 patients evaluable for response.

  ".U": "90063776\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic cerebral vasospasm was induced in 16 monkeys by direct placement of a clot of autologous blood over the arteries of the circle of Willis on the right side. The middle cerebral arteries (MCA's) on the clot side all showed angiographic vasospasm, which was maximal 7 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Animals were sacrificed at this time and vascular responses to acetylcholine (ACh), histamine, and the calcium ionophore A23187 were studied in MCA rings from the clot (spastic) side and the non-clot (control) side. In control preparations with an intact endothelium, which had been precontracted by prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), histamine and A23187 produced significant relaxation. The same concentrations of histamine and A23187 did not relax vascular tissues in which the endothelium had been mechanically removed. Acetylcholine did not produce a significant endothelium-dependent relaxation of primate MCA rings, but did relax rings of primate common carotid artery. Pretreatment with chlorpheniramine (an H1-receptor antagonist) prevented histamine-induced relaxation; however, cimetidine (an H2-receptor antagonist) had no inhibitory action. It thus seems that histamine mediates relaxation of intact MCA's mostly by an H1-receptor-mediated release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Relaxations induced by histamine and A23187 in MCA's from the clot side were substantially reduced. Moreover, the small component of ACh-induced relaxation was also abolished. Endothelium-independent relaxation induced by glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) occurred in arteries from both the control and the clot sides. Constrictions induced by KC1 and PGF2 alpha were reduced on the clot side of the MCA's. These results suggest that subarachnoid hemorrhage influences both the generation of EDRF and the constriction of affected arteries. The small contraction which was elicited in spastic arteries was fully relaxed by GTN.\r"

However, as nutrients are fed at higher dietary concentrations, responses become inhibited and diminish from their usual plateaus. By adding an inhibition constant (Ks) to the SKM in a manner consistent with substrate inhibition (based on enzyme kinetics), it becomes possible to predict the inhibited portions of the nutrient-response curve. To test this, rats were fed diets of graded levels of casein (0-75%) or lysine (0-6.2%), and weight gains and food intakes were measured daily for up to 2 wk. The inhibition form of the SKM was able to predict the complete response range of each experiment, producing a Ks (weight gain) at a dietary level of 50.60% for casein and 7.56% for lysine. It was also possible to set up an upper and lower dietary nutrient concentration that encompassed the 100% response range for each response, thereby giving an inhibition or toxicity index of 2.02 for casein and 4.98 for lysine. This index allows one to set nutritional requirement levels precisely, optimizing responses without moving into inhibiting or toxic ranges of nutrients. Based on growth response curves, requirements were 25.61% for casein and 1.97% for lysine.\r"

Additional groups of rats were either injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with large doses of nicotinamide (NAM) or saline or fed the MCD diet without folic acid (MCFD). As a positive control, some rats were fed the MCD diet supplemented with methionine and choline (MCD + Met). In all groups of methyl donor-deficient rats and associated with increases in hepatic lipid levels, hepatic malondialdehyde concentrations were found to be increased. This observation is evidence for the occurrence of lipid peroxidation in methyl donor deficiency. Methyl donor deficiency was also associated with a significantly elevated hepatic poly(ADP ribose) polymerase activity in all groups of rats as compared to the positive control, suggesting a stimulation of DNA repair processes. The highest enzyme activity was observed in the MCD-NAM i.p. group.\r"

In a paired design, two isoproteinic (2.4 +/- 0.2 gm/kg/day) and isocaloric (64 +/- 6 kcal/kg/day) regimens differing by source of energy (high glucose vs high lipid) were infused on consecutive days. Environmental and body temperatures were recorded during a 4-hour period, and 24-hour urinary excretions of catecholamines, nitrogen, and C peptide were measured. Despite constant incubator and average skin temperatures, the rectal and interscapular temperatures rose significantly when the high-glucose regimen was changed to a high-lipid regimen. The specific locations of these changes in body temperature suggested brown fat activation. A significant drop in nitrogen retention (63 +/- 9% vs 56 +/- 10%) during the lipid infusion could be further evidence of a metabolic adaptation to the rapid change in energy substrates.\r"

Translational initiation and termination codons were introduced by the PCR at points corresponding to sites of cleavage of the RT from the gag-pol precursor polyprotein by the HIV-1 protease; the HIV-1 protease is not expressed from this construct. Most of the RT coding sequences derived from PCR were exchanged for a DNA fragment cloned by standard methods to minimize the possibility that an unwanted mutation was introduced during the in vitro amplification. The RT is expressed in bacteria from this plasmid as 66 and 51 kDa proteins, has both RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities, and is indistinguishable from native HIV-1 RT in electrophoretic mobility and immunoreactivity. Peptide sequencing of the amino terminus of the HIV-1 RT purified from bacterial lysates is also presented. A novel activity gel assay was used to confirm that only the 66 kd protein catalyzes the RNase H reaction; this assay will simplify analysis of this catalytic activity. This HIV-1 RT expression plasmid is of interest because of the high level of expression in bacteria and the demonstrated RNase H activity of the enzyme. This plasmid will be distributed for research purposes through the NIH AIDS Repository and will facilitate enzymologic, structural, and immunologic evaluation of reverse transcription and its chemotherapeutic inhibition.\r"

For this evaluation, we tested the effects of CGT and HPR given alone or combined in the diet on the growth of established 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced rat mammary tumors. When given alone, optimal doses of CGT (128.0 mmol/kg in the diet) or HPR (2.0 mmol/kg in the diet) administered daily for 25 days reduced mammary tumor sizes by approximately 15% or 20%, respectively. Suboptimal doses of CGT (64.0 mmol/kg) or HPR (0.75 mmol/kg) administered daily for 25 days only slightly inhibited tumor growth; over the 25-day period, the tumor sizes in rats on the CGT diet and in rats on the HPR diet increased by 55% and 70%, respectively, compared with a 98% increase in tumor sizes in the rats on the control diet. In contrast, the combination of suboptimal doses of CGT (64.0 mmol/kg) and HPR (0.75 mmol/kg) administered daily for 25 days decreased tumor sizes by 33%. These results are statistically significant. They show that CGT and HPR act synergistically. Consequently, lower concentrations of these agents can be used to inhibit mammary tumor development and growth.\r"

Preoperative evaluation included a computerized tomography scan in all patients and magnetic resonance imaging in 4. Magnetic resonance imaging offered better resolution and anatomical definition in certain cases. Preoperative computerized tomography-guided needle biopsy, performed in 3 patients, yielded inaccurate or inconclusive results. The 6 patients with surgically resected benign schwannomas and neurofibromas had no local recurrences and all 6 had no evidence of disease (mean followup 17.3 and 14 months, respectively). Malignant tumors, especially when associated with von Recklinghausen's disease, offered a poor prognosis. Surgical considerations include complete tumor excision with free margins of resection and proper pathological evaluation to determine biological potential.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine the role of immediate intravesical instillation of single dose thiotepa post transurethral resection of bladder tumor in the prevention of recurrence by tumor implantation, using murine bladder tumor line 2 and 201 C3H/He mice. Previous studies have suggested implantation may take place as early as the first hour and reach its maximum in 24 hours after resection of bladder tumor. An in vitro dose response curve of MBT2 to thiotepa was established by treatment with various concentrations of thiotepa of 0.00, 0.01, 0.21, 0.44, and 1.91 mg./ml. In a group of 201 mice, the bladder was catheterized with a 24G angiocatheter, and a fine copper wire was inserted through the lumen. The bladder was cauterized by touching the wire with a Bovie coagulator for four seconds at the lowest setting. All bladders were instilled with 1 x 10(6) cells of murine bladder tumor line 2, followed by instillation of 1.91 mg./ml. of thiotepa with various time delays per treatment group. The bladder implantation rates were 30.4% (17/56), 3.4% (2/59), 6.5% (2/31) and 26.9% (7/26) in the control, immediate, one-hour delay and 24-hour delay groups, respectively. The urethral implantation rates were 21.4% (12/56), 0% (0/59), 6.5% (2/31) and 0% (2/26), respectively. The overall implantation rates (bladder, urethra, or both) were 42.9% (24/56), 3.4% (2/59), 6.5% (2/31) and 25.9% (7/27), respectively. Implantation rates were significantly higher in the control and 24-hour delay groups than in the immediate and one-hour instillation groups (p less than 0.05, Fisher Exact Test). We conclude from this animal model that intravesical instillation of single dose thiotepa, to be effective, should be initiated within the first hour after tumor resection, since it dramatically decreased the incidence of bladder and urethral implantation.\r"

We measured the loss of indium 111 from freshly harvested, canine, venous endothelial cells, and their viability in cell culture, for varying intervals up to 24 hours. At prescribed intervals, aliquots of the radiolabeled endothelial cell suspension were centrifuged, and the supernatant was separated from the cell pellet. The relative radioactivity of each was measured in a gamma well counter and the spontaneous loss of marker from the endothelial cells was calculated. Spontaneous loss of indium 111 was 7.8% +/- 1.9% at 1 hour and 47.6% +/- 1.8% at 24 hours. Loss of activity was virtually constant between 14 and 24 hours. Endothelial cell viability was 80% at 24 hours. We next studied the in vitro affinity of indium 111 oxine and indium 111 transferrin for untreated expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts and for similar grafts treated with two surfactants commonly used to increase the \"wetability\" of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, a nonionic sufectant (Nonidet) and tridodecylmethylammonium chloride, and with two glycoproteins, fibronectin and basement membrane gel. A minimum of three graft segments were studied in each group. The affinity of graft material for indium 111, in both its oxine and transferrin complex, was significantly increased by treating the graft with a wetting agent, and it was further increased by the addition of a glycoprotein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Samples were taken from patients and their nurse attendants to identify their indigenous flora. Cultures were also done of swabs from the catheter insertion site, blood, nutrient solution, segment of the catheter, and washings of the catheter hub. Intravascular segment colonisation was commoner in group A (18/58) than in group B patients (4/51), and bacterial migration from insertion site to intravascular segment was also commoner among group A (9/58) than among group B patients (1/51). Catheter hub contamination was responsible in 10 out of 22 cases of microbial colonisation; in 6 of these 10 the bacterium isolated was present on the skin of nurses who changed the bag. Contamination of the insertion site skin and of the CVC hub were equally responsible for the microbial colonisation of the intravenous segment of the catheter.\r"

The disease is growing most rapidly among intravenous drug abusers and minority patients. This accentuates some medical and ethical problems. Chief among these are the availability of competent care for patients and the willingness of physicians to treat these patients, issues related to HIV testing and counseling, patients' rights regarding the extent of treatment that should be given and access to and participation in clinical trials.\r"

  ".U": "90066613\r", 
  ".W": "To determine which markers of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) replication correlate most closely with progressive disease, we compared the following: (1) the frequency of isolation of HIV from peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), (2) the frequency of isolation of the virus from cell-free plasma (plasma viremia), (3) the presence and titer of p24 antigen in plasma, and (4) the presence and titer of antibody to p24 antigen. We studied 213 persons who were positive for HIV antibody and 71 who were negative. HIV was isolated from PBMC from 207 of the 213 antibody-positive patients (97 percent), regardless of the clinical stage of the infection. Plasma viremia, in contrast, was correlated with the clinical stage of the infection. It was detected in 11 of 48 patients (23 percent) with asymptomatic infection, 32 of 71 (45 percent) in Class IVa of the Centers for Disease Control (those with AIDS-related complex), and 75 of 92 (82 percent) in Class IVc (those with AIDS) (P less than 0.01). Plasma HIV titers ranged from 10(0) to 10(4.3) and rose from a mean of 10(1.4) in asymptomatic patients to 10(2.5) in those with AIDS (P less than 0.02). Only 45 percent of patients with plasma viremia had HIV p24 antigen in either serum or plasma, and no correlation was found between the amount of p24 antigen in plasma and the plasma HIV titers. Follow-up tests indicated that plasma viremia was associated with a more marked decline in the CD4-lymphocyte cell count and the development of symptomatic disease (P = 0.034). We conclude that plasma viremia is a more sensitive virologic marker of the clinical stage of HIV infection and viral replication than the presence of p24 antigen or antibody in plasma. Not only whole blood but cell-free plasma from HIV-infected patients should be considered potentially infectious.\r"

  ".U": "90066673\r", 
  ".W": "The discovery that Ca2+ is necessary for the release of neurotransmitter, the primary means by which nerve cells communicate, led to the calcium hypothesis of neutransmitter release, in which release is initiated after an action potential only by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration near the release sites and is terminated (1-2 ms) by the rapid removal of Ca2+. Since then, the calcium-voltage hypothesis has been proposed, in which the depolarization of the presynaptic terminals has two functions. First, in common with the calcium hypothesis, the Ca2+ conductance is increased, thereby permitting Ca2+ entry. Second, a conformational change is induced in a membrane molecule that renders it sensitive to Ca2+, and then binding of Ca2+ to this active form triggers release of neurotransmitter. When the membrane is repolarized, the molecule is inactivated and release is terminated, regardless of the local Ca2+ concentration at that moment. This hypothesis, in contrast to the calcium hypothesis, accounts for the insensitivity of the time course of release to experimental manipulations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Furthermore, it explains rapid termination of release after depolarization, even though Ca2+ concentration may still be high. Here we describe experiments that distinguish between these two hypotheses and find that our results support the calcium voltage hypothesis.\r"

  ".W": "Lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid have recently been shown to modulate the activity of ion channels in nerve and muscle cells. The mechanism of action of these metabolites is, however, unknown. In sensory neurons of Aplysia, the S-K- channel is under the dual modulatory control of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), which decreases the number of active S channels through cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation, and the neuropeptide FMRFamide, which increases the probability of S-channel opening through the 12-lipoxygenase metabolite 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE). Here we report that the increase in the probability of S-channel opening with FMRFamide is mimicked by application of 12-HPETE to cell-free membrane patches that lack ATP and GTP. Thus, 12-HPETE can act directly to modulate S-channel activity, independently of protein phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, G-protein activation or cyclic nucleotides.\r"

The precise mechanism by which tolerance is induced and the stage of T-cell development at which it occurs are not known. We have now studied T-cell tolerance in transgenic mice expressing a T-cell receptor with double specificities for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-H-2Db and for the mixed-lymphocyte stimulatory (MIsa) antigen. We report that alpha beta TCR transgenic mice tolerant to LCMV have drastically reduced numbers of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and of peripheral T cells carrying the CD8 antigen. By contrast, tolerance to MIsa antigen in the same alpha beta TCR transgenic MIsa mice leads to deletion of only mature thymocytes and peripheral T cells and does not affect CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Thus the same transgenic TCR-expressing T cells may be tolerized at different stages of their maturation and at different locations in the thymus depending on the antigen involved.\r"

Mice expressing I-E with the normal tissue distribution (on B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and thymic epithelium) induce tolerance to self I-E by clonal deletion in the thymus. By contrast, we find that transgenic INS-I-E mice that express I-E on pancreatic beta-cells, but not in the thymus or peripheral lymphoid organs, are tolerant to I-E but have not deleted V beta 5- and V beta 17a-bearing T cells. Moreover, whereas T-cell populations from nontransgenic mice proliferate in response to receptor crosslinking with V beta 5- and V beta 17a-specific antibodies, T cells from INS-I-E mice do not. Thus, our experiments provide direct evidence that T-cell tolerance by clonal paralysis does occur during normal T-cell development in vivo.\r"

The experimental (E) group had nasojejunal feeding tubes placed fluoroscopically. Within 36 hours of injury, they received nutritional support equal to their measured resting energy expenditure. The control (C) group was fed gastrically when bowel sounds returned. There were no significant differences (P greater than 0.05) in age, Glasgow Coma Scale score, type of neurological injury, or associated injuries between the two groups. The mean resting energy expenditure, serum albumin, glucose, lymphocyte count, body weight, and total nitrogen loss were nearly identical for both groups. With the jejunal feedings, daily caloric (E = 2102 kcal versus C = 1100 kcal) and nitrogen intake (E = 11.1 g versus C = 5.6 g) and daily nitrogen balance (E = -4.3 g versus C = -11.8 g) improved. The incidence of bacterial infections (E = 3 versus C = 14) and days of intensive care unit hospitalization (E = 6 versus C = 10) were significantly reduced (P less than .05). Head-injured patients will tolerate early jejunal hyperalimentation despite the presence of a clinically silent abdomen, and the cost and complications of total parenteral nutrition are avoided. The increased caloric and nitrogen intake and improved nitrogen retention markedly reduced infections and days of stay in the intensive care unit.\r"

After vessels developed spontaneous tone, increasing concentrations of mannitol were applied extraluminally. Mannitol induced vasodilation in a dose-dependent manner. In an initial series of vessels, a 2% mannitol solution produced a maximal increase of vessel diameter of 35.8 +/- 2.2% (mean +/- SEM; n = 5). The degree of vasodilation was comparable to that produced by a sucrose solution of nearly equal osmolarity, suggesting that mannitol produced nonspecific vasodilation by increasing osmolarity. Organ bath solution pH was varied to 6.8 and 7.6 from the control pH of 7.3 in order to examine the effects of mannitol on vessels with different degrees of vessel tone. The mannitol dose-response curves in these vessels were parallel to each other, indicating that vasodilating effects of mannitol are essentially constant irrespective of the initial tone state of the vessel. In a second series of experiments, the effects of intraluminally applied mannitol on intracerebral arterioles were examined and compared to extraluminal application. Intraluminal application of 2% mannitol solutions produced a 42.6 +/- 2.0% (n = 5) increase in vessel diameter, which was not significantly different from that produced by extraluminal application (42.5 +/- 2.9%; n = 5; p = 0.89). Our results indicate that the direct action of mannitol on vascular smooth muscle in intracerebral arterioles is vasodilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate the hypothesis that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is related to the natriuresis in SIADH, serum samples were obtained from 8 neurosurgical patients with intracranial disease seen consecutively who fulfilled the traditional clinical and laboratory criteria for SIADH. In one patient with a hemorrhagic cerebral infarction an elevation of serum ADH (5.7 pg/ml; normal = 1 to 5 pg/ml) in association with a normal level of serum ANP (49.8 pg/ml; normal = 10 to 60 pg/ml) was seen. Six patients (2 with intracerebral hemorrhage and 1 with hemorrhagic cerebral infarction, 1 with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, 1 with glioblastoma multiforme, and 1 with Creutz-feldt-Jakob disease) had elevated serum ANP levels (197.0, 112.0, 92.0, 432.0, 97.5, and 138.0 pg/ml, respectively) associated with either normal or low ADH levels (1.3, 2.5, 1.2, 0.7, 2.3, and 0.5 pg/ml, respectively). Another patient with an intracerebral hemorrhage had a normal serum ANP level (37.0 pg/ml) and undetectable ADH level (less than 0.5 pg/ml). In the 7 patients in whom either ADH or ANP alone was elevated, a reciprocal relationship was observed between serum ADH and ANP levels, which could be expressed in logarithmic form (correlation coefficient, r = 0.727). In the 6 patients in whom serum ANP level alone was elevated, a near linear relationship was observed between serum ANP levels and urine sodium excretion (r = 0.851).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Analysis of 2920 gynecology patients for a 3-year period by payor (Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross, and commercial insurance) in the gynecology Diagnostic Related Groups that were not stratified for complications or comorbidities demonstrated that patients with more complications and comorbidities per Diagnostic Related Group for each payor generated higher total hospital costs, a longer hospital length of stay, a greater percentage of procedures per patient, financial risk under Diagnostic Related Group payment, more outliers, and a higher mortality compared with patients in these same Diagnostic Related Groups with fewer complications and comorbidities.

However, no study to date has used a controlled population for comparison, nor has any study delineated the physiologic mechanism of volume reduction. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a depot form of a GnRH analogue (leuprolide) given monthly for 24 weeks in 11 patients with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata. Patients initially treated with placebo were subsequently treated with active drug for 24 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify specifically the total uterine volume, total myoma volume, and total non-myoma volume. Treated patients had a significant reduction in total uterine and non-myoma volumes as compared with placebo patients (P less than .02). Total myoma volume was also reduced, but only to a P = .06 level. Pre- versus post-therapy values for all 11 patients showed significant reduction in all three volumes (P less than .02). Most symptoms were markedly improved. By 24 weeks post-therapy, all volumes had returned to baseline levels, although symptomatic improvement commonly persisted. The non-myoma volume was proportionally reduced to a greater extent than the myoma volume (42.7 versus 30.4%), and we therefore could explain the reenlargement seen when treatment was discontinued. Side effects were well tolerated and there were no study dropouts. We conclude that temporary hypoestrogenism induced by GnRH analogues can produce significant though temporary reduction in uterine volumes, and that the non-myoma volume is responsible for much of the reduction and reenlargement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Mammography remains substantially under-used in low-income minority populations despite its well-established efficacy as a means of breast cancer control. The Metropolitan Detroit Avoidable Mortality Project is a 2-year controlled clinical trial of coordinated interventions which seek to improve the use of early breast cancer detection services at five clinical sites providing primary health care services to inner-city women. Baseline assessment for two of the five participating clinic populations demonstrated that only one-quarter of women who visited these clinics were referred for mammography in 1988, and only half of those who were referred were able to complete the procedure. Patient characteristics including age, marital status, ethnicity, and insurance status were not associated with use of mammography during the baseline period. Each of the project's intervention components is a cue to action: a physician prompt for mammography referral within the medical record of procedure-due women, a reminder postcard for scheduled appointments, and a telephone call to encourage rescheduling of missed appointments. The interventions are initiated by a computerized information management system in the existing network of health care services. The patient's out-of-pocket mammography expense has been eliminated in three of the five sites. Although their efficacy as individual interventions has been well established, a controlled trial of computer prompts to physicians, reduced expense for patients, and patient appointment reminders as an integrated system in inner-city medical care settings has not been previously described. We have implemented the prompting, facilitated rescheduling procedures, and eliminated patient expense for mammography at three of five eventual clinical sites. This report provides an overview of the study's design, data management system, and methodology for evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "Most types of cancer are disproportionately present in black populations. Among all ethnic and racial groups, black people have the highest incidence of all types of cancer combined, experiencing the highest mortality and the worst survival rate. A major intervention effort has begun in Chicago, targeting women living in 10 south side community areas whose populations are almost all black and among the poorest in the city. The purposes of the intervention are to develop and evaluate ways to reduce morbidity and mortality from breast and cervical cancer. Three outcome measures are being used, the proportion of women who receive Papanicolaou smears, breast examinations, and mammograms; the scores derived from a knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey; and the stage of diagnosed cancer. The results are being evaluated in three locations, the 10 target community areas, a Chicago Health Department clinic located in the community, and Fantus Clinic at Cook County Hospital. The intervention consists of reducing barriers to care at both public clinic sites and delivering education and information within the community. Public health outreach workers who are culturally sensitive to the population bring word of the program to places frequented by women, including local businesses (such as beauty shops, grocery stores, pharmacies, and currency exchanges), public housing developments (one being the largest in the country), and facilities belonging to city services programs. The intervention was developed to permit its ready adoption in similar environments should the evaluation results prove its usefulness.\r"

The educational program includes distributing electronic and printed information media messages, a program of direct education for women, and providing information on current issues in cervical screening to primary-care physicians. Program development was based on social marketing principles, the PRECEDE model, and the communication-behavior change (CBC) model. Since a true experimental design was not feasible, program evaluation is based on several complementary quasi-experimental designs. Analysis of baseline data indicate that the county where the intervention is taking place, and the control county, are similar with respect to both demographic characteristics and the current level of screening activity. Preliminary results indicate that the program has been successful in raising women's level of awareness of cervical cancer and cervical screening.\r"

  ".W": "The Office of Minority Health (OMH) was established in December 1985 in response to recommendations developed by the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health. Originally, OMH's mission emphasized six health problems identified by the Task Force as priority areas: cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke; chemical dependency; diabetes; homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries; and infant mortality and low birth weight. OMH added HIV infection to the six health priority areas after epidemiologic data showed that the representation of blacks and Hispanics was disproportionately high among persons reported with AIDS. Strategies to eliminate or reduce high-risk behaviors associated with HIV infection need to mobilize racial and ethnic minority communities and rebuild social networks in order to foster sustained behavioral changes. OMH created the Minority HIV Education/Prevention Grant Program to demonstrate the effectiveness of strategies to expand the activities of minority community-based and national organizations involved in HIV education and prevention, as well as to encourage innovative approaches to address appropriately the diversities within and among minority populations. In 1988, grants totaling $1.4 million were awarded to four national and 23 community-based minority organizations. Project workers conduct information, education, and prevention interventions directed to specific groups within racial and ethnic minority communities. Interventions include education and prevention training, information activities, developing educational materials, and providing technical assistance. Project innovations include conducting HIV education and prevention training for families at home, presenting a play produced and performed by local teenagers, and developing a workshop and a manual to help minority service organizations to recruit and train volunteer staff members.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are more prevalent among some minority populations in the United States than they are among the white majority. Primary and secondary syphilis occurs 45 times as often among non-Hispanic blacks as among non-Hispanic whites and 13 times as often among Hispanics as among non-Hispanic whites, according to morbidity reports received in 1988 by the Centers for Disease Control. Gonorrhea is reported more commonly among some minorities, with 1988 rates per 100,000 population being 54 for whites, 1,801 for blacks, and 201 for Hispanics. The reasons for the higher incidence of STD among some minorities are unknown. Data on racial differences in behavior and disease susceptibility are meager and do not account for the observed differences. Poverty, which is more common among some minorities than among the white majority, is closely associated with the prevalence of STD and may be a link between membership in a minority population and an increased risk.\r"

  ".W": "Native Americans experienced higher reported gonorrhea and syphilis morbidity than did non-Native Americans from 1984 through 1988 in 13 States with large Native American populations. Gonorrhea rates among American Indians and Alaska Natives were approximately twice the rates for non-Indians. The highest gonorrhea rate was reported among Alaska Natives, with a 5-year average of 1,470 cases per 100,000, more than five times the average non-Native rate in Alaska. The average primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis rate from 1984 through 1988 was more than two times higher among Native Americans, largely due to high syphilis morbidity in Arizona and New Mexico. In Arizona the average American Indian P&S syphilis case rate was seven times higher than the non-Indian rate. True rates for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) among Native Americans may be higher than those reported due to racial misclassification of Native American cases, particularly in nonreservation areas. Improved recognition and reporting of STD cases among Native Americans are needed to target STD prevention and education more effectively.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the high rates of smoking-related cancers among black Americans, little is known about the type of smoking prevention program that might be effective with black youth. The current study pilot-tested a promising smoking prevention approach to determine its feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. A total of 608 students in nine predominantly black urban junior high schools were stratified by community and randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions. Students in the treatment condition participated in a 12-session smoking prevention program which taught resistance skills and general life skills. Process data indicated that this prevention approach was feasible and acceptable to students, teachers, and administrators. Outcome data indicated that this program reduced the proportion of children who smoked in the past month by 56 percent, and it increased knowledge of the adverse consequences of smoking and normative expectations concerning adult and peer smoking. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for prevention and modifications which might further strengthen the efficacy of this approach for urban black adolescents.\r"

  ".U": "90068762\r", 
  ".W": "Preventing the initiation of cigarette smoking plays a vital role in reducing rates of cigarette smoking. The authors investigated trends in cigarette smoking initiation among Mexican Americans, Cuban Americans, Puerto Rican Americans, compared with whites, by examining the cigarette smoking histories of adults from the 1982-83 Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 1987 National Health Interview Survey. To evaluate these trends, they calculated the prevalence of cigarette smoking among 20-24-year-olds, an indicator of the rate of smoking initiation, in successive 5-year birth cohorts from 1908-12 to 1958-62 among Hispanics and from 1908-12 to 1963-67 among whites. Recently, rates of smoking initiation among Mexican American and Cuban American men have declined and converged with rates of initiation among white men. However, rates of initiation among Puerto Rican American men appeared to have remained unchanged since the 1950s. During the 1970s rates of smoking initiation among Cuban American and Puerto Rican American women surpassed those of white women. In the early 1980s, however, rates of initiation among these groups of Hispanic women have declined to levels comparable to or perhaps lower than the rates among white women. Although recently the rates among Mexican American women have been the lowest of all groups of women, they have not experienced appreciable declines. In general, rates of smoking initiation either declined or leveled off later for Hispanics than for whites. These results suggest that Hispanics tended to follow the smoking trends observed among whites and that special efforts are needed to prevent cigarette smoking among Hispanics.\r"

The authors suggest research priorities designed to promote more effective communications programming in the substance abuse field, and they identify three key target audiences: children and adolescents, women of childbearing age, and heavy-drinking men. The significance of the diversity within the Hispanic community; the opportunities to reinforce attitudes, norms, and behaviors that counter substance use; and the centrality of family are discussed as approaches to communications planning and message development.\r"

  ".W": "A group of Mexican American and white American school dropouts were compared with a control group and a group of academically at-risk students in three locations in the Southwest. The sample group consisted of school dropouts and comparison subjects in grades 6 through 12. Both comparison groups were matched with the dropouts by sex, ethnicity, and school grade. At risk students also were matched by age and grade point average. Dropout subjects were found to have the highest rates of alcohol and drug use, followed by at risk student subjects. The relative rates of use were about the same for nearly all drugs, with the largest differences found for drinking to intoxication and use of marijuana, uppers, and cocaine. Among the dropouts, 75 percent of Mexican American males and 90 percent of white American males had tried marijuana. More than a third of the dropouts had tried cocaine. One-third of the Mexican American males and more than half of the females in both the Mexican American and the white American group had tried uppers. Females, especially dropouts, had higher rates of tobacco smoking than males. The rates of cigarette smoking among dropouts were significantly greater than among the control group only for males. Health problems of parents were not related to dropping out of school for any of the ethnic or sex groups. However, dropouts were more likely to have had serious illness within the preceding year than members of the control group. Many dropouts live in a violent and dangerous world. As an example, about one in five dropouts had held a gun on someone in a confrontation, and 20 percent had cut someone with a knife. Nearly half had been badly beaten. Females were rarely perpetrators of crimes or misdemeanors, but were often victims. Forty-two percent of the white American female dropouts had been either raped or sexually assaulted. Mexican American females were found less likely to be victims of violence, which perhaps reflects cultural values of marianisma and machismo, involving protectiveness toward females.\r"

  ".U": "90068765\r", 
  ".W": "In many metropolitan areas, homicide continues to be the scourge of black Americans despite increasing awareness of the overrepresentation of blacks among victims and perpetrators. The risk of being a homicide victim among black males is so high that the Department of Health and Human Services has set a priority of reducing the risk to 60 per 100,000 by 1990. The recent escalation in the number of homicides in the United States associated with drugs makes attainment of that goal unlikely. In Kansas City, a black community grassroots organization, the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime, commissioned a multidisciplinary task force to study black-on-black homicide in 1986. The report generated by this task force identified factors placing Kansas Citians at high risk of being homicide victims or perpetrators, including being black, male, unemployed, between the ages 17-29, a high school nongraduate, frequently involved in or around violence, and having prior arrests on weapons charges. One hundred recommendations were made, of which 12 were targeted for immediate implementation. These included increasing public awareness of the incidence of black-on-black homicide, involvement of black men in role model programs for young black males, training in anger control and alternatives to violence for those identified as being at high risk for homicide, and providing a role for ex-offenders in violence prevention. Working with community organizations has inherent strengths and weaknesses for public health workers. However, such a group can successfully impact the affected community in ways which would be difficult for traditional resources.\r"

This paper summarizes the relevant literature on prevalence of, and risk factors for, suicide among American Indian groups, with a strong emphasis on adolescents. Data concerning risk of suicide for a sample of high school students attending an Indian boarding school are presented. Approximately 23 percent of these students had attempted suicide at some time in the past, and 33 percent reported suicidal ideation within the past month. Students at greatest risk for suicide include those who reported having either family or friends who had attempted suicide and those who reported on standardized psychological measures as having experienced greater depressive symptomatology, greater quantity and frequency of alcohol use, or little family support. In a 1988 survey of community-based programs for Indian adolescents, 194 were identified as carrying out significant suicide prevention activities. Forty-one of those programs were school-based; they emphasized early identification of students' mental health problems and reduction of specific risk factors such as substance abuse.\r"
