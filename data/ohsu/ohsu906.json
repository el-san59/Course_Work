  ".W": "Adverse effects of the GnRH antagonist Antide on folliculogenesis and fertility were noted when we were evaluating the therapeutic value of Antide on endometriosis in a rat model. Cyclic rats with (n = 56) and without (n = 18) surgically induced endometriosis received Antide (2 mg/kg) or vehicle at noon on days 0 (proestrus), 3, 6, and 9. Rats were killed at noon on days 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 42, and 165. The number of antral follicles and the number of atretic antral follicles evaluated did not differ (P greater than 0.05) between endometriosis and control rats. Antide-treated rats had more (P less than 0.05 ) atretic antral follicles (64.7%) than vehicle-treated rats (15.3%). Antide-treated rat ovaries contained fewer corpora lutea than those of vehicle-treated rats on days 6, 12, and 18. No corpora lutea were found in Antide-treated rat ovaries after day 18. The abnormal ovarian morphology of the Antide-treated rats persisted for the duration of the project (165 days). Fertility (rats without endometriosis) was assessed by mating vehicle-and Antide-treated rats at spontaneous proestrus (n = 8) for eight posttreatment cycles as well as after follicular stimulation (n = 2). All vehicle-treated and no Antide-treated rats became pregnant. No oocytes were found in the oviducts of Antide-treated rats after eight cycles, indicating that ovulation had not occurred. The serum FSH and estradiol concentrations in the rats treated with Antide were lower (P less than 0.05) on days 6, 12, and 18, but rose to values equal to (days 24 and 30) or greater than (day 42) those in vehicle-treated rats. Serum progesterone levels in rats treated with Antide were lower (P less than 0.05) than those in vehicle-treated rats on all days tested. In conclusion, at a dosage sufficient to suppress reproductive cyclicity (and elicit the regression of endometriosis), Antide also caused long term follicular atresia and infertility.\r"

Na,K-ATPase, the major sodium pump, has been variously reported to be regulated by one or both classes of steroids. The present studies explore the ontogeny and steroidal regulation of Na,K-ATPase alpha- and beta-subunit mRNA levels in the descending colon. In descending colon, subunit mRNA levels are low before birth, increasing to reach adult levels at approximately day 25. Dexamethasone treatment caused a rapid dose-dependent increase in colonic Na,K-ATPase subunit mRNA levels. The specific glucocorticoid RU26988 also increased subunit mRNA levels. Aldosterone administration, at doses adequate to yield a profound antinatriuresis, did not alter subunit mRNA levels. Carbenoloxone sodium produced an approximately 3-fold increase in subunit mRNA levels in intact but not adrenalectomized rats. We have demonstrated that Na,K-ATPase subunit gene expression is: 1) low in the fetal colon but achieves plateau levels by day 25; 2) acutely regulated by corticosteroids via type II rather than type I receptors; and 3) increased by carbenoxolone sodium, presumably as a result of increased occupancy of the type II receptor by corticosterone.\r"

Thyrocytes were cultured in monolayers for 5-7 days and incubated with TSH (10 mU/ml) for 1 h before fixation. IFN gamma (200 U/ml) was added to the culture medium for 1 h to 5 days before TSH stimulation. Coculture of thyrocytes with IFN gamma for more than 24 h inhibited TSH-induced morphological changes in the thyrocytes; IFN gamma inhibited the increase in the number of and elongation of microvilli and the appearance of pseudopods. IFN gamma also reduced the number of actin filaments in thyrocytes, as confirmed by immunofluorescence photometry. These results suggest that IFN gamma inhibits the morphological response of thyrocytes to TSH stimulation by the reduction of actin filaments.\r"

  ".W": "Iodolactone (6-iodo-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic-delta-lactone), an iodinated derivative of arachidonic acid, was found to be synthesized in rat thyroid slices; however, the physiological role of this compound is still unknown. We tried to detect iodolactone in isolated porcine thyroid follicles and investigated the effects of in vitro synthesized iodolactone on epidermal growth factor-induced thyroid cell proliferation and TSH-induced cAMP formation. In vitro synthesis of iodolactone was performed with lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of arachidonic acid in the presence of trace amounts of [125I]- and [3H]arachidonic acid. After purification by silica gel chromatography, HPLC of the reaction products revealed one main peak containing trace amounts of both [125I]- and [3H]arachidonic acid. With gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) a molecular mass of 391 m/z, corresponding to the derivatization product of iodolactone, was found. An ethanol-chloroform extract of isolated thyroid follicles preincubated with KI (10 microM) and arachidonic acid (1 microM) revealed peaks in HPLC and GC comparable with those of in vitro synthesized iodolactone. This indicates the ability of thyroid follicles to form iodolactone. Iodolactone (0.1-1.0 microM) dose-dependently inhibited epidermal growth factor-induced thyroid cell growth. This growth-inhibiting effect of iodolactone was 50-fold more pronounced than the inhibitory effect of KI (4 X 10(-5) microM) on thyroid cell proliferation. In contrast to the effect of iodide, the inhibitory effect of iodolactone on thyroid cell growth could not be abolished by methimazole (1 mM). Basal as well as TSH (0.5 U/liter)-induced cAMP formation were not changed by iodolactone. These experiments suggest a physiological role of iodolactone as a mediator of the known inhibitory effect of iodide on thyroid growth.\r"

  ".U": "90298876\r", 
  ".W": "Sex steroids have been shown to influence the secretion of GH. There appears to be no good evidence of the effect of estradiol on the anterior pituitary, while the central site of estradiol action on the regulation of GH secretion is not known. The present investigation was carried out to determine whether some of the GH-releasing factor (GRF) neurons and somatostatin (SRIF) neurons in the hypothalamus and GH cells in the pituitary contain estradiol receptors. Colocalization of [3H]estradiol and antibodies to GRF or SRIF in brain and antibodies to GH in pituitary was studied to show interrelationships between estrogen target cells and peptidergic cells. Eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized, each rat was treated with colchicine, and 24-48 h later the animals were given an iv injection of [2,4,6,7,16,17-3H]estradiol (SA, 166 Ci/mM) at a dose of 0.5 micrograms/100 g BW. One hour after the injection, the rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The hypothalami from the perfused rats and the pituitaries from unperfused rats were frozen in isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen (-190 C) and processed for autoradiography. The brain autoradiograms were immunostained for GRF, SRIF, and tyrosine hydroxylase [TH; an enzyme for the synthesis of dopamine (DA)], and the pituitary autoradiograms were immunostained for GH by the avidin-biotin peroxidase method. The majority of GRF-containing neurons were found in the arcuate nucleus, with some scattered cells in the lateral region of the ventromedial nucleus and the basal lateral hypothalamus. In the central portion of the arcuate nucleus, 20-30% of GRF-containing neurons showed nuclear concentration of [3H]estradiol. In the anterior portion of the hypothalamus, 10-15% of immunoreactive GRF-containing neurons were labeled with [3H]estradiol. In the lateral basal hypothalamus and the lateral region to the ventromedial nucleus, a few GRF neurons showed nuclear concentration of radioactivity. In contrast, a few SRIF cells in hypothalamic periventricular nucleus showed nuclear labeling with [3H]estradiol. Dual immunostaining with GRF and TH antibodies revealed that the estradiol-labeled GRF neurons did not contain TH immunoreactivity. In addition, 80-90% of GH cells in the anterior pituitary showed nuclear concentration of [3H]estradiol. The present studies demonstrate for the first time that certain populations of GRF neurons are targets for estradiol and indicate that estradiol acts directly on certain hypothalamic GRF neurons. The results suggest that estradiol may have a role in the regulation of GH secretion by modulating GRF release and acting directly on the somatotrophs.\r"

Using affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antisera generated to synthetic PAM peptides and PAM RNA probes, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization studies were conducted to determine the tissue disposition and cell types expressing PAM in the adult male rat pituitary gland. PAM immunoreactivity was present at varying levels in nearly all of the anterior pituitary cells; one cell population stained intensely, while others stained moderately or weakly. These results correlated well with in situ hybridization studies that demonstrated high levels of PAM mRNA in a subpopulation comprising approximately 10-15% of the anterior pituitary cells. Based upon immunocytochemistry, intermediate pituitary lobe cells were divided into an intensely stained and a moderately stained group. PAM staining was also present in neural lobe fibers. Immunocytochemical staining of serial pituitary tissue sections for PAM and other pituitary hormones demonstrated that the anterior pituitary cells intensely stained for PAM represented a subpopulation of the gonadotropes. PAM was also identified at moderate levels in corticotropes and at lower levels in sommatotropes and lactotropes. These results suggest that many anterior pituitary cells are capable of producing amidated peptides along with their major peptide hormone.\r"

Studies with less pure inhibin from porcine follicles showed that increased binding could reach 7-fold within 48 h and was due to higher numbers of receptors for GnRH. The 48-h increase in GnRH receptors was linear with time and was rapidly reversible, since removal of inhibin at 24 h decreased GnRH binding below control levels at 48 h. Inhibin (bovine or porcine) also increased GnRH-stimulated secretion of LH by 2-fold. The ED50 for both inhibin actions noted above was in the range of 0.5-2.0 ng/ml (in terms of highly purified bovine inhibin). Progesterone (P) totally counteracted inhibin induction of GnRH binding and GnRH-stimulated LH secretion at 48 h. In the absence of inhibin, P decreased GnRH binding below control levels by as much as 80% within 48 h, but did not affect GnRH-stimulated LH secretion at 48 h. The ED50 for P action was near 1 nM, which is within the physiological range for P during the luteal phase of the sheep estrous cycle. The data suggest that P may act during the luteal phase to decrease receptors for GnRH. The rapid decrease in P during the 48 h before the preovulatory LH surge should permit GnRH receptors to rise under the influence of inhibin (and estradiol) to boost gonadotroph responsiveness to GnRH so the LH surge may occur to its fullest.\r"

Scatchard analysis indicated that E increased binding by increasing receptors for GnRH. GnRH-stimulated release of LH increased 2-fold along with the increase in GnRH receptors, but heightened responsiveness to GnRH disappeared after 27 h of E treatment even though GnRH receptors remained elevated. These data are consistent with the concepts that 1) E increased GnRH receptors, which initially enhanced gonadotroph responsiveness to GnRH, and 2) E subsequently nullified the increased response to GnRH by blocking a mechanism of LH secretion not associated with GnRH receptor number. Further support for this hypothesis came from studies with porcine follicular inhibin. Inhibin in ovine pituitary culture concomitantly increased GnRH receptors by 5-fold and GnRH-stimulated LH secretion by 2-fold. Inhibin maintained both effects long term (48 h). When E was added along with inhibin, the increase in GnRH receptor number became greater than with either hormone alone (7-fold increase at 48 h), but the initial increase in GnRH-stimulated LH secretion was fully inhibited by E at 48 h. The increase in GnRH receptors caused by E may be important physiologically to help create the preovulatory LH surge; the delayed inhibitory action of E on GnRH-stimulated LH secretion may limit the LH surge.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous publication we showed that addition of mouse epidermal growth factor (mEGF) to MA-10 Leydig tumor cells or rat luteal cells leads to an attenuation of the elevated rate of cAMP accumulation provoked by subsequent addition of hCG. Those studies also suggested that this was due to a decrease in the hCG-activated adenylyl cyclase activity, but formal proof of this hypothesis was not presented. The experiments presented herein were conducted to investigate the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon and show that our initial suggestion was correct, because we can show that mEGF attenuates the hCG-activated adenylyl cyclase in membranes from MA-10 cells or luteinized rat ovaries. More importantly, however, the establishment of a cell-free system in which mEGF attenuates adenylyl cyclase allows us to conduct detailed investigations on the molecular mechanisms that underly this phenomenon. Using this system we have been able to show that the ability of mEGF to attenuate adenylyl cyclase activity 1) is specific for the hCG-activated enzyme, since it cannot be detected when the enzyme is activated with other ligands, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide or isoproterenol; 2) does not appear to be due to a reduction in the activity of the catalytic subunit of adenylyl cyclase or the stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs), because mEGF does not affect the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by other effectors, and it has little or no effect on the ability of Gs to restore isoproterenol sensitivity to the adenylyl cyclase of S49 cyc- membranes; and 3) optimal expression of the mEGF effect can only be obtained in the presence of ATP or GTP.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an inflammatory cytokine that is produced by a variety of cells and tissues. We recently demonstrated that IL-6 is produced by anterior pituitary cells in response to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide and phorbol diester in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide (0.01-100 ng/ml) increased, whereas dexamethasone (0.1-100 nM) decreased, IL-6 production by anterior pituitary cells in vitro as measured by the 7TD1 cell growth factor assay. In addition, we now report that IL-6 production by anterior pituitary cells is stimulated by agents that elevate intracellular cAMP concentrations. Exposure of anterior pituitary cells to (Bu)2cAMP (0.01-10 mM), prostaglandin E2 (1.0-1000 nM), forskolin (50-1000 nM), or cholera toxin (0.25-250 ng/ml) for 6 h resulted in concentration-related increases in the production of IL-6, which, in the cases of forskolin and cholera toxin, correlated well with increased intracellular cAMP concentrations. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (1-1000 nM), which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in the anterior pituitary, caused a concentration-related enhancement of IL-6 production that was unaffected in the presence of 10-100 nM somatostatin. In contrast, GH-releasing factor had no effect on IL-6 production. These data suggest that anterior pituitary cells produce IL-6 in response to increased intracellular cAMP, and that the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide may act to regulate IL-6 production.\r"

  ".W": "The nuclear genome is the primary locus of activity for thyroid hormone and dexamethasone; however, one well described secondary effect of treatment with these hormones is increased mitochondrial respiratory activity. To examine the mechanism of the increase in respiration, we have treated a rat hepatoma cell line, HTC cells, with thyroid hormone and dexamethasone and measured their effects on the activity of a respiratory chain enzyme and on mitochondrial (mt) RNA and mtDNA levels. Thyroid hormone, but not dexamethasone, increased cytochrome c oxidase activity in HTC cells; the increase in activity was nearly 2-fold over control values. To determine whether this increased activity was the result of coordinate increases in expression of nuclear and cytoplasmic genes for this enzyme, we measured changes in the levels of messenger RNAs for both nuclear and mitochondrially encoded cytochrome oxidase subunits. Treatment of HTC cells with thyroid hormone and/or dexamethasone resulted in 3- to 4-fold increases in the levels of several RNAs encoded in the mt genome, including subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase. In contrast, this treatment had no effect on the messenger RNA encoding a nuclear subunit of this same enzyme. Neither of these hormones had any effect on cell number or on the level of mtDNA. Dose response and time course of thyroid hormone and dexamethasone administration on mtRNA levels were consistent with these hormones acting through their nuclear hormone receptors. Increased expression of the mt genome by alteration of transcription or RNA stability is a likely candidate for a mechanism by which these hormones can regulate mitochondrial activity.\r"

Here, we determined the in vitro and in vivo bioactivity of recombinant FSH produced by CHO mutant cells deficient in the glycosylation enzyme N-acetylglucosamine transferase-I (NAGT-), resulting in glycoproteins with asparagine-linked (GlcNAc)2(Mannose)5 oligosaccharides, or mutant cells defective in sialic acid transport into the Golgi (ST-). In the latter, glycoproteins are secreted lacking terminal sialic acids. Determination of in vitro bioactivity, using the granulosa cell aromatase bioassay, indicated that both FSH variants are as active as FSH secreted by the wild type (WT) cells and purified pituitary FSH. Also, these normal and variant forms of FSH are equipotent in a radioligand receptor assay using rat testis membranes. However, the variant FSH molecules are more basic than the WT FSH as determined using a chromatofocusing column (pI: wild type 3.6-5.0, NAGT- greater than 7.0, ST- approximately 6.0 and greater than 7.0). Injection of immature estrogen-treated rats with WT FSH induced high aromatase activity in their granulosa cells whereas treatment with either one of the FSH variants was ineffective; the lack of in vivo activity of the FSH variants was correlated with rapid clearance of these molecules in serum. Thus, recombinant human FSH produced by cells deficient in NAGT-I or defective in sialic acid transport retains normal receptor binding and in vitro bioactivity, but exhibits minimal in vivo activity and a shortened half-life when compared to WT FSH, indicating the important role of terminal sugars for FSH action in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we examined the action of arachidonic acid in the isolated rat lung perfused with a cell- and protein-free physiological salt solution. When pulmonary vascular tone was elevated by hypoxia, bolus injection of a large dose of arachidonic acid (75 micrograms) caused transient vasoconstriction followed by vasodilation. When arachidonic acid (100 micrograms) was injected during normoxia and at base-line perfusion pressure (low vascular tone) or when vascular tone was elevated by KCl, arachidonic acid (50 micrograms) caused only vasoconstriction. Doses less than 7.5 micrograms caused vasodilation only when injected during hypoxic vasoconstriction and subsequent blunting of either angiotensin II- or hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction. The higher doses of arachidonic acid (7.5 and 75 micrograms), but not the lower doses (7.5-750 ng), caused increases in effluent 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, thromboxane B2, and prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha. 6-Ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha was the major cyclooxygenase product. Meclofenamate (10(-5) M) blocked the increased metabolite synthesis over the entire dose range of arachidonic acid tested (7.5 ng-75 micrograms). Because vasodilation immediately after arachidonic acid was cyclooxygenase-independent, we investigated whether this effect was due to the unsaturated fatty acid properties of arachidonic acid and compared its action with that of oleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Because neither compound mimicked the vasodilation observed with arachidonic acid, we concluded that the cyclooxygenase-independent action of arachidonic acid could not be explained by unsaturated fatty acid properties per se. Because 1-aminobenzotriazole, a cytochrome P-450 inhibitor, partially inhibited the immediate arachidonic acid-induced pulmonary vasodilation, we concluded that cytochrome P-450-dependent metabolites can account for some of the cyclooxygenase-independent vasodilation of arachidonic acid.\r"

The effect of further increases in inspired CO2 to hypercarbic levels has not been studied in inflammatory lung disease. Three days after induction of sublobar Pseudomonas pneumonia, Suffolk sheep were anesthetized and ventilated with a fixed-volume ventilator. After 2.5 h, CO2 was added to the inspired gas to raise arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) to 60-65 Torr. Four hours later the CO2 was withdrawn and ventilation continued for an additional 2 h. Constant minute ventilation and inspired O2 fraction were maintained. Regional lung perfusion was measured by injection of radioactive microspheres. With the administration of CO2, PaO2 increased significantly from 65.5 to 77.5 Torr as did alveolar O2 tension (from 109.7 to 120.0 Torr) with no significant change in alveolar-arterial O2 difference. There were no significant changes in cardiac output, shunt fraction, O2 uptake, O2 delivery, respiratory quotient, or distribution of regional lung perfusion. We conclude that the increases in alveolar O2 tension and PaO2 with the added CO2 resulted from improved alveolar ventilation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of increased airway resistance on lung volumes and pattern of breathing were studied in eight subjects performing leg exercise on a cycle ergometer. Airway resistance was changed 1) by increasing the density (D) of the respired gas by a factor of 4.2 and changing the inspired gas from O2 at 1.3 bar to air at 6 bar and 2) by increasing airway flow rates by exposing the subjects to incremental work loads of 0-200 W. Increased gas D caused a slower and deeper respiration at rest and during exercise and, at work loads greater than 120 W, depressed the responses of ventilation and mean inspiratory flow. Raised airway resistance induced by increases in D and/or airway flow rates altered respiratory timing by increasing the ratio of inspiratory time (TI) to total breath duration. Furthermore, analyses of the relationships between tidal volume and TI and between end-inspiratory volume and TI revealed elevation of Hering-Breuer inspiratory volume thresholds. We propose that this elevation, and hence exercise-induced increases of tidal volume, can largely be explained by previous observations that the threshold of the inspiratory off-switch mechanisms depends on central inspiratory activity (cf. C. von Euler, J. Appl. Physiol. 55: 1647-1659, 1983), which in turn increases with airway resistance (Acta Physiol. Scand. 120: 557-565, 1984).\r"

To determine whether progesterone and estrogen stimulated hypoxic ventilatory and CBNO responsiveness, we studied 24 castrated male cats before and after 1 wk of placebo, estrogen, progesterone, or estrogen plus progesterone treatment. Estrogen plus progesterone treatment decreased end-tidal PCO2 (-3.8 +/- 0.8 Torr) and increased hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness, whereas estrogen or progesterone alone had no effect. Animals receiving progesterone alone or in combination with estrogen had higher CBNO responsiveness than placebo or estrogen-treated animals (shape parameter A = 45 +/- 7 vs. 27 +/- 4, P less than 0.05). However, the group treated with estrogen plus progesterone did not have greater CBNO responsiveness to hypoxia than the group receiving progesterone alone. The cross plot of the simultaneously measured CBNO and ventilation during progressive hypoxia revealed a greater slope in the estrogen-treated than in the placebo animals, suggesting that estrogen treatment increased central nervous system transduction of CBNO into ventilation. Thus the data taken together suggested that progesterone and estrogen had a combination of peripheral (carotid body) and central sites of action such that the administration of both hormones together had a more consistent stimulatory effect on hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness than either hormone alone.\r"

The monoexponential rate constant for Xe washout (XeW) was -0.4 +/- 0.08 (SE) min-1 at functional residual capacity (FRC) with no blood flow in the injected region. It decreased by more than half at lung volumes 500 ml above and 392 ml below FRC. With intact pulmonary blood flow, XeW was -1.0 +/- 0.08 (SE) min-1 at FRC, and it increased with decreasing lung volume. However, if calculated Xe uptake by the blood was subtracted from the XeW measured with blood flow intact, resulting values at FRC and at FRC + 500 ml were not different from XeW with no blood flow. Reasonable calculation of Xe blood uptake at 392 ml below FRC was not possible because airway closure, increased shunt, and other factors affect XeW. After death, no significant XeW could be measured, which suggests that XeW caused by molecular diffusion was small. We conclude that 1) the effect of heart motion on the lung parenchyma increases acinar gas mixing during apnea, 2) this effect diminishes above or below FRC, and 3) there is probably no direct effect of pulmonary vascular pulsatility on acinar gas mixing.\r"

The sensation of difficulty in breathing was rated at 30-s intervals by use of a visual analog scale. There were no differences in the level of ventilation or the base-line intensity of dyspnea before any of the interventions. The intensity of dyspnea grew linearly with increases in ventilation during HC [r = 0.98 +/- 0.02 (SD)], E (0.95 +/- 0.03), and IVH (0.95 +/- 0.06). The change in intensity of dyspnea produced by a given change in ventilation was significantly greater during HC [0.27 +/- 0.04 (SE)] than during E (0.12 +/- 0.02, P less than 0.01) and during HC (0.30 +/- 0.04) than during IVH (0.16 +/- 0.03, P less than 0.01). The difference in intensity of dyspnea between HC and E or HC and IVH increased as the difference in end-tidal PCO2 widened, even though the time course of the increase in ventilation was similar. No significant differences were measured in the intensity of dyspnea that occurred with changes in ventilation between E and IVH. These results indicate that under nearisocapnic conditions the sensation of dyspnea produced by a given level of ventilation seems not to depend on the method used to produce that level of ventilation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-three patients (17%) had had a single episode of acute hepatitis while on dialysis and two patients had had two episodes, which were attributed to infection by hepatitis B virus in 7 instances and by hepatitis non-A, non-B virus in 20. Chronicity supervened in 4 cases of hepatitis B (57%) and in 14 cases of hepatitis non-A, non-B (70%). A prolonged rise of serum aminotransferases, which was not preceded by acute hepatitis, was detected in 23 additional patients (17%). Acute hepatitis and prolonged hypertransaminasemia were more frequent in patients dialyzed at a hospital unit than in patients dialyzed outside the hospital or at home. These observations indicate that development of acute and chronic liver disease, mainly hepatitis non-A, non-B, is frequent in patients on chronic hemodialysis, particularly in those dialyzed in hospital. Serologic evidence of current or past infection by HBV was detected in 57 patients (42%) with sustained positivity of HBV serum markers. Transient positivity for anti-HBc, anti-HBs, or both, possibly related to passive transmission of antibodies by blood transfusion, was observed in 20 patients (15%). These findings indicate that periodic, repeated testing for HBV serum markers is necessary only in a minority of patients on long-term hemodialysis.\r"

  ".W": "Gamma-L-glutamyl-L-dopa (or gludopa), a dopamine (DA) prodrug, is selectively metabolized in vivo by the kidney through the sequential action of two renal enzymes, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). This study was designed to analyze, in vitro, the factors regulating gludopa metabolism and its renal vascular effects. Rat kidneys were perfused in closed circuit with a cell-free perfusion buffer containing 6% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Adding gludopa (final concentration 10(-5) M in the perfusate) led to the release of DA both into urine and perfusate (0.53 +/- 0.21 and 1.38 +/- 0.28 nmol/min/g kidney wt, respectively, during the first 5 min after substrate addition, N = 5, mean +/- SEM). Total DA release (urine plus perfusate) was 73.7 +/- 15.8 nmol/g kidney wt within 30 minutes of recirculation. In non-filtering kidneys, total DA release in the recirculating medium was lower (12.5 +/- 1.4 nmol/g kidney wt, P less than 0.01). Glomerular filtration and access to the gamma-GT on the brush border membrane of proximal tubular cells are therefore required for the maximal conversion rate of gludopa. On filtering kidneys, L-dopa was also converted to DA, but at a higher rate than gludopa (total DA formed within 30 min of recirculation = 131.2 +/- 31.9 nmol/g kidney wt) and this rate was not reduced in non-filtering kidneys (224.2 +/- 41.7 nmol/g kidney wt DA formed within 30 min). Metabolic conversion of L-dopa by AADC is thus preserved in the case of an approach via the basolateral side of the proximal tubular cells. The renal vascular effects of gludopa were studied after vascular tone had been restored by continuous perfusion of PGF2 alpha and after the inhibition of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Gludopa (3.10(-6) to 4.10(-5) M) elicited concentration-dependent renal vasodilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Changes of rubidium uptake were interpreted to reflect altered sodium entry and basolateral Na-K-ATPase activity. The effects of hydrochlorothiazide, amiloride and furosemide were determined in saline-loaded animals. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibited rubidium uptake in proximal convoluted and distal convoluted tubule cells. The effect was largest in distal convoluted tubule cells. Amiloride reduced rubidium uptake in principal cells as well as in proximal convoluted, distal convoluted and connecting tubule cells. Furosemide depressed rubidium uptake in distal convoluted tubule cells, but increased uptake in principal cells. Rubidium uptake into intercalated cells was not affected by any of the diuretics used. Hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride altered rubidium uptake also in cells not associated with the main diuretic action. These effects of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride may be due to interference with cell transport mechanisms of Na-H and anion exchange.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of thrombin, interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) on the release of plasminogen activator (PA) and inhibitor (PAI) were studied using cultivated human glomerular epithelial cells (GECs). Species of PAs and PAI secreted from the GECs were urokinase-type PA (u-PA) and tissue-type PA (t-PA), while the major species was a single chain u-PA in the amount of 28.6 +/- 2.34 ng/10(5) cells for 24 hours (N = 4, mean +/- SD), and PAI-1. The addition of increased concentrations of thrombin (0.1 to 31.6 U/ml) into confluent cultures enhanced the GECs to release u-PA, t-PA and PAI-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The incubation of the GECs with 10 U/ml thrombin resulted in about a fourfold increase in the concentration of u-PA, threefold in t-PA and twofold in PAI-1. All thrombin effects, however, were suppressed by the simultaneous addition of cycloheximide, indicating that the enhancing effects of thrombin were due to an increase in the production of PAs and PAI-1, via protein synthesis. These thrombin effects appeared to be dependent upon the enzymatically active site of thrombin because DFP-thrombin had no effect. In the conditioned medium which was under continuous thrombin stimulation for 24 hours, no u-PA activity was detectable, even after the plasmin treatment, because a single chain u-PA was degraded by the thrombin. The stimulation of cultured GECs with thrombin only for the first three hours in 24 hour cultivation showed an apparent increase in the antigenic amount of u-PA. IL-1 enhanced the release of t-PA and PAI-1, and TNF did that of u-PA and t-PA, while gamma-IFN showed no significant effects. These findings indicate that the GECs participate in the regulation of extracapillary fibrinolysis in the glomerular microenvironment, as being modulated by thrombin and two cytokines, IL-1 and TNF.\r"

A series of patients treated with the KTP laser that revealed some practical advantages of this instrument over other lasers presently available is reported. The KTP laser has been designed with user safety in mind. In general, the KTP laser, with its angled, low-profile, lightweight hand pieces, was especially useful in anatomically confined locations, where a laser beam directed from an attachment operated with a joy stick mounted on the operating microscope would prove awkward. The KTP laser provided very good hemostasis. Certain large fibrous tumors were found to be more easily removed using a combination of the KTP laser and ultrasonic aspiration rather than with either instrument alone.\r"

In this study, we performed positron emission tomography studies to measure cerebral circulation in a total of 11 patients who sustained head injuries with contusion. Several parameters were measured including regional cerebral blood flow, regional cerebral blood volume, permeability, and regional cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen. Data from brains both with and without contusion were analyzed for chronological changes, in the subacute stage from the 8th to 29th day and in the chronic stage until 360 days after the injury and compared with similar data in a group of normal subjects. It was concluded that in the subacute stage, regional cerebral blood flow decreased (26 +/- 7 and 39 +/- 10 ml/100 g/min) and regional cerebral blood volume increased (5.6 +/- 1.8 and 5.4 +/- 0.9 ml/100 g) both in areas of cerebral contusion and in areas remote from cerebral contusion and that permeability increased in areas of contusion but not in remote brain areas. In the chronic stage, these parameters showed a tendency for recovery.\r"

Cellular immunity is the major mechanism of host defense against these intracellular pathogens. Selective immaturity in certain functions of T lymphocytes appears to be a major factor in the neonate's susceptibility to these infections. Particularly striking is the deficiency in production of interferon-gamma. We review the data regarding the deficiency in the production of interferon-gamma by cells of healthy and infected neonates, discuss what is known regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms for this deficiency, and review the unique role played by interferon-gamma in host defense against intracellular pathogens. The response of the neonate's effector cells to the immunoenhancing effects of interferon-gamma appears to be variable; diminished enhancement by interferon-gamma of cytotoxic cell function and the production of tumor necrosis factor by macrophages may further compound the effects of diminished production of interferon-gamma.\r"

Although a cause-and-effect relation between low serum IgG levels and neonatal infections has not been established, prophylaxis of such severe infections may be possible by replacement of antibody with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). For success, IVIG must provide specific antibodies to neonatal pathogens and reach therapeutic serum IgG target levels. Pilot investigations have demonstrated that IVIG reduces the incidence of bacterial sepsis among premature infants. Infants received IVIG every 2 weeks (or more frequently) until they weighed 2,000 g. Serum IgG levels were monitored after each dose so that the dose could be adjusted to achieve a target IgG level greater than 700 mg/dL. The observation that infection among placebo-treated patients occurred when the serum IgG level declined to less than 400 mg/dL suggests the importance of achieving a target level. In our preliminary analysis, the IVIG used did not reduce the incidence of infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rotavirus or of necrotizing enterocolitis. That the lot of IVIG used did not contain significant antibody to RSV or rotavirus emphasizes the importance of pathogen-specific antibody. Because of the preliminary nature of these results and the potential for undetermined short-term and long-term sequelae, we do not recommend the indiscriminant use of IVIG for prevention or treatment of neonatal infections.\r"

This hypogammaglobulinemia is believed to contribute to their high frequency of late-onset sepsis, with its accompanying morbidity and mortality. Animal studies suggest that human immunoglobulin prepared for intravenous use (IVIG) improves host defense against pathogens that cause neonatal infections, but studies of IVIG in human neonates have been inconclusive because of the small numbers of infants included, lack of suitable controls, use of clinical rather than strict microbiologic definition of sepsis, and performance only in a single hospital outside the United States. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial in the United States is in progress to determine the efficacy of IVIG in the prevention of late-onset infections in infants with birth weights between 500 and 1,750 g. Infants are infused with 500 mg of IVIG/kg or albumin-saline placebo at 3-7 days of age, 7 days later, and every 14 days for five doses. Efficacy parameters include mortality, number of proved infectious episodes (bacterial, fungal, or viral), and infection-related morbidity. Definitive guidelines for the possible use of prophylactic IVIG in low-birth-weight neonates should result from this evaluation of 500 to 700 infants in the United States.\r"

In the vertebrate nervous system, the best understood long-lasting change in synaptic strength is long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Here the process is initiated postsynaptically, but the site of the persistent change is unresolved. Single CA3 hippocampal pyramidal cells receive excitatory inputs from associational-commissural fibers and from the mossy fibers of dentate granule cells and both pathways exhibit LTP. Although the induction of associational-commissural LTP requires in the postsynaptic cell N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, membrane depolarization, and a rise in calcium, mossy fiber LTP does not. Paired-pulse facilitation, which is an index of increased transmitter release, is unaltered during associational-commissural LTP but is reduced during mossy fiber LTP. Thus, both the induction and the persistent change may be presynaptic in mossy fiber LTP but not in associational-commissural LTP.\r"

Although immune responses to Mlsa antigens are controlled by B cells, CD8+ T cells were the most effective cell type for induction of Mlsa tolerance. Tolerance was evident in both thymus and lymph nodes and could be induced by as few as 2 x 10(4) CD8+ T cells; these cells were 50 to 100 times as potent as CD4+ cells or B cells in causing functional tolerance and deletion of V beta 6+ T cells. Thus, intrathymic contact with antigens expressed on CD8+ T cells may play an important role in controlling the normal development of tolerance.\r"

Here sphingoid bases derived in cells from sphingolipid breakdown are shown to have a potent and direct effect in mediating calcium release from intracellular stores. Sphingosine must be enzymically converted within the cell to a product believed to be sphingosine-1-phosphate, which thereafter effects calcium release from a pool including the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive calcium pool. The sensitivity, molecular specificity, and reversibility of the effect on calcium movements closely parallel sphingoid base-mediated inhibition of protein kinase C. Generation of sphingoid bases in cells may activate a dual signaling pathway involving regulation of calcium and protein kinase C, comparable perhaps to the phosphatidylinositol and calcium signaling pathway.\r"

Mobilization of intracellular calcium predominated during the spike phase of the calcium response to endothelin, whereas calcium entry through dihydropyridine-sensitive channels contributed to both the spike and plateau phases of the calcium response. Endothelin was a potent as hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in stimulation of gonadotropin release in perifused pituitary cells. Endothelin bound specifically to pituitary cells with a dissociation constant of 70 picomolar, and induced rapid formation of inositol trisphosphate and diacyglycerol. Although intracellular calcium concentration and gonadotropin secretory responses to endothelin were independent to the GnRH receptor, endothelin and GnRH appeared to have a common signal transduction mechanism. These observations suggest that endothelin can act as a neuropeptide to regulate anterior pituitary function.\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic effects of prostaglandin E1, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), nitroglycerin, and hydralazine were studied in a porcine model of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) due to glass bead microembolization (60-150-microns diameter). Each animal received all four drugs. Each drug was titrated to produce a 30% reduction in mean systemic arterial pressure. Although all four drugs decreased PVR, distinct differences in the hemodynamic profiles of the four drugs were evident. Prostaglandin E1 produced the largest reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure (from 41 +/- 1 to 32 +/- 9 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM) and PVR (25 +/- 3 to 18 +/- 2 mm Hg.L-1.min-1), and did not affect the ratio of PVR to systemic vascular resistance (PVR/SVR). Sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerin produced moderate decreases in PVR (nitroglycerin 21 +/- 2 to 18 +/- 2 mm Hg.L-1.min-1, SNP 22 +/- 2 to 19 +/- 2 mm Hg.L-1.min-1) and in mean pulmonary artery pressure (nitroglycerin 39 +/- 1 to 35 +/- 1; SNP 40 +/- 1 to 36 +/- 2 mm Hg). Both drugs significantly increased the PVR/SVR ratio. Hydralazine was the only drug that significantly increased cardiac output (1.6 +/- 0.2 to 1.9 +/- 0.3 L/min). Hydralazine had no significant effect on mean pulmonary artery pressure, reduced PVR to the smallest extent (11%), and resulted in the largest increase in the PVR/SVR ratio (from 0.52 +/- 0.04 to 0.80 +/- 0.08). In this model of increased pulmonary vasculature resistance prostaglandin E1 caused an equivalent amount of pulmonary and systemic vasodilation, as expressed by the PVR/SVR ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cromolyn sodium has been reported to inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) in dogs and sheep, presumably by stabilizing mast cell membranes and thereby preventing the release of mediators such as leukotrienes. Because the effects of leukotriene synthesis and receptor blockers on HPV have been variable across studies, we studied the effect of cromolyn on HPV in the halothane-anesthetized sheep, a model in which we have found leukotriene synthesis and receptor blockers to be ineffective. In control animals, hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.13) increased pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) 67% and pulmonary vascular resistance 85%, and these responses were reproducible with a second episode of hypoxia. In a second group of sheep, hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.13) during cromolyn administration (6 mg.kg-1.min-1) for 30 min increased (Ppa) 104% and increased pulmonary vascular resistance 124%. In a third group of sheep, cromolyn sodium (6 mg.kg-1.min-1) without hypoxia did not significantly affect pulmonary hemodynamics. We conclude that cromolyn sodium does not inhibit HPV in halothane-anesthetized sheep. In experimental designs in which cromolyn does alter HPV, the effect is more likely due to altered release of modulators of HPV rather than to decreased release of obligatory mediator of HPV.\r"

To gain insight into the frequency of surgical complications of ileal diverticula, we reviewed our experience during the past ten years with 21 patients, 12 women, and nine men. The mean patient age was 62 years; 16 patients (76%) were more than 50 years of age. Thirteen patients had associated diverticula in another segment of the small intestine. In 15 patients ileal diverticulosis was diagnosed during gastrointestinal (GI) radiologic evaluation of abdominal symptomatology. Ileal diverticula were identified intraoperatively in the remaining six patients. In three patients ileal diverticulosis was an incidental finding. Documented surgical complications of acquired ileal diverticula occurred in four patients (19%). Three patients had acute diverticular perforation, and one patient had diverticulitis without perforation. These patients underwent successful operative intervention. Three other patients, all managed nonoperatively, had abdominal symptoms that may have been related to ileal diverticula and were of potential surgical significance. Two patients experienced recurrent rectal bleeding, and the third patient had severe chronic abdominal pain. Although the majority of patients with acquired ileal diverticula do not require surgical treatment, complications such as perforation, bleeding, or incapacitating abdominal pain may necessitate ileal resection.\r"

Our data showed a sensitivity of 95 per cent and a specificity of 100 per cent for diagnosis of breast malignancies on these patients.

Each antigen displayed a distinctive cellular staining pattern. HLA-DR was strongly localized to perinuclear zones with intense cell surface expression; HLA-DQ displayed a perinuclear accentuation, but with minimal cell surface staining, and ICAM-I was strongly expressed in a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern with intense cell surface expression. Keratinocytes grown in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum underwent differentiation, with a diminished expression of all three antigens as compared to those grown in low-calcium, serum-free medium. These results confirm that gamma interferon can differentially regulate HLA-DR and HLA-DQ expression; that there are probably different biochemical metabolic pathways by which these three molecules are expressed on keratinocytes, and that the expression is also a function of the degree of keratinocyte differentiation. The strong cell surface expression of ICAM-I is suggested to be of major importance as the recognition molecule, by which T cells bind to gamma interferon exposed keratinocytes, and suggests an integral role for this molecule in epidermal lymphocyte trafficking.\r"

Cultured eosinophils (CE) were compared with normal-density peripheral blood eosinophils (PBE) in terms of their membrane receptor expression and function. Fc gamma R and CR1 expression of CE and PBE was similar. In contrast, the specific mean fluorescence for LFA-1 alpha, p150,95 alpha, ICAM-1, and HLA-DR was significantly elevated for CE compared with PBE. CE responded in PAF-induced chemotaxis in a similar fashion to PBE. CE gave higher numbers of both resting and platelet activating factor (PAF)-stimulated immunoglobulin G (IgG)- and C3b-dependent rosettes than PBE. CE and PBE had comparable capacity to kill IgG- and C-opsonized schistosomula in terms of both baseline values and PAF-induced enhancement of cytotoxicity. Baseline adherence by CE and PBE to plasma-coated glass was essentially the same, but stimulated adhesion (PAF) of CE was lower. Compared with PBE, CE generated less than half the amounts of extracellular and cell-associated PAF induced by calcium ionophore A23187 stimulation. Unlike PBE, CE did not generate PAF after exposure to IgG-coated Sepharose particles. CE stimulated with IgG-coated beads generated small quantities of LTC4, while A23187 stimulation resulted in approximately half the LTC4 levels observed with PBE. The total cell content of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) was similar for CE and PBE. These data suggest that although CE and PBE have many phenotypic and functional properties in common there are quantitative differences that may be a consequence of their immaturity and/or the influence of the cytokines used in their culture.\r"

The symptoms and signs subsided mostly within a month of hospitalization. The major population of the lymphocytes at admission was positive for CD3, CD8 (4/8 ratio, 0.16), WT31, and DR antigen. Eight percent of the leukocytes were too blastoid to be classified as atypical lymphocytes of infectious mononucleosis (IM). The blastoid lymphocytes and the duration and degree of the lymphocytosis and hypergammaglobulinemia appeared inconsistent with IM, whereas the EBV serology indicated either EBV primary infection or a secondary alteration of normal seropositive EBV immunity. The genomic analysis of T-cell receptor beta chain in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at admission with a C beta probe did not show a monoclonal rearrangement. EBV genome was detected in these cells, using the BamHI W and K probe, but not in the cells after discharge. Analysis of the EBV terminal repeat junctional sequence, using Xho I fragment of the latent membrane protein (LMP) probe binding with the terminus, did not show monoclonal or oligoclonal populations. EBV-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA) was detected in 36% of the PBMC at admission, but not in the later cells. These EBNA-positive cells were found to form rosette with sheep erythrocytes. The PBMC of six acute IM patients contained neither EBV DNA nor EBNA-positive cells. The observations in this case show a unique type of EBV infection in T cells that has not been previously reported.\r"

There was a positive association between HCV antibody and the presence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen and antibody to human immunodeficiency virus. A group of 31 patients were tested twice for HCV antibody at intervals of 35 to 71 months. In this subset, 25 were repeatedly seropositive, 4 were repeatedly seronegative, and 2 went from seropositive to seronegative. These data confirm the previous impression that non-A, non-B hepatitis is a major sequela to the use of pooled coagulation factor concentrates. HCV infection may account for most of the chronic liver disease observed in this population. Anti-HCV testing of plasma donors and improved methods of viral inactivation should prevent new cases from developing.\r"

  ".W": "Purified bacterially synthesized recombinant murine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was injected in varying doses for up to 2 weeks into adult DBA/2 and C3H/HeJ mice. At high doses (2 micrograms, three times daily) LIF exhibited toxic effects seen as behavioral changes, loss of body fat, and thymus atrophy. Dose-related rises were observed in blood platelets, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, and serum calcium to albumin ratios, including dose schedules with no toxic effects. LIF induced a decrease in bone marrow cell numbers, particularly in marrow lymphocytes, and a moderate increase in spleen weight with a reduction in spleen lymphocytes and an elevation of erythroid populations. LIF-injected mice showed a rise in megakaryocytes up to twofold in the marrow and fivefold in the spleen, with an associated 10-fold rise in megakaryocyte progenitor cells in the spleen. Comparable rises in other types of progenitor cells were also observed in the spleen. The observed changes indicate the biologic activity of LIF in vivo and are consistent with the known wide range of in vitro actions of this molecule. The ability of LIF to elevate megakaryocyte and platelet levels suggests a potential clinical application of LIF in the treatment of thrombocytopenias.\r"

  ".W": "In the fall of 1959 the American Cancer Society began a comprehensive epidemiologic investigation of more than one million men and women drawn mainly from the middle-class population. The study reported here presents a portion of the investigation relating to the mortality among 49,469 subjects who attained age 75 years and older during the course of the study. Both men and women who at entry into this study (1960) were judged to be in good health registered distinctly lower mortality than those judged to be in poor health. Men and women with some college education had significantly lower death rates than those with lesser schooling. Men and women who reported a good family history of longevity showed consistently lower death rates in each five-year age group than those with average or poor family history of longevity. Persons with an average family history of longevity generally had lower death rates than those with a poor family history of longevity. Analysis of mortality by cause indicated that at ages 75 and older nearly half the deaths were attributed to all forms of heart disease. Coronary heart disease accounted for about 35 percent of all deaths, with the proportion decreasing with age. Deaths from stroke rose from 15 to about 20 percent with increase in age. Deaths from all sites of cancer declined with advancing age in both sexes, from about 16 percent of all deaths at ages 75 to 79 to about six percent at ages 90 to 99. Among men, cancer of the prostate accounted for 3.5 percent of deaths at ages 75 to 84, decreasing to about one half this proportion in the early-90s age group. Colorectal cancer decreased from about three percent of total deaths at ages 75 to 84 to about 1.5 percent in the early 90s. Lung cancer and stomach cancer remained at the same level at these ages.\r"

This economic model was based on current international HIV seroprevalence data, Canadian immigration statistics and estimates of disease progression. Between 343 and 862 of the immigrants were estimated to have been HIV seropositive; with the use of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the Western blot technique 310 to 780 of them would have been correctly identified as being seropositive, and 33 to 82 would have been incorrectly classified as being seronegative. Another 16 would have been falsely classified as being seropositive. There would have been 151 to 379 cases of AIDS from 1988 to 1998 among the immigrants identified as being HIV-positive. The estimated total cost of screening would have been $3.3 to $3.4 million. The in-hospital costs of treating HIV-infected immigrants in whom AIDS developed between 1989 and 1998 would have been $5.0 to $17.1 million. Accordingly, screening would have saved $1.7 to $13.7 million over the 10 years after immigration. However, we do not advocate screening on the basis of economic analysis alone and acknowledge that any policy regarding such screening must also incorporate social, legal and ethical considerations.\r"

Factor VII or Factor X deficiencies also developed in several of these patients. Three of these patients experienced chemotherapy-related cardiac, hepatic, or pulmonary toxicity. It is believed by many that endothelial cell injury may be the underlying lesion responsible for these various organ system toxicities seen in the setting of ABMT, although direct evidence of this is lacking. It is proposed that the factor deficiencies described in this report may be an additional consequence of endothelial cell injury or dysfunction. These coagulation factor deficiencies may therefore serve as both a marker to follow these organ system toxicities with and as a useful tool to better study and understand the mechanisms underlying these events. Additionally, deficiencies of either Factor VII or Factor X developed in several patients that were of a sufficient magnitude such that factor replacement therapy would be indicated before any invasive procedures or in the event of significant hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "In quantitative analysis of repeated coronary angiograms, a variable vasomotor tone of the epicardial coronary arteries may influence the accuracy of the results. Therefore, we evaluated the extent and reproducibility of coronary artery dilation with nitrocompounds. In 32 patients with coronary artery disease, the vasodilatory response of angiographically normal coronary segments to different nitrocompounds was analyzed with the computer-assisted contour detection system CAAS. Twenty patients received 5 mg or 10 mg of isosorbide dinitrate sublingually. After 10 to 15 min, a maximal diameter increase was measured with an average of 16 +/- 11% (5 mg: P less than 0.01) and 28 +/- 13% (10 mg: P less than 0.001) from control. Another 12 patients received 0.025 mg per kg body weight of SIN-1, the active metabolite of molsidomine, as an intravenous infusion over 5 min. A comparable maximal dilation (29 +/- 5%; P less than 0.001) occurred after 10 to 15 min and could not be enhanced further with 0.8 mg nitroglycerin administered sublingually (28 +/- 7%; n.s.). One hour after square root of Sin-1, coronary dilation was still 24 +/- 8% (P less than 0.001 compared with control), and 0.8 mg of nitroglycerin sublingually reestablished the previous maximal dilation of 28 +/- 8%. We conclude that high doses of nitrocompounds induce a reproducible maximal coronary dilation that eliminates a substantial source of error in quantitative analysis of repeated coronary angiograms. At present, sublingual administrations of either 10 mg isosorbide dinitrate once or 0.8 mg nitroglycerin repeatedly seem to represent the easiest practicable modes to achieve maximal coronary vasodilation for an adequate period.\r"

The population with prior bypass and unstable angina has not been specifically evaluated. This report reviews the results of angioplasty of 45 vessels in 34 patients with medically refractory unstable angina and at least one prior bypass heart surgery. Of these 34 patients, 32 had rest angina; 14 had resting electrocardiographic changes, all 34 were on aspirin 325 mg QD, 31 were on a calcium blocker, 22 were on a beta blocker, 9 were on intravenous nitroglycerin, and 5 required intraaortic balloon counterpulsation for temporary stabilization. Angioplasty of a vein graft was attempted in 17 patients; the left internal mammary was attempted in 4 patients; 24 native coronary arteries in 15 patients were attempted; 3 of the native arteries were protected left main arteries. Of the LIMA angioplasties, 3 were successful; in the 1 unsuccessful case, the occluded anterior descending artery was opened. Of the 17 vein grafts, 16 were successful: 1 had an acute occlusive syndrome and went to surgery with a balloon pump and bail out catheter; his recovery was uneventful. Of the 24 native artery angioplasties, 22 were successful: one patient was technically unsuccessful in the only vessel attempted; he went to semiemergent surgery and recovered uneventfully. In the other, a right coronary lesion was successfully dilated, but an occluded anterior descending artery was not opened.

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) completely reverses norepinephrine-induced afferent arteriolar (AA) vasoconstriction. In the present study we characterized the effects of ANP on pressure-induced vasoconstriction of AA. Chronic unilateral hydronephrosis was induced to facilitate direct visualization of the renal microcirculation. Hydronephrotic kidneys were perfused in vitro, and AA diameters were measured during stepwise alterations in renal arterial pressure. Increasing renal arterial pressure from 80 to 180 mm Hg decreased AA diameter by 22 +/- 2% (from 18.5 +/- 1.0 to 14.4 +/- 1.0 microns, p less than 0.005). In the presence of 100 nM ANP [human ANP-(4-28)], AA vasoconstricted by 23 +/- 4%, indicating that ANP failed to modify the pressure-induced AA vasoconstriction. Furthermore, both nitroprusside (10 microM) and 8-bromoguanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (30 microM) only partially inhibited pressure-induced AA vasoconstriction (31 +/- 5% and 47 +/- 7%, respectively), whereas these vasodilators completely abolished norepinephrine-induced AA vasoconstriction. In contrast, nifedipine completely inhibited pressure-induced AA vasoconstriction. In summary, pressure-induced AA vasoconstriction is insensitive to the action of ANP, is relatively refractory to cyclic GMP-mediated vasorelaxation, but is completely inhibited by calcium channel blockade. Furthermore, since ANP completely abolishes norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction but fails to affect pressure-induced vasoconstriction, it is apparent that the type of underlying vasoconstrictor stimuli constitutes a major determinant of the renal microvascular response to ANP.\r"

Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA revealed that all G-protein genes except Gi alpha 1 were expressed in the ventricle of Syrian hamsters. Gs alpha and Gi alpha 2 genes were abundantly expressed. The expression levels of the Gs alpha and Gi alpha 2 messenger RNAs in Bio14.6 ventricles were lower than the levels in ventricles of the F1B hamster strain; the abundance of Go alpha and Gi alpha 3 messenger RNAs did not change markedly. Moreover, the messenger RNA levels of Gs alpha and Gi alpha 2 decreased as the stage of cardiomyopathy progressed. Since G-proteins are linked to adenylate cyclase, these alterations of G-protein messenger RNA levels may be related to reduced contractility of cardiomyopathic heart.\r"

In a rat model of arterial injury, we have measured the expression of PAs by vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) during entry into the growth cycle (0-24 hours) and subsequent migration from the media to the intima (starting at approximately 4 days). In normal rat carotid, low levels of urokinase-type PA (uPA) and tissue-type PA (tPA) are present; after removal of the endothelium, only uPA is detected in the media. uPA activity in extracts of carotid arteries increases and reaches a maximum between 16 and 24 hours after injury; uPA mRNA increases steadily and is maximal at 7 days. tPA activity appears at 3 days and is maximal at 7 days; tPA mRNA is present in normal vessels and reaches a maximum by 7 days. Most of the tPA in the media is associated with SMC and not with regenerating endothelium. Furthermore, tPA is present in the media before the SMCs migrate into the intima. These results demonstrate that PA expression by vascular SMCs is differentially regulated, with uPA present during mitogenesis and tPA during migration.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) promotes pulmonary edema by neutrophil-dependent effects on the pulmonary vasculature. The isolated guinea pig lung was perfused with phosphate-buffered Ringer's solution with or without human neutrophils. The infusion of neutrophils (9 x 10(6) total) into lungs isolated after the in vivo administration of TNF (3.2 x 10(5) units/kg) resulted in weight gain (+1.951 +/- 0.311 g versus -0.053 +/- 0.053 g in control) and an increase in the lung (wet-dry)-to-dry weight ratio (8.3 +/- 0.5 versus 6.0 +/- 0.2 in control), indicating the formation of pulmonary edema. The neutrophil-dependent pulmonary edema induced by TNF was associated with a combination of increased capillary permeability (capillary filtration coefficient [Kf,c], 0.170 +/- 0.048 g/min/cm H2O/g at 30 minutes versus 0.118 +/- 0.008 g/min/cm H2O/g at baseline) and increased pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc, 12.8 +/- 0.8 cm H2O at 60 minutes versus 6.0 +/- 0.3 cm H2O at baseline). The Ppc increase was mediated by thromboxane A2 (TXA2) because the TXA2 synthetase inhibitor Dazoxiben (0.5 mM) prevented the effect (Ppc, 6.7 +/- 0.6 cm H2O at 60 minutes with Dazoxiben), and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) levels were increased in the pulmonary venous effluent (5,244 +/- 599 pg/ml at 60 minutes versus 60 +/- 13 pg/ml at baseline). Studies using WEB-2086 (37 microM), a platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonist, indicated that PAF mediated the increased vascular permeability (Kf,c, 0.107 +/- 0.014 g/min/cm H2O/g at 30 minutes using WEB-2086) and, in part, the increased Ppc (Ppc, 8.4 +/- 0.7 cm H2O at 60 minutes using WEB-2086). In addition, alterations of endothelial peripheral actin bands were noted after TNF administration. The data indicate that TNF induces neutrophil-dependent pulmonary edema associated with increased Ppc (mediated by TXA2 and PAF), increased Kf,c (mediated by PAF), and changes in endothelial peripheral actin bands.\r"

This distribution of vascular resistance can be altered in a nonuniform manner by a variety of physiological (autoregulation, increases in myocardial oxygen consumption, sympathetic stimulation) and pharmacological stimuli (norepinephrine, papaverine, dipyridamole, serotonin, vasopressin, nitroglycerin, adenosine, and endothelin). Studies of exchange of macromolecules in the microcirculation using fluorescent-labeled dextrans have also identified the size of the small pore (35-50 A) in coronary microvessels that can be altered by myocardial ischemia. Studies of the coronary microcirculation have demonstrated that the control of vascular resistance is extremely complex, and mechanisms responsible for these heterogeneous responses need further examination.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown that renal responses to atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are markedly attenuated in patients with heart failure. This study aimed to determine if vasodilative response to ANP is altered in patients with heart failure. In patients with heart failure (n = 7) and age-matched normal subjects (n = 7), forearm blood flow was measured using a strain-gauge plethysmograph during intra-arterial infusion of alpha-human ANP (50, 100, 200, and 400 ng/min) or nitroglycerin (100, 200, 400, and 600 ng/min). Forearm vasodilatation evoked with intra-arterial alpha-human ANP in patients with heart failure was considerably less (p less than 0.01) than that in normal subjects. In contrast, nitroglycerin produced comparable forearm vasodilatation in the two groups. Plasma ANP and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) levels at rest were higher in patients with heart failure than in normal subjects (p less than 0.05 for both), but the increases in plasma ANP and cyclic GMP in the venous effluents during intra-arterial ANP infusion did not differ between the two groups. These results indicate that the direct vasodilative effect of ANP on forearm vessels was attenuated in patients with heart failure as compared with that in normal subjects. The mechanisms responsible for this alteration are not clear but might involve mechanisms other than down-regulation of the ANP receptors because the increases in venous plasma cyclic GMP caused by intra-arterial ANP were comparable between patients with heart failure and normal subjects.\r"

To extend these studies in vivo, we tested whether inhibition of clot or fibrin-bound alpha 2-antiplasmin by MAb RWR could enhance the lysis of a human clot by tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in a rabbit jugular vein thrombosis model. Compared with a saline placebo or a control antibody, MAb RWR significantly increased thrombolysis by endogenous plasminogen activator in rabbits to which no t-PA was administered (p less than 0.05). In rabbits that received t-PA, the combination of MAb RWR and t-PA caused significantly greater thrombolysis than equivalent doses of t-PA alone (p less than 0.05). However, compared with equipotent doses of t-PA alone, the combination of MAb RWR and t-PA did not increase the nonspecific consumption of fibrinogen. These experiments suggest that the combination of an alpha 2-antiplasmin inhibitor and a plasminogen activator could be a more potent thrombolytic strategy.\r"

Thrombus formation was elicited by electrolytic injury with a needle electrode to the endothelial surface of the circumflex coronary artery in the open-chest, anesthetized dog in the presence of a flow-limiting critical stenosis. Thirty minutes after spontaneous coronary artery occlusion, t-PA (1 mg/kg i.v. over 90 minutes) was administered.

Group 4 received t-PA plus bitistatin, and reperfusion occurred at 51.8 +/- 8.5 minutes; however, the reperfusion incidence was only 60% (6/10). In groups 1, 2, and 4, acute reocclusion occurred in more than 80% of the reperfused dogs, whereas in group 3 reocclusion occurred in 22% (2/9) of the reperfused dogs (p less than 0.05 versus group 1).

  ".U": "90305092\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the platelet inhibitory effect of high doses of fish oils and relate it to alterations in eicosanoid synthesis, we used a canine model in which coronary thrombosis, the time to reperfusion induced by recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), and the rate of spontaneous reocclusion are sensitive to platelet inhibition. In the animals fed fish oil, the time to rt-PA induced thrombolysis was accelerated (mean, 63 vs. 27 minutes; p less than 0.003). The time to thrombotic occlusion and the rate of reocclusion were unaltered. The ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to arachidonic acid rose in platelet and endothelial cell membranes, whereas serum thromboxane (Tx) B levels fell a mean 86%, and basal excretion of 2,3-dinor-TxB2 (TxA2-M) declined. Basal prostaglandin (PG) I2 formation was unaltered, whereas biosynthesis of EPA-derived TxA3 and PGI3 increased. In control animals, TxA2 formation increased during thrombosis; there was a further, more marked rise during reperfusion. PGI2 formation also increased, probably as a response to platelet-vascular interactions. Stimulated production of both eicosanoids was strikingly suppressed in the animals fed fish oil. Fish oils significantly enhance the efficacy of rt-PA in vivo, albeit to a modest extent. Because the time to reperfusion is highly sensitive to Tx-dependent platelet activation, this effect is likely to reflect the demonstrated suppression of TxA2 biosynthesis by fish oils.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were designed to determine the action of neutral endopeptidase inhibition (NEP-I), an inhibitor of the degradation of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), in congestive heart failure (CHF). Studies were conducted in two groups of anesthetized dogs with CHF induced by 8 days of rapid right ventricular pacing. Group 1 (n = 5) received a specific NEP-I (SQ 28,603) at two doses administered sequentially -30 mg/kg followed by a 60 mg/kg i.v. bolus. Group 2 (n = 5) received intravenous infusion of exogenous ANF (100 ng/kg/min) to achieve increases in plasma ANF concentration as observed in group 1. NEP-I resulted in a diuresis and natriuresis (p less than 0.05) with increases in the fractional excretion of sodium and fractional excretion of lithium, the latter a marker for proximal tubule sodium delivery. Such tubular actions occurred in the absence of increases in glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow but were associated with significant increases in urinary ANF and urinary cyclic GMP. Plasma ANF increased after the 30 mg/kg NEP-I dose. In contrast, in group 2 with exogenous ANF and despite a marked increase in plasma ANF, no natriuresis was observed. Arterial pressure did not change in either group. These studies demonstrate for the first time in CHF that NEP-I may potentiate the natriuretic action of endogenous ANF by a mechanism that is independent of systemic or renal hemodynamics and does not parallel increases in plasma ANF. These studies support an important therapeutic role for NEP-I in CHF.\r"

  ".U": "90305102\r", 
  ".W": "Flecainide and other class IC antiarrhythmic drugs are effective in the prevention and termination of atrial fibrillation, but the mechanism of this action is unknown. To gain insights into potential cellular mechanisms, we evaluated the response of human atrial action potentials to equimolar therapeutic concentrations of flecainide and quinidine and compared this response to that of guinea pig, rabbit, and dog atria. Both compounds reduced Vmax more as activation rate increased, but flecainide was more potent than quinidine and had slower kinetics. The rate-dependence of Vmax reduction was similar for all species, but human tissue was more sensitive to the drugs tested. In contrast to changes in Vmax, drug-induced alterations in action potential duration showed opposite rate-dependence for the two drugs. Quinidine increased action potential duration to 95% repolarization (APD95) in human atria by 33 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD) at a cycle length of 1,000 msec, but this effect was reduced as cycle length decreased, to 12 +/- 4% (p less than 0.001) at a cycle length of 300 msec. Flecainide increased APD95 (by 6 +/- 3%) much less than quinidine at a cycle length of 1,000 msec, but its effect was increased by faster pacing, to 27 +/- 12% at a cycle length of 300 msec and 35 +/- 8% (p less than 0.001) at the shortest 1:1 cycle length. The rate-dependent response of APD to drugs was qualitatively similar but quantitatively different among species. Human tissue showed the greatest frequency-dependent drug effects on repolarization, followed by tissue from dogs and rabbits. Guinea pig atria showed the least (and statistically nonsignificant) rate-dependence of drug effect on APD. Drug-induced changes in refractoriness paralleled those in APD. We conclude that: 1) flecainide and quinidine both increase APD in human atrial tissue but with opposite rate-dependence, 2) the effects of flecainide to increase atrial APD and refractoriness are enhanced by the rapid rates typical of atrial fibrillation, and 3) animal tissues may differ importantly from human in both their sensitivity and rate-dependent response to antiarrhythmic drugs. The salutary response of atrial fibrillation to flecainide may be due to enhancement of drug action by the rapid atrial activation rates characteristic of this arrhythmia.\r"

Flecainide (10 microM) markedly reduced IK elicited on depolarization steps to plateau voltages (+10 mV) and nearly completely blocked the \"tail currents\" elicited on repolarization to -40 mV (93 +/- 4% block at +40 mV, n = 3). E-4031 (1 microM) produced similar effects (96 +/- 3% block at +40 mV, n = 3). Slow voltage ramps from -100 to +40 mV confirmed inward rectifying properties of IK and showed that flecainide and E-4031 have no effects on the background potassium current, IK1. Thus, the results demonstrate that block of IK is a common feature of flecainide and E-4031. IK block by E-4031 most likely underlies the drug's potent class III antiarrhythmic properties. On the other hand, flecainide block of IK during an action potential would tend to prolong repolarization, but this effect may be obscured by concomitant block of plateau Na+ channels to produce little or no change in action potential duration, consistent with its class IC classification.\r"

Four patients (44%) died during the observation period, three from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) contracted through contaminated Factor VIII plasma concentrates and one from sudden cardiac arrest. One of the patients who died from AIDS had a positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at surgery. He died three months after the arthroplasty. The remaining two patients contracted AIDS one year and four years after the arthroplasty. All but one patient were followed for at least one year, with an average follow-up period of 43 months. Using The Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Rating Scale, the overall result was excellent in nine knees and good in three knees. All patients were completely relieved of pain. TKA in hemophiliacs is an effective treatment for otherwise intractable chronic knee pain due to severe joint degeneration. However, caution should be taken in HIV-positive patients owing to the challenge of the patient's immune system and the risk of transmitting the virus to the hospital staff.\r"

Patients between 19 and 64 yr (young) were compared with those between 65 and 74 yr (young-old) and with those greater than or equal to 75 yr (old-old) with respect to utilization of nutritional support (total parenteral nutrition [TPN]), mechanical ventilation (MV), pulmonary artery (PA) catheterization, dialysis (D), and blood products (B). Mean length of stay (LOS) in the ICU, primary diagnosis, outcome, and average daily severity of illness scores (ADTIS) were also compared. Old-old patients represented 14% of all ICU patients and young-old patients represented 28%; 64% of old-old and 61% of young-old patients had solid tumors, compared with 36% of younger patients. The ICU mortality of the two older groups was significantly lower than that of the younger patients (17%, 27%, and 30%, respectively). The use of TPN, PA catheters, and D was similar for all three groups, but older patients used less MV and B than the younger patients (p less than .0001, chi2 analysis).

This effect can be inhibited by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor piroxicam, suggesting arachidonic acid metabolites as mediators. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate stimulates increases in prostaglandin E2 release and mucosal 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate content in intact mucosa. Stimulation of prostaglandin E2 release appears to come mainly from the subepithelial compartment and not from epithelial cells. Unlike its effect on anion secretion, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate inhibition of sodium uptake by sodium-hydrogen exchange in isolated mature villus enterocytes is not inhibited by piroxicam. This study concludes that phorbol ester effects on anion secretion in chickens appear to be mediated by arachidonic acid metabolites most likely produced by cells of the lamina propria and submucosa, whereas phorbol ester effects on inhibiting upper villus cell sodium-hydrogen exchange may be a direct effect of phorbol esters.\r"

  ".W": "ABH antigens are expressed by colonic epithelial cells throughout the colon during fetal life but only in proximal segments during adulthood. Malignant and premalignant colonic tumors frequently exhibit ABH reappearance (distal lesions) or ABH deletion (proximal lesions) and occasionally express incompatible A or B substances. Mechanisms governing these developmental and cancer-associated alterations are unknown. Therefore, experiments were performed to assess the activities of biosynthetic (glycosyltransferase) and degradative (glycosidase) enzymes in normal and cancerous tissues of the proximal and distal colon. In normal colonic mucosa, A, B, and H transferase activities were similar in proximal and distal segments. Analysis of enzyme substrate affinities and product characterization confirmed that the ABH transferases in colonic tissues were similar to the gene-specified transferases in human serum. Glycosidase enzyme activities were also comparable in proximal and distal normal colon. Cancers had lower A and B transferase but similar H transferase activities compared with paired normal mucosa. Thus, the absence of ABH antigen expression in normal distal colon is not caused by insufficient glycosyltransferase activity or excessive glycosidase activity.\r"

  ".U": "90306705\r", 
  ".W": "It is generally accepted that biliary secretion is rate-limiting for the plasma-to-bile transport of a saturating load of bilirubin. Previous studies from this laboratory have suggested a relationship between the hepatic bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase activity and the apparent maximal rate of bilirubin secretion (excretory transport maximum). The present study was undertaken to further investigate this relationship in rats with a wide range of transferase levels and to analyze the effects of transferase activity on the formation of bilirubin monoglucuronides and diglucuronides in vivo and in vitro. Animals with moderately decreased enzyme activity still showed a near-normal excretory transport maximum but decreased fractional amounts of conjugated bilirubins in plasma and liver and a decreased ratio of bilirubins diconjugates to monoconjugates in bile, liver, and plasma. A more pronounced decrease in the level of transferase activity yielded lower excretory transport maximum values as well. Enhanced transferase activities were obtained by pretreatment with a series of enzyme-inducing agents, usually at dosages not influencing bile flow. An enhanced transferase activity produced significant increases in bilirubin excretory transport maximum, decreased concentrations of both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubins in plasma, and an increased ratio of diconjugates to monoconjugates in bile and in liver. In all animals, the ratio of disconjugates to monoconjugates observed in bile was correlated with the ratio found after incubation of liver homogenates in vitro at low concentrations of bilirubin substrate. Overall, the relationship between bilirubin excretory transport maximum and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase activity can best be described by a hyperbolic curve. At \"saturation\" of the excretory transport maximum values, no increase of conjugates in liver or in plasma could be observed, suggesting that not the biliary secretion, per se, but rather the conjugation rate in vivo is rate-limiting. The latter seems lower than the in vitro assayed enzyme activity. The present investigations point to an equilibration of bilirubin pigments between plasma, liver, and bile. The in vivo conjugation rate can be estimated from the in vitro assay (but not at high enzyme activities) and determines the maximal biliary secretion rate, the ratio of diconjugates to monoconjugates in the three compartments studied, and the relative amount of conjugates in plasma. Our studies suggest that the conjugation rate in vivo rather than the biliary secretion step is the major determinant of the maximal bilirubin secretion rate.\r"

Serious complications occurred in 95% of the patients and 50% of the subjects died. Aspiration was the most common adverse event and accounted for all deaths. Ten of 15 subjects (67%) treated with a PEJ to prevent aspiration continued to aspirate after the catheter was placed. PEJ tube failures were documented in 14 subjects (70%) and occurred because of occlusion, leakage, malposition, extrusion, cracking, kinking, or rupture of the catheter. These problems rendered the PEJ nonfunctional 18% of the time. Large manpower and resource investments were required to manage the PEJ and its complications. Our results suggest that enteral feeding through a PEJ does not prevent aspiration. Serious PEJ-related morbidity (95%), mortality (50%), and catheter failures (70%) occur. Refinements in methodology and catheter design will be required before additional use of this technique can be recommended.\r"

We reviewed the records of 191 patients who underwent placement of PEG/J tubes. Data collected included incidence of tube dysfunction, need for tube replacement or removal, and aspiration after PEG or PEJ tube placement. Tube dysfunction, defined as peritube leakage, plugging, fracture, or migration, occurred in 36% of patients over a mean follow-up period of 275 days and was significantly more common and likely to necessitate tube replacement in PEJ patients. Tube trade-out or removal and aspiration within a 30-day period after tube placement occurred in 28% and 10% of patients, respectively. These complications were significantly more common in PEJ patients than in PEG patients. Because of the increased incidence of tube dysfunction and the failure to prevent aspiration in predisposed patients, PEJ tube placement is not routinely indicated in patients requiring tube feedings.\r"

However, it is not yet known whether natural human serum albumin binds to hepatitis B virus under physiological conditions. We studied the binding between natural or recombinant HBsAg and monomeric human serum albumin by immunological, biochemical and biophysical methods. The binding capacity of 20-nm HBs spheres was variable but ranged up to six molecules HSA/sphere. A reversible binding site for human serum albumin was exclusively localized in the preS2 domain, whereas the S domain was inactive in vitro. Human serum albumin copurified with HBsAg of human origin during gel chromatography or sucrose-gradient centrifugation. This human serum albumin was monomeric in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The preS2-bound part of the human serum albumin could be removed from HBsAg by high-salt, such as CsCl centrifugation, but another part could only be removed by treatment with a disulfide cleaving reagent. Most of this covalently bound human serum albumin was retained at the HBsAg particle after complete cleavage of medium-sized HBs protein with trypsin. This indicates a second way in which albumin binds irreversible to cysteine(s) of the small HBs protein (SHBs, P24 and GP27).\r"

  ".W": "The cellular oncogene c-jun is transiently expressed in cultured cells stimulated to proliferate but has not been identified in normal liver. Because partial hepatectomy results in coordinated cell proliferation in the remaining liver, we investigated c-jun expression after partial hepatectomy in mice. Northern analysis of whole liver mRNA demonstrated a transient increased expression of c-jun within half an hour of the operation. The related gene junB increased only 50%, whereas c-jun expression increased 13-fold compared with sham-operated controls. To determine the cell of origin of the c-jun transcript, both in situ hybridization and Northern analysis of mRNAs from parenchymal and nonparenchymal cell fractions were performed 2 hr after partial hepatectomy. C-jun expression was found in both cell populations. To investigate the mechanism of increased c-jun expression, cycloheximide was given to some animals preoperatively. C-jun induction occurred with cycloheximide alone, but partial hepatectomy further increased c-jun expression, indicating that new protein synthesis was not required for this effect. Furthermore, run-on transcriptional assay demonstrated a twofold increase in c-jun expression. Thus c-jun expression increases after hepatectomy by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Because the extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme transin, which bears the recognition site for jun/AP-1, showed sustained induction after hepatectomy, we speculate that an important function of c-jun expression could be the remodeling of extracellular matrices to accommodate cell proliferation.\r"

Time courses of fever, neutrophilia and low blood-zinc levels generally attributed to cytokines were quantified after partial (67%) hepatectomy of rats under ether anesthesia. These acute phase responses in hepatectomized rats were compared with those after intravenous injection of exogenous endotoxin and human natural interleukin-1. Fever commenced 30 min after interleukin-1 injection, 4 hr after exogenous lipopolysaccharide injection and 6 hr after 67% liver resection. Similarly, rectal temperatures were significantly elevated in recipient rats 30 min after intravenous administration of donor plasma from hepatectomized animals, indicating that cytokines, not lipopolysaccharide, elicited the febrile response. Neutrophilia was present 1, 2, and 4 hr after interleukin-1 injection, lipopolysaccharide injection and hepatectomy, respectively. Furthermore, the reduction in plasma zinc, which depends on cellular metallothionein synthesis, occurred 4 hr after interleukin-1 administration and 6 hr after lipopolysaccharide injection or partial hepatectomy. Donor plasma from hepatectomized rats also elicited neutrophilia at 1 hr and low blood-zinc levels 4 hr after injection in recipient animals. The timing of these responses, just as for the fever, implies that cytokines and not lipopolysaccharide in the donated plasma elicited the neutrophilia and hypozincemia. Evidence was reviewed that interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 function as hepatotrophic factors and have been identified in the circulation of humans with liver damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both treatments were maintained for 24-hr. The hemostatic efficacy according to the intention to treat was 86.5% for tamponade and 66% for pharmacological therapy (p less than 0.01). No significant differences were found with respect to rebleeding during the first 72 hr after treatment, mortality rate or side effects.

SHR showed no age-related change in the natriuretic response to ANF, whereas adult WKY rats exhibited a greater response than young WKY rats. To determine the effect of renal perfusion pressure on the magnitude of the renal response to ANF, additional groups of 6- and 11-week-old SHR were studied while renal perfusion pressure was lowered acutely by aortic constriction (SHR-AC) to values similar to age-matched WKY rats. In young rats, the diuretic and natriuretic response to ANF was greatest in SHR, intermediate in SHR-AC, and lowest in WKY rats. In adult animals, the natriuretic and diuretic response was similar in SHR and WKY rats and tended to be less in SHR-AC. These results in both 6- and 11-week-old SHR are consistent with previous reports that the magnitude of the response to ANF is directly related to acute changes in renal perfusion pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found that two clotting tests, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and activated clotting time (ACT) can be easily used to assess the safety of anticoagulant treatment (therapeutic ranges: APTT from 55 to 95 sec and ACT from 170 to 220 sec). A certain degree of coagulation activation, despite heparin, was indicated by the constant finding of thrombin-antithrombin complexes, while fibrinolytic activation, measured as plasminogen activator activity, was confined to the time of bypass connection and was of no clinical consequence. Platelet function was always impaired without relation to the platelet loss. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (13 episodes) and severe bleeding (11 episodes) were major complications. DIC was corrected with a good outcome for 8 of 13 patients, while severe bleeding was correlated with a poor outcome in 8 of the 11 patients, probably because of the severity of the underlying disease.\r"

The cases of these patients were reviewed to ascertain whether access to both acetabular columns during the same procedure facilitates open reduction and internal fixation and to determine the indications for this combined procedure. As determined by intraoperative assessment and at follow-up examination four to thirty-two months postoperatively, anatomical reduction and rigid fixation were achieved in 88 per cent of the patients. No patient had an infection of the wound. All twenty-four patients had some degree of heterotopic ossification; as defined by Brooker et al., it was Class I in seven, Class II in thirteen, Class III in three, and Class IV in one. However, the heterotopic ossification limited motion of the hip enough to impair function in only two patients. We concluded that combined anterior and posterior exposures facilitate reduction and fixation and that these approaches should be used during the same period of anesthesia whenever anatomical reduction and rigid internal fixation cannot be achieved through a single exposure. Heterotopic ossification should be expected postoperatively, but it is rarely clinically important, at least in the short term.\r"

  ".W": "To document the in vivo interactions occurring between the immune system and HIV replicating cells, we analyzed using in situ hybridization the production of IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-2, and INF-gamma in eight hyperplastic lymph nodes from HIV-1 infected patients. Numerous IL-1 beta- and IL-6-producing cells associated in clusters were detected in sinuses. Few individual IL-1 beta- and IL-6-producing cells were present in interfollicular and follicular areas. IL-2- and INF-gamma-producing cells were observed in all lymph node compartments, with a selective enrichment in germinal centers. The amount and distribution of IL-1 beta, IL-6-, and IL-2-producing cells in HIV lymph nodes were not different from those found in six HIV unrelated hyperplastic lymph nodes. In contrast, a higher level of INF-gamma production was observed in HIV-1 lymph nodes. The CD8+ cells that accumulate in germinal centers of HIV lymph nodes (and not in non-HIV germinal centers) were actively involved in this INF-gamma production. INF-gamma synthesizing cells were in direct contact with cells containing HIV core antigens and HIV RNA. Thus a high INF-gamma production may characterize anti-HIV T cell immune response, potentially contributing to control of viral spreading as well as to the development of follicle lysis.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the role of growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone (GRH) and somatostatin (SRIH) in the regulation of the growth hormone (GH) secretory pattern, we collected portal blood from five unanesthetized ovariectomized ewes for repeated measurements of GRH and SRIH simultaneous with those of peripheral GH. Hormones were measured at 10-min intervals for 5.5 h and their interrelationships analyzed. Mean portal GRH was 20.4 +/- 6.7 (SD) pg/ml and the estimated overall secretion rate was 13 pg/min. GRH secretion was pulsatile with peaks of 25-40 pg/ml and a mean pulse interval of 71 min. Mean portal SRIH was 72 +/- 33 pg/ml and the estimated overall secretion rate was 32 pg/min. SRIH secretion was also pulsatile with peaks of 65-160 pg/ml and a mean pulse interval of 54 min. The GH pulse interval was 62 min. A significant association was present between GRH and GH secretory peaks though not between GRH and SRIH or SRIH and GH. Insulin hypoglycemia resulted in a rapid and brief stimulation of SRIH secretion followed by a decline in GH levels. No effect was observed on GRH secretion until 90 min, when a slight increase occurred. The results suggest (a) the presence of an independent neural rhythmicity of GRH and SRIH secretion with a primary role of GRH in determining pulsatile GRH secretion, and (b) that the inhibitory effects of insulin hypoglycemia on GH in this species are attributable to a combination of enhanced SRIH secretion and possibly other factors, though without significant inhibition of GRH.\r"

  ".W": "Despite numerous reports, the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) function remains controversial. We found TNF to be a potent, pertussis toxin-independent stimulator of PMN adhesion (ED50 2.6 pM). TNF-stimulated PMN under adherent conditions released up to 65% of their transcobalamine content (ED50 3.9 pM) and increased their burst activity 10-fold (ED50 3.2 pM) as measured by the hexose monophosphate shunt, whereas PMN held in suspension hardly degranulated at all and only little burst activity was demonstrable. However, preincubation of PMN with TNF in suspension led to a decrease in cellular adhesiveness, degranulation, and burst activity in response to a secondary stimulus of TNF under adherent conditions, although cells remained fully responsive toward phorbol myristate acetate. A concomitant dose-dependent decline of TNF receptor numbers that correlated well with the inhibition of PMN function (r = 0.91) suggests receptor down-regulation as the mechanism of functional PMN deactivation. Remarkably, preincubation with other PMN stimuli such as N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, platelet-activating factor, leukotriene B4, complement component fragment 5a (C5a)/C5a (desarginated), and endotoxin also led to a reduction of TNF-specific PMN responses (cross-deactivation) from 35% (LTB4) to 90% (endotoxin), corresponding with the down-regulation of TNF receptors. Deactivation and receptor down-regulation are independent of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and protein kinase C but seemed to depend on changes in calcium metabolism. Granulocyte hyporesponsiveness towards TNF in sepsis (with elevated blood levels of endotoxin and TNF) might be a mechanism of self-protection or, to the contrary, might impair a possibly central mode of host defense.\r"

  ".W": "Cytochrome P450 content and activities are increased in the kidneys of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as compared with those of normotensive, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY), control rats during the period of rapid elevation of blood pressure. We studied the effect of heme arginate, a potent inducer of heme oxygenase (EC 1.14.99.3), on microsomal cytochrome P450 levels and activities and blood pressure in SHR at 7 wk of age. Administration of heme arginate (15 mg/kg body weight for 4 d) resulted in a marked decrease in blood pressure from 156.3 +/- 4.7 to 129.8 +/- 4.5 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), whereas blood pressure in SHR receiving the vehicle control was not affected. The blood pressure of age-matched WKY was not affected by heme arginate. Heme oxygenase activity increased in both hepatic and renal microsomes of SHR and WKY by two- to four-fold after treatment with heme arginate. Maximal increase of heme oxygenase mRNA occurred 5-7 h after the last injection of heme arginate and returned to control levels after 24 h. The increase in heme oxygenase activity was associated with a parallel decrease in cytochrome P450 content and in the activity of cytochrome P450 omega/omega-1 arachidonate hydroxylases in kidneys of SHR. It is postulated that heme arginate treatment resulted in induction of heme oxygenase which consequently led to a diminution of cytochrome P450, especially the arachidonate omega/omega-1 hydroxylases leading to a marked decrease in 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 20-HETE. The effect of heme arginate on blood pressure may be mediated via these biochemical events inasmuch as both 19-HETE and 20-HETE produced by the kidney may promote hypertension by causing vasoconstriction and sodium retention.\r"

  ".U": "90307976\r", 
  ".W": "Neutrophil elastase has been implicated as a factor that impairs local host defenses in chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF). We recently showed that this enzyme cleaves the C3b receptor, CR1, from neutrophils (PMN) in the lungs of infected CF patients. The C3bi receptor on these cells, CR3, is resistant to elastase. We now show that purified neutrophil elastase markedly impairs complement-mediated PMN-Pa interactions including phagocytosis of opsonized Pa, stimulation by opsonized Pa of PMN superoxide production, and killing of opsonized Pa by PMN. When PMN and opsonized Pa were treated separately with elastase, additive levels of inhibition were observed in each of the above assays. The effects on the bacteria were due to cleavage of the bound C3bi from the surface of opsonized Pa by neutrophil elastase. C3bi was also cleaved by pseudomonas elastase, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from CF patients with chronic Pa lung infection. Inhibitors of neutrophil elastase eliminated C3bi cleavage by BAL fluid, while inhibitors of pseudomonas elastase had no effect. Blocking CR1 and CR3 on PMN with specific monoclonal antibodies reduced phagocytosis of opsonized Pa to an extent similar to that caused by elastase cleavage of CR1 on PMN and C3bi on Pa. We conclude that neutrophil elastase in the lungs of chronically infected CF patients cleaves C3bi from opsonized Pa as well as CR1 from PMN, creating an \"opsonin-receptor mismatch\" that severely impairs complement-mediated phagocytic host defenses against these bacteria.\r"

PGF2 alpha infusion in anesthetized rats resulted in a significant increase in plasma immunoreactive (ir) ANP levels in vivo despite effecting only modest changes in hemodynamics. The PGs were also effective at promoting irANP secretion in primary cultures of neonatal rat atrial and ventricular cardiocytes. PGF2 alpha increased irANP release with half-maximal induction seen at approximately 10(-8) M; PGE2 was somewhat less effective and prostacyclin (PGI2) was without effect. The PGs also increased ANP mRNA levels in these cells, suggesting that these agents exert a major effect on the synthesis as well as the secretion of the prohormone. Transient expression analysis of atrial cells transfected with 2,500 bp of human (h) ANP 5' flanking sequence linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter demonstrated that PGF2 alpha (10(-5) M) increased hANP promoter activity approximately twofold relative to the control. PGF2 alpha had no effect on the promoterless control (pSV0-lamin CAT). Treatment of cultured atriocytes with high concentrations of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor resulted in a significant suppression of ANP secretion in vitro and a truncation of the plasma ANP response to volume infusion in vivo. Taken together these studies support a role for PGs as regulators of cardiac ANP synthesis and secretion, and suggest an additional mechanism whereby eicosanoids may act to control cardiovascular and renal homeostasis.\r"

These results, the reproduction of the response with glucose/glucose oxidase and with exogenous H2O2, and the lack of effect of preincubation with deferoxamine or thiourea implicate H2O2, and not O2- or OH., as the important reactive oxygen metabolite altering intestinal electrolyte transport. 1 mM H2O2 stimulated colonic PGE2 and PGI2 production 8- and 15-fold, respectively, inhibited neutral NaCl absorption, and stimulated biphasic electrogenic Cl secretion with little effect on enterocyte lactic dehydrogenase release, epithelial conductance, or histology. Cl- secretion was reduced by cyclooxygenase inhibition. Also, the Cl- secretion, but not the increase in prostaglandin production, was reduced by enteric nervous system blockade with tetrodotoxin, hexamethonium, or atropine. Thus, H2O2 appears to alter electrolyte transport by releasing prostaglandins that activate the enteric nervous system. The change in short circuit current in response to Iloprost, but not PGE2, was blocked by tetrodotoxin. Therefore, PGI2 may be the mediator of the H2O2 response. H2O2 produced in nontoxic concentrations in the inflamed gut could have significant physiologic effects on intestinal water and electrolyte transport.\r"

A questionnaire was tested for reliability and validity, then mailed to 1,168 nutrition support dietitians. Results of the survey indicated that, more often than nurses or physicians, dietitians were responsible for calculating nutrient and fluid needs, selecting formula, determining the home feeding schedule, teaching the patient to prepare blenderized formulas, and teaching the patient to recognize formula intolerance. Dietitians were less often responsible than nurses for psychomotor skills such as teaching the patient to administer the formula, operate the pump, and flush the feeding tube. Dietitians seemed to have a larger role in hospitals with more than 499 beds, in teaching hospitals, and in hospitals with a nutrition support team. Dietitians reported a smaller role when they reported to a contract foodservice company and when their job duties were divided so that more time was spent in clinical dietetics than in nutrition support. However, dietitians in all demographic groups performed all tasks. The average amount of dietitian time spent preparing patients for discharge on home enteral feeding was 168 minutes (2.8 hours) per patient. More patients received gastric feedings (76%) than intestinal feedings (22%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The family of the multihandicapped child had been isolated by the child's feeding problems and viewed the problems as barriers to his entering school. Components of a nutrition care plan for an interdisciplinary team included oral feeding readiness, nutritional adequacy and timing of meals, and mechanical aspects of gastrostomy feeding in the classroom. Nutrition interventions were adjusted for the classroom from those used in the home or clinical setting. The major activity in the transition program was behavioral management of the child's rumination, which affected nutritional status and feeding. The major outcome of the transition program was enrollment of the child in school, with gastrostomy feeding as a routine activity. A transition program for a gastrostomy-fed child is an appropriate mechanism for expanding the role of the nutritionist into the classroom.\r"

  ".W": "Transduction through the CD23 molecule (Fc epsilon RII) was analyzed in human activated B lymphocytes using anti-CD23 mAb. B cell blasts expressing an increased amount of surface CD23 molecule were obtained by stimulation of normal peripheral blood B lymphocytes with Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I and IL-4. Anti-CD23 mAb were found to trigger polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis in these cells (and also in tumoral B cells expressing spontaneously CD23) and a rise in [Ca2+]i which could be attributed to mobilization from cytoplasmic pools. This increase in [Ca2+]i could be mimicked, with a comparable time-course, by the addition of InsP3 to permeabilized B cell blasts indicating that the increase in inositol phosphate accumulation induced by the antibodies was due to a preferential attack of phosphatidylinositol-bisphosphate by a specific phosphoinositidase C (PIC). In permeabilized cells, raising the free calcium concentration above 3 microM was found to induce polyphosphoinositides hydrolysis and to activate directly the PIC. Addition of 100 microM GTP-tetralithium salt, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP, also resulted in an increased accumulation of inositol phosphates. A Ca2(+)-dependent PIC, linked to a GTP-binding protein (Gp protein), can thus be activated in B cell blasts. Addition of anti-CD23 antibodies to permeabilized B cells in the presence of a physiologic concentration of Ca2+ (100 nM) evoked, within 10 min, a rise in the various inositol phosphates. This ability of anti-CD23 antibodies to activate PIC was enhanced in the presence of GTP-tetralithium salt 100 microM. By contrast, preincubation with GDP-trilithium salt, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GDP, caused a marked reduction in the release of inositol phosphates. Preincubation of B cell blasts with Pertussis toxin resulted in a total inhibition of the capacity of the toxin to ADP-ribosylate a 41-kDa protein, probably of the Gi type; in these conditions, no modification of anti-CD23-elicited polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis could be detected. These results suggest that the CD23 molecule may be coupled to the phosphoinositide signaling pathway by a GTP-dependent component that is insensitive to Pertussis toxin.\r"

However, there is considerable controversy concerning the precise role of cAMP in this regard or the target of its action. A number of studies with cAMP analogs or forskolin have implicated the early events after ligand binding as being particularly susceptible whereas others have failed to do so or offered alternate targets. We have examined the effects of cell permeant analogs of cAMP and forskolin on human T cell proliferation. After brief exposure to submitogenic concentrations of PHA or phorbol ester plus ionomycin, we have examined the effects of increased cAMP levels during initial activation (or induction of competence) and progression to DNA synthesis. We find that these drugs that inhibit T cell proliferation have little effect on induction of competence or early activation events including transmembrane Ca2+ uptake, release of Ca2+ from internal stores or induction of the genes encoding c-fos or early growth response gene. In contrast, it is the progression phase of the proliferative response which appears to be the major target for cAMP-protein kinase A-mediated inhibition of human T cell proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "The vast majority of circulating lymphocytes that express the alpha,beta TCR in association with CD3 also express either CD4 or CD8 molecules, which are thought to act as important accessory structures in HLA class II- and I-restricted T cell functions, respectively. In the current study alpha,beta TCR+ clones devoid of detectable CD4 or CD8 were generated by repeated stimulation of fresh CD3+,CD4-,CD8- cells with an allogeneic lymphoblastoid cell line in the presence of conditioned medium containing IL-2. Except for the absence of CD4 and CD8, which was associated with undetectable levels of CD4 and CD8 mRNA, the clones were phenotypically indistinguishable from classical CD3+,alpha,beta TCR+ cells. Furthermore, they mediated potent cytolysis of their specific stimulator line but did not kill irrelevant LCL or NK-sensitive targets. mAb to CD3 and the alpha,beta TCR inhibited cytolysis, suggesting that the clones use the TCR/CD3 complex to recognize and respond to their targets. mAbs to CD2 and CD11a also inhibited cytolysis, indicating that the clones use these accessory molecules to interact with their targets. Finally, cytolysis was inhibited by an HLA-A,B,C framework-specific mAb (W6/32) as well as a mAb (MA2.1) specific for an HLA-A2 epitope. These results demonstrate that CD3+,alpha,beta TCR+,CD4-,CD8- cytotoxic clones can be generated from the peripheral blood of healthy adults, and use their TCR/CD3 complexes to function in an HLA class I-restricted manner.\r"

  ".W": "To determine IL-2 requirement for activation of suppressor cells, PBMC were primed in one-way MLR in the presence of 10 micrograms/ml anti-IL-2R beta-chain antibody 2A3 (CD25) or control antibody, then irradiated and added as regulators in a fresh MLR. Cells primed in the presence of antibody 2A3 suppressed the proliferative response to fresh autologous lymphocytes to specific alloantigen but had no effect on the response to cells from third party donors. Priming in the presence of an antibody of irrelevant specificity induced only limited suppressor activity. Activated suppressor cells did not show cytolytic activity specific for the stimulators when tested at the time of the suppressor cell assay. To identify the subset(s) responsible for suppression, cells primed in the presence of antibody 2A3 were separated into CD4+/CD45RA+, CD4+/CD45RA-, and CD8+ subsets, which were irradiated and then tested. The suppressive activity was found predominantly in the CD4+/CD45RA+ subset, whereas CD8+ cells had some activity and CD4+/CD45RA- cells had none. No subset suppressed the response of autologous cells to third-party cells. When primed CD4+/CD45RA+ cells were cocultured with fresh autologous lymphocytes depleted of CD8+ cells, no suppression was observed, indicating that, although the CD4+/CD45RA+ cells can function as inducers of suppressors, they cannot function as suppressor-effectors. Conversely, CD8+ cells activated in MLR in the presence of 2A3 caused suppression, regardless of whether the fresh autologous responder population contained CD8+ cells. CD4+/CD45RA+ and CD8+ subsets isolated after priming in the presence of 2A3 also demonstrated Ag-specific suppression in the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes whereas CD4+/CD45RA- cells had no activity. Our data are consistent with the model that suppression of alloreactivity requires the cooperation of two types of cells, a CD4+/CD45RA+ suppressor-inducer and a CD8+ suppressor-effector population. Activated Tsi and fresh Tse or activated Tse alone can suppress lymphocyte proliferation and generation of CTL in response to specific Ag. Activation of Ag-specific T suppressor-inducer and T suppressor-effector cells appears to be relatively IL-2 independent and presumably require one or more other growth factors.\r"

Sequential appearance of host- and donor-derived T cells occurred in the thymus of both AKR----B6 and B6----AKR chimeras in which 5 x 10(6) of T cell-depleted BM cells were used to reconstitute recipients lethally irradiated with 950 rad. Thymocytes bearing V beta 6 high, which recognize MHC class II IE-binding Ag encoded by Mls-1a allele, were detected in neither host- nor donor-derived thymocytes of AKR-B6 chimeras in which Mls-1a and IE were expressed only by the BM-derived cells. Thymocytes bearing V beta 11high capable of recognizing IE were also deleted in the host- and donor-derived thymocytes of the AKR----B6 chimeras. One million of BM cells were inadequate to deletion of the B beta 6high and V beta 11high T cells in the host-derived thymocytes of these chimeras. On the other hand, significant number of V beta 6high and V beta 11high thymocytes were detected in both the host- and donor-derived thymocytes in B6----AKR chimeras where sufficient dose of IE- stem cells were used to reconstitute irradiated Mls-1aIE+ recipients. These results suggest that clonal deletion of the host- and donor-reactive T cells in both the host- and donor-derived thymocytes is an important mechanism for the induction of transplantation tolerance in allogeneic BM chimeras and that BM-derived APC may be essential for the intrathymic elimination of both the host- and donor-reactive T cells in the BM chimeras.\r"

Although the underlying mechanisms are still undefined, T cells and particularly CD4+ lymphocytes seem to play a crucial role in the initiation of collagen-induced arthritis. To investigate whether CD8+ cells may participate in the pathogenesis of the disease, we have generated lines and clones of cytotoxic T cell hybridomas reactive to CII by fusion of lymph node and spleen cells from bovine native CII-primed C3H.Q (H-2q) mice and the AKR-derived thymoma cell line BW 5147. Clones were selected for their ability to lyse syngeneic macrophages pulsed with bovine native CII in an Ag-dependent manner. The two hybrid clones that were characterized, exhibited cell surface phenotypes of cytotoxic cells and reacted with CII purified from various species. However, each of them recognized different determinants on the CII molecule. P3G8 clone was specific for an epitope shared by CII and type XI collagen, whereas P2D9 clone reacted with CII and type IX collagen. Both hybridomas recognized CII-pulsed targets in association with H-2Kq molecules. These data indicate that the two CII-specific cytotoxic clones recognize different epitopes that are shared by other articular collagens and will allow us to test their influence on the development of arthritis in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90308290\r", 
  ".W": "Syngeneic graft-versus-host disease (SGVHD) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease occurring postsyngeneic bone marrow transplantation and the administration of the potent immunosuppressive agent, cyclosporine A. Paradoxically, cyclosporine A disrupts the immunologic homeostasis governing self-tolerance. Our studies using an adoptive transfer model attempted to identify effector mechanisms associated with the autoimmune disease. Both CD4+ and CD8+ splenic T cells isolated from autoimmune donors were required for the adoptive transfer of active disease into lethally irradiated secondary recipients reconstituted with normal bone marrow. Doses of more than 5 x 10(6) of nylon wool depleted splenocytes from autoimmune donors effectively transferred disease into lethally irradiated secondary recipients. Splenocytes that are T cell depleted or CD4(+)-enriched cells did not elicit disease upon adoptive transfer. Nylon wool fractionated CD8+ splenocytes also failed to adoptively transfer disease unless high doses (greater than or equal to 30 x 10(6)) were used. The disease transferred with the CD8+ subset presented as acute type SGVHD and was self-limiting. The recombination of the individually isolated T cell subsets not only restored but also enhanced immune reactivity upon adoptive transfer. Moreover, use of the recombined subsets resulted in progressive disease with the development of chronic type SGVHD. The titration of each subset to the other suggested that a minimal number of CD4+ T cells was required to potentiate the CD8+ autoreactive cells in vivo. Further analysis of the helper cell involved demonstrated that it had a CD4+ CD45r- phenotype, characteristic of an amplifying helper cell population. Administration of IL-2 did not substitute for CD4+ Th cells but yet amplified the activity of unfractionated cells or recombined subsets implicating the role of other factors in the pathogenesis of SGVHD. Delineation of the effector mechanisms involved in SGVHD is critical in determining the underlying events that trigger either the production of autoreactive cells or the perturbation of the regulation of these autoreactive cells, culminating in autoimmunity.\r"

  ".W": "We have demonstrated that IL-4 markedly inhibits IL-1 production by highly purified normal human monocytes. When added to monocyte cultures, IL-4 suppressed LPS-induced IL-1 production in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Concentrations of IL-4 as low as 100 pg/ml reduced IL-1 production by approximately 50%, and doses of 1 ng/ml or higher suppressed IL-1 production by more than 90%. Maximal inhibition required that IL-4 be added before or simultaneous with LPS. Northern dot blot analyses revealed that IL-4 not only dramatically reduced the steady-state IL-1 beta mRNA levels in LPS-stimulated monocytes, but also those of TNF-alpha and IL-6. The inhibitory effect was not stimulus-specific because IL-4 suppressed IL-1 production induced by a variety of monocyte activation stimuli, including LPS, PMA, and Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain. Monocytes expressed a relatively small number of high affinity IL-4R (approximately 150/cell; Ka = 3.15 +/- 1.13 x 10(10) M-1) indicating that relatively few receptors are necessary to generate the inhibitory effect. IL-4 enhanced monocyte MHC class II Ag (HLA-DR) expression in a manner similar to that of IFN-gamma. However, although both IFN-gamma and IL-4 up-regulated HLA-DR expression, they exhibited opposite effects on IL-1 production: IFN-gamma significantly enhanced monocyte IL-1 production induced by submaximal concentrations of LPS; whereas, IL-4 suppressed IL-1 production. Moreover, IL-4 largely neutralized the potentiating effect of IFN-gamma suggesting that IL-4 may be an effective antagonist of certain IFN-gamma-induced effects. Together these findings demonstrate that the relative levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4 may profoundly influence the state of monocyte activation by differentially regulating the expression of IL-1.\r"

  ".W": "A growing body of literature suggests that a variety of cell products (e.g., cytokines, C components, etc.) likely play an important role during inflammation and host defense by locally regulating the diverse functions of recruited (i.e., immunologic cells) as well as tissue cells. Previously, a number of investigations have demonstrated the ability of immunologic cells to produce C components in vitro, and further studies have identified a variety of cytokines that can regulate C component production by these cells. Recently, we have demonstrated the ability of lung tissue cells, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts, to synthesize and secrete numerous C components and complement regulatory proteins in vitro. Additionally, we have demonstrated that C component production can be modulated by a variety of factors including endotoxin and serum. In our studies we investigated the effects of specific cytokines, i.e., IL and IFN, on the production of the third (C3) and fifth (C5) C components by the continuous cell line of human type II pneumocytes (A549). Specifically, using sensitive ELISA we demonstrated that A549 pneumocytes exposed to IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, or IL-2 induced a dose-dependent, more than twofold, increase in C3 production and a 50% decrease in C5 production when compared to control (untreated) A549 cells. Interestingly, IFN-alpha significantly decreased both C3 and C5 production, i.e., 38 and 71%, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. IFN-gamma had no effect on C3 production, but significantly decreased C5 production by A549 pneumocytes by 84%. These data not only demonstrate that cytokines have the capability to modulate C3 and C5 production by human type II pneumocytes in vitro, but that C3 and C5 production by these cells can be regulated independently by different cytokines. In vivo, cytokine modulation of C component production by local tissue cells likely plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation and host defense within the lung.\r"

Sialidase-treated C5 used as a reagent for the titration of C6, C7, C8, and C9 resulted in increased titers of all these components compared to buffer-treated C5. As determined by a fluorometric method, ca. 65% of the SA was enzymically hydrolyzed under optimal conditions. Endoglycosidase F incubated with C5 followed by monosaccharide analyses by anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection revealed both high mannose and complex (terminate in SA) oligosaccharides were hydrolyzed; no effect was found on the functional activity of C5. Approximately 4% of the complex oligosaccharides were hydrolyzed from C5. Comparison of sialidase- and buffer-treated C5 decay rates from EAC1gp(4b,oxy2a,3b)hu resulted in two linear components of the decay curve with sialidase-treated C5, but one linear component with buffer-treated C5.

The mechanism of increased hemolytic activity after removal of SA from C5 is: the Tmax is prolonged at 30 degrees C (ca. 15 min vs 9 min), and a higher percentage of C5 binds to cellular intermediates compared to buffer-treated C5.\r"

We have previously shown that PTx activates the same signal transduction pathways as Ag or mAb directed against the CD3-T cell Ag receptor complex in human T cells. Because the EC50 for mitogenic stimulation by PTx was 1.7 nM, we suspected that the toxin was specifically interacting with a membrane protein or receptor. We have used both chemical cross-linking and Western blotting techniques to demonstrate that PTx shows specific binding to a 43 kDa-membrane protein on cells that respond to PTx by rapid second messenger production. The PTx receptor can be detected in both the E6-1 Jurkat cell line and a CD3-TCR-negative Jurkat line, demonstrating that it is not coordinately expressed with the Ag receptor complex. The 43 kDa-protein is also found in the HPB-ALL human T cell line and PBL, but not in a murine T cell hybridoma or human neutrophils, both of which are unresponsive to PTx activation. These data suggest that the biochemical basis for the mitogenic activity of PTx may lie in its binding to a specific membrane receptor that is capable of transmitting an activation signal.\r"

Inasmuch as protein kinase C has been suggested to mediate several of these responses, we have examined the effects of IFN-gamma exposure on subsequent accumulation of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG). Exposure of murine macrophages to IFN-gamma (greater than 4 h) results in an increase in basal DAG as well as potentiating DAG accumulation in response to the macrophage chemoattractant, platelet-activating factor (PAF). An increased DAG accumulation was similarly observed in response to PMA and ionomycin. Our results further indicate that the increased DAG accumulation during activation of macrophages is unlikely to involve alterations in phosphatidylinositol metabolism. PAF-stimulated production of [3H]inositol phosphates was not altered by the prior exposure of macrophages to IFN-gamma. Similarly, IFN-gamma did not potentiate the ability of PAF to cause an increase in cytosolic calcium. Our data indicate that phosphatidylcholine metabolism may be involved in IFN-gamma-regulated DAG accumulation. Exposure of [3H]choline-labeled macrophages to IFN-gamma resulted in an increase in the basal level of aqueous [3H]choline metabolites as well as potentiating the production of [3H]choline in response to PAF, PMA, and ionomycin. Our results thus suggest that the potentiated protein kinase C-mediated responses occurring during macrophage activation may be due to potentiated DAG accumulation independent of potentiated phosphatidylinositol metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "90308313\r", 
  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that reactive oxygen intermediates may play a role in the etiology of cartilage matrix degradation in arthritis. We have previously established that normal articular chondrocytes can functionally act as macrophages. These functions include expression of class II MHC Ag, presentation of Ag and induction of mixed and autologous lymphocyte stimulation. Inasmuch as the production of reactive oxygen intermediates is a hallmark of macrophage activity during inflammatory response, we were interested in examining the ability of normal articular chondrocytes to produce reactive oxygen intermediates. Using the trapped indicator 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA), we measured the levels of intracellular hydrogen peroxide within normal rabbit articular chondrocytes. We found that Concanavalin A induces chondrocytes to rapidly oxidize 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate to a highly fluorescent dichlorofluorescin in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Fluorescent dichlorofluorescin oxidation by chondrocytes was inhibited by the addition of catalase, an enzyme that detoxifies hydrogen peroxide. Exposure of rabbit chondrocytes to either IFN-gamma or TNF primed the chondrocytes to produce significantly greater amounts of hydrogen peroxide with or without further stimulation. Using scopoletin oxidation as a measure of the release of hydrogen peroxide, we confirmed that chondrocytes released this reactive oxygen intermediate after adherence to serum coated culture plates. Rabbit articular chondrocytes produced and released greater amounts of hydrogen peroxide than pulmonary alveolar macrophages, a well characterized macrophage cell type. These observations suggest that chondrocytes are an important source of reactive oxygen intermediates. Furthermore, the production of reactive oxygen intermediates by chondrocytes may be an important mechanism by which chondrocytes induce structural and functional alterations in cartilage matrix observed during arthritis.\r"

  ".W": "Several previous reports have described the surprising inability to detect murine CTL specific for glycoprotein D (gD), one of the important protective immunogens of HSV. Using slight variations of published procedures, we were able to show that the immune response to HSV in infected mice includes the generation of CTL specific for gD. C3H/OuJ (H-2k) mice were infected by injection in the hind footpads with purified HSV-1. Lymphocytes from draining lymph nodes were then isolated and shown to proliferate in response to, and to kill, transformed fibroblasts (H-2k) expressing HSV-1 gD. Two gD-specific T cell clones were isolated. One clone, designated CGD1, was shwon to be CD8+. This clone recognizes HSV-1 gD, but not HSV-2 gD, in the context of class I MHC molecules and kills the appropriate MHC-matched fibroblasts expressing HSV-1 gD. Unusual features of this cytolytic clone include augmentation by IL-4 of proliferative responses to Ag, inhibition of its lytic activity by a mAb specific for Thy-1 and recognition of infected fibroblasts in preference to infected lymphoblasts. The other clone, designated CGD3, was shown to be CD4+. This clone recognizes both HSV-1 gD and HSV-2 gD in the context of class II MHC molecules and has cytolytic potential.\r"

In the present study lymphoproliferation, IL-2 production, utilization, and IL-2R display were examined in splenic lymphocytes of infected mice. The L3T4+ subset was the major SEA-specific proliferative population at both stages of the infection. Chronic infection spleen cells or the L3T4+ subset proliferated less compared with their acute infection counterparts. Elimination of the Lyt-2+ subset did not improve diminished proliferation. Chronic infection cells and the Lyt-2+ subset stimulated with SEA and exogenous rIL-2 regained their proliferative ability to a level comparable with acute infection cells. Ag-stimulated acute infection T cells produced 40 to 50 chronic infection cells less than 5 U/ml IL-2. Elimination of L3T4+ T cells diminished, and the Lyt-2+ T cells left unchanged IL-2 production in the acute infection cells. Elimination of Lyt-2+ subset from the chronic infection population did not enhance IL-2 production. Exogenously added rIL-2 was equally utilized by acute or chronic infection T cells. Scatchard plots of [125I]IL-2 binding showed similar numbers of high affinity receptors on acute (189) and chronic infection cells (118), but the number of low affinity receptors was higher on the acute (2229) vs the chronic infection lymphocytes (578). Analysis of IL-2R expression by two-color fluorescence and flow cytometry revealed that 30 to 40% of the acute, chronic infection L3T4+ cells displayed receptor. Receptor expression increased by added SEA, or SEA + rIL-2. R display among Lyt-2+ cells was only 12 to 18%. SEA stimulation enhanced receptor display more among the acute, SEA + rIL-2 stimuli raised receptor expression only among chronic infection lymphocytes. These data do not show inherent defect in IL-2R display, or utilization in chronic infection T cells. Diminished IL-2 production appears to be the cause of decreased T cell responsiveness.\r"

The analysis of Abelson murine leukemia virus transformed cells that rearrange the kappa-locus during growth in cell culture has provided the opportunity to characterize intermediate steps in Ig gene rearrangement. By sequential cloning of an Abelson murine leukemia virus transformed cell line we have observed a novel two-step pathway that results in a rearrangement of a V kappa gene segment into the J-C kappa intron. This type of rearrangement effectively excludes functional kappa expression from that allele. A truncated mRNA product resulting from the V kappa signal exon splicing to the C kappa exon is diagnostic of these unique rearrangements. In addition to demonstrating a novel mechanism for allelic exclusion, the two-step pathway described serves to explain how V-intron recombination products were generated in previously described cell lines.\r"

Among various anti-Id that were typed serologically as internal image Ab2 of the mouse mammary tumor virus tumor-associated Ag gp52, only one induced protective immunity and was effective in immunotherapy. In this study we compared the structural, idiotypic, and network properties of the protective and nonprotective antiidiotypic antibodies. The DNA sequence of the variable regions of six anti-Id was determined. The VH sequence of four Ab2, including the protective Ab2, are highly homologous, whereas the VL sequences differ and were assigned to different Vk families. In addition, the DH sequence region of the same four Ab2 are identical, whereas one is highly homologous and another one without homology. Search for amino acid sequence homologies between the Ab2 and gp52 showed the strongest similarities in the CDR2 of the L chain from the protective Ab2. In addition, the CDR2 region also had homology with a T cell epitope on gp52. The biologic basis of effective idiotypic mimicry was studied at the level of Ab3 induced by the Ab2. Id inhibition analysis using Ab3 induced by either protective or nonprotective Ab2, revealed differences. Thus, there is evidence for differences among the Ab1-Ab2-Ab3 cascade induced by protective and nonprotective anti-Id.\r"

By using a modification of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), mu and kappa Ig loci were sequenced from nine Id- variants derived directly by anti-Id immunoselection in vivo. Ig kappa loci sequence analysis was also performed from 10 additional variants amplified directly from tumor cells in vitro without immunoselection. We demonstrate that the molecular mechanism underlying tumor cell escape in this model is the spontaneous emergence of variants that have undergone kappa L chain gene \"re-rearrangement\" before positive selection by the anti-Id antibody. A second round of re-rearrangement was also demonstrated to occur within primary tumor variants. Re-rearrangement of the 38C13 tumor cell Ig kappa locus is strongly biased toward use of variable kappa genes within the conserved V kappa-Ox1 gene family, although their use is not exclusive. With the use of RNA PCR re-rearrangement was documented to occur in vitro at a frequency of approximately 1.0 x 10(-5)/cell. These findings may have important implications for the application of anti-Id antibodies as a therapeutic approach for human lymphomas and for understanding of the Ig gene rearrangement process.\r"

Arachidonic acid (100 microM) was added to the cells which were then stimulated with 1 microM calcium ionophore A 23187 for 10 and 30 min. The supernatants were examined for cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products using different chromatographic systems and radioimmunoassays. Compounds were identified by comparison with authentic standards. The major cyclooxygenase product of both cell types was prostaglandin D2, with minor amounts of prostaglandin E2. The main products of the lipoxygenase pathway were 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), 12-HETE, 15-HETE, and their corresponding hydroperoxy derivatives, with small amounts of leukotrienes B4 and C4. The major differences in the metabolism of the two cell types were related to faster kinetics of generation of the mediators and a more complete conversion of arachidonic acid by the LC. Because eicosanoids have been implicated to be potent mediators of inflammation and immunomodulators, the present data underline the potential contributory role of epidermal cells to eicosanoid-associated pathologic processes.\r"

  ".W": "In order to clarify the biologic significance of carbohydrate processing in tyrosinases for melanogenesis, we have studied the effect of differential carbohydrate processing inhibitors on the recovery process of interrupted melanization which occurs after exposure of cultured B-16 melanoma cells to the inhibitor of core carbohydrate synthesis, glucosamine (Glc). Treatment of this glycosylation-dependent repigmentation process with the early-stage carbohydrate processing inhibitors deoxynojirimycin (dNM), castanospermine (CS), and monensin (MS) at 0.8 mM, 40 micrograms/ml, and 30 nM, respectively, in the presence of 2 mM theophylline (Tp) almost completely inhibits the reappearance of the pigment 48-72 h after removal of Glc. In contrast, treatment with the later stage carbohydrate processing inhibitor swaisonine (SW) at 40-80 micrograms/ml does not interrupt the repigmentation process. Electrophoretic analysis of tyrosinases in the soluble fractions of these melanoma cells demonstrates that the alteration of soluble tyrosinase isozymes by all the processing inhibitors is associated with a dose-dependent loss of sialic acid-rich T1 tyrosinase and the concomitant appearance or increase of sialic acid-poor tyrosinases. In the large granule fraction, a recovery of membrane-bound tyrosinase (T3) is seen following both MS and SW treatments, whereas dNM treatment results in the substantial loss of T3 tyrosinase. At the electron microscopic level, a translocation of tyrosinase from GERL and coated vesicles to many unmelanized vacuolar premelanosomes occurs in MS-treated cells in contrast to its predominant distribution in the GERL-coated vesicle system of dNM-treated cells, which contain many unmelanized premelanosomes. The present evidence for differential effects on intracellular tyrosinase transfer and melanization by different stages of carbohydrate processing inhibition suggests that asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, relating to the first mannose-trimming stages, determine the function of tyrosinase transfer as well as melanization through a specific intracellular recognition process in pigment cells.\r"

T cells extracted from skin lesions of two CTCL patients were cloned by limiting dilution and propagated in interleukin-2 (IL-2) containing medium with periodic lectin stimulation. Twelve T-cell clones were derived from each patient. In both cases, genotypic analysis of the T-cell clones revealed that these clones had T-cell receptor (TCR) beta- and gamma-chain gene rearrangements distinct from the predominant, presumably malignant, clone present in the skin, lymph nodes, or blood. This suggests that they were derived from presumably reactive (non-malignant) T cells. Furthermore, these clones had gene rearrangements different from each other, indicating their multiple clonal origins. The failure to propagate in vitro the CTCL T-cell clone suggests that CTCL cells may have growth requirements different from normal T cells. Thus, conventional T-cell culturing methods using IL-2 and lectins as mitogen may selectively propagate the presumably reactive T cells contained within the skin lesions. The ability to selectively grow these reactive lesional T cells (so-called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) raises the possibility that these cells could be used in adoptive immunotherapy.\r"

A statistically significant clinical improvement was seen in lesions treated with 2% lonapalene ointment as compared with vehicle-treated sites. Although there was a statistically significant reduction in the levels of material similar or identical to the chemoattractant arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase product, leukotriene B4, in skin chamber fluid samples from lonapalene versus vehicle treated lesions, no significant reduction in arachidonic acid or 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid was seen. The reduction in leukotriene B4 equivalents occurred before significant clinical improvement in lesions was seen. This and the selectivity of the pharmacologic response suggest that the therapeutic effect of topical lonapalene in psoriasis might be related to inhibition of leukotriene B4 synthesis. These results support the view that 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of psoriasis, and that leukotriene B4 is a relevant mediator of the pathology of this disease.\r"

Enzyme activity was found both in the particulate (75%) and soluble (25%) fractions of the cell. Membrane-bound tyrosinase was readily solubilized by either zwitter-ionic or nonionic detergents. The anionic detergent, sodium cholate, inhibited enzyme activity. Tyrosinase activity in black foreskin homogenates averaged almost three times that in white skin samples (33.8 pmols 3H2O/h/mg skin in black and 12.71 pmoles 3H2O/h/mg skin in white skin), although considerable overlap in activities existed among the two groups. Tyrosinase activities measured with two separate assays, tyrosine hydroxylase and [14C]melanin assays, were similar, suggesting that tyrosine hydroxylase activity is tightly coupled to melanin synthesis. Tyrosinase activity determined by either assay method generally correlated with skin melanin content. Kinetic analysis of tyrosinase from black and white foreskin revealed a Km for tyrosine of 2.5 X 10(-4) M in both skin types. Immunotitration experiments suggested that the difference in tyrosinase activities between white and black skin may be due, not only to different amounts of enzyme present in the melanocytes, but also possibly to differences in the catalytic activities of the enzyme found in melanocytes of black and white skin.\r"

Renal blood flow distribution was assessed by the xenon 133 freeze-dissection technique and by rubidium 86 extraction after ibuprofen treatment. Ibuprofen (13 mg/kg) significantly decreased TRBF by 16.3% +/- 1.2% (mean +/- SEM electromagnetic flow probe; p less than 0.005), but did not alter blood flows to the outer cortex (3.7 vs 4.3 ml/min per gram), the inner cortex (2.6 vs 2.7 ml/min per gram), and the other medulla (1.5 vs 1.5 ml/min per gram), which suggests a decrease in nonnutrient flow. In a separate group of animals the effect of reduced blood flow on the nutrient and nonnutrient components was determined by mechanically reducing renal arterial blood flow by 48%. Unlike the ibuprofen group, nutrient blood flows were proportionally reduced with the mechanical decrease in TRBF in the outer cortex (1.9 ml/min per gram, p less than 0.05), the inner cortex (1.4 ml/min per gram, p less than 0.05), and the outer medulla (0.8 ml/min per gram, p less than 0.01). These results indicate no shift between nutrient and nonnutrient compartments. Nutrient and nonnutrient renal blood flows of the left kidney were also determined by 86Rb extraction. After ibuprofen treatment, nonextracted 86Rb decreased to 12.1% from the control value of 15.6% (p less than 0.05). Mechanical reduction of TRBF did not significantly decrease the proportion of unextracted 86Rb (18.7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess both urinary excretion of AG by the transplant and the relationship between urine and serum hydrolase activity, acute and chronic acid-base studies were performed in normal control subjects and in the patient with Fabry's disease who had undergone renal transplantation. For the acute studies, alkalosis was induced by intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate and acidosis was induced by ingestion of ammonium chloride. The chronic study involved long-term ingestion of NH4Cl by only the patient with Fabry's disease. The results show that AG is secreted by the renal graft. Urinary hydrolase excretion was increased by acute alkalinization and decreased by acute acidification. Acute, but not chronic, acidification increased the patient's serum AG activity, indicating that long-term acidification is not useful for treating Fabry's disease after transplantation. The large changes in hydrolyase excretion induced by acute and chronic acid-base changes show the difficulty of using lysosomal enzymuria as a diagnostic marker for renal disorders without knowledge of acid-base conditions.\r"

We propose the use of a two-phase linear regression approach, which is tantamount to breaking down the model into two straight lines based on the selection of the logarithm of concentration as the ordinate and time as the abscissa. We show how to determine the joint or changeover point for the two lines using a simple iterative procedure, how to select between a one-phase and a two-phase model, and how to provide a simple confidence interval estimate for half-life when it exists. An example using data from a study of Factor VIII pharmacokinetics is given.\r"

  ".W": "The prostaglandin system is impaired in cholestasis; bile salts, which are a specific biochemical feature of this condition, have been shown to affect functional properties of cells and tissues, and, in some cases, their action is mediated through an alteration of prostaglandin pathway. Endothelium is a privileged site for the production and the action of arachidonate metabolites-prostacyclin in particular. To determine the effects of bile salts on the properties of vascular endothelium, cultured human endothelial cells were studied. Cholic acid sodium salt was seen to induce a direct injury on endothelial cells, as was demonstrated by a massive dismission of the intracellular radiolabel chromium 51. In the absence of detectable toxic effect, sodium taurocholate caused a significant depression of prostacyclin constitutive production from human endothelial cells. The action of sodium taurocholate was related to its concentration and to the time of exposure, and the alteration of prostacyclin production was found to be reversible. Conversely, the generation of thromboxane A2 was not influenced by this bile salt, which may suggest a specific action of sodium taurocholate on arachidonic acid metabolism. These findings indicate that bile salts may directly alter some functional properties of cultured human endothelial cells and may provide a basis for explaining some generalized manifestations that are observed in pathologic conditions characterized by cholemia.\r"

  ".W": "Explants from a glioblastoma multiforme were maintained for 4 weeks in a three-dimensional Gelfoam matrix culture in order to study the synthesis of alpha 2-antiplasmin (alpha 2AP), alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Since the organ culture system promotes cellular differentiation in gliomas with increasing time in vitro, secretion of the proteinase inhibitors and t-PA was examined at weekly intervals. Increased immunohistochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker of astroglial differentiation, was observed in the explants with advancing time in culture. The proteinase inhibitors alpha 2AP and alpha 2M were secreted into the medium in all 4 weeks, while PAI-1 was detected at significant concentrations by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in Weeks 3 and 4 only. The quantity of each inhibitor secreted into fresh medium during a 24-hour interval increased with the age of the tumor explants in the Gelfoam culture system. At no time was a sensitive ELISA able to detect t-PA in the culture medium. This study demonstrates that glioblastoma multiforme cells in primary organ culture can secrete three major fibrinolysis proteinase inhibitors. The appearance of PAI-1 only after extensive culturing of the explants suggests a possible correlation with neoplastic astroglial maturation.\r"

  ".W": "The essential fatty acid (EFA) nutrition of young American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) was examined by feeding a variety of fats/oils with potential EFA activity. Over a 12-wk period, alligators fed diets containing 2.5 or 5.0% chicken liver oil grew longer and heavier and converted feed to body mass more efficiently than alligators fed other fat/oil combinations that lacked or contained only trace amounts of arachidonic acid [20:4(n-6)]. Alligators fed an EFA-deficient diet (containing only coconut fat as the dietary fat) were the slowest-growing animals and converted feed to body mass least efficiently. However, over a 41-wk feeding period, alligators fed this diet showed no obvious external signs of deficiency other than being reduced in size and unthrifty. Fatty acid composition of heart, liver, muscle, skin and adipose tissue lipids was influenced markedly by dietary fat composition. Tissues varied significantly in response to dietary fat composition. Heart lipids contained the lowest levels of short- and medium-chain fatty acids and the highest levels of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid levels were less influenced by diet than were levels of other 20- and 22-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids. Radiotracer studies indicated that linoleic acid was converted to arachidonic acid in the liver. Nevertheless, tissue arachidonic acid levels also appeared to be maintained by concentration from dietary sources and selective conservation. It appears that a dietary source of arachidonic acid may be required for a maximum rate of growth.\r"

  ".W": "The rate and extent of oxidation of 20 different amino acids has been evaluated as part of a study on partitioning of amino acids in normal lactating cows. Only four amino acids--glutamate, aspartate, alanine and glutamine--were extensively oxidized, and when expressed as a percentage of the injected dose oxidized during 3 h after intravenous injection, the value for these four amino acids was not significantly different from those obtained with the volatile fatty acids. The oxidation of all other amino acids was significantly slower, effectively prolonging their availability for protein synthesis. The pattern of oxidation among the amino acids supports the hypothesis that catabolized protein can provide a protracted source of anaplerotic precursors that augment the metabolic role of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and would have survival advantage in both acute and chronic exigencies. Glutamate and aspartate provide the earliest and largest influx to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with alanine and, especially, glutamine appearing to serve as reservoirs of amino-nitrogen. Several dispensable amino acids are metabolized as slowly as the indispensable ones, indicating that metabolic conservation is not restricted to the latter group.\r"

HIV+ men were divided into two groups based on peripheral blood CD4/mm3 of greater than 500 or less than 500. CD4+ cells that were simultaneously CD45R-, CDw29-, and 13- were significantly less in HIV+ men with less than 500 CD4/mm3 (17%) compared to heterosexual men (34%). This lower percentage of \"CD4 only\" cells in HIV+ males with less than 500 CD4/mm3 correlated with a significantly higher percentage of CD4+ cells that were CD45R+, CDw29+, and 13+ in these individuals. CD8+ cells that were CD45R+, 13+, but CD38-, were significantly less in HIV+ men with less than 500 CD4 as compared to HIV- homosexual men. In contrast, a second CD8+ subpopulation that was CD45R-, CD38+, and either 13+ or 13- was significantly greater in less than 500 HIV+ men as compared to both HIV- homosexual men and heterosexual men. A significant difference in this subpopulation was observed between the less than 500 and greater than 500 HIV+ groups and correlated with seropositivity for viral p24 antigen. Interestingly, CD8+ cells that were CD45R+, as well as CD38+, and either 13+ or 13- were significantly greater in the less than 500 HIV+ group compared to the greater than 500 HIV+ group, and did not correlate with p24 seropositivity. The percentage of monocyte/macrophages that were CD4- or expressed dim CD4 immunofluorescence, but were 13+, was significantly greater in HIV+ men (43%) compared to HIV- homosexual men (27%). In summary, we have identified previously undescribed mononuclear cell subpopulations that were altered with HIV infection and, in some cases, correlated with the stage of disease.\r"

  ".W": "An elevated plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is characteristic of congestive heart failure (CHF) in both humans and animals. One strategy for facilitating the biological actions of this circulating hormone is to inhibit its metabolism. Neutral endopeptidase 24.11, an enzyme known to degrade ANP, has been implicated in the metabolic clearance of this hormone. Inhibition of endopeptidase 24.11 may produce increases in the local concentrations of ANP in organs rich in the enzyme, such as the kidney, thereby enhancing local actions, e.g. natriuresis. Exogenous administration of ANP to CHF patients produces limited natriuresis, perhaps because of the associated fall in arterial pressure. This approach of blocking endopeptidase 24.11 activity in CHF could offset the general effects of exogenous administration of ANP and result in enhanced natriuresis. We therefore undertook studies to determine if thiorphan, an endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor, would increase circulating ANP levels and enhance natriuresis in conscious cardiomyopathic hamsters with CHF. Cardiomyopathic hamsters had significantly lower (P less than .05) basal mean arterial pressures in comparison to normal hamsters (90 +/- 2 vs. 135 +/- 3 mm Hg). Treatment with thiorphan (10 mg/kg i.v. bolus followed by 10 mg/kg/hr i.v. infusion) did not change arterial pressure in either group and produced a 3-fold increase in urinary sodium excretion in the cardiomyopathic group but not in the normal hamsters. This natriuretic response in the cardiomyopathic hamsters was associated with a doubling of the plasma concentration of ANP. These results indicate that inhibition of endopeptidase 24.11 increases natriuresis and circulating ANP concentrations in this model of CHF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In dog renal artery strips with intact and damaged endothelium, relaxations induced by angiotensin II possibly mediated via the release of prostaglandin (PG) I2 were abolished or reversed to contractions by treatment with methylene blue and indomethacin. Relaxations elicited by arachidonic acid were also inhibited markedly. PGH2-induced contractions in the arteries with endothelium were potentiated, and relaxations caused by PGH2 in the endothelium-denuded arteries were suppressed by methylene blue, whereas these responses were not influenced by indomethacin. Relaxant responses to PGI2 and beraprost, a stable analog of PGI2, were not reduced by methylene blue. The amount of 6-keto PGF1 alpha in the bathing media released from the renal artery was decreased by treatment with methylene blue and indomethacin, whereas amounts of PGE2 and thromboxane B2 were not influenced by methylene blue but were reduced by indomethacin. It may be concluded that methylene blue interferes with the synthesis and release of PGI2 in the dog renal arteries; therefore, the relaxation mediated by endogenous PGI2 is suppressed. However, methylene blue does not appear to inhibit the synthesis of other cyclooxygenase products.\r"

  ".W": "The isolated perfused rat heart releases atriopeptin-28 [AP28 (ANF99-126)], whereas the storage form of AP in the heart is the intact prohormone AP126 (ANF1-126). Right atrial stretch or phenylephrine (5 x 10(-5) M) stimulated the release of AP28. The processing of the prohormone during stretch was inhibited by infusion of the protease inhibitor aprotinin, resulting in the appearance of intact AP126 in the cardiac effluent. Other protease inhibitors including p-aminobenzamidine and soybean trypsin inhibitor did not alter prohormone processing by the isolated heart subjected to stretch. In contrast, aprotinin did not block the prohormone processing induced by phenylephrine. Ca+(+)-free medium markedly inhibited prohormone processing during stretch without a significant effect on AP release, whereas phenylephrine-stimulated AP release was completely suppressed by Ca+(+)-free medium. Exogenous AP126 could be cleaved by isolated rat hearts perfused either with Krebs-Henseleit solution or with Ca+(+)-free medium. However, amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the prohormone cleavage in Ca+(+)-free medium occurred at sites other than between Arg98 and Ser99 and that the resultant low molecular weight APs were not AP28. These findings suggest: 1) the characteristics of the enzyme(s) involved in the processing of AP prohormone in isolated perfused rat hearts are different from the described properties of purified enzymes; 2) in isolated perfused rat hearts the specific AP processing enzyme is Ca++ dependent, whereas nonspecific cleavage does not necessarily require Ca++ and 3) two independent AP processing pathways differentially activated by mechanical (stretch) and pharmacologic (alpha 1-adrenergic agonist) stimuli exist.\r"

The first goal of the present study was to examine effects of acetazolamide on blood flow to the choroid plexus. We measured blood flow (microspheres) and the production of CSF (ventriculo-cisternal perfusion) in anesthetized rabbits. Under control conditions, blood flow to the choroid plexus was 466 +/- 34 (mean +/- S.E.) ml min-1 100 g-1 and CSF production was 9.4 +/- 0.9 microliters min-1. Acetazolamide (25 mg kg-1 i.v.) decreased production of CSF by 55 +/- 5% despite a 2-fold increase in blood flow to the choroid plexus. The second goal of this study was to examine the role of hypercapnia, which occurs after administration of acetazolamide, in producing increases in blood flow. In animals in which hypercapnia was prevented by increases in ventilation, acetazolamide produced a similar increase in blood flow to the choroid plexus. We conclude that acetazolamide decreases the production of CSF but, in contrast to predictions based on studies in vitro, acetazolamide produces a marked increase in blood flow to the choroid plexus. Thus, changes in blood flow to the choroid plexus and production of CSF are uncoupled after administration of acetazolamide.\r"

For practical reasons the porcine coronary artery was selected to investigate the mechanisms responsible for these responses. Methylene blue, indomethacin, N-ethylmaleimide, pertussis toxin and cholera toxin all significantly attenuated the endothelium-dependent relaxation caused by fluoride. Pretreatment with deferoxamine had no effect on relaxation and superoxide dismutase/catalase potentiated the relaxation produced by fluoride. Fluoride also contracted vessels with or without the endothelium to equal tension levels and had no apparent relaxing effect on basal tone. The contraction produced by fluoride was significantly attenuated by pertussis toxin and cholera toxin; however, none of the other agents examined significantly altered contraction. Bradykinin also caused endothelium-dependent relaxation and this response was significantly attenuated by methylene blue but not indomethacin. Therefore, fluoride appears to relax the arteries by releasing an endothelium-derived relaxing factor similar to that released by bradykinin (methylene blue sensitive) and one or more prostanoid type endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) (indomethacin sensitive). Furthermore, fluoride relaxation and contraction may be guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein-mediated based on sensitivity to the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein modulators.\r"

The effectiveness of the electrical stimulation of the ascending 5-HT pathway on the firing activity of CA3 hippocampus pyramidal neurons was modulated by the intravenous administration of BZR ligands. The BZR agonists, diazepam, lorazepam and CL 218,872, dose-dependently enhanced the effectiveness of the stimulation. In contrast, the BZR inverse agonist, FG 7142, dose-dependently decreased it. The effects of agonist and inverse agonist BZR ligands were blocked by the specific BZR antagonist flumazenil. Diazepam and FG 7142 did not modify the efficacy of microiontophoretic applications of gamma-aminobutyric acid and 5-HT onto hippocampal CA3 neurons. BMY 7378, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist which blocks the effect of the endogenous 5-HT released by the electrical stimulation of 5-HT fibers in this paradigm, also blocked the enhancing action of diazepam on the effectiveness of the stimulation. These results indicate that the activation of BZR of type I modulates 5-HT neurotransmission, presumably through a presynaptic regulatory mechanism.\r"

In Purkinje fibers from young dogs, there is a biphasic effect on automaticity, which increases at low and decreases at high ACh concentrations. We used standard microelectrode techniques to study these actions of ACh. In fibers from young dogs, 10(-10) to 10(-9) M ACh increased automaticity and 10(-5) M ACh decreased automaticity. The decrease was blocked by the M2 muscarinic blocker AFDX-116, whereas the increase was blocked by the predominant M1 blocker pirenzepine. The M2 agonist oxotremorine never increased automaticity. Rather, it decreased automaticity and hyperpolarized adult and young fibers, the former more than the latter. The hyperpolarization and biphasic effect on automaticity of ACh in fibers from young dogs failed to occur after treatment with pertussis toxin, suggesting that these effects are dependent on a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. These electrophysiologic studies suggest that postsynaptic M1 and M2 muscarinic processes modulate the automatic response of Purkinje fibers from young dogs and that the postsynaptic M1 pathway is no longer seen in the adult.\r"

However, most of these studies have not found a place in clinical practice because of their nonspecificity, lack of sensitivity, time lag, added expense, and inconvenience. The commonly employed diagnostic tests (i.e., renal transplant ultrasound and 131I hippuran scintigram) are helpful in differentiating rejection from other causes of graft malfunction. The specific renal parenchymal disease, such as acute or chronic rejection or de novo or recurrent glomerular disease, contributing to graft malfunction can only be diagnosed by renal histopathologic study. Because hyperacute and accelerated acute rejections are irreversible and necessitate graft nephrectomy, measures should be taken to prevent this problem. High-dose corticosteroids still remain the mainstay of therapy for acute cellular rejection. In the case of steroid-resistant rejections, treatment with ALG or OKT3 appears promising. As there is no effective therapy for chronic allograft rejection, usual measures of delaying the progression of chronic renal failure should be employed, and patients should be advised to return to maintenance dialysis before they develop uremic symptoms. If current experiments demonstrating selective immunosuppression with monoclonal antibodies are found successful in human trials, one can expect further improvement in the outcome of renal transplantation.\r"

Final osmolarity, when measured directly with additives, ranged from 1200-1350 mOsm/L. Approximately 85% of the patients had acceptable tolerance to this new technique. The patient tolerance of the high osmolar admixture in peripheral veins might be attributed to the buffering and dilution effect of the IV fats in combination with the higher pH of the amino acid solutions and the addition of heparin to the admixture. Strong support for this technique was voiced by experienced nutritional support physicians and hospital personnel for use in surgical patients who have immediate short-term needs.\r"

  ".U": "90309910\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, are now used frequently to treat hypercholesterolemia. We studied the effects of specific inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by one of these agents (pravastatin) on the hepatic metabolism of cholesterol in patients with gallstone disease who were scheduled to undergo cholecystectomy. METHODS. Ten patients were treated with pravastatin (20 mg twice a day) for three weeks before cholecystectomy; 20 patients not treated served as controls. A liver specimen was obtained from each patient at operation, and the activities of rate-determining enzymes in cholesterol metabolism as well as low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor binding activity were determined. RESULTS. Pravastatin therapy reduced plasma total cholesterol by 26 percent and LDL cholesterol by 39 percent (P less than 0.005). Serum levels of free lathosterol, a precursor of cholesterol whose concentration reflects the rate of cholesterol synthesis in vivo, decreased by 63 percent (P less than 0.005), indicating reduced de novo biosynthesis of cholesterol. Microsomal HMG-CoA reductase activity, when analyzed in vitro in the absence of the inhibitor, was increased 11.8-fold (1344 +/- 311 vs. 105 +/- 14 pmol per minute per milligram of protein in the controls; P less than 0.001). The expression of LDL receptors was increased by 180 percent (P less than 0.005), whereas the activities of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (which governs bile acid synthesis) and of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol O-acyltransferase (which regulates cholesterol esterification) were unaffected by treatment. CONCLUSIONS. Inhibition of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase by pravastatin results in an increased expression of hepatic LDL receptors, which explains the lowered plasma levels of LDL cholesterol.\r"

The evolutionary relationship of the non-classical and classical MHC class I genes is unclear. Here we present the cloning and sequencing of the MHC class I genes of a New World primate, the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus). The expressed MHC class I genes of this species are more closely related to the human non-classical HLA-G gene than they are to genes of the human classical HLA-A, -B, and -C loci. These observations imply that classical and non-classical genes do not necessarily constitute mutually exclusive groups over evolutionary time.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation of T lymphocytes through their antigen receptor (T-cell receptor; TCR) results in the activation of a tyrosine kinase and the generation of phosphatidyl inositol (PtdIns)-derived second messengers. Several reports have indicated that CD45, a haematopoietic cell-specific surface glycoprotein with tyrosine phosphatase activity in its cytoplasmic domain, is important in lymphocyte activation. To examine the possibility that CD45 might influence proximal signal transduction events through the TCR, we have isolated a variant of the human T-cell leukaemic line, HPB-ALL, which fails to express this phosphatase. Unlike cells expressing CD45, stimulation of the TCR in the CD45-negative cell does not result in PtdIns-derived second messengers. Reconstitution of CD45 expression restored early signalling events through the TCR. To localize the site of CD45 action, the human muscarinic type 1 receptor, which also activates the PtdIns second messenger pathway, was transfected into the CD45-negative cell. Although stimulation of the TCR failed to generate PtdIns-derived second messengers, there was normal activity of the PtdIns pathway when human muscarinic receptor type 1 was stimulated, despite the absence of CD45. These data indicate that CD45 influences a cellular component that is essential for effective coupling of the TCR to the PtdIns second messenger pathway.\r"

Kr encodes a polypeptide containing DNA-binding zinc-finger motifs, disruptions of which yield Kr mutants. We have assayed the transcriptional activities of wild-type Kr protein as well as Lac repressor/Kr fusion proteins in HeLa and CV-1 cells. Wild-type Kr and a Lac-Kr chimaeric protein repressed transcription from reporter promoters in which a consensus Kr binding site derived from sequences within the even-skipped promoter had been inserted in an upstream position. We mapped the repression function of Kr to an alanine-rich amino-terminal region of the protein, as a Lac/Kr fusion protein containing only amino acids 26-110 of Kr repressed transcription from a reporter promoter containing upstream lac operators. This demonstrates that the DNA-binding and repression activities of the Kr protein are distinct. These data are consistent with genetic evidence that Kr represses even-skipped and hunchback expression, and suggest that Kr is a negative regulator of transcription in Drosophila.\r"

Interaction of p60v-src with the plasma membrane is essential for transforming activity, and is mediated by association with a membrane-bound Src receptor protein. Evidence for the existence of an Src receptor is based on the ability of a myristylated peptide containing the N-terminal Src sequence to inhibit binding of p60v-src to plasma membranes in vitro: binding of p60v-src to a plasma membrane receptor is therefore mediated by N-terminal Src sequences. Here we report that a myristyl-Src peptide, but not the corresponding non-myristylated peptide, can be specifically crosslinked to a plasma membrane protein of relative molecular mass 32,000 (Mr32K). The 32K protein represents an Src-binding protein in the plasma membrane that is likely to be a component of the myristyl-Src receptor, and which could be involved in cellular transformation.\r"

  ".W": "The CD8 glycoprotein of T cells bind nonpolymorphic regions of class I major histocompatibility complex proteins on target cells and these interactions promote antigen recognition and signalling by the T-cell receptor. Studies using artificial membranes indicated that effective CD8/class I interaction is critical for response by alloantigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes when class I protein is the only ligand on the antigen-bearing surface. But significant CD8-mediated binding of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to non-antigenic class I protein could not be detected in the absence of the alloantigen. These apparently contradictory findings indicate that CD8 binding to class I protein might be activated through the T-cell receptor and the results reported here demonstrate that this is the case. Treatment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with soluble anti-T-cell receptor antibody activates adhesion of the cytotoxic T lymphocytes to class I, but not class II proteins. The specificity of this binding implies that it is mediated by CD8 and blocking by anti-CD8 antibodies confirmed this. Furthermore, binding of CD8 to class I protein resulted in generation of an additional signal(s) necessary to initiate response at low T-cell receptor occupancy levels.\r"

The t(14; 18) translocation results in deregulated expression of the bcl-2 gene and synthesis of inappropriately high levels of the Bcl-2 protein. Gene transfer studies suggest a role for Bcl-2 in cell survival, growth enhancement and oncogenic transformation. To test the suggestion that GTP-binding by Bcl-2 may mediate its biological effects we characterized the GTP-binding proteins in lymphoid cells expressing Bcl-2. Expression of several small GTP-binding proteins was found to be ubiquitous and did not vary with levels of Bcl-2. By using immunological, electrophoretic and cell-fractionation techniques, we separated Bcl-2 from G proteins of small relative molecular mass (Mr) and showed that it is incapable of binding GTP. Our results show that small Mr G proteins are widely expressed in lymphoid cells and that Bcl-2 is not a novel member of this GTP-binding protein family.\r"

Their synergistic activities are required for efficient activation of transcription from different promoters by many different oncogenes, serum growth factors and the tumour promoter TPA. We show here that the products of the ets-1 and -2 proto-oncogenes, whose biological function was previously unknown, are transcription factors that activate transcription through the PEA 3 motif. The p68c-ets-1 protein specifically binds to DNA and contains a transcriptional activation domain. The ets-like gene family therefore seems to encode a new family of transcription factors, apparently unrelated to other transcription factors. The p68c-ets-1 protein cooperates with c-Fos and c-Jun (components of AP-1) for activation of transcription from the oncogene-responsive domain of the polyoma enhancer, indicating that combined activity of all three oncoproteins could be involved in the response of cells to growth stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "Wilms' tumour is an embryonic kidney tumour thought to arise through aberrant mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and to result from loss of function of a 'tumour suppressor' gene(s). Both sporadic and syndrome-associated Wilms' tumours are accompanied by an increased frequency of abnormalities of the urinary tract and genitalia. Deletional analysis of individuals with the WAGR syndrome (for, Wilms' tumour, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities and mental retardation) showed that a Wilms' tumour gene lies at chromosomal position 11p13. This led to the isolation of a candidate Wilms' tumour gene, encoding a zinc-finger protein which is likely to be a transcription factor. To gain insight into the role of this candidate gene in normal development and tumorigenesis, we have now performed in situ messenger RNA hybridization on sections of human embryos and Wilms' tumours. The candidate Wilms' tumour gene is expressed specifically in the condensed mesenchyme, renal vesicle and glomerular epithelium of the developing kidney, in the related mesonephric glomeruli and in cells approximating these structures in tumours. The other main sites of expression are the genital ridge, fetal gonad and mesothelium. These data suggest that (1) this candidate is indeed a Wilms' tumour gene, (2) the associated genital abnormalities are pleiotropic effects of mutation in the Wilms' tumour gene itself, in support of recent genetic analysis, and (3) this gene has a specific role in kidney development and a wider role in mesenchymal-epithelial transitions.\r"

Unfortunately, the severity of radiographic findings may not directly correlate with the occurrence of cervical myelopathy. MRI has emerged as a noninvasive method of assessing the condition of the spinal cord and thecal sac as well as more precisely defining the nature of inflammatory soft-tissue changes that may result in bony erosion and cord compression. Ankylosing spondylitis is an arthropathy that classically involves the axial skeleton. Complications include acute fracture and pseudarthroses of the spine. Rarely, the development of a cauda equina syndrome has been reported. In addition to classic erosive arthropathies affecting the axial skeleton, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament may be associated with the development of severe myelopathy. A recently described type of amyloidosis characterized by beta-2 microglobulin deposition has been reported in patients on long-term hemodialysis. Bony erosion is seen in the spine in these patients. A causal relationship between beta-2 microglobulin and hemodialysis spondylarthropathy has yet to be definitely established.\r"

  ".W": "Even though the incidence of multinodular goiter is decreasing in the United States, still we see a large number of neglected goiters causing pressure effects on the surrounding structures. Both tracheal and esophageal displacement cause compression symptoms. However, tracheal compression may lead to acute airway distress. Eighteen per cent of our patients presented with acute airway problems, requiring emergency admission or intubation. Surgical intervention has been our preferred approach whenever there are signs or symptoms of tracheoesophageal compression. Fifty-five per cent of patients had only tracheal compression, while 18 per cent had only esophageal compression. Twenty-seven per cent had compression of both trachea and esophagus. Eighty-five per cent of patients had some symptoms of compression, while only 15% were asymptomatic despite large goiters. Compression symptoms and acute problems were noticed more frequently in patients with substernal goiters. Our preoperative work-up regularly included complete history, physical examination, indirect laryngoscopy, and airway radiography. Barium studies were performed if patients had dysphagia. Computed tomography scans were utilized if there was mediastinal extension. Pulmonary flow volume studies were used to locate the site of compression. However, decisions relative to surgical intervention were based primarily on clinical judgment. Since the postoperative morbidity is minimal in surgery for thyroid abnormalities, we strongly recommend early surgical intervention in patients with tracheoesophageal compression caused by enlarged thyroids.\r"

It is important to infuse an adequate amount of calories and protein but to avoid the stress of overfeeding. Various laboratory values may be monitored to ensure that each of the nutrients administered is being adequately tolerated by the patient. Keeping these principles in mind, primary care physicians can deliver a TPN regimen specifically suited for individual patients and can anticipate and prevent any potential complications.\r"

The solo LTRs, unlinked to retrovirus structural genes, are located approximately 5 kilobases apart from each other and in the same transcriptional orientation, which is opposite to that for the HLA-DQB1 gene. These elements exhibit greater than 90% homology to the LTRs of the human endogenous retrovirus HERV-K10. The conservation of putative regulatory elements found within the LTRs and their position relative to the HLA-DQB1 gene suggest that these elements may confer distinct regulatory properties on genes in the HLA-DQ region. Polymorphic variation between different HLA haplotypes for the presence of the LTRs at this location and of the molecular architecture within this subregion is supported by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis. Comparisons of chromosomes with and without the LTRs in this region will provide a unique opportunity in the human genome to analyze transposition or integration of retroviral sequences.\r"

Both analyses support the conclusion that VH and V kappa gene families pair without bias; as would be expected for random association, the frequencies of specific VH + V kappa pairs may be estimated by the product of the independent VH and V kappa frequencies. Based upon the frequencies at which 9 VH and 12 V kappa gene families are expressed, we calculated the expected usage for approximately 100 VH + V kappa family pairings in neonatal and adult C57BL/6 mice. Variability in the expression of such VH + V kappa pairings is considerable; pairs representing greater than 10% to less than 0.01% of the splenic B-cell population occur. This variability is most pronounced in the neonate, where 6 VH + V kappa family pairs account for nearly 40% of all mitogen-reactive B cells. As the neonate matures, the distribution of frequencies for VH + V kappa pairings becomes more nearly uniform. This process may underlie the patterned acquisition of humoral immune responsiveness.\r"

Aldose reductase inhibitors have been observed to prevent or delay the onset of these complications; however, more potent and specific inhibitors are needed. Development of new inhibitors necessitates a better understanding of the molecular structure of this protein. To elucidate the structure-function relationships of aldose reductase and to develop methods of regulating this enzyme, large and homogeneous quantities of rat lens aldose reductase have been expressed in bacterial cells. A construction of the complete coding sequence and 3' untranslated region for rat lens aldose reductase was assembled in the expression vector pKK233-2 (Pharmacia). This construction expresses an active enzyme that has been purified and demonstrates kinetic, immunological, and inhibitory properties similar to rat lens aldose reductase.\r"

The current-voltage relation for cAMP-activated Cl- current was linear from -100 to +100 mV and showed no time-dependent changes in current during voltage pulses. Ca2+ ionophores or increased pipette Ca2+ increased both Cl- and K+ currents 2-30 times. The Ca2(+)-activated Cl- current was outwardly rectified, activated during depolarizing voltage pulses, and inactivated during hyperpolarizing voltage pulses. Addition of ionophore after forskolin further increased Cl- conductance 1.5-5 times, and the current took on the time-dependent characteristics of that stimulated by Ca2+. Thus, cAMP and Ca2+ activate Cl- conductances with different properties, implying that these second messengers activate different Cl- channels or that they induce different conductive and kinetic states in the same Cl- channel.\r"

It was found that in the presence of a wheat germ extract factor there was a high-affinity phase of the uptake into mouse liver mitochondria at 10-300 pM apocytochrome c, and a lower-affinity phase through 4000 pM. Without the factor, the high-affinity phase was absent. The stimulatory effect of the factor could not be elicited with various reductants, such as NADH, FMN, and ferrous protoheme IX. Conversely, when mitochondria loaded with apocytochrome c were resuspended in fresh medium, the protein readily reequilibrated. Successive washings depleted greater than 95% of the associated apoprotein but removed no holoprotein. Proteases (proteinase K or trypsin) added to a suspension of mitochondria loaded with apoprotein digested an amount of apoprotein similar to that which would have been dissociated during the same time, as measured by successive washings in the absence of protease. Mitochondria loaded with apoprotein and similarly treated with protease continued exporting the apoprotein, even after the protease was inhibited and removed, suggesting that most of the apoprotein associated with the organelle was in a protease-resistant compartment. Apocytochrome c mutants in which serines or alanines replaced cysteines 14 and 17, which bind the prosthetic group, behaved like the cysteine-containing protein, indicating that the covalent attachment of the heme is unrelated to the translocation of the apoprotein.\r"

The molecular mass was approximately 90 kDa, as estimated by gel-filtration analysis. Yeast PKC was activated by the simultaneous addition of Ca2+, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine. Free arachidonic acid alone could activate the enzyme to some extent. However, yeast PKC did not respond significantly to tumor-promoting phorbol esters. GTP did not serve as phosphate donor. The yeast enzyme showed substrate specificity distinctly different from that of mammalian PKCs. H1 histone and protamine were poor substrates. With myelin basic protein as a model substrate, yeast PKC phosphorylated threonyl residues preferentially, whereas rat brain PKCs phosphorylated seryl residues preferentially. Further studies should elucidate the role of yeast PKC in cellular regulation and cell cycle control.\r"

The immunocytochemical localization of the c-fos-encoded antigen, Fos, was coupled with the immunocytochemical localization of LHRH. LHRH neurons showed no Fos immunoreactivity during diestrus-1, diestrus-2, estrus, or the morning of proestrus. However, Fos was expressed in LHRH neurons from 1600 to 2200 hours during proestrus. The timing of onset of Fos expression in LHRH neurons during proestrus suggests a strong correlation with increased LH secretion. Pentobarbital, which blocks the preovulatory LH surge, blocked Fos expression in LHRH neurons, but the LHRH neurons expressed Fos on the following afternoon at the time of the expected delayed LH surge. Not all LHRH neurons expressed Fos during the LHRH surge. Approximately half of the LHRH neurons were activated in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus; more anteriorly positioned LHRH neurons did not express Fos, resulting in an overall stimulation of 40% of the LHRH neurons. These data provide direct evidence that stimulation of LHRH neurons during proestrus takes place at the LHRH cell bodies, and identify the specific population of LHRH neurons which are activated.\r"

HLA heavy-chain mRNA is equally stable in cytokine-treated and -untreated endothelial cells. Interferon gamma does not increase tumor necrosis factor receptor number or affinity on human endothelial cells. We conclude that the synergistic increase in class I major histocompatibility complex cell-surface expression results principally from the synergistic increase in transcriptional rates. We propose that this increase is caused by the cooperative binding of independently activated transcription factors to the promoter/enhancer sequences of class I genes.\r"

The regions of the kinesin molecule responsible for generating movement were determined by studying the heavy chain of Drosophila kinesin, and its truncated forms, expressed in Escherichia coli. The results demonstrate that (i) kinesin heavy chain alone, without the light chains and other eukaryotic factors, is able to induce microtubule movement in vitro, and (ii) a fragment likely to contain only the kinesin head is also capable of inducing microtubule motility. Thus, the amino-terminal 450 amino acids of kinesin contain all the basic elements needed to convert chemical energy into mechanical force.\r"

  ".W": "Using strips of human basilar arteries mounted in organ chambers to record isometric tension, we investigated vascular reactivity to thrombin and bradykinin. Both agents produced endothelium-dependent relaxation of basilar artery strips precontracted with phenylephrine but had no effect on resting tension in strips with or without endothelium. The relaxations caused by thrombin were abolished by antithrombin III/heparin, hirudin, and MD805. Thrombin but not bradykinin caused complete tachyphylaxis toward a second exposure. Indomethacin did not inhibit the relaxations induced by thrombin or bradykinin, whereas bromophenacyl bromide and methylene blue did. Aging decreased the relaxation induced by thrombin but did not affect the concentration needed to reach 50% maximal relaxation, nor did it affect the maximal relaxation in response to bradykinin, calcium ionophore A23187, and sodium nitroprusside. Our results suggest that thrombin and bradykinin produce endothelium-dependent relaxations mediated by an endothelium-derived relaxing substance and that the relaxation caused by thrombin is mediated by a proteolytic action on endothelial cells. The decrease in relaxations in response to thrombin with increasing age might be due to a decrease in the number or sensitivity of thrombin receptors on endothelial cells.\r"

This study investigated whether potassium loading protects against gentamicin nephrotoxicity in the rat. In part I, group GK ate a diet containing 3.5% potassium and drank 0.2 mol/L KCl. Pair-fed rats eating a standard diet, group G, ate a 1% potassium diet and drank water. After 10 days, each group received gentamicin subcutaneously, 60 mg/kg twice daily for 8 days. The control groups, K and C, received the high or normal potassium diet, respectively. To control for a protective effect from a high solute load, the effect of equimolar NaCl loading was studied in group GNa and Na. At the end of the 8 days of gentamicin, inulin clearance was significantly higher in GK compared with G(0.6 +/- 0.1 v 0.3 +/- 0.1 mL/min per 100 g body weight [BW], P less than 0.05), but group GNa (0.4 +/- 0.1 mL/min per 100 g BW) was not different from group G. Morphological studies demonstrated that potassium-loaded rats (group GK) had significantly less proximal tubular necrosis compared with rats on a standard potassium diet, group G. Sodium loading did not protect against cellular necrosis. Part II studied renal function, cortical Na,K-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and gentamicin accumulation after 2 days of gentamicin to determine the early functional and biochemical effects of potassium loading before overt renal functional impairment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We followed 20 episodes of MRSA-associated conjunctivitis in 19 patients occurring over a three-year period in a 432-bed long-term-care facility. RESULTS: The clinical picture was that of a purulent conjunctivitis from which MRSA was isolated on culture. Seventeen patients had severe, pre-existing neurologic impairment. Nine were colonized by MRSA before the onset of conjunctivitis. Seven of eight patients treated with oral ciprofloxacin and all eight patients treated with topical vancomycin showed clinical resolution of conjunctivitis. Persistence of MRSA colonization at a variety of anatomic sites was noted after therapy following 14 episodes. CONCLUSION: MRSA-associated conjunctivitis in our long-term-care facility was notable for its occurrence in patients with severe neurologic disease. Both oral ciprofloxacin and topical vancomycin therapy were associated with clinical resolution. Since MRSA is endemic in many long-term-care facilities, it is likely that MRSA-associated conjunctivitis will be increasingly recognized.\r"

Review of recent series indicates that postsplenectomy sepsis is more likely after splenectomy in childhood than after splenectomy in adulthood but may occur after splenectomy at any age. In some cases, sepsis has been documented many years after surgery. The pneumococcus remains the predominant organism, and the characteristic course is rapid progression to multisystem involvement with high morbidity and mortality. Predisposition to pneumococcal sepsis and to other infections reflects the role of the spleen in mechanical filtration of particulate material in the bloodstream, generation of opsonins and other soluble mediators of phagocytosis, and anatomic juxtaposition of different elements of the immune system. Whereas pneumococcal vaccine is indicated in asplenic patients, the value of other interventions requires further evaluation.\r"

The change in binding showed a biphasic dose dependence on histamine and was not associated with changes in DHA (beta-2 receptor) or yohimbine (alpha-2 receptor) binding. The induction of alpha adrenergic receptors by the ubiquitous inflammatory mediator histamine may help explain the alpha adrenergic hyperresponsiveness seen in asthmatic patients.\r"

Eosinophils obtained from guinea pig peritoneal fluid were purified and activated with Ca2+ ionophore A23187 using a two-stage reaction. Supernatant obtained from different eosinophil cell numbers (3 x 10(5) to 10(7) cells) did not alter resting tension but potentiated the contractile response to histamine in a cell number-dependent fashion. Thus, at a cell number of 10(7), the supernatant decreased the mean (+/- SE) log histamine concentration producing 50% of maximum contraction significantly from a control value of -5.62 +/- 0.10 to -5.99 +/- 0.07 M (p less than 0.05). The potentiating effect of the supernatant (10(7) cells) was not altered by either removal of tracheal epithelium or by pretreatment with indomethacin when cells were activated. However, pretreatment with AA 861 completely inhibited the supernatant (10(7) cells)-induced potentiating effect associated with inhibition of leukotriene C4, D4, and E4 release in the supernatant. The concentrations of exogenous authentic leukotrienes chosen to match concentrations in the supernatant mimicked the supernatant-induced potentiating response to histamine. These results suggest that leukotrienes released from eosinophils cause hyperresponsiveness of airway smooth muscle in vitro.\r"

The response to allergen challenge was monitored by counting sneezes and by quantifying the levels of histamine, kinins, TAME-esterase activity, and albumin in recovered nasal lavages. Following histamine challenges, sneezing and the levels of albumin were recorded. Terfenadine significantly reduced sneezing and the levels of histamine, kinins, TAME-esterase activity, and albumin seen after antigen challenge. In addition, terfenadine reduced the increase in sneezing and vascular permeability, as measured by albumin levels, following challenge with histamine. No significant differences were found between the two doses of terfenadine. Our data suggest that terfenadine not only antagonizes the H1 activity of released histamine during the immediate allergic reaction but also, at currently prescribed doses, inhibits the release of histamine.\r"

In this study, we investigated and compared the mechanisms of this NK activity in tuberculous pleural effusions and peripheral blood. Cytotoxicity was augmented in tuberculous pleural effusion mononuclear cells (PEMNC) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) by culture with purified protein derivative (PPD). Prior to culture with PPD, there were many more interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R, p55) on Leu 11+ (CD16+) cells in tuberculous PEMNC than in tuberculous PBMNC. After 5 days of culture with PPD, the numbers of IL-2R increased in both PEMNC and PBMNC. PPD-induced cytotoxicity was inhibited by the addition of anti-IL-2R monoclonal antibody (anti-IL-2R mAb). Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production was abundant in the supernatants of cultured tuberculous PEMNC and PBMNC, but very little interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IFN-alpha and -beta were produced. Considerably more IFN-gamma was produced in tuberculous PEMNC than in tuberculous PBMNC, and PPD-induced cytotoxicity was inhibited by anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody (anti-IFN-gamma mAb). Cell surface analysis after PPD-induced cytotoxicity was performed by complement-mediated cytolysis. Leu 11+ cells exhibited essential cytotoxicity in the induction and effector phases, but neither OKT4+ (CD4+) nor OKT8+ (CD8+) cells displayed such cytotoxicity. These data suggest that Leu 11+ cells in tuberculous PEMNC are activated by M. tuberculosis through IFN-gamma and that IL-2R plays an important role in the activation of NK cells.\r"

Seven atopic, mildly asthmatic subjects were studied. Baseline measurements were reported previously and included forced expiratory volumes, flow rates, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and methacholine reactivity. Approximately 1 yr later, spirometry and BAL were repeated, but BAL was performed immediately after ISH challenge. As indices of inflammation, BAL measurements were made of eosinophils, neutrophils, epithelial cells, leukotrienes B4, C4, D4, and E4, prostaglandins D2, E2, and F2 alpha, thromboxane B2, histamine, and total protein. Compared with baseline, ISH was associated with higher BAL concentrations of the following: leukotriene B4 (10 versus 121 pg/ml, p = 0.02), leukotrienes C4/D4/E4 (46 versus 251 pg/ml, p = 0.02), eosinophils (0.8 versus 2.2%, p = 0.04), and epithelial cells (2.1 versus 6.1%, p = 0.05). Trends toward significant increases were seen in BAL concentrations of neutrophils and prostaglandin D2. No statistically significant increases were found in BAL measurements of total protein, histamine, prostaglandins E2 or F2 alpha, thromboxane B2, lymphocytes, or macrophages. The magnitude of the response to ISH, as measured by change in FEV1, did not correlate with BAL levels of cells or mediators. This study indicates that ISH, even in mildly asthmatic subjects, is associated with airway increases in a spectrum of bronchoactive mediators and inflammatory cells, supporting the observations of others that antagonists of a single mediator are unlikely to have major clinical effectiveness in ISH or exercise-induced asthma.\r"

Recent evidence shows collagenase to be instrumental in the progression of infectious and noninfectious corneal ulceration. We investigated the effect of systemic tetracycline on the incidence of corneal perforation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa ulcerative keratitis in rabbits. Twenty rabbits were assigned randomly to two groups in a masked fashion. All corneas were inoculated with 10(6) P. aeruginosa organisms. Ten rabbits (20 eyes) received intramuscular tetracycline 50mg/kg/day in a saline vehicle (treatment group), and ten rabbits (20 eyes) received saline alone (control group) for ten days. The incidence of corneal perforation in the treatment group (45%) was significantly lower than that in the control group (80%, P less than .02). This appeared to be independent of any antimicrobial effect from tetracycline. Administration of tetracycline may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of P. aeruginosa corneal ulcers.\r"

There was considerable overlap in the physiologic scores and the predicted mortality rates between those patients who were admitted to the MICU and those who were not. There was no discrete score or mortality rate at which triage to the MICU would have included most MICU patients but excluded most patients who survived without admission to the MICU. While uniform MICU admission criteria would be desirable, current scoring systems may not have the desired sensitivity or specificity to establish such criteria. Using a receiver operating characteristic curve, we demonstrated that diagnosis-adjusted mortality rates could predict as well as Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation scores which patients would receive MICU admission and intervention. This suggests that, for different diagnoses, specific clinical variables and laboratory tests may have different predictive importance for MICU admission. Prospective models of clinical variables using receiver operating characteristic curves in various medical diseases may improve triage procedures.\r"

To determine the frequency and magnitude of hypotensive responses to common daily activities, and their potential relationship to falls in the elderly, we examined blood pressure (BP) and heart rate during a standardized series of activities in 38 institutionalized recurrent fallers (age, 87 +/- 6 years), 20 institutionalized nonfallers (age, 85 +/- 5 years), and 10 healthy young control subjects (age, 24 +/- 3 years). The coefficient of variation for systolic BP during all activities was higher in elderly subjects (fallers, 14% +/- 5%; nonfallers, 12% +/- 3%) than in young control subjects (8% +/- 1%). In contrast, the coefficient of variation for heart rate during all activities was higher in young subjects than in the elderly subjects. Elderly subjects had marked BP reduction following meals and nitroglycerin, which was significantly greater in fallers than in nonfallers, independent of the cause of the fall. Thus, institutionalized elderly have marked BP variability and hypotensive responses to meals and nitroglycerin. A decline in BP during common preload-reducing stresses may predispose some elderly people to falls.\r"

The EGF and insulin promoted a 202% increase over controls in collagen synthesis by day 15, while diabetic rats that received EGF or insulin alone had significantly less collagen than controls. All groups that received insulin had lower collagenase activity than both controls and diabetic rats that received EGF.

The remaining 18 eyes were inoculated with 0.1 mL of the P aeruginosa suspension; the lenses were not replaced. All eyes were again closed by tarsorrhaphy for 4, 8, 16, 24, 36 , or 48 hours. Ulcerative keratitis occurred in contact lens-wearing eyes only, as P aeruginosa penetrated the epithelium at 8 to 36 hours, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration began at 24 hours. Compared with conventional abrasion-wound models, the time course of infectious keratitis in this model was delayed, possibly due to less preexisting corneal trauma, but our findings suggest that soft contact lens wear facilitates bacterial invasion and also inhibits the host inflammatory response.\r"

By artificially flattening the cortex before processing, it was possible to reconstruct the pattern formed by the ocular dominance columns throughout most of the primary visual cortex. The columns form a mosaic of irregular parallel stripes about 500 microns to 1000 microns wide (right eye column plus left eye column measures 1 to 2 mm), oriented at right angles to the boundary of the primary visual cortex. The columns are wider near the boundary of the primary visual cortex and within the representation of the peripheral visual field, the ocular dominance columns of the ipsilateral eye become fragmented until they disappear altogether at the border of the monocular crescent representation. The arrangement of ocular dominance columns in the human visual cortex is very similar to the pattern reported in the macaque monkey, although the columns in humans are wider.\r"

Serum levels of IdGN2 were significantly higher in the patients with lupus nephritis than in those without, and they were higher in all lupus patients compared with the healthy control subjects. However, the same observations were true for serum levels of IdX. There were significant positive correlations between the serum levels of IgG, IdGN2, IdX, and anti-DNA. HLA typing at the DR and DQ loci was performed in 105 lupus patients of different races (Caucasian, black, and Asian/Polynesian/Filipino). Serum levels of IdGN2 in 83 of these individuals did not correlate with any of the HLA class II haplotypes currently known to predispose to lupus nephritis. We conclude that the high serum levels of IdGN2, which are characteristic of some patients with lupus nephritis, may often result from polyclonal B cell activation rather than from idiotype-specific upregulation associated with one or more of the class II genes that predispose to nephritis in this disease.\r"

At the same time, it may also be hazardous by 1) increasing blood pressure in some patients (perhaps 15%); 2) disturbing sleep; 3) reducing intake of other valuable nutrients; and 4) decreasing host resistance to such stressful events as diarrhea, hyperthermia, and bleeding. In view of the limited positive effect demonstrated in short term studies, the absence of proven reduction in cardiovascular disease occurrence, as well as both documented and theoretical hazards, a blanket recommendation that all hypertensives restrict sodium intake is unwarranted. Moderate sodium restriction is, like other strategies, one therapeutic modality that may be applied, with caution, in individual cases.\r"

A dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell growth and viability was observed. Cultures exposed to 2.3 micrograms Ni2+/ml showed approximately 50% cell survival at 5 days. An increase in release of interleukin 1 by keratinocytes was detected following culture for 24 h with a Ni2+ concentration of 2.3-11.5 micrograms/ml. Short periods of incubation (30 min) with these concentrations induced an activation of lipoxygenase in leucocytes from healthy subjects, without modifying cell viability. The results suggest that the percutaneous penetration of small amounts of Ni2+ can result in damage to keratinocytes and can initiate sensitization.\r"

At birth, exposed children had increased rates of hyperpigmentation, eyelid swelling and discharge, deformed nails, acne, natal teeth and swollen gums compared to controls. On examination, they had a much higher rate of dystrophic finger-nails and pigmented or dystrophic toe-nails than controls. They also had an increased rate of hyperpigmentation and acne.

To determine the joining (J) and variable (V) region usage of the two receptor types, T gamma and T delta gene rearrangements and expression were analyzed in each gamma/delta T-cell clone. The results showed that the J and V regions used by the two receptor types are distinct: clones that express the type 1 receptor carry potentially functional rearrangements in J gamma P-V gamma 9 for gamma and in J delta 1-V delta 2 for delta; and clones that express the type 2 receptor had potentially functional rearrangements in J gamma 2-V gamma 2/V gamma 4 for gamma and in J delta 1-V delta 1 for delta.

The model was developed to study TF induced on venous endothelium in situ. However, unlike previous studies with TF expressed on cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells, factors IX and X were activated without first having to expose the vein wall to a perturbing stimulus. Histologic studies revealed that washing the vein and mixing the reaction mixture before subsampling had disrupted the endothelium. Immunostaining with anti-TF antibodies revealed no staining of endothelium but intense staining in extensions of Wharton's jelly penetrating fenestrations of the muscularis media of the vein. Thus, the model provided data on factor VIIa/TF formed, not on endothelium, but within the mucoid connective tissue of Wharton's jelly. It is known that factor VIIa/TF formed with TF in suspension or with TF expressed on the surface of cultured cells activates factor X more rapidly than factor IX. In contrast, in the umbilical vein model, when each substrate was present in an 88 nmol/L concentration, factors IX and X were activated at equivalent rates (mean activation rate for factor IX, 18.8 +/- 3.6 nmol/L/h; for factor X, 17.8 +/- 2.9 nmol/L/h; n = 9 paired vein segments). These data strengthen the evidence that factor VIIa/TF activation of factor IX represents a key initial reaction of coagulation in tissues. These results also show that data obtained with factor VIIa/TF complexes formed on the surface of cultured cells need not hold for factor VIIa/TF complexes formed in extracellular matrix.\r"

Plasma cells from 78% (43/55) of patients with MM strongly expressed the natural killer cell antigen CD56 (NKH-1, Leu-19). Of the 23 patients with MGUS, none showed strong CD56 reactivity, although three had weak reactivity in less than 20% of plasma cells. Myeloma cells expressing CD56 did not coexpress the CD57 or CD16 antigens. Patients with CD56-positive plasma cells had both indolent and aggressive disease. However, the 12 CD56-negative patients had predominantly aggressive disease with an unexpected preponderance of kappa Bence Jones only myeloma (5/10[50%] evaluable patients). Polyclonal plasma cells from non-neoplastic tissue sites (normal bone marrows, lymph nodes, tonsillar biopsies, and gut-mucosa biopsies) showed a near absence of CD56. We conclude that isolated, strong CD56 expression is common in MM, but not in MGUS or reactive plasma cells. The potential biologic importance of CD56 positivity in myeloma is reviewed.\r"

In contrast, splenic B cells, the A20 B-cell lymphoma, and four Ly1- B cell lines derived from long-term bone marrow cultures failed to adhere substiantially to bone marrow cultures failed to adhere substiantially to bone marrow stroma. Ly1+ pre-B cell lines were induced to express kappa light chains by exposure to either lipopolysaccharide (LPS), recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1), or stromal cells. However, induction of kappa light chains failed to prevent pre-B cell adherence to stromal cells. Supernatants derived from primary bone marrow stromal cells decreased Ly1 expression on the Ly1+ pre-B cell lines. These experiments suggest that (1) expression of immunoglobulin light chains by developing Ly1+ pre-B cells is mediated by bone marrow stromal cells; (2) loss of specific adherence to stroma is progressive and occurs post-light chain induction; and (3) soluble products of stromal cells may downregulate expression of surface Ly1 on otherwise Ly1+ pre-B cells. The importance of these observations to the development of both the Ly1- and Ly1+ B cell lineages in the mouse is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90315438\r", 
  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is a cytokine that displays a pleomorphic array of effects on different cell populations. Evidence is presented that TNF may be constitutively produced by B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL) cells and that it may play a relevant role in these diseases. These conclusions are based on the presence of circulating levels of TNF in the serum of 20 of the 24 patients tested (83.3%), while undetectable values were found in normal sera. The suggestion that the increased serum levels were due to the leukemic cell population is strengthened by the evidence that purified B-CLL and HCL cells may constitutively release variable degrees of TNF. These levels markedly increase after incubation with interferon gamma or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) plus phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The cellular release of TNF by primary B-CLL cells was significantly (P less than .001) higher in B-CLL stage O-I patients compared with stage II-III patients. The demonstration that, in B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, the pathologic cells may release TNF was further confirmed by the presence of the mRNA for this cytokine in primary and/or in pre-activated cells. Recombinant TNF was capable of inducing a proliferative signal only in a minority of cases (4/24); in most cases it was ineffective, and, in a few, it reduced the degree of proliferation. Furthermore, in costimulatory experiments with interleukin-2 and PHA plus PMA, TNF was ineffective. On the other hand, when primary B-CLL cells were incubated in the presence of an anti-TNF antibody, in 8 of 12 independent experiments a 2- to 15-fold increase in thymidine uptake was documented. Taken together, these results suggest that TNF may play a regulatory role in the progression of the neoplastic clone in B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders and may be implicated in some of the side effects associated with these diseases.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of selectively depleting CD8+ cells from donor bone marrow were assessed in 36 patients receiving transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling as treatment for leukemia. Donor bone marrow underwent ex vivo treatment using anti-Leu-2 monoclonal antibody and complement. Patients received cyclosporine post-transplant for 6 months. Thirty-three patients had initial engraftment. Three failed to have hematologic recovery, and one patient with initial engraftment had late graft failure. The actuarial incidence of grade greater than or equal to 2 acute graft-versus-host disease was 28% +/- 18% and was usually confined to the skin. Of 33 patients with engraftment, 32 were complete chimeras and one had mixed chimerism. The tempo of hematologic and immunologic recovery was comparable with that reported with transplantation of unmodified bone marrow, although CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recovered at comparable rates. The actuarial rate of leukemia relapse was 11% +/- 10%, occurring in three patients with acute leukemia but in none of 13 patients transplanted for chronic myelogenous leukemia. Actuarial survival was 57% +/- 17% at 2 years. These data indicate that after transplantation of marrow depleted of CD8+ cells, engraftment with prompt hematologic and immunologic recovery generally occurs, with a relatively low rate of acute graft-versus-host disease. Graft failure remains a problem despite retention of CD4+ cells within the donor marrow. The lack of leukemia relapse in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia suggests retention of a graft-versus-leukemia effect, at least for this malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "From 1986 to 1988, 35 patients with a hepatoma judged either inoperable or unresectable because of coexistent cirrhosis were treated with hepatic arterial embolization of mitomycin C microcapsules. Five of these 35 patients (14.5%) could not be treated because of inability to selectively cannulate the hepatic artery and were therefore excluded from the evaluation (feasibility rate, 86%). There were 24 men and six women with a median age of 57 years (range, 47 to 79) who could be classified as Okuda I (14 pts) or Okuda II (16 pts) and Child Class A:18 and Child Class B:12 in the remaining patients. A median dose of 0.5 mg mitomycin C/kg was administered to each subject and the treatment was repeated at 5 to 6 week intervals. Seventy courses were administered to these 30 patients (median, two courses/patient; range, 1 to 4). Minor complications were frequent (63%) but always either resolved spontaneously or after appropriate medical treatment. Neither severe renal nor hepatic toxicity was observed. No specific treatment related mortality was observed. When alpha-fetoprotein levels and tumor volume were assessed to evaluate the response to treatment using established criteria for identifying a response, an objective response was found in 43% of the cases treated. The actuarial median survival was 7 months and the 1-year actuarial survival was 36% (51% for those rated as Child Class A and 0% for those identified as Child Class B, P = 0.04 and 78% rated as Okuda Types I and 0% Okuda type II, P = 0.0001). The excellent quality of life and the increased survival rate experienced after mitomycin C microcapsule embolization suggest that this treatment modality can be used successfully in patients seen in the West who have unresectable hepatoma.\r"

  ".W": "From 1977 to 1988, 215 patients with a diagnosis of testicular seminoma were referred to the University Hospital, Hamburg, West Germany, for radiation therapy (RT). In 15 patients a careful review of the histologic condition showed signs of embryonal cell carcinoma. Three patients refused completion of therapy. No patient was lost to follow-up. On this basis, a retrospective review of 197 patients was carried out. One hundred thirty-three patients were classified as Stage I (67%), 39 as Stage II (20%), 8 as Stage III (4%), and 17 as Stage IV (9%). One hundred eighty patients had classic seminoma and 17 had anaplastic seminoma. All patients underwent high inguinal orchiectomy before treatment. Seven patients with Stages III and IV received chemotherapy before RT. Patients with Stages I and II were treated with 40-Gy photons to paraaortic and parailiac fields. Ten patients with Stage III and IV seminoma received 30-Gy photons to mediastinal and supraclavicular fields as well. Sixty patients received additional inguinal RT. The overall 5-year survival rate (corrected for intercurrent death, except for treatment toxicity) was 100% for Stage I, 100% for Stage II, 87% for Stage III, and 87% for Stage IV. The mean follow-up time was 6.3 years (range, 0.6 to 11.9 years). An evaluation of all patients showed no difference according to histologic condition or prior chemotherapy. Mediastinal and supraclavicular irradiation showed no improvement in treatment results. Acute toxicity consisted of mild to moderate emesis, increased bowel frequency, erythema, and, in four cases leucopenia and thrombopenia (all World Health Organization [WHO] Grades I to II). However, one patient died of a pulmonary fibrosis 1 month after mediastinal irradiation and 2 months after polychemotherapy, and a gastroduodenal ulcer developed in another patient 1.5 months after paraaortic RT and prior polychemotherapy. Overall, the data suggest that to avoid overtreatment and consecutive treatment morbidity reduced doses of 30 Gy and a restrictive treatment planning adapted to the individual risk are sufficient for RT for testicular seminoma. An alternative to postoperative RT in Stage I (and possibly Stage II) seminoma could be no RT, but close follow-up instead.\r"

Serum albumin concentration was used as a biochemical indicator of protein status. Some children had muscle wasting before diagnosis. The highest degree of muscle wasting developed by 4 to 6 weeks with an average of 27% decrease of the muscle index. Because of simultaneous increase of adipose tissue (average, 33% at 6 weeks and 37% at 12 weeks), the relative body weight or the limb circumferences did not decrease. Muscle mass recovery occurred within the next 6 months. Our data emphasize that changes in the relative body weight or limb circumferences do not reveal nutritional protein depletion and muscle wasting that occurs in children with newly diagnosed acute leukemia.\r"

After intravenous administration, elderly patients had prolonged elimination half-life values (58 +/- 11 versus 42 +/- 8 hours; p less than 0.01) caused by decreased clearance (19 +/- 5 versus 25 +/- 7 L/hr; p less than 0.01). After a 3-months oral treatment washout period, half-life tended to be prolonged in the elderly patients (69 +/- 20 hours for the elderly patients versus 53 +/- 14 hours for the young patients; difference not significant) and was not markedly different from the short-term intravenous measurement. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly decreased from baseline throughout the treatment period, with greater decreases in elderly patients for both systolic and diastolic pressure. When amlodipine plasma concentration was correlated to change in mean blood pressure after short-term intravenous doses, elderly patients had a greater decrease than young patients at a given drug concentration. However, after long-term oral administration, elderly and young patients had comparable decreases in mean blood pressure at a given drug concentration, and the increased antihypertensive effect in the elderly was associated with somewhat higher amlodipine plasma concentration. Amlodipine administered once daily is an effective antihypertensive agent in elderly patients and young patients with essential hypertension.\r"

Among children with seizures in the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke Collaborative Perinatal Project (NCPP), one individual with SMEI was identified. This finding from the NCPP suggests that the incidence of SMEI is approximately 1 in 40,000 children.

Thirteen female epilepsy patients receiving long-term CBZ monotherapy (mean medication duration 5.3 years) were also studied. Controls were 17 regularly menstruating healthy volunteers. Untreated patients had higher free testosterone (FT) and luteinizing hormone (LH) serum concentrations than control subjects, whereas the other parameters did not differ between these two groups. However, serum sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels increased and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels decreased during CBZ treatment. Although calculated free androgen index (FAI) decreased during CBZ therapy, the directly measured FT levels remained unaltered. These changes were found after 2 months and continued after 12 months of CBZ treatment. Moreover, patients with long-term CBZ also had high SHBG levels, low serum DHEAS levels, and low FAI values. Basal LH serum levels decreased during the first year of CBZ treatment and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH)-stimulated LH concentrations were lower after 2 months of CBZ treatment. Although the serum basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and prolactin (PRL) levels were unaffected during the first year of CBZ therapy, the LH-RH-stimulated FSH concentrations and metoclopramide (MC)-stimulated PRL concentrations were lower after 12 months of CBZ treatment than before CBZ. Both basal and stimulated gonadotropin and PRL serum levels of long-term CBZ patients were unaffected. No changes were found in estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), or cortisol (C) serum concentrations during short or long-term CBZ treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The clearance of SUCA was dose-dependent, although the observed nonlinearity did not appear to be due to classical saturable elimination. The change in clearance across doses was consistent with end-product inhibition or cosubstrate depletion. The volume of distribution of the spiro compound also evidenced nonlinearity, possibly due to concentration-dependent binding to serum proteins. In contrast, the dose-dependent clearance displayed by VPA was composed of both saturable and nonsaturable components. Furthermore, the disposition of VPA was characterized by a significant enterohepatic recirculation, whereas no such recirculatory process was apparent for SUCA. Both compounds afforded significant protection from pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures, and the time course of anticonvulsant effect did not correspond to that of drug concentrations in serum for either anticonvulsant. The apparent dissociation between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VPA may be a function of the mechanism of antiepileptic action and not due to the presence of active metabolites of the drug.\r"

The results indicate that ADD 55051 is a very effective anticonvulsant in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model in mice after either intraperitoneal (i.p.) or oral administration and in rats after oral administration. In mice treated i.p. or orally, ADD 55051 was also effective in preventing seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). The toxicity of ADD 55051 after oral administration was quite low, yielding high TD50 values in both mice and rats and producing a very high protective index (PI = TD50/ED50) in both species as compared with the prototype antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).\r"

  ".W": "The action of toxins A, B, and C from Clostridium difficile was studied in the small intestine and colon of rats. All three caused fluid accumulation in the small intestine, maximal secretion being induced by 1 micrograms of toxin A, 20 micrograms of B, and 15 micrograms of C. Both toxins A and C caused shedding of epithelial cells from the villi without visible damage to crypt cells; toxin A caused further extensive necrosis and bleeding. Toxin B caused secretion without visible damage to the epithelial cells, though this activity was unstable and decreased significantly after one week of storage. In the colon, toxin A caused secretion and shedding of surface epithelial cells without damage to crypt cells, toxin C caused only a weak secretion, and toxin B had no effect at all. In terms of immunohistochemistry, it was found that toxin A bound to the enterocytes at the tips of the villi but not to goblet and crypt cells. The complex expression or interaction of the toxins produced by Cl difficile may explain the broad spectrum of disease (diarrhoea, colitis, and pseudomembranous colitis) associated with this micro-organism.\r"

Thirty-seven FF samples containing mature oocyte-corona-cumulus complexes were used to measure steroids, gonadotropins, and cAMP. The FF specimens were divided into three groups: follicles yielding ova that were fertilized and cleaved (group A), follicles containing fertilized ova without further cleavage (group B), and follicles containing nonfertilized oocytes (group C). The FF levels of progesterone, 17 beta-estradiol, LH/hCG, and FSH did not differ significantly among the groups. Mean FF cAMP concentrations declined from 17.5 +/- 2.5 pmol/mL 15 min after follicle aspiration to 3.6 +/- 0.9 pmol/mL after 3 h. The initial FF cAMP concentration did not differ significantly among three groups. However, the cAMP degradation rate in group A (119 +/- 13 X 10(-4) pmol/min) was significantly greater than that in group B (62 +/- 10 X 10(-4) pmol/min) or group C (75 +/- 8 X 10(-4) pmol/min). In conclusion, an increased intrafollicular cAMP degradation rate was associated with successful fertilization and cleavage of human oocytes in vitro. These data suggest that the degradation rate of FF cAMP may be a marker of optimal follicular development and oocyte maturation.\r"

The average plasma inhibin concentrations in pregnant women throughout pregnancy (minimum, 2.25 +/- 0.48 IU/mL at 17 weeks gestation; maximum, 24.15 +/- 6.99 IU/mL at 39 weeks gestation) were much higher than those in nonpregnant women with a normal menstrual cycle (0.46 +/- 0.04 IU/mL in the midfollicular phase and 2.02 +/- 0.47 IU/mL in the midluteal phase). The inhibin concentrations were already high at 5 weeks gestation (7.54 +/- 1.10 IU/mL) and rose to peak at 8-10 weeks gestation. The concentrations then decreased and remained relatively low during 14-30 weeks gestation, but rose again during the third trimester. The inhibin concentrations decreased to undetectable levels after delivery. Immunoreactive inhibin was demonstrated in the corpus luteum and term placental extracts, and the dose-response curves were parallel to an inhibin preparation from human follicular fluid. Immunoreactive inhibin concentrations were also high in both the umbilical vein and artery (7.77 +/- 0.80 and 7.84 +/- 0.78 IU/mL, respectively). These observations suggest that both the corpus luteum and placenta are likely sources of inhibin.\r"

Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels are frequently elevated in patients with severe CHF and may act to counterbalance these hormonal actions. To determine whether CHF patients maintain a physiological response to the presumed major stimulus to ANP secretion, atrial stretch, 22 CHF patients and 8 normal volunteers were studied. Atrial distention was produced in 10 CHF patients with a mannitol infusion and in 12 with lower body positive pressure. Eight normal volunteers also underwent a mannitol infusion. Both stimuli provoked increases in plasma ANP levels in the CHF patients, and the relative increase in plasma ANP after mannitol was similar in the CHF patients and the normal volunteers. We conclude that ANP secretion responds to atrial stretch in CHF patients, suggesting maintenance of the physiological release of this peptide.\r"

In this study we examined the effects of IL-1, TNF, and IFN gamma on the viability and hormone secretion of islets isolated from adult human pancreas and maintained in monolayer culture. IL-1 and TNF were cytotoxic to the islet cells (20-30% cell lysis) in a 51Cr release cytotoxicity assay, and IFN gamma had only small effects (less than 10% lysis). Combination of maximally cytotoxic concentrations of IL-1 (10 U/mL) and TNF (10(3) U/mL) produced an additive cytotoxic effect. IFN gamma (10(3) U/mL) acted synergistically with IL-1 and TNF, and the three cytokines added together produced maximal islet cell lysis (46.4 +/- 4.3%). Assay of insulin and glucagon in the islet monolayers revealed that IL-1, TNF, and IFN gamma inhibited both B- and A-cell secretory functions; however, only IL-1 and TNF produced permanent decreases in insulin and glucagon contents in the islet cultures. These findings indicate that IL-1 and TNF, as single agents, are cytotoxic to human islet cells, and that this cytotoxicity can be amplified by combining the cytokines and/or adding IFN gamma. However, the lack of specificity for B-cells in vitro suggests that additional factors might be operative in vivo for the cytokine products of macrophages and lymphocytes infiltrating islets to produce the B-cell-specific damage characteristic of type 1 diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of prior exposure to somatostatin (SRIH) on its inhibition of GH and TSH responses to GHRH and TRH stimulation to determine whether SRIH desensitization has physiological significance in man. Six men received GHRH (1 microgram/kg, iv) and TRH (0.3 microgram/kg, iv) 20 min after starting a saline or SRIH (5.5 ng/kg/min, iv) infusion and again 6 h later. Hormone responses were quantified by measuring the area under the curve, corrected for GH concentration at injection time. Similar results were obtained when GH responses were quantified by measuring the hormone secretory rate using the program Detect. Plasma GH and TSH responses to the two GHRH and TRH injections during saline were similar. However, the effects of prior exposure to SRIH were hormone specific. SRIH blunted GH responses to GHRH at 20 min (1609 +/- 286 micrograms/L.min vs. 451 +/- 224), but did not significantly inhibit the responses 6 h later (1422 +/- 410 micrograms/L.min vs. 1000 +/- 302). In contrast, SRIH inhibition of TSH responses to the two TRH injections was similar (first, 946 +/- 201 micrograms/L.min vs. 700 +/- 148; second, 813 +/- 175 micrograms/L.min vs. 562 +/- 66). We next used these results to study whether the previously reported attenuation of GH responses to repeated GHRH stimulation at 2-h intervals is mediated by SRIH. Eight men received GHRH (1 microgram/kg, iv) 380 min after starting a saline or SRIH (5.5 ng/kg/min, iv) infusion or 90 min after starting a primed (5 mg, iv) infusion of propranolol (80 micrograms/min, iv) and again 2 h later. As in the first protocol, GH responses to GHRH were not inhibited when preceded by a 6-h SRIH infusion. However, the 6-h SRIH infusion resulted in a partial restoration of plasma GH responses to the second GHRH injection (saline infusion: first, 1429 +/- 342 micrograms/L.min; second, 254 +/- 75; SRIH infusion: first, 1042 +/- 247 micrograms/L.min; second, 468 +/- 105). beta-Blockade by propranolol resulted in enhanced GH responses to GHRH, but did not prevent the attenuation of GH responses to the second GHRH injection (first, 1937 +/- 366 micrograms/L.min; second, 614 +/- 99). The desensitization to SRIH inhibition of GH responses to GHRH after a 6-h SRIH infusion provides evidence of physiological consequences of SRIH receptor down-regulation. The impaired GH responses to repeated GHRH stimulation are mediated at least in part by enhanced SRIH secretion, which appears independent of a beta-adrenergic mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that immunosuppressive acidic protein (IAP), an alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, is increased during the acute phase of subacute thyroiditis (SAT). In this study we measured the percentage and absolute number of peripheral K-cells using a plaque-forming cell technique to investigate immunological abnormalities associated with SAT. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between IAP and peripheral K-cell activity. In normal controls, a sex-related difference in the percentage of K-cells among total lymphocytes was present; the percentage was significantly lower in women (mean +/- SD, 5.0 +/- 2.0%; n = 12; P less than 0.01) than in men (8.4 +/- 2.9%; n = 13). However, there was no difference (0.153 +/- 0.073 x 10(9)/L in five females; 0.173 +/- 0.054 x 10(9)/L in seven males) in the absolute number of peripheral K-cells. During the acute phase of SAT, the percentage (2.4 +/- 1.9% in 16 females; 2.7 +/- 1.0% in 3 males) and absolute number (0.058 +/- 0.048 x 10(9)/L in 11 females) of K-cells were significantly lower than those in normal controls. These values returned to normal during the recovery phase, although their mean values were still lower than those in normal controls. In female patients with Graves' disease, the percentage (2.2 +/- 1.8%  in 11 females) and absolute number (0.038 +/- 0.033 x 10(9)/L in 11 females) of K-cells were significantly lower than those in normal controls; in male patients, the percentage (4.2 +/- 2.7% in 5 males) was lower than that in normal controls, but the absolute number (0.136 +/- 0.114 x 10(9)/L) of K-cells was not significantly different. Serum IAP values during the acute phase of SAT showed a significant negative correlation with the percentage of K-cells (r = -0.66; P less than 0.01). The number of K-cells from a normal subject decreased significantly when these lymphocytes were incubated with sera from patients with SAT, and the mean inhibition rate of K-cells by serum samples from 13 SAT patients during the acute phase was higher than that during the recovery phase (68.0 +/- 21.0 vs. 38.0 +/- 23.0%; P less than 0.01). Purified IAP inhibited the activity of K-cells from normal subjects dose dependently. These results suggest that 1) there may be inhibitory factors for the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of peripheral K-cells in the serum of patients with SAT, and 2) IAP may be one of these inhibitory factors.\r"

Eighteen had elevated levels of TBII, and 232 who had negative TBII levels also agreed to be followed for a period of 6-30 months. TBII was chosen as the critical screening measurement for this study, rather than thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAb) and thyroid-stimulating blocking antibodies (TSBAb), because of the availability and ease of use of TBII RIA kits. Eleven of the 18 subjects with elevated TBII were T3 nonsuppressible (group I), and 10 of the 11 were TRH unresponsive. Nine of these 10 subjects showed TSH levels below 0.05 mU/L. The remaining 7 subjects were T3 suppressible and TRH responsive (group II). Alterations in thyroid status occurred in 8 of the 11 subjects in group I during follow-up. One developed hypothyroidism, and 7 became hyperthyroid. The hypothyroid subject had initial titers of TBII, TSAb, and TSBAb that were markedly elevated, and TSAb disappeared when she became hypothyroid. Six of the 7 subjects who developed hyperthyroidism had elevated TSAb and negative TSBAb titers while they were euthyroid. All 7 subjects in group II remained euthyroid during the follow-up period. Only 2 of the 232 relatives who initially had negative TBII titers became hyperthyroid during the follow-up period. The results indicate that euthyroid relatives with a family history of Graves' disease who have elevated TBII levels and suppressed basal serum TSH concentrations have a much higher potential to develop hyperthyroidism than those who have normal or negative TBII levels.\r"

Three different regimens (6 x 100 mg, 6 x 200 mg; and 3 x 200 mg) were compared in a prospective, cross-over clinical trial in which androgen deficient men were administered the three-dose combinations in a randomized starting order at intervals of at least 6 months. Plasma free and total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, LH, and FSH were measured before and at monthly intervals for at least 6 months after 111 pellet implantation in 43 men with hypergonadotropic (n = 22) or hypogonadotropic (n = 21) hypogonadism. Total and free testosterone levels peaked at the first month and were maintained at physiological levels for 4 to 5 (600 mg doses) or 6 (1200 mg dose) months after a single implantation. Absorption of testosterone from 100 mg and 200 mg pellets closely approximated zero-order throughout the effective life of the pellets and exhibited a half-duration of 2.5 months. The estimated rate of release of testosterone was 1.5 (95% confidence limits 1.3-1.6) mg/day.200 mg pellet as determined from direct measurement of residue in pellets recovered after extrusion and confirmed independently from percent absorbed-time plots. The bioavailability of testosterone was virtually complete and the time course was predictable from the total implant dose and, to a lesser extent, total initial surface areas of pellets. Despite wide fluctuations in testosterone, SHBG levels were not changed during 6 months. In men with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, both LH and FSH levels were uniformly and markedly suppressed by increased testosterone after pellet implants. LH and FSH were highly correlated with each other (r = 0.87) and inversely with total (r = 0.47 and 0.45, respectively) and free (r = 0.46 and 0.47) testosterone levels. Nadir LH levels occurred at 1-3 months (600 mg) and 1-4 months (1200 mg) reaching levels comparable with eugonadal controls. In contrast nadir FSH levels occurred at similar times but remained elevated compared with eugonadal controls. We conclude that fused pellets of crystalline testosterone provides very satisfactory depot androgen replacement exhibiting many desirable features for androgen replacement.\r"

Follicular development was monitored by serial ultrasound examinations, and the onset of ovulation was regulated by an injection of hCG. Follicular fluid was aspirated during sterilization by minilaparotomy, which was performed just before the expected time of ovulation. Prostaglandin E2 and PGF2 alpha levels in the fluid were significantly reduced by indomethacin and bromfenac compared to those after placebo treatment. Bromfenac also reduced the follicular fluid leukotriene B4 level. Therefore, the development of luteinized unruptured follicles after treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs appears to be associated with a significant decrease in the synthesis of ovarian eicosanoids.\r"

They had nothing by mouth after midnight and were admitted to the Clinical Research Center at 0800 h. They voided, were weighed, and had their blood pressure and pulse measured in the recumbent and upright positions. A needle was inserted, and subjects were recumbent for 0.5 h, after which blood was drawn for measurement of plasma ANH, serum sodium, potassium, and (in 35 subjects) creatinine. They were then given 150 mL 0.14% sodium chloride solution to drink every 0.5 h for the next 6 h. Urine was collected every 0.5 h for measurement of sodium, potassium, and creatinine. After 4 h of recumbency repeat blood samples were drawn, subjects ambulated for 2 h, after which final repeat blood samples were drawn.

The clinical characteristics of the 34 patients with postural edema and 31 patients with a normal response were similar. Plasma ANH levels (initial, after oral saline, and after standing) were similar in the two groups, and there was no relationship between changes in ANH and urinary sodium with standing. In conclusion, under conditions of mild oral sodium chloride loading, changes in plasma ANH do not cause the abnormal sodium retention found in patients with postural edema.\r"

The quantitative response of TRH-Gly-stimulated PRL, TSH, and GH was evaluated in nine patients with anorexia nervosa, six age-matched normal women, eight patients with uremia, five patients with acromegaly, and two patients with prolactinoma. Intravenous injection (500 micrograms) of TRH-Gly caused a 2.6-fold increase in PRL secretion in patients with anorexia nervosa (basal level, 10.0 +/- 1.4 vs. 25.9 +/- 2.5 micrograms/L 15 min after injection; P less than 0.01). In contrast, no significant change was observed in TRH-Gly-stimulated PRL secretion in normal women (basal level, 13.5 +/- 2.3 vs. 15.3 +/- 2.5 micrograms/L 15 min after injection; P greater than 0.05). TRH-Gly did not alter PRL levels in patients with uremia, acromegaly, or prolactinoma. Secretion of TSH, but not GH, was slightly increased by TRH-Gly injection in patients with anorexia nervosa (basal level, 1.41 +/- 0.13 vs. 2.86 +/- 0.22 min/L 30 min after injection; P less than 0.01), whereas no significant secretory response was observed in normal women. These data provide evidence that PRL secretion in anorectic patients is quantitatively different from that in normal persons.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether there was a significant relationship between circulating lipids or lipoproteins and circulating estrogens or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in pre- and premenopausal women, 352 women were chosen randomly from communities in Eastern Massachusetts. These women had nonfasting blood samples drawn and analyzed for total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), HDL-2, HDL-3, apolipoprotein-A-I (apo-A-I), apo-B, triglycerides (TG), estrone, estradiol (E2), free E2, SHBG, and FSH. In addition, their body mass index (BMI; wt/ht2) was calculated, and a history of smoking, ethanol intake, current medication use, and the date of their last menstrual period was obtained. When the women were grouped according to the months from their last menses (less than 1, 1-3, and 4-11 months), those 4 months or longer since last menses had significantly lower E2 concentrations and significantly greater total cholesterol and FSH concentrations than the other two groups. However, when regressed on hormones, BMI, ethanol intake, and last menstrual period, total cholesterol was significantly related only to the time from last menses; TG, HDL-C, HDL-2, and apo-A-I were related to SHBG. Relationships between the lipids, with the exception of cholesterol and apo-B, were also noted with BMI and/or ethanol. Apo-B was related to the time from last menses. Differences in circulating estrogens appeared to be related only minimally, if at all, to the differences in total cholesterol that are seen in perimenopausal women. The relationships between lipids and lipoproteins and SHBG are probably epiphenomena as a result of similar sites of synthesis. Changes in lipids and lipoproteins that are seen at the time of the menopause are probably multifactorial in origin.\r"

  ".W": "As a preliminary step in searching for a pharmacological treatment for gonadotroph adenomas, we administered the GnRH antagonist analog Nal-Glu GnRH to five patients, four men and a woman, with FSH-secreting gonadotroph adenomas in order to determine its effect on FSH secretion. Administration of a single 10-mg dose of Nal-Glu GnRH to four of the patients produced a significant decrease in the serum FSH concentration in two patients and returned the FSH level to normal in only one. Administration of 5 mg Nal-Glu every 12 h for 7 days, however, produced a significant (P less than 0.001) decrease, and to within the normal range, in four of the five patients (mean +/- SEM, 32.7 +/- 5.6 IU/L during the 3 days before treatment and 9.8 +/- 1.4 IU/L during the last 3 days of treatment). Also, in response to the 7-day treatment, LH fell significantly in all five patients, alpha-subunit fell in three, and testosterone fell in all four men. Administration for 6 weeks of the GnRH agonist analog leuprolide did not decrease the serum FSH concentration of one of the patients whose serum FSH did decrease in response to Nal-Glu GnRH. We conclude that repetitive administration of Nal-Glu GnRH may often inhibit FSH secretion by gonadotroph adenomas and that FSH secretion by gonadotroph adenomas may be dependent on endogenous GnRH secretion.\r"

GFR estimated with 51Cr-EDTA was closely correlated with single serum creatinine measurements and the inverse of serum beta 2 microglobulin. Creatinine clearance was also found to be correlated, but values were, on average, 32% below those obtained by the 51Cr-EDTA method, and this difference was significant. It is concluded that measurements of beta 2 microglobulin, single serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance are valuable indicators of GFR in homozygous sickle cell disease. Measurement of beta 2 microglobulin was a useful and reliable method of estimating GFR from single plasma measurements and is therefore a useful means of screening the population.\r"

Assays on four inhibitor negative haemophiliac patients were also negative by the skin puncture method. Sample dilution at the collection stage results in loss of sensitivity to inhibitor concentrations below 1 unit/ml, but the technique will be of value in monitoring higher concentrations when venous access is difficult and must be saved for parenteral treatment.\r"

One hundred seventeen older subjects underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment that included administration of the WMT and questionnaires assessing current service use. Study participants returned at 6 and 12 months for repeat measurement of study variables. The WMT was found to be a significant predictor of additional service use at 12 months (chi 2 = 6.4, P less than .01). The test had high specificity (83%) but relatively low sensitivity (40%). The lack of sensitivity in this study group was likely due to high levels of stress among caregivers whose relative was otherwise not predicted to need services. When the WMT was repeated after 6 and 12 months, the results were highly reproducible. The WMT appears to be a useful predictor of increasing formal service use. However, in certain study groups, its predictive ability may be affected by high levels of caregiver stress.\r"

Among bedfast patients, 47% of women and 58% of men and, among patients with decubitus ulcers, 37% of women and 33% of men were using a urine collection device. The indwelling urethral catheter was the most commonly used device. Indeed, for women, few other options were available: 93% of women used this device. In women, multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that presence of a decubitus ulcer and occupation of a long-term care bed were the attributes most strongly associated with the use of the urethral catheter. Of men with urine collection devices, 43% were using the urethral catheter; poor mobility status was the characteristic most strongly associated with its use. Long-term urethral catheterization has been well studied and is associated with universal bacteriuria and with a number of complications. Options need to be further explored, particularly external urine collection devices for women. Furthermore, because urethral catheterization may be used as a management technique for decubitus ulcers, prevention of the latter may diminish the use of urethral catheters and their subsequent complications.\r"
