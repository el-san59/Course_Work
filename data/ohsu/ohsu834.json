The increase in avidity is rapid and transient, providing a dynamic mechanism for antigen-specific regulation of lymphocyte adhesion and de-adhesion.\r"

  ".U": "90015217\r", 
  ".W": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a widely studied model of the synaptic basis of information storage in the mammalian brain. The induction of LTP is triggered by the postsynaptic entry of calcium through the channel associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, whereas its maintenance is mediated, at least in part, by presynaptic mechanisms. To explain how postsynaptic events can lead to an increase in transmitter release, we have postulated the existence of a retrograde messenger to carry information from the postsynaptic side of the synapse to recently active presynaptic terminals. Candidates for a retrograde messenger include arachidonic acid or one of its lipoxygenase metabolites. Here we report that weak activation of the perforant path, when given in the presence of arachidonic acid, leads to a slow-onset persistent increase in synaptic efficacy both in vivo and in vitro. The activity-dependent potentiation thus produced is accompanied by an increase in the release of glutamate, and is non-additive with tetanus-induced LTP. These observations indicate a role for arachidonic acid as a retrograde messenger in the later, but not the initial, stages of LTP.\r"

Using the standard Brown-Roberts-Wells system allows a) precisely planned cortical entries, b) gross total lesion excisions under direct vision, c) use of probe-guided resection margins, d) small craniotomies through linear incisions, and e) use of local anesthetic alone for resections. The method and results of this universally available and relatively inexpensive technique are discussed in reference to 20 patients.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of an intracranial arteriovenous malformation has a dramatic impact on local circulatory dynamics. Treatment of some arteriovenous malformations can result in disastrous hyperemic states caused by redistribution of previously shunted blood. This report describes serial hemodynamic measurements of both cerebral blood flow and flow velocity in 3 patients during treatment for arteriovenous malformations. Measurements of cerebral blood flow were made by computed tomographic scan employing the stable xenon inhalation technique; flow velocity, including autoregulatory characteristics, was measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonogram. Substantial hyperemia developed in one patient (Case 1) after resection and in another (Case 3) after embolization. Embolization resulted in restoration of normal regional cerebral blood flow in a patient who demonstrated hypoperfusion before treatment (Case 2). In Patient 1, postoperative hyperemia was associated with persistently elevated flow velocities, and may have been accompanied by hemispheric neurological deficits. Sequential hemodynamic measurements may predict patients at risk of perioperative complications, and may become useful clinical guidelines for the extent and timing of embolization and for the timing of surgery after intracranial hemorrhage or preoperative embolization procedures.\r"

Extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass grafting remains an essential procedure in the treatment of many cerebrovascular conditions, including Moya Moya disease and giant intracranial aneurysms. The efficacy of interposition vein grafts, as well as the EC-IC bypass in the treatment of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, acute cerebral ischemia, cerebral vasospasm, and multi-infarct dementia, remains to be determined. Several alternative revascularization procedures, including proximal MCA anastomosis and omental transposition, are in development.\r"

Symptoms began in childhood and did not progress. Electromyographic findings were consistent with myopathy while muscle biopsies showed nonspecific myopathic changes without evidence of storage of glycogen or lipid. Analysis of DNA revealed a deletion in the 1st third of the dystrophin gene. Western blot analysis revealed that dystrophin was smaller than that in normal samples, with no reduction in the amount of the protein present. This disorder represents a new clinical phenotype associated with a deletion in the dystrophin gene. This deletion affects a portion of the dystrophin molecule that clinically does not appear to significantly alter its function. Other patients with deletions in this region may have truncated dystrophin without clinical signs of progressive muscle disease.\r"

Individual channel EEG frequency analysis variables that were helpful in differentiating the 2 groups were absolute delta and theta band power, relative delta, theta, and alpha band powers, and median-power frequency. High-frequency beta band power (20 to 32 Hz) was not useful. Changes in EEG with age were seen only after age 50 and generally consisted of an increase in anterior alpha power, with no significant increase in slowing. Correlations of C-EEGFA variables with posterior alpha power were more significant than correlations with age. Calculating normative C-EEGFA data for 5 subsets of controls, each with a different amount of posterior alpha power, increased the sensitivity of the EEG frequency analysis test without altering the specificity. Even with this correction 2 of 20 patients with focal lesions and focally abnormal conventional EEGs had normal C-EEGFA studies. If these obvious focal lesions produced normal results, more subtle diseases might not be detected. A significant clinical utility of C-EEGFA remains to be proven.\r"

Our patients demonstrated increased beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, and fibrinogen compared with age-matched controls. Eight patients developed progression of carotid stenosis, and this group had higher baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and fibrinogen than the 30 nonprogressing patients. Multiple regression analyses of age, sex, smoking, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and baseline high-density lipoprotein (HDL), HDL2, HDL3, LDL, beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, and fibrinogen identified coronary artery disease and elevated LDL and fibrinogen as the only independent variables significantly associated with the progressing group. We conclude that, in patients with carotid atherosclerosis, a combination of coronary artery disease and elevated LDL and fibrinogen will predict with 88% accuracy whether the patient will have progressing carotid stenosis.\r"

We recovered a transmissible pathogen (Echigo-1 strain) from an autopsy specimen of the patient's brain and passed it serially in Hartley guinea pigs. After a long latent period, it caused degenerative changes, mainly in the thalamic area of the guinea pig brain. On the 4th passage, a substrain emerged with a short latent period. When cross-transmitted to Golden Syrian hamsters, this substrain induced severe degeneration in both the thalamus and cerebral cortex. We compare our results with those for other experimental CJDs produced by other types of this disease.\r"

These MRAs are displayed like conventional arteriograms, but are acquired in a noninvasive fashion with a minimal increase in examination time. We used MRA to visualize 50 of 54 carotid bifurcations tested, with good correlation to the intra-arterial angiograms. We examined the intracranial vasculature in over 40 patients, and demonstrated aneurysms, vascular malformations, and occlusions.\r"

Labor was documented by three contractions in 20 minutes, cervical dilation of 1 cm or more, and the need for parenteral tocolysis. Enrollment was restricted to patients with intact membranes and without known causes for preterm labor. One hundred three patients at 24-34 weeks' gestation were randomized to intravenous ampicillin plus oral erythromycin or corresponding placebos. Compared with the placebo group, the adjunctive antibiotic group had a similar frequency of preterm birth (38 versus 44%), time to delivery (34 versus 34 days), birth weight (2847 versus 2855 g), and episodes of recurrent labor requiring parenteral tocolysis (0.43 versus 0.49). In our population, we found no benefit to the adjunctive use of ampicillin plus erythromycin. Significant differences in genital microflora between our patients and those of other studies may explain our results.\r"

The relative efficacy, maternal and neonatal safety, and costs were evaluated to determine which may be the more appropriate first-line pharmacologic agent used to manage preterm labor. Fifty-four patients and 52 patients were randomized to receive ritodrine hydrochloride or indomethacin, respectively. Ritodrine hydrochloride and indomethacin were equally effective in inhibiting uterine contractions and delaying delivery. Delivery was delayed for at least 48 hours in 83 and 94%, and for at least 7 days in 70 and 75% of patients receiving ritodrine or indomethacin, respectively. Tocolysis with indomethacin was associated with no maternal side effects, whereas tocolysis with ritodrine hydrochloride was associated with a 24% incidence of serious cardiovascular and metabolic adverse effects prompting discontinuation of the drug. There were no differences in outcome between the infants exposed to indomethacin versus ritodrine hydrochloride when delivered either remote from therapy or during therapy, except for a statistically higher serum glucose in the infants exposed to ritodrine hydrochloride when delivered during tocolytic therapy. There were no cases of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus or pulmonary hypertension. Tocolysis with indomethacin was 17 times less costly than tocolysis with ritodrine hydrochloride. For gestations less than or equal to 32 weeks complicated by preterm labor, indomethacin may be an appropriate alternative as a first-line tocolytic agent.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that bacteria and polymorphonuclear neutrophils may have both separate and combined effects in weakening the amniochorionic membrane, and thus predispose to premature rupture of membranes. We examined how three parameters of membrane integrity (bursting tension, work to rupture, and elasticity) were affected by standardized preparations (10(9) cfu/mL) of group B streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus in the presence or absence of purified human neutrophils (32 x 10(6)/mL). In addition, effects of purified human neutrophil elastase were evaluated. Exposure to either group B streptococcus or S aureus decreased membrane strength, elasticity, and work to rupture. Only activated neutrophils had significant effects on membrane strength. Membrane exposure to S aureus plus neutrophils led to an additive weakening of fetal membranes. On the other hand, group B streptococci did not interact with neutrophils to yield a significant further weakening of the membranes. Elastase (150 U/mL) also weakened the membrane. The results were correlated with measures of protease (Azocoll and ninhydrin assays) and peroxidase (dimethoxybenzidine) activity. Our findings support the concept that human neutrophils and their constituent enzymes may act in concert with bacteria and their protease(s) in weakening amniochorion, and may possibly predispose to premature rupture of membranes in some women. These observations require clinical correlations.\r"

Significant variation in cephalic index was found with advancing gestational age, with the highest and lowest values observed at 14 and 28 weeks, respectively.

After exclusion of anemic, hypoxic, and chromosomally abnormal fetuses, the MCV in 208 umbilical venous samples was shown to decrease with gestation (r = 0.64; P less than .001), and a normal range was constructed by linear regression analysis. An elevated MCV was found in both fetuses with triploidy, in four of five with monosomy X, and in four of ten with trisomies 18 or 21. The MCV was similarly raised in four of five fetuses with gross anomalies in whom cytogenetic cultures had failed. Significant correlations were found in chromosomally abnormal fetuses between the elevation in MCV and both the nucleated red cell (r = 0.69; P less than .01) and reticulocyte counts (r = 0.57; P less than .05). There was a similar correlation with nucleated red cells in 16 severely anemic fetuses with Rh disease, 12 of whom had a raised MCV. Elevation in MCV was unrelated to hypoxia. Macrocytosis had a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 95% in the second trimester for predicting an abnormal karyotype in nonanemic fetuses (kappa index 0.60). Fetal MCV may provide clinically useful information while one awaits culture results. We suggest that karyotyping be considered in fetuses undergoing blood sampling for other indications in whom the MCV is raised.\r"

Using our normative data, the sensitivity and specificity of the BPD/femur length ratio were 36.4 and 93.4%, respectively. Assuming an incidence of Down syndrome in the general population of one in 1000, the estimated positive predictive value was 0.6%. When the BPD/femur length ratio, nuchal skin thickening, and measured-to-expected femur length ratio were combined, the sensitivity was improved (36.4 versus 45.5%) without significantly altering the specificity (93.4% versus 92.3%). A large prospective study is required to verify the utility of sonographic predictors of Down syndrome before their application can be recommended.\r"

The short- and long-term morbidity in these two groups were compared and 12-month follow-up was completed. The use of sutures did not reduce the incidence of primary hemorrhage. Secondary hemorrhage was twice as frequent in the suture group, although this trend did not quite reach statistical significance. During long-term follow-up, significantly more patients in the suture group developed menstrual symptoms, cervical stenosis, and unsatisfactory colposcopy, requiring further operative intervention as a result.\r"

Nevertheless, the subject merits careful attention because of the broad spectrum of diseases these cases represent, the potential for transmission of other disorders, and the difficulties in diagnosis they pose. Infections, neoplastic diseases, and corneal disorders may be acquired by corneal transplantation. Very serious are viral infections, but only rabies, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and hepatitis B have had documented transmission. Bacterial and fungal infections are a clear hazard to the graft. On rare occasions, the recipient has died. Although the transmission of local corneal disorders and dystrophies has yet to be documented, the potential seems clear, particularly with tissue from young donors where evidence for dystrophies, such as keratoconus and Fuchs' dystrophy, has yet to appear. Fortunately, in the United States, screening techniques appear to be largely effective in detecting donors who harbor diseases that are potentially transmittable.\r"

In all cases, insufficient capsular material was present to provide adequate fixation for the implant. Lenses were placed in 72 aphakic eyes as a secondary implant, and 159 lenses were placed after removal of another implant. Follow-up ranged from 1 year to 68 months with 59.5% of patients achieving visual acuity of 20/40 or better, and 74% of 20/80 or better. Suture-fixating a PC IOL to the iris offers multiple advantages over placement of an anterior chamber lens during PKP. The complication rate appears low, and long-term problems with glaucoma and recurrent corneal decompensation should be reduced.\r"

Once diagnosed, subtalar instability symptoms can be treated by either nonoperative or operative means.\r"

Finally, the results of late reconstruction equal those of early repair.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the tremendous research advances that have increased our knowledge regarding the pharmacodynamics, clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects of stimulant medications in the treatment of children with ADHD, our knowledge is yet incomplete. Perhaps the most central unresolved issue concerns our understanding of the pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of ADHD. This review has touched briefly on the controversy and confusion surrounding this issue. Although our understanding of the use of stimulant medications in this disorder is similarly incomplete, a review of the literature does allow certain conclusions to be made that are helpful to the practitioner. 1. Stimulant medications are an effective treatment modality for most children with ADHD. Short-term efficacy is well documented, and long-term outcome may be improved when stimulants are used with other therapeutic strategies. Stimulants in and of themselves are not a panacea. 2. It is impossible to predict which children will have a favorable response to stimulant medications and which children may have a placebo response. The use of individual single-blind medication trials is a practical solution to this problem and should be considered for all children who are candidates for stimulant therapy as a means for preventing overuse or inappropriate use of these medications. 3. The precise mechanism of action of stimulants is not yet completely understood, but stimulants appear to exert their therapeutic effects through their influence on multiple neurotransmitters in the catecholamine, dopamine, norepinephrine axis in the central nervous system. 4. The three major stimulants--methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and pemoline--appear to be equally efficacious, although methylphenidate has emerged as the most commonly used and most studied drug. Because of its potential for causing liver toxicity, pemoline has remained a second-line medication. 5. The three major stimulants appear to have somewhat different mechanisms of action so that failure of a patient to respond to one medication does not mean that he or she will not respond to another. 6. The recommended starting doses for the stimulants are 0.3 mg per kg of methylphenidate, 0.15 mg per kg of dextroamphetamine, and 37.5 mg of pemoline. There is a great deal of individual variability in dose response, so doses must be titrated for optimal effects in each child. Sustained release preparations are much more expensive than regular preparations and may be less effective. 7. There is no evidence that stimulants have any effect on ultimate adult height. 8. Although relatively uncommon, motor tics have been observed in children on stimulants, and all children on stimulants need to be carefully monitored for the development of tics.

Several recent studies have demonstrated that variability in systemic exposure due to interpatient pharmacokinetic variability, may be related to the probability of oncolytic effects or toxicity for some anticancer drugs. This review has exemplified differences in the clinical pharmacology of several anticancer drugs, when children are compared to adults. Such age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs, together with biologic differences between pediatric and adult cancers, provide the rationale for systematically conducting pediatric phase I through IV studies of anticancer drugs and denote the risks of relying on adult trials to identify new therapeutic strategies for childhood cancers.\r"

In contrast, the pharmaco-dynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical indications, and toxicity of other diuretics used in the newborn require considerable further evaluation.

Duplicate cultures and duplicate rapid antigen tests were performed in two laboratories. The sensitivity and the specificity of the test were high, supporting the validity of this technique in diagnosing streptococcal pyoderma. Of importance, however, was the documentation of a learning curve effect on the sensitivity and specificity. There was a significant difference between the early samples and the later samples in one laboratory which had less previous experience with the rapid antigen detection test. By the time the later samples were collected, the proficiency of the first laboratory was equal to that of the second laboratory for both sensitivity and specificity. Although a learning curve effect on sensitivity and specificity of rapid antigen detection tests for Group A streptococci has been suspected, this is the first documentation of such an effect. This finding has important clinical implications for using rapid antigen detection tests for Group A streptococcal infections.\r"

Both for infants of 34 weeks or less and for very low birth weight (less than 1500 g) infants, periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage incidence decreased, respectively, from 34% and 39% in 1980 to 1981 to 19% and 25% in 1986 to 1987. This decrease was confined to true intraventricular hemorrhages, which decreased from 22% in 1980 to 1981 to 7% in 1986 to 1987 for infants of less than or equal to 34 weeks' gestation. These results were not influenced by a change in the distribution of birth weights or gestational ages of the infants evaluated nor by a change in the inborn to outborn ratio. The incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage was lower in infants born by cesarean section than those delivered vaginally, but the decrease could not be attributed to an increased number of deliveries by cesarean section. Although there were undoubtedly changes in neonatal care during this time period, no planned intervention occurred. It was concluded that pharmacologic intervention studies must be interpreted with caution.\r"

Cerebral blood flow velocity was evaluated in 24 preterm infants with symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus before and during the first 12 hours after a single intravenous dose of indomethacin, 0.1 mg/kg. Cerebral blood flow velocity was estimated by serial Doppler investigations of the anterior cerebral arteries. Indomethacin administration led to an instantaneous decrease of peak systolic flow velocity, temporal mean flow velocity, and end-diastolic flow velocity of the anterior cerebral arteries in all infants, which was maximal between 2 and 40 minutes after indomethacin administration and was followed by a more sustained recovery of all velocities to baseline values. Temporal mean flow velocity was not different from pre-indomethacin values at 3 hours after the administration. It is concluded that indomethacin can impact the cerebral circulation of the preterm infant for at least 2 hours. This may have consequences in preterm infants with unstable hemodynamics and pulmonary function.\r"

Clinical and nutritional outcomes were compared. The groups were similar at the start of the study. Four of 33 patients (12.1%) in the lactose group were considered to have treatment failure because of excessive purging with or without refusal to accept the diet, compared with 1 of 31 patients (3.2%) in the hydrolyzed lactose group (P = .20). Among successfully treated boys, fecal excretion was initially similar, but on days 3 to 5 of the trial the lactose group purged a mean 74.4 g/kg per day (95% confidence limits 17.8, 131.0) compared with 42.0 g/kg per day (95% confidence limits 11.4, 72.6) in the hydrolyzed lactose group (P less than .01). Diarrhea stopped within 30 hours of hospital admission in 11 children in the hydrolyzed lactose group (35.5%) compared with 1 child in the lactose group (3.3%) (P less than .001). Fecal excretion of carbohydrate, nitrogen, and energy was significantly greater in lactose group (P less than .01), but there were no significant differences in fat excretion or in incremental weight change during hospitalization. Feeding lactose-containing nonhuman milk as the sole nutrient source to children with persistent diarrhea resulted in substantially greater purging which was sufficiently severe to increase the risk of dehydration in these children.\r"

  ".W": "For certain forms of childhood epilepsy that remain uncontrolled despite adequate treatment with standard antiepileptic medication, surgical therapy should be considered as a potential avenue of treatment. The prognosis for seizure control after early surgery is generally favorable and is at least comparable with that of adults. Remissions are often long-standing or permanent. The results are particularly beneficial if a discrete region of abnormal epileptogenic tissue can be excised. The three major procedures--focal resection, corpus callosotomy, and hemispherectomy--have all been performed successfully in children, and their complication rates are low. With the exception of the obvious benefit conferred by alleviating seizures at a younger age, earlier surgery also improves later psychosocial status and adaptive function. By contrast, persistent seizure activity decreases the likelihood of achieving a functionally independent and economically productive adult life. The psychosocial benefits therefore constitute the most important argument in favor of early surgical intervention. Although relatively little is known about the neuropsychologic consequences of early surgery, there are few deleterious long-term cognitive or behavioral deficits if surgery is uncomplicated. However, relatively little is known about neural reorganization after early surgical excision or hemispheric disconnection, and this remains the greatest challenge for the future.\r"

The aspects of social support studied, as reflected in the measurement instruments designed by nurse researchers, appropriately emphasize available and enacted emotional and instrumental support from family (including spouse) and friends. However, informational and appraisal support, community sources of support, duration of support, mutual receipt and provision of support, costs associated with negative support, perceived and received support, and evaluation of satisfaction with support are infrequently assessed. Nurses need to evaluate which of these elements are merely desirable supplements and which, if any, are essential to validate the information elicited by instruments. Clearly, nurse investigators have operationalized important typologies in the social-psychological literature. However, the number of diverse measures could be considered superfluous.\r"

  ".W": "The introduction of a replication-inhibiting lesion into the DNA of Escherichia coli produces a marked elevation in mutation rate. The mutation pathway is a component of the induced, multigene SOS response. SOS mutagenesis is a tightly regulated process dependent on two RecA-mediated proteolytic events: cleavage of the LexA repressor to induce the UmuC and UmuD mutagenesis proteins, and cleavage of UmuD to UmuD' to activate the mutation pathway. To investigate the protein-protein interactions responsible for SOS mutagenesis, we have studied the interaction of UmuC, UmuD, and UmuD'. To probe intracellular interaction, we have used immunoprecipitation techniques with antibodies against UmuC or UmuD and UmuD'. We have found that antibody to UmuC precipitates UmuD' from cell extracts, and antibody to UmuD and UmuD' precipitates UmuC. Thus we conclude that UmuC probably associates tightly with UmuD' in cells. For biochemical studies, we have purified the UmuC and UmuD' proteins to use with the previously purified UmuD. UmuC associates strongly with an affinity column of UmuD and UmuD', eluting only under strongly dissociating conditions (2 M urea or 1.5 M KSCN). UmuC also associates efficiently with UmuD or UmuD' in solution, as judged by velocity sedimentation in a glycerol gradient. The likely stoichiometry is one UmuC with a dimeric UmuD or UmuD'. From these experiments and previous work, we infer that SOS mutagenesis depends on the action of the UmuC-UmuD' complex and probably RecA to rescue a stalled DNA polymerase III holoenzyme at the DNA lesion.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of the HRAS and KRAS proteins by human placental insulin receptor kinase. Purified HRAS proteins are not phosphorylated by purified insulin receptor kinase. Since the tyrosine phosphorylation of calmodulin by the insulin receptor kinase in vitro requires cofactors such as protamine and poly(L-lysine), we examined the possibility that poly(L-lysine) may also potentiate the interaction between RAS proteins and the insulin receptor. We found that purified HRAS proteins are indeed phosphorylated by purified insulin receptor kinase in the presence of poly(L-lysine). In contrast, the KRAS protein, which carries an extremely basic domain (residues 172-182, Lys-Asp-Glu-Lys6-Ser-Arg), is phosphorylated by the receptor kinase without the addition of basic proteins. We then determined whether the KRAS basic domain peptide plays a role similar to that of poly(L-lysine) and found that both the HRAS protein and calmodulin are phosphorylated by the receptor kinase in the presence of the KRAS basic domain peptide. Further examination of the role of poly(L-lysine) in potentiating tyrosine phosphorylation of the HRAS protein and calmodulin by purified insulin receptor kinase indicates that poly(L-lysine) affects the conformation of these protein substrates as well as that of the receptor kinase domain. These studies suggest that polylysine-like basic proteins or domains are required to establish the interaction between insulin receptor kinase and its substrate.\r"

The bifunctional enzyme (470 residues per subunit) was efficiently expressed as a protein that starts with the initiator methionine residue and ends at the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue. The expressed protein was purified to homogeneity by anion exchange and Blue Sepharose chromatography and had kinetic and physical properties similar to the purified rat liver enzyme, including its behavior as a dimer during gel filtration, activation of the kinase by phosphate and inhibition by alpha-glycerol phosphate, and mediation of the bisphosphatase reaction by a phosphoenzyme intermediate. The expressed 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase also started with the initiator methionine but ended at residue 257. The partially purified kinase domain was catalytically active, had reduced affinities for ATP and fructose 6-phosphate compared with the kinase of the bifunctional enzyme, and had no fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase activity. The kinase domain also behaved as an oligomeric protein during gel filtration. The expression of an active kinase domain and the previous demonstration of an actively expressed bisphosphatase domain provide strong support for the hypothesis that the hepatic enzyme consists of two independent catalytic domains encoded by a fused gene.\r"

We have examined the DNA-protein interactions within the first intron of the c-myb gene and identified a 1.0-kilobase region that could be responsible for its transcriptional regulation. Using the mobility-shift assay, we show a direct correlation between the extent of sequence-specific protein binding to intron 1 DNA fragments, and c-myb mRNA levels in different cell types. During dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of mouse erythroleukemic cells, there was a dramatic decrease in these nuclear factors that correlated with the decrease in the levels of c-myb mRNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis and DNase I footprinting revealed the presence of putative regulatory elements that are implicated in the binding of these nuclear factors. We propose that binding of nuclear factors to the site of transcriptional pause could play an important role in the regulation of c-myb transcription.\r"

To do so we directed synthesis of NIFA in a coupled transcription-translation system and detected its ability to activate expression of a translational fusion between the nifH and lacZ genes. We infer that NIFA stimulates initiation of transcription by sigma 54 holoenzyme from the nifHDK promoter. The activity of NIFA was lost rapidly under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 30 degrees C and was lost somewhat less rapidly at 0 degrees C. Loss of activity was not accompanied by degradation of NIFA polypeptide. Loss of activity was approximately exponential and was not affected by NIFA concentration over a 5-fold range. Therefore, NIFA inactivation does not appear to be due to self-association. We found that the factor in crude extracts previously demonstrated to bind to the nifHDK promoter-regulatory region [Beynon, J., Cannon, M., Buchanan-Wollaston, V., and Cannon, F. (1983) Cell 34, 665-671] is the integration host factor, which is known to bend DNA. Since the binding site for integration host factor lies between the upstream binding site for NIFA and the nifHDK promoter, integration host factor may bend the DNA between these two sites to facilitate productive interactions between NIFA and sigma 54 holoenzyme.\r"

These enzymes, the products of the ALG1, ALG7, and DPM1 genes, catalyze the transfer of sugars from nucleotide sugars to dolichol phosphate derivatives. The consensus sequence for the conserved peptide was Leu-Phe-Val-Xaa-Phe-Xaa-Xaa-Ile-Pro-Phe-Xaa-Phe-Tyr. A sequence resembling the conserved peptide was also found in the predicted SEC59 protein, which is suspected to participate in assembly of the lipid-linked precursor oligosaccharide, although its specific function is unknown. All of the identified sequences contain an isoleucine at position 8 and phenylalanine or tyrosine at positions 2, 5, and 12. We believe this peptide may be involved in dolichol recognition for the following reasons. (i) The conserved sequence occurs in potential membrane-spanning regions. (ii) The ALG7 and DPM1 proteins are known to recognize the isoprenoid region of dolichol phosphate specifically; this recognition presumably occurs in the membrane since dolichol is very hydrophobic. (iii) The consensus sequence is similar to a region of two halobacterial proteins implicated in binding of the isoprenoid region of retinal. (iv) If the consensus sequence is represented as an alpha-helix, the conserved residues lie on one face of the helix. An alpha-helical structure is likely since the conserved regions are in potential membrane-spanning domains.\r"

Exchange of CAP subunits is accelerated at least 1000-fold by the presence of nonspecific DNA, under low ionic strength conditions. Catalysis of exchange also occurs at physiological ionic conditions. In contrast, physiological concentrations of cAMP stabilize CAP with respect to subunit exchange in either the presence or the absence of DNA. We discuss the functional implications of monomerization of gene-regulatory proteins resulting from kinetic and thermodynamic lability of their dimers.\r"

Using run-on transcription experiments in isolated nuclei, we have shown that some of this response is from enhanced transcription of the GM-CSF gene. Changes in the transcription rate of this gene can be seen as early as 30 min after adding the Con A. With a DNA fragment mobility-shift assay on nuclear extracts from these cells we detected a protein that binds upstream of the murine GM-CSF gene. Partial purification and concentration of this protein by DEAE-Sephacel and phosphocellulose chromatography enabled us to examine its interaction with DNA in more detail. Competition and methylation interference experiments have shown that the protein binds to the sequence 3'-TCCATCAAGGGG-5' (positions -90 to -82).

Although the Tat sequence contains arginine- and cysteine-rich stretches that are difficult to synthesize, it was possible to prepare pure peptides in good yield by using fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. A peptide containing residues 1-58 had 5-10% the activity of full-length Tat. Deleting 4 amino acids from the N terminus of this peptide further reduced activity, while peptides with more extensive N-terminal deletions and peptides missing the basic region at the C terminus had no detectable activity. A peptide previously reported to transactivate, Tat-(37-62), was completely inactive in our assays. Inactive peptides were also tested as possible inhibitors of transactivation. Tat-(21-38), which contains the cysteine-rich region and can form heterodimers with intact Tat in vitro, showed inhibition at high peptide concentrations. However, this effect was not specific for Tat or for the HIV promoter, since the peptide also inhibited expression from the simian virus 40 early promoter.\r"

The positive cell lines contained a 1.8-kilobase PD-ECGF mRNA, and a 45-kDa protein could be demonstrated in lysates of the cell lines by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation using a specific antiserum against PD-ECGF. Furthermore, the cell lysates contained mitogenic activity for endothelial cells that was neutralized by the PD-ECGF antiserum. PD-ECGF was found to be secreted only slowly from the producer cells, consistent with the previous finding that the primary translation product lacks a signal sequence. The restricted expression and intracellular sequestration of PD-ECGF imply a strictly controlled function in endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Aberrant production of PD-ECGF may play a role in tumor angiogenesis.\r"

We developed universally applicable approaches to establish authenticity, localize and orient internal genes, map restriction sites, and rescue the distal ends of large human genomic DNA inserts. We selected human chromosome segment 18q21.3 as a model system. Molecular cloning of this segment was initiated by characterizing three plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2) clones [290, 180, and 60 kilobases (kb)] isolated from a YAC library. Comparison of YAC and bacteriophage lambda genomic DNA clones confirmed the fidelity of the PAI-2 locus. Detailed rare cutting restriction maps were generated by ramped contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis. The PAI-2 locus was located and oriented within the YACs, which span a distance 70 kb 5' to 220 kb 3' of PAI-2. Moreover, both left and right ends of the YAC genomic DNA inserts were rescued by amplifying circularized cloning sites with an inverted form of the polymerase chain reaction. These unique terminal genomic DNA fragments were used to rescreen the YAC library and isolate overlapping clones that extend the map. These approaches will enable neighboring loci to be definitively linked and establish the feasibility of using YAC technology to clone and map chromosomal segments.\r"

  ".U": "90017508\r", 
  ".W": "The SUI2 and SUI3 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encode the alpha and beta subunits, respectively, of translation initiation factor eIF-2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2). Previously isolated mutations in these genes restore expression from his4 mutant alleles lacking an ATG initiation codon. The SUI mutations also lead to increased levels of HIS4 mRNA. We show that the latter phenotype exists because the SUI mutations elevate expression of GCN4, an activator of HIS4 transcription. Increased GCN4 expression in the SUI mutants occurs independently of the GCN2 and GCN3 gene products that are normally required to stimulate translation of GCN4 mRNA under conditions of amino acid starvation. Derepression of GCN4 expression in the SUI mutants requires the multiple AUG codons in the leader of the GCN4 transcript that normally mediate its translational control by amino acid availability. In these respects, the SUI mutations resemble mutations in GCD genes whose products function as translational repressors of GCN4. Thus, in addition to its general role in AUG start codon selection, eIF-2 appears to be an important factor in GCN4 translational control. We also show that deletion of GCN3 in sui2-1 strains is lethal, suggesting that GCN3 contributes to eIF-2 alpha function in addition to its role as a translational activator of GCN4.\r"

The 115-amino acid polypeptide encoded by the MIF cDNA (p7-1) was effectively released from the transfected COS-1 cells and yielded readily detectable MIF activity in the culture supernatant despite the apparent lack of a classical protein secretory sequence. Insertional mutational analysis and elution of MIF activity from polyacrylamide gel slices demonstrated that the Mr 12,000 protein with MIF activity released by the COS-1 cells is encoded by p7-1. The p7-1 cDNA hybridized with a 700-base mRNA expressed by Con-A-stimulated lymphocytes but not unstimulated lymphocytes. The availability of the MIF cDNA clone and recombinant MIF will facilitate the analysis of the role of this lymphokine in cell-mediated immunity, immunoregulation, and inflammation.\r"

To study the differentiative capacity of T-cell precursors, we isolated CD4-, CD8-, surface(s) CD3- thymocytes from postnatal human thymuses and determined their capacity to differentiate into lymphoid and nonlymphoid lineages in vitro. We found that CD4-, CD8-, sCD3- thymocytes, which differentiated in the presence of T-cell conditioned medium plus interleukin 2 into T cells expressing the gamma delta receptor for antigen, were capable of differentiating into myeloid or erythroid lineages in the presence of either 5637 bladder carcinoma cell line conditioned medium plus recombinant human erythropoietin or human thymic epithelial cell conditioned medium. Thymic epithelial cell conditioned medium was as effective as 5637 supernatant plus erythropoietin in inducing myeloerythroid differentiation in the CD4-, CD8-, sCD3- thymocytes. Sixty-eight +/- 14% of CD4-, CD8-, sCD3- thymocytes underwent nonlymphoid differentiation within 4 days in culture with 5637 supernatant plus erythropoietin. Twenty-six +/- 4% of freshly isolated CD4-, CD8-, sCD3- cells were CD34+, and clonal granulocyte/macrophage, granulocyte/erythrocyte/monocyte/megakaryocyte, and T-cell progenitors were found in both CD34+ and CD34- subsets of CD4-, CD8-, sCD3- thymocytes. Thus, cells within the human CD4-, CD8-, sCD3- thymocyte subset can give rise to gamma delta+ T cells as well as to cells of myeloerythroid lineages. Moreover, CD34+, CD4-, CD8-, sCD3- cells can give rise to clonal T-cell progenitors as well as to clonal myeloid progenitors.\r"

  ".W": "Two human neuroblastoma cell lines were persistently infected with poliovirus strains of all three serotypes. In persistently infected IMR-32 cells, which were studied in greatest detail, viral antigens were present in most cells, and over a 9-month period virions were found in the medium at high titers. Persistently infected cells were resistant to superinfection by Sabin 1, 2, and 3 poliovirus but sensitive to coxsackievirus B3. The viruses recovered from persistently infected cells were studied for conservation of epitopes, host cell specificity, and temperature resistance phenotype. The antigenic site 1 carried by the major capsid protein VP1 was modified on the persistent viruses of all three serotypes. This was confirmed for one virus by sequencing the corresponding genomic region in which two mutations were detected. The titers of persistent viruses were 1-3 log10 units higher on IMR-32 cells than on nonneuronal HEp-2 cells, while parental viruses had similar titers on both lines. When thermosensitive viruses were used to initiate the infection, the persistent viruses were found to be thermoresistant at 39 degrees C. Together the results indicate that the persistent infection correlated with the selection of highly mutated viral strains. Poliovirus-infected neuroblastoma cell lines thus constitute an in vitro model of chronic viral infections, which are increasingly implicated in human neural diseases.\r"

The virus is tropic for a human red cell progenitor cell, and failure to culture B19 in a cell line has limited its clinical study. We cotransfected the right half of the cloned B19 genome and a minigene derived from the human dihydrofolate reductase gene (DHFR) into dhfr--Chinese hamster ovary cells and screened selected clones by RNA analysis; after amplification in methotrexate, clones were tested for capsid protein expression. A cell line, designated 3-11-5, stably expressed nearly full-length transcripts for the two capsid proteins. These cells produced the major and minor structural protein species in natural proportions that self-assembled into virion capsids. Capsids from 3-11-5 cells could be separated from virions by sucrose gradient sedimentation and had the density on cesium chloride isopycnic sedimentation of empty parvovirus capsids. Capsid protein was present in both nuclei and cytoplasm on immunofluorescence study but fractionated with the cytosol on purification. Empty capsid production was equal to or greater than virion production by infected bone-marrow cells, 1000-2000 capsids per cell, but cell growth was not diminished by capsid production. This cell line will be useful in developing practical assays for B19 parvovirus antibody and a vaccine for the virus, as well as potentially serving as a packaging cell line for gene therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 1, an immune response-generated cytokine that stimulates astrocyte proliferation and reactivity (astrogliosis), was present in up to 30 times as many glial cells in tissue sections of brain from patients with Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease compared with age-matched control subjects. Most interleukin 1-immunoreactive glia in Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease were classified as microglia. The number of interleukin 1 immunoreactive neurons did not appear to differ in Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease compared with control brain. Numerous temporal lobe astrocytes in Alzheimer disease and postnatal Down syndrome were intensely interleukin 1-, S-100-, and glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive and had reactive structure. Interleukin 1 levels in Alzheimer disease temporal lobe homogenates were elevated, as were the levels of S-100 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, two proteins reportedly elevated in reactive astrocytes. These data suggest that increased expression of S-100 in Down syndrome, resulting from duplication of the gene on chromosome 21 that encodes the beta subunit of S-100, may be augmented by elevation of interleukin 1. As a corollary, the astrogliosis in Alzheimer disease may be promoted by elevation of interleukin 1.\r"

Tissue sections of spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia were hybridized with an 35S-radiolabeled endothelin 1 complementary RNA probe. Autoradiograms showed labeled neurons in the spinal cord (laminae IV-VI and many motoneurons) and numerous small and large neurons in the dorsal root ganglia. Endothelin 1 transcripts were also found in association with the endothelial layer of some blood vessels in the white matter of the spinal cord. A similar distribution of immunoreactivity was seen using three antisera to endothelin 1, but fewer cells were immunostained than were labeled after the hybridization. Two other endothelin 1 antisera immunostained the endothelial lining of blood vessels in the spinal cord white matter but not neurons. In the ganglia, endothelin 1 transcripts were localized to all cells expressing beta-preprotachykinin and most expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide mRNAs; in the majority of the motoneurons, coexistence of endothelin 1 and calcitonin gene-related peptide mRNAs was noted. There was a similar pattern of coexistence for respective peptide immunoreactivities in the ganglia and spinal cord. The expression of endothelin 1 mRNA in distinct neuronal cell types suggests that this peptide plays a part in neural transmission/modulation and adds a further dimension to the known vascular-related actions of endothelin 1.\r"

The channel or a closely related molecule is present in the membrane whether or not the pathway is open, since, in addition to inhibiting the conductance of the open channel, the antibody also bound to the membrane in the resting state and prevented subsequent opening of the channel. The antibody was shown to recognize, by ELISA, epitopes from the Necturus gallbladder and small intestine. Finally, by Western blot analysis of Necturus gallbladder homogenates, the antibody was shown to recognize two protein bands of Mr 219,000 and Mr 69,000. This antibody should permit isolation and characterization of this important ion channel.\r"

It is a disease that should be treated because of the anxiety and disfigurement it causes in the affected patient. Acne therapy is directed against the three probable pathogenic processes in acne: (1) abnormal keratinization of the sebaceous follicle, (2) excessive production of sebum, and (3) proliferation of bacteria in the follicle. Superficial acne consisting of comedones and small papulopustules will frequently respond to topical therapy such as retinoic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and topical antibiotics. Deeper lesions require systemic antibiotics of which tetracycline is the drug of choice. Severe, recalcitrant cystic acne usually responds well to the oral retinoid, isotretinoin. The severe teratogenic effects of isotretinoin on a developing fetus make this a risky drug to prescribe for women with childbearing potential. In such cases the greatest precautions should be taken to avoid pregnancy during a course of isotretinoin. Such precautions include pregnancy testing, contraceptive counseling, and the use of at least two effective forms of birth control in sexually active women.\r"

The drug exanthem, urticaria, and contact dermatitis are the most common adverse cutaneous reactions to medications. Drug exanthems occur in 2 to 3 per cent of medical inpatients and are most commonly caused by antibiotics and blood products. The incidence of drug exanthems is much higher in certain patient populations (for example, patients with AIDS treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Urticaria is the second most common allergic cutaneous reaction to drugs. Individual urticarial lesions last for less than 24 hours and do not leave hyperpigmentation or scarring. Urticaria not accompanied by systemic symptoms should not be treated with systemic corticosteroids or parenteral epinephrine. Allergic contact dermatitis is commonly caused by neomycin, benzocaine, ethylenediamine, diphenhydramine, and transdermal patches. The clinical spectrum of other, less common drug eruptions is wide. Toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and fixed drug eruptions share similar pathologic features, are caused by many of the same drugs, and may have a similar pathogenesis. Photoallergic drug reactions require the interaction of drugs, UV irradiation, and the immune system. Drugs implicated in causing photoallergy include thiazide diuretics, sulfonamides, and phenothiazines. Eruptions seen in serum sickness include the drug exanthem, urticaria, vasculitis, urticarial vasculitis, and erythema multiforme. Identifying and discontinuing the responsible drug is usually essential for successful therapy of drug eruptions.\r"

On the one hand, dermatologic problems are so common in childhood that the primary care physician is forced to become involved with many of them; on the other hand, the scope of dermatologic conditions found in children is so broad as to be beyond the skills of most primary care physicians. The secret to managing dermatologic problems in children within a primary care setting is to recognize that a relatively small group of conditions encompass the vast majority of reasons for which a primary care physician will be consulted. By recognizing those conditions and becoming expert in the treatment of those well-defined areas, the primary care physician can perform a true service. Critical to this approach, however, is to establish clear limits and to practice within the framework of one's competence. Recognizing the importance of early referral of those cases that fall outside one's expertise is an important measure of the primary care physician's competence as seen by patients and their families. This article attempts to assist primary care physicians in developing their own set of guidelines.\r"

Definitively benign masses (those localized to the skin, of fat density, or of mixed density) will not require more attention. Among the remaining water-density lesions, those that have an even slightly stellate appearance should be considered suspicious for malignancy; virtually all of them will undergo biopsy. Well-circumscribed masses should next be evaluated by aspiration or US examination to establish or exclude the diagnosis of simple benign cyst. Only solid and indeterminate lesions will require further evaluation, with the ultimate decision for biopsy versus mammographic follow-up depending on the probability of malignancy determined by the combination of mammographic and physical findings as well as pertinent data from the medical history.\r"

At the 3.50-3.75-MHz nominal frequencies used in the study, images of the human abdomen showed little discernible change in quality with varying exposure levels. However, phantom tests confirmed that depth of penetration is a function of exposure level. The results suggest that a judicious use of exposure level and receiver gain controls can be a practical means for minimizing patient exposure to ultrasound without sacrifice of diagnostic effectiveness.\r"

Seventy-five patients underwent both sonography and arthrography. Compared with arthrography alone, ultrasound examinations enabled detection of 92% of rotator cuff tears (24 of 26 tears), with a specificity of 84% and a negative predictive value of 95%. Correlation was obtained in 30 of these patients who underwent surgery for rotator cuff tear or other soft-tissue abnormality. In this group, the sensitivity of sonography for detection of a tear was 93%, with a specificity of 73%, while for arthrography sensitivity was 87% and specificity was 100%. These data indicate that sonography is a useful, noninvasive screening procedure for patients suspected of having rotator cuff injury.\r"

About one-half of biopsy and imaging results agreed completely. In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, false-negative findings were frequent with both imaging techniques. Although a positive biopsy result is usually accepted as proof of bone marrow infiltration, results indicate that negative biopsy findings do not exclude tumor involvement. When suspected infiltration was found with MR imaging or scintigraphy but results were normal or suggestive of reactive changes in the first blind biopsy, repeat blind or guided biopsy helped confirm the imaging results. Autopsy findings in two patients completely confirmed previous results with MR imaging and scintigraphy, although findings at antemortem biopsy were different. Scintigraphy and MR imaging should be included routinely in the staging of malignant lymphoma as an adjunct to blind biopsy in the complete evaluation of bone marrow status.\r"

The present study was undertaken to determine whether the two methods provide the same or different information relating to gallbladder emptying. Emptying was simultaneously studied with both methods during infusion of graded physiologic doses of cholecystokinin (CCK) in six healthy subjects. Infusion of stepwise increasing doses of CCK, ranging from 0.03 to 0.5 Ivy dog units per kilogram of body weight per hour (IDU/kg.h), induced significant dose-related increases in plasma CCK, decreases in gallbladder volume assessed with US, and gallbladder emptying assessed with cholescintigraphy. The threshold dose for inducing significant gallbladder emptying was 0.13 IDU/kg.h, as determined with both techniques, indicating similar detection limits. There was a highly significant correlation between decreases in gallbladder volume and decreases in radioactive counts over the gallbladder region, with a tendency toward greater gallbladder responses at sonography during the early phase of gallbladder contraction and toward greater responses at cholescintigraphy during the later phase of gallbladder contraction. It is concluded that these methods can be used interchangeably for the quantitation of gallbladder emptying.\r"

Stenosis was a limiting factor for accurate staging (16% of cases). ES was reasonably accurate in assessment of lymph node metastasis: Overall accuracy was 82% for the esophagus and 66% for the stomach. For nonmetastatic lymph nodes, however, the accuracy was low (56% or less for both esophagus and stomach). Difficulties occurred in distinguishing inflammation from micrometastatic lymph node involvement. ES was not accurate for diagnosis of distant metastases due to limited penetration of ultrasound. Prevalence of lymph node metastasis increased with the progression of tumor infiltration. Technical improvements, such as a smaller diameter echoprobe, may further enhance diagnostic accuracy of ES.\r"

Diagnoses in the patients included gout in seven; Sjogren syndrome in two; medullary sponge kidney in two; primary aldosteronism in two; and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, hyperparathyroidism, glycogen storage disease type XI, Wilson disease, and pseudo-Bartter syndrome in one each. The pathogenesis of the echogenicity was evaluated by comparing the findings from computed tomography and conventional radiography. It appears that a hyperechoic medulla is caused by hyperuricemia, medullary nephrocalcinosis, or hypokalemia. US is considered to be useful in evaluating renal involvement in patients with these diseases.\r"

Venography disclosed deep vein thrombosis in 31 patients. With the whole limb considered an anatomic entity, antifibrin antibody scintigrams obtained 2 hours after injection had a specificity and sensitivity of 81% and 84%, respectively. A higher sensitivity (92%) was found for a subgroup of patients (n = 44) with symptoms for less than 10 days. Regional sensitivities for all patients and for the subgroup, respectively, were 92% and 100% in the calf, 82% and 94% in the popliteal region, 63% and 71% in the thigh, and only 18% and 13% in the pelvis. Additional imaging performed 6 hours and 21 hours after injection in 12 patients and quantitative analysis done from scintigrams with and without blood-pool (technetium-99m human serum albumin) correction did not improve sensitivity. In-111-antifibrin antibody scintigraphy is an accurate method for diagnosis of acute established deep vein thrombosis of the calf and popliteal region; its sensitivity in the thigh is lower, and it is not feasible for diagnosis in the pelvic area.\r"

Six women and five men, aged 31-75 years, underwent percutaneous endoscopic cholecystolithotripsy between April 1988 and October 1988. The gallbladder was punctured by means of an anterior transperitoneal approach. The tract was dilated, and gallstones were removed with a modified 21-F cholecystoscope under direct visual inspection. Calculi too large for extraction were disintegrated with ultrasound or electrohydraulic lithotripsy. Eight patients were stone-free and two had small residual stones 3 months later; nine were stone-free 6 months after the procedure. Although more invasive than shock-wave lithotripsy, percutaneous endoscopic cholecystolithotripsy has the advantage of immediate removal of more calculi, causes less pain, necessitates less postoperative immobilization, and allows patients to leave the hospital sooner.\r"

Only minor complications related to percutaneous cholecystostomy placement occurred in this series: catheter dislodgment without sequelae (n = 2) and significant abdominal pain (n = 2). Technical problems included guide-wire buckling during catheter insertion (n = 1) and failed attempted cholecystostomy (n = 1).

Subjects with any previous thyroid disease were excluded. Thyroid nodules or abnormalities of the echo structure were found in 36 (35.6%) subjects. Seventeen (47.2%) subjects had solitary nodules, 14 (38.9%) had multiple nodules, and five (13.9%) had diffuse abnormalities. Subjects with abnormal findings at US were further examined with fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Clinical examination and blood tests were performed for evaluation of levels of thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and thyroid antibodies. One patient had a leukemic thyroid nodule, but no primary thyroid malignancies were found. In most cases, cytologic findings were benign and nonspecific, with a variable amount of degenerative changes. Three atoxic multinodular goiters and two cases of Hashimoto thyroiditis were detected. The results are in accordance with autopsy studies indicating that focal nodular changes of the thyroid gland are common in middle-aged women.\r"

Arterial structures consistently identified included the ophthalmic artery, central retinal artery, and posterior ciliary branches. The terminal lacrimal branch was seen in the majority of orbits (n = 19). Venous structures consistently seen included the central retinal vein and venae vorticosae; the superior ophthalmic vein was identified in the majority of normal orbits (n = 22). Response of the superior ophthalmic vein to the Valsalva maneuver was assessed in six of the normal subjects (12 orbits). Retrograde flow was typically seen during the maneuver and accentuated antegrade flow after cessation of the maneuver. Pathologic entities correctly diagnosed with CDFI included a dural arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with spontaneous carotid-cavernous fistula, an orbital AVM, and superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis. Vascular lesions were excluded in two patients with orbital masses. Bilaterally enlarged superior ophthalmic veins were identified in a patient with unilateral symptoms suggestive of a varix; CDFI results were confirmed with computed tomography, but orbital venograms were interpreted as normal. These findings suggest that CDFI may be helpful in the evaluation of suspected vascular orbital disease.\r"

Follow-up ranged from 3 to 39 months, with five patients dying before 6 months follow-up. At 1 month follow-up, 49 (52%) of 95 lesions showed complete response; 28 (29%), partial response; and 18 (19%), no change. At 6 or more months follow-up, 54 (67%) of 81 lesions demonstrated local control; 10 (12%), partial response; six (7%), no change; and 11 (14%), local-regional recurrences. Superficial blisters occurred in 24 (25%) of 95 lesions, whereas long-term complications (deep necrosis, subcutaneous burns) occurred in seven (7%) lesions. Relapse occurred in 16 (17%) lesions, seven after initial complete response and nine after partial response. Several prognostic treatment factors were identified: applied radiation dose (greater than 30 Gy, P less than .01), size of tumor (less than 6 cm diameter, P less than .001), minimum tumor temperature (greater than 41 degrees C, P less than .001), and status of disease (M0 or M1 vs M2, P less than .001). Treatment complications were correlated with maximum temperatures (greater than 45 degrees C, P less than .001). In summary the palliative treatment concept proved to be safe and effective.\r"

The existence of these domains in Escherichia coli was investigated by the ability of different lengths of (CG) tracts, cloned upstream or downstream from the tetracycline resistance gene (tet) of pBR322, to adopt the Z structure in vivo. Segments as short as 12 base pairs adopt the Z form when cloned upstream from the tet gene (Eco RI site), whereas no Z DNA was detected when this sequence was cloned downstream (Sty I site), even with a 74-base pair (CG) tract that requires less supercoiling than shorter tracts for the B-Z transition. Hence the localized supercoil density in pBR322 can be as high as -0.038 and as low as -0.021 at different loci. These data demonstrate the existence of the Z structure for commonly found natural sequences and support the notion of domains of negative supercoiling in vivo.\r"

On CT, metastases to the ovary were large lobulated or oval masses with cystic and solid components. Nine were bilateral and three were unilateral. Three patterns of ovarian enlargement were seen: macrocystic (six), microcystic (three), and predominantly solid enlargement with necrosis (three). Other associated CT findings included carcinomatosis, hydronephrosis, ascites, liver metastases, and lymphadenopathy.

In one study group, 40 women received metoclopramide (15 mg); in the other group, 41 women received droperidol (0.5 mg). Twelve women (30%) in the metoclopramide group, versus eight (20%) in the droperidol group, had intraoperative, postdelivery nausea (P = NS). One woman (3%) in the metoclopramide group, versus two women (5%) in the droperidol group, had intraoperative, postdelivery vomiting (P = NS). During the first four postoperative hours, five women (12%) in each group complained of nausea. Three women (7%) in each group had postoperative vomiting.

A review of epidemiologic data from the 19th and 20th centuries reveals that acceptable statistical studies have yet to be carried out, but suggests that the disease has always been of extremely low incidence. Further, there does not appear to be a markedly decreased incidence in the \"modern era.\" The etiology of the disease remains elusive, although the pathogenesis appears to be due to delayed hypersensitivity (cell-mediated immunity), possibly directed at a surface membrane antigen that is shared by photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium and choroidal melanocytes. The only effective therapy remains preventive enucleation of the injured eye, despite modern usage of immunosuppressive agents. Studies have suggested that early enucleation of a blind exciting eye can improve the prognosis for the sympathizing eye.\r"

Careful longterm follow-up of disposable soft lens patients will be needed to establish actual patient compliance and the safety of these lenses.\r"

For 153 of 453 consecutive carotid reconstructions, the durability of the internal jugular vein (n = 76) and the greater saphenous vein (n = 77) as a patch angioplasty was compared. Mean postoperative follow-up was 17 months (1 to 52 months). The vein-patched carotid-bifurcation was studied by means of duplex ultrasonography to assess patency, detect restenosis, and measure cross-sectional diameter during systole. No carotid bifurcation occluded after operation. No ruptures or aneurysmal dilatations of the vein patches were observed. The maximum diameter (mean +/- SD) of the carotid patch angioplasties constructed with internal jugular vein (9.4 +/- 1.9 mm) was similar to patches made with greater saphenous vein (9.6 +/- 1.7 mm). In 95 patients serial duplex examinations demonstrated maximum diameter changes of the vein-patched internal carotid artery ranging from an increase of 3.5 mm to a decrease of 3.0 mm. Asymptomatic restenosis (greater than 50% diameter reduction) was detected in 2/95 (2.1%) patients. Because of the premium placed on the saphenous vein for peripheral arterial reconstruction and coronary artery bypass grafting, the ipsilateral internal jugular vein should be used more frequently for carotid patch angioplasty.\r"

We report the first prospective, blinded study to compare the efficacy of four imaging modalities in 100 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). Patients were examined by computer-assisted thallium 201/technetium 99m subtraction scintigraphy (TTS), computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US), and magnetic resonance (MR). Each study was performed and interpreted independently. Subsequent neck exploration and \"curative\" parathyroidectomy allowed correlation of surgical findings with imaging reports to score their accuracy. Overall sensitivities of the four imaging modalities were TTS, 73%, CT, 68%, US, 55%; and MR, 57%; with respective specificities of 94%, 92%, 95%, and 87%. Sensitivities for lesions located below the thyroid gland (thymic tongue and mediastinum) were TTS, 90%; CT, 46%; US, 44%; and MR, 50%; with respective specificities of 100%, 99%, 100%, and 94%. There was a significant increase in overall sensitivity when TTS and CT (90%, p less than 0.01) or TTS and US (85%, p less than 0.05) were used together; however, the combination of any three or even four imaging modalities did not increase sensitivity further. For small parathyroid tumors (less than or equal to 250 mg), no imaging technique had a sensitivity of more than 50%. None of the imaging studies accurately localized small hyperplastic parathyroid glands found in patients with multiple gland disease. Preoperative parathyroid imaging may not be indicated in pHPT patients undergoing first-time neck exploration because surgeons experienced in parathyroid surgery have a 93% to 96% cure rate.\r"

Silicone gel sheeting was applied to 14 hypertrophic scars in 10 adults for 8 weeks. The treated scars and untreated, mirror-image or adjacent control scars were photographed, biopsy specimens were taken, and they were measured elastometrically before and after treatment. Photography and elastometry were repeated 4 weeks after treatment was discontinued. All the scars that had been treated for at least 12 hours a day were improved clinically after 4 weeks. There was further clinical improvement during the second 4 weeks of treatment. Elastometrically, the treated scars were improved significantly at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, compared with both their own treatment value and the control scars (p less than 0.05). Control scars were unchanged elastometrically. Clinical improvement persisted for at least 4 weeks after treatment was discontinued. The silicone gel sheeting was well tolerated, except for occasional transient rashes or superficial maceration--both of which resolved promptly when treatment was withdrawn. There was no histologic evidence of inflammation or foreign body reaction suggesting that silicone had entered the treated tissues. We conclude that this simple method of treating hypertrophic scar is efficacious, even in relatively chronic cases. The mechanism of action of silicone gel, which is apparently not related to compression, remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Transmission-emission scanning of the thorax with a flood source of technetium-99m (99mTc), autologous 99mTc labelled red blood cells, and diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (99mTc DTPA) allows measurement of thoracic tissue thickness and blood and interstitial volume per pixel of the gamma camera image. Volume of blood or interstitium per pixel divided by pixel area gives the thoracic tissue thickness for these two compartments. A measure of lung tissue thickness may be obtained by subtracting chest wall thickness as measured on a lateral chest radiograph. As part of the evaluation of this technique 13 patients were scanned before treatment for proved or presumed pneumocystis pneumonia and their results were compared with those of 12 normal young men, approximately matched for age. In the patients with pneumocystis pneumonia lung tissue thickness at the base of the right lung averaged 3.4 cm (71%) more than that in the normal subjects, and interstitial thickness was 1.2 cm (150%) more than in the normal subjects. After treatment 10 of the patients with pneumocystis pneumonia were scanned again. Lung tissue thickness remained greater than the control value by 1.2 cm and interstitial tissue thickness by 0.5 cm. Blood thickness remained unchanged. Lung tissue and interstitial tissue thickness was correlated with a numerical score of the changes in the chest radiograph. The changes in the properties of the lung tissue compartments in the patients presumably reflect the mural and intra-alveolar inflammation found in pneumocystis pneumonia. Transmission scanning alone measures the increase of lung tissue thickness as well as transmission-emission scanning. It may be of value in monitoring the progress of this condition during treatment.\r"

During a run in period of two to four weeks corticosteroid treatment was reduced when possible to produce a comparable level of symptoms across the trial population. The test treatment was then taken for four weeks, with the severity of asthma recorded daily by patients and assessed at two weekly hospital visits. There was an improvement in symptoms in the patients taking nedocromil sodium by comparison with those having the placebo, the differences being significant for diary card PEF readings, asthma symptom scores, and bronchodilator usage at night. The mean difference between the two groups was 18 l/min for PEF, 0.42 for daytime asthma score, and 1.73 puffs in 24 hours for bronchodilator usage. These results suggest that asthmatic patients who require inhaled steroids show better control of their asthma with the addition of nedocromil sodium than of placebo over a four week period after reduction of the dosage of their inhaled steroids.\r"

B lymphocytes were observed in biopsy specimens from only two out of nine patients. CD8+ T cells outnumbered CD4+ cells in all patients in a ratio ranging from 2:1 to 10:1. Most T lymphocytes also strongly expressed CD7 antigen and a proportion of them expressed HLA-DR. Most of the lymphocytic infiltration occurred just beneath the basement membrane of the epithelium, though intraepithelial and submucosal infiltration was also seen. Non-lymphoid mononuclear cells expressing the phenotype of dendritic cells and macrophages were found dispersed throughout the infiltrate, most of them expressing HLA-DR. These observations support the hypothesis that cell mediated immunological reactions contribute to the inflammation associated with bronchiectasis.\r"

There was a relation between ipsilateral hemispheric stroke/TIA and severe carotid disease (p less than 0.001). Four of seven men with total occlusion had a stroke or a clinically confirmed TIA. Nevertheless, the majority of carotid stenoses (including severe stenoses) were asymptomatic. Cerebrovascular symptoms were not significantly more frequent among the men having moderate stenosis than among those having healthy arteries.\r"

For the diagnosis of more severe lesions, additional information was obtained from disturbances in the Doppler audio spectrum. Biplane arteriography was used as a reference. The observed agreement, sensitivity, and specificity were 86.6%, 90.3%, and 88.6%, respectively, for all lesions and 85.7%, 82.1%, and 88.6%, respectively, when only minor lesions were considered. kappa (a chance-corrected measure of agreement) was 81.7%. If only blood flow abnormalities were used to detect minor lesions, 43.5% would be missed. Our results indicate that minor carotid artery lesions can be diagnosed noninvasively more accurately when both local blood flow irregularities and local changes in vessel wall distensibility are taken into account.\r"

  ".W": "In the past thirty years, the mortality rate from prostate cancer has not declined. This is due in part to the small number of tumors diagnosed while they are still curable by surgery or radiation. Recent studies have demonstrated that transrectal sonography can detect nonpalpable tumors, which are usually potentially curable. As a result, some physicians now recommend routine screening of all men over age fifty. The main goal of a cancer screening test is to help reduce mortality. To date, it has been shown that screening can increase early detection and survival, but there is no experimental evidence that screening reduces mortality. Therefore, screening for prostate cancer may not be worthwhile. The large number of prostate tumors found on autopsy series indicates that only a small fraction of patients with prostate cancer actually die of it. The risk of screening is that many insignificant tumors may be diagnosed and patients may be treated unnecessarily, resulting in significant morbidity, mortality, and expense. For now, it may be appropriate to let patients choose whether or not to have the test performed, after informing them screening can increase early detection, but could also result in overdiagnosis and treatment. However, screening should not be advocated across-the-board until a randomized, carefully controlled, large-scale clinical trial has shown that it saves lives.\r"

However, significant differences of survival curves between these two treatment modalities are not apparent when comparing stage-matched results of uncontrolled studies. Morbidity of radical prostatectomy has decreased due to improved surgical techniques, but is still higher than morbidity following radiotherapy. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) may indicate occult persistent disease after radical prostatectomy. Adjuvant radiation therapy can reduce PSA to zero in these cases. The need for comparative studies to further evaluate the effectiveness of radical prostatectomy and radiation for localized prostatic carcinoma is emphasized.\r"

Flutamide exhibits its antiandrogenic activity by inhibiting androgen uptake and/or inhibition of nuclear binding of the androgens in the target tissues. At daily doses from 1 to 50 mg/kg body weight, flutamide reduced seminal vesicle and ventral prostate weights of intact male rats without affecting sexual potency. In addition, flutamide reduced the rate of DNA synthesis in the prostate of rats to a greater degree than other steroidal antiandrogens. The antiandrogenic activity was corroborated by the inhibition of androgen-induced prostate hypertrophy in orchiectomized rats through the use of testosterone, testosterone propionate, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone. Flutamide, given orally, reduced prostatic size in aged dogs with benign prostate hyperplasia after six weeks and one year. The baboon prostate was also reduced in size when flutamide was administered three times a week for four weeks.\r"

Numerous histologic grading schemes specific for prostate carcinomas have been developed, but pathologists and urologists do not agree on which system is most accurate. Unfortunately, the Broders system, which is frequently used, tends to underestimate tumor grade and malignant potential. Recently, computer-assisted nuclear morphometry has added objectivity to the formerly subjective grading process, and improved prognostic accuracy for early and advanced disease. The relationship between tumor volume and grade remains controversial. Although it has been stated that volume and grade are directly related, our examination of radical prostatectomy specimens casts some doubt on this. While it can be shown that tumor volume is proportional to the surface area of capsular penetration by malignant cells, tumor penetration is more closely related to histologic grade.\r"

An increasing plasma estrogen/testosterone ratio with age, and the presence of estrogen receptors in the prostatic stroma, indicate that estrogen also may be involved in the development of BPH. Symptomatic improvement of BPH with androgen withdrawal therapy (including castration, antiandrogens, GnRH agonists, and 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors), as well as effective estrogen withdrawal with tamoxifen, strongly supports the endocrine pathogenesis of BPH.\r"

Over 5,000 patients have now been treated with alpha interferons, and from this experience, some general principles relating to the phase I-III testing of biologicals have emerged. Clinical trials of alpha interferon have suggested dose-response relationships and provided a clearer picture of schedule dependence. These trials have also indicated that the extent of tumor burden and identification of sensitive patient subtypes may be critical factors affecting the potential activity of biological compounds. Recent studies using interferon in the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis have also generated promising results, suggesting an even greater antiviral role for the drug. The toxicity profile of the alpha interferons is unusual. Fever and influenza-like symptoms occur in almost all patients at all doses and schedules, and are usually dose limiting. Somnolence and other generally mild CNS effects occur in a small percentage of patients. Hematologic toxicity occurs but is minimal at lower doses and is noncumulative and rapidly reversible at all doses. Gastrointestinal toxicity is mild. No other unusual or unexpected toxicities have been reported, and early reports of cardiovascular toxicity have not been confirmed in large trials. The full role of alpha interferon in antineoplastic and antiviral therapy will be resolved in the coming years. This review summarizes existing safety and efficacy data for the alpha interferons.\r"

Conventional intravesical agents used to treat these carcinomas have achieved only a variable degree of success, and have adverse side effects. Recently, intravesical interferon has been explored as a treatment for TCC and CIS. In a randomized, controlled trial, patients with CIS exhibited a significantly higher rate of complete response (CR) to high-dose (100 x 10(6) IU) than to low-dose (10 x 10(6) IU) interferon (45% vs 6%, respectively, p less than 0.0001). To date, 9/19 patients in the high-dose CR group have maintained a CR for at least six months. Five patients receiving high-dose therapy and 5 receiving low-dose therapy subsequently underwent cystectomy, but median time to surgery was 33.5 weeks for the high-dose group vs eighteen weeks for the low-dose group. Intravesical interferon was generally well tolerated. These results suggest that randomized clinical trials are warranted to assess the efficacy of intravesical interferon, as compared to BCG, for the treatment of CIS.\r"

The administration of cefonicid 3.5-5.0 hours preoperatively was intended to simulate situations where surgery may be delayed or prolonged. The trial was double-blind, and patients were randomized to one of the three regimens. Operative site infections were noted in 6.2 percent of patients (7/113) who received cefonicid 3.5-5.0 hours preoperatively, in 7.0 percent of patients (3/43) who received cefonicid 0.5-1.0 hour preoperatively, and in 4.3 percent of patients (2/46) who received cefoxitin (p greater than 0.05). Enterococci were isolated most frequently from operative-site infections. When administered 3.5-5.0 hours preoperatively, cefonicid was as effective as more traditional regimens.\r"

  ".W": "Cimetidine, the first marketed histamine2-receptor antagonist, has been shown to decrease the clearance of warfarin consistently through inhibition of cytochrome P-450 metabolism. The clinical significance of this drug-drug interaction has been questioned due to: (1) the lowering of the warfarin therapeutic range, (2) the lowering of the total daily therapeutic cimetidine dosage, (3) the advent of once-daily cimetidine dosing, and (4) the demonstration that the clearance of the less active warfarin R-enantiomer is decreased to a greater extent than the more active S-enantiomer. Ranitidine has been implicated in both increasing and decreasing warfarin's hypoprothrombinemic-effect (noted in the warfarin package insert), despite the majority of investigations demonstrating no warfarin clearance changes. Careful examination of the implicating data indicates that the majority of the warfarin pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic variance that occurs with combined ranitidine-warfarin therapy cannot be attributed to a drug-drug interaction. No data are available to implicate the newer histamine2-antagonists, famotidine and nizatidine, in causing a decrease in warfarin metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Pelvic radiation therapy for cervical or vaginal cancer often leads to ovarian failure. To remove the ovaries from the radiation portal and preserve their function, they can be transposed to the lateral abdomen. Serial imaging studies in 14 patients who had undergone ovarian transposition (five bilateral, nine unilateral) were reviewed. Images obtained included 32 CT scans, 20 sonograms, and one MR image. Most transposed ovaries were located along the paracolic gutters near the iliac crests, creating an extrinsic mass effect on adjacent bowel. Detection of surgical clips on the ovary on CT scans allowed confident recognition of all 19 transposed ovaries. Cysts in the transposed ovaries, noted on most imaging studies, did not correlate with complications of pain or hormonal dysfunction. In one case, a large physiologic cyst in a transposed ovary distorted the cecum and was mistaken for a mucocele of the appendix. In another case, a large ovarian cyst was thought to be tumor recurrence or a lymphocele. These findings indicate that although the transposed ovaries can be recognized on CT scans by the surgical clips attached to the ovaries, the appearance of the ovary does not predict reliably the development of complications.\r"

In three patients with vein of Galen aneurysms, sonography showed a cystic structure with rapid or swirling flow. Careful adjustment of the color Doppler system was required to demonstrate flow in another patient with a dural arteriovenous malformation. An arteriovenous fistula in a fifth patient appeared as an area of increased flow. Arterial feeders and major draining veins were visualized in all five patients. Color Doppler imaging also was used to assess the effect of embolic or operative therapy in three of the patients. We conclude that color Doppler sonography is able reliably to characterize flow patterns in neonatal cranial arteriovenous malformations. Color Doppler imaging also is helpful in assessing flow after embolic or surgical therapy.\r"

MR findings in 20 healthy volunteers were compared with those in 62 intact postmortem hemispheres. MR techniques are described for the direct identification of the anterior ascending ramus of the sylvian fissure and the inferior precentral sulcus. These sulci, which border Broca's area and the primary motor area, can be reliably identified with sagittal MR. Four different types of sulcus topography were recognized. Most frequently, the inferior precentral sulcus is the sulcus posterior to the anterior ascending sylvian ramus (95% in the MR study, 87% in the anatomic study). Occasionally, an additional sulcus is interposed (5%, 10%), or an ascending ramus is absent (0%, 3%). Identification of these landmarks is important for the exact preoperative localization of cortical lesions as well as for the intraoperative interpretation of individual sulcus patterns.\r"

CT myelography separated subarachnoid cyst from myelomalacia and/or intramedullary cysts in four cases but failed to diagnose them in three, while MR accurately diagnosed subarachnoid cyst in all 10 cases that were also surgically proved. The results of these preoperative examinations were evaluated to determine the efficacy of each study in diagnosing subarachnoid cysts, ascertaining their extent and internal architecture, and detecting associated abnormalities of the spinal cord. In addition, during surgery these cysts were studied with sonography to gain an understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in their formation and propagation and to guide the surgeon in their decompression. On the basis of our experience, MR appears to be the most efficient preoperative study in diagnosing and characterizing acquired subarachnoid cyst and associated abnormalities. Intraoperative sonography provides a reliable means of ensuring adequate decompression of these cysts.\r"

We measured the accuracy of sonography for use in counting and measuring gallstones and gallstone fragments in a three-part study. First, specimen gallstones of known size were examined in a water bath with four different sonographic units. Second, seven pigs with surgically implanted gallstones had sonography before and after lithotripsy. Finally, we compared the measurements made on the preoperative sonogram with postoperative surgical specimen measurements in 27 patients who underwent cholecystectomy. In vitro gallstone measurement errors were 1.0 mm or less with each of the four sonographic units. In the animal experiments, all prelithotripsy measurements were highly accurate (+/- 1.1 mm). The animal postlithotripsy measurements were similarly accurate in five of seven cases, but substantial errors were made in the remaining two cases. In precholecystectomy patients, the sonographic stone counts and measurements were accurate in all 16 patients who had fewer than six stones. In all 11 patients with six or more stones, we correctly determined with sonography that at least six stones were present, but in only four of 11 cases was the largest stone measured accurately (+/- 2.0 mm). We conclude that sonography can be used accurately to count and measure gallstones when fewer than six stones are present, can reliably determine when six or more stones are present, and, in many cases, can determine the size of the largest fragments remaining after lithotripsy.\r"

Special attention was paid to the Doppler waveform of the hepatic artery of the graft and to the resistive index. An increase of the index above 0.80 was not specific for, but was always associated with graft dysfunction (rejection, primary nonfunction, multiple organ failure, or portal vein thrombosis). DISIDA scintigraphy also lacked specificity and was of limited value in the detection of postoperative complications. It proved useful in routine imaging to monitor atrophy of the native liver and hypertrophy of the transplant. Cholangiography was useful for visualization of the biliary tree. Our experience suggests that these three noninvasive imaging procedures are sufficient for the proper postoperative evaluation of patients after auxiliary partial liver transplantation.\r"

To determine if this belief is true, we prospectively obtained sonograms before and after biphasic upper gastrointestinal examinations in 40 patients. The 80 sonograms were randomized and blindly interpreted by two radiologists who used a scale from 0 to 4 to rate the appearance of six anatomic areas (gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, porta hepatis, and right and left lobes of the liver). The results showed no degradation of the image of these structures on the sonograms obtained after the barium meal compared with the prebarium sonograms. We conclude that barium does not interfere with sonography performed immediately after an upper gastrointestinal examination. Consequently, when both studies are needed, a sonogram can be scheduled after an upper gastrointestinal exam.\r"

  ".U": "90023105\r", 
  ".W": "Because animal studies have shown that renal obstruction increases renal vascular resistance, we theorized that obstruction would change the Doppler waveform. We studied the value of the resistive index (RI) calculated from the duplex Doppler waveform to distinguish between obstructive and nonobstructive pyelocaliectasis in 229 kidneys in 133 patients. The RI is the peak systolic frequency shift minus the minimum diastolic frequency shift, then divided by the peak systolic frequency shift. Duplex Doppler sonography was performed prospectively in 70 kidneys with pyelocaliectasis before the presence or absence of obstruction was established. In 54 of 70 kidneys, the presence or absence of obstruction was proved by interventional methods (percutaneous nephrostomy, antegrade or retrograde pyelography, loopography), and in the rest it was proved by body CT, excretory urography, or surgery. Thirty-eight kidneys were found to be obstructed, and 32 had nonobstructive dilatation. In addition, 159 kidneys without pyelocaliectasis were studied to identify possible limitations of Doppler sonography in the diagnosis of obstruction. Clinical history and laboratory data were used to determine that 109 of these kidneys were in normal subjects and 50 were in patients with nondilated renal disease. There was a significant difference between the mean RI of the obstructed (0.77 +/- 0.05) and the nonobstructed dilated (0.63 +/- 0.06) kidneys (p less than .01). Analysis of the receiver-operating-characteristic curve showed an RI of 0.70 to be a good discriminatory level for obstruction, resulting in a sensitivity of 92%, a specificity of 88%, and an accuracy of 90%. All 109 normal kidneys had an RI less than 0.70. Over half (27/50) of the kidneys in patients with nondilated renal disease had an elevated RI (greater than or equal to 0.70). Ninety-six patients had Doppler examinations on both kidneys, and in only six patients did the RI values of each kidney differ by more than 0.10; all six were proved to have unilateral obstruction. Use of duplex Doppler sonography should improve the specificity, and thus the accuracy, of sonography in the noninvasive diagnosis of obstruction and should be used when a dilated collecting system is identified.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of endothelin on the canine coronary artery (N = 20). The left circumflex coronary artery was cannulated and perfused with arterial blood at constant pressure. Coronary blood flow was monitored by an electromagnetic flowmeter. Intracoronary endothelin provoked a vasoconstriction that was dose-dependent. At a dose of 500 pmol, coronary blood flow was reduced remarkably (91.0 +/- 5.4%, n = 4), and endothelin subsequently produced a fall in systemic blood pressure and ST elevation in the electrocardiogram. At a dose of 100 pmol (n = 9), coronary flow decreased from 16.4 +/- 1.5 ml/min to 12.5 +/- 1.5 ml/min (p less than 0.001) and coronary vascular resistance increased from 6.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg/ml/min to 9.9 +/- 1.9 mm Hg/ml/min (p less than 0.005). A cumulative dose-response curve to endothelin was obtained and the curves were shifted to the right after both verapamil and nifedipine administration. Therefore endothelin has a potent vasoconstrictor action that is attenuated by the calcium-channel blocker.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the problem of mural thrombi after acute myocardial infarction is uncertain. It is clear that the main therapeutic goal is the prevention of embolic strokes. Although it is known that the incidence of thrombi is greatest after anterior wall infarctions, there is uncertainty concerning (1) the probability of a mural thrombus; (2) the sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography in making the diagnosis; (3) the probability that a thrombus will embolize and result in a cerebrovascular accident (CVA); (4) the efficacy of warfarin in preventing embolization; and (5) the probability of bleeding with and without warfarin. To study this problem in patients who have had an anterior wall myocardial infarction, a model was created in which reasonable estimates for the unknown parameters were determined from published medical studies. The model was designed to consider patients if they were or were not treated during the initial hospitalization with heparin. The probability of thrombus was estimated at 0.30, sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography at 0.85 and 0.85, probability that a thrombus will embolize at 0.15, efficacy of anticoagulation of 0.75, probability of bleeding with warfarin at 0.03 and probability of bleeding without warfarin at 0.005. Probabilities of a CVA and of bleeding with and without warfarin were determined if all patients were anticoagulated, if patients with positive echocardiographic results were treated, if patients with negative echocardiographic results were treated and if echocardiographically guided therapy was instituted in which patients with positive echocardiographic results are treated and patients with negative results are not treated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) ejection fractions and cardiac output were measured, and ventricular volumes were derived. Seven patients (group 1) who had an increase in LV end-diastolic volume with PEEP and 13 patients (group 2) who had the more typical response, a decrease in LV end-diastolic volume with PEEP, were identified. Compared with group 2, group 1 patients had a higher incidence of coronary artery disease (5 of 7 vs 1 of 13, p less than 0.005) and lower cardiac output (3.9 +/- 1.6 vs 9.1 +/- 3.2 liters/min, p less than 0.005), LV ejection fraction (27 +/- 13 vs 51 +/- 21%, p less than 0.05), RV ejection fraction (15 +/- 6 vs 32 +/- 8%, p less than 0.005) and peak filling rate (1.32 +/- 0.43 vs 3.51 +/- 1.70 end-diastolic volumes/s, p less than 0.05). LV and RV volumes increased and peak filling rate decreased with PEEP in group 1, whereas in group 2 LV volume decreased and RV volume and peak filling rate remained unchanged. Using stepwise regression analysis, the change in LV volume with PEEP was related directly to baseline systemic vascular resistance and inversely to baseline blood pressure. Similarly, the change in peak filling rate with PEEP was inversely related to the change in RV end-diastolic volume. Thus, the hemodynamic response to PEEP is heterogeneous and may be related to LV ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Understanding the role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and how to intervene therapeutically in HDL action offers the possibility of even greater benefits. Epidemiologic studies have shown a strong inverse relation between HDL cholesterol and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Whereas several subfractions of HDL can be identified, none convincingly offers better predictive value than total HDL cholesterol. Apolipoprotein A-I, the major apolipoprotein of HDL, also is inversely related to atherosclerotic risk. Unfortunately, measurements of HDL cholesterol or apolipoprotein A-I are considerably less precise and less accurate than measurements of total or LDL cholesterol. The biologic phenomena responsible for these epidemiologic relations are not yet clear. Moreover, several apparently contradictory observations and puzzling exceptions to the simplistic inverse relation of HDL cholesterol to CAD suggested by epidemiologic studies have created considerable confusion. The current confusion is not likely to be resolved until HDL metabolism and the cellular and molecular events responsible for the apparent protective effects of HDL are better understood. One current hypothesis that could explain the protective effects of HDL is that it mediates reverse cholesterol transport, the process by which cholesterol is removed from sites of deposition and delivered to the liver for excretion. From the standpoint of current therapy, each intervention that changes HDL cholesterol levels must be evaluated individually, on its own merit, in light of its effect on atherosclerosis and coronary events rather than on alterations in HDL cholesterol levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this discussion, the inflammatory nature of the disease is emphasized. Four aspects of the pathophysiology of atherogenesis are addressed: (1) The role(s) of fluid mechanical or hemodynamic stresses in the focal initiation and/or augmentation of lesions is discussed in terms of the influence of shear stress on endothelial cellular geometry, compliance, membrane anisotropy (r), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor expression, intracellular potential and replication; (2) mechanisms of blood monocyte recruitment to the arterial intima, including the roles of chemoattractants such as smooth muscle cell-derived chemotactic factor and oxidized LDL; (3) the alternate or \"scavenger\" receptor pathway of the macrophage and its pivotal roles in foam cell formation and plaque pathogenesis; and (4) the emerging significance of various lipoprotein modifications, and in particular, the oxidative modification of LDL, which facilitates the uptake of the cytotoxic oxidized LDL via the scavenger receptor, thus providing a non-down-regulating mechanism for foam cell formation and plaque development. Evidence indicates that the antioxidant drug probucol prevents the oxidative modification of LDL, thereby retarding atherogenesis independently of cholesterol reduction.\r"

Results from clinical trials indicate that reduction in LDL cholesterol decreases the incidence of and reduces the risk of CAD. The National Cholesterol Education Program recently developed guidelines for the evaluation of plasma cholesterol in adults. Initial classification is categorized and based on the following values: less than 200 mg/dl is \"desirable\" blood cholesterol; from 200 through 239 mg/dl is classified as \"moderate-high\" blood cholesterol; and greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl is \"high\" blood cholesterol. Decision-making regarding therapeutic intervention is influenced by the presence of other lipoprotein risk factors, such as reduced HDL cholesterol and elevated lipoprotein (a), and nonlipid factors, including age, sex, hypertension, obesity, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and family or patient history of CAD. Persons with borderline-high blood cholesterol and established CAD or 2 other risk factors as well as those with high blood cholesterol should undergo lipoprotein analysis. LDL cholesterol is the primary lipoprotein to consider when determining treatment goals. Patients with LDL cholesterol levels greater than 160 mg/dl without CAD or 2 other risk factors and those patients with LDL cholesterol greater than 130 mg/dl with CAD or 2 other risk factors are initially managed with dietary therapy. The goal of treatment of hyperlipidemia is to reduce LDL cholesterol to less than 160 mg/dl or to less than 130 mg/dl in patients with established CAD or with 2 other risk factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Change in coronary artery disease can be semiquantitated by repeat arteriograms. Three randomized clinical trials indicate that rate of progression of atherosclerosis, as defined by arteriography, can be reduced, and existing lumen obstruction decreased. Tendon xanthomas occur in hypercholesterolemia, and reduction in xanthoma size with drug therapy suggests an improved atherosclerotic disease state. The clinician has a variety of pharmacologic therapies available. The role of bile acid-binding resins, fibric acid derivatives, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, nicotinic acid and antioxidants is each unique. Understanding the role of lipoproteins in atherosclerosis will help in selecting the most appropriate therapy for each individual patient. Medications not designed for their lipoprotein effects can significantly alter lipoproteins. Medications, such as nonselective beta blockers, can alter low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subclass distribution with no change in LDL cholesterol content. Such changes may eradicate part of the beneficial cardiovascular effect of beta blockade therapy. In the future, therapeutic choices may depend in part on lipoprotein abnormalities such as lipoprotein (a), apolipoprotein E isoforms, hyperapobetalipoproteinemia, LDL.\r"

After hemodynamic, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic data were obtained during the control ischemic periods, diltiazem (10 mg intravenous bolus with 500 micrograms/min infusion) was given and 15 minutes later ischemia reinduced. Diltiazem reduced mean arterial pressure (113 +/- 16 to 95 +/- 15 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and heart rate-pressure product (p less than 0.05) with no change in heart rate, pulmonary pressures or coronary (sinus, thermodilution technique) blood flow at rest. After diltiazem, times to ischemia-induced 1.0 mm ST-segment elevation (28 +/- 10 to 42 +/- 17 seconds, p less than 0.05) and new left ventricular wall motion abnormalities (by 2-dimensional echocardiography, 24 +/- 8 to 36 +/- 12 seconds, p less than 0.001) were prolonged without significant augmentation of great cardiac vein flow during coronary occlusion. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction decreased from 51 +/- 7 to 41 +/- 12% (p less than 0.05) during control ischemia, but declined less after diltiazem (54 +/- 12 to 47 +/- 14%, difference not significant; 47 +/- 14 vs 41 +/- 12%, p less than 0.01). Diltiazem can attenuate, but not abolish, some of the effects of myocardial ischemia on LV function during transient coronary artery occlusion. These data support the use of diltiazem as a beneficial adjunct that may be used acutely and safely during routine PTCA.\r"

Conflicting data exist, however, on the influence of LV loading conditions on these measurements. Therefore, simultaneous LV micromanometer pressure measurements, 2-dimensional echocardiography and continuous-wave Doppler studies were performed before and after preload or afterload manipulation in 16 patients with coronary artery disease. Nitroprusside (n = 9) was administered in combination with saline to maintain preload and achieve a 10 to 20% reduction in mean aortic pressure. Saline (n = 7) was administered (850 +/- 240 ml) to increase LV end-diastolic pressure 25 to 50%. All measurements were obtained during atrial pacing at a heart rate 10 to 15 beats/min above resting sinus rate. The administration of nitroprusside plus saline decreased LV end-systolic wall stress (94 +/- 27 to 67 +/- 14 g/cm2 X 10(3), p = 0.011) without changing LV end-diastolic pressure and end-diastolic dimension. Peak velocity (0.8 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.3, p = 0.044), velocity time integral (11 +/- 4 to 13 +/- 5 cm, p = 0.049) and mean acceleration (12 +/- 4 to 17 +/- 7 m/s2, p = 0.0014) increased significantly. The administration of saline alone significantly increased LV end-diastolic pressure (10 +/- 4 to 22 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = 0.0006), LV end-diastolic dimension (4.8 +/- 0.5 to 5.1 +/- 0.5 cm, p = 0.0001), peak velocity (0.9 +/- 0.3 to 1.0 +/- 0.4 m/s, p = 0.008), velocity-time integral (14 +/- 5 to 18 +/- 7 cm, p = 0.005), and mean acceleration (14 +/- 6 to 17 +/- 7 m/s2, p = 0.041). Thus, even a modest change in either preload or afterload altered peak velocity, the velocity time integral and mean acceleration. These data have important clinical implications regarding the application of Doppler aortic flow indexes in the assessment of LV function.\r"

Each protocol had a common end point: Diastolic blood pressure would either reduce 25 mm Hg or measure below 95 mm Hg. Each of the 66 patients studied attained the desired clinical response end point. Intravenous nicardipine produced a gradual reduction in blood pressure, was effective in maintaining blood pressure control during constant infusion and had few undesirable effects. These observations suggest that intravenous nicardipine maybe a useful addition to a limited number of therapeutic agents currently available to the physician for treatment of hypertensive urgencies.\r"

All had good left ventricular function and had been receiving long term oral beta-blocking therapy. Patients were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups: group C, the control (n = 40), received no vasodilator; group N (n = 40) received intravenous nicardipine at an initial rate of 3 micrograms/kg/min; and group S (n = 40) received intravenous nitroprusside at an initial rate of 1 microgram/kg/min. Vasodilator infusion was begun before surgery and infusion rates were adjusted to maintain systolic blood pressure between 80 and 120% of postintubation (baseline) values. Additional measurements were obtained before incision and after sternotomy. In groups N and S, arterial blood pressure was effectively controlled in all patients. Before the incision, pulmonary artery pressure decreased in group S and systemic vascular resistance decreased in groups N and S. After sternotomy, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index and rate-pressure product increased in group C. At this time, pulmonary artery pressure returned to baseline values in group S. In groups N and S, heart rate, cardiac index and rate-pressure product increased, but, compared with baseline values, systemic vascular resistance remained low after sternotomy. Ischemic changes were seen in the electrocardiogram in 11 patients (28%) in group C, 10 patients (25%) in group S and 4 patients (10%) in group N. The concentration of creatine phosphokinase MB was not significantly different in the first 24 postoperative hours in any group.\r"

Phase I, a 2- to 4-week placebo washout to establish baseline supine diastolic blood pressure (BP), was followed by 4 weeks of open-label nicardipine dose titration (phase II) to establish optimal dosage on a 3-times-daily regimen for each patient. After nicardipine administration, approximately 79% of the patients had supine diastolic BP less than 90 mm Hg or greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg below baseline. The reduction in systolic and diastolic BPs was somewhat greater in patients older than 60 years. After phase III--an 8-week double-blind comparison of dosage regimens of 2- and 3-times-daily--all patients returned to a 3-times-daily regimen at their optimal daily dosage for 40 weeks of open treatment (phase IV). Supplemental treatment with a diuretic or a beta blocker was required by 67 patients. By the end of phase IV, more than 100 patients had completed 1 year of nicardipine monotherapy (mean supine diastolic BP = 85 mm Hg, approximately 14 mm Hg below baseline). Finally, patients were randomly assigned to continue nicardipine on a double-blind basis or take a matching placebo for 6 weeks (phase V, n = 101). The nicardipine group had only a slight change in supine diastolic BP, whereas those receiving placebo had statistically significant increases in supine diastolic BP toward baseline values. Adverse experiences, attributed to the vasodilatory effects of nicardipine, tended to occur in the first few months of the study and resulted in early withdrawal of 30 patients. Overall, these results show that nicardipine is a well-tolerated antihypertensive agent with efficacy sustained during 1 year of treatment.\r"

The addition of protein increased the insulin responses to both carbohydrates and slightly reduced the glycemic response to mashed potato (F = 2.04, p less than 0.05). The further addition of fat reduced the glycemic response to mashed potato (F = 14.63, p less than 0.001) without any change in the blood glucose response to spaghetti (F = 0.94, NS). The different responses to coingestion of protein and fat reduced the difference between the glycemic responses to the two carbohydrates.\r"

Blood samples were assessed for competitive interactions by analyzing the following metabolites: glucose, insulin, lactate, pyruvate, ketones (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate), elimination of triglycerides, and free fatty acids. Evaluation of the data showed a strong competitive interaction between the MCT and LCT emulsions. This competition was evident as soon as LCTs were added to the MCT infusions and appeared to favor LCTs for removal and metabolism over MCTs. This appears to indicate that there is a peripheral, strong affinity site for LCT removal and metabolism and a shared peripheral site and specific visceral site for MCT removal and metabolism.\r"

Recently, impression cytology was suggested as a method for early detection of this condition. A clinical trial was conducted to compare the results of impression cytology with the other two indicators of vitamin A status. A total of 246 children aged 1-10 y were investigated. About 25% of the children with normal eyes showed abnormal cytology. Their mean vitamin A concentrations were significantly lower compared with those with normal cytology, which suggests that abnormal cytology reflects subclinical deficiency. After treatment with vitamin A, most of the children who had abnormal cytology at baseline examination showed improvement. These observations suggest that abnormal cytology is specific to vitamin A deficiency. Impression cytology is a relatively simple technique and can be used for assessing the magnitude of the problem, especially in communities where the prevalence of clinical disease is low.\r"

This antibody, NGFR5, reacted strongly with 100% of 25 nerve sheath tumors. Eight of nine pheochromocytomas and three of three paragangliomas also had positive results, but the immunoreactivity was restricted to the sustentacular cell population. Within cells of melanocytic lineage, there was no immunostaining of melanocytes in normal epidermis, whereas 13 of 14 benign nevi had positive results, primarily involving spindled nevocytic structures within the dermis. NGF receptor was scarcely expressed in human melanoma; 9 of 19 melanomas had positive results, but immunoreactivity was generally restricted to rare cells within the larger tumor cell population. Among nonneurogenic mesenchymal tumors, results were generally negative: 0 of 5 chondrosarcomas, 0 of 6 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 0 of 3 meningiomas, and 1 of 8 leiomyosarcomas were immunoreactive. Carcinomas were variable in immunoreactivity: 12 of 16 squamous cell carcinomas had positive results, whereas adenocarcinomas demonstrated focal, basal epithelial immunoreactivity and neuroendocrine tumors generally had negative results. Among normal tissues, in addition to expected neural immunostaining, NGFR 5 reacted positively with several nonneural cell types, including lymphoidal follicular dendritic cells, myoepithelial cells, vascular adventitia, and basal epithelium of oral mucosa and hair follicles. Antibodies to NGF receptor may play a role in the identification of benign and malignant soft tissue lesions.\r"

L-1 immunoreactivity was evaluated in the frontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus/lateral ventricle, cerebellum, medulla, and spinal cord from 27 normal human fetuses, neonates, and adults without neurologic disease and in these same regions and representative lesions from 35 patients with diseases producing varying degrees of astrocytosis, including intraparenchymal hemorrhage; embolic, thrombotic, or traumatic infarctions; and Alzheimer's disease (AD). L-1 immunoreactivity was identified in ependymocytes, choroid plexus epithelia, and scattered subependymal astrocytes throughout the ventricular system from 15 weeks gestation through 82 years of age in both normal and diseased CNSs. L-1 immunoreactivity was also detected in reactive astrocytes and many macrophages surrounding each infarction regardless of site or pathogenesis and in scattered reactive astrocytes in people with AD or SDAT. The limited distribution of L-1 in CNS is consistent with the low amounts of L-1 found in brain and suggests that L-1 may participate in the normal function of ependymocytes and the pathophysiology of reactive astrocytosis.\r"

Recovery of lesional tissue is a function of localization within the specimen, whereas histologic demonstration is a function of localization within the paraffin block. Both localizations are pitfalls enroute to accurate diagnosis of the small mammographic lesion. A technique of specimen analysis is presented that uses a specimen holder to assure precise localization of the lesion within the biopsy tissue. The excised specimen is immobilized within the holder, which incorporates a reference grid visible in the specimen radiograph and on the holder surface. The target lesion can be localized in the reference grid of the specimen radiograph and then excised from the corresponding area of the specimen, which remains in the holder until presented to the gross pathologist. Localization of the lesion within a specific paraffin block(s) will permit additional histologic levels for optimal examination while minimizing histologic work load. The advantages of this approach are discussed and contrasted with variations of standard gross technique.\r"

The authors evaluated a shell vial centrifugation method to detect these viruses 16-18 hours postinoculation and compared it with conventional tube cell culture. Rhesus monkey kidney cells were used in both methods. Conventional culture of 334 respiratory specimens recovered 64 influenza isolates; the average time to positivity was 4.1 days. Low-speed shell vial centrifugation with polyclonal immunofluorescent staining 16-18 hours postinoculation was performed on 96 fresh specimens and on an additional 38 frozen specimens. These 134 specimens contained 49 of the 64 total influenza-positive specimens. The shell vial method yielded a sensitivity of 90.9% and 87.5% for fresh and frozen specimens, respectively, as compared with conventional tube cell culture. The authors conclude that the shell vial method is an important adjunct to conventional culture for the rapid detection of influenza A and B in clinical specimens.\r"

The neoplasia, with a recognized clinical evolution of 11 years, was resected on two occasions and had not metastasized. Microscopic examination showed 4 mitoses/10 high-power fields, moderate cytologic atypia, and, ultrastructurally, abundant myofibrils with condensations. Immunoperoxidase stains had positive results for muscle-specific antigen and showed focal reactivity for epithelial membrane antigen and S-100 protein. Analysis of the ten cases (including the present one) reveals that this neoplasm has appeared with greater frequency in women with an average age of 52 years. All neoplasms have been limited to the breast at the time of diagnosis. As a group, they have better prognosis than other sarcomas of the breast, although the possibilities of recurrence or dissemination exist, even many years after the primary extirpation. The size of the tumor and mitotic activity seem to be of little prognostic value. Mammary leiomyosarcoma shares clinical and pathologic similarities with subcutaneous leiomyosarcoma in other anatomic sites.\r"

In generalized portal hypertension, intrinsic veins at cardia participate in the formation of gastric varices. Endoscopy and/or splenoportovenography and a high index of suspicion are required for the diagnosis of gastric varices. The incidence of gastric varices in patients with portal hypertension has been variably reported (2-70%), probably due to difficulties in diagnosis. In a small proportion of patients with gastric varices, chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy or significant variceal bleeding develops. Gastric varices can be classified, depending on their anatomical location, into gastroesophageal varices (a continuation of esophageal varices) or \"isolated\" gastric varices (fundal or ectopic varices). This distinction is necessary for management. Whereas surgery is recommended for bleeding fundal varices, in acute bleeding from gastroesophageal varices, sclerotherapy could be attempted successfully. In more than a quarter of patients, gastric varices disappear after obliteration of esophageal varices. Prophylactic sclerotherapy of gastric varices is not recommended.\r"

Therefore, we studied the expression of pre-S proteins in the liver and serum of 26 patients with chronic HBV infection, using immunoperoxidase staining and enzyme immunoassay. Pre-S1 and pre-S2 proteins were detected in a large number of patients in both liver and serum, irrespective of the disease activity. Serial sections showed that most cells positive for HBsAg were also positive for pre-S proteins. The localization of pre-S2 and HBsAg was similar, with cytoplasmic and membranous stainings of hepatocytes, whereas pre-S1 was expressed exclusively in cytoplasm. Serum levels of HBsAg, pre-S1, and pre-S2 of DNA polymerase-positive cases were significantly higher than those of DNA polymerase-negative cases. Membranous display of pre-S2 on hepatocytes was observed more often in DNA polymerase-positive patients, and their serum pre-S2 levels were significantly higher than those without it. The predominant localization of cytoplasmic HBcAg usually was associated with active, ongoing hepatitis. Its expression and DNA polymerase activity were significantly correlated. These results indicate that pre-S proteins in serum and the membranous display of pre-S2 on hepatocytes of patients with chronic HBV infection refect active viral replication, but their expression does not correlate with disease activity.\r"

  ".W": "Utilizing the rationale that the calcium channel blocker nifedipine decreases lower esophageal sphincter pressure, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of sublingual nifedipine in achalasia, a disorder whose treatment depends on reduction in lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Ten patients participated in this trial, completed diaries, underwent manometric determinations of lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and had testing of esophageal emptying rates by a solid-meal radionuclide method. Nifedipine, titrated to a dose of 10-30 mg before meals, was well tolerated. Compared with placebo, nifedipine significantly reduced the frequency of dysphagia, but some symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation, or nocturnal cough were still present most days. Nifedipine significantly reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure by 28%, a value approximately one-half that achieved by successful pneumatic dilatation or myotomy. Esophageal emptying rates, as determined by the radionuclide method, were unchanged by nifedipine. We concluded that 1) nifedipine reduces symptoms of achalasia, but substantial symptoms do remain during such therapy; 2) the suboptimal effect results from the limited, although statistically significant, effect of nifedipine on reduction of lower esophageal sphincter pressure; and 3) although we believe that nifedipine may be recommended as treatment for achalasia in the subset of patients whose overall medical condition places them at high risk for forceful dilatation or surgery, it cannot be recommended as a standard alternative to these other modalities.\r"

In both normal animals and animals with metabolic acidosis, increasing luminal flow rate significantly enhanced luminal ammonia entry. In contrast, luminal pH was not as important in determining ammonia entry. Analysis of the levels of luminal NH3 in these studies was not consistent with simple diffusion equilibrium of NH3. In animals with chronic metabolic acidosis, additional studies demonstrated that inhibition of the Na+-H+ exchanger had no direct effect on luminal ammonia entry. However, studies of ammonia efflux from tubules perfused with 10 mmol/L ammonia demonstrated significant transport of both NH3 and NH4+. Studies of luminal glutamine deamidation via gamma-glutamyltransferase in control conditions did not indicate a significant role for luminal ammoniagenesis in the superficial proximal tubule in vivo. These and other recent studies of proximal tubule ammonia transport significantly modify the traditional diffusion equilibrium (of NH3) model of ammonia transport. Luminal flow rate is an important determinant of luminal ammonia entry. Transport of NH4+, both into and out of the tubule lumen, represents a major component of total ammonia transport.\r"

Rates of ammonia production and net luminal ammonia secretion were measured in isolated perfused mouse proximal tubule segments. This approach combines the in vitro microperfusion technique with a sensitive bioluminescence assay for total ammonia and permits the determination of ammonia production and secretion rates in specific proximal tubule segments bathed and perfused with defined solutions. Luminal perfusion stimulates ammonia production by proximal tubule segments in a flow-related manner. The effect of perfusion is not dependent on intact Na+-H+ exchange. In contrast, the rate of net luminal secretion of ammonia is largely dependent on Na+-H+ exchange but not markedly dependent on an acid luminal fluid pH. These results suggest an important role of Na+-NH4+ exchange in the mechanism by which the Na+-H+ exchanger facilitates net ammonia secretion.\r"

  ".U": "90023461\r", 
  ".W": "The thick ascending limb of the rat influences urinary net acid excretion by reabsorbing both bicarbonate and ammonium. The bicarbonate absorption is mediated predominantly by apical membrane Na+-H+ exchange and occurs at rates that are comparable to or greater than rates measured in cortical and medullary collecting ducts. The ammonium absorption is mediated predominantly by apical membrane Na+-NH4+-2Cl- cotransport and enhances urinary ammonium excretion by promoting countercurrent multiplication of ammonium, which facilitates ammonium secretion into medullary collecting ducts. Studies with medullary thick ascending limbs (MTAL) in vitro have shown that the regulation of these transport processes involves both acute responses to changes in the luminal and peritubular environment and adaptive changes in tubule transport capacity in response to chronic systemic acid-base perturbations. In particular, an increase in potassium concentration inhibits ammonium absorption with no effect on net bicarbonate absorption whereas vasopressin inhibits bicarbonate absorption with no effect on net ammonium absorption. Chronic metabolic acidosis causes an adaptive increase in the ability of the MTAL to reabsorb both bicarbonate and ammonium. These results demonstrate that the MTAL is a site of regulation of renal acid-base transport and that ammonium and bicarbonate transport rates can vary independently in this nephron segment.\r"

The use of rubidium to apparently shift potassium between sites with different NMR characteristics (visibility) is strong evidence for such compartmentalization. The evidence that intracellular compartmentalization of potassium is of (patho) physiological significance is also indirect. Postulated roles for regulation of intracellular K+ activity, perhaps by control of compartmentalization, include enzyme activity, protein synthesis, and cell growth. There is also evidence that compartmentalization of potassium may contribute to the maintenance of a stable intracellular environment following potassium loading. The apparent magnetic field dependence of the visibility of K+ by 39K NMR offers the opportunity to explore further the phenomenon of compartmentalization.\r"

Fundamental issues that remain unresolved include (1) the identity of the CF gene, (2) the precise role played by the CF gene product in regulating Cl- permeability and protein secretion, and (3) the identities and properties of alternate pathways for regulating Cl- permeability and protein secretion that are not compromised in CF. The first issue should be resolved in the near future as molecular genetic approaches are used to pinpoint the location of the CF locus on chromosome 7. The second issue is more complex and will require the development of generally useful assays of Cl- permeability and protein secretion that can be used to assess the abilities of candidate CF gene products to complement, or correct, the functional defect in CF cells. Characterizing the precise function of the CF gene product may be difficult if the regulatory pathways that control these cellular processes are complex (ie, involve multiple regulatory steps and second messengers) or if the CF gene is a regulatory gene (rather than a structural gene) that represses or induces the synthesis of proteins involved in modulating Cl- permeability and protein synthesis. The third issue relates to the development of therapeutic strategies for treating CF patients that involve elevating epithelial Cl- permeability or modulating protein secretion by pharmacologically activating regulatory pathways that are unaffected in CF. In this regard, it is important to note that the stimulation of the Cl- permeabilities of airway epithelial cells by Ca2+-mediated secretagogues appears not to be compromised in CF. Pharmacological manipulation of this or other regulatory pathways may provide a means to activate the Cl- permeabilities of CF affected cells.\r"

  ".W": "Antithrombin III (ATIII) clearance from blood occurs by redistribution into the extravascular compartment and by binding to the endothelial surface. When, however, ATIII reacts with a proteinase such as alpha-thrombin, the complex is rapidly cleared from the circulation (half-life is approximately five minutes) by a receptor present on hepatocytes. This receptor binds a number of other serine proteinase inhibitors that are members of the class designated as the \"serpins.\" ATIII, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, heparin cofactor II, and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin proteinase complexes bind to the same hepatic receptor, now designated as serpin receptor 1. Proteinase complexes with alpha 2-antiplasmin, another member of the serpin class, do not bind to serpin receptor 1. Recent studies suggest that the specificity of the receptor for serpins may reside in the so-called D helix (nomenclature based on the structure of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor). The presence of ATIII on the surface of endothelial cells offers a unique mechanism for regulating proteinases formed during coagulation. Since this ATIII is probably associated with heparin-like substances and exists in a high-affinity state, the inhibitor rapidly binds proteinases such as alpha-thrombin. Once the complex forms, its affinity for heparinoids is decreased compared with ATIII, allowing the complex to dissociate from the endothelial surface for rapid clearance by the liver.\r"

Sixteen kindreds with the most common form of the deficiency, in which plasma ATIII antigen levels and activity are proportionately reduced, were studied. Two polymorphic deoxyribonucleic acid markers were used to resolve parental ATIII alleles and to trace their inheritance patterns. In 15 of 16 cases, the structure of the affected ATIII allele was indistinguishable from normal, suggesting that relatively small mutations, resulting in gene inactivation, are responsible for the lower ATIII levels in these affected families. In the remaining kindred, complete deletion of one ATIII allele was seen. Also investigated was the molecular basis for a qualitative form of ATIII deficiency in a French-Canadian family with normal levels of immunoreactive protein but only half the expected levels of serine protease inhibitor activity. Using polymorphic markers, the abnormal allele was identified, cloned, and partially sequenced from the propositus. A single G----A transition was seen in the first base of codon 382, resulting in an alanine----threonine substitution in the defective protein. This mutation, together with others in this vicinity, defines a minimal length for a fully functional thrombin-binding domain.\r"

Thus, antithrombin is critically placed to neutralize these hemostatic enzymes and thereby protect natural surfaces against thrombus formation. Furthermore, the catalytic nature of this specific set of heparan sulfate proteoglycans ensures the continual regeneration of the nonthrombotic properties of the endothelial cell layer. Alterations in the synthesis and/or placement of the anticoagulantly active heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of microvascular and macrovascular endothelial cells could be responsible for arterial and venous thrombotic disease in humans.\r"

Herein the efficacy of high-dose (at least 250 units/kg) ATIII supplementation in animal models of Escherichia coli endotoxemia or bacteremia is reported. An endotoxemic rat model demonstrated that: (1) DIC occurs very early, before the appearance of deleterious cardiovascular abnormalities; (2) ATIII prophylaxis attenuates DIC, metabolic dysfunction, and organ damage; (3) ATIII prophylaxis increases permanent survival; (4) ATIII treatment one hour after endotoxin challenge attenuates DIC, metabolic dysfunction, and organ damage, although not as well as when given prophylactically, and survival is not increased. An endotoxemic sheep pulmonary dysfunction model demonstrated that: (1) ATIII prophylaxis prevents the typical decrease in arterial oxygen partial pressure; (2) ATIII prophylaxis combined with alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor significantly attenuates indices of pulmonary dysfunction. An E. coli bacteremic baboon model demonstrated that ATIII prophylaxis and treatment significantly attenuate indices of DIC and organ damage and prevent death in an otherwise completely lethal dose bacterial challenge. In conclusion, prophylactic treatment with high doses of ATIII may be efficacious in disease states of impending disseminated intravascular coagulation, such as primary or secondary gram-negative septicemia.\r"

The hemostatic system hyperactivity as measured by this assay could be specifically corrected by rising plasma ATIII levels of several persons into the normal range. This indicates that the prethrombotic state can be defined as an imbalance between the production and inhibition of factor Xa enzymatic activity. The effects of warfarin on factor Xa enzymatic activity in persons with congenital ATIII deficiency have also been evaluated. At equivalent intensities of oral anticoagulation, the mean plasma F1+2 level in patients with ATIII deficiency was significantly elevated as compared with anticoagulated persons without this inherited thrombotic disorder. It is concluded that the effect of warfarin on hemostatic system activation is modulated by the endogenous heparan sulfate-ATIII mechanism. This suggests that the F1+2 radioimmunoassay can be employed to improve the understanding of the hypercoagulable state associated with antithrombin III deficiency as well as to develop more effective treatment strategies to prevent thromboembolic events in patients with this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Antithrombin III (ATIII) is the predominant naturally occurring inhibitor of serine proteases generated during blood coagulation [Rosenberg RD: Annu Rev Med 1978; 29: 367-378]. Since 1965, several assays have been developed that allow rapid and precise determination of ATIII in plasma. As a consequence, the existence of acquired ATIII deficiency in many pathologic conditions has been described. Acquired ATIII deficiency is based on decreased synthesis, increased loss or increased consumption, or induced by drugs. An inherited ATIII deficiency is associated with a lifelong tendency to venous thromboembolism. In contrast, the clinical significance of acquired ATIII deficiency has been less well defined. A precise estimate of the risk of thromboembolism in the acquired ATIII deficiency state cannot easily be provided, owing to the lack of studies in consecutive patients. In 1978, a purified human ATIII concentrate became available for clinical investigation. Despite numerous small studies, the value of ATIII replacement therapy in patients with acquired deficiency remains to be demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "Hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications are common in sick preterm infants and may reflect inadequate regulation of coagulation. All neonates have low levels of the pivotal regulator antithrombin III (ATIII) compared with adults. Plasma levels of ATIII are very low in preterm infants and are further diminished in infants with respiratory distress, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Babies with lower levels of ATIII in the cord blood have been shown to have a worse outcome than neonates with levels appropriate for gestational age, including higher mortality and increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhages and catheter-related thromboses. The origin of severe ATIII deficiency is unknown. Therapies with plasma replacement or anticoagulation have decreased the incidence and severity of hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications in high-risk infants in several clinical trials. These data lay the groundwork and rationale for potential use of ATIII replacement in deficient preterm infants.\r"

Based on these observations, a treatment regimen designed to maintain plasma ATIII levels between 75 and 120 percent of normal has been developed. None of 10 subjects with congenital ATIII deficiency treated prophylactically had evidence of thromboembolism, including four pregnant women at the time of delivery. Five subjects treated for acute thrombosis and/or thromboembolism, four of whom were pregnant, recovered without further thrombotic extension or recurrence. Heparin resistance was reversed in two subjects, both pregnant. Nine subjects with acquired ATIII deficiency also received ATIII treatment for venous or arterial thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation, all with low plasma ATIII levels. Two subjects with disseminated intravascular coagulation demonstrated improvement, one clinically, the other biochemically. All patients with congenital ATIII deficiency survived, but only five of nine with acquired deficiency survived, highlighting the importance in acquired ATIII deficiency of the underlying disease in prognosis. Survival rate was especially poor in subjects with arterial thrombosis in the setting of low plasma ATIII. Administration of ATIII concentrate was well tolerated. None of the subjects who received ATIII concentrate demonstrated evidence of an infectious transmissible agent. These studies demonstrate that it is now feasible to safely replace the deficient protein in congenital ATIII deficiency, either prophylactically or therapeutically.\r"
