  ".W": "This chapter discusses international aspects of diseases resulting from exposure to chemical pollutants in the environment, with an emphasis on developing countries. These countries share many of the same problems of air, water, and pesticide pollution that face the more industrialized countries. In developing countries, however, the problems are compounded by a number of unique situations, viz., economic priorities, high burden of infectious diseases, impoverishment, and absence of a regulatory framework for the disposal of toxic chemicals. This discussion emphasizes the importance of interactions among toxicants, malnutrition, and infectious diseases for both urban and rural populations insofar as these interactions contribute to disease. Toxicants not only produce disease directly but also exacerbate diseases with other causes. Specific examples from developing countries demonstrate how human health effects from exposures to environmental chemicals can be assessed. While they do not strictly fall under the rubric of \"developing countries,\" the public health consequences of inadequate control of environmental pollution in the East European countries should demonstrate the magnitude of the problem, except that in developing countries the public health consequence of environmental chemicals will be aggravated by the widespread malnutrition and high prevalence of infectious diseases. Much needs to be done before we can adequately quantify the contribution of environmental chemicals to morbidity and mortality in developing countries with the level of sophistication now evident in the charting of infectious diseases in these countries.\r"

  ".U": "91332413\r", 
  ".W": "The title of this article raises a complex set of questions. To begin, what happened at Alma Ata and the goal that emanated from it-Health for All by the Year 2000--are themselves controversial matters. At least there are some who are strongly critical of those events and ideas. Even without linking academic institutions with Alma Ata and HFA/2000, a controversy is spawned when one asks about the roles of such institutions in dealing with societal problems--which problems should a university address, and how deeply does a university become engaged in them, particularly if it carries the university out of the cloister into the trenches of societal conflict? Linking academic institutions with Alma Ata and HFA/2000 deepens the controversy but also provides a framework for examining the basic principles on which each is based, and for testing those principles against the realities of real world problems of health development. This article draws on recent critical assessments of both sides of the equation: a recent Consultative Committee to the Director General of WHO that analyzes the successes and failures of PHC development to date, and lays out conditions for greater effectiveness in the future; and the Technical Discussions of WHO on the Roles of Universities in the Strategy for Health for All that review traditional and progressive arguments about the roles of universities in their societies, and how HFA can be seen as fitting into that debate. The thinking contained in these documents provides ample opportunity to examine whether or not academic institutions should have a role that relates to Alma Ata and Health for All, and, in the end, takes the position that, indeed, this is an appropriate role for those universities prepared to make the commitment. The point is also made that such involvement cannot be effective if the scale of the institutional commitment is marginal--it must be substantial and institution-wide. An example is given of the Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan, an institution avowedly committed to a community orientation and to health services development. The Network of Community-Oriented Educational Institutions for Health Sciences can be considered a movement of educational institutions in this direction. It is functioning with considerable creative initiative in addressing issues having to do with problem-based teaching methods, community orientation, and partnerships with governmental health services.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cells of the mouse B cell clone, CH12.LX, receive Ag-dependent differentiative signals through their surface membrane class II molecules. The present study was performed to determine the role of class II cross-linking and cAMP in the successful delivery of these signals. Delivery of differentiative signals by anti-Ek mAb was increased by further cross-linking with a secondary anti-isotype antibody. Intact or (Fab')2, but not Fab forms of anti-Ek successfully delivered the Ag-dependent differentiative signal. Inability of monovalent Fab fragments to deliver the signal could not be attributed to an inability to adequately bind Ek molecules. The requirement for cAMP for class II-mediated signaling was also examined, because previous studies have implicated elevated cAMP levels as necessary for class II signaling. Both Ag-dependent, Ek-mediated differentiation and the Ek-mediated inhibition of Ag-independent LPS-induced differentiation were inhibited by the adenyl cyclase inhibitor 2'5'ddA, although elevation of cAMP was not in itself sufficient to deliver the differentiative signal. Inhibition of LPS-induced differentiation could be mediated by mAb binding to either Ek, Abk, or Abb on CH12.LX or an Ab-bearing transfectant, CH12.ABB1. This inhibition was abrogated by 2'5'ddA in the case of Ek or Abb, both of which deliver Ag-dependent differentiative signals to CH12.LX cells. In the case of Abk, which does not deliver such signals to CH12.LX, 2'5'ddA did not abrogate anti-Abk-mediated inhibition of the LPS response. The effects of 2'5'ddA were reversed by the cAMP analog, dibutyryl cAMP, and Ag-dependent-induced differentiation of CH12.LX or CH12.ABB1 was accompanied by an increase in cAMP levels.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently shown that engagement of the human monocytic Ag CD14 by murine mAb induces lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1/intercellular adhesion molecule-1-dependent homotypic adhesion. To determine whether CD14 plays a role in monocyte-T cell interactions, we tested the effect of anti-CD14 mAb on the proliferation of human T cells. Our results show that anti-CD14 mAb strongly inhibited T cell proliferation induced by Ag, anti-CD3 mAb, and mitogenic lectins. Inhibition by anti-CD14 mAb was epitope-dependent and required physical contact between monocytes and T cells. CD14 engagement did not affect IL-2R expression or IL-2 synthesis but induced a state of unresponsiveness that was not IL-2 specific; proliferation of anti-CD3-activated T cell blasts in response to both IL-2 and IL-4 was abrogated by addition of monocytes preincubated with anti-CD14 mAb. Inhibition of T cell proliferation after engagement of CD14 on monocytes was likely to result from delivery of a negative signal to T cells, rather than from disruption of a costimulatory monocyte-derived signal, because incubation of monocytes with anti-CD14 mAb also inhibited monocyte-independent T cell proliferation induced by PMA and ionophore. These results, together, point to a role of CD14 in the monocyte-dependent regulation of T cell proliferation.\r"

  ".U": "91332422\r", 
  ".W": "The potential role of Thy-1 in CD3/TCR complex-mediated signal delivery to murine thymocytes was studied. Ag-mimicking cross-linked anti-CD3 mAb stimulated suspension of thymocytes from adult (6 to 8 wk old) mice for a brisk free cytoplasmic calcium ion ([Ca2+]i) rise, low level of inositol phosphate production, and marginal increase in tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of 110/120-kDa and 40-kDa cellular proteins. Weak but sustained [Ca2+]i rise, low inositol phosphate production, and weak protein tyrosine phosphorylation were also induced by the cross-linked anti-Thy-1 mAb that mimicked the putative natural ligand. The signal delivered via either of these two pathways was however insufficient for definitively promoting cell death and DNA fragmentation in the adult thymocytes. Here we demonstrated that anti-Thy-1 mAb synergized with anti-CD3 mAb for inducing a long-lasting prominent [Ca2+]i rise, definite inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakiphosphate production, and extensive tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of 110/120-, 92-, 75-, and 40-kDa proteins, which resulted in marked promotion of cell death and DNA fragmentation in the adult thymocytes. This unique anti-Thy-1 antibody activity was confirmed to be directed to glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Thy-1, and was distinguished from the known anti-L3T4 activity that augmented the CD3-mediated signal transduction in a different manner. The synergistic actions of anti-CD3 and anti-Thy-1 mAb obligatorily required the cross-linking of the two mAb together. The anti-CD3 and anti-Thy-1 mAb cross-linked together acted on immature thymocytes from newborn (less than 24 h after birth) mice for rather more extensive promotion of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and cell death. In addition, they affected peripheral T lymphocytes for accelerating protein tyrosine phosphorylation but not cell death. These results suggest a novel function of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Thy-1 as a possible unique intrathymic intensifier of the CD3/TCR complex-delivered signal for negative thymocyte selection.\r"

The structural and functional similarities between alpha delta-dex and TNP-Ficoll for B cell responses led us to propose that alpha delta-dex could provide a model system for studying B cell activation induced by T cell-independent, type II Ag. In this report, we study the effects of Ig class switch and differentiation factors on Ig isotype production by murine B cells activated by alpha delta-dex, and directly compare these to responses obtained after activation by LPS. We show that an IL-4-containing CD4+ T cell supernatant (Th2 SN) stimulates large increases in IgG1 and IgE production by LPS-activated B cells, but fails to stimulate detectable levels of IgE by alpha delta-dex-activated cells, despite inducing high levels of secreted IgM and IgG1. This is correlated with undetectable steady state levels of both germ-line and rearranged (productive) IgE-specific RNA in B cells stimulated with alpha delta-dex + Th2 SN. Alpha delta-dex is selective in its failure to costimulate IgE production in that IFN-gamma-containing T cell supernatant (Th1 SN) and transforming growth factor-beta-supplemented Th2 SN selectively stimulate a large IgG2a and IgA secretory response, respectively. Anti-IgD conjugated to Sepharose beads, in distinct contrast to dextran, costimulates a strong IgE response. These findings underscore the importance of the specific B cell activator, in addition to IL-4, in the regulation of IgE production.\r"

These mice develop numerous inflammatory and arthritic syndromes and exhibit abnormal B cell functions as well as lower T and NK cell activity. In this study, the differentiation of NK cells in mev mice was examined to elucidate the underlying basis for decreased NK activity. Although NK cells appear to be present in mev mice, their activity was demonstrable only when the spleen cells were enriched by nylon wool passage. Similarly bone marrow cells from these mice could be shown to contain precursors of NK cells when they were passed over nylon wool and transplanted into irradiated recipients. The adherent cells from both the spleen and bone marrow of mev mice suppressed the differentiation of NK cells from normal splenic populations. These suppressive adherent cells were F4/80(+), AsGm-1(+), Qa-5(+), and NK-1.1(+). They were not cytolytic when cultured in IL-2. Antibodies to a number of cytokines, such as IFN-alpha, -beta, and gamma, or TNF-alpha, could not reverse the suppressive effect of the adherent cells. Addition of anti-TGF-beta antibody could, however, overcome the suppression, suggesting that TGF-beta was partly responsible for the defective NK differentiation in the mev mice.\r"

  ".U": "91332431\r", 
  ".W": "Diabetes is a T cell-mediated process in NOD/Lt mice, with a major genetically recessive component of susceptibility linked to homozygous expression of the unique H-2g7 MHC haplotype. Heterozygous expression of the H-2nb1 haplotype derived from the NON/Lt strain confers diabetes resistance both in (NOD x NON)F1 hybrids and in NOD mice congenic for the H-2nb1 haplotype. However, diabetes resistance is abrogated in F1 hybrids by NOD/Lt bone marrow reconstitution. To establish whether the generation of beta cell autoreactive T cells from NOD/Lt bone marrow-derived precursors required at least heterozygous expression of the H-2g7 haplotype on thymic epithelium, adolescent thymectomized (NOD x NON)F1 mice were implanted with neonatal NON/Lt thymus grafts before lethal radiation and reconstitution with NOD/Lt bone marrow. Peripheral T cells maturing through this ectopic thymic implant exclusively expressed the NOD H-2g7 haplotype and were tolerant to H-2nb1 skin grafts. Nevertheless, diabetes developed in 32% of the NON/Lt thymus-grafted chimeras vs 38% of the sham-thymectomized NOD bone marrow chimeras. Thus, homozygous expression of the diabetes-resistant H-2nb1 haplotype on thymic epithelium failed to block development of a diabetogenic T cell repertoire. To examine if expression of H-2nb1 on hemopoietically derived APC could alter the diabetogenic potential of NOD/Lt marrow, diabetes-resistant NOD.NON-H-2nb1 congenic mice were mated with NOD/Lt mice to produce NOD-H-2g7/H-2nb1 heterozygous recipients. These were lethally irradiated and reconstituted with either NOD/Lt marrow alone, NOD.H-2nb1 homozygous congenic marrow alone, or a 1:1 mixture of the two marrow populations. By 25 wk of age, all of the MHC heterozygous recipients of NOD.NON-H-2nb1 marrow remained diabetes-free whereas 75% of the MHC heterozygous recipients of NOD/Lt marrow developed diabetes. A striking decrease in diabetes was observed when T cell precursors derived from NOD/Lt marrow interacted with H-2nb1 gene products on hemopoietically derived APC, inasmuch as only 7% of the MHC heterozygous recipients reconstituted with a 1:1 mixture of NOD/Lt and NOD.NON-H-2nb1 marrow developed diabetes. Peripheral leukocytes in all reconstitution classes expressed the MHC phenotype(s) of the marrow donor(s). Skin grafting confirmed that all reconstitution classes of MHC heterozygous recipients were tolerant to the H-2nb1 haplotype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The LT epitopes were detected by surface immunofluorescence staining and by immunoprecipitation from radioiodinated or biosynthetically labeled cells with the use of anti-rLT polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The epitopes detected by the antibody were related to LT because adsorption of the anti-rLT with PMA-activated II-23.D7 cells resulted in the removal of the neutralizing titer of the anti-rLT antiserum. Immunoprecipitation of surface radioiodinated II-23.D7 cells revealed two bands of 25 kDa and 33 kDa that were specifically precipitated with anti-rLT, but not anti-rTNF antibodies. Enzymatic digestion with glycanases showed both proteins to have N-linked carbohydrate, with O-linked sugar limited to the 25-kDa protein. To determine the biochemical relationship between these proteins, the two LT-like forms were purified from detergent-solubilized II-23.D7 cells by immunoaffinity chromatography. Peptide mapping using CNBr cleavage showed the 25-kDa surface form to be identical to rLT, whereas the 33-kDa protein was different. Biosynthetic labeling studies showed that p33 contained both methionine and cysteine, whereas the p25 contained only methionine. Thus, the surface LT form lacks a leader peptide indicating an anchoring mechanism distinct from that described for membrane TNF. The nature of the attachment of this LT form to the membrane surface is not clear, however, neither TNF receptor binding nor lipid linkages appear to be involved. The accessory protein, p33, may anchor LT to the surface. These findings identify a new characteristic of LT and point toward an additional pathway by which T lymphocytes may mediate cytolytic activity and regulate inflammatory processes.\r"

  ".W": "The hemopoietic CSF, granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), are cytokines that mediate the clonal proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells into mature macrophages and/or granulocytes. We have employed an all-human cell culture system, specific ELISA for GM-CSF and G-CSF, and Northern analysis to investigate whether chondrocytes are a potential source of CSF in rheumatoid disease. We report that human rIL-1 stimulated in a dose-dependent manner the production of GM-CSF and G-CSF by human articular cartilage and chondrocyte monolayers in organ and cell culture, respectively. Increased levels of the CSF Ag were detected after 2 to 8 h stimulation with IL-1, and the optimum dose of IL-1 was 10 to 100 U/ml (0.06 to 0.6 nM IL-1 alpha; 0.02 to 0.2 nM IL-1 beta); neither CSF was detectable in nonstimulated cultures nor in IL-1-stimulated cultures treated with actinomycin D or cycloheximide, indicating the requirement for de novo RNA and protein synthesis. The IL-1-mediated increase in GM-CSF could also be inhibited by the corticosteroid, dexamethasone, but not by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Although having little effect when tested alone, TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin (TNF-beta) could synergize with IL-1 for the production of GM-CSF. Basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma each had no effect on GM-CSF levels. Results obtained by Northern analysis of chondrocyte total RNA reflected those found for the CSF Ag, namely that CSF mRNA levels were elevated in response to IL-1, but not TNF, and that there was synergy between these two cytokines. We propose that chondrocyte CSF production in response to IL-1, and the concurrent destruction of cartilage by IL-1, could provide a mechanism for the chronic nature of rheumatoid disease.\r"

  ".W": "Cell surface expression of the high affinity IL-2R regulates, in part, the proliferative response occurring in Ag- or mitogen-activated T cells. The functional high affinity IL-2R is composed of at least two distinct ligand-binding components, IL-2R alpha (Tac, p55) and IL-2R beta (p70/75). The IL-2R beta polypeptide appears to be essential for growth signal transduction, whereas the IL-2R alpha protein participates in the regulation of receptor affinity. We have prepared and characterized two mAb, DU-1 and DU-2, that specifically react with IL-2R beta. In vitro kinase assays performed with DU-2 immunoprecipitates, but not anti-IL-2R alpha or control antibody immunoprecipitates, have revealed co-precipitation of a tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity that mediates phosphorylation of IL-2R beta. Because both IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta lack tyrosine kinase enzymatic domains, these findings strongly suggest that noncovalent association of a tyrosine kinase with the high affinity IL-2R complex. Deletion mutants of the intracellular region of IL-2R beta, lacking either a previously described \"critical domain\" between amino acids 267 and 322 or the carboxyl-terminal 198 residues (IL-2R beta 88), lacked the ability to co-precipitate this tyrosine kinase activity, as measured by phosphorylation of IL-2R beta in vitro. Both of these mutants also failed to transduce growth-promoting signals in response to IL-2 in vivo. Analysis of the IL-2R beta 88 mutant receptor suggested that a second protein kinase mediating phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues physically interacts with the carboxyl terminus of IL-2R beta. This kinase may be necessary but, alone, appears to be insufficient to support a full IL-2-induced proliferative response. These studies highlight the physical association of protein kinases with the cytoplasmic domain of IL-2R beta and their likely role in IL-2-induced growth signaling mediated through the multimeric high affinity IL-2R complex.\r"

  ".U": "91332436\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that induction of synthesis of the two major human acute phase proteins, serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP), can be accomplished in the human hepatoma cell line Hep 3B, in the presence of dexamethasone, either by conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated monocytes or by the combination of IL-6 and IL-1. Neither of these cytokines alone caused significant induction of either SAA or CRP. In the present study we extended our earlier observations by evaluating the role of dexamethasone, the effect of different concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1 alpha in combination, and the possible role of TNF-alpha in regulating synthesis of SAA and CRP. Dexamethasone alone had no effect on induction of SAA or CRP. Incubation of Hep 3B cells with conditioned medium from LPS-stimulated monocytes, in the absence of dexamethasone, led to modest induction of SAA or CRP, but addition of dexamethasone potentiated this response in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained for the effect of dexamethasone on the induction of SAA by IL-6 plus IL-1 alpha. Checkerboard titration of IL-6 and IL-1 alpha revealed that increases in concentration of either cytokine led to dose-related increases in synthesis of both SAA and CRP as long as a minimal amount of the other cytokine was present. TNF-alpha alone had no significant effect on synthesis of either SAA or CRP, but the combination of IL-6 plus TNF-alpha led to substantial induction of SAA. This combination was less effective than the combination of IL-6 plus IL-1 alpha. No detectable effect of IL-6 plus TNF-alpha was observed on CRP synthesis. Both combinations of cytokines, IL-6 plus IL-1 alpha, and IL-6 plus TNF-alpha, caused increased SAA mRNA accumulation that roughly paralleled increase in synthesis. These data indicate that IL-6, IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and dexamethasone in various combinations are all capable of influencing synthesis of SAA in Hep 3B cells, whereas only IL-6, IL-1 alpha, and dexamethasone can influence CRP synthesis.\r"

AM of healthy volunteers incubated with recombinant human GM-CSF revealed incorporation of [3H]thymidine in vitro. The maximum incorporation was observed at 20 U/ml of GM-CSF on day 3. The proportion of proliferating cells incubated with 20 U/ml of GM-CSF from day 3 to day 4 was 8 to 11% of the total, whereas 3 to 5% of cells proliferated without GM-CSF. The number of cell nuclei increased 1.30- to 1.68-fold in the initial 7 days during incubation with 20 U/ml of GM-CSF, whereas there was a 1.07- to 1.13-fold increase without GM-CSF. Conditioned media obtained by the incubation with human lung tissue exhibited similar effects as recombinant human GM-CSF on macrophages. The effects were completely abrogated by antibody against human GM-CSF. Immunohistochemically, GM-CSF was detected in lung cells including AM, alveolar epithelium, alveolar interstitial cells, and endothelial cells. In contrast, recombinant macrophage-CSF did not induce the proliferation of human AM, although it has been known to promote the proliferation of murine AM. These observations suggest that GM-CSF plays an important role among the regulatory factors that locally support the population of AM in human lungs.\r"

  ".W": "We here investigated IL-1 modulation of cytokine receptors on murine bone marrow cells (BMC). In vivo, IL-1 treatment reduced greater than 88% of granulocyte-CSF, greater than 35% of TNF, and greater than 51% of granulocyte/macrophage-CSF binding to BMC after 3 h, and returned to base line after 48 h. However, IL-1 binding to BMC decreased greater than 30% after 30 min, dramatically increased greater than 9-fold between 6 and 10 h, and declined to base line after 48 h. In vitro incubation of BMC with IL-1 did not markedly alter IL-1 and granulocyte-CSF binding, suggesting that modulation of granulocyte-CSF and IL-1 binding to BMC by IL-1 in vivo is due to an indirect mechanism. Further in vitro studies showed that IL-1 binding to BMC was specifically induced by glucocorticoids rather than other steroids, and is a time- and dose-dependent process. IL-1 induced IL-1R up-regulation was suppressed by ketoconazole, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, in vivo dexamethasone imitated the action of IL-1 in stimulating IL-1 binding to BMC and in inducing neutrophilia. Furthermore, IL-1 binding to BMC from sham mice 8 h after IL-1 administration was 2.5 times higher than that observed in adrenalectomized mice. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that in vivo IL-1-induced increased IL-1 binding to BMC was due to an indirect mechanism, and glucocorticoids stimulated IL-1 binding to BMC in vivo and in vitro. Inasmuch as serum glucocorticoid levels can be elevated by IL-1 in vivo, these results reveal a novel mechanism by which IL-1 modulates its own receptors in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of macrophage (M)-CSF on the production of inflammatory mediators has been examined in murine peritoneal macrophages. Cultures of macrophages treated with up to 30,000 U/ml of human rM-CSF or with 10,000 U/ml of L929-derived M-CSF did not reveal either PGE2, IL-1, or IL-6 secretion. In contrast, LPS, which served as a positive control, stimulated production of significant levels of PGE2, IL-1, and IL-6. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis of macrophage RNA revealed a strong induction of IL-1 alpha and IL-6 mRNA by LPS but not by M-CSF. Conditioned medium from macrophage cultures treated with purified L929 or human rM-CSF in combination with LPS exhibited a significant reduction of IL-1 bioactivity as compared with an LPS challenge alone. To investigate the mechanism involved in this M-CSF-dependent reduction of IL-1 bioactivity, we measured IL-1 alpha gene expression. The addition of M-CSF to LPS-treated macrophages did not affect IL-1 alpha mRNA levels suggesting that M-CSF may regulate production of an IL-1 inhibitor. This hypothesis was shown to be valid because removal of IL-1 alpha from conditioned medium of LPS plus M-CSF-treated cells allowed the detection of a nondialyzable factor that blocked IL-1-dependent thymocyte proliferation. The inhibitor appeared to be specific because it did not inhibit IL-2 and TNF bioactivities. Furthermore, this IL-1 inhibitor, which binds to cells and not to IL-1, competed with the binding of radioactive IL-1 alpha or beta to EL-4.6.1 cells. The results demonstrate that M-CSF alone does not induce proinflammatory mediators and PGE2 as was previously published. The data also suggest that M-CSF may play a role in the down-regulation of inflammatory responses.\r"

  ".W": "To analyze direct intracellular interactions of CR2 in normal human B lymphocytes, we used polyclonal anti-Id anti-CR2 antibodies (Ab2) prepared against the highly purified CR2 molecule (gp140) as original immunogen. We previously demonstrated that this Ab2 contained specificities that mimicked extracellular and intracellular domains of CR2 and was helpful for identifying CR2-specific ligands. Indeed, some Ab2 specificities recognized human C3d and EBV, two extracellular CR2 ligands. In addition, other Ab2 specificities interacted directly, as CR2, with the intracellular p53 antioncoprotein that is expressed in transformed cells and not in normal cells. We demonstrate herein that Ab2 detected in normal B lymphocytes a 68-kDa protein, p68, that was not expressed in transformed B cells. p68 was localized in purified plasma membranes and cytosol fractions. Direct interaction of purified CR2 with purified p68 was demonstrated. Competitive studies supported that CR2 and Ab2 interacted with identical sites on p68. These interactions were calcium dependent. p68 was identified as a calcium-binding protein by its ability to be solubilized from B lymphocyte membranes by EGTA, a calcium-chelating agent, to bind specifically on phenothiazine-Sepharose in a calcium-dependent interaction, and to be recognized by specific antibodies directed against human p68, a calcium-binding protein of the annexin VI family. Thus, demonstration of different intracellular interactions of CR2 with distinct regulatory proteins, such as p53, the antioncoprotein, and p68, a calcium-binding protein, supports involvement of two regulatory pathways of signal transduction through CR2, depending on the normal or transformed state of human B lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Class I and class II MHC glycoproteins are highly polymorphic molecules that bind antigenic peptides and present them on cell surfaces for recognition by T lymphocytes. Even though MHC polymorphism has long been known to affect both peptide binding and recognition by the TCR, the role of individual amino acids of MHC proteins in these interactions is poorly understood. To examine the effect of a small number of amino acid residues on T cell stimulation, B lymphoblastoid cell lines homozygous for the closely related DR1 subtypes, Dw1 and Dw20, and the DR4 subtypes, Dw4 and Dw14, were compared for their ability to present an immunogenic influenza hemagglutinin peptide (HA307-319) to an Ag-specific, DR1,4-restricted T cell clone. B cell lines expressing DR1 Dw20 and DR4 Dw14 presented HA307-319 much less efficiently than DR1 Dw1 and DR4 Dw4 and bound a biotinylated analogue of the same peptide less well. Analysis of DRB1 gene sequences suggested that polymorphism at residue 86 had a major effect on peptide binding. Differences in binding of a set of HA307-319 analogues biotinylated at each residue to cells expressing DR1 Dw1 and DR1 Dw20 suggested that the polymorphism affected the interactions of many peptide residues with the class II molecule. In inhibition assays, DR1 Dw1 and DR4 Dw4 were shown to differ from DR1 Dw20 and DR4 Dw14 in their length requirements for peptide binding. Using a larger panel of homozygous B cell lines expressing many class II haplotypes, a Ser-309 substituted HA307-319 analogue was shown to bind to most B cell lines expressing Val-86 containing alleles (including DR1 Dw20 and DR4 Dw14) but failed to bind most B cell lines expressing Gly-86 alleles (including DR1 Dw1 and DR4 Dw4). The results indicated that polymorphism at residue 86 influenced the specificity and affinity of peptide binding and affected the conformation of peptide-DR protein complexes without completely eliminating T cell recognition.\r"

Analysis of J beta segment and V alpha chain usage in the V beta 5-positive T cell hybridomas revealed that a differential binding of MR9-8 mAb to the V beta 5.2 chain is not dependent on either the J beta segment usage or the associating V alpha chain alone. These results suggest that the differential binding of MR9-8 mAb to V beta 5.2 TCR is due to the conformational change of the V beta chain created by a combination of the V alpha (possibly J alpha) and D beta-J beta segment associating with the V beta 5.2 chain.\r"

  ".W": "Four hundred and sixty-six hybridomas were generated from a BALB/c mouse immunized with the syngeneic anti-idiotypic mAb F5-830 that recognizes an idiotope in the Ag-combining site of mAb AC1.59. At an appropriate concentration, the latter reacts with a determinant expressed by HLA-DR1, DRw8, and DRw9 Ag and subtypes of HLA-DR4 and DRw6 allospecificities. Serologic and immunochemical assays identified eight anti-HLA-DR anti-anti-idiotypic mAb. They are heterogeneous in their reactivity with a panel of HLA-typed B lymphoid cells: like mAb AC1.59, the anti-anti-idiotypic mAb MA1/38, MA1/40, MA1/47, and MA1/98 recognize the determinant shared by HLA-DR1, DRw8, and DRw9 Ag and subtypes of HLA-DR4 Ag. On the other hand, the anti-anti-idiotypic mAb MA1/52, MA1/157, MA1/281, and MA1/285 have a more restricted reactivity, inasmuch as the corresponding determinant(s) is detectable on only some of the allospecificities recognized by mAb AC1.59. Each anti-anti-idiotypic mAb varies in its extent of reactivity with HLA-DR allospecificities. These results suggest differences in the fine specificity of anti-HLA-DR anti-anti-idiotypic mAb and in the structural characteristics of the mAb AC1.59 defined determinant shared by HLA-DR1, DRw8, and DRw9 Ag and subtypes of DR4 allospecificities. Furthermore, the anti-anti-idiotypic mAb are heterogeneous in terms of expression of idiotopes and of their spatial relationship with their Ag-combining site. The heterogeneity in the characteristics of anti-HLA-DR antibodies elicited with anti-idiotypic mAb F5-830 suggests that the Id cascade triggered by immunization with incompatible HLA allospecificities may account for the changes in the anti-HLA antibody specificity that have been observed in the course of an immune response to mismatched HLA alloantigens.\r"

Mo3 is obtained by immunoprecipitation with anti-Mo3 mAb from lysates of PMA-stimulated U-937 cells. The Ag is a heterogeneous glycoprotein with a molecular mass range of 42 to 66 kDa (nonreducing conditions) containing N-linked carbohydrate chains. When the cells are treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, greater than 60% of total precipitable gp42-66 Ag is released in the supernatant. This phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-sensitive linkage to the plasma membrane has provided a means for the one-step purification of Mo3 by immunoaffinity chromatography. The eluted soluble Mo3 (sMo3) was greater than 90% pure as documented by the appearance of a single major protein peak on reverse phase HPLC and SDS-PAGE. The average yield was 12.1 micrograms/10(8) cells. Sufficient quantities of sMo3 have been purified to permit the determination of amino acid and carbohydrate composition. Complex N-linked carbohydrates make up nearly 50% of the glycoprotein content and contribute to its heterogeneity. An anti-Mo3 polyclonal antiserum generated from sMo3 was used to immunoprecipitate Mo3 and its precursor from biosynthetically labeled, PMA-stimulated U-937 cells or LPS-stimulated monocytes. These 35S-methionine \"pulse-chase\" experiments demonstrated the existence of a 40- to 42-kDa endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase-sensitive precursor, which over a period of 4 to 5 h gave rise to an endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase-resistant, but N-glycanase-sensitive 42- to 66-kDa mature form.\r"

  ".W": "The low-affinity human Fc gamma RIIa is encoded by a single gene with allelic variation, defined by low-responder and high-responder alleles (LR and HR). The HR Fc gamma RIIa transcript interacts strongly with murine (m) IgG1 complexes, in contrast to the LR Fc gamma RIIa. Furthermore, the transcripts can be discriminated by mAb 41H16, which recognizes an epitope expressed on the HR Fc gamma RIIa molecule. We report that this receptor is also polymorphic in its reactivity with human (h) IgG2. Binding studies using well-defined hIgG dimers revealed that LR Fc gamma RIIa molecules can efficiently bind hIgG2, in contrast to HR Fc gamma RIIa. Previous work of others showed one amino acid difference between the allelic forms of Fc gamma RII. We, however, found a second amino acid difference between both allelic forms. In this study, hybrid Fc gamma RIIa molecules were constructed to determine the epitope for mAb 41H16 and the binding domain for mIgG1 and hIgG2 complexes. Our data point to the importance of the amino acid at position 131, located in the second Ig-like domain of Fc gamma RIIa. When an arginine residue is present at amino acid position 131, the receptor is recognized by mAb 41H16. Furthermore, the receptor can bind mIgG1-sensitized indicator E, but binds hIgG2 dimers only weakly. When a histidine residue is present at this amino acid position, hIgG2 dimers do bind efficiently to Fc gamma RII, whereas mIgG1-sensitized E and mAb 41H16 exhibit a strongly diminished binding.\r"

  ".W": "An ELISA using antibody to properdin (P), followed by antibody to C3 to detect complexes of P with C3 (P-C3), detected low levels of P-C3 complexes in human serum and plasma samples. Incubating serum for 1 h at 37 degrees C increased the amount of P-C3 and diminished factor B hemolytic activity without altering total alternative pathway activity or C3 activity in serum. When P and C3 in incubated serum were analyzed by size exclusion HPLC, complexes of P-C3 were detected at retention times corresponding to molecular mass measuring in excess of 2 x 10(6) Da. Activation of serum with zymosan or cobra venom factor greatly increased the level of P-C3 and decreased alternative pathway hemolytic activity. Chromatography of proteins eluted from serum-treated zymosan detected a peak of P at 9.7 x 10(5) Da and a peak of P-C3 at 1.5 x 10(6) Da. Functional assays for activated properdin also revealed a peak of activity at 1.5 x 10(6) Da, congruent with the peak of P-C3. Native properdin was detected at 3.9 x 10(5) Da. When native properdin was added to properdin-depleted serum and incubated for 1 h at 37 degrees C, activated properdin was detected at the same position in the chromatograph as were P-C3 complexes. We conclude that incubation of serum at 37 degrees C produces complexes of P with C3, that exposure of serum to alternative pathway activators increases the amount of P-C3, and that generation of P-C3 complexes is associated with the presence of activated P.\r"

A humanized form of anti-Tac (HAT) has been constructed that retains the binding properties of murine anti-Tac (MAT). These two mAb were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys to compare relative immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic properties. Monkeys treated with HAT daily for 14 days exhibited anti-HAT antibody titers which were 5- to 10-fold lower than their MAT-treated counterparts and these antibodies developed later than in the MAT-treated monkeys. Two of four monkeys receiving a single injection of MAT developed anti-MAT antibodies, whereas none of four monkeys developed antibodies after a single treatment with HAT. In monkeys injected with either HAT or MAT daily for 14 days, the anti-antibody titers induced were inversely related to the amount of anti-Tac administered. Antibodies that developed against MAT were both anti-isotypic and anti-idiotypic, whereas those developed against HAT appeared to be predominantly anti-idiotypic. The pharmacokinetic properties, that is the half-life and area under the curve values, of HAT were also significantly different from those of MAT. The area under the curve values for HAT in naive monkeys were approximately twofold more than those for MAT, and the mean serum half-life of HAT was 214 h, approximately four- to fivefold more than MAT. These pharmacokinetic values were reduced in monkeys previously sensitized with HAT or MAT suggesting that the presence of anti-antibodies altered these parameters.\r"

  ".U": "91332450\r", 
  ".W": "To kill other cells, lymphocytes can exocytose granules that contain serine proteases and pore-forming proteins (perforins). We report that mechanism-based isocoumarin inhibitors inhibited the proteases and inactivated lysis. When inhibited proteases were restored, lysis was also restored, indicating that the proteases were essential for lysis. We found three new lymphocyte protease activities, \"Asp-ase,\"\"Met-ase,\" and \"Ser-ase,\" which in addition to ly-tryptase and ly-chymase, comprise five different protease activities in rat RNK-16 granules. The general serine protease inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI) inhibited all five protease activities. Essentially all protease molecules were inactivated by DCI before lysis was reduced, as determined from DCI's second order inhibition rate constants for the proteases, the DCI concentrations, and the times of pretreatment needed to block lysis. The pH favoring DCI inhibition of lysis was the pH optimum for protease activity. Isocoumarin reagents acylate, and may sometimes secondarily alkylate, serine protease active sites. Granule proteases, inhibited by DCI acylation, were deacylated with hydroxylamine, restoring both the protease and lytic activities. Hydroxylamine does not restore alkylated proteases and did not restore the lytic activities after inhibition with 4-chloro-7-guanidino-3-(2-phenylethoxy)-isocoumarin, a more alkylating mechanism-based inhibitor designed to react with tryptases. It is improbable that isocoumarin reagents directly inactivated pore-forming proteins because 1) these reagents require protease activation, 2) their nonspecific effects are alkylating, and 3) alkylated proteins are not restored by hydroxylamine. We conclude that serine proteases participate in lysis when lysis is mediated by the complete assembly of granule proteins.\r"

  ".U": "91332451\r", 
  ".W": "Adherence of neutrophils to endothelium is a key event in the sequence of inflammatory leukocyte responses. Double-color FACS analysis was used to determine the extent and kinetics of neutrophil adherence to rIL-1 beta-pretreated endothelial cells (EC). Neutrophils bound very avidly when the EC were prestimulated for 4 to 6 h with rIL-1 beta. Anti-ELAM-1 F(ab)2 fragments inhibited this adherence for more than 80%. On the other hand, anti-CD18 F(ab)2 fragments also inhibited the neutrophil adherence (40 to 50%). Combined use of anti-ELAM-1 and anti-CD18 F(ab)2 fragments completely prevented adherence. Neutrophils became activated as soon as they made contact with the rIL-1 beta-pretreated EC. First, neutrophils depleted of intracellular ATP showed a clearly decreased adherence completely dependent on ELAM-1-mediated binding, i.e., without additional effects of CD18 adhesion proteins. Thus, CD18 is activated during neutrophil adherence and then participates in the binding process. Secondly, the neutrophils responded with a transient rise in [Ca2+]i upon binding to rIL-1 beta-pretreated EC, which was demonstrated to be caused by endothelial cell-associated platelet-activating factor (PAF). However, the extent of neutrophil adherence to rIL-1 beta-pretreated EC was not affected by the use of the PAF-receptor antagonist WEB 2086, or removal of the EC-bound PAF. The only effect was a complete dependency of the neutrophil adherence on ELAM-1-mediated binding, although anti-CD18 mAb still induced 40 to 50% inhibition under these conditions. We therefore conclude that ELAM-1-mediated binding is the major mechanism for CD18 activation during neutrophil adherence to rIL-1 beta-pretreated EC.\r"

We now identify aggregated bovine IgG as the main inhibitory component. Heat-aggregated bovine IgG was capable of down-regulating expression of the macrophage mannose receptor in a dose-dependent manner without inducing changes in ligand affinity whereas neither F(ab')2 fragments nor nonaggregated IgG displayed any inhibitory effect. Depleting of IgG from heat inactivated FCS by protein G affinity chromatography completely removes the inhibitory activity. Moreover, readdition of the Ig eluate from the protein G chromatography column restored inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. Macrophages were able to clear exogenously added aggregated bovine IgG, thus leading to loss of inhibitory activity in macrophage-conditioned media as compared to sham-conditioned media containing aggregated IgG. These results indicate that aggregated IgG down-regulates mannose receptor expression by macrophage activation via interaction with Fc-gamma R.\r"

This isotypic bias, which occurred when the virus was inoculated shortly before or after a primary immunization, persisted in subsequent secondary responses. However, infection concomitant to secondary antibody responses did not affect their isotypic distribution.

Although IL-4 and IL-5 are necessary for stimulation of IgE synthesis and eosinophilia, respectively, the cytokines that regulate gut mast cell hyperplasia have not been identified. To address this question, 6- to 8-wk-old BALB/c mice were injected on day 0 and day 7 of Nb infection with a rat anti-mouse IL-4 mAb, and with polyclonal sheep (day 0) and rabbit (day 7) anti-mouse IL-3 IgG antibodies. Additional Nb-infected mice received equal doses of isotype- and species-matched control antibodies. Mice were sacrificed on days 12 or 13 post-infection, and mucosal mast cells (MMC) in sections of the small intestine were enumerated. Nb infection induced a 25- to 40-fold increase in MMC over that observed in uninfected controls. Anti-IL-3 or anti-IL-4 alone suppressed the Nb-induced MMC response by 40 to 50%, whereas both antibodies combined suppressed the MMC response by 85 to 90%. Anti-IL-3 alone had no effect on the serum IgE levels, which were essentially abrogated in the Nb-infected mice treated with anti-IL-4. Blood eosinophilia was not affected by treatment with anti-IL-3 and/or anti-IL-4. These studies demonstrate that IL-3 and IL-4 are physiologically important stimuli of mastocytosis in vivo, and suggest therapeutic interventions that may counteract adverse host responses to allergens as well as to parasites.\r"

  ".W": "Ly-49 (YE1/48, A1) is a dimer protein expressed on subpopulations of murine NK cells. It is a member of a superfamily of type II transmembrane proteins containing carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD). In the mouse genome, the detection of multiple restriction fragments that cross-hybridize with Ly-49 cDNA probes suggests the presence of related genes. In this study, we have isolated several genomic clones encoding portions of CRD sequences highly homologous to the CRD of Ly-49. By using primers based on the consensus sequences of the genomic clones, expression of Ly-49-related genes was detected by the polymerase chain reaction in various organs, including lung, kidney, liver, spleen, and thymus. Two full-length cDNA clones that are highly homologous to the Ly-49 gene were subsequently isolated from a lung cDNA library. At the nucleotide level, the two clones are 72% and 80% identical to Ly-49 in their translated regions, but their sequences are different from those of the genomic clones characterized to date. The two cDNA clones potentially encode type II transmembrane proteins containing CRD that are very similar to Ly-49. These amino acid sequences are also homologous to other members of the superfamily of CRD-containing type II transmembrane proteins, including hepatic lectins and the low affinity IgER (CD23). The homology is most evident in the CRD but is also significant in other domains. These results demonstrate the existence of several functional genes that are highly related to Ly-49. These genes comprise a subfamily within the superfamily of type II transmembrane proteins containing CRD.\r"

  ".W": "The CD19 molecule is a 95,000 Mr cell-surface protein of human B lymphocytes with two extracellular Ig-like domains and a 240 amino acid cytoplasmic tail. cDNA encoding human CD19 and the cytoplasmic domain of the mouse CD19 Ag were previously isolated. In this report, those cDNA were used to isolate cDNA or genomic DNA encoding the complete mCD19 protein and a portion of CD19 from the guinea pig. Mouse pre-B and B cell lines expressed two CD19 mRNA species of 2.7 and 2.2 kb, whereas myeloma cell lines were negative as were T cell lines. Similarly, among mouse organs, only spleen contained detectable CD19 mRNA. These results suggest that only B cells express CD19 in mouse, as in man. Sequence determination revealed substantial conservation, with hCD19 and mCD19 being 66% and hCD19 and gpCD19 being 73% identical in amino acid sequence. The cytoplasmic region of CD19 was most highly conserved with human/mouse being 73% identical and human/guinea pig being 83% identical in amino acid sequence. Isolation of the hCD19 and mCD19 genes and determination of exon/intron boundaries revealed that both genes were structurally similar and were composed of at least 15 exons, 4 encoded extracellular domains, and 9 encoded cytoplasmic domains. Six of the exons that encoded cytoplasmic domains were essentially identical in sequence in all three species indicating that these regions have undergone considerable selective pressure to conserve sequences. Thus, CD19 appears to be well conserved in structure and expression through recent mammalian evolution and the highly conserved cytoplasmic domains may play a critical role in the transduction of CD19-mediated signals.\r"

Similar results were noted when LAK cells were generated from the spleens of B and T cell-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency mice and when LAK cells were implanted into severe combined immunodeficiency mice. These data indicate that NK cells activated by virus infections or by IL-2 infusions directly or indirectly eliminate implanted LAK cells.

In multivariate analysis, a history of syphilis was independently associated with HIV seroprevalence in homosexual/bisexual male IVDUs, of whom 90% reported a history of sexual intercourse with women. Cocaine injection was independently associated with HIV seropositivity but not a history of syphilis on multivariate analysis. STDs, indicative of unsafe sex practices, are common in this population; efforts are needed to prevent sexual transmission of HIV infection among IVDUs and their sex partners.\r"

HIV was isolated from 15 (30%) of 50 specimens from asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic persons and from 1 of 3 specimens from patients with AIDS. The men with AIDS all had pyosemia and grossly abnormal sperm. In contrast, semen specimens from other seropositive men did not differ significantly from semen specimens from healthy seronegative semen donors. No abnormality in sperm count, morphology, numbers or types of leukocytes in semen, or other seminal parameters was associated with HIV shedding in semen. Zidovudine therapy did not affect sperm morphology or seminal characteristics. Thus, although patients with AIDS had abnormal semen, the laboratory parameters that assess fertility were not affected by shedding of HIV in semen or concomitant therapy with zidovudine.\r"

To determine the frequency of HIV-1 infection in CD4+ lymphocytes in vivo, peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocytes were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from HIV-1-infected persons with clinical disease ranging from asymptomatic to AIDS. Using standard and booster polymerase chain reaction analyses, study patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC) were found to harbor the HIV-1 genome in at least 10% of CD4+ lymphocytes, and approximately 10-fold less infected cells were found in those with asymptomatic infection. In addition, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with ARC frequently contained a higher absolute number of HIV-1-infected CD4+ lymphocytes than those with AIDS or asymptomatic infection. It is likely that this high level of infection of CD4+ lymphocytes is the primary cause for the progressive immunologic deficiency observed in patients infected with HIV-1.\r"

The outbreak affected 13 NICU infants (20%), 22 NICU nurses (24%), 8 other staff caring for NICU infants, and 4 household contacts; 2 seropositive infants (primary cases) received blood transfusions from a donor with HAV infection. Risk factors for infection among nurses were care for a primary infant-case (relative risk [RR], 3.2), drinking beverages in the unit (odds ratio [OR], infinity), and not wearing gloves when taping an intravenous line (OR, 13.7). Among infants, risk factors were care by a nurse who cared for a primary infant-case during the same shift (RR, 6.1). Serial stool samples from infant-cases were tested for HAV antigen (HAV-Ag) by enzyme immunoassay and HAV RNA by nucleic acid amplification using the polymerase chain reaction. Infant-cases excreted HAV-Ag (n = 2) and HAV RNA (n = 3) 4-5 months after they were identified as being infected. Breaks in infection control procedures and possibly prolonged HAV shedding in infants propagated the epidemic in a critical care setting.\r"

Three patients had symptomatic primary, 10 had recurrent (3 asymptomatic), and 1 (seronegative) had no HCMV infection. Severe clinical symptoms appeared when levels of viremia/antigenemia were greater than 50 infected PMNL/2 x 10(5) cells examined. Of 200 blood samples examined, 93 (46.5%) were positive for viremia/antigenemia and DNAemia, whereas 48 (24.0%) were positive for DNAemia only; 59 (29.5%) were negative in all assays. Follow-up of HCMV infections in heart transplant recipients showed that PCR can detect viral appearance in blood 7-10 days earlier than assays for antigenemia/viremia. On the other hand, viral disappearance from blood, as assessed by PCR, occurred weeks or months later than revealed by other assays. Detection of virus by PCR only was never associated with overt HCMV-related clinical symptoms. Of the 8 symptomatic patients treated with ganiclovir, 2 became PCR-negative at the end of treatment and 1 cleared virus from blood in the following weeks, whereas 5 showed persistent or recurrent infection.\r"

Analysis of supernatants from 13 isolates indicated that the plasminogen activator activity resulted from secreted streptokinases. These 13 streptokinases were antigenically related and bound all three plasminogens, indicating that the binding recognition sites were conserved despite the observed species-specific activation. In addition, all group C isolates tested demonstrated surface receptors that bound human, equine, and porcine plasmin. Species-specific plasminogen activation may be an early step in events resulting in infection and may account for the species preference of certain streptococci.\r"

This property is due at least in part to an erythrogenic toxin (ET). A preparation of physiologically active ET from strain NY5 group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and streptococcal products (SP) derived from the culture supernatants of ATCC strain 19165 group A streptococci were both potent inducers of NK activity. An anti-serum to ET reacted with two polypeptides in SP, one of which comigrated with ET when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Using an affinity column with an antiserum to ET known to neutralize its mitogenic properties, the NK-enhancing activity of ET and SP was partly absorbed and was recovered upon elution. These findings suggest that immunologically related ETs in different streptococcal strains play a role in the activation of NK cells. This novel property of streptococci may feature in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections and their protean manifestations.\r"

Mechanisms by which lysozyme killed Streptococcus pneumoniae, an important respiratory pathogen, were studied. Lysozyme caused optical clearing of pneumococcal suspensions and released fragments containing [3H]choline from their cell walls. Electron micrographs revealed wide-spread cell wall destruction and bacteriolysis. Breakdown of the cell wall appeared to be mediated mostly by the major pneumococcal autolysin, N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, because it was blocked by phosphorylcholine, a specific inhibitor of amidase, or by substitution of ethanolamine for choline in the cell wall. Blockade of amidase did not greatly increase survival of lysozyme-treated pneumococci on blood agar. Pneumococci in which amidase was blocked appeared intact immediately after treatment with lysozyme, but when they were reincubated at 37 degrees C in fresh culture medium they swelled and lysed. Thus, widespread triggering of the major pneumococcal autolysin is not essential for the bactericidal effect of lysozyme.\r"

To determine whether the MAP have a significant role in protection, 24 monkeys were infected with virulent Shigella flexneri 2a. After recovery, one group (with controls) was rechallenged with S. flexneri 2a; another group (with controls) was fed Shigella sonnei. The animals that were rechallenged with S. flexneri 2a were protected, while those that were fed S. sonnei experienced the same incidence of disease as controls. No differences in serum immune response to MAP after primary infection with S. flexneri were detected in immunoblots using lysates of S. flexneri or S. sonnei or in ELISA using water extracts of these strains.\r"

When the bacteria from these CSF samples were grown in broth, most of these cells lost some or all of their ability to bind the MAb(s) that were bound by the same organisms present in human CSF. When in vitro-grown cells were used for intracisternal injection of rabbits, the populations of Hib cells observed in rabbit CSF after the development of meningitis generally resembled those of the respective broth-grown inocula in terms of their LOS antigenic characteristics. Hib cell populations recovered in infant rat CSF after intranasal challenge again had LOS antigenic characteristics similar to those of the in vitro-grown challenge inocula. These results indicate that a population of Hib cells growing in the infected human host may be quite different, with regard to its LOS antigenic characteristics, from the same Hib strain growing in vitro or in vivo in animal models.\r"

Mice were live-captured in two Massachusetts sites where Lyme disease spirochetes are intensely enzootic. Pregnant females were housed separately in the laboratory through delivery, and mothers and their offspring were caged together until weaning. Each female and two offspring were then examined for evidence of infection serologically and by tick xenodiagnosis. All 14 mother mice examined produced infected ticks and exhibited serum antibodies to B. burgdorferi. However, none of 28 offspring tested produced infected ticks and only a few had evidence of circulating antibody. In a separate experiment, no young CD-1 mice, born of infected mothers, had IgM antibody to B. burgdorferi. It would appear that immature mice are not transplacentally infected with spirochetes and must be exposed to infected ticks before becoming infected and infective themselves.\r"

Fluconazole reduced mortality compared with that in untreated controls and at 120 mg/kg/day reduced the tissue burden of A. fumigatus 10- to 100-fold in liver, kidney, and lung. However, amphotericin B was more effective in sterilizing tissues. Both fluconazole and amphotericin B dramatically decreased or eliminated circulating aspergillus antigen. Prophylaxis with fluconazole, begun 48 h before sublethal challenge, sterilized liver and kidney tissues and significantly reduced the tissue burden in lung. Early treatment with fluconazole reduced mortality and reduced antigenemia but did not sterilize tissues. Fluconazole prophylaxis at these doses prevented dissemination of invasive aspergillosis. Fluconazole was shown to have activity in the early treatment and prophylaxis of experimental invasive aspergillosis.\r"

  ".W": "To identify risk factors involved in heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a cross-sectional study of HIV-seropositive men and their spouses was conducted in Nairobi, Kenya. Of 70 spouses, 40 (57%) were seropositive and 30 (43%) were seronegative for HIV. In univariate analysis, the presence of cervical ectopy (odds ratio, 4.7; P = .006) was the only statistically significant variable associated with HIV infection in women. After controlling for possible confounding variables using multivariate logistic regression analysis, the presence of cervical ectopy (odds ratio, 5.0; P = .007) remained the only independent predictor of HIV seropositivity. These findings suggest that cervical ectopy may be a newly identified risk factor for heterosexual transmission of HIV.\r"

  ".W": "Histamine-releasing factor (HRF) is a cytokine produced by mononuclear leukocytes when stimulated with antigens or mitogens. HRF is capable of inducing degranulation of basophils and release of histamine. To determine if respiratory viruses can induce HRF production, mononuclear leukocytes from healthy adult donors were exposed to influenza or respiratory syncytial virus in vitro. HRF activity was tested by culturing the supernatants with fresh peripheral blood leukocytes and measuring the percentage of histamine released. Significant enhancement in histamine release was found in both virus groups compared with that of media controls. Thus, mononuclear leukocytes from normal individuals produce HRF in response to exposure to respiratory viruses, suggesting that this cytokine, which causes basophil degranulation, may play a role in the mechanism of virus-induced bronchospasm.\r"

During the winter season 1988-1989, the reported cases rate doubled and then declined to the previous level. The peak was due to a type T1/M1 Streptococcus pyogenes strain associated with an increased case fatality rate (33% vs. 15% for other T types). The highest incidence rates were found in the age groups less than 12 months and greater than 70 years. Among a sample of 79 patients hospitalized in November or December 1988, a portal of entry, mainly cutaneous, was recognized in 89% of the patients and concomitant conditions in 67%. Among the clinical findings were signs of skin or soft tissue infection (41%), local or generalized pain (41%), vomiting or diarrhea (24%), cough (18%), and upper respiratory tract symptoms (12%). A fatal outcome was associated with high age, lower respiratory tract or unknown focus, leukopenia on admission, start of antibiotic therapy greater than 6 h after the patient's initial contact with a physician, and a rapid clinical course including multiple organ failure. Renewed awareness of the many facets of fulminant streptococcal infection represents one approach to minimize the case fatality rate.\r"

To investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in systemic prostacyclin release in gram-negative septicemia, the plasma concentrations of its stable metabolite 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) were sequentially measured after intravenous bolus injections of recombinant human TNF (50 micrograms/m2; n = 6) and Escherichia coli endotoxin (2 ng/kg; n = 3) in healthy men. TNF induced a rapid increase in plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha from 0.11 +/- 0.01 to 0.44 +/- 0.15 ng/ml after 30 min (P less than .001). Endotoxin also elicited a rise in plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, but peak values were reached only after 90 min (from 0.07 +/- 0.01 to 0.19 +/- 0.04 ng/ml; P less than .002). These results indicate that TNF may serve as an intermediate factor in systemic elaboration of prostacyclin in endotoxemia and gram-negative septicemia.\r"

The study was terminated early for safety reasons after only four ciprofloxacin and four control patients had been enrolled. Ciprofloxacin was well absorbed and efficiently entered erythrocytes; median plasma and red cell concentrations 90 min after the first dose were 4.0 (range, 3.7-6.8) and 5.1 (3.8-6.0) micrograms/ml, respectively.

Nine of 12 control mice developed neurologic signs and died from CM approximately 2 weeks after infection. All 12 mice treated with daily intraperitoneal pentoxifylline (1 mg) for 10 days after infection did not develop CM. All surviving mice developed high parasitemia and severe anemia and died 2 weeks later without neurologic signs. In pentoxifylline-treated mice, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) bioactivity was nondetectable, whereas control mice had high TNF levels on day 6 after infection. These findings were supported by in vitro investigations of malaria antigen-induced TNF synthesis. Northern blot analysis of TNF mRNA from stimulated macrophages showed that pentoxifylline inhibited TNF expression at the transcription level, and TNF bioactivity in supernatants was strongly depressed. These findings make pentoxifylline a potential candidate for study as a supportive agent in human CM.\r"

A strong association of parental alcoholism with alcoholism among the proband addicts was found, suggesting some specificity for drug versus alcohol abuse. We also found that among the 477 siblings, those with alcoholism alone did not have parents with drug abuse and those parents with drug abuse did not have children with alcoholism alone. Rates of parental alcoholism were higher in alcoholic female than in alcoholic male probands, suggesting greater female \"loading\" was needed in order to become alcoholic. This increased loading in women was also found among the siblings, but alcoholic parents appeared to transmit a nonspecific tendency for either drug or alcohol abuse to their female children. Thus, it may take a greater \"dose\" of parental transmission for a woman to become a substance abuser, and transmission of alcoholism may be specific in men, but not in women.\r"

This is followed by a brief description of the historical context and development of current conceptualizations of antisocial personality. Some possible sources of diagnostic unreliability and instability that could serve to limit the validity of the APD diagnosis are then discussed. Finally, evidence indicating considerable psychiatric heterogeneity within APD substance abusers is described. The findings indicate that although APD substance abusers satisfy many of the criteria for a clinical subtype, the fit is sufficiently imprecise to suggest the need for further refinement. We attempt to point out some of the critical questions, issues, and lines of research that could help to guide future efforts to clarify, refine, and revise the APD formulation, particularly as it applies to substance abusers.\r"

Although a variety of explanatory hypotheses involving self-medication have been proposed, few data available regarding schizophrenic patients' subjective experiences while using alcohol. We report interview data from 75 DSM-III-R schizophrenic outpatients regarding their subjective responses to alcohol. Over half of our sample reported that alcohol improved social anxiety, tension, dysphoria, apathy, anhedonia, and sleep difficulties. Other nonpsychotic experiences were frequently improved as well. In contrast, no more than 15% of subjects reported that alcohol relieved any specific psychotic symptom; similar proportions of subjects reported that alcohol aggravated psychotic symptoms. Reporting that alcohol had a positive effect on nonpsychotic experiences was associated with having lifetime alcohol use disorders. Reporting that alcohol relieved psychotic symptoms was associated both with having lifetime alcohol use disorders and with the number of psychotic symptoms reported. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding alcohol abuse and dependence among schizophrenics.\r"

The reporting of a significantly higher level of depressive symptoms by alcoholics with a history of experiencing hallucinations during withdrawal suggests that in some alcoholics, there exists a vulnerability for mood abnormalities which includes a predisposition toward other abnormal mental phenomena such as perceptual distortions.\r"

  ".U": "91332559\r", 
  ".W": "We evaluated 102 adult victims of low socioeconomic status living in tent camps 8 months following the Armero disaster in Colombia to ascertain the level of psychiatric morbidity. Ninety-one percent of the subjects identified by the screening instrument as being emotionally distressed met DSM-III criteria for a psychiatric disorder. The most frequent diagnoses were posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression. These findings indicate that a simple screening instrument can be reliably used for the detection of significant emotional problems among disaster victims. They also show that these victims are not merely distressed; rather, they present clear and treatable psychiatric disorders that center on anxiety and depression. Interventions for their adequate management need to be designed, implemented, and evaluated. In a developing country, however, the high prevalence of mental disorders among disaster victims far exceeds the specialized mental health resources. The general health sector, particularly the primary level of care, must participate actively in the delivery of mental health services to meet this need, particularly for a socioeconomically disadvantaged population. The narrow range of psychiatric disorders detected among the disaster victims makes it possible to circumscribe the training of the primary care worker in disaster mental health to these priority conditions.\r"

The sample consisted of 64 patients who had received approximately 20 sessions of short-term individual psychotherapy within a controlled, clinical-trial investigation. Ratings of therapeutic alliance were provided independently by the patient and the therapist after each session. Outcome measures, which were provided by three sources (patient, therapist, and independent assessor), covered the areas of interpersonal functioning, psychiatric symptomatology, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. Quality of object relations, which characterizes the patient's lifelong pattern of relationships, was the best predictor. It was significantly related to patient-rated and therapist-rated therapeutic alliance and to patient improvement of both general symptomatology and specific target problems. The study also replicated previous studies that have reported significant relationships between therapeutic alliance and therapy outcome. The advantages of pretherapy predictors of therapy outcome, such as quality of object relations, are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91332580\r", 
  ".W": "Spasticity develops after supraspinal or spinal lesions of descending motor systems, with obligate involvement of the corticospinal tract. Spasticity is characterized by an increase in muscle tone, which, in contrast to many other types of enhanced muscle tone, shows a marked velocity-dependent increase when the muscle is passively stretched. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this spastic muscle tone remain obscure. Three major causes are currently considered possible: (1) changes in the excitability of spinal interneurones; (2) receptor hypersensitivity; (3) formation of new synapses by sprouting. The latter mechanism could account for the long time course over which spastic muscle tone develops in hemiplegic or paraplegic patients, but there is no experimental evidence for this hypothesis. The electromyographic (EMG) gait analysis of patients with spasticity has thrown doubt on the common belief that the velocity-dependent increase in spastic muscle tone is evoked by stretch reflex activity and has led to the idea that spastic muscle tone resides in the muscle fibres themselves. While such a mechanism may contribute to the slowness of active movements in spastic patients, recent experiments on patients with spastic arm paresis have confirmed the classical view that the spastic muscle tone is related to the EMG activity evoked in the passively stretched muscle. This pathological EMG activity is seen during the entire range of the dynamic phase of the stretch, during which a normal muscle exhibits only an early, phasic burst at the highest stretch velocities employed. For the pharmacological treatment of spasticity, substances with different central or peripheral actions are available. Their assumed receptor actions are described, together with their main indications and side-effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Characteristic, suggestive and unspecific features were identified. Six characteristic features proved most valuable for diagnosis of psychogenesis, as they occurred alone or in combination in 97% of patients: (1) momentary fluctuations of stance and gait, often in response to suggestion; (2) excessive slowness or hesitation of locomotion incompatible with neurological disease; (3) \"psychogenic\" Romberg test with a build-up of sway amplitudes after a silent latency or with improvement by distraction; (4) uneconomic postures with wastage of muscular energy; (5) the \"walking on ice\" gait pattern, which is characterized by small cautious steps with fixed ankle joints; (6) sudden buckling of the knees, usually without falls. Seventy-three percent of patients had additional suggestive features. Classification into characteristic subtypes was not found useful because predominant features varied from patient to patient and occurred in various combinations. Factitious impairment of stance and gait was studied in 13 healthy drama students. Simulated gait dysfunction appeared less conspicuous and more difficult to diagnose than the clinical psychogenic disorders.\r"

In families B and C one member has \"typical\" FD, and another has a similar ataxic syndrome, except for preservation of knee jerks. Laboratory evaluation is consistent with the diagnosis of FD in all cases. FD diagnosis appears justified in secondary cases with late onset or preserved tendon reflexes, provided that the index case fulfils all diagnostic criteria. Whether the diagnosis of FD is tenable in sporadic \"atypical\" cases remains to be seen. Echocardiographic and neurophysiological examination may be valuable in classifying such cases.\r"

  ".U": "91332583\r", 
  ".W": "The frequency and degree of stiatopallidonigral (SPN) degeneration were examined in 41 autopsy cases of Pick's disease. Based on the degree of SPN degeneration, these cases were arranged into four groups: 1) group I (severely degenerate; 19.5%), 2) group II (moderately degenerate; 22.0%), 3) group III (mildly degenerate; 36.5%), and 4) group IV (non-degenerate; 22.0%). 17 of the 41 cases had a definite (moderate to severe) SPN degeneration. The striatum, especially the caudate nucleus, was most frequently and most severely affected, while the internal segment of the globus pallidus was least frequently and least severely affected. In general, the oral portions of the SPN nuclei were more severely involved. In addition, in the putamen and globus pallidus the dorsomedial portions adjacent to the internal capsule were apt to be affected more markedly than the other portions. In the substantia nigra the degeneration tended to be more predominant in the pars reticulata than in the pars compacta, although both were usually involved. In addition, the medial to central portions of the substantia nigra were more vulnerable. In comparing the severely and moderately degenerate groups (groups I and II) with the mildly and non degenerate groups (groups III and IV), the former had more female cases, longer duration of illness, and more third-stage cases. In addition, the former contained more cases with lower brain weight and (predominant) frontal atrophy type, and more atypical cases without Pick bodies, or with symmetrical pyramidal tract degeneration or with combined traumatic lesions. It is notable that in all cases with definite SPN degeneration no extrapyramidal involuntary movements had been detected.\r"

Both pre- and postoperative SEPs were recorded in three of four epileptic patients. There were no significant differences in the latencies and amplitudes of the bilateral frontal components (P20, N26) between pre- and postoperative recordings. Furthermore, irrespective of the extent of the section or lesion in the corpus callosum, the nature of the impairment and the existence of the disconnection syndrome, the SEP findings showed no significant differences compared with those of normal subjects. It thus appears unlikely that the ipsilateral SEP responses are transmitted from the contralateral hemisphere through at least the anterior portion of the corpus callosum.\r"

In specimens from patients suffering from only polymyalgia rheumatica there was unexpected evidence of classic complement and lytic complex activation.

  ".U": "91332652\r", 
  ".W": "The upper thoracic vertebrae are difficult to approach surgically because of the narrowing of the thoracic inlet, the proximity of the brachial plexus, and the parascapular shoulder musculature. A novel lateral parascapular extrapleural approach to the upper thoracic vertebrae is described. The parascapular shoulder musculature (trapezius, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles) is reflected off the spinous processes to the scapula as a musculocutaneous flap, preserving the neurovascular supply. The paraspinal musculature is mobilized and retracted, and the upper dorsal ribs are removed with caution to avoid injury to the C-8 and T-1 nerve roots. The rami communicantes are transected, and the sympathetic chain is displaced anterolaterally. The T2-4 vertebrae can be approached unobstructed. The T-1 nerve root obstructs posterolateral access to the T-1 vertebra, necessitating an inferolateral approach underneath the T-1 nerve root axilla. Four patients with compressive myelopathy from upper thoracic vertebral metastases underwent neural decompression, vertebral reconstruction, and posterior spinal fixation with this approach. Their postoperative neurological status was either unchanged or improved. Complications included radiographic pleural effusion and superficial wound dehiscence; one patient required posterior spinal reinstrumentation for progressive kyphosis. One patient developed pneumonia 7 days postoperatively which was unresponsive to appropriate treatment. It is believed that the anatomical limitations to this region have been overcome, and that excellent exposure of the T1-4 vertebrae for neural decompression and vertebral reconstruction can be performed safely. A major advantage is that posterior spinal fixation can be carried out simultaneously.\r"

  ".W": "Intracranial aneurysms are an unusual complication of sickle-cell anemia; only 15 patients have been described in the world literature. An additional 15 patients with sickle-cell anemia and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured intracranial aneurysms are presented. There was a high incidence of multiple aneurysms (60%); some of which were in unusual locations. The clinical and pathological features of this series of patients have provided a paradigm for acquired aneurysm formation that may be applicable to other intracranial aneurysms. Thirteen patients underwent craniotomy and clip ligation; the perioperative management of these patients is discussed. Of these 13, eight had a good recovery, three were left with moderate disability, one patient died of surgical complications, and one died of complications related to sickle-cell anemia. Two of the 15 patients died of SAH. The authors propose that endothelial injury from the abnormal adherence of sickle erythrocytes to the endothelium is the initiating event in arterial wall injury. Subsequently, there is fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina and degeneration of the smooth-muscle layer. Hemodynamic stress at these loci of arterial wall damage results in aneurysm formation. This hypothesis also explains other cerebrovascular manifestations of sickle-cell anemia, namely vaso-occlusive disease and hemorrhage without aneurysm formation. Pathological material from this series and data from the literature are presented to support this hypothesis.\r"

  ".W": "The authors present their review of 178 patients who underwent en bloc temporal lobectomies as surgical treatment for intractable epilepsy. Hippocampal cell density was quantitatively analyzed and the histology of the anterior temporal lobe was reviewed. Fifty-four patients (30.3%) had evidence of extrahippocampal lesions in addition to neuronal cell loss within the hippocampus (the dual pathology group). The pattern of cell loss was analyzed in the remaining 124 cases (69.7%) with no extrahippocampal pathology, and compared with that of the dual pathology group and a control group of four nonepileptic patients. Hippocampal cell loss was found in almost all epileptic patients compared to the control group. Severe cell loss greater than 30% of control values was found in 88.7% of patients without extrahippocampal lesions, but in only 51.8% of patients with dual pathology. The difference between these two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). In the dual pathology group, lesions of different pathology had a significant relationship with the degree of hippocampal cell loss: all 12 patients with glioma had mild cell loss, whereas all 13 patients with heterotopia were associated with severe cell loss. Severity of hippocampal cell loss was also analyzed in relation to seizure history: a prior severe head injury was associated with severe cell loss. Other factors such as seizure duration, secondary generalization, or family history of seizures were not associated with hippocampal damage. Dual pathology may produce a combination of neocortical and temporolimbic epilepsies that warrants a precise definition of the true epileptogenic area prior to surgical treatment.\r"

Although all patients ultimately suffered a recurrence, those with lumbosacral tumors treated with surgery and irradiation had a longer mean disease-free survival period (6.6 years) than those treated with surgery alone (4.1 years) (p = 0.08). Disease-free survival times of patients with base of the skull tumors was not significantly different between the treatment groups. Irradiation after resection of chordomas appears to increase the time to first relapse in lumbosacral tumors and should be considered after subtotal resection.\r"

The results demonstrated that the control group had significantly higher scores than the patients with closed head injury on all WAIS-R and WMS-R index scores. Further analysis revealed that the patients with closed head injury showed a greater impairment in delayed memory when directly compared to intellectual performance that was not seen in the control group. These results are discussed in relation to findings in patients with more severe closed head injury, the construction of the WAIS-R and the WMS-R, and the performance patterns of the two groups.\r"

These patients were treated over a 1-year period and reflect an evolving insight into the treatment of thoracic and lumbar spine trauma with universal instrumentation. The TSRH instrumentation system appears equivalent to the more established Cotrel-Dubousset system in most respects. The construct design of the TSRH system facilitates the safe application of a rigid spinal implant. No cases of instability or pseudoarthrosis were observed during an average follow-up period of 9 months, (minimum 3 months). As the surgical treatment plan evolved, shorter and more compact constructs were increasingly utilized. There were no cases of instrumentation failure, regardless of the number of spinal levels fused or the number of levels instrumented. The value of using short rods when possible is emphasized: they may decrease the incidence of delayed instability and discomfort related to loosening at the hook/bone interface compared to that observed when long-rod systems are used in association with short spine fusions causing a fusion/instrumentation mismatch.\r"

The mean follow-up period was 36 months. There were 32 patients who had compression of the seventh cranial nerve ventrocaudally by an anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) or a posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Of these 32 patients, 30 (94%) had excellent postoperative results. Of 14 patients with more severe compression by the vertebral artery, nine (64%) had excellent results, three (21%) had good results, and two (14%) had poor results; in this group, three patients with excellent results experienced transient spasm recurrence. There were seven patients in whom the meatal branch of the AICA coursed between the seventh and eighth cranial nerves and compressed the dorsal aspect of the seventh nerve; this was usually associated with another artery compressing the ventral aspect of the nerve (\"sandwich-type\" compression). Of these seven patients, five (71%) had poor results including operative failure in one and recurrence of spasm in four. The authors conclude that the clinical outcome was closely related to the patterns of vascular compression.\r"

  ".W": "The authors report their experience using dorsal longitudinal myelotomy in treating spasticity in 20 patients with complete spinal cord injuries. These patients suffered from severe painful flexor/extensor spasms that prevented them from wheelchair ambulation and/or their decubitus ulcers healing. All were receiving large doses of various oral drugs, including baclofen, which had failed to control their spasticity, and all underwent a modification of a posterior T-myelotomy as first described by Bischof. All 20 patients enjoyed immediate complete relief of their painful spasms, although two (10%) eventually experienced return of their spasms and are thus classified as long-term failures. Seventeen patients succeeded in markedly reducing, or being completely weaned from, their antispasmodic medications. In 11 of 14 patients, nonhealing decubitus ulcers subsequently healed with treatment. Bladder function was unchanged from the preoperative status in all patients. Chronic intrathecal baclofen infusion has recently been reported as an effective treatment of the spasticity of paraplegia. The results of this study, along with previous reports advocating dorsal longitudinal myelotomy, suggest that this approach is an efficacious alternative to chronic baclofen infusion in reducing spasticity for complete paraplegics. Considering the cost of the infusion pump, along with the fact that chronic intrathecal baclofen therapy necessitates long-term medical supervision, it appears that myelotomy is superior for this select group of patients who have no hope of regaining voluntary motor function.\r"

  ".U": "91332662\r", 
  ".W": "Epidural spinal cord stimulation by means of chronically implanted electrodes was carried out on 121 patients with pain of varied benign organic etiology. In 116 patients, the pain was confined to the back and lower extremities and, of these, 56 exhibited the failed-back syndrome. Most patients were referred by a pain management service because of failure of conventional pain treatment modalities. Electrodes were implanted at varying sites, dictated by the location of pain. A total of 140 epidural implants were used: 76 unipolar, 46 Resume electrodes, 12 bipolar, and six quadripolar. Patients were followed for periods ranging from 6 months to 10 years, with a mean follow-up period of 40 months. Forty-eight patients (40%) were able to control their pain by neurostimulation alone. A further 14 patients (12%), in addition to following a regular stimulation program, needed occasional analgesic supplements to achieve 50% or more relief of the prestimulation pain. Pain secondary to arachnoiditis or perineural fibrosis following multiple intervertebral disc operations, when predominantly confined to one lower extremity, seemed to respond favorably to this treatment. Uniformly good results were also obtained in lower-extremity pain secondary to multiple sclerosis. Pain due to advanced peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs was well controlled, and amputation below the knee was delayed for up to 2 years in some patients. Pain due to cauda equina injury, paraplegic pain, phantom-limb pain, pure midline back pain without radiculopathy, or pain due to primary bone or joint disease seemed to respond less well. Patients who responded to preliminary transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation generally did well with electrode implants. Notable complications included wound infection, electrode displacement or fracturing, and fibrosis at the stimulating tip of the electrode. Three patients in this series died due to unrelated causes. Epidural spinal cord stimulation has proven to be an effective and safe means of controlling pain on a long-term basis in selected groups of patients. The mechanism of action of stimulation-produced analgesia remains unclear; further studies to elucidate it might allow spinal cord stimulation to be exploited more effectively in disorders that are currently refractory to this treatment modality.\r"

Forty anesthetized rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups of 10 rats each: a control group (Group C): a group with induction of hemorrhage at 16.2 ml/kg/10 min (Group H); a group with fluid-percussion brain injury at a peak pressure of 1.7 atm and an impulse duration of 25 msec (Group T); and a group receiving hemorrhagic shock following brain trauma (Group TH). Group C and T rats showed no significant alterations in cardiovascular function. At the end of hemorrhage there were no significant differences between Groups TH and H in the nadirs of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) (mean values +/- standard error of the mean: 42 +/- 2 vs. 40 +/- 4 mm Hg) and stroke volume index (SVI) (0.61 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.10 ml/bt/kg); however, 1 hour post-hemorrhage recovery was blunted in Group TH compared to Group H (MABP 56 +/- 4 vs. 65 +/- 3 mm Hg; cardiac index 182 +/- 15 vs. 220 +/- 15 ml/min/kg; and SVI 0.71 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.06 ml/bt/kg). Since the two groups showed no significant differences in heart rate, preload (central venous pressure), and afterload (systemic vascular resistance), the reduced cardiac index recovery in Group TH is believed due to the attenuation of cardiac contractile performance. The Group TH preparation potentiated hormonal responses to hemorrhage with significantly higher epinephrine and aldosterone levels than in Group H. Brain trauma enhanced the norepinephrine response to hemorrhage, even at an injury level that by itself did not result in an increase in this hormone. Group TH rats also had significantly lower blood pH and HCO3 levels. The data suggest that brain trauma suppresses MABP and cardiac index recovery after hemorrhage mainly by inhibiting cardiac contractile performance, probably due to high catecholamine levels and severe metabolic acidosis.\r"

Forty cynomolgus monkeys were randomly assigned to one of five groups. On Day 0, each animal underwent angiography followed by right craniectomy and placement of an Ommaya reservoir with its catheter adjacent to the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). The animals received intrathecal injections twice a day for 6 days of one of the following solutions: mock cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); OxyHb; MetHb; bilirubin; or supernatant fluid from an incubated mixture of autologous blood and mock CSF. On Day 7, angiography was repeated and the animals were killed. Comparison of angiograms obtained on Day 0 and Day 7 of the experiment showed significant vasospasm of the right MCA and the right anterior cerebral and internal carotid arteries in the animal groups that had received OxyHb or supernatant fluid. There was a smaller reduction in diameter of the same vessels in the bilirubin group (not statistically significant), while no effects were observed in the groups receiving MetHb or mock CSF. Electron microscopy of the right MCA's gave results consistent with the angiographic findings. One monkey in the OxyHb group developed a delayed-onset right MCA infarction. These data suggest that OxyHb is the cause of cerebral vasospasm following SAH.\r"

One theory is that arterial narrowing is exacerbated by surgical manipulation of vasospastic vessels during aneurysm dissection and clipping. This theory was tested in a primate model of cerebral vasospasm and the results reported. Six monkeys underwent baseline cerebral angiography, followed by induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on both sides of the circle of Willis. An equal amount of fresh autologous blood clot was placed around each internal carotid, anterior cerebral, and middle cerebral artery. Six days later, angiography was repeated and the right craniectomy was reopened for clot evacuation and surgical manipulation of the right cerebral arteries, including placement of a temporary aneurysm clip on the right middle cerebral artery. The left cerebral arteries were not exposed or manipulated, and served as controls. Twenty-four hours later angiography was repeated, then the animals were killed. Equal and significant vasospasm (greater than 40% reduction in vessel caliber compared to baseline, p less than 0.05) was seen in the middle cerebral arteries on both sides of the circle of Willis in all animals 6 and 7 days after SAH. There was no significant change in the severity of vasospasm on Day 7 compared with Day 6 in the right cerebral arteries. Increased risk of postoperative cerebral ischemia for surgery in the peak vasospasm period may be due to mechanisms other than increased arterial narrowing precipitated by surgical manipulation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of hypothermia and hyperthermia on the cerebral microcirculation were studied using isolated perfused intracerebral (parenchymal) arterioles obtained from rats. In a temperature-dependent manner, hypothermia (20.0 degrees to 35.0 degrees C) dilated the spontaneous tone developed by the arterioles and also diminished their contractile response to potassium and prostaglandin F2 alpha. In contrast, hyperthermia (40.0 degrees to 45.0 degrees C) induced a biphasic response consisting of initial vasoconstriction and secondary vasodilation. Exposure of the vessels to 45.0 degrees C for 30 minutes irreversibly abolished the spontaneous tone and responsiveness of the arterioles when the temperature of the preparation was returned to 37.5 degrees C. In calcium-free solutions, however, the arteriolar diameter was not affected within a temperature range of 20.0 degrees to 45 degrees C. Furthermore, arterioles that had been in a calcium-free solution during exposure to 45 degrees C temperature recovered their viability at 37.5 degrees C. These results suggest that changes in ambient temperature alter calcium-induced contraction in arteriolar smooth muscle, and that the irreversible effects of hyperthermia on the arterioles are dependent upon extracellular calcium. These studies indicate that alterations in brain temperature may affect the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia by mechanisms that are in part independent of parenchymal metabolism.\r"

After exposure of both sciatic nerves in each animal, baseline evoked nerve action potentials, muscle action potentials, and muscle strength values were determined for the posterior tibial nerves. Each nerve was then crushed over a measured distance. Three weeks later, the crushed segments were resected and the defects repaired with sural nerve grafts. In seven animals, 20-mm resection sites were repaired by 4 x 20-mm grafts in one leg and by 4 x 40-mm grafts contralaterally. In the other seven animals, the lengths of resection sites were 10 mm in one leg and 30 mm contralaterally; both nerve defects in these animals were repaired by 4 x 30-mm grafts. Electrophysiological studies were repeated at one interval of either 4, 7, or 12 months after repair. Postoperative electrophysiological values were compared to baseline values and described by the mean values and by percent recovery. Muscle strength recovery was significantly better in limbs with short lesions. In animals with identical lesion lengths, lesions repaired with shorter grafts (the same length as the defect) did significantly worse than did lesions repaired with longer grafts. This may suggest that any degree of tension at the graft repair site has a deleterious effect on functional nerve regeneration. Nevertheless, it was generally found that nerve lesion length had the greatest negative effect on functional nerve regeneration.\r"

Results were normalized to the mRNA expression of tubulin, a \"housekeeping\" gene present in glial cells. Of the 15 explants tested, PDGFB was seen in six, all of which were malignant tumors; PDGFA was seen in all 15 with much higher levels expressed in malignant tumors; and TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 were seen in all 15 without a clear difference between cell types, although expression tended to be higher in malignant tumors. This project supports the theory that the induction and maintenance of glial tumors is likely to be a multifactorial phenomenon.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on cytosolic free calcium in cultured rat vascular smooth-muscle cells using the fluorescent intracellular calcium indicator fura-2/AM. Samples of CSF were collected from 12 patients (seven with and five without vasospasm) on Days 2, 6, 11, and 16 after SAH. Control CSF samples were obtained from five patients 6 to 9 months after they had undergone successful aneurysm surgery following an SAH. All CSF samples in both the non-vasospasm and vasospasm groups, regardless of the day of sampling after the SAH, induced significantly higher transient intracellular calcium elevations when compared to levels induced by control CSF. Furthermore, the addition of 2 mM ethyleneglycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA) caused a slight reduction in the peak height in the CSF-induced intracellular calcium rise which declined more rapidly to basal levels than those studied without EGTA. In the non-vasospasm group, the intracellular calcium concentration remained stable after SAH throughout the study period. In contrast, in the vasospasm group, this concentration was highest on Day 2 post-SAH, but sharply decreased on Day 6 and rose again on Day 11. This result correlated with the clinical signs of vasospasm in these patients. These findings indicated that the intracellular calcium elevations induced by CSF obtained after SAH were due to the combination of the influx of extracellular calcium and the mobilization of intracellular calcium from storage sites. The changes in intracellular calcium concentrations in vascular smooth-muscle cells induced by CSF obtained from patients on successive days following SAH suggest that the substances that induce this repeat calcium elevation on Day 11 post-SAH may be the key spasmogens for vasospasm after SAH.\r"

After craniotomy and clipping the patient made a satisfactory recovery. This is the only reported case of a traumatic aneurysm arising under circumstances not usually considered as trauma. It raises questions about the pathophysiology of the formation of such aneurysms and suggests that traumatic pericallosal aneurysms should be considered in SAH of unknown etiology. This case provides further evidence that repeat angiography occasionally helps reveal an aneurysm when the initial study fails to do so.\r"

Rigid posterior fixation and complete reduction of the dislocation were achieved using an anatomically contoured steel loop secured to the occiput and cervical vertebrae. The addition of cancellous bone to the graft afforded long-term stability. This operative treatment provided anatomical realignment of the dislocation and allowed early mobilization of the patient with the use of aggressive rehabilitation. Previously reported cases of patients surviving anterior atlanto-occipital dislocation are reviewed. The use of cervical traction, halo bracing, and operative stabilization is discussed.\r"

Although prognosis and treatment differ depending on etiology, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are usually unrevealing in early HIV encephalopathy and therefore cannot differentiate it from psychogenic conditions. Thirty of 32 patients (94%) with HIV encephalopathy had single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) findings that differed from the findings in 15 patients with non-HIV psychoses and 6 controls. SPECT showed multifocal cortical and subcortical areas of hypoperfusion. In 4 cases, cognitive improvement after 6-8 weeks of zidovudine (AZT) therapy was reflected in amelioration of SPECT findings. CT remained unchanged. SPECT may be a useful technique for the evaluation of HIV encephalopathy.\r"

T2-weighted axial magnetic resonance images and transaxial 99mTc-HMPAO and 201Tl images acquired with an annular gamma camera were merged using an objective registration (translation, rotation and rescaling) program. In the normal subjects and patients with dementia and focal lesions, focal areas of high uptake corresponded to gray matter structures. Focal lesions observed on MRI corresponded to perfusion defects on SPECT. In the patients who had undergone surgical resection of glioblastoma followed by interstitial brachytherapy, increased 201Tl corresponding to recurrent tumor could be localized from the superimposed images. The method was evaluated by measuring the residuals in all subjects and translational errors due to superimposition of deep structures in the 12 subjects with normal thalamic anatomy and 99mTc-HMPAO uptake. This method for superimposing magnetic resonance and high-resolution SPECT images of the brain is a useful technique for correlating regional function with brain anatomy.\r"

Five normals, 15 patients with prior myocardial infarction, 5 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 3 with dilated cardiomyopathy were studied. The systolic thickening ratio was calculated as [(end-systolic--end-diastolic pixel counts) divided by end-diastolic pixel counts], using the circumferential profile technique of both end-diastolic and end-systolic short axial images. Functional images of the systolic thickening ratio were also displayed with the \"bull's-eye\" method. The mean systolic thickening ratio thus calculated were as follows: normals, 0.53 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- 1 s.d.); non-transmural prior myocardial infarction, 0.33 +/- 0.09; transmural prior myocardial infarction, 0.14 +/- 0.05; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in relatively nonhypertrophied areas, 0.56 +/- 0.11; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in hypertrophied areas, 0.23 +/- 0.07; and dilated cardiomyopathy, 0.19 +/- 0.02. The systolic thickening ratio analysis by gated thallium SPECT offers a unique approach for assessing LV function.\r"

Arterial sampling of 99mTc-HMPAO was performed on each subject over a 25-min period postinjection. The lipophilic fraction of the tracer present in the blood was rapidly extracted with octanol. An analysis of the time course of the extracted and nonextracted octanol fractions was performed in order to calculate the arterial input of the tracer available for brain extraction. HMPAO net regional brain clearances were then calculated and compared with rCBF values obtained in the same patients using 99mTc-microspheres injected into the left ventricle of the heart. HMPAO brain clearances were 0.41 +/- 0.01 and 0.27 +/- 0.01 ml/min/g for grey and white matter, respectively. Linear regression analysis was performed and the following result was obtained: clearance (HMPAO) = 0.07 + 0.43 . rCBF with a high significance (p less than 0.001). This equation can be used for the transformation of HMPAO clearances into rCBF values. Our study demonstrates that by using HMPAO and SPECT it is possible to obtain a quantitative estimate of rCBF in humans.\r"

There were 6 benign lesions and 19 malignant lesions of various grades. A high correlation (Rho = 0.83) was found between the normalized uptake of tracer and the NCl grade. The high-grade malignancies had significantly greater (p = 0.0091) uptake of FDG than the combination of benign lesions and low-grade malignancies. All lesions with a normalized uptake value of 1.6 or greater were high-grade, while all lesions less than 1.6 represented either benign tumors or low grade malignancies. This strong relationship between FDG uptake and grade among neoplasms from a wide variety of cell types within a single organ system suggests that the technique may be useful in predicting grade even when the cell type is unknown.\r"

The heart sound gating (HSG) circuitry identifies, individually, both the first (S1) and second (S2) heart sounds from their timing relationship alone, and provides two trigger points during the cardiac cycle. First heart sound gating may be performed to assess the systolic ejection portion of the cardiac cycle, with S2 gating utilized for reproduction of the diastolic filling portion of the cycle. Heart sound gating has been applied to twenty patients who underwent analysis of left ventricular function, and compared to conventional ECG-gated MGBP. Left ventricular ejection fractions calculated from MGBP studies using a first and a second heart sound trigger correlated well with conventional ECG gated acquisitions in patients adequately gated by HSG and ECG. Heart sound gating may be utilized in patients with rapidly changing heart rates, as S1 and S2 precisely define end-diastole and end-systole, respectively, and in situations when the ECG is inadequate for gating purposes.\r"

Glucose-loaded studies had better image quality, diminished FDG blood-pool activity, and were more often clinically interpretable compared to fasted studies. Dietary state did not affect 13N-ammonia study parameters. Using a semi-quantitative region of interest method, 18FDG myocardial activity was homogeneous and significantly affected by dietary state (2.48 +/- 1.0 fold increase in myocardial-to-blood pool ratio in glucose-loaded versus fasted states). Serum glucose, insulin, and free-fatty acid concentrations responded physiologically to glucose loading and fasting but showed no correlation with myocardial 18FDG uptake. PET imaging using 13N-ammonia and 18FDG appears optimal in the glucose-loaded state.\r"

  ".W": "The positron-emitting estrogenic steroid 16 alpha-[18F]fluoro-17 beta-estradiol (FES) has been shown to exhibit selective uptake in primary breast carcinomas; the uptake of tracer by positron emission tomography (PET) is strongly correlated with the tumor estrogen-receptor concentration. We have now extended the use of this radiopharmaceutical for imaging of metastases of breast carcinoma by PET in 16 patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. Increased uptake of FES was identified on PET images in 53 of 57 metastatic lesions (93%); only two apparent false-positive foci of FES uptake were seen. In seven of the patients, evaluable PET studies were obtained both before and after initiation of antiestrogen therapy. In all cases, there was a decrease in FES uptake in the tumor deposits after initiation of antiestrogen therapy, and the mean (+/- standard deviation) uptake decreased from 2.22 (+/- 1.23) to 0.80 (+/- 0.42) x 10(3)+ dose/ml. These results indicate that PET with FES has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting metastatic breast carcinoma and provide additional confirmatory evidence that the tumor uptake of this ligand is a receptor-mediated process.\r"

In vitro binding and in vivo tissue distribution studies in rats have shown that FENP has high specific activity, high affinity for progestin receptors, and receptor-mediated uptake in target tissues. Eight patients with primary breast carcinoma were studied. Breast carcinoma was identified correctly in 50% of the patients with progestin-receptor-positive tumors; however, the FENP uptake was not correlated with progestin-receptor levels. We noted a low target-to-background ratio in humans, with high relative activity in the spine, blood pool, and normal breast tissue. Our findings indicate that FENP is not a suitable agent for imaging progestin receptors in humans.\r"

We evaluated the effect of caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, on the diagnostic results of dipyridamole-201Tl myocardial imaging in eight patients with coronary artery disease. Caffeine infusion significantly attenuated the dipyridamole-induced fall in blood pressure and the accompanied increase in heart rate. The infusion of dipyridamole alone resulted in chest pain and ST-segment depressions on the electrocardiogram in four patients, whereas none of these problems occurred when the tests were repeated after caffeine. In six of eight patients, caffeine was responsible for false-negative dipyridamole-201Tl tests. Semiquantitive scores of the dipyridamole-induced 201Tl perfusion defects were decreased by caffeine from 9.0 +/- 0.9 to 2.0 +/- 1.1 points (p less than 0.05). Computerized analysis revealed a caffeine-mediated reduction in the percent reversibility of the images from 46% +/- 16% to 6% +/- 10% (p less than 0.05). We conclude that the use of caffeinated products prior to dipyridamole-201Tl testing may be responsible for false-negative findings.\r"

A possible pathophysiologic mechanism to explain these scan appearances is asymptomatic segmental graft infarction secondary to progressive vascular disease.

Excretion was judged normal if images subsequent to the 15-min image showed a subjectively normal rate of decreasing parenchymal intensity. Biopsies were graded subjectively for hepatocyte damage and for findings of cholestasis. Uptake criteria were successful in differentiating high from low hepatocyte damage scores (p less than 0.0001), and excretion criteria were successful in differentiating high from low cholestasis scores (p = 0.002), while uptake criteria were not capable of differentiating high from low cholestasis scores, nor were excretion criteria capable of differentiating high from low hepatocyte damage scores (p's greater than 0.05). These results suggest that scintigraphy can distinguish intrahepatic cholestasis from pure hepatocyte damage.\r"

Forty-two patients with histologically proven squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck and four patients with metastases of head and neck tumors were examined with PET and FDG prior to surgery. In 35 of these patients, a flow cytometric analysis of the DNA content and the proliferation rate was done using one-dimensional flow cytometry rate was done using one-dimensional flow cytometry (DAPI staining). In 17 cases, perfusion studies with 15O-labeled water were performed. Twenty-seven specimens were evaluable by flow cytometry. The analysis of the distribution of the FDG uptake revealed two groups, showing a high and a lower uptake pattern. In both groups the FDG uptake and the proliferation rate were correlated with an r-value of 0.64 and 0.8 respectively. However, the slope of the regression function was flat. No correlation was found between the perfusion and the proliferation rate. It is suggested that these differences in uptake in histologically identical tumor populations may correspond to differences at the molecular level, e.g., differences in the amount of the glucose carrier, perhaps caused by oncogenic transformation.\r"

Heart-to-lung, heart-to-liver, and heart-to-adjacent infradiaphragmatic activity ratios were generated from anterior images acquired immediately following the test. Additionally, heart-to-total infradiaphragmatic activity was graded semiquantitatively. Results showed a significantly higher ratio of heart to subdiaphragmatic activity in the treadmill group as compared with dipyridamole alone (p less than 0.001) and dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip exercise (p less than 0.001). No significant difference was observed between patients receiving the dipyridamole infusion, and dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip exercise. We conclude that low-level treadmill exercise supplementation of dipyridamole infusion is an effective means of improving image quality. Supplementation with isometric handgrip does not improve image quality over dipyridamole alone.\r"

  ".W": "The substitution of intravenous dipyridamole for symptom-limited treadmill exercise has provided a non-invasive means to diagnose coronary artery disease with 201Tl scintigraphy in patients unable to adequately exercise. Limitations of dipyridamole/thallium imaging are primarily due to suboptimal image quality secondary to hepatic tracer concentration and decreased test sensitivity in patients who are dipyridamole \"non-responders.\" Low-level treadmill exercise supplementation improves image quality, whereas handgrip has little, if any, benefit. The effect of low-level exercise in augmenting coronary blood flow is unknown and reports regarding the effect of handgrip are conflicting. The diagnostic benefit of these maneuvers in improving test sensitivity and decreasing the number of \"non-responders\" has not been documented. The combination of maximal, symptom-limited treadmill exercise and intravenous dipyridamole is a theoretically attractive option to improve overall test sensitivity, but the physiologic consequences and potential side effects should be more thoroughly investigated.\r"

We have found that in normal dogs cocaine induces severe temporary hypoperfusion of the left ventricle as indicated by a significantly lower 201Tl concentration compared to the baseline state. The most significant decrease in uptake occurred 5 min after injection and was more pronounced in the septal and apical segments. Following intravenous administration of cocaine, instead of gradual disappearance of 201Tl from the left ventricle, there was continuous increase in 201Tl concentration in the left ventricle. These imaging experiments indicate that the deleterious effects of cocaine on the heart are probably due to spasm of the coronaries and decreased myocardial perfusion. Since spasm of the large subpericardial vessels does not seem to explain the magnitude of the increased coronary resistance and decreased coronary flow after cocaine as described in the literature, it is suggested that microvascular spasm of smaller vessels plays a major role in the temporary decrease in perfusion. The data may also suggest that severe temporary myocardial ischemia is probably the initiating factor for the cardiac complications induced by cocaine.\r"

Tumor uptake showed the highest values of all analyzed tissues from 6 to 24 hr after injection. High uptake in melanotic tumor tissue with relatively low uptake in blood, muscle, brain, lung, and liver tissue resulted in high tumor/nontumor ratios (at 24 hr for B16, tumor/blood = 37, tumor/brain = 147, tumor/muscle = 95).

Images were processed using a 50% threshold and the size of the resulting perfusion defect was expressed as a fraction of total left ventricular image volume. The critically ischemic left ventricular fraction determined in vitro from the microsphere perfusion data, ranged from 5% to 30% of the total left ventricular weight and correlated closely with that determined noninvasively by PET with r = 0.94 (y = 1.05X - 2.0%).

Demonstration of saturation of the receptor with [125I]iodopride in striatum required uptake in frontal cortex to be used, rather than cerebellar uptake, to define nonspecific binding.

The essential features of the thallium scintigrams were marked counterclockwise rotation of the heart with perfusion abnormalities of the inferior wall and apex. Since patients with congenitally-corrected transposition of the great arteries may present with the symptom of chest pain, the diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries should be considered in patients with marked counterclockwise rotation of the heart and segmental perfusion abnormalities on thallium scintigraphy.\r"

Routine laboratory examination showed hypotonic hyponatremia, but was otherwise unremarkable. Brain mapping revealed a bifrontal delta focus, more pronounced on the right. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain with technetium-99m labeled d,l hexamethylpropylene-amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO), performed during the acute episode showed relative frontoparietal hypoactivity. Brain mapping performed after disappearance of the echolalia and palilalia, which persisted only for 1 day, was normal. By contrast, SPECT findings persisted for more than 3 wk. Features of particular interest in the presented patient are the extensive defects seen on brain SPECT despite the absence of morphologic lesions, the congruent electrophysiologic changes and their temporal relationship with the clinical evolution.\r"

  ".W": "This article describes the preparation of sn-1,2-[11C]diacylglycerols and sn-1,3-[11C]diacylglycerols by a no-carrier-added reaction based on a labeling method using [1-11C]propyl ketene, which is one of the most potent acylating agents. [1-11C]Propyl ketene was produced by pyrolytic decomposition of [1-11C]butyric acid and was trapped in pyridine containing L-alpha-palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine, producing L-alpha-palmitoyl-2-[1-11C]butyryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine. We adopted an enzymatic reaction to remove the phosphorylcholine, in which L-alpha-palmitoyl-2-[1-11C]butyryl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine was incubated with phospholipase C, hydrolyzing to produce 1-palmitoyl-sn-2-[1-11C]butyrylglycerol. Total synthesis time was about 50 minutes and the specific activity was estimated at 93 GBq/mumol (2.5 Ci/mumol) at end of synthesis. Radiochemical yield was 3.8% based on the trapped 11CO2. sn-1,3-[11C]Diacylglycerol was also synthesized by [1-11C]propyl ketene reaction with 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol in a single procedure. The regional brain tissue radioactivities obtained in sn-1,2-[11C]diacylglycerol were higher than those of sn-1,3-[11C]diacylglycerol, and the regional values varied widely. In autoradiography of brain slices from conscious rats, sn-1,2-[11C]diacylglycerol incorporation sites were discretely localized, especially in the amygdala, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus, suggesting that intensive neuronal processing occurred in these areas on the basis of phosphatidylinositol turnover.\r"

These carriers can subsequently be covalently linked to monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) using heterobifunctional linking agents. We describe here such a conjugate in which the MoAb (5E8) has specificity for a glycoprotein detected on human squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. We provide evidence that the conjugates produced were covalently linked and retained both their photosensitizing and antigen-binding activities. We show further that the MoAb-PVA-BPD conjugate, in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, exhibited highly enhanced phototoxic killing of the target cell line (A549) over that exhibited by free BPD or a control MoAb-PVA-BPD conjugate. These results demonstrate, therefore, both the selectivity and specificity of this MoAb conjugate.\r"

Information from a self-administered owner questionnaire and/or a telephone interview of about 491 cases, 466 nontumor controls, and 479 tumor controls indicated that owners in households with dogs that developed malignant lymphoma applied 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) herbicides to their lawn and/or employed commercial lawn care companies to treat their yard significantly more frequently than control owners (odds ratio = 1.3). In addition, the risk of canine malignant lymphoma rose to a twofold excess with four or more yearly owner applications of 2,4-D. The findings in this study are consistent with occupational studies in humans, which have reported modest associations between agricultural exposure to 2,4-D and increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the histology and epidemiology of which are similar to those of canine malignant lymphoma. The present study suggests that human health implications of 2,4-D exposure in the home environment should receive further investigation.\r"

  ".U": "91332938\r", 
  ".W": "We hypothesize that each cell in low-grade (Gleason grade 1-3) prostate cancer tissue is at risk of transformation into a cell which produces a high-grade (Gleason grade 4-5) clinical cancer after a short period of growth. As a consequence, the volume of low-grade, latent cancer tissue in the prostate glands of men at any age determines their incidence rate for high-grade, clinical cancer a few years later. Autopsy and incidence data for both white men and black men support this conclusion, with a tumor growth period of about 7 years. The transformation rate is similar for black men and for white men, about 0.024 high-grade cancers per year per cm3 of low-grade, latent cancer volume. Our hypothesis explains the infrequent occurrence of clinical cancer despite the high prevalence of latent cancer, the steep rise of clinical cancer incidence with age despite the slow rise of latent cancer prevalence with age, and the disparities in clinical cancer incidence among some populations despite their similar latent cancer prevalence. This hypothesis suggests that low-grade cancer volume is a critical determinant of clinical cancer risk.\r"

  ".U": "91332939\r", 
  ".W": "Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that the selective antitumor activity of fluorouracil (5-FU) is enhanced by agents which perturb certain intracellular nucleotide pools. We previously demonstrated that the combination of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), which depletes pyrimidine nucleotide pools, and 5-FU yielded a 43% response rate among 37 assessable patients with colorectal carcinoma. In preclinical tumor models, 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside (MMPR), an inhibitor of purine synthesis, elevates phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) pools and promotes the anabolism of 5-FU to fluorinated nucleotides. In vivo, the addition of MMPR enhances the therapeutic efficacy of PALA-5-FU. In a phase I trial, we sought to determine the optimal dose and schedule of MMPR in combination with PALA (250 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-FU (1300 mg/m2 by 24-hour infusion on day 2). MMPR (75-225 mg/m2) was given intravenously on day 1 to 27 patients with solid tumors (15 colorectal, seven breast, five other). Toxic effects were mild to moderate and included leukopenia, mucositis, nausea, or rash. Two of seven patients given MMPR at 225 mg/m2 had grade 3 diarrhea. PRPP was measured using a [14C]orotic acid 14CO2 release assay in tumor biopsy specimens obtained before and 12 hours and 24 hours after MMPR doses were given to 20 patients. The addition of MMPR elevated PRPP pools in human solid tumors. At 12 hours after treatment, two (50%) of four patients showed a twofold or greater elevation of PRPP at the MMPR dose level of 75 mg/m2; a similar elevation was observed in five (71%) of seven patients given 150 mg/m2 MMPR and in three (43%) of seven patients given 225 mg/m2 MMPR. At 24 hours after treatment, results for the respective dose levels of MMPR were two (33%) of six patients, one (20%) of five patients, and four (57%) of seven patients. Administration of the two highest MMPR dose levels appeared to result in a greater increase in tumor PRPP levels. However, toxicity was greater at the 225 mg/m2 dose level; therefore, the 150 mg/m2 dose level was favored. Tumor levels of PRPP decreased between 12 hours and 24 hours in nine (56%) of 16 patients. This time course indicates that MMPR should be administered at the beginning of the 24-hour infusion of 5-FU.\r"

C57BL/6 mice were immunized to partially purified B16 melanoma vaccine given alone or together with different dose levels of adjuvant, or with saline or adjuvant alone. Humoral response, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), in vitro cytotoxicity, and tumor-protective immunity to melanoma were measured following three biweekly immunizations. The adjuvant potentiated the antibody response to some, but not all, melanoma antigens in a dose-dependent fashion. The adjuvant also potentiated cellular immunity as measured by in vitro cytotoxicity assays. No potentiation of tumor-protective immunity was detected. In comparison to Freund's complete adjuvant, cell wall skeleton plus monophosphoryl lipid A (CWS:MPL) induced fewer cutaneous toxic effects and stronger antibody and DTH responses but resulted in no greater in vitro cytotoxicity or tumor-protective immunity. Thus, the adjuvant had a selective and dose-dependent effect on humoral responses to vaccine immunization but did not potentiate a tumor-protective immunity to B16 melanoma.\r"

We have developed a human anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody (105AD7) which binds at or very near to the binding site of mouse antitumor monoclonal antibody 791T/36. The 791T/36 antibody binds to a tumor-associated antigen (gp72) expressed on a number of human tumors, including colorectal and ovarian carcinomas and osteogenic sarcoma. This study shows that, in rats and mice, 105AD7 induces delayed-type hypersensitivity to human tumor cells bearing the gp72 antigen. Local transfer of delayed hypersensitivity was also demonstrated using lymphocytes from mice primed with 105AD7. These findings show that the human monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody 105AD7 is likely to induce cellular immune responses to tumors in cancer patients.\r"

  ".W": "One noteworthy finding for the 1990-1991 academic year is the increasing number of applicants to medical school, coupled with stabilization in the credentials of accepted applicants. This increase appears to be reversing the downward trend of the 1980s. The percentages of women and total minority students in the entering class increased from the previous year. The prevalence of instructional formats such as problem-based learning and computer-assisted instruction illustrates that medical schools are willing to experiment with educational innovation. A number of schools are in the process of curriculum review, which may lead to important changes. The financial support offered by private foundations interested in curriculum innovation, for some, will be an added stimulus for change. While the majority of medical schools continue to require that students take the examinations and the subject tests of the NBME, evaluation formats that test clinical skills are receiving increased attention. The number of schools using multiple station examinations (often with standardized patients) is rising. The impact of the new US Medical Licensing Examination on medical school curricula should be analyzed in the future. Although steady increases have been reported in the number of medical school faculty members, especially clinical faculty, there is little information about how these faculty members apportion their time between teaching, research, and patient care. The assumption is that the increases are primarily driven by medical schools' need to provide clinical services, which are a source of income. Another explanation for faculty increases could relate to the need for more faculty involvement in educational innovations such as problem-based learning and new methods of clinical skills evaluation, which are relatively more faculty-intensive. Continued monitoring of the growth in clinical faculty will be necessary, as will more careful analysis of how medical school faculty spend their time. Since medical school faculty who have heavy involvements in teaching frequently do not receive appropriate recognition or reward, it will also be interesting to examine the effectiveness of diverse incentives used by the schools to reward teaching faculty. An appropriate reward system for teaching is important if undergraduate medical education is to command a high priority in institutions awarding the doctor of medicine degree.\r"

Analysis of graduate medical education data shows that the number of residents increased by 34.9% from the academic years 1980-1981 to 1990-1991, while the number of graduate year 1 residents decreased by 2%. In the same decade, the proportion of women residents increased by 7.1%.

These data provide a cornerstone for education and manpower planning. Consistent with previous years, men who were enrolled in CAHEA-accredited allied health education programs for the 1989-1990 academic year were significantly more likely to be lost to attrition than were women. When compared with all other categories of race and ethnic origin, black students not of Hispanic origin showed a significantly higher attrition rate (25.4%), while students designated as Asian or Pacific Islander showed a significantly lower rate (13%). Congruent with attrition data documented in the literature, CAHEA attrition data show wide variances across 26 allied health occupations and within the three disciplinary groupings that comprise approximately 75% of all CAHEA-accredited programs. Attrition rates measured by the type of sponsoring institution range from 7.1% (academic health centers and medical schools) to 24.3% (vocational and technical schools). Programs sponsored by for-profit institutions and federal government-owned institutions report substantially higher attrition rates, 25.1% and 21.1%, respectively.\r"

One example was the Medical College of the State of South Carolina. It was consigned to oblivion in Flexner's plan, but survived. Dean Robert Wilson, MD, in his efforts to save his school, turned politician, enlisted the aid of the state's highly controversial governor, and initiated an effective lobbying campaign in the state legislature. The Council on Medical Education became involved unofficially in the person of its secretary, Nathan P. Colwell, MD. His presence in South Carolina was turned to advantage by Wilson and others and contributed substantially to the success of their efforts.\r"

The 5-year randomized, controlled trial was performed between 1974 and 1980. The subjects and their risk factors were reevaluated in 1985. Posttrial mortality follow-up was continued up to December 31, 1989. SETTING. Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland, and Second Department of Medicine, University of Helsinki. PARTICIPANTS. In all, 3490 business executives born during 1919 through 1934 participated in health checkups in the late 1960s. In 1974, 1222 of these men who were clinically healthy, but with CVD risk factors, were entered into the primary prevention trial; 612 were randomized to an intervention and 610 to a control group. INTERVENTIONS. During the 5-year trial, the subjects of the intervention group visited the investigators every fourth month. They were treated with intensive dietetic-hygienic measures and frequently with hypolipidemic (mainly clofibrate and/or probucol) and antihypertensive (mainly beta-blockers and/or diuretics) drugs. The control group was not treated by the investigators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Total mortality, cardiac mortality, mortality due to other causes. RESULTS. Total coronary heart disease risk was reduced by 46% in the intervention group as compared with the control group at end-trial. During 5 posttrial years, the risk factor and medication differences were largely leveled off between the groups. Between 1974 and 1989 the total number of deaths was 67 in the intervention group and 46 in the control group (relative risk [RR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 2.08; P = .048); there were 34 and 14 cardiac deaths (RR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.31 to 4.46; P = .001), two and four deaths due to other CVD (not significant), 13 and 21 deaths due to cancer (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.22; P = .15), and 13 and one deaths due to violence (RR, 13.0; 95% CI, 1.70 to 98.7; P = .002), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis of treatments in the intervention group did not explain the 15-year excess cardiac mortality. CONCLUSION. These unexpected results may not question multifactorial prevention as such but do support the need for research on the selection and interaction(s) of methods used in the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.\r"

SETTING. Statewide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. The progression of the epidemic was examined by analyzing trends in Lyme disease cases reported to the state surveillance system, town and county Lyme disease incidence rates, Lyme disease hospital discharge rates, and the distribution of Ixodes dammini ticks obtained from surveillance efforts and submitted for identification. MAIN RESULTS. The number of confirmed Lyme disease cases in New York has increased with concurrent increases in the number of hospital discharges. The number of counties endemic for Lyme disease increased from four to eight between 1985 and 1989. The number of counties with documented I dammini ticks increased from four in 1985 to 22 in 1989. Incidence of the disease also increased within known endemic counties. CONCLUSIONS. Tick surveillance indicated that the range of I dammini has expanded annually into areas up to 384 km from the original known endemic areas of Long Island, NY, and Connecticut. Cumulative data from human surveillance resources document both temporal increases and geographic expansion of the Lyme disease epidemic in New York.\r"

Reductions in runaways' sexual risk behaviors were evaluated in response to an intensive program to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). DESIGN. In a nonrandomized control trial, sexual risk behaviors among 78 runaways at one residential shelter who received up to 30 HIV/AIDS intervention sessions were compared with 67 runaways at a nonintervention shelter with sexual behaviors assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months. SETTING. Runaways were recruited from the only two publicly funded shelters in New York, NY. PARTICIPANTS. The runaways were aged 11 to 18 years, 64% female, and predominantly black or Hispanic. INTERVENTION. The intervention addressed general knowledge about HIV/AIDS, coping skills, access to health care and other resources, and individual barriers to safer sex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Consistent condom use, a high-risk pattern of sexual behavior, and sexual abstinence over a 3-month time frame were assessed. MAIN RESULTS. As the number of intervention sessions increased, runaways' reports of consistent condom use increased significantly (at 3 months, unique R2 = .06, P less than .05; at 6 months, unique R2 = .09, P less than .05), and their reports of engaging in a high-risk pattern of sexual behavior decreased significantly (at 3 months, unique R2 = .03, P = .06; at 6 months, unique R2 = .04, P less than .05). Abstinence did not change. CONCLUSIONS. The demonstrated effectiveness of the intensive HIV/AIDS program highlights the importance of enlarging the scope of most current HIV/AIDS prevention programs.\r"

To examine the association of the volume of fluid administered at 1 and 6 hours after presentation, with survival and the occurrence of the adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and persistent hypovolemia during the resuscitation of children with septic shock. SETTING AND PATIENTS. All pediatric patients with septic shock presenting to the emergency department over a 6-year period and having a pulmonary artery catheter inserted by 6 hours after presentation were identified. METHODS. Patients were analyzed together and in three groups based on fluid volume in the first hour: group 1, less than 20 mL/kg; group 2, 20 to 40 mL/kg; and group 3, more than 40 mL/kg. Adult respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed by the presence of alveolar infiltrates, hypoxemia, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or less. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema was diagnosed similarly, except the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was greater than 15 mm Hg. Hypovolemia was diagnosed by the presence of oliguria, hypotension, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 8 mm Hg or less 6 hours after presentation. RESULTS. We identified 34 patients (median age, 13.5 months). At 1 and 6 hours, respectively, group 1 (n = 14) received 11 +/- 6 and 71 +/- 29 mL/kg (mean +/- SD) of fluid; group 2 received 32 +/- 5 and 108 +/- 54 mL/kg of fluid; and group 3 received 69 +/- 19 and 117 +/- 29 mL/kg of fluid. Survival in group 3 (eight of nine patients) was significantly better than in group 1 (six of 14 patients) or group 2 (four of 11 patients). Adult respiratory distress syndrome developed in 11 patients (32%) and cardiogenic pulmonary edema developed in five patients (15%). Having adult respiratory distress syndrome was associated with increased mortality, but adult respiratory distress syndrome was not increased in any group. Similarly, cardiogenic pulmonary edema was not associated with the fluid volume received or with decreased survival. Hypovolemia occurred in six patients in group 1 and two patients in group 2; all eight subsequently died. CONCLUSION. Rapid fluid resuscitation in excess of 40 mL/kg in the first hour following emergency department presentation was associated with improved survival, decreased occurrence of persistent hypovolemia, and no increase in the risk of cardiogenic pulmonary edema or adult respiratory distress syndrome in this group of pediatric patients with septic shock.\r"

Despite strong opposition and impediments from certain quarters, involving considerable machinations and intrigue, the determination of interested medical leaders and sympathetic members of Congress triumphed in having this remarkable institution established on the campus of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. As a participant in many of the negotiations preceding that decision, I have happily witnessed the transformation of the Library, long housed in cramped, makeshift quarters, to its present magnificent structures in the heart of our nation's foremost medical research center. Its prodigious collection of print, audiovisual, and electronic information; its imaginative research projects; its excellent outreach program; and its innovative services and products are indispensable to all practicing health professionals, scientists, and medical educators, as well as to journalists, government officials, and others. The ultimate beneficiary, of course, is the patient.\r"

  ".W": "Preparing for a resuscitation response to mass disasters, such as major earthquakes or industrial disasters, requires revisions of present local, regional, and national disaster plans. These should include the following: (1) life-supporting first aid and basic rescue capability of the lay public; (2) advanced trauma life support and advanced (heavy) rescue capability brought quickly to the scene from local and surrounding (regional) emergency medical services systems; and (3) trauma hospitals sending medical resuscitation teams to, and receiving casualties from, the disaster scene for resuscitative surgery and definitive care. Local and regional everyday emergency medical services systems would respond first. The armed forces should help, at least for transport and security. We propose that the National Disaster Medical System replace its civil defense model with an emergency medical services model, designed to mobilize rapid support for local emergency medical services systems from regional, state, and national resources. Coordination should be by one federal agency, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which, however, needs to focus more on resuscitation through physician input.\r"

Up to 25% of serological HLA-DR typings may be incorrect when compared with a more accurate DNA-RFLP method, and we have now examined whether incorrect HLA-DR typings account for the lower than expected success rates of HLA-matched cadaver transplants. 58 transplant centres took part in this study and DNA was extracted from over 4000 samples of frozen tissue at the study centre. 8 laboratories then completed blind RFLP typing for HLA-DR. Serological typing data were reported by individual transplant laboratories. 29 of 107 transplants (27%) that were reported as HLA A, B, DR compatible and 76 of 273 (28%) transplants that were reported as HLA B, DR compatible according to serological typing were found to be HLA-DR mismatched by DNA typing. The one-year transplant success rate for DNA-matched HLA, A, B, DR grafts was 87% compared with 69% for mismatched grafts (p less than 0.02); the corresponding success rate for DNA-matched HLA B, DR grafts was 85% compared with 72% for mismatched grafts (p less than 0.01). Many transplants that were previously thought to be HLA matched are mismatched, and this finding may account for previously unexplained graft failures.\r"

The association between self-reported alcohol intake and coronary disease was studied prospectively among 51,529 male health professionals. In 1986 the participants completed questionnaires about food and alcohol intake and medical history, heart disease risk factors, and dietary changes in the previous 10 years. Follow-up questionnaires in 1988 sought information about newly diagnosed coronary disease. 350 confirmed cases of coronary disease occurred. After adjustment for coronary risk factors, including dietary intake of cholesterol, fat, and dietary fibre, increasing alcohol intake was inversely related to coronary disease incidence (p for trend less than 0.001). Exclusion of 10,302 current non-drinkers or 16,342 men with disorders potentially related to coronary disease (eg, hypertension, diabetes, and gout) which might have led men to reduce their alcohol intake, did not substantially affect the relative risks. These findings support the hypothesis that the inverse relation between alcohol consumption and risk of coronary disease is causal.\r"

The prevalence rate of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), defined as enlargement of the prostate gland of equivalent weight greater than 20 g in the presence of symptoms of urinary dysfunction and/or a urinary peak flow rate less than 15 ml/s and without evidence of malignancy, was 253 (95% CI 221-285) per 1000 men in the community, rising from 138 per 1000 men aged 40-49 years to 430 per 1000 men aged 60-69 years. Thus apparently well men have a much higher frequency of BPH than was previously thought to be the case.\r"

  ".W": "The recommended treatment for mild acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children is supportive care only, but many physicians, especially in developing countries, continue to prescribe antibiotic treatment because they believe it prevents progression to more severe ARI. To find out whether ampicillin treatment conferred any benefit over supportive care alone, a randomised, controlled trial was carried out among 889 children (under 5 years) with mild ARI in Indonesia. 447 were randomly allocated ampicillin (25-30 mg/kg body weight three times daily for 5 days) plus supportive care (continued breastfeeding, clearing of the nose, and paracetamol to control fever); 442 were allocated supportive care only. The treatment groups were almost identical after randomisation in terms of age, sex, level of parental education, history of measles immunisation, and fever. After 1 week the percentages cured were nearly identical (204 [46%] ampicillin; 209 [47%] control), as were the percentages of cases progressing to moderate ARI (56 [13%] vs 53 [12%]). The effect of treatment was not modified by age, sex, measles immunisation status, or the educational level of the parents. At the 2-week follow-up, the percentages cured were 62% (277) in the ampicillin group and 58% (256) in the control group; 14% of both groups had progressed to moderate ARI; and 24% (107) and 28% (123), respectively, still had mild ARI. None of the differences in outcome between the ampicillin and control groups was statistically significant. Thus, ampicillin plus supportive care offers no benefit over supportive care alone for treatment of mild ARI in young Indonesian children.\r"

Patients were treated as outpatients and received intravenous ondansetron 4 mg or dexamethasone 8 mg before chemotherapy and oral maintenance (ondansetron 4 mg every 6 h and dexamethasone reducing from 4 mg to 1 mg 6-hourly between days 1 and 5) for 5 days. 112 patients were treated (38 men, 73 women, 1 with no gender recorded; age range 30-73 years) and 100 were evaluable for cross-over analysis. Patients taking ondansetron or dexamethasone reported no significant difference in complete and major control of acute (83% vs 79%, p = 0.46) or delayed (82% vs 88%, p = 0.214) emesis (vomiting plus retches). Significantly more patients on dexamethasone (87%) than on ondansetron (72%) reported control of delayed nausea (days 2-5) (p = 0.003). Both drugs were well tolerated with no significant difference in the number of adverse events, and this is reflected by similar patient preference for ondansetron (40%) and dexamethasone (30%) (p = 0.244). Both drugs offer adequate out-patient control of chemotherapy-induced emesis; however, dexamethasone has an advantage in the control of delayed nausea, and also in terms of cost and resource allocation.\r"

  ".U": "91333250\r", 
  ".W": "Ondansetron, a serotonin antagonist, is effective in controlling the emesis associated with cancer chemotherapy; however, emesis in patients receiving high-dose cisplatin is poorly controlled by ondansetron alone. Dexamethasone is an effective antiemetic with no known interaction with serotonin receptors and was thus chosen for study in combination with ondansetron. 31 patients (30 male, 1 female; median age 28.5 years, range 18-49) receiving a 4-day course of a chemotherapy regimen containing cisplatin (100-120 mg/m2) for metastatic germ-cell tumours were entered in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial comparing oral ondansetron plus placebo with oral ondansetron plus dexamethasone as antiemetic prophylaxis. Ondansetron (8 mg every 8 h) was given to all patients for 8 days from the start of chemotherapy. Patients were given 8 mg of dexamethasone or placebo every 8 h starting 2 h before cisplatin (on day 4) and continuing for six doses (ie, for 2 days only). A second course of chemotherapy began 14 days after the start of the first, during which patients crossed over to the alternative antiemetic regimen. Results were available from 27 patients. In the 24-48 h after cisplatin 78% of patients taking ondansetron plus dexamethasone reported complete or major control of emesis compared with 30% of those taking ondansetron plus placebo (p = 0.001). Cross-over analysis showed a significant advantage for ondansetron plus dexamethasone in the control of nausea (p = 0.013) and emesis (p less than 0.001) over the 8-day study. 24 of 26 patients expressed a preference for the combination therapy (p less than 0.001). Ondansetron plus dexamethasone is effective antiemetic prophylaxis for high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy, has few side effects, and is active when given orally.\r"
