  ".W": "A system was developed to permit perfusion of local brain regions and simultaneous peripheral blood sampling in free-moving caged monkeys. The system comprises a calvarial headpiece that contains multiple push-pull cannulas (PPC), a flexible stainless steel tether, a four-channel fluid swivel, and a surgical procedure for simultaneous multisite brain cannulation. Rhesus macaques were fitted surgically with an indwelling jugular catheter and PPC directed into the third ventricle, median eminence, and preoptic area. These animals were tethered for periods of 14-70 h during which brain perfusates and peripheral blood samples were collected at 10- to 30-min intervals through the tether-swivel assembly. Levels and pulsatile patterns of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in 10-min perfusate samples and luteinizing hormone and cortisol in sequential plasma samples were quantified by specific radioimmunoassays. The normal endocrine profiles in these animals suggest that this system provides a valuable method to study patterns of neurosecretions in an unrestrained simian.\r"

  ".W": "Of 327 patients who had a giant-cell tumor of bone and were seen at the Istituto Rizzoli, 293 were treated at the Institute, and 280 of these were followed for two to forty-four years. The distribution according to sex and age of the patient and site of the tumor was similar to the distributions in major reports of large series. The tumor usually involved the metaphysis and the epiphysis, but was occasionally limited to the metaphysis, and in only 2 per cent of the patients was it adjacent to an open growth plate. The tumor on occasion invaded the articular space, also involving the ligaments and the synovial membrane. Extension to an adjacent bone through the joint occurred in 5 per cent of the tumors. Our radiographic grading, which is roughly comparable with the staging system of Enneking et al., was Grade I in 4 per cent, II in 74 per cent, and III in 22 per cent of 266 patients before treatment. A pathological fracture was apparent on the first radiograph in 9 per cent of the patients. In the 280 patients with adequate follow-up, 331 surgical procedures were performed. The rate of local recurrence was 27 per cent in the 151 intralesional procedures, 8 per cent in the 122 marginal excisions, and zero in the fifty-eight wide or radical procedures. These results did not correlate with the radiographic grade of the lesion. Of the fifty-one local recurrences that were seen after treatment at our institution, 90 per cent appeared in the first three years after surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Over-all, players who wore braces on the knees had significantly more injuries to the knee than players who did not. The severity of the injuries was no different in the two groups. Based on these findings, we cannot recommend the use of these braces in an attempt to prevent injury to collegiate football players.\r"

The patients were evaluated clinically and roentgenographically before and after the arthroplasty. The minimum period of follow-up was twenty-nine months (mean, forty-four months). On the basis of the knee-rating scale of The Hospital for Special Surgery, 89 per cent of the patients had either an excellent or a good result after the arthroplasty. No result was a failure. One patient had loosening of the patellar component, but no other loosening was identified. The results of total knee arthroplasty after osteotomy of the proximal part of the tibia were found to be comparable with the results after arthroplasty in knees that had not had a prior osteotomy. The intraoperative and postoperative rates of complications were not higher, and no untoward technical difficulties were encountered at surgery. These data support the clinical impression that an osteotomy of the proximal part of the tibia does not \"burn any bridges\" insofar as a future successful arthroplasty is concerned.\r"

The patients were followed for two to seventeen years (average, 9.4 years). Twenty-four knees (77 per cent) had either no pain or only occasional mild pain at the last evaluation. Six knees had moderate pain and one, severe pain. Six knees required a subsequent total knee arthroplasty at an average of 9.8 years after the osteotomy. No patient had an infection or non-union. Osteotomy of the proximal part of the tibia is a reasonable method of treating unicompartmental degenerative arthritis in a knee with a valgus deformity. Although some patients with as much as 20 degrees of anatomical valgus deformity obtained a good result in this series, osteotomy in the supracondylar region of the femur is probably preferable if the valgus angulation exceeds 12 degrees or if the tilt of the tibial articular surface that will result from the surgery will exceed 10 degrees. Correction beyond the normal 5 to 7 degrees of valgus angulation to zero degree of anatomical tibiofemoral alignment is recommended to prevent recurrence of the valgus deformity and to decrease the load on the lateral tibiofemoral compartment.\r"

Activation of complement was found when methylmethacrylate was used. In patients in whom components were fixed without cement, no formation of anaphylatoxins occurred, and only slightly reduced whole-complement activity and concentrations of C3, C4, and C5 in plasma were found. A dose-correlated release of the anaphylatoxins was found when monomethylmethacrylate was incubated in fresh serum. One explanation for the hemodynamic instability in these patients might be the biological effects of anaphylatoxins that are released in association with fixation by cement.\r"

We examined variables that were likely to be uncontrolled in routine orthopaedic radiographs for their effect on radiographic (film) density. Changes in film lots, exposure, target distance, field variability (heel effect), and femoral orientation were independently analyzed for radiographs of precisely oriented femora of cadavera and a radiology step-wedge. Despite attempts to normalize these variables, we found that retrospective comparison of serial radiographs of patients for densitometric analysis of change in the bone was prone to significant error. In uncontrolled radiographs, non-uniformity of exposure, intensity of the radiation field, target distance, and deviation in femoral rotation will be likely to result in substantial variations in the apparent thickness or density of the femoral cortex and make quantitative comparisons of serial radiographs unreliable.\r"

The range of motion in the metatarsophalangeal joint was limited postoperatively in 90 per cent of the patients, and in 21 per cent there was recurrence of deformity. The appearance of the foot was poor in 75 per cent. Only 53 per cent of the patients expressed satisfaction with the result of the operation. There was a direct relationship between the development of subluxation or dislocation of the metatarsophalangeal joint and postoperative dissatisfaction of the patient. We concluded that the operation is biomechanically unsound because it does not address the principal mechanical factors that are responsible for the deformity: abnormal function of the adductor hallucis and the abnormal intermetatarsal angle. The Akin procedure is indicated only in combination with other operations that are designed to correct the two cited abnormalities.\r"

Interposition of a graft of bone from the iliac crest was done in four feet with an excessively short hallux. Lateral metatarsalgia that was due to intractable keratoses on the plantar part of the foot was relieved in eleven (92 per cent) of the twelve feet that had it preoperatively. Cock-up deformity of the hallux was also improved. Residual stiffness of the interphalangeal joints, which was a major preoperative problem, was not improved.

Twenty-five of the forty-one dislocations had been diagnosed in less than six months. An axillary radiograph confirmed the diagnosis in all shoulders and demonstrated the approximate size of the impression defect. There were no associated displaced fractures of the humerus, but in twenty of the shoulders there was an undisplaced fracture of the proximal part of the humerus. The average length of follow-up was 5.5 years. For seven shoulders the deformity was accepted. Treatment in the others consisted of closed reduction, which was attempted in twelve shoulders and was successful in six of the twelve; transfer of the subscapularis tendon, which was attempted in nine shoulders and was successful in four; transfer of the lesser tuberosity, which was successful in all four shoulders that were so treated; hemiarthroplasty, which was performed in nine shoulders and was successful in six (the other three required revision); and total arthroplasty in ten shoulders, one of which dislocated postoperatively and was not treated. Once the diagnosis is established, the majority of patients with this lesion can be successfully managed.\r"

One hundred and seventy-five patients had had at least one pregnancy each (Group A) and 180 patients had never been pregnant (Group B). The groups were comparable with regard to the treatments that they had received. After skeletal maturity was reached, the curve progressed more than 5 degrees in 25 per cent and more than 10 degrees in 10 per cent of the patients in each group. The age of the patient at the time of the first pregnancy did not influence the risk of progression, and the stability of the curve before pregnancy did not decrease the risk of its progression during pregnancy. In patients who had had a spinal fusion, progression in the unfused portion of the spine was negligible in both Group A and Group B. The presence of a pseudarthrosis did not result in progression of the curve during pregnancy. The effects of scoliosis on pregnancy and delivery were evaluated in the 175 women in Group A. No specific problems that were directly related to the scoliosis were noted except for four patients, in whom delivery posed difficulties. The incidence of cesarean section was one-half of the national average, and no sections were directly related to the mother's scoliosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean length of follow-up was twenty months, with a range of five to thirty months. All of the children lived in or had visited an area where the disease was known to be endemic. Arthritis was the presenting feature in more than half of the children, and half of the children had initially consulted an orthopaedic surgeon, none of whom made the correct diagnosis. Only twenty patients had a history of erythema chronicum migrans, the characteristic rash that precedes the arthritis, and for only nineteen children was there any recollection of having been bitten by a tick. Three patients had Bell palsy and one had a popliteal cyst in conjunction with the arthritis. All of the patients had oligoarticular involvement. The knee was involved in all but two patients. Recurrent attacks of synovitis were common. Effusion was the only radiographic abnormality that was observed, and it was found in thirty-two patients. The sedimentation rate was elevated in thirty of thirty-six patients. Immunofluorescent serology for Lyme disease, which is sensitive and specific, was uniformly positive. Of thirty-three patients who were treated with oral administration of penicillin or tetracycline alone, thirty-one responded, while two patients who had recurrent attacks of the disease responded to parenteral administration of antibiotics. The remaining ten patients responded to combinations of orally and parenterally administered antibiotics. Longer follow-up is needed to further document the apparently low rate of relapse after antibiotic therapy in this young population.\r"

  ".U": "87109383\r", 
  ".W": "Metatropic dwarfism is a rare heritable skeletal dysplasia that is thought to result from a defect in endochondral ossification. Histological studies have been few and have yielded inconsistent findings. In addition, no investigator has commented on the structure and function of the perichondral portion of the growth plate in patients who have metatropic dysplasia. To further characterize this disturbance, histological studies were carried out on autopsy specimens from the proximal part of the femur and the iliac crest of a patient who had this disorder. The major findings were: the absence of formation of normal primary spongiosa in the metaphysis; the presence of a thin seal of bone at the chondro-osseous junction, with abnormal metaphyseal vascular invasion and arrest of endochondral growth; and normal-appearing perichondral ring structures with persistence of circumferential growth. These findings suggest an uncoupling of endochondral and perichondral growth and offer an explanation for the dumbbell-shaped morphological structure of the osseous metaphysis that is seen in patients who have metatropic dysplasia. Other observations included prominence of the cartilaginous canals and vascular channels in the reserve zone; clumping of chondrocytes with enhanced staining of the pericellular matrix in the proliferative zone; a decreased ratio of cells to matrix in the hypertrophic zone, with intracellular metachromatic granules and incomplete evolution of chondrocytes; complete absence of an alcian-blue-positive zone of provisional calcification; and, finally, islands of dysplastic chondrocytes in the metaphysis. These abnormalities suggest that metatropic dysplasia is not simply a disorder of endochondral ossification. There appear to be associated defects in the longitudinal proliferation and maturation of chondrocytes and in the production of normal matrix.\r"

  ".W": "Although the formation of a secondary center of ossification is often compared with that of the primary center, there are striking differences between these processes. In the formation of the primary center, vascular invasion is always associated with the maturation of chondrocytes, whereas vascularization of the epiphysis can proceed in two different ways. In some species, the epiphysis is vascularized by cartilage canals before the appearance of the secondary center. However, in the mouse, the distal femoral epiphysis is vascularized by peripheral vascular invasion without pre-existing cartilage canals. Histological study of serial sections and studies of vascularization by injection with India ink demonstrated the relationship between hypertrophic chondrocyte formation, vascular invasion, and the formation of the secondary center of ossification in the murine distal femoral epiphysis.\r"

The indications for operation were incapacitating pain, radicular pain, pseudoclaudication, or the inability to stand upright. All patients had shown progression of the deformity after the previous surgery. At an average length of follow-up of fifty-two months, all patients had resumed normal activities and were free of the pain and symptoms of spinal stenosis. The complications included delayed union in six patients and a traumatic pseudarthrosis in one patient. In all of these patients a solid fusion was obtained after additional surgery. In five patients, neuropathy of the fifth lumbar-nerve root developed after surgery; it resolved in three patients. From this work, it is concluded that staged reconstructive surgery is feasible in patients who have Grade-IV or V spondylolisthesis with incapacitating pain and deformity that interfere with normal function. The benefits outweighed the risks in this very select group of patients.\r"

The effect of placing one foot on a block to produce a limb-length difference was also studied in the standing position (thirty patients) and in the forward-bending position (eighteen patients). The degree of rotation of the surface of the back and of kyphosis and lordosis of the surface of the trunk was measured from sections in the sagittal plane that were plotted from the computerized measurements of the surface of the back. Qualitatively similar rotation of the surface of the back was found in both the standing position and the forward-bending position. When the patient was in the forward-bending position, the degree of rotation of the surface of the back was minimally changed in the thoracic region but increased in the lumbar region. The amount of rotation of the surface of the back was similar in both forward bending with the hands to the knees and forward bending with the hands to the toes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The decision to institute prophylaxis in women with menopausal osteopenia is hampered by the absence of quantitative criteria for appraising the risk of fracture in the individual. We have developed standards for assessing the risk of fracture by relating the prevalence of atraumatic vertebral compression fractures to bone density in sixty-five menopausal women, forty-nine to ninety-two years old. To define the upper limit of the spectrum of bone density, we also studied thirty-one young women, seventeen to twenty-two years old. The density of trabecular bone in a vertebral body was determined by quantitative computed tomography and expressed in terms of milligrams per milliliter of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate. Twenty-five of the menopausal women exhibited at least one fracture (range, one to six fractures), and forty had no fracture. The bone density ranged from -9 to sixty-nine milligrams per milliliter in those with fractures and from twelve to 122 milligrams per milliliter in those without a fracture. The densities in the young women averaged 173 milligrams per milliliter and ranged from ninety-five to 248 milligrams per milliliter. The percentage of subjects with fractures increased as the bone density decreased. It was zero per cent in women with a density of seventy milligrams per milliliter or more, 38 per cent in women with a density between fifty and less than seventy milligrams per milliliter, 71 per cent in those with a density between thirty and less than fifty milligrams per milliliter, and 82 per cent in women with a density of less than thirty milligrams per milliliter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical value of computerized tomography in detecting a lesion that is caudad to the level of a myelographic block. For twenty-three patients the cause of the myelographic block was stenosis of the spine; for five patients, a combination of stenosis of the spine and herniation of a disc; for one patient, herniation of a disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae alone; for two patients, arachnoiditis; and for one patient, kyphosis secondary to fracture. A total of fifty vertebral levels that could not be visualized because of the block were evaluated. Thirty (60 per cent) of the non-visualized vertebral levels, in nineteen (59 per cent) of the thirty-two patients, demonstrated stenosis of the spine or a herniated disc that was confirmed at the time of surgical treatment. The value of computerized tomography for the evaluation of the vertebral levels caudad to the level of a complete or almost complete block on a lumbar myelogram was threefold. First, it provided visualization of the vertebral levels that could not be evaluated by the myelography. Second, the findings on computerized tomography provided information that was essential for preoperative planning and it removed the so-called exploratory element from the operative procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The groups were matched according to age and sex of the patient, type of prosthesis and fixation, and length of follow-up. At an average length of follow-up of 2.9 years, a good or excellent result was obtained in 81 per cent of the patients who had had a previous osteotomy. At an average length of follow-up of 2.8 years, a good or excellent result was obtained in 100 per cent of the patients who had had a primary arthroplasty. Two patients in the osteotomy group and none in the primary arthroplasty group required additional surgery. At the time of arthroplasty, technical difficulties in exposing the proximal part of the tibia were noted in three patients in the group that had undergone an osteotomy. The results of total knee arthroplasty after failed proximal tibial osteotomy approached but did not equal the results after primary total knee arthroplasty.\r"

  ".U": "87109390\r", 
  ".W": "Injury to the posterolateral structures of the knee, including the popliteus tendon and arcuate complex, frequently results in poorly understood patterns of instability. To evaluate the static function of these tissues, we used a mechanical testing apparatus that allowed five degrees of freedom to test seventeen specimens from human cadavera at angles of flexion that ranged from zero to 90 degrees. Selective section of the lateral collateral ligament, popliteus-arcuate (deep) ligament complex, anterior cruciate ligament, and posterior cruciate ligament was performed. At all angles of flexion, the lateral collateral ligament and deep ligament complex functioned together as the principal structures preventing varus rotation and external rotation of the tibia, while the posterior cruciate ligament was the principal structure preventing posterior translation. However, at angles of flexion of 30 degrees or less, the amount of posterior translation after section of only the lateral collateral ligament and the deep structures was similar to that noted after isolated section of the posterior cruciate ligament. Isolated section of the posterior cruciate ligament did not affect varus or external rotation of the tibia at any position of flexion of the knee. When the posterior cruciate ligament was sectioned after the lateral collateral ligament and deep ligament complex had been cut, a large increase in posterior translation and varus rotation resulted at all angles of flexion. In addition, at angles of flexion of more than 30 degrees, external rotation of the tibia also increased. The application of internal tibial torque resulted in no increase in tibial rotation after isolated section of the anterior cruciate ligament or combined section of the lateral collateral ligament and deep ligament complex. However, combined section of all three structures increased internal rotation at 30 and 60 degrees of flexion. The increases in external rotation that were produced by section of the lateral collateral ligament and deep ligament complex were not changed by the addition of the section of the anterior cruciate ligament.\r"

Thirty-one of the wrists were examined at follow-up one and two years later. The first fifteen wrists that were allowed full flexion and extension immediately postoperatively had lost some volar tilt postoperatively. The other patients, for whom only flexion was allowed immediately postoperatively, while extension was allowed four weeks later, did not lose volar tilt. The device maintained the reduction of the fracture fragments and allowed the early return of a functional range of motion of the wrist.\r"

Of these seventeen patients, all were re-evaluated at an average of six months and eleven were re-evaluated at an average of three and one-half years after operation. Bilateral nerve-conduction studies were done on all seventeen patients during the initial visit and on five of the eleven who were re-evaluated at an average of three and one-half years. Abnormal slowing of the conduction times was found in both nerves, suggesting a possible predisposition to this condition. Based on the results of the study, it is suggested that many patients may have a subclinical ulnar neuropathy that may become symptomatic as a result of the many maneuvers and manipulations that are associated with surgical procedures.\r"

Thirty-seven patients did not have hemangiomas (Ollier disease) and seven did (Maffucci syndrome).

In four of the seven patients who had Maffucci syndrome, there were six low-grade chondrosarcomas, one high-grade osteosarcoma, one pancreatic adenocarcinoma, one biliary adenocarcinoma, and one astrocytoma. None of the patients in either group died of the skeletal sarcoma, but four of five patients who had a non-skeletal malignant lesion died. From life-table analyses of these patients, we estimated that the incidence of secondary chondrosarcoma in patients who have Ollier disease is about 25 per cent at the age of forty years, and that malignant degeneration is almost a certainty in patients who have Maffucci syndrome. We concluded that periodic surveillance of the brain and abdomen for occult malignant lesions is indicated in patients who have enchondromatosis.\r"

These were analysed to determine causal factors and the efficacy of various surgical techniques of repair. There were two principle causes: intimal hyperplasia (n = 19) and progressive atherosclerosis (n = 18), and then miscellaneous causes (n = 15). Surgical techniques included: repair of inflow by thrombectomy (n = 30), new aorto-femoral graft (n = 6), cross-over femoro-femoral (n = 3), and axillo-bifemoral graft (n = 2); repair of out-flow by profundoplasty (n = 18), addition of a new length of graft (n = 10), and femoro-popliteal bypass (n = 13). There were no immediate post-operative deaths but four rethromboses (7.6%) occurred and there were five amputations (9.6%). During the follow-up period (mean 19 months), four patients died (11%), 5 limbs reoccluded (9.4%), and two were amputated (4.2%). Patency rate was 90% for thrombectomy and 83% for new aorto-bifemoral graft. It was 86% for repair of the profunda femoris artery and 77% for femoro-popliteal bypass. Although no statistical analysis can be applied on this small number of patients, the present study suggests that: intimal hyperplasia is a frequent and probably under-estimated cause of late thrombosis; whenever feasible thrombectomy and profundoplasty are the most simple and effective procedure of repair.\r"

In the remaining patient an episode of postoperative peritonitis occurred with leakage of the gastrointestinal anastomosis. The patient died on the 78th postoperative day from a massive metastasis to the liver. Autopsy revealed a narrowing of the graft due to technical failure and inflammatory changes, but there was no evidence of cancer invasion. Thus, the autograft of the splenic vein proved useful to bridge the portal vein system.\r"

Forty-seven underwent operations using a standard carotid closure; a second group of forty-two patients had a saphenous vein patch graft applied in closure. The patients were evaluated with carotid duplex scans at regular intervals to evaluate the incidence of early restenosis. Patients with positive duplex scans underwent arterial angiography or digital subtraction angiography. Operative mortality was zero. Twelve late deaths occurred; eleven due to cardiac disease. In the unpatched group, 19.1% of the patients developed significant restenosis (a luminal narrowing of greater than 50%) with only a 2.4% incidence occurring in the patched group, a statistically significant difference (p less that 0.05). There was a higher incidence of symptomatic restenosis in the unpatched group, though the results were not considered significant. Venous patch rupture was seen in three patients who have not been included in the study group. All of these had venous patches harvested from a distal greater saphenous vein site at the ankle. The authors recommend venous patch closure with a thicker patch taken from the proximal saphenous vein at the groin to reduce the incidence of early restenosis and to avoid venous patch rupture. Regular non-invasive evaluation is recommended to detect restenosis with careful clinical follow-up to evaluate neurologic complications.\r"

During operation, blood was withdrawn before and five minutes after administration of 10,000 units of heparin for the measurements of activated clotting time (ACT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). There was considerable variation in the ACT and the PTT values at five minutes after heparin administration which showed no correlation to the patients' weight. However, there was a significant linear correlation between the increase in ACT values and the HNA measured on the day before operation and a significant linear correlation between the HNA and the fibrinogen concentration. The results indicate that the ACT and PTT after giving heparin depended on HNA rather than the patients' weight, and are related to the fibrinogen concentration.\r"

One of the patients presented with severe pain in the abdomen and signs of impending rupture of the aneurysm and the other had a frank ruptured aneurysm with peripheral circulatory failure. Both cases were managed successfully by surgery. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms due to aorto-arteritis are distinctly uncommon. Rupture of these aneurysms is even rarer and to the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case in English literature of successful surgical management of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm due to aorto-arteritis.\r"

In another patient, graft replacement of the aorta was associated with regression of the fibrosis but in a third patient replacement of the aorta did not prevent progression to complete ureteric obstruction. It would seem that it is the presence of the fibrosis that engenders the aortic dilatation not the presence of a patent aorta, dilated or not.\r"

The remaining seven had CFA disease in tandem with either inflow aortoiliac disease or associated distal occlusions. Physical examination and vascular laboratory studies failed to suggest the diagnosis in every instance. Angiography was definitive in revealing the location and extent of pathology. Patients with localized disease were treated by patch angioplasty, balloon dilatation, or by graft replacement and profundaplasty.

We regard the brush as the common sense solution for producing smooth bores after various peripheral vascular procedures such as endarterectomy and late arterial and venous thrombo-embolectomy operations. As a reamer and a smoothing instrument it exerts a powerful yet safe and self-limiting action, due to the compliant, impaling effect of the bristles at low intra-luminal pressure. Broadly speaking, the use of the brush is indicated when the smooth Fogarty balloon catheter is no longer capable of removing resistant residual tissue. The use of this instrument on a wider scale, eventually in disposable form, would seem to offer considerable promise in peripheral vascular surgery.\r"

Concern over the late development of right ventricular and sinus node dysfunction has prompted increased use of the arterial repair. This approach was utilized in 11 patients ranging in age from 7 days to 22 months (mean 5.3 months) and in weight from 2.6 to 12.2 kg (mean 5.1 kg). Five patients had intact ventricular septum and underwent primary repair electively or after poor response to balloon atrial septostomy. A large ventricular septal defect (VSD) was present in 6 patients, one of whom had coarctation of the aorta and one with type B interrupted aortic arch. Pulmonary artery banding was done in 3 of these patients in addition to subclavian artery aortoplasty and primary arch repair. Spontaneous VSD closure occurred in 2 banded patients. All patients had normal coronary artery distribution. Conduits were not used in any repair. There were 2 operative deaths caused by injury to the right coronary artery prior to establishing bypass in one patient and to left ventricular (LV) failure in a patient operated on at 5 months of age with an LV pressure of only one-half systemic level. The 9 surviving patients are well from 4 to 38 months after operation (mean 15 months). No patient has congestive heart failure and 5 receive no medications. Catheterization in 4 patients revealed widely patent coronaries in each. Trivial aortic insufficiency was noted in 1 patient. Each had mild to moderate supravalvar pulmonary stenosis (12 to 51 mmHg). LV function was normal in each case.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Within the group, there were included 26 patients who had aneurysm resection for dyspnoea and who were evaluated by radionuclide angiography at a mean follow-up of 17 + 11 months. There was a 20% early mortality; this fell to 5% in the latter half of this experience. Patients whose major symptom was angina had a 5% early mortality. Those whose major symptom was severe dyspnoea had an early mortality of 30%. Patients who had aneurysm reduction alone had an early mortality of 17% and those who had associated bypass grafting had an early mortality of 9%. There was a 48% late mortality, attrition occurring at a steady rate and being predominantly due to cardiovascular causes. Of 95 patients available for review between one and thirteen years after operation, 60% were in New York Heart Association (N.Y.H.A.) functional class I, 36% in functional class II and 4% in classes III and IV. In patients whose predominant symptom was dyspnoea, radionuclide studies showed that global left ventricular performance at rest was not significantly changed by operation, despite clinical improvement. Long-term clinical outcome was determined more by pre-operative global ventricular function than by function of the residual contractile segment. Within the whole group, however, both early mortality and symptomatic improvement were more likely in patients with predominant angina.\r"

We report 21 patients who developed cardiac tamponade 5 to 53 days after open heart operations. Possible etiological factors included anticoagulant therapy (19 patients), excessive mediastinal drainage in the postoperative period (10 patients), postpericardiotomy syndrome (4 patients), and coagulation disorders (1 patient). The clinical presentation was insidious and the diagnosis was often difficult to establish at the outset. A high index of clinical suspicion and echocardiography were the most reliable means to reach an early diagnosis. Twenty patients in whom delayed tamponade was suspected were operated and all of them survived. In one patient tamponade was not diagnosed antemortem and he died; on autopsy left heart compression by a large loculated clot was found. Decompression of the pericardial space can be accomplished by pericardiocentesis or by surgical means (subxiphoid pericardiotomy, median sternotomy, or thoracotomy). Although pericardiocentesis alone may be effective, mainly when the postpericardiotomy syndrome is the suspected etiology, we recommend open procedures since the presence of blood clots and adhesions has been a frequent finding.\r"

The anomalies can be defined as: tortuosity, when the artery has a \"C\" or \"S\" shape; coiling, when the elongation is more evident and the artery forms one or more loops; kinking, when there is a sharp angulation of the first portion of the internal carotid artery. The etiology of these peculiar arterial modifications seems to be related to a congenital basis which may become exaggerated with ageing of the artery. Surgical correction should include intra-arterial inspection (TEA) as well as eliminating the pathological elongation. The Authors presents their 9 cases surgical experience.\r"

The diagnosis was made by emergency bedside right heart catheterization which showed a 7 cm H2O gradient between the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium and also a 12 cm H2O pressure difference between the femoral vein and the right atrium with a normal capillary wedge pressure. Re-thoracotomy with evacuation of blood clots and control of bleeding points improved the hemodynamics dramatically. However the patient succumbed 3 weeks later due to irreversible brain damage. This is thought to be the first report of a late partial right atrial tamponade in the English medical literature.\r"

We instilled 100 ml of autologous serum either alone or with a beta-adrenergic agonist (terbutaline, 10(-5) M, or epinephrine, 5.5 X 10(-6) M) into one lower lobe. After 4 h both terbutaline and epinephrine increased lung liquid clearance. The increase in lung liquid clearance was inhibited when propranolol (a beta blocker) or amiloride (a sodium channel blocker) was added to the terbutaline. Increased clearance was not explained by changes in pulmonary hemodynamics, pulmonary blood flow, or lung lymph flow. We conclude that beta-adrenergic agonists increase lung liquid clearance in anesthetized intact adult sheep. This increase is mediated through beta receptors and probably depends on increased active transport of sodium across the alveolar barrier.\r"

We recently demonstrated virtual absence of plasmalogen-type alkoxyether lipids and deficiency in key enzymes of their biosynthesis in Zellweger patients. We hypothesized that PAF synthesis might also be impaired. We report two Zellweger patients with an undetectable A23187-induced PAF synthesis of leukocytes (patients, less than 3 pmol PAF/10(8) granulocytes (PMN); four age-matched controls, 249-2,757 pmol PAF/10(8) PMN; five adult controls, 291-5,433 pmol PAF/10(8) PMN). In a third patient, residual PAF synthesis was detected. However in all patients the thrombin-induced third mechanism of platelet aggregation was present. We therefore conclude that PAF may not be the mediator of the third pathway.\r"

[1-14C]oleate or [1-14C]palmitate bound to albumin was infused at a constant rate of 25 microCi/h. Oxidation was determined by measuring the 14CO2 production. The data demonstrated that a high percentage (84 +/- 17%) of the palmitate and oleate extracted by the myocardium underwent rapid oxidation. A highly significant correlation was present between the arterial level and the amount oxidized (r = 0.82, P less than 0.001 for palmitate; r = 0.77, P less than 0.001 for oleate). The isotope extraction ratio was greater than the chemical extraction ratio.

  ".W": "The role of membrane transport in the cellular accumulation of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) was studied in freshly isolated human acute leukemia cells. Patient cells had low rates for ara-C transport as compared with human and murine experimental cells and correspondingly low binding capacities for the nucleoside transport inhibitor, nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR). At 1 microM ara-C, the rate of net cellular accumulation was close to the membrane transport rate, and NBMPR inhibited transport and accumulation to the same extent. The rate of ara-C accumulation was half maximal at only 3-5 microM, a level much lower than that required for murine cells (67-85 microM). At concentrations below 1 microM the rate of ara-C accumulation was determined primarily by the transport rate, but at higher concentrations above 10 microM, phosphorylation capacity was the principal determinant of the net uptake rate. This difference in the role of transport at high and low ara-C concentrations may explain, in part, the efficacy of high-dose ara-C in patients refractory to standard dose protocols.\r"

First, opsonization of S. pneumoniae mediated by the alternative pathway in patients' sera was restored to normal by addition of the purified IgG or IgM fraction of goat antiserum to capsular polysaccharide of the homologous serotype. Secondly, IgG antibody titers to capsular polysaccharide in patients' sera correlated significantly with alternative pathway-mediated opsonization; the correlation between titers of IgM anticapsular antibodies and opsonization approached statistical significance. The sum of the IgG and IgM anticapsular antibody titers correlated most significantly with opsonization. Our results suggest that reduction in alternative pathway-mediated opsonization in sera from children with sickle cell disease is related to low levels of both IgG and IgM anticapsular antibodies.\r"

The peptide is released into the cell incubation medium and its formation is unaffected by a variety of lysosomotropic or other agents. Use of specific radioimmunoassays and gel filtration demonstrated in both normal subjects and in chronic renal failure patients a plasma peptide having the properties of the hormone fragment identified by cell studies. Studies of the dog revealed a positive gradient of the fragment across the liver and no differential gradient of the fragment and glucagon across the kidney. We conclude that the glucagon fragment arises from the cell-mediated processing of the hormone on a superficial aspect of the hepatocyte, the glucagon fragment identified during experiments in vitro represents the cognate of a peptide formed during the hepatic metabolism of glucagon in vivo, and measurement of the fragment by COOH-terminal radioimmunoassays could lead to an understimulation of hepatic glucagon extraction.\r"

We have previously shown that murine J774 macrophages, unlike mouse peritoneal macrophages, accumulate large amounts of CE from unmodified low density lipoprotein (LDL). We now report a direct comparison of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) activity in J774 and mouse peritoneal macrophages. Despite similar chloroquine-inhibitable 125I-LDL degradation in the two macrophages, ACAT activity in LDL-treated J774 macrophages was 10-30-fold higher than that in LDL-treated mouse peritoneal macrophages. In contrast, acetyl-LDL (matched for degradation with LDL) caused marked stimulation of ACAT activity in mouse peritoneal macrophages. From these data we conclude that in the presence of LDL, J774 macrophages have a highly active ACAT cholesterol esterification pathway compared with mouse peritoneal macrophages; and in mouse peritoneal macrophages, there is a marked difference in the ability of acetyl-LDL vs. LDL to stimulate ACAT even when the lipoproteins are matched for degradation.\r"

In contrast to amrinone, milrinone stimulated resorption in cultures of neonatal mouse calvaria and fetal rat limb bones. Threshold doses were 0.1 microM in calvaria and 0.1 mM in limb bones; maximal stimulation occurred in calvaria at 0.1 mM. Maximal responses to milrinone and parathyroid hormone were comparable. Milrinone concentrations below 0.1 mM did not affect calvarial cyclic AMP. 0.5 microM indomethacin inhibited milrinone effects in calvaria but usually not in limb bones. 3 nM calcitonin inhibited milrinone-stimulated resorption and there was no escape from this inhibition. Structural homology between milrinone and thyroxine has been reported. We find similarities between milrinone and thyroxine actions on bone, because prostaglandin production was crucial for the effects of both agents in calvaria but not in limb bones, and neither agent exhibited escape from calcitonin inhibition.\r"

The effects of IGF-I on new GH mRNA synthesis rates in primary monolayer rat pituitary cells were therefore examined by nuclear runoff transcription assays. IGF-I (1.3 nM) treatment for 1 h inhibited GH gene transcription to 60% of controls. IGF-I (3.25 nM) maximally suppressed GH gene transcription to 30% of control values after 4 h. After 24 h treatment, GH transcription was suppressed to 48% of controls by 3.25 nM IGF-I. IGF-I (3.25 nM) also inhibited the twofold growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) (10 nM)-stimulated GH gene transcription by 30% after 4 h. Transcription of the prolactin (PRL) gene was not suppressed in these cells by IGF-I. Relatively high doses of insulin (200 nM) also suppressed GH gene transcription, but epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor did not change GH mRNA synthesis. The results show that IGF-I exerts a rapid and selective suppression of basal and GHRH-stimulated GH gene transcription. These data indicate a role for IGF-I in negative feedback of GH gene expression and provide evidence for the direct transcriptional regulation of the GH gene by IGF-I in primary rat anterior pituitary cells.\r"

Phenotypically they resembled a connective tissue stromal cell. A second population of mononuclear cells lacked receptors for skeletal hormones and did not persist in culture. These cells were likely of monocyte-macrophage lineage. A third population of cells consisted of large multinucleated giant cells. These cells possessed phenotypic features of osteoclasts including receptors for calcitonin. Human giant cell tumors of bone are most likely a neoplasm of connective tissue stromal cells, which have the capacity to recruit and interact with multinucleated giant cells that exhibit phenotypic features of osteoclasts.\r"

The circulating t1/2 of red cells from mice which had been erythropoietically suppressed for 8 wk was less than 1 d compared with a t1/2 of 15 d for red cells from normal animals. The most obvious alteration in membrane proteins was an increase in the ratio of the membrane skeletal components 4.1a:4.1b from 0.3 for the normal red cell population to greater than 1 for these old cells. The 4.1a:4.1b ratio thus appears to be a useful index of red cell age. Analyses of the density profile of cells aged in the hypertransfused mice disclosed that these old cells had a density range similar to that of controls, suggesting that cell density does not increase significantly with red cell age in the mouse.\r"

Nonischemic rhythmic handgrip and mild arm cycling produced graded increases in heart rate and arterial pressure but did not increase MSNA, whereas ischemic handgrip and moderate arm cycling dramatically increased MSNA. There was a slow onset and offset of the MSNA responses, which suggested metaboreceptor mediation. When forearm ischemia was continued after ischemic handgrip, MSNA remained elevated (muscle chemoreflex stimulation) but heart rate returned to control (elimination of central command). The major new conclusions are that: the onset of dynamic exercise does not produce mass, uniform sympathetic discharge in humans, and muscle chemoreflexes and central command appear to produce differential effects on sympathetic and parasympathetic responses.\r"

We compare the antiproliferative activities of these drugs against six human cell lines derived from breast (T47-D), pancreas (MiaPaCa, RWP-2), prostate (DU-145), colon (HCT-8), and cervix (HeLa) carcinomas. Tumor cells enriched in cathodal LDH isozymes (LDH4 and LDH5) are significantly more sensitive to gossypol and rhodamine-123. When compared for ability to inhibit growth of human marrow in soft agar, 10 microM gossypol shows little effect on colony formation whereas 10 microM rhodamine-123 completely prevents stem cell growth, suggesting that gossypol may have the most favorable therapeutic index. Within 24 h of drug administration, there is a relative increase in intracellular inorganic phosphate pools and a marked decline in soluble high-energy phosphates in sensitive tumor cells, as measured by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These studies suggest that specific antimitochondrial agents might be selectively administered on the basis of tumor LDH isozyme content and noninvasively monitored for antiproliferative activity by 31P spectroscopy.\r"

Activation of protein kinase C was correlated with stimulation of enhanced proliferative activity of colonic mucosa and reactive oxygen production. TPA and OAG, but not DOC, directly activated soluble protein kinase C in vitro. However, DOC rapidly increased labeled inositol phosphate and diacylglycerol accumulation in colonic epithelial cells. Retinoic acid inhibited protein kinase C activity and suppressed DOC-, TPA-, and OAG-induced increases in reactive oxygen production. The results support a role for protein kinase C in the stimulation of colonic epithelial proliferative activity and reactive oxygen production induced by bile acids, TPA and OAG. In contrast to TPA and OAG, which activate protein kinase C directly, bile acids appear to activate protein kinase C indirectly by increasing the diacylglycerol content of colonic epithelium.\r"

Basal and peak acid outputs were significantly higher in ulcer patients. In contrast, acid secretion was similar in the groups when food was infused into the stomach and when sham feeding was combined with meal infusion to simulate normal eating. Meal-stimulated acid secretion, expressed as a percentage of peak acid output to correct for differences in secretory capacity, was lower in ulcer patients (P less than 0.002). Basal serum gastrin concentrations were higher in ulcer patients, which may have contributed to higher basal acid output. However, increases in serum gastrin after food were similar in the groups. Duodenal ulcer patients, as a group, have increased basal and maximal acid secretion, but the amount of acid secreted and gastrin released after eating is normal.\r"

The development of monoclonal antibodies to gpL-115 has permitted the detection of molecular heterogeneity in gpL-115 from the lymphocytes of immunodeficient patients. When lymphocytes from normal individuals were analyzed by immunoblotting, gpL-115 with only a single molecular species (115 kD) was detected. Lymphocytes from 17 immunodeficient patients were analyzed after overnight incubation. Two patients had no gpL-115 with an Mr of 115 kD, but gpL-115 with an Mr of either 95 or 135 kD was detected. Nine patients had gpL-115 with Mr equally of 95 and 115 Kd. Other patients exhibited gpL-115 with combinations of 95, 115, and 135 kD. The heterogeneity of the degraded gpL-115 suggests that WAS and other X-linked immunodeficiencies are due to a series of abnormalities, all of which involve gpL-115, and may explain the clinical heterogeneity of the diseases.\r"

Preferential allelic associations of HLA genes and gene products have thus been constructed for susceptibility to these diseases. DR alpha and DQ alpha gene polymorphisms indicated heterogeneity of HLA DR3, DRw6, and DR7, and HLA DR2 and DRw6, respectively. In DR7 positive CD patients a 3.8-kilobase (kb) DR alpha fragment, which correlated with DQw3, was found in only 11% of patients compared with 45% of corresponding controls (P less than 0.05). An increased frequency of a DX alpha genotype UU in all three diseases was found (IDDM 59%, DH 45%, CD 48%, compared to 21% in controls, P less than 0.001), which is not explained solely by the increased frequencies of DR3-DX alpha U. We therefore conclude part of the genetic susceptibility for these three conditions is encoded by genes within the DQ-DX subregion.\r"

The current studies, using [35S]methionine pulse-labeled purified preparations of virus-exposed macrophages, depleted of lymphocytes, demonstrate that the presence of these viral proteins does represent new synthesis. However, purified lymphocytes, depleted of monocytes-macrophages and exposed to influenza virus, showed no detectable viral protein synthesis. In further experiments, unseparated mononuclear leukocytes were exposed to virus and subsequently separated by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation. Both macrophages and lymphocytes were then shown to synthesize influenza proteins. Cell-free control or influenza virus-infected macrophage-derived supernatant fluids did not facilitate influenza virus infection of the lymphocytes. The data suggest that macrophages are required for influenza virus infection of human lymphocytes, and raise the possibility that macrophage facilitation of an abortive infection of lymphocytes plays a role in the generation of effective immunity to viral antigens.\r"

Conditioned media were prepared by incubation in alpha minimum essential medium of adipocyte precursors derived from lean and massively obese subjects. Adipocyte-precursor-derived conditioned media from the obese stimulated replication of cultured rat perirenal adipocyte precursors by about fourfold over control. The effect of media conditioned by precursors derived from lean subjects was much less evident. The mitogenicity of conditioned media was abolished by trypsin, indicating the protein nature of the mitogenic factor(s). Sephacryl S-200 chromatography of adipocyte-precursor-derived conditioned media from obese subjects revealed one major active fraction with molecular masses in the range of 25,000-40,000. Our results demonstrate that adipocyte precursors derived from massively obese subjects release factors mitogenic on cultured rat adipocyte precursors. These principles may act as paracrine factors contributing to the development of the adipocyte hyperplasia characteristic of massive obesity.\r"

Lymph nodes and peripheral blood from AILD patients were found to contain clones of lymphoid cells harboring either immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements that, in some instances, regressed during the course of disease. A lymph node from one patient was involved by immunoblastic lymphoma and manifested an additional gene rearrangement pattern not seen in premalignant specimens from that patient. In contrast, DNA obtained from normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 11 examples of other forms of lymphoid hyperplasia showed no gene rearrangements. As a disorder of cellular immunoregulation in which lymphoid cells may escape normal growth controls, AILD provides a natural model to dissect stages of lymphomagenesis in man.\r"

Calmodulin-binding proteins of 230, 212, 204, 164, 139, 70, 59, 46.5, and 41 kD were identified. A protein with a mobility identical to the 59-kD calmodulin-binding protein was labeled by antiserum against calmodulin-dependent phosphatase. Although Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase activity was detected, there was no different in activity between control and CF fibroblasts or in the level of phosphatase protein as determined by radioimmunoassay. Lower amounts of 125I-calmodulin were bound to the 46.5-kD calmodulin-binding protein in CF fibroblasts as compared with controls. The 46.5-kD calmodulin-binding protein may be reduced in CF fibroblasts or its structure may be altered resulting in a reduced binding capacity and/or affinity for calmodulin and perhaps reflecting, either directly or indirectly, the genetic defect responsible for cystic fibrosis.\r"

The mRNA is most abundant in brain, and is especially enriched in the brain microvascular fraction. The mRNA abundance in rat muscle and fat is 5% that in brain. Rat liver (both adult and fetal) and human liver have very little 2.8-kb mRNA, but it is abundant in cultured human fibroblasts and EB virus-transformed lymphoblasts. The same size mRNA is present in leg muscle of two type II diabetic patients. A very homologous glucose transporter mRNA is expressed in both insulin-sensitive and -insensitive tissues of rat and man. Hepatocytes, which have abundant glucose transport, may express a homologous but nonidentical glucose transporter.\r"

They were compared with 21 normal subjects. Both genotypes of Hb H disease had increased activities of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase when compared with those of controls. Comparison of the two genotypes showed that subjects with alpha-thalassaemia 1/Hb CS, the more severe disease, had higher SOD and GSH-Px activities but lower catalase activity than those with alpha-thalassaemia 1/2. This indicates that there are compensatory mechanisms in Hb H erythrocytes to cope with increased generation of oxygen free radicals as a result of increased excess beta chain.\r"

All the sera with IgG, IgM, or IgA immunoglobulins specific to C trachomatis recognised the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of elementary bodies. IgG antibodies also detected several other proteins, whereas IgM immunoglobulins recognised only MOMP and proteins of 60 kD, 62 kD, and 66 kD. The IgA reacted with MOMP and the 60 kD and 62 kD proteins in elementary bodies. Class specific antibody response against the proteins of reticulate bodies was similar to that observed for elementary body antigens--with one substantial difference: no reaction was observed in the 60 kD and 62 kD positions.

All of these cases had at least five years of follow up. When regression analysis was used, the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics' (FIGO) staging system was the best indicator for prognosis. Analysis of a combination of morphometric features was the second best indicator, being especially useful for the those patients with stage I disease. Variables that indicated a relatively poor prognostic outcome were mitotic index above 30; volume percentage epithelium above 65%; shortest nuclear axis above a mean of 1 X 1 micrometers. Histological typing of ovarian tumours was of limited value; mucinous tumours have a somewhat better prognosis than serous tumours, but the prognostic value of typing alone was found to be limited. Qualitative histological grading was useful, but the prognostic value of morphometric grading was better. Measurement of morphological features with an interactive computer program is simple and can be done by a pathologist or a technician: in future it is likely that such automated systems of measurement will improve the objectivity of tissue analysis.\r"

The chemotactic activity of monocytes correlated with that of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the same patients. Exacerbation of psoriasis was preceded by a rapid increase of polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, and a decline of chemotaxis occurred during clinical improvement. The psoriatic leukocytes were 22% more sensitive than normal leukocytes to leukotriene B4 than to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Psoriatic plasma showed chemotaxis-enhancing properties, but only in patients with widespread cutaneous lesions. Additionally, monocyte and polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis was studied in twenty patients with pustular psoriasis and in fifteen patients with psoriatic arthritis. The chemotactic profiles in pustular psoriasis were different from those in psoriasis vulgaris. Patients with pustular psoriasis had significantly higher polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis than patients with psoriasis vulgaris, but the chemotactic activity of monocytes was normal. The presence of seronegative arthritis had no influence on chemotactic activity of psoriatic leukocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Atopic dermatitis patients have both a chronic colonization of their skin with Staphylococcus aureus and a delayed cutaneous hyporesponsiveness to intradermally injected staphylococcal antigens. It has not been established whether the cutaneous anergy merely reflects a specific lymphocyte hyporesponsiveness to staphylococcal antigens. Therefore the lymphocyte proliferative response to staphylococci was assessed in twelve patients with slight to severe atopic dermatitis and in eleven healthy subjects. Compared to the normal subjects, the patients showed significantly higher stimulation indices with S. aureus Wood 46 (p less than 0.05) and purified S. aureus cell walls (p less than 0.05). There was no significant correlation between the lymphocyte stimulation and the clinical severity of the disease. Therefore, chronic colonization of the skin of atopic dermatitis patients by S. aureus does not correlate with a defect in the cellular immune response to the bacteria but may rather stimulate such a response.\r"

  ".W": "The carcinogenic risk of methoxsalen plus ultraviolet A treatment (PUVA) is almost certainly related to the cumulative UVA exposure dose. A reliable estimate of UVA dose is a major component, therefore, in determining the long-term safety of this treatment modality. Thirty-one UVA meters from twenty-nine different PUVA treatment centers were compared with a calibrated UVA meter. The results inferred that 95% of UVA meters used in PUVA centers are reading between 57% and 159% of the true UVA irradiance, a factor of 2.8 in relative sensitivity. This wide variation in accuracy between the UVA meters gives cause for concern. These variations were attributed to differences in calibration procedure, optical properties of the sensors, and, most importantly, poor quality control by the manufacturers. The situation that appears to have existed since the introduction of PUVA therapy can be improved only if dermatologists agree that the present inaccurate and uncertain approach to UVA measurements is unsatisfactory. Manufacturers of UVA meters should be encouraged to provide instruments as reliable as the dosimeters used in radiotherapy, in which the prescribed dose is probably within 5% of the true value. Ideally, a standard type of UVA meter with appropriate physical properties and an agreed calibration procedure should be used by all centers engaged in PUVA treatment.\r"

The most important discriminating histologic feature in patients with Sezary syndrome was the presence of a monotonous bandlike or perivascular infiltrate in the papillary dermis, mainly composed of large cerebriform-mononuclear cells, as seen in seven of eleven Sezary syndrome patients. Pautrier's microabscesses were observed in seven of eleven Sezary syndrome patients, two of four patients with erythrodermic mycosis fungoides, but not in any of the patients with a benign form of erythroderma; their presence was therefore considered a reliable criterion in differentiating erythrodermic cutaneous T cell lymphoma from benign forms of erythroderma. However, features of chronic dermatitis were often found superimposed on those of Sezary syndrome and were even predominating in four of eleven Sezary syndrome patients. Moreover, four patients with a benign form of erythroderma showed a histologic picture suggestive of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Therefore, in dubious cases repeated skin biopsies, additional investigations of lymph nodes and peripheral blood, and careful follow-up are mandatory for the achievement of a correct diagnosis.\r"

This study investigates the risk of transmission of hepatitis B virus by such electrodes during simulated use with electrodesiccation. Sterile needle electrodes were inoculated with either purified hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg+) concentrate or serum positive for both HBsAg and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase activity (a measure of infectious and replicating hepatitis B virus), followed by simulated use for electrodesiccation at various settings and rinsing of the tip with negative serum. The rinse serum was then assayed for HBsAg, DNA polymerase activity, and the presence of viral particles by electron microscopy. HBsAg could be transferred through the electrodesiccation procedure at all settings used. Although DNA polymerase activity was negative in the rinse serum, electron microscopy demonstrated transfer of HBsAg forms and complete virus. These results suggest a potential risk of spread of hepatitis B virus by reusable needle electrodes for electrodesiccation.\r"

They do require accurate recognition, which can be helpful in the diagnosis and management of a hair disorder, or in the detection of underlying disease. A reliable evaluation of hair shaft abnormality is dependent on familiarity with the vast structural variations in normal hair, the hair growth cycle, and the changes produced by weathering. These structural abnormalities can be congenital or acquired, and some are associated with hair fragility. The classification used here has the advantage of simplicity and is keyed to easy recognition of the abnormalities under the light microscope. The four major types of abnormality are fractures, irregularities, twisting, and extraneous matter affecting the hair shaft. The diagnostic features of the different hair shaft abnormalities are outlined.\r"

Thirty-six patients with a total of seventy-one tumors (forty squamous cell carcinomas, twenty-three basal cell carcinomas) were observed. In contrast to the U.S. sixteen-center study, we were unable to demonstrate a clinically relevant increase in the risk of tumors induced by psoralens with ultraviolet A (PUVA), and we also failed to show a clear relationship between PUVA exposure and tumor development. Almost all patients with tumors had been exposed to various carcinogens before the initiation of PUVA. No tumors were detected in patients without such prior treatment, although 10% of the patients had received more than 3,000 joules/cm2 total cumulative phototoxic PUVA dose during the observation period. The discrepancy between the results of the U.S. study and our findings may partly be explained by a variety of factors such as a different treatment approach, a different attitude toward sun exposure, and the overall lower incidence of skin cancer in the European population.\r"

This is a report of the clinical, pathologic, immunofluorescence, and immunoperoxidase studies of peculiar papular lesions that have been observed to occur during the chronic phase of hepatitis B virus infection. A total of thirteen patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were studied. Twelve had asymptomatic, recurrent, erythematous papular lesions localized on the back, chest, and proximal areas of the upper extremities that lasted 6 to 7 days. The histopathology of these skin lesions showed a superficial and deep perivascular dermal mononuclear cell infiltrate. Immunoperoxidase studies for HBsAg and direct immunofluorescence for IgG, IgM, IgA, and C3 showed negative results. An abnormal host response to viral antigens other than HBsAg is suggested as a possible mechanism responsible for appearance of these skin lesions.\r"

In a group of 400 consecutive dermatologic patients, idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis was much more prevalent in women than in men. However, in both sexes this prevalence became more common with advancing age. In another group of fifteen patients with idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis and fifteen normal controls matched by age, sex, and skin type, the following was found: A cause-effect relationship between chronic actinic exposure and the development of idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis could not be established by statistical studies. A family aggregation survey disclosed a higher prevalence of idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis in the family of patients with idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis than in the control group. Epithelial atrophy, patchy absence of melanocytes and melanin, flattening of the rete pegs, and basket weave hyperkeratosis were the most prominent histologic findings of idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis. Minigrafts of normal skin implanted in idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis lesions did not modify the achromic defects, whereas intralesional triamcinolone with or without grafts improved the appearance of these lesions.\r"

In addition, the speed and ease with which this procedure can be performed allow successful treatment of many lesions in a single outpatient session.

The laser must be used only in selected instances where other therapies have not been fruitful, such as congenital port-wine stains or recalcitrant warts. Significant scarring is a potential sequela of the second degree burns produced by argon or carbon dioxide laser surgery, and is particularly a risk for children. Elective laser surgery, therefore, should be deferred until a child would be capable of cooperating fully with postoperative wound care. Parents must be appropriately informed about expectations for cure in certain diseases which may be only partially remedied. For instance, congenital melanocytic nevi may be improved, but are incompletely removed by laser surgery. Also, dramatic improvements in dynamic diseases such as adenoma sebaceum may represent only a temporary interlude.\r"

After initial noninvasive evaluation, 11 patients were referred for coronary angiography and the remaining 89 patients had surgery without further cardiac studies. Fifteen patients (17%) had a postoperative myocardial infarction, one of which was fatal. Of these 15 patients, 14 had thallium redistribution and 3 had positive ST segment depression during stress testing. Among the many variables tested, the presence of redistribution on serial dipyridamole-thallium images was the most significant predictor of serious cardiac events. All 11 patients who had coronary angiography had both redistribution and multivessel coronary artery disease. Four of these 11 patients died during follow-up and 6 had coronary artery bypass surgery. It is concluded that dipyridamole-thallium imaging has significant prognostic utility in predicting postoperative myocardial infarction and death in patients with severe peripheral vascular disease, and is superior to exercise testing or clinical variables in determining cardiac risk. The odds for a serious cardiac event were 23 times greater in a patient with thallium redistribution than in a patient without redistribution, strongly suggesting that myocardial imaging may be used as a primary screening test before elective vascular surgery.\r"

Before surgery, 42 patients had reciprocating tachycardia and 12 had atrial fibrillation. The principal operative procedure was endocardial incision in 42 patients, endocardial cryoablation in 2 patients and epicardial cryoablation without dissection of the atrioventricular (AV) fat pad in 1 patient. Two patients had perioperative complications. One patient had bleeding that necessitated reoperation, and one had a right cerebral stroke with subsequent clearing of neurologic deficit. At postoperative electrophysiologic study, only the patient who underwent epicardial cryoablation had conduction over an accessory connection. Two others had intermittent delta waves in the early postoperative period but no accessory connection conduction at electrophysiologic study. During a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, the patient with ineffective cryoablation had recurrent orthodromic tachycardia, and one other patient had late recurrence of delta waves without arrhythmias. Four other patients had frequent palpitation, which was caused by premature ventricular complexes in three and sinus tachycardia in one. Seventeen patients had occasional \"skipped beats\" without recurrence of tachyarrhythmias. Twelve of 13 patients whose arrhythmias limited employment before surgery returned to work after surgery. By actuarial analysis at 1, 2 and 3 years, all patients were alive and 98% were free from tachyarrhythmias. Surgical correction of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome provides excellent long-term results with low morbidity. Patients who are disabled by arrhythmias return to work after successful surgery. Delta waves may persist or recur without return of arrhythmias. Minor postoperative episodes of palpitation are common and do not correlate with tachyarrhythmias.\r"

To determine the incidence and possible pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for this process, the serial clinical and laboratory data of 62 patients with the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were analyzed. During a mean follow-up period of 8 years (range 2 to 21), 5 patients (Group A) developed left ventricular hypokinesia, whereas the remaining 57 patients (Group B) continued to exhibit the clinical and laboratory findings of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Three patients developed a dilated left ventricle with generalized hypokinesia; two other patients had segmental left ventricular wall motion abnormalities. None of these five patients who developed left ventricular hypokinesia had fixed coronary artery disease. The mean age, sex, mean duration of follow-up, presence of coronary myocardial bridges and angina pectoris, and an interventricular gradient were all similar in Groups A and B. Midventricular obliteration was seen in 4 (80%) of the 5 patients in Group A and in 4 (7%) of the 57 patients in Group B (p less than 0.001). Findings from this study reveal that segmental or generalized left ventricular hypokinesia can develop in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the absence of fixed coronary artery disease. Such hypokinesia can occur after an acute myocardial infarction or it can develop gradually without clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of infarction. Patients with the mid-ventricular obliteration variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are at a higher risk of developing segmental or diffuse left ventricular hypokinesia.\r"

  ".W": "Exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia is a frequent feature in patients with coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and angiographic characteristics of 269 patients who complained of chest pain during an exercise test (group I) with those of 204 who developed exercise-induced silent myocardial ischemia (group II). Group I patients more frequently had anginal symptoms of class III and IV of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society than did group II patients, who had milder symptoms (p less than 0.001). The only angiographic difference observed between the two groups was a slightly but significantly higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in group II patients (p less than 0.05), who also showed a longer exercise duration (p less than 0.01) with a higher heart rate-systolic pressure product (p less than 0.01) and more pronounced ST segment depression at peak exercise (p less than 0.001). Moreover, ventricular ectopic beats during exercise were more frequently observed in group II patients (p less than 0.05). Coronary bypass surgery was performed in 45% of patients of group I and in 24% of patients of group II (p less than 0.05). Survival curves of medically treated patients did not show any statistically significant difference between the two groups. Thus, although patients with a defective anginal warning system may have more pronounced signs of myocardial ischemia and a greater incidence of ventricular arrhythmias during exercise, their long-term prognosis is not different from that of patients who are stopped by angina from the activity that is inducing myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Thallium-201 imaging has been utilized to estimate myocardial salvage after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. However, results from recent animal studies have suggested that as a result of reactive hyperemia and delayed necrosis, thallium-201 imaging may overestimate myocardial salvage. To determine whether early overestimation of salvage occurs in humans, intracoronary thallium-201 scans 1 hour after thrombolytic therapy were compared with intravenous thallium-201 scans obtained approximately 10 and 100 days after myocardial infarction in 29 patients. In 10 patients with angiographic evidence of coronary reperfusion, immediate improvement in thallium defects and no interim clinical events, there was no change in imaging in the follow-up studies. Of nine patients with coronary reperfusion but no initial improvement of perfusion defects, none showed worsening of defects in the follow-up images. Six of these patients demonstrated subsequent improvement at either 10 or 100 days after infarction. Seven of 10 patients with neither early evidence of reperfusion nor improvement in perfusion defects had improvement of infarct-related perfusion defects, and none showed worsening. In conclusion, serial scanning at 10 and 100 days after infarction in patients with no subsequent clinical events showed no worsening of the perfusion image compared with images obtained in acute studies. Therefore, there is no evidence that thallium-201 imaging performed early in patients with acute myocardial infarction overestimates improvement.\r"

  ".W": "Unipolar and bipolar floating atrial electrograms from 58 pacemaker patients were recorded and compared. Twenty-four floating unipolar electrodes and 29 floating bipolar electrodes were used at mid-right atrial level and five orthogonal atrial J leads within the right atrial appendage. Each signal was analyzed in the time domain: peak to peak deflection of P wave and QRS complex, duration of P wave and QRS complex and slew rate; and in the frequency domain: maximum of the energy spectrum and frequency at which a decrease of 3 dB from the maximal amplitude occurred. Atrial P (1.31 +/- 0.94 mV, mean +/- SD) and QRS (1.0 +/- 0.56 mV) waves from unipolar floating electrodes were comparable, whereas they were significantly different from bipolar floating electrodes (1.15 +/- 0.77 mV and 0.25 +/- 0.39 mV). Amplitudes of P waves from orthogonal J leads were largest (3.1 +/- 2.6 mV) and QRS complexes (0.21 +/- 0.13 mV) smallest. The P waves had the highest frequency content (17.1 +/- 19.4 Hz). It is concluded that atrial electrograms from orthogonal electrodes (bipolar or orthogonal J) offer superior sensing characteristics because of the large amplitude P wave and discriminating power between P and QRS waves (P/QRS voltage 15:1). An orthogonal J lead can thus be used for P synchronous pacing at the atrial level, whereas an orthogonal ventricular lead can be used for rate-response pacing systems.\r"

In this study, Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate the pattern of left ventricular diastolic filling in 38 subjects: 18 treated hypertensive patients (blood pressure 141 +/- 17/83 +/- 10 mm Hg, mean +/- SD) without other coronary risk factors and 20 risk-free normotensive subjects of similar age (47 +/- 10 and 49 +/- 13 years, respectively). Peak velocity of late left ventricular filling due to the atrial contraction was greater in hypertensive compared with normotensive subjects (69 +/- 14 versus 52 +/- 13 cm/s; p less than 0.001). Peak velocity of late filling was significantly greater in hypertensive versus normotensive subjects in those aged 50 years or younger and those older than age 50 (65 +/- 12 versus 50 +/- 11; p less than 0.01 and 75 +/- 15 versus 56 +/- 15 cm/s; p less than 0.05, respectively). In hypertensive subjects, peak velocity of late filling did not correlate with routine indexes of hypertensive heart disease (including posterior wall thickness and left ventricular mass), systolic and diastolic blood pressure or duration of hypertension. These results indicate that increased velocity of late left ventricular filling may be independent of left ventricular hypertrophy and persist despite effective blood pressure control.\r"

These structures were observed in 323 (68%) of the hearts, and their frequency was similar in male (72%) and female (65%) subjects. Neither the frequency nor the location varied appreciably with age. Among the 323 hearts with prominent left ventricular trabeculations, 172 (53%) exhibited 2 or more; thus, the total number of trabeculations was 582. Of these 582 trabeculations, 493 (85%) were septoparietal bundles that inserted into both the free wall and the septum. Trabeculations also were observed between two points on the ventricular septum in 37 (6%) of the hearts and between two points along the free wall in 36 (6%). Less common patterns included trabeculations between the ventricular septum and the posteromedial papillary muscle in 10 hearts (2%), the ventricular septum and the anterolateral papillary muscle in 2, the free wall and the posteromedial papillary muscle in 2, the two papillary muscles in 1 and the apex and the ventricular septum in 1. Accordingly, prominent left ventricular trabeculations are considered to be common variants of the normal human heart. Their size, shape and location may lead to their being misinterpreted, possibly as mural thrombi, by two-dimensional echocardiography.\r"

Cellular intimal proliferation occurred in infants as young as 2 months, but it increased markedly between ages 7 to 9 and 10 to 12 months, and the increased obstruction was associated with a lower mean percent arterial medial thickness in patients older than 10 months than was found in younger patients. Early generalized arterial dilation appeared without the intimal fibrosis and dilation lesions characteristic of classical grade III and IV pulmonary vascular disease. Intimal abnormalities increased with age and pulmonary artery pressure, but mean percent arterial medial thickness was inversely related to mean pulmonary artery pressure (r = -0.5; p less than 0.0001). Nine patients survived intracardiac repair and six did not. Five of the patients who died were of similar age (12 months or less), had similar preoperative hemodynamic and pulmonary vascular abnormalities compared with the survivors and died after a clinical course compatible with pulmonary vascular disease. The findings emphasize that potential structural reversibility is not synonymous with \"operability.\" Further studies are indicated on the function of the excessively muscularized pulmonary vascular bed of such infants.\r"

  ".W": "Closed chest catheter ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) junction has been performed with direct current or laser energy. The effect of 750 kHz radiofrequency energy on ablation of the AV junction was evaluated in 13 dogs. The radiofrequency energy was generated from an electrosurgical generator in the bipolar mode. The radiofrequency output was delivered between two distal electrodes (bipolar ablation) in eight dogs, and between the distal electrode and an external patch electrode (unipolar ablation) in another five dogs at varying power (watts) but with a constant pulse duration of 10 seconds. Complete AV block was achieved in 11 dogs and second degree AV block in 2. During the 4 to 7 day follow-up period, complete AV block persisted in 9 of the 11 dogs with initial complete heart block. The other two had return of AV conduction; one had persistent 2:1 AV block and the other had persistent first degree AV block. Of the two dogs with initial second degree AV block, one developed complete AV block, the other had resumption of 1:1 AV conduction with a normal PR interval. Energy was delivered in 1 to 13 applications per dog. One hundred to 700 J per application was delivered with bipolar ablation and 10 to 100 J with unipolar ablation. There was no damage to the catheter unless the catheter was repeatedly used in excess of 1,500 J of total energy. Ventricular arrhythmias were not observed. Pathologic examination showed well delineated coagulation necrosis at the AV junction without surrounding hemorrhage or mural thrombus. Microscopic findings consisted of necrosis with cell infiltration in the periphery of necrosis. Most injuries involved the AV node, the approaches to the AV node and the penetrating bundle. In conclusion, catheter ablation of the AV junction with radiofrequency energy is safe. It can effectively induce discrete areas of necrosis and produce various degrees of AV block. In addition, ablation by radiofrequency energy has distinct advantages as compared with catheter ablation with direct current or laser energy.\r"

  ".U": "87110279\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether alpha- or beta-adrenergic influences directly modulate the rate of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia occurring 24 hours after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Chloralose-anesthetized, open chest dogs (n = 41) with ventricular tachycardia were studied. The left anterior descending artery was cannulated distally. Neither intracoronary saline solution nor phenylephrine (0.3 to 12 micrograms) changed the rate of ventricular tachycardia; however, isoproterenol (0.01 to 10 micrograms) produced dose-dependent increases in the rate. In six dogs, metoprolol, 5 mg given intravenously, slowed ventricular tachycardia from 174 +/- 10 (mean +/- SE) to 140 +/- 17 beats/min (p less than 0.05). This was accompanied by decreases in mean arterial pressure from 106 +/- 7 to 95 +/- 8 mm Hg, cardiac output from 2.6 +/- 0.3 to 1.6 +/- 0.3 liters/min and prolongation of atrioventricular conduction from 134 +/- 10 to 189 +/- 29 ms (all p less than 0.05) during atrial pacing at a cycle length of 300 ms. In 10 dogs, metoprolol (0.5 mg) given intracoronary, a dose that shifted the isoproterenol dose-response curve to the right, slowed ventricular tachycardia from 174 +/- 7.2 to 140 +/- 9.7 beats/min (p less than 0.05) without hemodynamic changes. Additional metoprolol (4.5 mg) given intravenously produced hemodynamic alterations, but ventricular tachycardia did not slow further. Therefore, beta- but not alpha-adrenergic influences control the rate of ventricular tachycardia occurring 24 hours after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Furthermore, beta-adrenergic blockade slows ventricular tachycardia solely by a direct electrophysiologic effect on the tachycardia foci and not indirectly as a result of hemodynamic effects.\r"

  ".W": "The functional consequences of a transmural gradient of metabolism in the heart were studied in 19 dogs. The technique of retrograde blood flow diversion after coronary occlusion was used to deplete the ischemic myocardium of blood flow. Blood flow was uniformly and equally depleted in all layers, averaging 0.044 ml/min per g. With oxygen supply a controlled variable, transmural differences in metabolic demand can be addressed. In groups of dogs severe myocardial ischemia was induced for periods of 20 to 90 minutes. No necrosis was noted after 20 minutes of ischemia. Beginning at 30 minutes of blood flow depletion, necrosis progressed from the endocardium toward the epicardium in a \"wave front\" pattern. At 90 minutes of ischemia, approximately 70% of the area at risk was necrotic. Thus, the relative vulnerability of the endocardium as compared with the epicardium is due to nonflow factors, and probably dictated by transmural differences in metabolic activity. It would appear that myocardial metabolism as compared with blood flow occupies a primary and overriding role during the first 20 minutes of ischemia. Furthermore, differences in transmural metabolism also dictate subendocardial vulnerability for ischemic periods greater than 20 minutes, irrespective of blood flow. The role of blood flow in these events may be to modulate the rate of the transmural wave front of progressing necrosis after 20 minutes of ischemia.\r"

The mean age was 75 +/- 11 years (range 38 to 91) and 35 patients were more than 80 years old. Most of the patients were severely disabled; 66 were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV, 27 had syncopal attacks and 21 had severe angina pectoris. Because of unacceptably high surgical risk or contraindication to thoracic surgery, 42 patients could not be considered for valve replacement. Other patients either were in a category of high operative risk or refused the surgical intervention. Valvuloplasty was performed by way of the femoral route (82 patients) or the brachial route (10 patients). Catheters of size 15, 18 and 20 mm were successively placed across the aortic valve and three inflations were usually done with each of them, lasting 80 seconds on average, until a decrease in peak to peak systolic pressure gradient to 40 mm Hg or less was attained, a result considered satisfactory. The inflated balloons were not totally occlusive in most cases and clinical tolerance of inflation was good. Valvuloplasty resulted in a reduction of mean systolic gradient from 75 +/- 26 to 30 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); the final gradient was less than 40 mm Hg in 78 patients. Mean calculated aortic valve area increased from 0.49 +/- 0.17 to 0.93 +/- 0.36 cm2 (p less than 0.001). Immediately after the procedure, ejection fraction increased from 48 +/- 16 to 51 +/- 16% (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No patient had nonsustained (greater than 5 beats) or sustained ventricular tachycardia by history or baseline 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Sequential stimulation studies using up to three extra-stimuli were performed after administration of procainamide, quinidine and disopyramide on different days. Proarrhythmic response was defined as induction of one or more of the following: sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia; sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; ventricular fibrillation; reproducibly inducible nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. During 55 antiarrhythmic drug trials (24 of procainamide, 21 of quinidine, 10 of disopyramide) in the 24 patients, 6 patients had a proarrhythmic response: sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in 3, ventricular fibrillation in 2, nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in 1. Thus, 11% of drug trials resulted in a proarrhythmic response and 25% of patients had a proarrhythmic response to one of the drugs tested. A proarrhythmic response to one drug did not predict a similar response to another drug of the same class. The 6 patients with a proarrhythmic response did not differ significantly from the other 18 patients with regard to underlying heart disease, electrocardiographic or baseline 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic characteristics; however, they did have a higher incidence of digoxin usage (p less than 0.02), a shorter baseline right ventricular effective refractory period (p less than 0.01) and a smaller increment in effective refractory period during antiarrhythmic drug testing (p = 0.06).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At baseline, all patients had ventricular tachycardia inducible by programmed stimulation. After amiodarone loading (935 +/- 271 mg for 16 +/- 7 days), efficacy was determined by a programmed stimulation criterion (ventricular tachycardia no longer inducible or less than or equal to 15 beats) and two Holter monitoring criteria (Holter I = greater than or equal to 85% reduction of ventricular premature complexes and abolition of couplets and triplets in 64 patients who had greater than or equal to 10 ventricular premature complexes/h or couplets or triplets or both before therapy; Holter II = abolition of triplets in 41 patients who had triplets before therapy).

There were 16 recurrences or sudden deaths during the entire follow-up period (19 +/- 19 months). Arrhythmia-free survival rates at 24 months of patients with efficacy and inefficacy by each criterion, respectively, were 90 and 78% by programmed stimulation, 84 and 62% by Holter criterion I (p less than 0.05) and 73 and 50% by Holter criterion II (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Diltiazem, a calcium channel antagonist that slows atrioventricular conduction, was administered to 16 patients who failed to achieve adequate rate control on low level exercise testing despite digoxin therapy. Therapeutic response to diltiazem was assessed with submaximal and maximal exercise tests and 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. During the diltiazem treatment phase, ventricular response at rest diminished (96 +/- 17 versus 69 +/- 10 beats/min, p less than 0.001) as did rate during submaximal exercise (155 +/- 28 versus 116 +/- 26, p less than 0.001), maximal exercise (163 +/- 14 versus 133 +/- 26, p less than 0.001) and average ventricular response during 24 hour monitoring (87 +/- 13 versus 69 +/- 10, p less than 0.001). Rate at rest decreased 26 +/- 15% and submaximal exercise rate diminished 24 +/- 12%. Thirteen (81%) of the 16 patients exhibited at least 15% slowing of rate at rest and during submaximal exercise. Eleven patients (69%) reported alleviation of symptoms. There was no change in serum digoxin levels during diltiazem treatment (1.3 +/- 0.5 versus 1.3 +/- 0.6 ng/ml, p = NS). On withdrawal of diltiazem, ventricular response returned to baseline values. Diltiazem is an effective agent for control of ventricular response, both at rest and during exercise, in digoxin-treated patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.\r"

In all patients, clinical and electrocardiographic findings were suggestive but nonspecific for myocardial involvement. Two patients had cardiac tamponade and three had pericardial effusion. In three patients, the echocardiographic diagnosis made it possible to plan specific therapy. Clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic aspects are discussed. A two-dimensional echocardiographic examination should be performed in all patients when cardiac metastatic involvement is suspected from clinical electrocardiographic findings, because the in vivo diagnosis of such a condition may have important therapeutic implications for such patients.\r"

  ".W": "A case of paroxysmal bradycardia- and tachycardia-dependent atrioventricular (AV) block is described in a patient with right bundle branch block. The His bundle recordings demonstrated the site of the AV block to be distal to the His bundle recording site (probably in the left bundle branch). Whereas AV block distal to the His bundle occurred at an atrial paced cycle length of 700 ms, intact ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction was present up to a ventricular paced cycle length of 400 ms. Resumption of AV conduction was dependent on a critical HH or RH (in case of escapes) interval. These findings suggest that the bradycardia-dependent block is related to a time-dependent decrease in the amplitude of the current intensity of the proximal segment during late diastole. Spontaneous diastolic depolarization during late diastole resulted in impaired anterograde (AV) conduction but facilitated retrograde (VA) conduction. These findings are consistent with experimental \"in vitro\" observation in the sucrose gap model of AV block.\r"

  ".W": "In our previous studies we reported that lymphocytes from patients with asthma spontaneously produce histamine-releasing factor (HRF) in vitro. In an effort to examine whether spontaneous HRF production (SpHRF) by lymphocytes from patients with asthma is related to the state of bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR), 20 patients with mild to severe asthma were studied. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured alone in a serum-free medium for 24 hours, and culture supernatant was assayed for HRF activity in two separate histamine-release tests with autologous basophils and normal basophils from known healthy donors. BHR was measured as bronchial reactivity to inhaled histamine and was expressed as a provocation concentration of histamine required to induce a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). The result of this study demonstrated that lymphocyte supernatant from all patients with asthma released significant amount of histamine from both autologous and normal basophils. Very high histamine release was usually induced by lymphocyte supernatant from severely ill patients who had PC20 less than 2 mg/ml. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the magnitude of the SpHRF significantly correlated (r = -0.86; p less than 0.001) with PC20. Since mast cell- and basophil-derived mediators have been implicated in the pathogenesis of BHR, high correlation between PC20 and SpHRF by lymphocytes suggests that the latter may contribute to the development of BHR. Further studies are required to disclose the exact relationship between SpHRF and BHR.\r"

In RAST-inhibition experiments with three different sera, a cross-reactivity between mugwort pollen and coriander could be demonstrated.

Their major components comprise antigen 5, hyaluronidase, and phospholipase A1. The homologous venom proteins share very similar biochemical properties. With the exception of antigen 5 and phospholipase of V. squamosa, they also have very similar antigenic properties. The venom proteins of V. squamosa and V. vulgaris were equally effective in inducing secondary antibody responses in mice that were primed with V. squamosa proteins. No cross-reaction of V. squamosa and V. vulgaris venom proteins was detected on immunodiffusion with specific mouse antisera. A very weak cross-reaction was detected by inhibition of ELISA, and a moderate cross-reaction was detected by direct ELISA. The varying cross-reactivity is a consequence of the different sensitivities of the assays. The sensitivity of the direct ELISA is apparently caused by a greater enhancement of the binding of low-affinity antibodies for the solid-phase antigen than that of high-affinity antibodies. Most untreated yellow jacket-sensitive patients tested had about tenfold higher levels of IgG specific for V. vulgaris proteins than those specific for V. squamosa proteins. This pattern of antibody specificity can be accounted for on the basis of cross-reactivity of these yellow jackets as suggested by the results with the mouse system.\r"

  ".W": "Eustachian tube obstruction (ETO) has been reported to develop more frequently in subjects with allergic rhinitis (AR) than in subjects without AR after a single intranasal histamine challenge. The present double-blind crossover study was designed to confirm and extend this observation. In a pilot study, nebulization was demonstrated to be superior to insufflation in provoking ETO. Five subjects with AR and five subjects without AR were repeatedly challenged intranasally with nebulized normal saline or increasing doses of histamine (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5, and 10 mg per nostril). Subjects with AR were selected on the basis of AR symptoms and IgE antibodies to allergens and were challenged in their nonallergy seasons. ETO was assessed by nine-step tympanometry and nasal airway resistance by anterior rhinomanometry before and after each challenge. Of nine ears in subjects with AR, ETO developed in five ears at 0.1 mg and in four ears at 0.5 mg. In contrast, in 10 ears of subjects without AR, ETO developed in two ears at 5 mg but did not develop in eight ears at doses as large as 10 mg. This test effectively discriminated subjects with AR from subjects without AR, groups that could not be similarly differentiated by nasal or skin responsiveness to histamine challenge. Saline challenges provoked ETO in three of nine ears of subjects with AR and in one of 10 ears of subjects without AR. These data suggest a hyperresponsiveness of the nasopharyngeal and/or tubal mucosa to histamine in subjects with AR that may predispose these patients to otitis media with effusion.\r"

  ".U": "87110313\r", 
  ".W": "Intradermal injections of isolated mast cell granules (MCGs), as well as solubilized high-molecular-weight (HMW) (greater than 10,000 daltons) and low-molecular-weight (LMW) (10,000 greater than MW greater than 500 daltons) fractionated granule constituents, can produce inflammatory responses termed late-phase reactions (LPRs). The identity and mechanism of action of various inflammatory factor(s) contained within these fractions is incompletely established. Since rat LPRs are neutrophil-dependent responses, we analyzed the inherent neutrophil chemoattractant potential of HMW and LMW granule fractions using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber. Although both HMW and LMW fractions attracted rat neutrophils, the LMW fraction was less active at equivalent protein concentrations. Checkerboard analysis demonstrated that the HMW fraction enhanced random migration of neutrophils, indicating that the HMW fraction contains factors that are primarily chemokinetic. To analyze further the HMW fraction, solubilized MCGs were sequentially fractionated with XM300 (MW greater than 300,000 daltons), and YM100 (300,000 greater than MW greater than 100,000 daltons), XM50 (100,000 greater than MW greater than 50,000 daltons), and YM10 (50,000 greater than MW greater than 10,000 daltons) ultrafiltration membranes. This process revealed that most in vivo inflammation-provoking activity as well as the in vitro chemoattractant activity resided in the XM300 and YM100 retentate fractions. Two of the major constituents of the HMW fraction, heparin and chymase, were evaluated for their contribution to the chemoattraction. Purified MCG heparin did not evoke neutrophil migratory responses in vitro or in vivo. Sepharose 4B chromatography of solubilized MCG demonstrated a peak of inflammation-provoking activity beginning at the void volume and tapering off near the 400,000 MW range. This in vivo activity was clearly separable from the chymase activity and represents the HMW inflammatory factors. These results demonstrate that both HMW and LMW granule fractions contain inflammatory activities capable of producing LPR in vivo and suggest that enhancement of neutrophil migration at sites of mast cell degranulation is one mechanism of action.\r"

The individuals demonstrating positive immediate skin tests included patients with urticaria, angioedema, asthma, and/or rhinitis, as well as five of 34 normal control subjects. Most skin test positive individuals had a history of local fungal infection and clinical signs suggestive of fungal infection. By use of Trichophyton tonsurans extract linked to Sepharose as the immunosorbent, it was possible to measure IgE antibodies in 26/30 sera from skin test positive individuals. With strongly positive sera, RAST bound up to 30% of the radiolabeled anti-IgE added. The results confirm that most skin test positive individuals have IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to Trichophyton. These observations support the older view that absorption of dermatophyte allergen through the skin should be considered as a possible cause of allergic disease.\r"

Albuterol or placebo (180 micrograms) were administered by metered-dose inhaler 20 minutes before a 10-minute exposure to SO2 or clean air during moderate exercise on a treadmill at an exercise level that by itself did not produce exercise-induced bronchospasm. Pulmonary functions (FEV1 and total respiratory resistance [RT]) were measured before the drug, after the drug, and after exposure to SO2 or clean air. Albuterol treatment produced significant bronchodilation and also prevented SO2-induced bronchoconstriction. Following SO2 inhalation after placebo, FEV1 decreased 15% (p less than 0.02) and RT increased 50% (p less than 0.03). Following SO2 inhalation after albuterol treatment, neither FEV1 or RT changed significantly. We conclude that albuterol, a beta 2-agonist, inhibits SO2-induced bronchoconstriction. This result suggests that the adrenergic nervous system or mast cell degranulation are involved in SO2-induced bronchoconstriction.\r"

Rats in each exposure group were sacrificed after 10 exposures or rested for 12 days and either sacrificed or received a 6-hour TMA challenge at their initial exposure levels and sacrificed at 24 hours. At each sacrifice, serum antibody to radiolabeled trimellityl rat serum albumin (RSA-TM) was measured by an ammonium sulfate technique, and lung pathology was determined. After 10 days of exposure, external hemorrhagic lung foci were directly related to the exposure concentration of TMA. Serum antibody binding of RSA-TM correlated with exposure concentration, hemorrhagic lung foci, and lung weight. There was healing of lung lesions 12 days after exposure with a return of lung lesions only 18 hours after the 6-hour inhalation challenge. A correlation between serum antibody to RSA-TM, hemorrhagic foci, and lung weight existed after challenge. This model clarifies two clinical entities observed in exposed workers, the late respiratory systemic and the pulmonary disease-anemia syndromes.\r"

The greater frequency of symptoms during the albuterol regimen was increasingly apparent more than 4 hours after albuterol doses and was greatest between 4 and 8 A.M. Albuterol transiently inhibited histamine-induced bronchospasm to a much greater degree than did theophylline, and combining the drugs produced at least an additive effect. The effect of albuterol was completely absent by 4 hours, however, whereas that of theophylline persisted. Thus, in spite of greater acute effects on the airways, the transient duration of effect from inhaled albuterol appears to limit its usefulness as maintenance therapy, especially for patients with nocturnal symptoms.\r"

Physiologic, psychosocial, and environmental data were also recorded. In addition, Pfeiffer's Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale, Face-Hand Test, and sensory screening were completed. Among the 89 subjects, 11 were found to be sundowners, a prevalence rate of one in eight in the facility. No clear pattern of behaviors evolved but sundowners were found to increase restless and verbal behavior as evening approached. Sundowners were more likely to be demented, with greater mental impairment and organic involvement than nonsundowners. Among physiologic factors, odor of urine, being awakened frequently on the evening shift, and fewer medical diagnoses were significantly associated with sundowning. Significant psychosocial factors were current room residence of less than one month, more recent admission to the facility, and higher evening levels of confusion. No environmental factors were related.\r"

Hypothyroidism (TSH greater than 10 microU/mL with a low T4 and FT4I or clinical findings) was present in 7.8% (nine of 116) of male inpatients compared to only 0.7% of male ambulatory controls (P less than 0.01). Only a few women were studied but 17% (two of 12) were hypothyroid compared to 2.4% of ambulatory elderly women. Three of the hypothyroid inpatients had no clinical clue to their hypothyroidism. Further, decreased thyroid reserve or subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH greater than 10 microU/mL with a normal T4 and FT4I and no overt clinical findings), a condition which may lead to overt hypothyroidism, was more common in male inpatients (4.3%) than in male ambulatory controls (1.8% [P less than 0.01]). Thus, a clearly elevated serum TSH (greater than 10 microU/mL) was more common in inpatient (12.1%) than in ambulatory (2.4%) elderly men (P less than 0.01). Four inpatients and nine ambulatory controls had an elevated T4 and FT4I, but in only one (0.8%) inpatient and one (0.6%) control was a final diagnosis of hyperthyroidism made; the others had no clinical findings and a normal or low T3 and FT3I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study compared the frequency of abnormal DST results in three groups of elderly inpatients: depressed/not demented; demented/not depressed; and depressed and demented. Two geropsychiatrists independently evaluated 33 patients for symptoms of depression and/or dementia and then assigned each patient to one of the three groups. Subjects in the demented/not depressed group had a significantly larger proportion of abnormal DSTs (P less than .01), and the mean postdexamethasone, 4 PM blood cortisol level of the demented/not depressed group was significantly greater than the means of the other two groups (P less than .005). In this sample, the DST was more likely to identify dementia than depression. Until further investigations clarify the parameters of DST use in the elderly, the diagnosis of depression and dementia should continue to be determined by sensitive interpretation of clinical findings, history, and other diagnostic tests.\r"

While the elderly patients attained a lower peak exercise intensity on entry and on completion of the exercise protocol, they obtained a similar relative training benefit as the younger patients. Peak exercise intensity increased 68% in each group and submaximal (five METS) heart rate-blood pressure product decreased 27% in the older patients and 26% in the younger patients. Rate of entry into our program was substantially lower in the elderly patient group, 19% v 57% in younger patients (P less than 0.001) despite a similar inhospital recruiting effort. Thus, although elderly coronary patients obtain similar training benefits as younger patients, they are less likely to participate in a program designed to decrease cardiac disability.\r"

In order to define characteristics of decisions to adopt palliative care, including those factors influencing whether a particular patient received palliation, the frequency of this therapeutic posture, and the duration of this treatment period, we performed a retrospective analytical survey of all patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) treated at Duke University Medical Center over the past ten years. Logistic regression analysis identified several potentially significant variables influencing the decision to adopt palliative care. Using a stepwise logistic model, the only independent variable associated with adoption of palliative therapy was initial treatment off a research protocol (P = 0.0001). Initial treatment off a research protocol was itself associated with older age (P = 0.0002), nonspontaneous onset of leukemia (P = 0.005), female sex (P = 0.003), and the absence of dependent children (P = 0.01) when examined by multivariate logistic regression. The palliative treatment interval was defined as the time between the discontinuation of aggressive treatment and the patient's death. Fifty-one percent, 119 of 235 patients, received palliative care; of these, 47% were palliated from the time of diagnosis and 53% were palliated only after receiving remission induction therapy. The median duration for the palliative care period was 46 days (50 days for the initially palliated group, 24 days for the group receiving aggressive therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All four risk factors (age, sex, obesity, and symptomatic status) were statistically significant and independent predictors of impaired respiration in sleep in the elderly.\r"

Thirty-four percent of the patients without risk factors and 62% of those in the high-risk group were found to have significant abnormalities on chest roentgenograms (P less than 0.05). Postoperative complications occurred in 20% of patients in the high-risk group compared to 11% complication-rate in patients without clinical risk factors. The difference is not statistically significant. The prevalence of abnormal preoperative chest roentgenograms among those over the age of 70 years (49%) was not significantly different from the prevalence in those between the ages of 60 and 70 years (59%); however, the incidence of major postoperative complications was significantly higher in the older group (17 v 4%, P less than 0.01). Because of the substantial prevalence of abnormal chest roentgenograms and postoperative complications, it is concluded that in the elderly preoperative patients, in particular those over the age of 70 years, chest roentgenograms should be done on all patients regardless of clinical history.\r"

Thirty percent of the same 207 patients had no response to an anergy panel of skin test antigens that included candida, mumps, and trichophyton. Nonresponders to tuberculin and the anergy panel had significantly higher one-year mortality rates compared to responders (44 v 20%, P = 0.001). Tuberculin-positivity among the 770 employees working in these facilities was 43%; 12 (4%) had a booster response. A survey of 29 randomly selected long-term care facilities in the Boston area indicated that all had a policy for pre-employment screening of employees, but less than 50% had a policy for patients and only one institution used two-stage testing. Routine tuberculin testing is recommended for long-term care facilities and the two-stage method is preferable in institutions with adequate resources.\r"

At this meeting, the project was explained in detail using a packet of promotional information which included a project summary, a listing of project staff and their qualifications, and letters of support from influential organizations. A total of 61 eligible facilities were contacted in order to achieve a group of 53 participating homes with approximately 5000 beds. One hundred percent cooperation was achieved from all strata except small (less than or equal to 50 beds) proprietary comprehensive care facilities, and homes with both comprehensive and domiciliary beds.

These differences were not significant at any interval. In both groups ulcer relapse was independent of sex, smoking habit, and alcohol and coffee consumption, whereas a history longer than 5 years was significantly related to a higher probability of recurrence. No relevant clinical or biochemical side effects were encountered with either drug, but compliance rate was higher in the R group. R and S are equally effective in preventing duodenal ulcer relapse over a 1-year period of maintenance treatment, although R proved to be more effective in preventing early relapse.\r"

The following four items, of the nine studied, were significantly different between the two groups; namely, patients of stricturing form were older in age, had longer time intervals from the onset of disease to disappearance of subjective symptoms and to normalization of white blood cell count and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and showed an increase in 1-h erythrocyte sedimentation rate on day 5 or earlier of the disease. Our observations indicate that the age and 1-h erythrocyte sedimentation rate might be useful indicators to differentiate the stricturing and transient forms early after the onset of the disease.\r"

The recurrence rate, calculated by actuarial methods, was 62.2% after 10 years and 86.4% after 15 years. The site of recurrence was clearly related to the initial location of disease (p less than 0.001). However, of the various clinical, pathological, and surgical factors studied, only the preoperative history correlated directly with recurrence (p less than 0.05). The prospective study evaluated the influence on recurrence of microscopic lesions at grossly free margins of ileocecal resection. Twenty-two consecutive patients, operated on for Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum from 6 to 34 months previously (average 24 months), were studied. From the histological grading previously established, recurrence was independent of involvement at both proximal and distal section lines. Therefore, we recommend conservative resection to obtain only grossly uninvolved margins.\r"

Analysis of all 141 ESR determinations in all 77 patients showed a highly significant correlation between mean ESR and clinical activity score (r = 0.54, p less than 0.001). Analysis of 133 ESR determinations in these 77 patients when their disease activity was either mild, moderate, or severe showed some significant differences among certain disease categories. The highest mean ESRs were in patients with the most extensive colon involvement (Crohn's colitis 40.7 +/- 3.3, universal ulcerative colitis 31.0 +/- 3.9), whereas the lowest mean ESRs were in patients with the most limited disease (ulcerative proctitis and proctosigmoiditis 19.2 +/- 2.1). The rate of increase in ESR with progressively increasing clinical activity from mild to moderate was the same in all disease categories, with the exception of Crohn's disease limited to the small bowel (ileitis or jejunoileitis), in which the ESR was relatively unchanged in a small sample of patients. By the time clinical activity became severe, however, patients in all disease categories manifested similarly high ESRs, with the exception of ulcerative proctitis in which the ESR remained low in the single patient tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-two consecutive cases with ulcerative colitis were studied. These cases were divided by degree of severity into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe; this tripartite grouping was used as a dependent variable. As independent variables, 11 predictors were selected from among physical findings and laboratory data. By multiple regression analysis with stepwise deletion, six factors indispensable to the disease activity were selected: temperature, pulse rate, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red blood cell count, alpha 2-globulin, and number of bowel movements per day. Disease activity is predicted by using the following equation: Y = -12.168 + 0.333X1 + 0.022X2 + 0.018X3 - 0.337X4 + 0.056X5 + 0.033X6, where X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, and X6 denote temperature, pulse rate, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red blood cell count, alpha 2-globulin, and number of bowel movements per day, respectively. By applying this equation to each case, the range of activity indices is expressed as follows: mild, less than 1.52; moderate, between 1.52 and 2.44; and severe, more than 2.44.\r"

Straight withdrawal and retroflexion in the rectum of the fiberoptic instruments led to lesion detection rates of 78% and 54%, respectively. The anoscope showed 99% of lesions. Anoscopy was easily learned and required less than a minute to perform. We conclude that anoscopy should be performed in every patient undergoing fibersigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Instructions in this procedure should be provided in all training programs.\r"

This report describes one of the largest series of cases of acute failure, managed on a simple intensive supportive therapeutic regimen. One hundred fifty-eight patients with ALF were admitted to the Rajgarhia Liver Unit of the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) during the period July 1976 to December 1981. Data from 145 were completed and analyzed for this report. Of the patients, 85.4% were below the age of 40 years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.3:1. Of the 77 women in the reproductive age group, 59.7% were pregnant. All cases of ALF were secondary to viral hepatitis. Cerebral edema, bleeding, infection, and renal failure were seen in 57.2, 57.2, 39.3, and 16.5% of patients, respectively. Overall survival was 28.9% of patients. It was 33% below the age of 40 years and only 4.8% above this age. Pregnancy did not adversely affect the prognosis. Survival was related to grade of coma, being 22.8% for patients in Grade IV coma and 62% for patients in Grade I coma. In fatal cases the immediate complications resulting in death were cerebral edema (63%), bleeding (30%), renal failure (10.6%), and infection (8.7%). Presence of HBsAg, a serum bilirubin of over 20 mg%, and serum sodium less that 119 mEq/liter were indicators of poor prognosis. A simple, intensive, support therapy yielded results comparable to those reported by centers using a variety of complex therapeutic regimens.\r"

On the basis of this study, the following predisposing factors were incriminated in the epidemiology of the disease: predilection of the disease for women, obesity, hair removal by a safety razor, antiperspirants and deodorants, and local pyogenic infections distant from the axilla. Because antiperspirants do not effect transepidermal water loss of axillary skin, their potential deleterious effects are probably related to their chemical irritant effects on cut, nicked, or irritated axillary skin. Treatment of this disease will vary according to its severity. Incision and drainage are usually needed to treat the localized disease. Specific measures must also be instituted to prevent progression of the disease (eg, weight reduction, avoidance of safety razor and antiperspirants and deodorants, and control of localized pyogenic infections distant from the axilla). Management of the chronic phase of the disease is primarily excision of infected axillary skin.\r"

We now show that most oligoclonal IgG bands are directed predominantly against isolated myelin basic protein (MBP). Activity to the latter could be removed from sera or CSF by absorption with MBP but not with histone or lysozyme. The oligoclonal IgG reacted weakly with isolated proteolipid apoprotein, and lacked reactivity to myelin-associated glycoprotein. When the oligoclonal IgG activity to myelin proteins was removed from the sera by absorption with a preparation of delipidated myelin before imprint electroimmunofixation, a few bands in some sera still reacted with whole spinal cord homogenate. These results indicate that, in some sera, a part of the oligoclonal IgG was directed against non-myelin proteins or lipids. In contrast to chronic relapsing EAE, CSF oligoclonal IgG from patients with multiple sclerosis showed no reactivity against human brain homogenate, whole myelin, delipidated myelin, and MBP in imprint electroimmunofixation.\r"

  ".W": "Antigen- or mitogen-stimulated leukocytes release bone-resorbing activity into culture supernatants in vitro. Among the agents likely to be present in such supernatants are monocyte-derived tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and lymphocyte-derived tumor necrosis factor (TNF-beta) (lymphotoxin), both of which have recently been shown to stimulate bone resorption in organ culture. To identify the mechanism of action of these agents, we compared bone resorption by isolated osteoclasts with bone resorption by osteoclasts cocultured with osteoblastic cells, and with bone resorption by osteoclasts incubated with supernatants from osteoblastic cells, in the presence and absence of recombinant TNF-alpha and TNF-beta. We found that neither TNF-alpha nor TNF-beta had any significant effect on bone resorption by isolated osteoclasts, but in the presence of osteoblasts the agents caused a twofold to threefold stimulation of bone resorption. A similar degree of stimulation was achieved by supernatants from osteoblasts incubated with TNF before addition to osteoclasts, compared with supernatants to which TNF were added after osteoblast incubation. These experiments suggest that TNF-alpha and TNF-beta stimulate bone resorption through a primary effect on osteoblastic cells, which are induced by TNF to produce a factor that stimulates osteoclastic resorption. Half-maximal stimulation of resorption occurred at 1.5 X 10(-10) M and 2.5 X 10(-10) M for TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, respectively. This degree of potency is comparable to that of parathyroid hormone, the major physiologic systemic regulator of bone resorption, and suggests that the TNF may exert a significant influence on osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Human T lymphocytes carry a surface antigen, detectable by a monoclonal antifibronectin antibody, which appears to consist of 150 and 55 kd components as revealed by SDS-PAGE. After in vitro culture of the lymphocytes on a plastic substratum for 48 hr comparatively few cells (40 +/- 18% in separate individuals) express the antigen. In contrast, the vast majority of lymphocytes cultured on a collagen matrix for the same time period maintains surface expression of the antigen (76 +/- 14% in separate individuals). Conditioned media from lymphocytes on plastic contain substantial amounts of antigenicity detectable by the same antibody, whereas conditioned media from lymphocytes on collagen are devoid of such antigenicity. The expression at the cell surface of other T lymphocyte antigens (Leu-4, Leu-3, and OKT8) is identical during culture on plastic and collagen for 48 hr. Collagen does not activate the cells to DNA synthesis or expression of IL 2 receptors, and consequently the potentiation of antigen expression by this substratum cannot be attributed to a mitogenic effect. The composition of subsets of T lymphocytes and the viability of the cells are the same on plastic and collagen, which excludes that the substratum-dependent variations in antigenicity reflect selection or loss of antigen-bearing cells. Thus, substratum-dependent regulation of the expression at the cell surface appears to be a unique property of the 150/55 kd T cell surface antigen. Culture on collagen substrata augments the number of lymphocytes showing motile behavior two to four times compared with culture on plastic.\r"

Maximal C5a expression occurred when C5 was cleaved in the presence of the later-acting complement components, C6, C7, and C8. This effect was detected by using both purified components and normal human serum immunochemically depleted of C7 or C8 and reconstituted with the purified component. C6 alone was not sufficient to augment C5a expression. Subsequent incubation of C6 and C7 with C5 cleaved in the absence of the terminal components was not sufficient for C5a release. Repeated freezing and thawing of C5 cleaved in the absence of C6 and C7 produced C5a equivalent to that detected when convertase cleavage occurred in the presence of the terminal components. Mild detergent treatment of convertase-cleaved C5 was not sufficient for C5a release. We believe that these data indicate a role for the terminal complement components in the expression of both C5a antigen and function. The mechanism for this effect is not known, but it may involve conformational changes in the C5 molecule that occur during membrane attack complex formation.\r"

An i.p. but not i.v. infection resulted in a localized increase in NK/LGL cell number (a fourfold to greater than 20-fold increase) and augmentation (a 10- to 20-fold increase) of NK cell activity associated with virus-induced peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) populations. An increase in NK/LGL cell number was detected as early as 12 hr postinfection (p.i.) and peaked at 3 days p.i. with MHV. The initial LGL recruited into the peritoneal cavity at 1 to 3 days p.i. were nonadherent to plastic and were demonstrated to have an NK cell phenotype: asialo GM1+, Thy-1.2 +/-, Lyt-2.2-, and J11d-. The peak number of LGL appeared at 7 days after infection with the NK cell-resistant virus, LCMV. This LGL population had been previously demonstrated to contain cytotoxic T lymphocyte/LGL (CTL/LGL) as well as NK/LGL. During an MHV infection the number of LGL decreased between days 3 and 7 p.i., suggesting that the second wave of CTL/LGL was absent. These findings may explain the absence of a good MHV-CTL model. Virus-induced, activated NK/LGL responded to chemotactic signals by migrating in a unidirectional manner across two 5-microns pore size polycarbonate filters during 7 hr in vitro chemotaxis assays. Wash-out fluid obtained from the peritoneal cavity contained chemotactic activity for NK/LGL as well as for other cell types. We conclude that production and/or release of chemotactic factors at sites of virus replication are at least partially responsible for the accumulation of NK/LGL at these sites.\r"

Adult C57BL/6 mice are resistant to HSV-1 (HFEM strain), but are rendered highly susceptible by treatment with cyclophosphamide 24 hr prior to infection. In this model, passive transfer of 10(8) normal spleen cells or 10(7) poly I:C-treated spleen cells provided protection for 72% of the recipients. Spleen cells from NK cell-deficient beige mice similarly treated failed to engender passive protection. The phenotype of the cells responsible for transferring protection was NK1.1+, and asialo GM1+. Transfer of NK cells resulted in marked reduction of HSV titers in the livers and brains of recipients. These experiments provide direct evidence for a role for NK cells in protection against development of fatal HSV infection in mice.\r"

The serum half-life after a single i.v. injection of rHTNF was determined to be 30 +/- 2 min. Tumor-bearing mice were more susceptible to the toxic side effects of rHTNF than were normal mice. Forty-eight percent (41/86) of tumor bearing animals that received 10 micrograms rHTNF died within 48 hr after treatment compared with no deaths in 28 normal animals receiving this dose. Treatment of mice bearing either the MCA-101, -102, -105, or -106 sarcoma or the MCA-38 adenocarcinoma with rHTNF resulted in a marked necrosis of the central portion of each tumor within 24 hr. Animals bearing the weakly immunogenic tumors MCA-105, -106, and -38 experienced a reduction in average tumor area of 47% +/- 5, 46% +/- 6, and 37% +/- 11, respectively, by 3 to 4 days after treatment with rHTNF compared with pre-treatment values (p less than 0.001); increases of 79% +/- 11, 74% +/- 10, and 41% +/- 6 were seen in excipient-treated control animals over the same period. In contrast, animals bearing the non-immunogenic tumors MCA-101 and -102 experienced little if any decrease in tumor area at the doses of rHTNF used. rHTNF failed to mediate cures in animals bearing MCA-38, -101, or -102. In contrast, 67 and 28% of animals bearing MCA-105 and -106, respectively, which received 6 to 10 micrograms rHTNF were cured. Likewise, animals bearing MCA-105 and -106 sarcomas treated with 6 to 10 micrograms rHTNF had significantly increased survival compared with excipient-treated control animals. In contrast, no significant difference in mean survival was observed between excipient and rHTNF treated animals bearing MCA-38, -101, or -102. Histologically, the necrotic response of immunogenic MCA-106 and non-immunogenic MCA-102 tumors to systemically administered rHTNF was very similar. These two tumors differed morphologically, however, by the greater degree of chronic inflammation that was present at the periphery of the MCA-106 tumor in comparison with the MCA-102. By 72 hr after rHTNF administration, the sites of regressed MCA-106 tumors were replaced by a heterogeneous population of inflammatory cells and tumor cell \"ghosts\".(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of mouse spleen cells with periodate at the optimal mitogenic concentration (1 mM) induces the activation of suppressor cells of the in vitro antibody response and leads to the formation of aldehydes on the carbohydrate termini of the surface sialoglycoconjugates. These aldehyde moieties are found on the C8 (N-AN 8) and the C7 (N-AN 7) derivatives of sialic acid. Immediate borohydride reduction prevents the activation of the suppressor cells. Data from this work show that borohydride reduction must be performed within the first 6 hr to prevent the generation of suppressor cells; 18 hr after the initial periodate oxidation, borohydride treatment did not reverse the in vitro suppressive activity of periodate-treated cells. The kinetics of the disappearance of aldehydes from the cell surface were studied by using [3H]borohydride labeling and chromatographic analysis of sialic acid derivatives. About 70 to 80% of the aldehyde moieties were found to be present 6 hr after periodate oxidation. After 18 hr, 50 to 70% of the aldehyde had disappeared from the lymphocyte membrane. Oxidized sialyl residues disappear completely after 60 hr of culture. This period corresponds to the de novo synthesis of sialic acid residues on the surface of periodate-activated cells. The two classes of oxidized sialyl-glycoconjugates were found to behave in different ways. In effect, our data showed that the aldehydes remaining at 18 hr are mainly located on the gangliosides, whereas the aldehyde moieties located on high m.w. glycoproteins disappear from the cell surface between 9 and 18 hr. This would suggest that the remaining aldehydes located on gangliosides are not directly involved in the expression of suppressive activity.\r"

As assessed by indirect immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometric analysis, B54.2 antibody bound to serosal mast cells (S-MC), bone marrow culture-derived mast cells (BM-MC), fetal liver culture-derived mast cells (FTL-MC), and Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed FTL-MC (ABFTL-MC). However, the intensity of cell surface fluorescence exhibited by ABFTL-MC was approximately eightfold less per cell compared with nontransformed, culture-derived mast cells. Immunoprecipitation of B54.2 antibody-binding molecules from each population of mast cells labeled intrinsically with [35S]methionine and analysis by SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the B54.2 epitope was expressed in each case on two noncovalently associated proteins of 110,000 Mr and approximately 130,000 Mr, but that the percentage of radiolabel in the latter species was approximately threefold less in ABFTL-MC than in BM-MC. As assessed by pulse-chase analysis with [35S]methionine, the 110,000 Mr protein was a precursor of the 130,000 Mr molecule (\"B54.2 antigen\") synthesized by BM-MC. Labeling of BM-MC with [35S]methionine in the presence of tunicamycin followed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE of B54.2 antibody-binding material revealed a single species of 93,000 Mr, indicating that the native molecules contained N-linked carbohydrate. Endoglycosidase H treatment of the glycoproteins precipitated by B54.2 antibody from BM-MC reduced the Mr of the 110,000-Mr molecule to 93,000 Mr without an appreciable change in the 130,000-Mr species. These data indicate that the 110,000-Mr precursor form is a \"high mannose\" type glycoprotein and the 130,000-Mr membrane surface B54.2 antigen is a \"complex\" type glycoprotein, and that the epitope recognized by the B54.2 antibody on the surface of the mouse mast cell populations is located on the 93,000-Mr peptide core.\r"

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from patients with herpes zoster during the acute (less than 7 days after disease onset) and convalescent (more than 10 days after disease onset) phases of illness and from healthy seropositive donors. The PBMC were analyzed for: lymphoproliferative responses to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antigens, Leu-3 (helper/inducer):Leu-2 (cytotoxic/suppressor) ratios, and percentages of suppressor cells as defined by coexpression of the Leu-2 and OKM1 antigens. Significantly depressed proliferative responses of VZV antigens and Leu-3:Leu-2 ratios, and increased percentages of Leu-2+ OKM1+ suppressor cells were observed in PBMC of acute phase herpes zoster patients as compared with the PBMC of convalescent patients or healthy donors. These differences were also observed in individual patients sequentially studied during both phases of disease. Cryopreserved acute phase PBMC suppressed the proliferative response of autologous convalescent phase PBMC to VZV antigens, but not to herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigens. The acute phase PBMC suppressor cell was radiation sensitive and was identified as a Leu-2+ cell by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Thus, depression of cell-mediated immunity during the acute phase of herpes zoster was associated with a relative increase of lymphocytes expressing a suppressor cell phenotype and the activation of a radiosensitive Leu-2+ suppressor cell with some degree of antigen specificity.\r"

Experimental results demonstrated that the rapid rejection response and antigen-inducible changes in net intestinal ion transport acquired through active immunization were transferable with serum containing a high titer of anti-trichinella homocytotropic antibody, as measured by the PCA test. Neither response was expressed in nonimmune hosts nor in recipients of serum in which the PCA-detectable antibody was reduced by heat treatment. Net ion transport by jejunal epithelium of both actively and passively immunized rats was measured in Ussing chambers by using the electrical correlate, short circuit current (Isc). Involvement of chloride secretion in antigen-induced alterations in Isc was deduced from the use of chemical agents that effectively and specifically blocked the antigen-induced Cl- secretory response. The results implicate anaphylaxis in both rapid worm rejection and altered epithelial ion transport.\r"

The IgA antibody response to type 1 pili was as a mean 5.0-fold higher in milk than in bile. In contrast IgA antibody activity to 06 LPS was as a mean 6.3-fold higher in bile than in milk. The IgA antibodies to ferritin were randomly distributed between milk and bile. The IgG and IgM antibody activity to all three antigens studied were higher in the milk than in the bile. The secretory antibody response could be transferred from immunized rats to unimmunized rats with mesenteric lymph node cells (MLN) taken from donor rats 4 days after immunization in the Peyer's patches. IgA antibodies to pili and ferritin appeared solely in the milk of the recipients, whereas IgA antibodies to the 06 LPS only appeared in the bile. The ratios serum:milk and serum:bile for the IgG and IgM antibodies indicated an antigen-specific direction of homing with local production of these two isotypes primarily in the mammary gland. Antibody-forming cells of the IgA class could not be detected in the MLN on the day the cells were transferred. It is concluded that the difference seen in antibody distribution between milk and bile is not due to dissemination of antigen, but instead a result of different homing or expansion at the mucosal-glandular site dependent on the antigen specificity of the migrating cells.\r"

Biochemical studies on the transferred radioactivity showed that intact antibodies accumulated in the fetus for up to 3 days after antibody injection. During the same period, antibodies were eliminated from the maternal system. The transfer and accumulation of anti-MHC antibodies were independent of the MHC haplotype of the fetus. The pathway of antibody transfer and the localization of transmitted antibodies in the fetus were studied by autoradiographic analysis of the entire fetoplacental unit 24 hr after the injection of anti-paternal MHC antibodies. Our results indicate that antibodies are transferred by way of the placenta and yolk sac, and reach the fetus predominantly via the circulation. Within the embryo proper, the highest levels of antibody were found in the order of blood greater than thymus greater than fetal liver. Most other fetal organs, with the exception of brain and cartilage, showed antibody accumulation, but to a lesser extent. This pattern of antibody distribution over different tissues was similar for allogeneic and syngeneic fetuses. These findings demonstrate that various fetal tissues, including developing lymphoid cells can be directly exposed to the maternally transmitted anti-MHC antibodies, with possible functional consequences on the development of the fetal immune system.\r"

This inflammatory disease was distinct in several aspects from experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) induced by the retinal S-antigen (S-Ag). The current study examined the adoptive transfer of IRBP-induced EAU. We established that lymphocytes from IRBP immunized donor rats were capable of transferring EAU after in vitro stimulation with either IRBP (lymph node or spleen cells) or concanavalin A (spleen cells only). Recipients of these cells developed uveoretinitis and pinealitis identical to the actively induced disease. As compared with the S-Ag system, recipients of IRBP sensitized cells developed disease earlier, and smaller numbers of cells were needed to transfer EAU. Development of inflammation was directly related to a cellular response to the specific retinal antigen used for sensitization. Moreover, the unique nature of ocular inflammation was reestablished in the IRBP system: high proportions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes were found in the inflamed tissue of certain recipients despite a lack of a humoral response to the specific antigen. In contrast to the eye, only mononuclear leukocytes comprised the inflammation in the pineal gland.\r"

  ".W": "In some susceptible mouse strains, intracerebral (IC) inoculation of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) results in a persistent infection leading to chronic demyelinating disease. Previous genetic analyses between susceptible SJL/J and resistant C57BL/6 mice indicated a role for multiple unlinked genes in the development of clinical and histopathological disease, including a major influence of the D region of the H-2 complex. In this study, genetic analysis of a different strain combination (susceptible SJL/J and resistant BALB/c) also demonstrates the involvement of multiple genes, but the H-2 genotype (H-2s and H-2d, respectively) does not appear to contribute significantly to susceptibility differences. In both segregation studies and recombinant-inbred (R-I) analysis, clinical and histopathological disease occurs in both H-2s homozygotes and H-2d homozygotes (as well as H-2s/H-2d heterozygotes), with the actual frequency related to the proportion of non-H-2 genome from the susceptible strain. There appear to be at least two non-H-2 genes involved in differential susceptibility of SJL/J and BALB/c to TMEV-induced disease. Analysis of R-I strains generated from BALB/c and SJL/J progenitors indicates linkage of at least one of these non-H-2 genes to those encoding the constant portion of the beta-chain of the T cell receptor on chromosome 6. Many genes may actually be involved, but each strain comparison defines a different subset of these loci--only those at which the two strains in question carry \"functionally\" different alleles. Thus, different strain comparisons may accent the roles of different genes in resistance to the same infectious organism or disease process. In addition to the genes identified thus far, there may be yet other genes contributing to development of TMEV-induced disease, but their recognition may require analysis of still other strain combinations.\r"

We investigated the idiotypes of 10 monoclonal anti-MAG by using rabbit polyclonal antisera. Three groups of anti-idiotypic antisera could be distinguished. Four sera reacted only with the immunizing protein. Two sera reacted with a single other anti-MAG IgM in addition to the immunizing one. Immunoenzymatic studies showed that these two couples of anti-MAG IgM reacted identically with 100% cross-inhibition, indicating that the whole set of idiotypes identified by the rabbit antiserum was present on both IgM antibodies. The four other anti-idiotypic sera reacted with the homologous IgM, as well as with most of the other anti-MAG IgM. In contrast to the previous antisera the binding of these four sera to the homologous IgM could not be inhibited by other cross-reacting anti-MAG IgM. However, when a heterologous IgM was used for coating, these antisera with one exception showed complete cross-inhibition. The absence of inhibition by purified MAG of the patient of the anti-idiotypic antisera sera suggests that these antibodies are most likely to be directed against framework determinants rather than against combining site epitopes.\r"

Checkerboard analysis performed by seeding different concentrations of TNF above and below the filter revealed that maximal induction of migration required a positive concentration gradient between the lower and upper compartments and that TNF elicited an actual chemotactic response in phagocytes. An anti-TNF rabbit antiserum and anti-TNF mouse monoclonal antibody abolished the chemotactic activity of TNF. Recombinant lymphotoxin was also chemotactic for phagocytes, and its activity was blocked by an anti-lymphotoxin antiserum. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and blood large granular lymphocytes did not respond chemotactically to TNF under conditions in which appropriate reference chemoattractants were active. The chemotactic activity of TNF may serve to recruit phagocytic cells from the blood compartment to amplify resistance against noxious agents.\r"

Highly purified LIF (0.5 to 2 U/ml) induced a significant dose-dependent potentiation of neutrophil ADCC by up to 54.9% (p less than 0.001). Higher concentrations of LIF inhibited cytotoxicity. The degree of cytotoxicity was found to correlate (r = 0.99) with the increased secretion of superoxide after neutrophil-target cell interaction. Anaerobic conditions inhibited cytotoxicity mediated by both control and LIF-treated neutrophils. The latter observation lends support to the concept that enhanced ADCC was mediated through increased superoxide production and not through the induction of a separate pathway. Increased superoxide production may have resulted from an upregulation of the transduction mechanism leading to neutrophil stimulation through the Fc receptor. In addition, we demonstrated an increased capacity of the neutrophil to adhere to its target (average 3.3:1 effector:target ratio in untreated cells to 4.8:1 after treatment with LIF), and this may also have been responsible for the increase in the respiratory burst and subsequent enhanced ADCC. These observations provide potential support for an in vivo role for LIF in tumor immunity.\r"

DNA binding is much more frequent in the IgG than in the IgM myeloma proteins (p less than 0.001), and is also associated with cationic antibody charge. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis reveals markedly increased charge heterogeneity of both heavy and light chains of the monoclonal IgG as compared with the monoclonal IgM proteins. We postulate that the increased charge heterogeneity of the IgG-associated 3I-reactive kappa-light chains may reflect somatic mutation, and that DNA specificity within the 3I idiotype system arises by somatic mutation of germ-line genes found in normal individuals. DNA binding may be associated with those mutations that give rise to a cationic immunoglobulin charge.\r"

They are expressed on most melanomas, astrocytomas, and neuroblastomas and have been shown to function as effective targets for monoclonal antibodies. In previous studies, we have immunized melanoma patients and mice with a series of melanoma cell vaccines containing these antigens, but have observed only occasional antibody responses. We report here the results of experiments in which an irradiated whole cell vaccine shown previously to be optimal was compared with a series of vaccines containing purified GM2. Mice were pretreated with low dose cyclophosphamide (Cy), or not, and were immunized twice with syngeneic melanoma cells (JB-RH) known to contain 60 micrograms of GM2 or with vaccines containing 50 micrograms of purified GM2. Serum was obtained at regular intervals and was tested by immune adherence, complement dependent cytotoxicity, and protein A assays on the JB-RH cell line. The whole cell vaccine, GM2 alone, GM2 incorporated into complete Freund's adjuvant, and GM2 attached to E. coli were all minimally immunogenic. GM2 attached to Salmonella minnesota or BCG, and GM2 attached to certain liposome preparations containing monophosphoryl lipid A, were found to be moderately immunogenic. GM2 attached to the R595 mutant of Salmonella minnesota was found to be significantly more immunogenic. Pretreatment with Cy significantly increased the immunogenicity of this vaccine. The specificities of selected sera were tested in inhibition assays and were limited to GM2. Antibodies produced after immunization were generally exclusively IgM and mediated potent complement-dependent cytotoxicity on JB-RH cells. These results identify R595 as the most effective adjuvant tested for augmenting the immunogenicity of GM2 and show that with regard to antibody production, purified tumor antigen presented optimally can be more immunogenic than optimally presented whole tumor cells containing the same amount of antigen.\r"

The ability of nucleated cells to eliminate complement complexes is related to physiochemical properties of the complex, such as channel diameter, which in turn affect Ca2+ fluxes that stimulate metabolic processes involved in the elimination process. Paradoxically, these same channel properties that stimulate the defense response may also be responsible for the lethal effects of complement. To further study the role of channel size on cytolysis of nucleated cells by C5b-9, we examined the lytic efficiency of larger C5b-9 channels containing several C9 molecules in comparison with smaller C5b-9 channels containing fewer C9. We have obtained data to indicate that although the larger channels were more cytolytically potent, the channel size had little influence on the rate of cell death. In contrast, the rate of lysis of erythrocytes was substantially slower when smaller C5b-9 channels were present. In evaluating the effect of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]o, on nucleated cell lysis in the presence of a lytic number of C5b-9 complexes, it was observed that when the [Ca2+]o was increased the rate of cell death also increased. These findings suggest that lysis of nucleated cells by C5b-9, unlike erythrocytes, may not be entirely due to colloid osmotic deregulation.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of maleyl-BSA on specific protein expression in murine peritoneal macrophages by radiolabeling treated macrophages with [35S]methionine followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Such treatment induces the expression of a set of at least seven proteins (38, 42, 57, 65, 75, 80, and 85 kD). A similar set of proteins is also induced by treatment of macrophages with the algal polysaccharide fucoidan. The proteins resemble those induced in response to treatment of this same cell population with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as judged by co-migration in both one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Two proteins induced by either LPS or maleyl-BSA (e.g., p57 and p85) show similar primary structure, as assessed by partial proteolytic peptide mapping confirming their identity. The induction of these proteins by maleyl-BSA is a transient phenomenon, being expressed as early as 1 hr after treatment and declining after 8 hr even in the continuous presence of the stimulus. The dose of maleyl-BSA required to induce the response varies to some extent with the protein in question, but agrees with the Kd for ligand-receptor binding. Chloroquine, which blocks the degradation of ligand, does not inhibit the induction of early protein synthesis. Whereas the induction of these proteins is blocked by inhibition of RNA synthesis with actinomycin D, the reversible inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide during the induction phase does not prevent their expression. LPS, maleyl-BSA, and fucoidan previously have been shown to stimulate protease secretion and tumoricidal function in appropriately primed macrophages. The present findings now demonstrate that all three agents can also mediate the expression of early genes which may participate in the acquisition of functional competence.\r"

Depolarization of the mitochondria with metabolic inhibitors was not detected by bis-oxonol, suggesting that only potential changes across the plasma membrane were being measured. The resting membrane potential of RBL cells was largely generated by the equilibrium distribution of K+ and not through electrogenic activity of the sodium pump. Depolarization was maintained as long as IgE receptors remained aggregated. We believe that at physiologic calcium concentrations a large portion of the measured potential change may be due to calcium influx across the plasma membrane. Prevention of calcium influx by lanthanum, disruption of aggregated receptors, or prior depolarization in a high K+ saline solution completely inhibited the antigen-induced depolarization. The time course of the antigen-stimulated increase in bis-oxonol fluorescence was similar, but not identical, to the antigen-stimulated rise in cytoplasmic free ionized calcium measured with fura-2. Antigen-stimulated depolarization was inhibited by removing both calcium and sodium and could be restored by the addition of either ion. Reduction of total cellular adenosine triphosphate inhibited depolarization in response to antigen stimulation.\r"

Several cell lines with different metastatic propensities have been established in culture from a single surgical specimen of a human renal cell carcinoma following different selection procedures in nude mice. The cell lines exhibited significant differences in in vitro susceptibilities to cytotoxic effects of TNF. Kinetic analysis of the interaction of TNF with susceptible renal carcinoma cells demonstrated that a short 30 min interaction of TNF with the cells is sufficient to produce significant lysis 72 hr later. One cycle of exposure of sensitive cells to h-r-TNF did not produce cells resistant to it, nor did the degree of sensitivity to h-r-TNF vary after one passage of the cells in nude mice. Tumor cell resistance to the effects of TNF did develop spontaneously after prolonged cultivation in culture. We conclude that tumor cells derived from a single human renal cell carcinoma exhibit a heterogeneous response to the cytotoxic effects of h-r-TNF.\r"

  ".W": "The lytic activity of natural cytotoxic (NC) cells has several characteristics which clearly distinguish it from other cell-mediated lytic activities and from most soluble cytolytic factors. An exception is the lytic activity mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF). In this paper, we report a detailed comparison of NC and TNF lysis of target cells which are used as prototype NC targets or TNF targets, and show that the two cytolytic activities have very similar, if not identical, lytic mechanisms. We present data showing that target cells which are NC-sensitive are also TNF-sensitive and that target cells which are NC-resistant are also TNF-resistant. Moreover, cells selected either in vivo or in vitro for NC resistance are selected for TNF resistance, and cells selected for TNF resistance are selected for NC resistance. The analysis of the kinetics of 51Cr release mediated by NC cells or by TNF show that both activities affect similar kinetics, in that there is no cell lysis for several hours after targets and effectors first interact. However, NC and TNF lytic activities can be distinguished. By using the cell lines 10ME or B/C-N as targets, it can be shown that whereas NC-mediated lysis is dependent on protein synthesis, TNF-mediated lysis is not. We also show that targets which are resistant to NC-mediated lysis because they express a protein synthesis-dependent resistance mechanism also require protein synthesis to resist TNF-mediated lysis, suggesting that the same resistance mechanism protects cells against both NC cells and TNF. Together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that NC cells and TNF activate the same lytic mechanism within target cells and that TNF may mediate the lytic activity of NC effector cells.\r"

  ".U": "87110800\r", 
  ".W": "Leukotriene D4 (LTD4) increased the blood flow rate in human skin, equipotent to histamine in the dose range of 3.1-200 pmol. The vasodilatation lasted for up to 60 min, and no late reactions occurred. Indomethacin did not affect the LTD4-induced blood flow rate. H1 and H2 antagonists reduced the increase in blood flow rate, but did not abolish the response to LTD4. Local nerve block inhibited the axon reflex-mediated flare component of the LTD4-induced blood flow rate, leaving a local red reaction. This local red reaction was not affected by H1 and H2 antagonists. These results indicate histamine as a mediator of the axon reflex, and show that LTD4 causes a direct vasodilatory effect that is not mediated via histamine or cyclooxygenase products. The laser-Doppler flowmeter was applied for dynamic studies of the vasopressor response in the skin during a Valsalva maneuver, and the relative changes in blood flow were confirmed by control estimates of the blood flow rate by a 133xenon washout method. The pressor response to a Valsalva maneuver was reversed by local nerve block, but not affected by LTD4. Therefore LTD4 did not interfere with the sympathetic activity on the cutaneous vessels. Leukotriene D4 caused a dose-dependent wheal reaction, equipotent to histamine in the dose range of 0.2-200 pmol. Only minor whealing occurred when the vasculature to the test arm was occluded before injection of LTD4 and the circulation restored 30 min later. Most of the LTD4 was apparently metabolized within this period. Subsequent injections of LTD4 into the same sites demonstrated the development of tachyphylaxis with respect to whealing. This evidence suggests that LTD4 cannot mediate sustained inflammation. The injections of LTD4 caused neither pain nor itching. In conclusion, the elucidated properties point to LTD4 as a possible mediator of microvascular changes during acute inflammation.\r"

Two distinct HPVs were detected in the DNA extracted from these lesions, and their genomes were molecularly cloned and characterized. One of these HPVs, detected in 4 patients, was found to be identical with HPV13, whose association with FEH was already known. The other one, detected in 6 patients, was only weakly related to HPV13 and to the other HPVs associated with lesions of the mucous membranes, and constituted a new HPV type, tentatively named HPV32. Lesions from other types of oral papillomas, obtained from 14 additional patients, were also analyzed. Human papillomavirus DNA sequences were detected in the DNA preparations extracted from 5 specimens: HPV6 DNA in a condyloma and in a papilloma, 2 as yet uncharacterized HPV DNAs in 2 papillomas, and HPV32 DNA in a papilloma which showed histologic similarities to FEH. Thus, it seems likely that FEH of the oral mucosa is a disease associated with 2 specific HPVs--HPV13 and HPV32.\r"

In this study the effect of standardized freeze times on melanocytes in guinea pig skin (tricolored) is described at the anatomic level and at the light and electron microscopic level. Melanocytes are quantified in epidermal sheets following dopa staining at 1-, 2-, and 3-month intervals after freezing. All the lesions were initially hypopigmented with a peripheral rim of hyperpigmentation. This was a transient phenomenon associated with an absence of melanocytes. Pigment migrated into the lesions so that after 3 months all the lesions on black skin were diffusely hyperpigmented. Pigment was slower to return to the red skin. Hair follicles were destroyed in the center of the lesion. The epidermal sheets demonstrated that the hyperpigmentation was an epidermal phenomenon and was associated with increased numbers of melanocytes (p less than 0.001). These melanocytes were distributed evenly throughout the lesion in contrast to the irregular distribution in normal skin.\r"

Additional groups were irradiated for similar periods and kept for a further 6-24 weeks without irradiation. Skin samples were taken from dorsal and ventral (nonirradiated) surfaces and types I and III collagen were quantified densitometrically after cyanogen bromide digestion and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Type III collagen was expressed as a percentage of the total types I and III collagen and the ratio of dorsal/ventral type III (D/V III) was determined for each mouse. The ratio increased significantly in irradiated animals whereas it decreased in the corresponding period in control animals. In irradiated mice withdrawn from UV exposure the ratio D/V III tended to revert to control levels. These data are in agreement with those of our previous human studies, which showed an increase in type III collagen in sun-exposed skin when compared with covered sites.\r"

  ".W": "IgG-anti-keratin intermediate filament autoantibodies occur in low titers in all normal human sera. These same antibodies are present in high titers in the sera of patients who have diseases in which cells containing keratin intermediate filaments (KIF) have been damaged, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, graft-versus-host disease, and cutaneous tumors. Since some human autoantibodies are thought to function in part as opsonins promoting the removal of insoluble cellular proteins after tissue injury, we investigated the influence of IgG-anti-KIF autoantibodies on the phagocytosis of insoluble KIF aggregates by human monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). Keratin intermediate filaments assembled in vitro were reconstituted into dense spherical KIF aggregates 0.3-2.5 microns in diameter by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that, as expected, human IgG-anti-KIF autoantibodies bound to the KIF aggregates. Human monocytes or PMN were incubated either with nonopsonized KIF aggregates or with KIF aggregates that had been reacted with IgG-anti-KIF autoantibodies. The uptake of KIF aggregates was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase staining, and immunoelectron microscopy. Monocytes rapidly and efficiently bound and phagocytosed KIF aggregates that had been coated with IgG-anti-KIF autoantibodies. Nonopsonized KIF aggregates, in contrast, were taken up much less efficiently. Differences were most marked at 4 degrees C for 60 min with phagocytosis of opsonized KIF aggregates by 23 +/- 8% of monocytes in contrast to phagocytosis by only 0.2 +/- 3% monocytes when nonopsonized KIF aggregates were used. Similar results occurred at 37 degrees C for 5 min with phagocytosis by 38 +/- 28% vs 1.8 +/- 0.4% of monocytes of opsonized and nonopsonized KIF aggregates, respectively. A high percentage of PMN also phagocytosed opsonized KIF aggregates, whereas nonopsonized KIF aggregates were ingested less avidly. These data indicate that the opsonization of extracellular KIF aggregates by IgG-anti-KIF autoantibodies plays an important role in promoting the phagocytosis of KIF aggregates. The subsequent phagocytosis represents a rapid and very effective mechanism for the removal of insoluble KIF following keratinocyte cell death.\r"

Although SIFM effectively inhibits the chemotaxis of fibroblasts to interstitial collagens, fibronectin, lymphocyte-derived chemotactic factor for fibroblasts, and serum-derived chemotactic factor, it does not alter the chemotactic migration of human peripheral blood neutrophils or monocytes, and does not act as a cytotoxin to human dermal fibroblasts. The SIFM appears to act through a cell-directed mechanism to alter the fibroblast's ability to migrate. Serum inhibitor of fibroblast migration may function in vivo to modulate fibroblast migration under physiologic and pathologic conditions.\r"

While the polypeptide patterns obtained for keratin-enriched cytoskeletal preparations could be considered typical of normal interfollicular epidermis, they also disclosed variations, among the individuals, concerning some of the constituent protein subunits. Three sets of interindividually varying keratins could be distinguished owing to their distinct, though small, differences in electrophoretic mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and their similar or identical charge characteristics upon nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis: the basic keratins 1a and 1b as well as 5a and 5b and the acidic keratins 10a and 10b. Of each set either a doublet, showing a marked 1:1 ratio of polypeptides, or the one or the other variant protein was detected together with keratin 14, which did not display any variation in a series of 148 individual tissue samples tested. Thus, the keratin composition of human epidermis could be summarized in the formula: (1a v 1b) + (5a v 5b) + (10a v 10b) + 14. The systematic appearance of the variants suggested that each protein within a set is the product of an independent allele. In support of this hypothesis we have found that the same variant is expressed in other epithelia of a given individual. Moreover, the frequency of any of the keratins in our sampling concurred with the frequency predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg relation for the distribution of alleles in a population, as did the frequency distribution of particular keratin patterns.\r"

Such lipid mixtures have been shown to form lipid bilayers in the form of small, unilamellar liposomes when sonicated at 80 degrees C in water containing Tris buffer and 100 mM NaCl. In the present study it is shown that such liposomes are slowly transformed into large unilamellar liposomes and then into broad lamellar sheets after the addition of stoichiometric amounts of calcium chloride. The presence of free fatty acids was a necessary condition for this calcium-induced fusion. These observations may provide a useful analogy for the transformation of flattened liposomes into broad lamellar sheets that occurs during transition of epidermal granular cells into corneocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Elemental distribution in psoriatic skin varies with the functional state of the keratinocytes, e.g., electrolytes influence cell metabolism and cell proliferation, and trace elements play a crucial role in a great number of enzymes. Elemental distribution in pinpoint lesions, old plaques, and uninvolved skin of 5 psoriatic patients and 4 healthy controls was studied by means of PIXE (proton-induced x-ray emission) analysis. This technique allows the simultaneous detection of elements with an atomic number greater than or equal to 14 along the epidermis and dermis in freeze-dried skin biopsies. Trace elements such as Fe, Cu, and Zn were determined down to a level of 1 ppm. In comparison with uninvolved skin, concentrations of P and K were elevated in psoriatic epidermis. In addition, increased levels of K were correlated with the stage of the psoriatic lesion. Zinc concentrations were significantly elevated in pinpoint lesions. The Zn concentration profiles within the epidermis and upper dermis showed high correlation to the P concentration profiles. Iron levels were decreased in old psoriatic plaques, whereas Cu concentrations varied considerably. In comparison to the controls, Cl concentrations were markedly decreased in the dermis of involved and uninvolved psoriatic skin, whereas epidermal Cl levels were unaffected. As high K levels prevent the Ca-induced differentiation of keratinocytes, high K levels may be the cause of the high cell differentiation in psoriatic skin. Elevated DNA- and RNA-polymerases might be the cause of elevated Zn levels in pinpoint lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Ten patients with necrobiosis lipoidica lesions were studied. Five patients had diabetes mellitus. The age of the patients varied from 15 to 73 years and the duration of the skin lesions was from 2 to 20 years. Histologically, the lesions were characterized by degeneration of collagen and elastin. In some lesions elastin fibers could be seen in areas devoid of normal-looking collagen. Electron microscopy revealed loss of cross-striation of collagen fibrils and a marked variation in the diameter of individual collagen fibrils. The concentration of collagen, measured by assay of hydroxy-proline, a collagen-specific amino acid, was markedly decreased in the lesional skin, but the ratio of type I/III collagen was unchanged in the affected skin. Fibroblasts established from affected skin synthesized less collagen than cells derived from healthy-looking skin. The decreased collagen synthesis was due to a decreased amount of messenger RNA for type I procollagen, measured by hybridization with a specific human cDNA clone. The production of collagenase by these fibroblasts was not increased. Our results thus indicate that in necrobiosis lipoidica lesions, collagen fibrils are defective and the amount of collagen is reduced, probably due to decreased synthesis of collagen by affected fibroblasts.\r"

MCMV genomic material was present in femoral marrow cells on days 3, 5, 7, and 14, and detection of MCMV genomes correlated strongly with recovery of infectious virus. Peak infection occurred on day 5, when 0.003%-0.185% of the marrow cells contained MCMV genomic material. At peak infection, MCMV genomic material was observed predominantly in marrow mononuclear cells. Coincident with marrow infection, mice experienced significant leukopenia, whereas cessation of MCMV replication in marrow cells was associated with leukocytosis and restoration of normal peripheral blood leukocyte counts.\r"

  ".W": "Gas gangrene caused by Clostridium perfringens is associated with significant mortality and morbidity in spite of penicillin treatment. Although prompt surgical debridement has been established as the primary therapeutic objective, additional studies are needed for determination of the optimal antimicrobial therapy. In a mouse model of gas gangrene caused by Clostridium perfringens, clindamycin, metronidazole, rifampin, and tetracycline were all more efficacious than penicillin (P less than .05). Survival of penicillin-treated mice was not significantly better than that of untreated controls in spite of serum levels that ranged up to 77-1,800 micrograms/ml. Responses to metronidazole were highly dose dependent. For example, 60% of mice survived after 75 mg of metronidazole/kg, but only 10% survived after 19 mg/kg. In contrast, clindamycin was highly effective over a broad dosing range (8.6-86 mg/kg). The efficacy of all antibiotics was reduced if treatment was delayed or larger inocula of bacteria were used.\r"

Depending upon monkey species, from eight to 20 implants could be established in each animal. Animals were given estrogen before percutaneous inoculation of the autografts with Chlamydia. Acute inflammatory changes were found in homografts examined in the first week after infection, with chronic inflammatory changes noted thereafter. Chlamydial inclusions were detected within fimbrial epithelial cells up to seven days postinoculation by fluorescent-antibody staining and immunoperoxidase staining with C. trachomatis-specific monoclonal antibody. Organisms were recovered from autografts up to five days after infection. Analysis of serum antibody by microimmunofluorescence revealed that serotype E-specific antibody of both IgM and IgG classes was produced after infection. We conclude that subcutaneously implanted fallopian tube autografts may provide a useful primate model for kinetic studies of chlamydial infection and immunity.\r"

The epidermis was intact; however, the infection and toxin produced acute cellulitis characterized by extensive extracellular edema; disorganization of collagen bundles; large accumulations of cell debris and plasma proteins; damaged or necrotic fat cells, capillary endothelial cells, and muscle cells; and mild inflammatory cell infiltration. The virulent strain of V. vulnificus produced a capsule and was resistant to phagocytosis in vivo, whereas a weakly virulent strain of the bacterium did not produce a capsule and was readily phagocytized and digested. Factors that may be important in the pathogenesis of V. vulnificus wound infections include a capsule that inhibits phagocytosis and an extracellular cytolytic toxin that is responsible, at least in part, for the severe tissue damage characteristic of such wound infections.\r"

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibodies to type 8 CP was sensitive to 0.16 ng/ml in serum. All (23 of 23) animals infected with the prototype type 8 strain Becker had CP detected in one or more serum samples. Peak CP levels ranged from 0.16 to 240 ng/ml (median, 25 ng/ml). Among the 14 rats alive on day 2, antigenemia and bacteremia were significantly correlated (r = .71, P less than .005). CP was also present in serum of rats infected with three additional type 8 bacteremic isolates. All serum samples from animals infected with the type 5 prototype strain were negative in the type 8 ELISA. These studies document that the type 8 CP of S. aureus, previously identified only in vitro, is produced and released during in vivo infection and can be detected in serum of infected animals.\r"

The peripheral blood of most (71%) of the 42 individuals with RHD contained cells reacting with monoclonal antibody 83S19.23 or 256S.10, whereas these cells were present in only 17% of the 41 control subjects (P less than .02). However, none of 21 individuals with RHD had such cells in their tonsils, although they were present in the tonsils of 50% of the 40 control subjects (P less than .03). These results may reflect a failure in RHD or organ-specific homing of cells with the epitopes recognized by the antibodies. The presence of these cells in tonsils may be important in the immune response to streptococcal pharyngeal infection, and their absence in RHD may be involved in the unusual immune responses characteristic of this disease.\r"
