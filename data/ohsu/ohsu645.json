  ".W": "We measured the flow-resistance of five commercially available 10 cm H2O expiratory positive-pressure (EPP) valves (n = five per valve type) at bias flows of between 0 and 2,000 ml/s. We found that individual valves of each type and manufacturer functioned similarly. Different valve types, however, functioned differently: with one type, system pressure was higher than rated (p less than 0.05), and with another type, system pressure was significantly flow-dependent (p less than 0.01). The remaining types of valves had no flow-resistive properties and maintained a system pressure of 10 cmH2O. We conclude that system pressure is not similar in all continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) systems using bias flow and EPP valves. The work of breathing imposed by CPAP circuits will be increased in systems whose EPP valves have flow-dependent properties.\r"

Lymphocytes were measured with a calibrated microscope and termed \"activated\" if greater than 10 mu in diameter. If a patient demonstrated greater than 30 activated lymphocytes/cu mm, the same lymphocytes were stained with monoclonal antibodies directed to T-cell subsets and B cells. These findings were retrospectively correlated with endomyocardial biopsy results. Absolute numbers of T-cell subsets and B cells were analyzed via Student's t test to identify significant differences during acute cardiac rejection. Of 347 biopsy specimens, 47 demonstrated histologic features of acute cardiac rejection. Simultaneous immune activation of lymphocytes occurred with 33 of 47 samples, while another 51 episodes of lymphocyte activation were detected without acute rejection. No statistically significant differences in absolute numbers of T-lymphocyte subsets were noted at the time of acute rejection.\r"

Recent developments have elevated it to a central role in tuberculosis chemotherapy as the essential addition to isoniazid and rifampin which makes it possible to successfully complete treatment in six months. This is accomplished with no increase in hepatotoxicity. The only substantial side effect of this drug given at the dosage and for the duration used in these six-month regimens is a polyarthralgia which is only bothersome and not sufficient to warrant interruption of therapy. More rarely, acute gout is produced. The early history and pharmacology of this now first line antituberculosis drug are reviewed herein.\r"

Both regimens were initiated immediately before surgery. Forty-five patients were withdrawn from the study after randomization. Three hundred fifty two patients (175 receiving ampicillin and metronidazole and 177 receiving cefoxitin) completed the study and were followed for one month postoperatively. The frequency of septic and nonseptic complications was not statistically significant different between the two regimens. About one third of all septic complications appeared more than two weeks after surgery. It is concluded that short-term treatment with cefoxitin is at least as efficient as a three-day treatment with ampicillin and metronidazole.\r"

Recurrent bleeding from mucosal vascular lesions can be controlled with laser therapy. Methods for treating anorectal disorders also are evolving. The continuing development of new endoscopic systems for increasing ease of access to the gastrointestinal tract all point to ever-increasing applications for laser therapy in colonic and rectal surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is equated with chronic bronchitis and emphysema as one disease entity. In COPD airflow limitation is relatively persistent--unlike asthma. Tests for \"small-airways disease\" form no part of routine practice, for their accuracy in detecting pathological change is debatable. The proteolytic theory of the pathogenesis of emphysema highlights the role of neutrophil elastase, antielastases, oxidants, antioxidants, and thus of potential new treatments. Clinical features of COPD include breathlessness, cough, and sputum, with airflow obstruction and lung hyperinflation. The differential diagnosis includes bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension, but pulmonary fibrosis, etc., is distinguished by radiological infiltrates. Plain chest radiography cannot reliably diagnose emphysema in life, but a new method measuring lung density from the computed tomographic (CT) scan allows location, quantitation, and diagnosis of emphysema (defined by enlargement of distal air spaces) in humans in life. \"Pink puffers\" with breathlessness, hyperinflation, mild hypoxemia, and a low PCO2 are contrasted with \"blue bloaters\" with hypoxemia, secondary polycythemia, CO2 retention, and pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. Antismoking measures are a major aim in management. A bronchodilator regimen combining a slow-release oral theophylline with an inhaled beta 2-agonist, ipratropium, and high-dose inhaled steroids is proposed because even modest improvement in obstruction can help these patients. In acute exacerbations with purulent sputum, antimicrobials against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae are used with controlled oxygen therapy aiming to keep the arterial PO2 over 50 mm Hg without the pH falling below 7.25. Influenza prophylaxis is recommended, but pneumococcal vaccination remains debatable. Chronic under-nutrition in \"emphysema\" implies controlled trials of feeding regimens--but these remain to be assessed. Long-term oxygen therapy is the only treatment known to prolong life in blue bloaters, and oxygen concentrators and transtracheal oxygen delivery are discussed. Pulmonary vasodilators (e.g., beta 2-agonists, hydralazine, nifedipine, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, etc.) have not yet been proved to provide long-term reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure. Blue bloaters have severe nocturnal hypoxemia in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep that is corrected by oxygen or the investigational drug almitrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the first group blood glucagon rose to above 200 ng/liter for 5 h every day; in the second group it constantly stayed above 600 ng/liter. After both 2 (n = 5) and 14 (n = 5) days treatment the control total blood alpha-amino-nitrogen (AAN) concentration was 4.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter, and the urea nitrogen synthesis rate was 4.9 +/- 0.4 mumol/(min.100 g BW) (mean +/- SEM) in controls. In recurrent hyperglucagonemic rats, treated for both 2 (n = 5) and 14 (n = 5) days, total AAN was 3.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter (P less than 0.05 vs. control) and urea nitrogen synthesis rate 4.5 +/- 0.8 mumol/(min.100 g BW). In chronic hyperglucagonemic, treated for both 2 (n = 5) and 14 (n = 5) days, total AAN was 2.2 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter (P less than 0.05 vs. control) and UNSR 7.9 +/- 0.8 mumol/(min.100g BW) (P less than 0.05 vs. control). The urea excretion was identical in controls and during recurrent hyperglucagonemia, but it was increased by 50% during chronic hyperglucagonemia. Food intake was the same in all groups. N Balances decreased from 10 mmol/24 h to 5 mmol/24 h (P less than 0.05) by chronic hyperglucagonemia. The total organ N content did not change by recurrent hyperglucagonemia, but in chronic hyperglucagonemia it decreased to 65-85% (P less than 0.01) in carcass, intestines, liver, and kidneys. In conclusion chronic but not recurrent hyperglucagonemia increases the rate of urea synthesis and decreases the blood amino acid concentration. This is suggested to be a reason for the loss of N from organs by chronic hyperglucagonemia.\r"

  ".U": "89004888\r", 
  ".W": "The hydrophilic GH-binding protein of serum is a derivative of the GH receptor. Little is known how this GH binding protein is released from the receptor which is firmly anchored in the plasma membrane. The IM-9 lymphocytes provide a useful laboratory model for studying this process because they are richly endowed with GH receptors and, under special conditions, are able to shed these receptors during incubation. Incubation of IM-9 cells for 90 min at 30 C did not result in the appearance of significant [125I]hGH binding in conditioned medium as determined with an ultrogel AcA 44 minicolumn. When iodoacetamide, 20 mM, or N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mM, was added during incubation, the conditioned medium bound 20-35% of [125I]human(h)GH. p-Chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid was less effective in promoting shedding of GH-binding protein. In contrast, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), bacitracin, leupeptin, pepstatin, phosphoramidon, or chloroquine did not promote release of GH binding protein and did not affect iodoacetamide-induced release. Release was not inhibited by the addition of serum lacking GH binding protein. GH binding protein release was markedly temperature sensitive and practically ceased at 4 C. GH binding protein incubated with [125I] hGH was cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate. After sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dithiothreitol the complex migrated with an estimated molecular weight of 100,000 whereas [125I]hGH cross-linked to the membrane-bound GH receptor of the IM-9 cells migrated with an estimated molecular weight of 135,000. The smaller size of the binding protein is consistent with its derivation from the extracellular domain of the GH receptor. Because the release of this GH binding is greatly augmented by iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide, two known sulfhydryl reactive reagents, we suggest that a free sulfhydryl group, either on the GH receptor or on a neighboring protein normally maintains the integrity of the receptor. The loss of this sulfhydryl group destabilizes the receptor and permits a membrane endopeptidase to release the GH binding protein. Cleavage is not dependent on lysosomal action and is not inhibited by protease inhibitors.\r"

Hepatocytes were freshly isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats treated with dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) for 4 days and from untreated littermates. Dexamethasone had no effect on insulin receptor number, while EGF receptor binding was slightly increased (21.3% vs. 17.2% binding/10(6) cells) after dexamethasone treatment. In hepatocytes from both control and dexamethasone-treated animals labeled with 32P, insulin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor as well as of a 175K protein believed to be its endogenous substrate. The degree of phosphorylation of the insulin receptor was decreased 34% by dexamethasone treatment compared to the control value when studied in fasted animals. In contrast, phosphorylation was increased to a similar extent by dexamethasone treatment in fed animals. In addition, the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor extracted from dexamethasone-treated animals migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a slightly increased mobility compared to normal (89 +/- 1.2K vs. 92.5 +/- 0.4K). EGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of its own receptor and of a 120K protein in intact hepatocytes. Their degree of phosphorylation was decreased by 30% as a result of dexamethasone treatment in the fasted animal and was unchanged in the fed animals. Our data indicate that glucocorticoids modulate insulin and EGF receptor kinase activity, but the nature of their effect depends on other factors, including the dietary state of the animal. These studies also suggest that postreceptor changes account for a major component of glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance.\r"

  ".U": "89004894\r", 
  ".W": "Mouse mammary tissue, when cultured in the presence of insulin, corticoids, PRL, and physiological levels of T3, shows increased synthesis and secretion of alpha-lactalbumin. Tissue cultured in the presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, PRL, and T3 synthesizes two distinct forms of alpha-lactalbumin, but secretes only one form. Tissue cultured in the absence of T3 synthesizes and secretes only one form. To address the question of whether these two electrophoretically distinct forms arose by differential glycosylation of the same polypeptide or by synthesis of two different polypeptide precursor chains, mammary tissue was cultured in the presence of insulin, corticoids, and PRL with or without T3, and the mRNA and alpha-lactalbumins were isolated. Northern blot analyses indicated that mammary gland tissue cultured in the presence of T3 contained 2.46 times more alpha-lactalbumin mRNA than tissue cultured only in the presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, and PRL. This enhanced mRNA level was confirmed by in vitro translation experiments where tissue cultured in the presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, PRL, and T3 produced mRNA that resulted in 2.1 times as much radiolabeled alpha-lactalbumin as tissue cultured in the absence of T3. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis of the in vitro translation products revealed only one band, suggesting the presence of only one message. Endoglycosidase digestion of the two forms of alpha-lactalbumin produced in the presence of T3 resolved them into a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Thus, the electrophoretic differences between the two forms synthesized in the presence of T3 appear to be due to differential N-linked glycosylation of the same polypeptide chain and not to synthesis of two different polypeptide precursor chains.\r"

Increasing concentrations of glutamate stimulated somatostatin release in a dose-dependent manner. Since this effect was decreased by Mg2+, all experiments were performed in Mg2+-free media. We found that excitatory amino acid agonists evoked somatostatin release in the following order of potency: quisqualate greater than glutamate = N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) greater than kainate, as calculated from the dose-response curves. The increase in somatostatin release elicited by glutamate or NMDA was selectively antagonized by DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid and by thyenyl-phencyclidine, two specific antagonists of NMDA receptors. The NMDA effect was strongly inhibited: in a competitive manner by APV and in a noncompetitive manner by TCP with IC50 of 90 microM and 0.2 microM, respectively. Glutamate-induced somatostatin release was not blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 microM) suggesting that tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium-dependent action potentials are not involved in this effect. Our data suggest the presence of functionally active excitatory amino acid receptors in somatostatinergic neurons. Glutamate seems to exert its stimulatory action on somatostatin release essentially through NMDA type receptor sites.\r"

  ".W": "Fatty acid metabolism in adipocytes is known to be regulated by the intracellular transducer cAMP. This study was undertaken to determine the temporal and hormonal regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase during the differentiation of preadipocyte mesenchymal cells to adipocytes. For this we have used a stable cell line (TA1) in which the undifferentiated preadipocyte acquires adipocyte functions and morphology after growth to confluence. We observed that synthesis of type I and II cAMP-dependent protein kinases was induced during the adipogenic conversion of growth-arrested TA1 cells. In preconfluent cells, neither mRNAs encoding regulatory subunits (RI, RII beta) and catalytic subunit (C alpha) nor the peptides themselves were detectable. Within several days of growth arrest at high cell density, mRNAs for RI, RII beta, and C alpha were detectable in total RNA extracted from cell populations. The subunits themselves were detectable in some, but not all, of the cells by indirect immunofluorescence. Immunoblotting of cytosolic extracts indicated that RI and the beta-isoform of RII (mol wt = 52,000) were expressed in these cells. Analysis of subunit presence or absence in single cells by immunofluorescence also indicated that kinase subunit expression preceded the accumulation of lipid droplets within the cells. Further, the subunits were predominantly associated with a reticular cytoplasmic structure (Golgi apparatus?) abutting the nucleus. Conversion of TA1 cells to adipocytes can be accelerated by indomethacin (125 microM) or dexamethasone (1 microM) treatment, compounds that also enhanced the accumulation of RII beta and C alpha mRNAs. Within 2-3 days of addition of indomethacin to confluent cultures, RII beta message content is increased about 20-fold, and protein content is increased about 5-fold relative to those in untreated cultures. C alpha mRNA content is increased about 5-fold relative to that in untreated cells. The response to dexamethasone requires 6-7 days, and changes in RII beta message levels were the most pronounced. We also observed the induction of mRNAs for the functionally relevant mRNA lipoprotein lipase in indomethacin-treated cells. In addition to this apparent transcriptional regulation of kinase subunit expression, we provide evidence for regulation at the posttranscriptional level. Within a differentiated culture, there exist stem cells that can be selected, will repopulate the dish, and will again differentiate into adipocytes upon growth arrest at high cell density. In preconfluent populations of these stems cells, unlike the preconfluent TA1 cells originally plated, both RII beta and C alpha messages were present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Radiolabeled insulin or IGF-I were incubated with cell membranes from rapidly proliferating (subconfluent) or nonproliferating (confluent) MC in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled heterologous and homologous ligands (0-10(-6) M). Insulin binding to MC was specific and saturable, with Scatchard analysis of binding data showing the characteristic curvilinear plot. The predicted insulin binding maximum of 4.2 X 10(-12) M/100 micrograms protein for a theoretical high affinity site was consistent with a relatively low density of receptors, which were the same in proliferating and nonproliferating cell preparations. Specific binding of IGF-I to MC was also demonstrated. Binding data for membranes from proliferating cultures generated a linear Scatchard plot, which predicted a binding maximum of 3.5-9.7 X 10(-11) M/100 micrograms protein and a Kd of 2.0-3.2 X 10(-9) M. In contrast, membranes from nonproliferating cultures had no demonstrable specific binding of IGF-I. Covalent cross-linking of radiolabeled IGF-I to membranes from subconfluent cells demonstrated specific binding to a 145K membrane protein. A 95K membrane protein from a partially purified receptor preparation demonstrated autophosphorylation when incubated with 5 X 10(-9) M IGF-I. Incubation of MC with 10(-9) M IGF-I doubled cellular growth rates, an effect that could be duplicated only with high concentrations (10(-6) M) of insulin. These observations indicate that MC express predominantly receptors for IGF-I, and that growth stimulatory effects of physiological concentrations of IGF-I and pharmacological concentrations of insulin are probably mediated through the IGF-I receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been produced which recognize specific epitopes on bovine renal mitochondrial vitamin D3 1 alpha- and 24-hydroxylases. Renal mitochondria cytochrome P-450s were partially purified to 0.5-2 nmol/mg by Emulgen 911 and cholate solubilization, followed by chromatography on a 2-(4,6-dichloro-O-biphenyloxy)ethylamine HBR affinity column. Reduced carbon monoxide difference spectra determined that this preparation contained 0.5-2 nmol P-450/mg protein. This preparation contained both 1 alpha- and 24-hydroxylase activities, and Eadie-Hofstee plots of product formation as a function of substrate concentrations have maximum velocities of 1.4 and 4 pmol product/30 min.mg protein and Km values of 690 and 1300 nM, respectively. Bovine renal hydroxylases were isolated by immunoprecipitation from this partially purified P-450 preparation with a polyclonal antibody specific for rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 RLM5. This polyclonal antibody immunoprecipitated both 1 alpha- and 24-hydroxylase activities as well as renal mitochondrial cytochrome P-450, as determined by reduced CO spectra. Bovine renal mitochondrial components were immunoisolated and used to immunize BALB/c mouse spleen cells in vitro. MAbs then produced were screened for 1) immunoisolation of renal mitochondrial hydroxylase activity from a partially purified preparation, 2) immunohistochemical detection of antigen in renal proximal tubule cells, and 3) immunoquantitation of renal hydroxylases in a solid phase sandwich (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and by 4) Western blot analysis. MAbs were isolated with specifically immunoprecipitated 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity, 24-hydroxylase activity, or both. In 10 micron sections of bovine kidney, antibodies detected antigen only in proximal tubule cells on the basal surface, which is rich in mitochondria. No antigen was detected in sections of pancreas or liver. In the solid phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, MAbs detected 1 alpha and 24-hydroxylases only in renal mitochondria and not in liver microsomes or adrenal gland mitochondria. In a Western blot, MAbs specific for epitopes expressed on both hydroxylases detected a single band(s) at 52,000-53,000 daltons. Apparently it is not possible to discriminate between hydroxylases by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Western blots. By these criteria, MAbs have been generated which are specific to epitopes expressed on bovine renal mitochondrial 1 alpha- and 24-hydroxylases.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative cytochemical techniques have been employed in a study of some of the acute effects of low doses (0.01----1 mU/liter) of TSH on the metabolism of guinea pig thyroid segments maintained in nonproliferative organ culture. The enzymes involved in the synthesis of NADP+ (NAD+ kinase), its reduction by the pentose-shunt (glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase), and its reoxidation both by the microsomal electron chain (diaphorase activity) and by participation in other cellular processes, have been examined. The effect of TSH on peroxidase activity has also been studied. After 10 min stimulation with TSH (1 mU/liter) there was a 60% increase in NAD+ kinase activity which preceded changes in the microsomal reoxidation of NADPH (up 33% by 30 min). There were no changes in the activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. There was a sustained rise in peroxidase activity which reached 129% over control after 30 min. This is the first in vitro demonstration of an acute stimulation of peroxidase and kinase activities by physiological concentrations of TSH. NADPH reoxidation after stimulation with TSH was such that the ratio of NADPH reoxidized via the microsomal respiratory pathway (diaphorase, hydrogen pathway 1) relative to that available for cytosolic utilization (hydrogen pathway 2) increased compared to the unstimulated controls. We suggest that increased NADP+ production (via NAD+ kinase activity) and the preferential shuttling of the NADPH for reoxidation via the microsomal respiratory pathway, coupled with greatly stimulated peroxidase activity, may be important regulators of the control of thyroglobulin iodination and hence thyroid hormone production.\r"

  ".U": "89004931\r", 
  ".W": "Increased proteolytic degradation of the estrogen receptor (ER) was detected in uterine cytosol of estradiol-treated ovariectomized mice compared to saline controls. Estradiol had no direct effect on the proteinase activity or susceptibility of the ER to the enzyme. The proteolytic activity gradually increased after a single injection of estradiol with early increases at 2 and 8 h followed by a progressive increase which reached a maximum at 36 h. The proteinase(s) activity resulted in cleavage of the native ER form of 65,000 (65 K ER) to a product of limited proteolysis having an apparent molecular weight of 54,000 (54 K ER). The pH optimum for this proteinase activity was 6.0. The proteinase was inhibited by 2.5 mM p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and 2.5 mM p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate and partially inhibited by 2.5 mM iodoacetamide but not by 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml antipain, 0.1 mg/ml chymostatin, 0.1 mg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mg/ml E-64, 2.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 2.5 mM diisopropylfluorophosphate, and 10 mM EGTA. The results suggested that the proteinase(s) had a thiol group essential for its activity. Estrogen receptor in the mouse uterine cytosol fraction appears to be degraded sequentially in two steps in which 65 K ER is cleaved to a 54 K ER which upon longer incubation is further degraded to a 37 K form. The second step was inhibited by leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, E-64, and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid. A possible function of the 54 K ER under physiological conditions is discussed since the 54 K ER was also found in nuclear samples. This form of the ER still retains the ability to bind estradiol and DNA.\r"

  ".U": "89004938\r", 
  ".W": "To evaluate the functional relationship between the liver calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor and guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, we investigated the effects of nucleotides not only on adenylate cyclase activation by CGRP, but also on 125I-[Tyr0]rat CGRP binding to rat liver plasma membranes. In the presence of GTP, rat CGRP stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in a dose-dependent manner in rat liver plasma membranes, and this effect was reduced in the absence of GTP. Salmon calcitonin also enhanced adenylate cyclase activation in the presence of GTP, but only in higher concentrations. On the other hand, guanine nucleotides not only decreased 125I-[Tyr0]rat CGRP binding to rat liver plasma membranes, but also accelerated the dissociation of label binding, and the removal of Mg2+ from incubation medium attenuated this inhibitory action of GTP on 125I-[Tyr0]rat CGRP binding to membranes. Scatchard analysis of the data revealed that the reduction of 125I-[Tyr0]rat CGRP binding by GTP was due to the decrease in binding affinity without a significant change in binding capacity. These findings lead us to conclude that binding of CGRP to its receptors activates adenylate cyclase in rat liver plasma membranes via a guanine nucleotide-dependent process, suggesting the involvement of guanine nucleotide-binding stimulatory protein in the action of CGRP.\r"

The substantia nigra (SN) and the area tempestas (AT) have been identified as two exemplary substrates for the control of experimental seizures. In animal models, GABAergic transmission has been shown to protect against seizures of different origins and methods of induction. Neuroactive peptides and excitatory amino acids may work with GABA in the SN to control the propagation of a wide variety of seizure types. In contrast, inhibition of AT pons selectively protects against seizures associated with limbic circuits. The AT is also a site from which bilaterally synchronous convulsions can be triggered in response to manipulations of cholinergic, GABAergic, and excitatory amino acid receptors. Definition of other pathways of seizure development and the effects of pharmacologic treatments on discrete brain regions await further research efforts.\r"

A leader in the use of electroencephalography in epilepsy, he described the first nearly pathognomonic EEG pattern and demonstrated specific features for each of the three most common types of seizure. His pioneering investigations into the biochemical basis of epilepsy helped to identify pathological mechanisms in epileptic attacks. Lennox stood alone in his belief, now generally accepted, that the genetics of epilepsy could be understood only through a multifactorial mode of inheritance. The author presents an affectionate portrait of the physician, the teacher and the man, the founder of the Seizure Unit and the unifying force in the study of epilepsy by both professionals and lay persons.\r"

Six of 114 (5.3%) cases treated conservatively had persistent trophoblastic activity. The decline in serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and progesterone (P) at 3 and 6 days postoperatively was similar in the \"persistent ectopic\" and the \"resolved ectopic\" groups. However, beyond day 6 both beta-hCG percentage of baseline and P level were significantly higher in the \"persistent ectopic\" (greater than 22.6 +/- 6.6%, greater than 3.4 +/- 0.7 ng/ml, respectively) than the \"resolved ectopic\" group (less than 2.7 +/- 0.8%, less than 0.2 +/- 0.05 ng/ml, respectively). Four patients underwent a second operation, whereas two were managed expectantly. These data suggest that the diagnosis of persistent ectopic gestation is best made by an initial measurement of serum beta-hCG or P at 6 days postoperatively, and at 3 day intervals thereafter. The choice of management may be determined by various factors including serum beta-hCG and patient's symptoms.\r"

Two different responses to diabetes emerged from the present study. The first response, which involves noradrenaline and vasoactive intestinal peptide, was characterized by a sign of degeneration, where there was an initial increase in tissue level and immunoreactivity of the transmitters followed by a decrease in tissue level and density of nerve fibers at 16 and 25 wk after induction of diabetes. The second response, which involves 5-hydroxytryptamine, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide, was characterized by changes in tissue level and immunoreactivity of the transmitters with no evidence of degeneration. The third feature was one of resistance to change due to diabetes, which was demonstrated by neuropeptide Y-containing nerves, where there was neither a change in tissue level of neuropeptide Y nor a change in immunoreactivity. It seems likely that the overall changes described will have profound implications in the function of the gut in the streptozotocin-diabetic rat model that may have some parallels in diabetic humans.\r"

  ".W": "Duplex ultrasound was used to evaluate the effects of 350-cal, 300-ml protein, fat, carbohydrate, and mixed (Ensure-Plus) liquid meals on celiac, superior mesenteric, and femoral artery blood flow in 7 healthy volunteers. Ingestion of separate water and mannitol solutions served as controls for volume and osmolarity. Duplex parameters of peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, mean velocity, and volume flow were determined before, and serially for 90 min after, ingestion of each test meal. Maximal changes were compared with baseline values. There were no significant changes in any of the blood flow parameters derived from the celiac or femoral arteries after any test meal ingested. In contrast, maximal changes in all superior mesenteric artery parameters were increased significantly over baseline (p less than 0.05) after each of the test meals except water, with end-diastolic velocity showing proportionally the greatest increase. The study demonstrates that duplex ultrasound can provide a noninvasive means of studying the reactivity of the splanchnic arterial circulation to different stimuli and documents differing blood flow responses to variation of nutrients.\r"

A panel of four murine monoclonal antibodies that recognize tumor-associated antigens was used to test purified colonic mucins for epitope expression by radioimmunoassay and to test formalin-fixed, deparaffinized sections of colon by the immunoperoxidase technique. The panel included monoclonal antibodies 19-9, B72.3, DU-PAN-2, and CSLEX1. Colonic mucins were purified from uninvolved surgical specimens by gel filtration with Sepharose 4B and cesium chloride-guanidine hydrochloride density gradient ultracentrifugation. Purified mucins from uninvolved colonic mucosal specimens from 4 of 7 patients with ulcerative colitis expressed one or more of these epitopes by radioimmunoassay, whereas mucins from 6 disease controls did not. Reactivity patterns were heterogeneous. Immunoperoxidase testing demonstrated staining with two or more antibodies in 14 of 18 involved inflammatory bowel disease segments, whereas control sections rarely stained with these antibodies, with the exception of 19-9. Sections of uninvolved mucosa from 4 of 9 patients with ulcerative colitis stained with two or more antibodies. Staining patterns were heterogeneous. The results demonstrate that colonic expression of tumor-associated epitopes occurs frequently in involved segments from both patients with ulcerative colitis and with Crohn's disease, whereas only patients with ulcerative colitis frequently expressed these epitopes in uninvolved segments.\r"

During the 4-mo period of therapy, 10 of 31 (32%) treated patients and only 1 of 14 (7%) control patients became negative for serum hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase. All 10 patients who became negative for serum hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid subsequently had a marked improvement in serum aminotransferase activities and lost hepatitis B e antigen from serum, and 9 of them had improvement in liver histology. Comparison of responders to nonresponders indicated that female sex and a high initial level of serum aspartate aminotransferase correlated best with response to interferon therapy. These findings indicate that a 4-mo course of recombinant alpha-interferon can induce a remission in disease in approximately one-third of patients with chronic hepatitis B.\r"

Immunoblot analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate gel-resolved microsomal proteins from human and rat liver using anti-liver/kidney microsome1-positive sera revealed a single polypeptide of 48 kilodaltons (human microsomes) or 50 kilodaltons (rat microsomes). Levels of the 50-kilodalton rat microsomal polypeptide were suppressed in vivo by several drugs known to modulate expression of individual forms (enzymes) of hepatic cytochrome P-450, with the largest decrease effected by phenobarbital. Dot blot analysis using a panel of 10 electrophoretically homogeneous rat liver cytochrome P-450 forms under nondenaturing conditions established that the two methylcholanthrene-inducible forms, P-450 BNF-B and P-450 ISF-G (P-450 gene subfamily IA), are selectively recognized by the anti-liver/kidney microsome1 antibodies. These findings demonstrate that sera associated with autoimmune (anti-liver/kidney microsome1) chronic active hepatitis are specifically reactive with select rat hepatic P-450 forms and suggest that these autoantibodies may be principally directed against one or more constitutive forms of the corresponding human liver cytochromes.\r"

Baseline values for urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion, sodium excretion, and creatinine clearance, as well as serum aldosterone, plasma renin activity, and plasma free norepinephrine, were obtained preoperatively with patients on a sodium- and fluid-restricted diet. Diuretics were also withheld. Similar parameters were measured immediately postoperatively during four consecutive 2-h intervals, then again at 2 wk and 3 mo. In patients with refractory ascites, mean baseline urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion was significantly elevated (2.5 +/- 0.8 pmol/min), compared with that in both normal controls and cirrhotics without ascites (1.3 +/- 0.3 pmol/min). A significant natriuresis occurred immediately postoperatively and persisted at 2 wk and 3 mo. Concomitantly, the elevated levels of preoperative vasoconstrictor substances gradually normalized by 2 wk. Urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion, however, rose transiently in the immediate postoperative period and then fell gradually to within the normal range by 3 mo. Enhanced renal prostaglandin E2 synthesis, therefore, does not play a role in the sustained improvement in sodium homeostasis after peritoneovenous shunting in patients with refractory ascites.\r"

In patients with gallstones (a) cholesterol crystals better helped to identify cholesterol gallstones (sensitivity, 87%; specificity, 97%; positive predictive value, 97%) than did an abnormal cholesterol saturation index of bile (sensitivity, 93%; specificity, 48%; positive predictive value, 73%); (b) the presence of cholesterol crystals was significantly related to the cholesterol content of gallstones and the bile cholesterol saturation index; and (c) bilirubinate crystals, when present alone (without cholesterol crystals), were good predictors of pigment gallstones (sensitivity, 71%; specificity, 93%; positive predictive value, 88%). In the absence of stones, bilirubinate crystals were present in 9 of 28 patients without biliary stenosis (4 with alcoholic cirrhosis and 2 with alcoholic pancreatitis) and 8 of 11 patients with biliary stenosis. In the absence of stones, cholesterol crystals were present in 2 of 28 patients without biliary stenosis and in 4 of 11 patients with biliary stenosis, suggesting that bile stasis can induce cholesterol crystal formation.\r"

The conventional cultures grew bacteria in only 13 (43%) of 30 episodes of neutrocytic ascites, whereas the blood culture bottles grew bacteria in 28 (93%); this difference was significant (p less than 0.0001). The blood culture bottle method also resulted in more rapid detection of bacterial growth. The median concentration of bacteria in infected ascites was one organism per milliliter. Bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles with ascitic fluid is more sensitive than the conventional method in detecting bacterial peritonitis. The insensitivity of the conventional method is probably due to the low concentration of bacteria in infected ascites and the small volume of ascites cultured by this method.\r"

Recent studies suggest that noninvasive tests such as quantitative nuclear scintigraphy and fatty meal sonography may aid in diagnosing functional common bile duct obstruction. Continuous manometry of the biliary tree with microtransducer technologies may allow a greater understanding of the causes of pain in this group of patients. Only 1 case report of pharmacologic management for this disorder exists in the literature. Endoscopic sphincterotomy may be helpful in relieving the pain that occurs in this condition but is associated with increased risks. There is no consensus in the literature as to the best test that will predict response to sphincterotomy. Controlled trials of medical therapies are needed.\r"

An agent that is antihypertensive in one patient may increase blood pressure in another or have no effect in a third. We believe that this variety of individual response to drug treatment can provide a new framework for the study of hypertensive subjects. Different patterns of response elicited by sequential trials of individual drugs with different mechanisms of action (diuretics, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, and converting enzyme inhibitors) should provide another means to classify hypertensive patients into biologically relevant groups. The documentation and analysis of this therapeutic heterogeneity in relation to renin profiling and to other physiological and demographic parameters may add a new dimension to the investigation of the pathophysiology of hypertension; it may serve as a basis for more appropriate stratification of participants in clinical trials and may ultimately contribute to a more rational approach to patient management.\r"

The diuretic was titrated from 50 to 100 to 200 mg daily as needed until the diastolic BP fell below 90 mm Hg (goal BP) or side effects supervened. Of the 305 patients who completed the 10-week titration period, 65% attained goal BP. The effective dose of hydrochlorothiazide in 52% of these responders was 50 mg/day, and this was associated with weight loss averaging 1.58 kg. An additional 29% achieved goal BP with a similar degree of weight loss, but they required double the dose, or 100 mg/day. The remaining 19% of responders required significantly greater weight reductions averaging 3.14 kg to achieve goal BP, which necessitated hydrochlorothiazide, 200 mg/day. More blacks than whites attained goal BP despite similar degrees of weight loss in the two races. Plasma renin activity was initially higher in whites than in blacks and rose significantly more in blacks and whites requiring the greatest volume losses and the highest dose of hydrochlorothiazide to attain goal BP. Nonresponders had less weight loss than responders. Thus, diuretic dose requirements vary in different patients and are related either to different volume losses in response to a given dose or to different degrees of BP reduction in response to the same volume loss.\r"

Specific anti-rh-renin antiserum was used to identify the 125I-rh-renin. Plasma disappearance of the exogenously administered 125I-rh-renin in marmosets (n = 6) showed two exponential components, with a half-life of 12.1 +/- 1.9 minutes for the rapid component and 120.3 +/- 16.4 minutes for the slow component. The metabolic clearance rate was 1.17 +/- 0.26 ml/min/kg. Thirty minutes after the injection of 125I-rh-renin, 43.1 +/- 0.9 and 3.5 +/- 0.5% of the injected dose had distributed to the liver and the kidneys, respectively. With time, the accumulated 125I-rh-renin in the liver and kidneys decreased. The accumulation of 125I-rh-renin was less than 1% of the dose injected in other organs such as lungs, heart, spleen, adrenal glands, testes, and ovaries. Analysis of liver and kidney extracts by high performance liquid chromatography at 30 and 120 minutes indicated that immunoreactive 125I-rh-renin decreased with time and was accompanied by an increase in nonimmunoreactive degradation products of a low molecular weight. The incubation of 125I-rh-renin with monkey or human plasma at 37 degrees C did not degrade the labeled renin. Therefore, rh-renin was rapidly cleared from the circulation by the liver and the kidney.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is a labile humoral agent released by vascular endothelium that mediates the relaxation induced by some vasodilators, including acetylcholine and bradykinin. EDRF also inhibits platelet aggregation, induces disaggregation of aggregated platelets, and inhibits platelet adhesion to vascular endothelium. These actions of EDRF are mediated through stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase and the consequent elevation of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate. EDRF has been identified as nitric oxide (NO). The pharmacology of NO and EDRF is indistinguishable; furthermore, sufficient NO is released from endothelial cells to account for the biological activities of EDRF. Organic nitrates exert their vasodilator activity following conversion to NO in vascular smooth muscle cells. Thus, NO may be considered the endogenous nitrovasodilator. NO is synthesized by vascular endothelium from the terminal guanido nitrogen atom(s) of the amino acid L-arginine. This indicates the existence of an enzymic pathway in which L-arginine is the endogenous precursor for the synthesis of NO. The discovery of the release of NO by vascular endothelial cells, the biosynthetic pathway leading to its generation, and its interaction with other vasoactive substances opens up new avenues for research into the physiology and pathophysiology of the vessel wall.\r"

RNA blotting analysis detected renin mRNA in control kidney and brain. Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and high salt (1%) treatment of experimental animals resulted in a greater than 95% decrease in the content of renin mRNA in the kidney, as compared with values in control rats receiving 0.4% NaCl in their diet. In contrast, high salt (1%) treatment alone caused only a twofold decrease in kidney renin mRNA content, as compared with values in controls. DOCA and low salt (0.04%) or low salt (0.04%) treatment alone caused a 1.5-fold increase in the kidney renin mRNA content, as compared with values in control rats. These results indicate that DOCA and salt have a synergistic effect in depressing renin mRNA levels in kidney. Clipping of the left renal artery caused a threefold increase in the steady state level of renin mRNA in the ischemic kidney and a 0.5-fold decrease in the hypertrophied kidney. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that blood pressure and other stimuli regulate the expression of the renin gene in vivo.\r"

Acting in the periphery and at central sites of afferent integration within multiple compartments at multiple levels, they modify the secretion of other hormones yet are themselves secreted during stress to produce important biological effects. Usually quiescent, the opioid system becomes active during a host of stresses to optimize, integrate, and buffer bodily responses. During stress, endorphins act to limit sympathetically driven responses such as tachycardia and vasoconstriction; however, if given to resting subjects, opiates may evoke the very responses they inhibit during stress. As the roles of individual opioid peptides and opiate receptors are studied in increasing depth, an amazing degree of functional heterogeneity and detail has emerged. Such knowledge has barely begun to be exploited in creating the next generation of therapeutics.\r"

Some researchers selected experimental groups from a population different from that used for the control group. It is unclear from the animal studies using nonacupunctured controls whether the controls received physical contacts with the experimenters comparable to those experienced by the experimental animals. The choice of acupuncture points used may also contribute to the inconsistency between experiments, since according to traditional acupuncture theory, points are not equivalent in their mediation of systemic effects. Duration of the acupuncture treatment, frequency of sampling, and time from treatment to last sample were not standardized. There is little consistency between studies even after adjustment for sampling time. Most of the statistically significant changes have been seen with electroacupuncture, and they appear to occur soon after onset of treatment, then disappear within 30 minutes of needle removal. However, the subjective changes in pain threshold have lasted several hours following needle removal. As an analgesic technique or adjuvant, acupuncture has been used most successfully in dental procedures and relatively superficial operations such as thyroidectomy; however, it has also been employed in more complex operations. The blood pressure and heart rate stability that have been observed with acupuncture analgesia have not been sufficiently explained and warrant further investigation, as does the possibility that acupuncture may be helpful in shock states characterized by increased stress hormone concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Lactic acid accumulates in contracting muscle and blood beginning at approximately 50-70% of the maximal O2 uptake, well before the aerobic capacity is fully utilized. The classical explanation has been that part of the muscle is O2 deficient and therefore lactate production is increased to provide supplementary anaerobically derived energy. Currently, however, the predominant view is that lactate production during submaximal dynamic exercise is not O2 dependent. In the present review, data and arguments in support of and against the hypothesis of O2 dependency have been scrutinized. Data underlying the conclusion that lactate production during exercise is not O2 dependent were found to be 1) questionable, or 2) interpretable in an alternative manner. Experiments in human and animal muscles under various conditions demonstrated that the redox state of the muscle is reduced (i.e., NADH is increased) either before or in parallel with increases in muscle lactate. Based on experimental data and theoretical considerations, it is concluded that lactate production during submaximal exercise is O2 dependent. The amount of energy provided through the anaerobic processes during steady-state submaximal exercise is, however, low, and the role of lactate formation as an energy source is of minor importance. It is proposed that the achievement of increased aerobic energy formation under conditions of limiting O2 availability requires increases of ADP, Pi, and NADH and that the increases in ADP (and therefore AMP via the adenylate kinase equilibrium) and Pi will stimulate glycolysis, and the resulting increase in cytosolic NADH will shift the lactate dehydrogenase equilibrium toward increased lactate production.\r"

To gain insights into these relationships, we studied male Wistar rats (187-245 g) during sustained hyperglycemia by use of the glucose clamp technique. Four groups of sedentary fed rats (n = 8/group) either ran (Ex) at 24 m/min, 0% grade, or rested (R) for 40 min. Thirty minutes after Ex or R, arterial blood glucose was elevated to and maintained at 11 mM for 2 h by a variable glucose infusion. At the start of Ex or R rats had saline (Sal) or naloxone (Nal, an opioid antagonist) intravenous infusions for 160 min (40 min Ex + 30 min R + 90 min of a 120-min glucose clamp). Steady-state glucose infusion rates (SSGIR) were approximately 55 mg.kg-1.min-1 at the start of the clamp and declined significantly over the 2nd h to approximately 45 mg.kg-1.min-1. No significant differences existed in SSGIR between groups. R-Sal and Ex-Sal groups did not differ in their insulin response to hyperglycemia. In contrast, when all groups were compared at the end of the Nal or Sal infusion, Ex-Nal had the lowest insulin concentration (749 +/- 174 pmol/l), whereas the R-Nal group had the highest (1,581 +/- 216 pmol/l, P less than 0.05). These data suggest a stimulatory role for EOP on insulin secretion that is expressed after a prior stress (Ex). Thus one function of exercise-induced activation of EOP may be to regulate insulin secretion in the immediate postexercise period.\r"

Qtr normalized for carotid arterial pressure [Qtr(n)] was determined before and after the exposure of the tracheal mucosa to aerosolized phenylephrine (0.25-2.0 mg), isoproterenol (0.05-0.8 mg), and methacholine (2.5-20 mg). The same doses of methacholine were also administered during the intravenous infusion of vasopressin. The measurements were repeated after intravenous pretreatment with the respective antagonists phentolamine, propranolol, and atropine. Mean +/- SE base-line Qtr(n) was 1.2 +/- 0.1 ml.min-1.mmHg-1.10(2). The autonomic antagonists had no effect on mean Qtr(n). Phenylephrine produced a dose-dependent decrease in mean Qtr(n) (-70% at the highest dose), which was blunted by phentolamine, and isoproterenol produced a dose-dependent increase in mean Qtr(n) (40% at the highest dose), which was blocked by propranolol. Methacholine failed to alter mean Qtr(n) even when Qtr was first decreased by vasopressin. We conclude that in lightly anesthetized adult sheep 1) base-line Qtr(n) is not under adrenergic or cholinergic control, 2) a locally administered alpha-adrenergic agonist decreases and beta-adrenergic agonist increases Qtr(n) via specific receptor activation, and 3) a locally administered cholinergic muscarinic agonist has no effect on Qtr(n).\r"

Diabetic rats with initial plasma glucose concentrations of 200-450 mg/dl and control rats were divided into trained and sedentary subgroups. Training resulted in lower plasma free fatty acid concentrations and increased triceps muscle citrate synthase activity in both the control and diabetic rats; triglyceride concentrations were lowered by training only in the diabetic animals. Oral glucose tolerance and both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in hindquarter skeletal muscle were impaired in the diabetic rats, and plasma glucose concentrations (measured weekly) gradually increased during the experiment. Training did not improve the hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, or decreased skeletal muscle glucose uptake in the diabetic rats, nor did it alter these parameters in the normal control animals. In considering our results and those of previous studies in diabetic rats, we propose that exercise training may improve glucose homeostasis in animals with milder degrees of diabetes but fails to cause improvement in the more severely insulin-deficient, diabetic rat.\r"

The permeability of rat epitrochlearis muscle to 3-O-methylglucose (3-MG) was measured after exposure to a range of insulin concentrations 30, 60, and 180 min after a bout of exercise. Thirty and 60 min after exercise, the effects of exercise and insulin on 3-MG transport were additive over a wide range of insulin concentrations, with no increase in sensitivity or responsiveness to insulin. After 180 min, when approximately 66% of the exercise-induced increase in sugar transport had worn off, both the responsiveness and sensitivity of the glucose transport process to insulin were increased. These findings appear compatible with the hypothesis that the actions of exercise and insulin result in activation and/or translocation into the plasma membrane of two separate pools of glucose transporters in mammalian skeletal muscle.\r"

The mean baseline CBF from 42 studies of 274 measurements in 9 (5 male and 4 female) adult beagles was 6.6 +/- 1.1 Hz. The stimulating effects of a beta 2-adrenergic agonist, fenoterol, and a muscarinic cholinergic agonist, methacholine, on CBF were studied on four and eight beagles, respectively. The studies were randomized and blinded. Aerosolized 10(-5) M fenoterol stimulated the CBF from the base line of 6.8 +/- 2.5 to 32.0 +/- 17.9 Hz in four dogs. Aerosolized methacholine stimulated the CBF from the base line of 5.8 +/- 0.7 to 9.4 +/- 3.0 Hz for 10(-8) M, and to 12.6 +/- 3.1 Hz for 10(-6) M in eight dogs.

There is physiological and autoradiographic evidence for a vesicular pathway. The purpose of this study was to determine the localization of natural bile acids in the liver using antibodies against cholic acid conjugates and ursodeoxycholic acid. An indirect immunoperoxidase technique was used on rat liver sections fixed either with paraformaldehyde (PF) and saponin, a membrane-permeabilizing agent that allows penetration of antibodies into the cell, or with PF alone. Retention of taurocholate in the liver after tissue processing was 26 +/- SD 15% of the bile acid initially present. When sections fixed with PF and saponin were incubated with the antibody against cholic acid conjugates, a granular cytoplasmic staining was observed by light microscopy in all hepatocytes. By electron microscopy, strong electron-dense deposits were observed mostly on vesicles of the Golgi apparatus (GA) and, sometimes, in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). After taurocholate infusion, the intensity of the reaction increased. When the liver was fixed with PF alone, almost no reaction was visible on light microscopy, but on electron microscopy the label was localized on the hepatocyte plasma membrane, mainly on the bile canalicular domain and to a lesser extent on the sinusoidal domain. With the antibody against ursodeoxycholic acid, no staining was observed in three of four livers, and a slight staining was observed in one. However, after infusion of ursodeoxycholic acid, staining of GA and SER vesicles was observed when the liver was fixed with PF and saponin. With PF alone, the reaction was intense on the canalicular membrane. These results support the view that, within the limits of the method, vesicles from the GA and possibly vesicles of the SER are involved in the intracellular transport of bile acids before canalicular secretion.\r"

In neither cell type is this mechanism induced upon exposure to the opsonized target. PMN require an additional signal for stimulation of the respiratory burst; this is not true of monocytes. On the other hand, monocytes require an exogenous source of lactoferrin in order to activate this pathway for enhanced ingestion. The dependence of this pathway for both PMN and monocytes on superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and cell-bound lactoferrin is consistent with a role for locally generated reactive oxygen metabolites, possibly hydroxyl radicals, in phagocytosis amplification. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease, who are genetically deficient in the ability to activate the respiratory burst, are unable to amplify Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Thus, these patients may have a previously unrecognized defect in the recruitment of phagocytic function at inflammatory sites.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of cultured human endothelial cells (HEC) by inflammatory stimuli, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), increases their surface adhesiveness for blood leukocytes and related cell lines. We now report that activated HEC also generate a soluble leukocyte adhesion inhibitor (LAI), which accumulates in conditioned media from IL-1-, TNF-, or LPS-treated, but not sham-treated, HEC cultures. LAI significantly inhibits the adhesion of PMN and monocytes to activated, but not unactivated, HEC. In contrast, LAI has no effect on the adhesion of lymphocytes, the promyelocytic cell line HL-60 or the monocyte-like cell line U937 to HEC monolayers. LAI appears to act directly on the leukocyte, but does not inhibit either agonist-induced responses in PMN (membrane depolarization, changes in cytosolic calcium concentration, superoxide production) or PMN attachment to serum-coated plastic surfaces. Endothelial generation of LAI is blocked by actinomycin D but not by aspirin or indomethacin. Preliminary biochemical characterization indicates that LAI is a soluble, protein-containing molecule that is heat- and acid-stable. Fractionation by HPLC gel filtration yields a single peak of LAI activity (14,000 less than Mr greater than 24,000). Thus, in addition to proadhesive cell surface changes, the endothelium may also actively contribute to the regulation of endothelial-leukocyte interactions at sites of inflammation in vivo through the production of soluble adhesion inhibitors such as LAI.\r"

  ".W": "We characterized the elastase and antielastase activity of the alveolar fluid of seven patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and thirteen normal volunteers. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) concentrations were 60-fold higher in ARDS as compared to normal lavage fluid (2,140 +/- 498 nM; 36.1 +/- 4.2 nM, respectively). ARDS fluid antineutrophil elastase activity was also considerably higher than that of normals (979 +/- 204 nM; 31.3 +/- 2.9 nM, respectively). Despite the antineutrophil elastase excess, 5 of 7 ARDS lavage samples contained elastase activity (mean, 6.1 +/- 2.4 pM) as assayed using low-molecular-mass substrate, while only 1 of 13 normal subjects had detectable elastase activity (0.2 pM) (P less than 0.01, compared with ARDS). That this activity was due to alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2MG)-complexed neutrophil elastase was evidenced by (a) the Sephadex G-75 elution profile; (b) the inactivity against insoluble [3H]elastin; (c) the inhibitory profile with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, methoxy-succinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-valyl-chloromethylketone, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, and A1AT; and (d) the immobilization by A2MG antibody bound to polystyrene plates. Furthermore, in agreement with the predicted affinity of A1AT and A2MG for neutrophil elastase, the ratio of A2MG to A1AT in the fluid (0.57%) coincided with the ratio of the A2MG- to A1AT-complexed elastase (0.36%). These findings suggest that the net lung protease-antiprotease balance in ARDS is shifted largely in favor of the antiproteases (chiefly A1AT), and that the antiproteases, A1AT and A2MG, have similar affinities for neutrophil elastase in vivo.\r"

IL-3 directly stimulated the division and migration of primitive erythroid burst forming units, while GM-CSF merely sustained their net survival in culture without promoting division and expansion. IL-3 promoted the formation of larger numbers of multipotential granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte colony forming unit--derived colonies than did GM-CSF. These data indicate that human IL-3 and GM-CSF have overlapping but distinct hematopoietic activities, and suggest a potential role for the clinical application of combined IL-3/GM-CSF therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin receptor function was examined in cultured skin fibroblasts from three patients with leprechaunism (Ark-1, Minn-1, and Can-1), a rare syndrome of severe insulin resistance and neonatal growth retardation. All three patients cell lines demonstrated insulin binding less than 15% of control. This was primarily due to reduced affinity of the receptor in Can-1 and due to reduced number of receptors in the other two cell lines (Ark-1 and Minn-1). When expressed as a fraction of total insulin bound, the percentage of cell-associated insulin internalized and degraded did not differ between the patient cell lines and the controls. However, chloroquine, which inhibited degradation by 50% in the control cells, had no effect in the cells from the patients. When normalized to insulin binding, insulin receptor autophosphorylation was normal in cells from Can-1, but reduced in those of Ark-1 and Minn-1. In contrast, the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity toward exogenous substrates was decreased in all three patient cell lines. These results suggest that leprechaunism is a biochemically heterogenous disease associated with a variety of alterations in receptor function. Cells from Ark-1 and Minn-1 exhibit parallel alterations in receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity. Cells from Can-1 demonstrate normal receptor autophosphorylation but reduced kinase activity, thus displaying a unique form of a mutant insulin receptor. Despite reduced kinase activity, all three cell lines exhibit normal rates of insulin internalization, but decreased lysosomal-mediated degradation. Our data imply that receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity may be regulated separately and that kinase activity may be linked to insulin degradation, but not necessarily internalization.\r"

Treatment of human neutrophils with botulinum C2 toxin for 45 min increased FMLP-stimulated superoxide anion (O2-) production 1.5-5-fold, whereas only a minor fraction of the cellular actin pool (approximately 20%) was ADP-ribosylated. Effects of botulinum C2 toxin depended on toxin concentrations, presence of both components of the toxin, and incubation time. Cytochalasin B similarly enhanced O2- production. The effects of botulinum C2 toxin and cytochalasin B were additive at submaximally, but not maximally effective concentrations and incubation time of either toxin. Botulinum C2 toxin also enhanced stimulation of O2- production by Con A and platelet-activating factor, but not by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Botulinum C2 toxin increased FMLP-induced release of N-acetyl-glucosaminidase by 100-250%; release of vitamin B12-binding protein induced by FMLP and PMA was enhanced by approximately 150 and 50%, respectively. Botulinum C2 toxin blocked both random migration of neutrophils and migration induced by FMLP, complement C5a, leukotriene B4, and a novel monocyte-derived chemotactic agent. The data suggest that botulinum C2 toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of a minor actin pool has a pronounced effect on the activation of human neutrophils by various stimulants.\r"

In addition, this augmentation in the ANC was accompanied by an increase in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase, a marker of secondary granule formation. In six of eight patients analyzed, an increase in bone marrow myeloid to erythroid cell ratio was seen. Day 14 peripheral blood cell derived colony forming unit granulocyte macrophage were also increased by day 6 of rhG-CSF treatment. Circulating levels of eosinophils and basophils were unchanged; however, a 10-fold increase in monocytes was observed in patients treated at the highest doses. There was also a small increase in CD3+ lymphocytes that was not dose dependent. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count remained near baseline throughout the period of rhG-CSF administration. These findings demonstrate that rhG-CSF is a potent stimulus for normal neutrophil proliferation and maturation.\r"

  ".W": "A characteristic feature of airway smooth muscle is its relative sensitivity to relaxant effects of beta adrenergic agonists when contracted by inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, vs. resistance to these relaxant effects when contracted by muscarinic agonists. Because contractions presumably depend upon the hydrolysis of membrane phosphoinositides (PI) and the generation of inositol phosphates (IP), our goal was to test for the effects of forskolin, isoproterenol, and dibutyryl cAMP on histamine- vs. methacholine-induced IP accumulation in canine tracheal smooth muscle. Methacholine (10(-3) M) was a more effective stimulant of IP accumulation (9.6 +/- 2.1-fold increase) than equimolar histamine (3.6 +/- 0.5-fold increase) in this tissue. When responses to equieffective methacholine (4 x 10(-6) M) and histamine (10(-3) M) were compared, neither forskolin, isoproterenol, nor dibutyryl cAMP significantly decreased IP accumulation in response to methacholine. In contrast, each of these three agents significantly decreased responses to histamine (by 56 +/- 9, 52 +/- 2, and 61 +/- 2%, respectively). We concluded that, in canine tracheal smooth muscle, increased cAMP is associated with inhibition of PI hydrolysis in response to histamine but not methacholine. The findings suggest a novel mechanism for selective modulation by cAMP of receptor-mediated cellular activation.\r"

Marrow cores were fixed in cold Bouin's solution, rinsed in cold phosphate buffer, dehydrated in cold methanol, infiltrated and embedded in cold GMA, then polymerised at 4 degrees C. Sections were cut at 2 micron thickness with a Tungsten carbide knife in a Jung's high performance microtome (Autocut). Antigenecity was preserved when drying slides at room temperature but pronase digestion was necessary to re-expose the antigens in bone marrow biopsy sections embedded in GMA. Histostik, a new adhesive, was used to coat the glass slides to prevent section loss during enzyme digestion and immunostaining procedures. This method of adapting plastic embedding to undecalcified marrow cores preserves marrow architecture and cellular details and it can serve as a useful adjunct to analyse the bone marrow from patients with myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders. This technique may also be applicable in non-haematological malignant conditions which affect the marrow.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the systemic nature of many agents that provoke flushing reactions, the erythema is most prominent in the \"blush area.\" To elucidate the physiologic basis for such a limited distribution, two types of flushing challenges were studied in normal volunteers. Nicotinic acid provokes flushing through a direct action of vasodilator prostaglandins on vascular smooth muscle. The flushing reaction provoked by oral thermal challenge is mediated via neural mechanisms. Both agents led to increases in cutaneous blood flow at both malar and forearm sites. Both absolute and proportional increases were consistent with the view that the greater vascular capacitance in the visible, superficial cutaneous vasculature in the blush area accounts for the limited distribution of flushing in response to a systemic stimulus.\r"

Because there are no published studies in which women took acne medications throughout pregnancy, information about safety must be obtained indirectly from studies in which the agents were taken for another indication during some portion of pregnancy. Oral tetracycline is associated with maternal liver toxicity and deciduous tooth staining in the infant, and tetracycline occasionally has been associated with other congenital anomalies. Maternal isotretinoin ingestion is associated with major craniofacial and cardiac deformities, as well as other congenital anomalies. Erythromycin, however, appears to be safe. Topical acne medications never have been implicated as a cause of fetal deformities in human beings. Dermatologists should be aware of potential toxic and teratogenic effects of acne medicines before prescribing them to women of childbearing age. Prompt reporting of adverse effects is encouraged.\r"

  ".W": "Over the past two decades it has become clear that the ability of a host to generate antibodies against a wide variety of potential antigens is due to structural diversity in the antibody molecule within the variable region. This diversity results in sites within the molecule that are themselves immunogenic. These immunogenic sites are called idiotopes, and the collection of idiotopes on a single antibody molecule determines that antibody's idiotype. The idiotype of an antibody molecule is defined serologically by a second antibody termed an anti-idiotype. Anti-idiotypic antibodies can recognize antibody molecules bearing similar or identical structures within the variable regions, which are often on or near sites of antigen binding. Investigation into the nature of idiotype and anti-idiotype interactions has increased our knowledge of antibody structure, antigen-antibody interactions, the regulation of antibody production, and the nature of autoimmune disorders. This review will discuss the nature of idiotypes and anti-idiotypes and their potential role in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of autoimmune, infectious, and malignant diseases.\r"

The relative advantages and risks of the various forms of primary anesthesia and supplemental analgesia used for liposuction surgery in the office by dermatologic surgeons is described. Effective anesthetic techniques include infiltration of local anesthesia (LA) with or without intramuscular (IM), intravenous (IV), or nitrous oxide sedation, cryoanesthesia, and IV or inhalation general anesthesia (GA). Local anesthesia, using large volumes of dilute anesthetic solution containing lidocaine (0.05%), epinephrine (1:1,000,000), and sodium bicarbonate (12.5 meq/L), is a safe and effective modality for liposuction by dermatologists. In a study of 12 liposuction patients treated with this technique, the average lidocaine dose was 1181 mg (9.4 mg/kg/hr). The highest peak lidocaine blood level among all patients was 0.484 microgram/ml. Dermatologists should not assume the dual responsibility of surgeon and of monitoring patients given IV sedation. Any form of anesthesia has the potential for serious complications. The surgeon and office staff must be well trained and equipped to perform emergency resuscitation.\r"

  ".W": "During the past 10 years, more than 80 orally active vasodilator and inotropic agents have been tested in the clinical setting to evaluate their potential utility in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Although the initial reports of all of these drugs suggested that each represented a major therapeutic advance, only three agents--digoxin, captopril and enalapril--have produced consistent long-term hemodynamic and clinical benefits in these severely ill patients. Most of the other drugs that have been tested have not (to date) distinguished themselves from placebo therapy in large-scale, controlled trials, even though these agents produce hemodynamic effects that closely resemble those seen with digitalis and the converting-enzyme inhibitors. These observations suggest that the hemodynamic derangements that characteristically accompany the development of left ventricular dysfunction cannot be considered to be the most important pathophysiologic abnormality in chronic heart failure. Although cardiac contractility is usually depressed in this disease, positive inotropic agents do not consistently improve the clinical status of these patients. Similarly, although the systemic vessels are usually markedly constricted, drugs that ameliorate this vasoconstriction do not consistently relieve symptoms, enhance exercise capacity or prolong life. Hence, correction of the central hemodynamic abnormalities seen in heart failure may not necessarily provide a rational basis for drug development, and future advances in therapy are likely to evolve only by attempting to understand and modify the basic physiologic derangements in this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "To examine mast cell involvement in allergic rhinitis, levels of tryptase, a specific marker for mast cell activation, and histamine, a marker of mast cell and basophil activation, were measured in nasal-lavage fluid after nasal-allergen challenge. Twelve atopic subjects with allergic rhinitis and five nonatopic subjects were challenged with timothy grass or ragweed pollen at increasing doses of allergen. Tryptase and histamine levels were determined by an ELISA and radioenzyme assay, respectively; clinical responses were measured by assessment of sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and ocular tearing or itching. A positive clinical response was observed in seven of the atopic subjects and in none of the nonatopic subjects. Tryptase levels increased at least sevenfold higher than baseline levels in 100% of the atopic clinical responders and reached a maximum at the same dose of allergen where clinical symptoms were maximal. In contrast, histamine levels were only threefold or greater elevated in five of seven atopic clinical responders at this dose of allergen. (Histamine levels were lower in one subject and were only 50% higher in another subject than the corresponding baseline value.) Histamine levels and symptom scores were maximal at the same dose of allergen in only four of seven clinical responders. Overlap of peak mediator levels in subjects without a clinical response with those of the clinical responders occurred only in the case of histamine. Tryptase levels in nasal-lavage fluid appear promising as a useful indicator of allergic reactions and indicate that mast cell activation is the major factor in the immediate nasal-allergic response.\r"

Three subjects had worsening of the immediate response after IT. Among dog-sensitive subjects with asthma, three of five subjects with only an immediate response demonstrated an ablation of the immediate response, whereas the one subject who was the only subject with a dual response before IT lost the dual response after dog-extract IT (p value of 0.005 on one-tailed test). Immediate systemic side effects, including one episode of anaphylaxis, occurred on seven occasions of 326 injections with cat extract compared to only one episode of rhinitis of 289 injections with dog extract.\r"

Restricted antigenic cross-reactivity of Cynodon dactylon (Bermuda grass) pollen allowed development of a new method to identify antigens associated with grass-pollen grains. Pollen applied to the surface of an adhesive tape was blotted onto nitrocellulose, and the blots were identified by anti-Bermuda-grass antibodies, second antibody, and fluorescence microscopy. Of the 44 species of grass pollen studied for specificity of the method, the only species to demonstrate uniformly bright staining were Cynodon dactylon, Elymus triticoides, Elymus cinereus, and Koeleria cristata. Thirty-one species were negative, and nine other species demonstrated occasional brightly fluorescent spots, suggesting contamination. The immunoblotting method was used to study Tucson air collected continuously by a Burkard pollen and spore trap throughout April 1986. Each 2-hour transect of the adhesive tape from the trap was examined by immunoblotting and by normal light microscopy to compare antigen particle counts with grass-pollen counts. The mean antigen-particle concentration, 52.8/m3 of air, was higher than the mean grass-pollen concentration, 21.9/m3 of air, suggesting presence of amorphous Bermuda-grass antigens in air samples. Antigen-particle concentration, not grass-pollen concentration, correlated significantly with wind velocity, temperature, and time of day.\r"

  ".W": "This article provides an overview of five decades (1936 through 1987) of publications on individual dietary assessment methodology, such as dietary histories, estimated and weighed food records, food frequency questionnaires, and 24-hour recalls. Representative studies were selected to characterize data collection and analyses methods of each decade. During the 1930s and 1940s, dietary intake methodology was in its initial stages; popular methods were the dietary history technique and lengthy food records. The 1950s were characterized by extensive comparisons of methodologies, which now often included shorter-term food records and 24-hour recalls. The 1960s ushered in large scale epidemiological studies, the food frequency technique, and use of computer technology for computation; the 24-hour recall was still widely used in that decade and the next. Advances of the 1970s and 1980s include expansion of nutrient databases, sophisticated statistical techniques for analysis, and refinement of data collection methodologies for analysis, and refinement of data collection methodologies. The chronological approach used in this review not only highlights progress of each decade but also identifies the repetitive efforts of some studies. The need for creative approaches is emphasized as current research needs are identified.\r"

Recent research suggests that it may not. Second, can the new portable bar code scanner technology be used to study nonadherence? Other forms of monitoring are obtrusive or inaccurate. Finally, can inexpensive computer assisted instructions (CAI) be used to teach mnemonic techniques specifically designed to improve medication schedule recall? Current research on memory training teaches nonspecific mnemonics and uses the expensive classroom approach. Results of the present study suggest that physically active and cognitively alert elders do have significant nonadherence (control group = 32.0%) problems related to forgetting and that CAI courseware can significantly reduce (medication recall training group = 10.0%) this form of nonadherence. Portable bar code technology proved easy to use by elderly patients and provided detailed information about the type of forgetting underlying nonadherence. Most significant recall failure was in the complete forgetting to take medication rather than delays in medicating or overmedicating.\r"

  ".U": "89009408\r", 
  ".W": "In the three endocrine/neuroendocrine systems discussed, there are demonstrable declines in post-maturational responsiveness. Parathyroid hormone stimulation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production declines with age in the kidney as does calcium absorption in the intestine. Chronotropic and inotropic responsiveness to beta-adrenergic agonists decreases with age in the myocardium, and performance on passive avoidance tasks related to memory dysfunction declines with age in rodents. In each case there is a corresponding decrease in receptor activation with age. Parathyroid hormone receptors are less able to activate adenylate cyclase in older rat kidneys; beta-adrenergic receptors have reduced density in some tissues, demonstrate reduced agonist affinity (are uncoupled), and are less able to activate adenylate cyclase in most tissues with age; and muscarinic receptors demonstrate mixed agonist affinity (are uncoupled) with age in rat hippocampal cells. This reduction in receptor activation can be attributed to desensitization to increased agonist concentrations. Parathyroid hormone receptor activation is restored by parathyroidectomy, beta-adrenergic agonists no longer desensitize in older animals, and muscarinic receptors from senescent rats pharmacologically mimic desensitized receptors. However, desensitization of receptor activation cannot fully account for the reduced hormonal responsiveness in any of these systems. Parathyroidectomy does not restore 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production or intestinal calcium absorption. There are age-related post receptor deficits in beta-adrenergic pathway that are not mediated by changes in serum catecholamines. In conclusion, there are significant changes in receptor and post-receptor biochemistry with age. The overall decreases in hormonal responsiveness are not due to a single biochemical defect in the system and are probably multiple in nature.\r"

The authors attempted to define a subset of these adult patients who, based on clinical criteria, could reliably be excluded from cervical spine radiography, thus avoiding unnecessary radiation and saving considerable time and money in their evaluation. Patients fell into four groups: (1) patients who were awake, alert, and had no complaint of neck pain or tenderness on physical examination; (2) patients who were awake, alert, but had complaint of neck pain or tenderness on physical examination laterally over the trapezius muscle only; (3) patients who were awake, alert, but had complaint of central neck pain or tenderness on physical examination over the cervical spine or center of the neck; and (4) patients who were not fully awake or alert, were clinically intoxicated, had other painful or distracting injuries, or had focal neurologic findings. Patients in group 4 had significantly more fractures (21/387) when compared with all other patients (7/478). Patients with central neck pain or tenderness (group 3) had significantly more fractures (7/237) than patients without pain or tenderness or with these findings limited to the trapezius area (0/236). It is clear that patients who have altered mental status, abnormal examination findings, distracting injury, or pain or tenderness over the cervical spine must have cervical spine radiographs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Diverse pathologic sequelae attributed to methylene chloride or its metabolites have been reported, although a distinct bias for central nervous system effects is evident. paradoxically, detoxification of methylene chloride via the mixed-function oxidase pathway is an inherently intoxicating event. Although the anomalous conversion of methylene chloride into carbon monoxide has increased the popular awareness of methylene chloride poisoning among medical personnel, lack of experience in diagnosis and treatment of methylene chloride poisoning is widespread. This review of 26 cases spanning 50 years reveals that the industrial and domestic use of methylene chloride is equally widespread. A compendium of the clinical experience with methylene chloride poisoning is presented.\r"

Normal mice, after exposure to 200 rad of ionizing radiation, have normal or near normal splenic plaque-forming cell responses to thymus-independent type 1 Ag, but reduced responses to thymus-independent type 2 Ag. Here, we confirm and extend the original findings by using hapten-specific serum RIA to demonstrate this differential radiosensitivity is systemic. We also examined splenocytes stained with a panel of lymphocyte surface Ag by FACS analysis to determine if these functional changes are accompanied by a physical alteration of the B cell pool of irradiated mice. Single-parameter FACS analyses demonstrate a diminution in both B cell number and the heterogeneity of membrane Ag expression within the surviving B cell pool after irradiation. In contrast, T cells are relatively radioresistant as the relative percentage of T cells in the irradiated splenocyte pool increases, whereas the heterogeneity of membrane Ag expression remains constant. Multiparameter FACS analyses indicate that B cells with the sIgM much greater than sIgD phenotype are more radiosensitive than B cells of the sIgM much less than sIgD phenotype. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis of splenic sections stained with anti-IgM or anti-IgD reveal the enhanced radiosensitivity of marginal zone B cells.\r"

  ".W": "Proliferative T cell responses were elicited in a comitogenic assay when purified mAb against CD 18, CD11a, LFA-3, and CD7 were immobilized onto solid plastic surfaces together with submitogenic doses of mAb against the CD3 complex. The proliferative response was associated to the production of IL-2 and to the expression of IL-2R. We explored the possibility that a second signal provided by either PMA or a Ca2+ ionofore could replace the anti-CD3 mAb in the comitogenic assay. Interestingly, our data clearly indicate that PMA but not the ionofore was capable of mediating the co-mitogenic effect in conjunction with solid-bound mAb (CDw18, CD11a, LFA-3, and CD7). We also demonstrate that the mAb (anti-CD4 and anti-CD2) which have been previously described as co-mitogenic in combination with anti-CD3 are capable of eliciting this activating signal in the presence of PMA. These data indicate that mAb to certain cell surface differentiation Ag that in soluble form inhibit T cell function such as LFA-1, LFA-3, and CD2 can under appropriate conditions induce co-mitogenic signals on T cells. Our results support the hypothesis that several cell surface differentiation Ag may participate in conjunction with the T3-Ti complex in the transmembrane signal transduction leading to T cell activation.\r"

T cells sharing a TCR determinant defined by such an antibody presumably use the same or similar TCR V or J genes for their alpha- or beta-chains. Thus analysis with these mAb provides a tool to investigate TCR gene usage and expression. Since autoantigen specific T cells may play an important role in initiating autoimmune diseases, TCR were analyzed in different autoimmune diseases and control groups including rheumatoid arthritis, Graves disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, psoriasis, SLE, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and in nonautoimmune control diseases and normals. Purified T cells were stained by indirect immunofluorescence with three mAb to TCR variable regions: mAb S511 stains 1.8 +/- 0.9% (mean +/- 2 SD), mAb C37 stains 3.4 +/- 1.5% and mAb OT145 stains from 0 to 6% of T cells from normal donors. Several individuals were identified with expanded subsets of positive T cells. One patient with adult ITP followed during a 12-mo period consistently had elevated percentages of T cells staining with the mAb OT145 (15.9 to 24.5%). These cells were found to be exclusively CD8+. By Southern blotting DNA prepared from these OT145+, CD8+ cells, but not DNA from the patient's OT145- T cells, revealed a clonal rearrangement using a beta-chain C region probe. Thus this patient had a monoclonal expansion of CD8+, OT145+ cells. Hyperexpression of a TCR variable region, as defined by the available mAb, could not be associated with any of the diseases studied. Examination of T cells at the site of autoimmunity, such as T cells from rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid, revealed normal percentages of cells staining with these mAb. Immunoperoxidase staining of psoriatic lesional skin showed no striking enrichment of T cells bearing one or the other TCR type.\r"

With one exception, all of these mutants and the full length 17-kDa IL-1 beta were expressed as soluble protein in Escherichia coli and could be assayed for activity and receptor binding in lysates without further purification. Whereas the intact 17-kDa IL-1 beta retained full biologic activity (greater than 10(7) U/ml of lysate) and competed for binding with 125I-labeled IL-1 beta, none of the lysates containing IL-1 beta deletion mutant proteins had activity or competed for binding to receptor at significantly higher concentrations. The loss of function in the smallest C-terminal deletion mutant does not appear to be due to the direct involvement of these C-terminal residues in receptor binding because both monoclonal and polyclonal antisera directed to this region bind to IL-1 beta but do not neutralize its activity. Therefore, this region is probably indirectly involved in sustaining the structure of the receptor-binding site.\r"

  ".U": "89009693\r", 
  ".W": "Natural suppression has been described in several immunologic systems in which splenocytes are not only incapable of generating an immune response, but are also able to non-specifically suppress normal splenocyte reactivity. Natural suppressor cells exist in such transitory immune deficiency states as graft vs host disease, irradiation recovery, and during neonatal development. We have found that when splenocytes from each of these three systems were placed in culture, IFN was produced spontaneously without stimulus. This spontaneous IFN production was augmented by the addition of IL-2 or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF to cell cultures. However, these lymphokines induced little or no IFN from normal splenocytes. This unusual IFN production is especially interesting since all samples have been typed to be IFN-beta. Additionally, greater IFN-beta was produced by these spleen cells during active suppression of the MLR of normal spleen cells. In fact, antibody to IFN-beta was shown to partially reverse the natural suppression mediated by graft vs host disease splenocytes in the MLR. Thus, IFN-beta production correlates extremely well with natural suppressor states. As mice begin to recover normal immune responses in all three systems, IFN-beta ceases to be produced spontaneously in culture. These findings establish a previously undescribed IFN-beta-producing splenic phenotype and suggest that IFN-beta may contribute to the immunoregulation of natural suppressor systems.\r"

  ".W": "To develop a model for the active immunotherapy of human B cell malignancy we vaccinated tumor-bearing animals with a well defined tumor associated Ag, the idiotypic Ig. The tumor used was the mouse B cell lymphoma BCL1, a highly malignant tumor in which transfer of a single tumor cell to a syngeneic mouse is capable of causing disease and eventual death. Varying doses (10(2) to 10(4] of BCL1 cells were given to mice on day 0 of the experiment, and treatment by active immunization was initiated on day 3. Immunization with purified, tumor-derived, idiotypic IgM (BCL1 IgM) coupled to keyhole limpet hemacyanin (KLH) was highly effective in treating mice challenged with 10(2) or 10(3) BCL1 cells, but less effective in mice that had received 10(4) tumor cells. Immunization with unconjugated BCL1 IgM showed no signficant therapeutic benefit. Coupling of the IgM to KLH led to higher levels of anti-idiotypic antibody after immunization; however, the higher levels were probably not responsible for the control of the malignancy as there was no correlation in healthy immunized animals between the levels of anti-idiotypic antibody, measured immediately before tumor challenge, and survival. This lack of correlation is due to the emergence of variant tumors in such protected mice. A more significant factor in the therapeutic advantage of KLH conjugation could be that immunization with BCL1 IgM-KLH led to an earlier induction of the anti-idiotypic response than immunization with BCL1 IgM and, as the BCL1, lymphoma divides rapidly, the speed of induction of the immune response may be important in outstripping tumor cell growth. Mice with BCL1 tumour showed some evidence of immunosuppression as indicated by a reduced ability to mount an immune response against KLH. Although it is not possible to model spontaneous human lymphoma accurately, the generation of a functional anti-idiotypic response capable o eliminating a malignant animal lymphoma in situ opens up the possibility of a limited trial of active immunotherapy in selected human patients.\r"

Two leukemic cell lines, CAK1.3 and CAK4.4, were established from the primary culture of two thymic lymphoma, and surface phenotypes of these cell lines found to be H-2d and Thy-1.2+, indicating that these lymphoma cells are derived from BALB/c donor bone marrow cells. Further analyses of surface markers revealed that CAK1.3 is L3T4+ Lyt2+ IL2R-, whereas CAK4.4 is L3T4- Lyt2- IL2R+. Both CAK1.3 and CAK4.4 were transplantable into BALB/c but not AKR/J mice, further indicating that these cells are of BALB/c bone marrow donor origin. The cells were found to produce XC+-ecotropic viruses, but xenotropic and mink cell focus-forming viruses were undetectable. Inasmuch as thymic lymphomas are derived from bone marrow cells of leukemia-resistant BALB/c strain of mice under the allogeneic environment of leukemia-prone AKR/J mice, this animal model may serve as a useful tool not only for the analysis of leukemic relapse after bone marrow transplantation but also for elucidation of the mechanism of leukemogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "89009722\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism of help for resting B cell growth in MHC-restricted T-B collaboration was investigated using an in vitro polyclonal model for these T cell-B cell interactions. In the presence of rabbit anti-mouse Ig, small, size-selected B cells elicit help from syngeneic Ia-restricted Th2 cell lines specific for F(ab')2 rabbit globulin. Both Ag-presenting and bystander B cells receive signals from stimulated Th cells that lead to B cell proliferation. The results suggest that the direct activation of resting Ag-presenting and bystander B cells by Th2 cells is mediated by a similar effector mechanism. Although proliferative responses by Ag-presenting B cells are of greater magnitude, help for both Ag-presenting and bystander B cell populations is characterized by the lack of a requirement for membrane Ig cross-linking, by identical kinetics, and by the necessity for direct cell contact or close proximity with Th cells. B cell proliferation is not induced by exposure to the sequence of diffusable mediators released from a synchronized Ag-specific T-B interaction. The T cell-dependent proliferation by both B cell populations can be inhibited by excess mitomycin C-treated syngeneic \"cold target\" B cells, demonstrating a requirement for a short-range T cell-B cell interaction. mAb inhibition experiments fail to identify a role for class II, LFA-1, or CD4 membrane molecules in the delivery of help to bystander B cells. Antibody against H2d bystander class II molecules has no effect on bystander B cell proliferation at concentrations that completely block Ag presentation by H2d B cells to an H2d-restricted Th cell line. Antibodies against the cell adhesion molecule LFA-1 or the Th cell molecule CD4 do inhibit bystander B cell proliferation, but only to the extent that they block T cell activation and the induction of help. The inductive stimulus leading to resting B cell growth results from an early, short-range interaction with Th cells. B cell proliferation is supported by T cell soluble mediators as a consequence of this interaction, which is required for at least 8 hr after T cell recognition of Ag/Ia on the surface of Ag-presenting B cells.\r"

H-2/Hh-1 allogeneic or parental-strain bone marrow grafts are eliminated in a determinant specific manner by NK cells. In inbred mouse strains, seven Hh-1 alleles representing combinations of five different Hh-1 antigenic determinants are described. Each Hh-1 allele maps in the vicinity of H-2D, and the genes that map to Hh-1 are transacting regulatory genes. The expression of a particular determinant depends on the absence of the regulatory gene and the presence of the appropriate structural gene. The primary focus of this study is to ascertain whether the Hh-1 phenotype and the serologic H-2DL typing are always correlated or whether recombinant can separate the two. To achieve this, we used a panel of irradiated hosts that are able to recognize the different Hh-1 determinants on the bone marrow cells of congenic intra-H-2 recombinant donors. We report: 1) the majority of strains show a correlation between Hh-1 and H-2DL: 2) B10.RQDB and B10.WB strains dissociate Hh-1 from Lb: 3) nine H-2S/D interval recombinant strains exhibit no correlation between the H-2DL type and Hh-1 phenotype; and 4) in two strains from this group, B10.D2 (R106) and B10.RSF5, H-2S/D crossovers occurred within Hh-1r, (Hh-1 regulatory). We conclude that Hh-1r is a distinct regulatory locus mapping telomeric of H-2S and centromeric of, although probably closer to, H-2D.\r"

In this study we investigated the effects of in vivo administration of anti-I-A, anti-L3T4, and anti-lymphocyte function-associated Ag 1 (LFA-1) mAb on the development of murine cutaneous GVHD and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses evoked by local transfer of class II-MHC Ag-restricted, cloned autoreactive T cells. Prevention of cutaneous GVHD was achieved with local administration of either anti-L3T4 or anti-LFA-1 mAb, but not with anti-I-A mAb, while delayed-type hypersensitivity responses were inhibited by all the mAb. These results indicate that an I-A Ag-independent mechanism may be also operative in the development of the cutaneous GVHD, unlike the delayed-type hypersensitivity responses. Anti-LFA-1 mAb appeared to be more potent at inhibiting cutaneous GVHD rather than delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, whereas anti-L3T4 mAb inhibited equally both the responses. These results suggest that LFA-1 molecule may be involved in the epidermal invasion of T cells. Treatment with anti-LFA-1 mAb was found to be still, although less, effective at preventing cutaneous GVHD, even if the mAb was administered after the development of cutaneous GVHD.\r"

  ".W": "The opposing problems of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and failure of alloengraftment present major obstacles to the application of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) across complete MHC barriers. The addition of syngeneic T-cell-depleted (TCD) bone marrow (BM) to untreated fully allogeneic marrow inocula in lethally irradiated mice has been previously shown to provide protection from GVHD. We have used this model to study the effects of allogeneic T cells on levels of chimerism in recipients of mixed marrow inocula. The results indicate that T cells in allogeneic BM inocula eliminate both coadministered recipient-strain and radioresistant host hematopoietic elements to produce complete allogeneic chimerism without clinical GVHD. To determine the role of GVH reactivity in this phenomenon, we performed similar studies in an F1 into parent combination, in which the genetic potential for GVHD is lacking. The presence of T cells in F1 marrow inocula led to predominant repopulation with F1 lymphocytes in such chimeras, even when coadministered with TCD-recipient-strain BM. These results imply that the ability of allogeneic BM cells removed by T cell depletion to increase levels of allochimerism may be mediated by a population which is distinct from that which produces GVHD. These results may have implications for clinical BM transplantation.\r"

As previously described, these mice develop lupus-like nephritis with intraglomerular and peritubular Ig deposition, vasculitis, and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration at about 12 wk of age. As the nephritis appeared, the expression of MHC class I and II products rose, as demonstrated by absorption and by specific binding of radiolabeled antibodies. Hybridization of kidney RNA with specific probes revealed an increase in specific mRNA for MHC class I and II genes and for beta2 microglobulin. Using rat monoclonals against mouse class I and II MHC products, and goat anti-rat Ig as second antibody, we showed that the increase in renal class I and II expression was localized to the basolateral membranes of tubular cells, and, in the case of class I, in arteries and glomeruli. The sites of tubular MHC expression corresponded closely to the sites of extensive peritubular Ig deposition. High doses of cyclosporine given for 6 to 8 wk reduced the peritubular Ig deposits, renal Ia and H-2K expression, and specific mRNA for beta 2-microglobulin and MHC genes, but did not reduce anti-DNA antibody levels in serum. Thus the peritubular Ig deposits and tubular MHC induction coincided in timing and location, and in their resolution with cyclosporine. The results raise the possibility that the increase in renal MHC expression not only accompanies the renal lesions, but may play a role in their pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Autoantibodies against mitochondria occur in the sera of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with characteristic reactivity to an inner membrane protein of approximately 74 kDa. To precisely define these autoantigens, we recently cloned and sequenced a rat liver cDNA (pRMIT) that encodes for all of the epitopes recognized by Ig to the 74-kDa autoantigen. In the present study we have used this recombinant probe as a tool, in addition to purified enzymes, to demonstrate by immunoblotting that the 74-kDa mitochondrial autoantigen is dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.12), the core protein of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Furthermore, and of particular interest, inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity was demonstrated after incubation with sera from patients with PBC but not from normal volunteers or patients with chronic active hepatitis. Such inhibition was abrogated by absorption of the PBC sera with an expressing subclone of pRMIT, designated pRMIT-603. Identification of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase as the target of autoimmunity in PBC provides a reagent that can be used to determine mechanisms by which this molecule is recognized. It will allow study of whether autoimmune reactivity, at the humoral or T cell level, is the basis for the pathogenesis of PBC. Additionally, such data present evidence of functional inhibition of a critical metabolic enzyme. Dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase is well-known to mitochondrial biochemistry and, similar to identified autoantigens in other autoimmune diseases, is highly conserved in evolution.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation was undertaken to clarify the mechanism by which purified recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) potentiates neutrophil oxidative responses triggered by the chemotactic peptide, FMLP. Previous studies have shown that GM-CSF priming of neutrophil responses to FMLP is induced relatively slowly, requiring 90 to 120 min of incubation in vitro, is not associated with increased levels of cytoplasmic free Ca2+, but is associated with up-regulation of cell-surface FMLP receptors. We have confirmed these findings and further characterized the process of GM-CSF priming. We found that the effect of GM-CSF on neutrophil oxidative responsiveness was induced in a temperature-dependent manner and was not reversed when the cells were washed extensively to remove the growth factor before stimulation with FMLP. Extracellular Ca2+ was not required for functional enhancement by GM-CSF and GM-CSF alone effected no detectable alteration in the 32P-labeled phospholipid content of neutrophils during incubation in vitro. Our data indicate that GM-CSF exerts its influence on neutrophils by accelerating a process that occurs spontaneously and results in up-regulation of both cell-surface FMLP receptors and oxidative responsiveness to FMLP. Thus, the results demonstrate that, with respect to oxidative activation, circulating endstage polymorphonuclear leukocytes are nonresponsive or hyporesponsive to FMLP; functional responsiveness increases dramatically as surface FMLP receptors are gradually deployed after the cells leave the circulation. Thus, as neutrophils mature, their responsiveness to FMLP changes in a manner which may be crucial for efficient host defense. At 37 degrees C, this process is markedly potentiated by GM-CSF. We conclude that endogenous GM-CSF, released systemically or at sites of infection and inflammation, potentially plays an important role in host defense by accelerating functional maturation of responding polymorphonuclear leukocytes.\r"

Comparison of CSP gene sequences from Plasmodium falciparum suggests, based on the lack of silent (i.e., synonymous) substitutions, that polymorphism is being biologically selected for in the field. Thus, variation in T cell determinant sequences may actually be a means of immune evasion. The central question addressed here is whether or not the natural polymorphisms found in three identified T cell determinants in the CSP gene of P. falciparum are immunologically significant with regard to T cell stimulation. In support of the immune evasion hypothesis, we show here that animals immunized with peptides based on one sequence (i.e., the 7G8 isolate) will not significantly respond when challenged with variant peptides based on other CSP sequences (i.e., the LE5 and We1 isolates). Polymorphism in T cell determinants thus indicates that infection with sporozoites will not necessarily boost immune (antibody help and/or proliferative) responses stimulated by prior infections or by a particular vaccine construct based on these determinants. The implications of these findings in regard to vaccine development are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Filarial infections induce a spectrum of disease in their natural hosts, and by correlating immunity found in individuals with their disease pattern, one may delineate non-pathogenic, protective mechanisms. Loa loa is causal of mild to moderate pathology, and it is unique among the human filaria in that adult worms are occasionally visible during subconjunctival migration. To study immune mechanisms controlling microfilaremia, sera from 15 subjects with amicrofilaremic occult loiasis (OL) were compared with sera from 10 subjects with microfilaremic loiasis (ML) microfilaremia, (greater than 4000/ml) for their reactions with living microfilariae (mf). An IFA was first used to detect antibodies able to bind to the surface of living L. loa mf. ML subjects either did not react (7/10) or reacted only very weakly (3/10). Highly reactive sera were found only in OL subjects; 7/15 gave very bright fluorescence, 5/15 gave moderate reactions, and 3/15 were negative. Most of these antibodies were of the IgG class. Sera from all subjects were also reacted with living mf in an antibody-dependent cellular adherence test using normal leukocytes. Sera that were strongly positive in IFA showed strong adherence and IFA-negative sera were non-reactive. To identify the Ag involved, mf were surface iodinated, detergent-extracted Ag were immunoprecipitated, and Mr was determined on SDS-PAGE. Several OL sera, all highly reactive in the above tests, precipitated a 23-kDa molecule with which all ML sea failed to react. Sera from a mandrill experimentally infected with L. loa also precipitated the 23-kDa Ag when taken post-patency. In conclusion, it appears that certain people who control L. loa microfilaremia have high levels of IgG antibodies that bind to a surface Ag of 23 kDa and are able to mediate cellular adherence.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified a gene whose expression appears to be associated with a late stage in the differentiation of B lymphocytes into antibody secreting cells, as shown by using the inducible B cell lymphoma, CH12. Restriction mapping and partial sequencing of a cDNA clone isolated by subtraction analysis demonstrated that the clone, SC34, represents an envelope (env) gene transcript of a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). In CH12 cells and in normal B cells, levels of MMTV RNA were increased after stimulation with LPS. The env transcript was the predominant MMTV RNA species and increased more dramatically than did levels of the genomic transcript. In differentiating CH12 cells, env transcripts increased as much as 20-fold above levels found in replicating, antibody nonsecreting CH12 cells. The major increase in expression appeared to be associated with B cell differentiation and not replication. By Southern blot analysis, only bands characteristic of endogenous proviruses were found in CH12, indicating that viral sequences were not amplified in this cell line. Restriction mapping indicated that the SC34 cDNA clone was a product of the Mtv-9 locus. Mtv-9 previously was shown to encode a complete MMTV provirus on chromosome 12, on which Ig heavy chain genes also are located. Increases in MMTV transcripts followed distinct kinetics and were quantitatively different from changes in immunoglobulin gene products. The expression of env RNA appears to more accurately reflect differentiation to antibody secretion in CH12 cells than does the expression of immunoglobulin gene transcripts.\r"

Our results indicate that this is also true for insulin. Unexpectedly, we find that protein synthesis is required for optimal accessory cell-dependent processing of insulin and other proteins by adherent macrophages. Treatment of APC with inhibitors of protein synthesis, before and during exposure to Ag, inhibits their subsequent ability to activate murine T cell hybridomas. Experiments are described which suggest that this effect is localized to intracellular processing of Ag rather than uptake or presentation, per se. Inhibition is reversible, and is not observed in special situations where intracellular processing of Ag is not required. A distinct lag period is required for inhibition of processing after inhibition of macrophage protein synthesis. One possible interpretation is that protein synthesis is necessary for maintenance of a labile protein crucial for intracellular processing of Ag. Alternatively, the susceptibility of processing to inhibitors of protein synthesis may reflect an obligate intracellular association of Ag and newly synthesized class II histocompatibility molecules.\r"

  ".U": "89009786\r", 
  ".W": "Graft rejection presents a major obstacle for transplantation of T cell-depleted bone marrow in HLA-mismatched patients. In a primate model, after conditioning exactly as for leukemia patients, it was shown that over 99% of the residual host clonable T cells are concentrated in the spleen on day 5 after completion of cytoreduction. We have now corroborated these findings in a mouse model. After 9-Gy total body irradiation (TBI), the total number of Thy-1.2+ cells in the spleen reaches a peak between days 3 and 4 after TBI. The T cell population is composed of both L3T4 (helper) and Lyt-2 (suppressor) T cells, the former being the major subpopulation. Specific booster irradiation to the spleen (5 Gy twice) on days 2 and 4 after TBI greatly enhances production of donor-type chimera after transplantation of T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow. Similar enhancement can be achieved by splenectomy on day 3 or 4 after TBI but not if splenectomy is performed 1 day before TBI or 1 day after TBI, strengthening the hypothesis that, after lethal TBI in mice, the remaining host T cells migrate from the periphery to the spleen. These results suggest that a delayed booster irradiation to the spleen may be beneficial as an additional immunosuppressive agent in the conditioning of leukemia patients, in order to reduce the incidence of bone marrow allograft rejection.\r"

  ".W": "The immunorestorative capacities of human (hu) IL-1 beta or its synthetic fragment 163-171 (VQGEESNDK) were assessed in vivo in mice immunodepressed by aging, sublethal irradiation, or both. Subcutaneous administration of hu rIL-1 beta into immunodepressed animals immediately after carrier (horse red blood cells, HRBC) priming could restore to normal levels Th cell activity. This was measured as the ability of spleen cells from HRBC-primed mice to induce a hapten-specific antibody response in spleen cells from nonimmune mice in vitro stimulated with the hapten-carrier conjugate TNP-HRBC. In parallel, the ability of spleen cells from hu rIL-1 beta-treated immunodepressed animals to produce T cell growth factor activity upon in vitro mitogen stimulation was also increased significantly as compared to that of untreated mice and approached that of immunocompetent controls. The immunorestorative activity of hu rIL-1 beta on Th cell activity and T cell growth factor production could be mimicked by the synthetic nonapeptide 163-171 which, at the doses used, produced in most instances even greater effects than the whole protein. Although the optimal immunorestorative doses of the 163-171 peptide were several orders of magnitude higher than those of hu rIL-1 beta, the complete lack of IL-1-like inflammatory and toxic effects suggests that the synthetic hu IL-1 beta fragment may be successfully used as immunomodulating agent in the therapy of T cell immunodeficiencies.\r"

  ".W": "CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) is a member of the leukocyte integrin family, a group of receptors that have been implicated in various effector functions and cellular collaboration in the immune response. It has been shown previously that CD11b/CD18 on cells of monocyte and myeloid lineage appears to undergo rapid activation and acquire new functional receptor specificities after exposure to selected agonists such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP). We now show that ADP induces a reconformation of the CD11b/CD18 receptor with exposure of new epitopes characteristics of this activated state. By direct binding studies, flow cytometry, and immunoprecipitation experiments, it has been found that the mAb 7E3 reacts with CD11b/CD18 only after ADP-stimulation of the cell suspension. The activated state of CD11b/CD18 induced by ADP and recognized by 7E3 can also be recapitulated by agonists inducing transients in cytosolic Ca2+ such as the chemoattractant FMLP. Moreover, this process of receptor activation does not involve quantitative mobilization of the subcellular storage pool of CD11b/CD18 to the plasma membrane. Because 7E3 also recognizes a qualitative, ADP-mediated activated state of the platelet adhesion receptor GP IIb/IIIa, it is suggested that transients in cytosolic Ca2+ might represent early secondary events for a general pathway of rapid activation of integrin receptors and, as such, represent important signals for cellular interactions in the immune response.\r"

A lambda gt11 library of Mycobacterium leprae DNA was screened with M. leprae-reactive human T cell clones as probes, allowing the isolation of a M. leprae DNA clone encoding the unidentified Ag. This DNA clone differs in restriction maps from those previously identified by antibody probes and encodes an epitope that is unique to vaccine strains of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin and pathogenic mycobacteria. This method is generally applicable and should expedite the study of Ag and epitopes important to the T cell response in infections and in autoimmune diseases.\r"

This immunologic defect may partially explain the difficulty with which natural immunity to falciparum malaria develops and may have important implications for the efficacy of potential malaria vaccines in endemic areas. To investigate the basis of this immune defect, we have examined the capacity of PBMC from patients with acute falciparum malaria to produce IL-2 and to express I1-2R in response to Ag stimulation. The effect of exogenous IL-1 and IL-2 on lymphocyte proliferation was studied. Soluble IL-2R levels were measured in acute and convalescent sera. Our results showed that no detectable IL-2 was produced and no IL-2R were expressed by PBMC in response to MA during the acute infection. IL-2 production and IL-2R expression were also depressed when PBMC were exposed to streptococcal Ag. The specific immune defect was not reconstituted by the addition of graded doses of purified human IL-1 or IL-2 and could not be attributed to suppressor adherent cells. In contrast to the absence of IL-2 and cell-bound IL-2R, circulating soluble IL-2R was elevated in acute sera. These findings suggest that the lack of IL-2, through either a defect in its production or inhibition of its activity, may be the basis of the Ag-specific immune unresponsiveness in acute P. falciparum malaria.\r"

The mAb were selected for study based on their reaction with group A streptococci, pep M5 protein, and/or M6 Escherichia coli protein. Further analysis by Western immunoblot or competitive inhibition ELISA revealed that there were two types of antibodies: one type that reacted with myosin and DNA and the other type that reacted with myosin, keratin, and/or actin. The specificities of these human mAb are similar to specificities observed in our previous studies of murine mAb reactive with group A streptococci and heart Ag. For comparison, anti-myosin antibodies were affinity purified from the sera of infected or acute rheumatic fever patients and were shown to react with myosin and DNA as well as with group A streptococci and M protein. To affinity purify these antibodies from normal sera, five times the amount of sera was required to obtain detectable quantities. These data suggest that the human mAb reactive with group A streptococci and myosin reflect the antibodies seen in sera from infected patients or acute rheumatics and that the B lymphocyte clones capable of producing these cross-reactive antibodies are also present in normal individuals.\r"

Postmortem examination performed on 35 mice that died after i.n. challenge showed that all had evidence of disseminated infections, and group A streptococci were recovered from the cervical lymph nodes, blood, spleen, liver, and brain. To determine vaccine efficacy, heat-killed M24 strep or pep M24 were administered i.n. to groups of mice. Whole, heat-killed streptococci and pep M24 administered locally protected mice against death from i.n. challenge infections with homologous M24 strep. The whole cell vaccine also protected against i.n. challenge infections with heterologous type 6 streptococci.

C3H/HeJ mice, which have previously been described to be LPS hyporesponsive and have a defect in Fc gamma R function, did not respond to anti-idiotype therapy as well as C3H/HeN normal mice. This defect was completely corrected in animals treated simultaneously with IFN. Anti-idiotype mAb that was cleaved into F(ab')2 fragments no longer had any antitumor activity alone and could not be enhanced by IFN therapy. These results suggest that antibody is functioning through Fc gamma R-bearing effector cells that are enhanced by IFN therapy. Synergy between IFN and anti-idiotype mAb was maintained in nude mice lacking classical T cells but was reduced in C3H beige mice lacking classical NK/killer cells. IFN did not increase idiotype expression on the tumor cells but did increase H-2 expression. Although we have previously shown that rIFN-alpha A/D can directly kill 38C13 in vitro, an IFN-resistant subclone derived from 38C13, SIR-1, was equally or more responsive to human rIFN-alpha A/D in vivo and had a synergistic antitumor response to combination IFN and anti-idiotype therapy, indicating that IFN acts primarily through host mediated effects rather than direct effects.\r"

EL-4 clones are able to suppress up to 80% of the total IgM responses in both systems, as well as to help. Suppression and help fluctuate between high and low levels with the numbers of EL-4 cells placed into tissue cultures. In Poisson plots, this is reflected as a \"typical curve\": usually one or two frequencies are estimated (e.g., integral of 1/4 and approximately 1/1000 for suppression and approximately 1/6 and approximately 1/200 for help), which appear regulated with increasing numbers of cells seeded. Control experiments showed that EL-4 cells need to be alive to exert the effects. EL-4 cells do not serve as additional antigen, do not induce an isotype switch and are not cytotoxic. Help and suppression are not restricted by the MHC. Help requires the presence of a small number of normal T cells in the assay system, indicating that EL-4 cells do not replace specific helper T cells. When a number of control cell lines were analyzed under identical circumstances, similar effects were observed with most long term T cell lines or clones expressing a T cell receptor, whereas cells of non-T lineages and T cells not expressing a T cell receptor did not show the phenomena. The results suggest a functional plasticity of T cells, dependent on cell numbers and the assay system used, and expressed via T cell communication.\r"

  ".W": "CD43 (large sialoglycoprotein) is a heavily glycosylated protein expressed on virtually all thymus-derived lymphocytes, on a subpopulation of B cells and on granulocytes. Recently, an anti-CD43 mAb (L10) was shown to induce proliferation in T cells comparable to that induced by anti-CD3. The L10 antibody was reported to react with both sialylated and desialylated CD43. In order to further elucidate the role of CD43 in various T cell functions we have studied the biologic properties of two other mAb (B1B6 and E11B, IgG1) directed against sialic acid-dependent epitopes on CD43. Addition of low amounts of antibody (5 to 10 ng/ml) to freshly isolated T cells or to T cell lines resulted in a rapid clustering of the cells. Fab fragments were also active albeit at a 10-fold higher concentration. Aggregation was dependent on active cell metabolism (inhibited by azide and at low temperatures), on the presence of divalent cations (Mg2+) and was inhibited by antibodies to CD18 but not by antibodies to CD11a (leukocyte function-associated Ag-1 alpha). B1B6 and E11B were poorly mitogenic when added alone in soluble form to PBL or to T cells. However, supernatants from cultures of PBL treated with B1B6 for 2 days contained IL-2 activity. No increase in the number of CD25+ cells was seen during the same period. Exogenously added IL-2 did not synergize with B1B6 or E11B in activation of PBL, whereas proliferation was significantly increased by the addition of the antibodies to activation systems with low endogenous production of IL-2 (PMA or soluble anti-CD3). The anti-CD43 antibodies amplified T cell proliferative responses induced by Con A or leukoagglutinin from Phaseolus vulgaris. F(ab')2 fragments enhanced proliferation significantly better than Fab fragments suggesting that cross-linking of CD43 molecules was an essential features of the amplifying signal. Compared with cultures activated by Con A alone, an increased number of CD25+ cells and of blast cells as well as an increased IL-2 production was observed in cultures activated by B1B6-Con A. The results indicate that regulatory signals, which may function to modify homo- or heterotypic T cell adhesion as well as autocrine production of IL-2, can be transduced through CD43.\r"

A suppressor-enriched population of BM cells can constitutively produce a soluble mediator with similar suppressor activity and kinetics as the suppressor cells. This novel BM-derived suppressor factor (BDSF) suppresses human in vitro primary antibody responses as well as lectin-activated proliferative responses. The mediator (BDSF) has a Mr of less than 1.5 kDa, contains a lipid component, and is insensitive to indomethacin treatment. The BM cells producing the factor bear the HNK-1 surface marker but not T, B, or macrophage markers. The ability of BDSF to suppress Ag-dependent IgM responses during the inductive phase makes it an ideal molecule with the potential to regulate early immune and hemopoietic events within the BM compartment.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the ability of the human lymphokine leukocyte inhibitory factor (LIF) to modulate neutrophil-endothelial cell (EC) adherence. EC were cultured from collagenase-treated human umbilical cord veins and grown in complete medium supplemented with EC growth factor. Adherence was measured as the percent of 51Cr-labeled neutrophils remaining adherent to the EC after gentle lavage. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were pretreated with LIF (0.5 to 8 U/ml), extensively washed, and allowed to interact with the EC monolayers. LIF was demonstrated to induce an increase in the capacity of PMN to bind EC in a dose-dependent fashion (from 30.9 +/- 2.1% adherence with control-treated PMN to 68.6 +/- 3.0% at 4 U LIF; p less than 0.001). In subsequent experiments we demonstrated that 10 min was a sufficient preincubation time for LIF to modulate the capacity of the PMN to adhere to EC. LIF has previously been observed to up-regulate expression of C receptor type 3 on PMN, a receptor which has been shown to be involved in PMN-EC binding. Exposure of PMN to anti-C receptor type 3 antibody before their incubation with LIF abrogated its effect as did inactivation of LIF by an esterase inhibitor. We also investigated the ability of LIF to stimulate EC to bind untreated PMN. EC were pretreated with LIF (0.25 to 4 U/ml), extensively washed, and adherence measured as before. LIF was shown to induce a dose-dependent increase in the capacity of the EC to bind PMN (from 28.8 +/- 3.1% for untreated EC to 91.1 +/- 4.0% at 4 U LIF; p less than 0.001). Modulation of EC function required a minimum of 30 min and was inhibited in the presence of cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Neither anti-TNF-alpha or -beta antibodies nor polymixin B abrogated the augmentation by LIF. However, anti-IL-1 antibody partially inhibited the stimulation of EC adhesiveness by LIF, suggesting the possible involvement of this cytokine. These studies provide further evidence that LIF may mediate an important pro-inflammatory role in vivo.\r"

Both epitopes differed from epitopes recognized by induced antitubulin antibodies.

Pf200 does not bind to neuraminidase-treated E, indicating the interaction is dependent on sialic acid residues. Binding is inhibited by soluble glycophorin and selective mAb against the glycosylated domain of glycophorin, but not by a mAb against the peptide domain of glycophorin. mAb.5B1 previously identified as reacting with Pf 200, blocks binding of the protein to the E. Binding between Pf200 and the E is not high affinity, as Pf200 can be released from the surface by 0.25 M NaCl.\r"

The aim was to identify T cell epitopes within the Ag. Most of the synthetic peptides from the nonrepeat regions of Pf155/RESA were selected for study on the basis of their tendency to form amphipathic alpha-helices. Peptides representing immunodominant B cell epitopes were also tested. Three-quarters of the Melanesian donors responded to the recombinant peptides (Ag 1505 and Ag 632-100) and to the 8 x 4 mer, a synthetic peptide representative of the 3' repeat region. Whereas all the remaining eight peptides tested elicited a response in at least one donor, three peptides (M40, M42, and BTA3) representing sequences in the nonrepeat regions showed greatest promise as potentially useful T epitopes. Responses in control donors were also observed to most of the peptides but the percentage of responders was lower. T cell bulk lines specific to Ag 1505 and Ag 632-100 were established. All donors were HLA tissue typed, but no obvious correlations between responsiveness and HLA type were observed. Our results suggest that there are T cell epitopes within and outside the repeat regions of Pf155/RESA.\r"

Most of the mononuclear cells had the morphologic appearance of large lymphocytes. Immunoperoxidase studies with mAb showed that most of the mononuclear cells were W3/25+; many were W3/13+ and a small proportion were OX8+. Many of the mononuclear cells were Ia+. T cells were propagated in IL-2-containing media from small fragments of renal tissue with pyelonephritic lesions. Most of the propagated cells were W3/25+; fewer than (10%) were OX8+ or Ia+. T cells propagated from kidneys infected with E. coli responded, in proliferation assays, to the infecting strain or other E. coli strains, but not to P. aeruginosa or enterococci. The response to non-p-pilus-bearing E. coli was as great or greater than to E. coli with adhesins. T cells derived from lesions induced by P. aeruginosa responded to the infecting organisms, but not to E. coli. The response to the infecting organism (E. coli or P. aeruginosa) was MHC restricted, as indicated by the requirement for syngeneic APC. The results show that large numbers of T lymphocytes, especially with the \"helper/inducer\" phenotype, accumulate in the lesions of acute pyelonephritis in rats. Among the infiltrating T lymphocytes are activated cells and cells with specific reactivity to the infecting bacteria (or related strains). The findings indicate that T lymphocytes play a role within the kidney in response to the invading bacteria.\r"

Cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg), administered in combination with idiotype immunization to mice bearing 10-day-old, 1 to 2 cm diameter s.c. tumors, resulted in a significant prolongation of survival as compared with either cyclophosphamide or immunization alone and yielded approximately 50% cures. Additional studies combining active immunotherapy with surgical excision of the primary s.c. tumor nodule were less effective than combination chemoimmunotherapy, indicating that reduction of tumor burden was necessary, but not sufficient for effective treatment of established 38C13 lymphoma.\r"

The mechanisms associated with IL-2- and IFN-mediated augmentation of NK function are largely unknown. In order to learn more about the regulation of NK activity, we have studied changes in gene expression that occur upon treatment of a cloned line of NK cells (NK 3.3) with rIL-2 and rIFN-beta. Both IL-2 and IFN-beta induced rapid augmentation of lysis mediated by NK 3.3, which was significant within 1 h, peaked at 6 h of treatment, and declined by 12 h. This enhancement of lytic function was independent of proliferation and associated with a corresponding increase in steady state levels of RNA coding for both the nuclear proto-oncogene c-myb and for the IL-2R. These changes were specific in that RNA levels of another nuclear proto-oncogene, c-myc, were increased by IL-2 but not by IFN-beta, whereas HLA class I RNA levels were relatively unchanged by either IL-2 or IFN-beta treatment. Treatment of NK 3.3 with the combination of IL-2 and IFN enhanced both lysis and c-myb expression in an additive fashion. These findings suggest that c-myb may play a regulatory role in the cytolytic activity of NK cells.\r"

In this study, the nature of fibronectin and the site of its synthesis were explored in 10 basal cell carcinomas of the nodulo-ulcerative type by immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. First, simultaneous localization of epithelial tumor cell islands and fibronectin epitopes was carried out by double immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal anti-cytokeratin antibodies and polyclonal fibronectin antibodies, the latter recognizing both the cellular and plasma types of the protein. Large amounts of fibronectin were deposited in the basal cell carcinoma stroma, with the highest concentration present in the immediate proximity of the epithelial cell islands. Immunofluorescence with a monoclonal anti-fibronectin antibody, which is directed against the ED-domain of cellular fibronectin and does not recognize the plasma type of fibronectin, revealed essentially the same staining pattern as that obtained with the polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibody. This observation suggested that fibronectin in BCC was predominantly of the cellular type. Second, in situ hybridizations, utilizing a human fibronectin specific cDNA, demonstrated that the highest concentration of fibronectin mRNA was found in the most peripheral cell layer of the epithelial tumor islands. The presence of fibronectin mRNAs in the tumor cells of the central regions of the islands, as well as within occasional stromal cells, was also noted. Thus, two lines of evidence suggest that the epithelial tumor cells are predominantly responsible for the synthesis and deposition of fibronectin in basal cell carcinoma. The presence of fibronectin may explain the characteristic biologic behavior of basal cell carcinomas, including low degree of metastatic potential and local destructive nature of the tumors.\r"

The IgA deposition was in a tubular pattern underlying the villous and crypt epithelial basement membranes and in the lamina propria. This IgA deposition diminished or was not detectable in DH patients under a GFD for a year, and became detectable under gluten challenge in three DH patients. One patient with celiac disease and IgA deficiency, four with other intestinal diseases, and four without jejunal damage had neither jejunal IgA deposition nor circulating IgA anti-jejunal antibody. The deposition of IgA in the jejunum seemed to be correlated with the presence of IgA anti-jejunal antibody in the serum and with the presence of jejunal damage, but the degree of jejunal atrophy, the titer of the anti-jejunal antibody, and the intensity of jejunal IgA deposition in DH patient were not clearly related. Deposition of IgA in the jejunum in DH did not clearly correlate with the activity of the skin symptoms and thus may not be directly related to the pathogenesis of the skin disease of DH.\r"

The cell release was optimal at pH 7-9 but was significant also at pH 6. The rate of cell release increased with increasing temperature, but was decreased abruptly at temperatures above 50 degrees C. The cell dissociation could be inhibited by aprotinin (Trasylol) and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Thus, it is evident that the unipolar cell dissociation in this system is mediated by an enzymatically catalyzed process, most likely with the involvement of a serine protease with an alkaline pH-optimum. The in vitro cell release shows properties indicating that it may be mediated by mechanisms also active in vivo.\r"

Xenografts pretreated with either allantoin or anthralin showed an increase in the major 7R- and 7S-BPDE I adducts compared to only BPDE I treatment. Likewise, we observed an increase in the quantity of different minor adducts. The ratios between the minor and major adducts in the pretreated grafts remained consistent with the ratio in the grafts treated with BPDE I only. We conclude that these modulators induce cells in the xenograft to enter S phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, we observed that these compounds altered the quantity of the minor carcinogen-DNA adducts without altering the overall ratios between the major 7R- and 7S-BPDE I-dpGp adducts and the minor carcinogen-DNA adducts.\r"

Important discrepancies were detected for the two methods. When the hand was lowered by 40 cm a 40% decrease in blood flow was detected by the 133-Xenon method, while a 60% decrease was seen by the laser Doppler technique. Lowering the hand by 50 cm resulted in no further blood flow decrease when using the 133-Xenon method, but an 80% blood flow decrease was recorded with the laser Doppler method. A marked decrease in blood flow was recorded by the laser Doppler technique in hands that were sympathectomized or a hand that was subjected to a nerve blockade, strategies which should eliminate the orthostatic vasoconstrictor response of superficial cutaneous vessels. The 133-Xenon technique did not detect any blood flow changes in hands without sympathetic tone. We found the laser Doppler flowmetry technique unsatisfactory for measurement of blood flow changes that occur in nutritional vessels as this method measures total skin blood flow including non-capillary vessels.\r"

  ".W": "Prenatal diagnosis is now possible for junctional and recessive dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa (EB); however, there is no similar published experience for dominant dystrophic EB, although data with KF-1 monoclonal antibody suggests that both forms of dystrophic EB can be identified at least postnatally with this unique probe. We now report our experience with light microscopy, electron microscopy, immunofluorescence mapping, and KF-1 and LH 7:2 monoclonal antibodies, in both a mother with dominant dystrophic EB and her fetus at risk, and in a fetus previously shown to be affected with recessive dystrophic EB. KF-1 and LH 7:2 antigens were absent in recessive dystrophic EB fetal skin, identical to findings observed postnatally. LH 7:2 was normally expressed in a mother with dominant dystrophic EB and in her fetus at risk for this disease. In contrast, while KF-1 antigen was abnormally expressed in the affected mother, it was normally expressed in only 1/7 fetal biopsies despite the fact that this fetus was shown by light and electron microscopy and immunofluorescence mapping to be unaffected with dominant dystrophic EB. We conclude that 1) transmission electron microscopy can be used to prenatally exclude the diagnosis of dominant dystrophic EB (Cockayne-Touraine variety), 2) immunofluorescence mapping is an accurate technique for prenatal as well as postnatal diagnosis of EB, and 3) KF-1 cannot by itself be used as an accurate probe for the prenatal diagnosis of dominant dystrophic EB, due to the apparent variability in the time for the normal expression of KF-1 in fetal skin during the second trimester.\r"

Both endopeptidase and aminopeptidase activities were strongly inhibited by metal chelating agents and Copper and Zinc ions but were insensitive to Tissue Inhibitor of Metallo Proteases (TIMP). These protease activities coeluted on ion exchange chromatography (DEAE Tris acryl M) and were further separated by high-performance liquid chromatography HPLC (TSK 3000 SW). The endopeptidase activity, designated as HSF E1, was eluted at the position corresponding to an Mr equal to 94,000. It has only a limited elastinolytic potential as evaluated on 3H insoluble elastin, but it extensively degrades human skin elastic fibers as directly assessed on human skin tissue sections and further quantitated by automated image analysis. The level of HSF E1 increases with the number of fibroblast passages.\r"

  ".U": "89009963\r", 
  ".W": "Grafts of allogeneic dermis plus autologous epidermal cell cultures were used to replace extensively burned skin. Cryopreserved split-thickness cadaveric skin was grafted onto debrided burn wound, and autologous keratinocytes were cultured from uninjured donor sites. Several weeks later, allograft epidermis was abraded and replaced with the keratinocyte cultures. The final grafts were thus composites of autologous cultured epidermis and allogeneic dermis. In a case with 28 months follow-up, reconstitution of the dermal-epidermal (BMZ.1) and microvascular (BMZ.2) basement membrane zones was studied immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally. Immediately before grafting, thawed cryopreserved skin reacted with antibodies against laminin and type IV collagen in normal patterns. Twenty-nine days after grafting, BMZ.1 reacted weakly with both antibodies, and anticollagen type IV reactivity was absent from BMZ.2. Antilaminin reactivity of BMZ.2, however, was moderately intense, consistent with recent neovascularization. On day 29, the allograft epidermis was replaced with autologous keratinocyte cultures. Twenty-five days later (54 d after allografting), staining of both BMZs was intense with both antibodies. Ultrastructurally, at day 76 (47 d after culture placement) BMZ.1 revealed only small hemidesmosomes, few incipient anchoring fibrils, and a discontinuous lamina densa. BMZ.2, however, was fully reconstituted. By 124 d, both BMZs appeared normal. Observations in the dermis at 76 d included the presence of lymphocytes, organellar debris, and hyperactive collagen fibrillogenesis, all indicative of dermal remodelling. The microvasculature was well differentiated, but no elastic fibers or nerves were found. In the epidermis, melanocytes and evidence of melanosome transfer were seen at 5, 47, and 95 d after grafting of keratinocyte cultures. We conclude that the composite procedure reconstitutes skin with excellent textural and histologic qualities.\r"

Here we show by immunohistochemistry and immunoelectronmicroscopy that DAF is on the periphery of elastic fibers, and that it appears to be associated with some microfibrillar elements that cover the fibers. That DAF is a component of these microfibrils is also suggested by studies of lesional skin from anetoderma, a disease characterized by destruction of elastic fibers. In two patients we found a network of residual fine fibers in the dermis that stain with antibodies against DAF and fibrillin (one of the proteins known to be present in the microfibrils of elastin), but do not stain with antibodies to elastin. Western blot analysis of dermal extracts with monoclonal antibodies to DAF identified a 67 kDa molecule, slightly smaller than membrane DAF, and similar in size to soluble DAF found in secretions. It is possible that together with vitronectin, an inhibitor of the membrane attack complex recently identified in association with elastin, DAF prevents damage of elastic fibers by complement.\r"

Specifically, a group of organisms has been identified that produce large amounts of beta-lactamase and appear borderline resistant. These organisms have been called \"occult resistant\" or \"acquired oxacillin-resistant\" S. aureus (AORSA). A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the implication of this in vitro phenomenon in managing patients with AORSA infections. Among 134 patients with S. aureus infections, 89 were infected with oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (OSSA), 26 with AORSA, and 19 with oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA). There were no significant differences in outcomes when OSSA and AORSA infections were treated with PRP (chi 2MH = .990; P = .32). These results do not suppor the contention that AORSA infections should be managed differently from OSSA infections. Identifying AORSA may not be helpful in guiding antimicrobial therapy or predicting the outcome of infections with AORSA.\r"

In the present study, IgG that was isolated from the serum of a human volunteer after vaccination with III-GBS polysaccharide contained very high levels of III-GBS antibody. Small amounts of this hyperimmune preparation added in vitro significantly increased the opsonophagocytosis of III-GBS in neonatal sera in the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Furthermore, small volumes of the preparation were protective in mouse and neonatal rat models of III-GBS disease. The administration of such hyperimmune human IgG preparations should be considered for preventing or treating III-GBS disease in infants.\r"

Isolates of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei also did not react with the probe. The low-level cytotoxic activities associated with the mutant S. dysenteriae type 1 strains or with the virulent S. flexneri and S. sonnei strains are neutralizable with antiserum to Shiga toxin; however, these cytotoxic activities are not determined by the genes encoding classic Shiga toxin.\r"

Deficiency of A1AT can result in infantile cirrhosis and premature emphysema, both of which have a high degree of morbidity and significant mortality. Although synthesized primarily by the liver, A1AT has been histochemically localized in monocytes and macrophages in vitro and has been shown to be produced in tissue culture of monocyte-macrophage origin. This study was planned to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the in vivo monocyte-macrophage system contribution to serum A1AT. We used bone marrow transplantation (BMT) as an experimental method because there is commanding evidence that after engraftment, the monocyte-macrophage system of the recipient is replaced by that of donor origin. Protease inhibitor (Pi) typing was done on 150 potential BMT recipients and on their potential donors before transplantation. From these initial recipients, 92 eventually underwent transplantation, and 11 recipient-donor pairs, in which each donor's Pi type contained a band not in the recipient's Pi type, were chosen for the study. Six recipients survived beyond 100 days after BMT, and in these cases the donor contained either an S or an M2 band in his or her Pi type not present in the recipient. Using a silver stain method on diluted serum of known M1M2 and MS types, we were able to detect a 2% dilution of the S band and a 25% dilution of the M2 band. When the same method was applied to gels used in typing recipient Pi after BMT, we were unable to detect any contribution to serum A1AT by the donor monocyte-macrophage system.\r"

Exactly 100 years ago MacKenzie, with Norris Wolfenden, founded 'The Journal of Laryngology and Rhinology'. 'Otology' was not added to the title until 1892, the year MacKenzie died. I shall return to this theme later. It is also exactly 100 years since, in 1887, MacKenzie was asked by Queen Victoria to examine her son-in-law, Frederick, Crown Prince of Germany. The controversy and subsequent recrimination which flowed from the management of Frederick's laryngeal lesion I shall leave to future lecturers to assess. It is as the founder of British laryngology that he should be remembered. As early as 1863 he had started the Metropolitan Free Dispensary for Diseases of the Throat and Loss of Voice, the first institution of its kind in the world. He wrote authoritatively on diseases of the throat and invented many instruments for the difficult art of indirect laryngeal and pharyngeal surgery. He received his Knighthood, also in 1887.\r"

There was a significant reduction in rhinorrhoea during active treatment, with the most noticeable effect being in the moderate-to-severe rhinorrhoea group. No significant effect was noted on nasal obstruction or sneezing and no serious side-effects were seen. A carry-on effect was noted when active treatment was used initially. However, the group given active treatment following placebo had a better result overall. A strong placebo effect was also noted in both groups, in keeping with a trial of this order.\r"

Clinical characteristics that may be discriminatory for malignant causes were also investigated. A retrospective analysis was performed of 82 patients who underwent biopsy for unexplained lymphadenopathy from 1982 to 1984; data regarding the incidence of unexplained lymphadenopathy and the referral rate for this problem were obtained from registration projects. A total of 29 malignant lymphadenopathies were identified for a prior probability of 1.1 percent and a posterior (after referral) probability of 11 percent. The ability of the family physician to refer malignant cases within four weeks after initial consultation (sensitivity of referral) was 80 to 90 percent; 91 to 98 percent of benign cases were not referred (specificity of referral). An increased likelihood of malignancy was associated with age over 40 years (4 percent) and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (50 percent). The incidence of malignancy in patients presenting with unexplained lymphadenopathy to the family physicians is very low (1 to 2 percent). Nevertheless, despite the paucity of validated discriminatory factors, the family physicians perform a reasonably effective selection process toward referral and biopsy.\r"

In addition, there is evidence of an increase in various autoantibodies as a person ages. In recent years evidence has been presented of a genetic basis to this declining system. Because of these changes and because severe infections present more subtly in the elderly patient than in the young, the physician's suspicion for serious infections in the elderly should be heightened and immunization programs in the elderly adhered to.\r"

In comparison with others born in Maine during those years, more infants in these presumed low socioeconomic groups died, were transferred immediately to other hospitals, had low birthweights, or were readmitted to a hospital within 30 days of birth. Of all deliveries, 105 family physicians or general practitioners performed 22 percent, 82 obstetricians performed 69 percent, and 16 osteopathic physicians performed 5 percent; but of Medicaid deliveries, obstetricians delivered only 59 percent, while family physicians-general practitioners and osteopaths did commensurately more. The decreased proportion of Medicaid patients cared for by obstetricians was especially prominent in Maine's urban hospital service areas. Pediatricians, on the other hand, cared for the same proportion of Medicaid children as they did all children in all hospital service areas in the state. The distribution of low socioeconomic, higher obstetric risk patient groups among various medical specialties as demonstrated in these data should be considered by health planners, malpractice insurers, and health insurers including state Medicaid programs.\r"

  ".W": "The history of medical education during the period of 1870 to 1926 is examined in the context of current issues confronting education in the forensic laboratory sciences. Medical education was radically altered during this period, changing from a rudimentary lecture/apprenticeship system into its modern form. Although the motivating forces had developed over some time, the actual change was quite rapid. By examining how this change occurred, we gain insight into how changes in our own profession might be initiated. Parallels between our current situation and that in medical education 117 years ago include: (1) the primary burden of professional education is borne outside the university in an apprenticeship system, (2) the apprenticeship system is overburdened by a dramatic expansion in the knowledge and skills needed for professional practice, (3) there is no standardized curriculum or accreditation process for educational programs, and (4) there is no educational program that incorporates formal clinical education. Based on this historical analysis, three major goals are proposed: (1) active entreprenurial promotion of professional educational programs by academics, (2) creation of a committee within the American Academy of Forensic Sciences to critique and rate university programs, and (3) the development of a well-defined clinical education program. A model for formalized clinical education in the forensic laboratory sciences is proposed, incorporating clinical professors, student clerkships, and university control over instruction within an operational forensic science laboratory. Benefits from this arrangement include: efficient combination of physical plants, added personnel resources in the laboratory, rapid introduction of research into the laboratory, enhanced prestige for both academics and practitioners, and relief of the laboratory's in-house training burden.\r"

  ".U": "89010829\r", 
  ".W": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized neuropathologically by the presence of neuritic plaques (NP) in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, as well as intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles and granulovacuolar degeneration. The etiology of plaque formation has remained obscure, but morphologically NP are known to contain amyloid cores surrounded by astrocytes and degenerating neurons. Although growth factors are important in growth, differentiation and regrowth in response to injury, studies relating growth factors to AD have been lacking. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role outside the central nervous system (CNS) through interaction with its specific receptor, EGF-R. Using an antibody to EGF-R (three-step immunoperoxidase staining) in conjunction with fluorescence staining, we found that the majority of NP from patients with pathologically confirmed AD as well as those few NP in the normal aging brain showed intense EGF-R immunoreactivity. Specific staining was seen at the periphery of plaques but not in the central amyloid core. Tissue sections from AD cases were also reacted with antibodies to both glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and paired helical filaments (PHF) in an attempt to identify which component of the NP was reactive for EGF-R. The antibody to PHF densely stained the periphery of NP but not the central core in a majority of NP. The antibody to GFAP stained a few reactive astrocytes that bordered plaques in only a small proportion of all plaques present. We conclude that the neuron and its processes although not exclusively may be the site of EGF-R immunoreactivity. An EGF/EGF-R system within the CNS may play an important part in scar formation in response to neuronal injury and death or it may function as a trophic factor important in axonal or dendritic sprouting. It is also possible that EGF could serve as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the CNS.\r"

Seven patients with clinically or pathologically confirmed paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and two neurologically normal patients with high titers of anticerebellar antibodies were studied. Sera from all antibody-positive patients, but not from controls, produced intense staining of brain sections. Sera from patients with ovarian adenocarcinoma reacted predominantly with Purkinje cells and neurons within brainstem nuclei. Sera from patients with oat cell carcinoma and one patient with ductal carcinoma of the breast produced nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of neurons throughout the central nervous system. Serum from a patient with Hodgkin's disease labeled the peripheries of Purkinje cells and Golgi II cells. Serum from a patient with mixed mesodermal sarcoma of the ovary labeled Purkinje cells, basket cells, and scattered astrocytes. Staining of extraneural tissues was not observed. This study confirms the presence of antineural antibodies in patients with systemic neoplasia with and without paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and suggests that the antigens recognized by this antibody response may vary with the associated neoplasm.\r"

Patients ranged from one day to 69 years with 12 cases under the age of two. LN-1-positive microglia were present in 22 brains. LN-1 did not stain any other glial or neuronal cells. Five negative brains included two irradiated gliomas, two cases of multiple sclerosis and one normal case. Immunostaining was confined to cells with bipolar processes and rod-shaped nuclei recapitulating the characteristic features of microglia in silver-impregnated sections. LN-1-positive microglia were most prominent in the grey matter and in the grey-white junction with fewer positive cells seen in the white matter. Double immunostaining with LN-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) clearly distinguished LN-1-positive microglia and GFAP-positive astrocytes. The expression of LN-1, a B-lymphocyte antigen, by microglia contradicts the macrophage derivation theory and supports data indicating a functional role of microglia in immune processes. LN-1, while not specific for microglia, should be considered a useful marker, more reliable than silver impregnation, for detecting microglia in paraffin section.\r"

  ".W": "From July 1980 to November 1985, 109 patients with acute myelogenous and lymphoblastic leukemia who had reached a complete remission (CR) following induction treatment were assigned to a study comparing marrow transplantation with chemotherapy as a postremission treatment. Sixty-nine patients did not have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor, and therefore served as chemotherapy controls; 40 patients had HLA-identical donors, and therefore were assigned to the transplant arm. Of these, 23 were transplanted in first remission and 17 were not. Ten of these 17 were subsequently transplanted in relapse. Initially, only patients with poor prognosis determined by a predictive model were entered into the study. Subsequently, patients with moderately poor prognosis were admitted. Comparing the chemotherapy group with the patients transplanted in first CR, significant control of leukemia relapse in transplanted patients was seen in the subgroup with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (P less than .1), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (P less than .01), in the poor (P = .01) and intermediate subgroup (P = .01), and in the good-prognostic groups (P = .05). The survival was affected significantly in only the poor and intermediate subgroups. The use of predictive models might help to select patients for whom bone marrow transplantation is appropriate in first remission and those for whom bone marrow transplantation can be left as the initial treatment of relapse. Predictive models could further be helpful in comparing studies performed at different transplant centers.\r"

In order to quantitate toxicity that was felt to be due to the preparative regimen (termed regimen-related toxicity [RRT]), a system was developed in which toxicities were graded from 0 (none) to 4 (fatal). One hundred ninety-five patients who underwent marrow transplantation for leukemia were studied retrospectively to determine whether toxicities that were clinically felt to be due to the preparative regimen were influenced by other factors such as disease status, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, and allogenicity. All patients developed grade I toxicity in at least one organ, and 30 developed grades III-IV (life-threatening or fatal) RRT. RRT was more common in relapsed patients v remission patients (P = .04), in those receiving 15.75 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) v 12.0 Gy TBI (P = .028), and in those receiving allogeneic marrow v autologous marrow (P = .0029). Autologous marrow recipients did not develop grades III-IV toxicity in this study. A multivariate analysis controlling for autologous marrow grafting showed that the dose of TBI was the only statistically significant predictor of grades III-IV RRT. Those patients who developed grade III RRT were unlikely to survive 100 days from transplant, though not all deaths could be attributed to RRT. Patients who developed grade II toxicity in three or more organs were more likely to die within 100 days than those developing grade II toxicity in two or less organs (P = .0027). This system was generally able to distinguish RRT from other toxicities observed in marrow recipients.\r"

Assessment included measurement of serum alpha fetoprotein (alpha FP) and beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta HCG) (tumor markers) and chest x-ray monthly for 1 year, then twice monthly for 1 year, with computed tomographic (CT) scans of abdomen and chest repeated three times monthly for the first year and six times monthly for the second year. Median follow-up was 36 months (range, 14 to 92 months). Relapse occurred in 12 patients (33.3%) at a median of 7 months (range, 2 to 28 months). Elevated markers were of limited importance in relapse detection, confirming the need for close clinical and radiological follow-up. Of nine histological factors examined in the primary tumor only the presence of lymphatic invasion was associated with a significantly higher relapse rate. All patients were treated at relapse with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Four underwent surgery in addition, two before and two after chemotherapy. Eleven were rendered disease-free, but four had a second relapse. One patient has died, one is alive with disease, and ten are disease-free. Chemotherapy failed to cure six patients who had relapsed but bulk of disease was not a factor. Despite the good overall result reported here, optimal postorchidectomy management of apparent stage I disease remains to be defined.\r"

Those sera found to be positive for presence of antibody by the EIA were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies (NA) by an antiviral neutralization bioassay (ANB). All patients were evaluable for toxicity, and 19 were evaluable for response and for incidence of antibody formation. Five patients (26%; 95% confidence interval, 6% to 46%) had complete responses (CR) or partial responses (PR) with a median duration of 283 days. An additional ten patients (53%) had minor tumor regressions with a median duration of 86 days. Fifty-one percent of evaluable patients are alive at 18.6 months. Antibodies to rIFN-alpha 2a as measured by the EIA, were detected in 12 (63%) patients. NA were measured in the serum of six (50%) of those EIA-positive patients. Overall, six of 19 patients (32%) developed NA. Median time to the development of antibody as measured by EIA or NA was 8 and 14 weeks, respectively. Median NA titer was 1,200 IFN neutralizing U/mL. NA-positive and -negative patients had a median duration of response of 13.7 v 9.9 months, and survival of greater than 21.3 v 18.3 months, respectively. Clinical toxicity was mild and not therapeutically limiting. Autoantibody production (ANA, rheumatoid factor [RF], Coombs' direct/indirect) occurred in both NA-positive and -negative patients. The clinical significance of the antibodies to rIFN-alpha 2a and the associated autoantibody formation remain unclear; however, presence of antibody was not associated with adverse clinical sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "Three hundred thirty-one women with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive combination chemotherapy with either cyclophosphamide, Novantrone (mitoxantrone; Lederle Laboratories, Wayne, NJ), and fluorouracil (CNF) or cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and fluorouracil (CAF). Patients could not have had prior chemotherapy, although adjuvant chemotherapy was acceptable. Initial doses were 500 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide and 500 mg/m2 of fluorouracil with either 10 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone or 50 mg/m2 of doxorubicin, administered intravenously (IV) on day 1 and repeated every 3 weeks. There were no statistically significant differences in pretreatment or prior therapy characteristics between the groups. For patients assigned to the CNF and CAF groups, respectively, 25 (18%) were premenopausal, 39 (40%) were estrogen receptor (ER) negative, 39 (38%) had a disease-free interval less than 1 year, and 24 (26%) had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients were compared for response rate, duration of response, time to progression or death, time to treatment failure (TTF), and survival. None of these parameters were statistically significant favoring one regimen over the other. The response rate (complete [CR] and partial response [PR]) was 29% for the CNF group (95% confidence interval of 22% to 37%) and 37% for the CAF group (95% confidence interval of 29% to 45%). The median response duration and TTF were 171 days and 125 days for the CNF group and 254 days and 147 days for the CAF group, respectively. The median survival times for the CNF group and the CAF group were 377 and 385 days, respectively. The major dose-limiting toxicity for both regimens was leukopenia, manifested as granulocytopenia. The incidence of stomatitis/mucositis was 10% in the CNF group and 19% in the CAF group. Alopecia occurred in 49% of CNF patients (severely for 4%) and in 86% of CAF patients (severely for 39%). Nausea/vomiting occurred in 80% of CNF patients and in 81% of CAF patients; the degree of severity was also comparable. There was significantly less cardiotoxicity observed in the CNF group compared with the CAF group. Although CNF is somewhat less effective in overall response rate, survival curves are identical. CNF can be offered to patients who reject anthracycline-containing regimens because of fear of alopecia.\r"

  ".W": "From 1968 to 1986, 192 patients from 0 to 17 years of age were enrolled in three consecutive protocol-controlled studies of Wilms' tumor at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. Tumors were completely excised at the time of diagnosis whenever possible, and patients were subsequently treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy according to the initial extent of disease. All patients received dactinomycin and vincristine, with doxorubicin added to the regimens in studies 2 and 3. Chemotherapy was extended to 18 months in study 2 (n = 53), but was limited to 12 months for most patients in study 3 (n = 107). In the third study, radiation was eliminated altogether for patients with stage I or II tumors and was reduced to 12 Gy for those with more advanced disease. Intensification of chemotherapy in study 2 improved the 5-year relapse-free survival rate over that in study 1 (82% v 52%), but the accompanying increase in toxicity was considered unacceptable. Comparison of 2-year relapse-free survival rates in studies 2 and 3 indicated that the reduction of therapy in the latter trial did not jeopardize disease control: 88% v 86% for patients with stage II or III disease, favorable histology; 75% v 57% for the same stages, unfavorable histology; and 57% v 61% for stage IV patients. At least 80% of all patients enrolled in study 3 will be long-term survivors. We conclude that rescheduling of effective antitumor drugs and eliminating or reducing radiotherapy are feasible alternatives in the treatment of Wilms' tumor with favorable histologic features.\r"

  ".W": "Fluorouracil (5FU) is still considered the most active antineoplastic agent in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. The drug needs to be converted to the nucleotide level in order to exert its effect. It can be incorporated into RNA leading to interference with the maturation of nuclear RNA. However, its conversion to 5-fluoro-2'deoxy-5' monophosphate (FdUMP) leading to inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS) and subsequently of DNA synthesis, is considered to be its main mechanism of action. In the presence of a folate cofactor a covalent ternary complex is formed, the stability of which is the main determinant of the action of 5FU. Resistance against 5FU can be mainly attributed to aberrations in its metabolism or to alterations of TS, eg, gene amplification, altered kinetics in respect to nucleotides or folates. Biochemical modulation of 5FU metabolism can be applied to overcome resistance against 5FU. A variety of normal purines, pyrimidines, and other antimetabolites have been studied in this respect, but only some of them have been clinically successful. Delayed administration of uridine has recently been shown to \"rescue\" mice and patients from toxicity, while pretreatment with leucovorin is the most promising combination to enhance the therapeutic efficacy. 5FU is frequently administered in an intravenous (IV) injection, and shows a rapid distribution and a triphasic elimination. The nonlinearity of 5FU pharmacokinetics is related to saturation of its degradation. Continuous infusion of 5FU led to different kinetics. Regional administration, such as hepatic artery infusion, offers a way to achieve higher drug concentrations in liver metastases and is accompanied by lower systemic concentration. The current status of the biochemical and pharmacokinetic data is reviewed.\r"

These preliminary results indicate potential usefulness of this method in the evaluation of renal function following transplant surgery.\r"

The heart, lungs, liver, brain, kidney, and blood were excised and counted in a well-counter to determine the amount of the injected material in each organ and blood. In order for the percent of total injected activity to be determined, a technique was developed which allowed discrimination of the 140 keV gamma-ray of 99mTc from sum peaks of 153Gd when the latter is counted in a well-counter with 4 pi geometry. Although the distribution of the two DTPA compounds was qualitatively similar, statistical analysis indicated that the amount of 99mTc deposited in the lungs was higher than 153Gd (p = 0.03), the amount of 99mTc deposited in the kidneys was lower than 153Gd (p = 0.0004) and the amount of 99mTc in the blood was higher than 153Gd (p = 0.0022). This may be due to the greater binding of [99mTc]DTPA or its minor impurities to plasma proteins.\r"

The patient presented with fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal arteries, which was shown by hippuran renography to be functionally significant on the right side. She became normotensive after angioplasty of the right renal artery. Hypertension recurred a year later, at which time the renogram was normal without captopril, but showed functionally significant left renal artery stenosis with captopril challenge. Both the conventional agent, [131I]hippuran, and an experimental new 99mTc-labeled hippuran analog, [99mTc]MAG3, were used. Angiography confirmed progression of disease on the left side, which was successfully treated by angioplasty. Functionally significant unilateral renal artery stenosis was thus demonstrated first on the right side and then, 1 yr later, on the left side, using hippuran and [99mTc]MAG3. Anatomic progression of disease was documented by angiography.\r"

  ".W": "Few data are available regarding the prevalence and causes of false-negative auscultation (mis-auscultation) of aortic (AR), mitral (MR), or tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and there are no such data that are relevant when the patient's pretest probability of having regurgitation is unknown. The authors therefore studied 294 patients examined by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. On 755 examinations (2.57 examinations per patient), Doppler velocity patterns typical of AR, MR, or TR were found in 63, 96, and 49 patients, respectively. For all three murmurs, mis-auscultation was the rule, rather than the exception, with sensitivities of auscultation ranging from 0 to 37%, depending (but weakly) on the site of the murmur and the years of training of the observer. Specificity of auscultation was high (85% to 100%). The factors associated with the mis-auscultation of AR were poor image quality in the echocardiograms, absence of cardiomegaly, and less experience of the examiner. The probability of missing MR increased in the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) or if the examiner had less experience. The likelihood of missing TR by auscultation was increased by CAD, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or the absence of cardiomegaly. This study suggests that there is a high prevalence of \"silent\" murmurs, and that not hearing a regurgitant murmur does not suffice to rule out the presence of regurgitation.\r"

The 89 articles were assessed against seven methodologic criteria, including use of a well-defined \"gold standard,\" clearly defined test interpretation, blinding, clear data presentation, correct use of sensitivity and specificity, calculation of predictive values, and consideration of prevalence. In comparisons of 1985 vs. 1982 articles, there were significant improvements in five of the seven criteria. For example, the proportion of articles using a well-defined \"gold standard\" rose from 68% to 88%. Overall, the frequency of papers demonstrating five or more of the seven criteria increased from 26% to 47%. However, predictive values were discussed in only 54% of the articles without, necessarily, consideration of the influence of prevalence as well. This study raises the concern that while the concepts of sensitivity and specificity are now accepted, predictive values remain less well understood. Although there has been an improvement in the assessment of diagnostic tests in published research, attention to accepted methodologic standards is still needed on the part of researchers, reviewers, and editors.\r"

The authors developed an intervention designed to increase the involvement of patients in medical decision making. In a 20-minute session just before the regular visit to a physician, a clinic assistant reviewed the medical record of each experimental patient with him/her, guided by a diabetes algorithm. Using systematic prompts, the assistant encouraged patients to use the information gained to negotiate medical decisions with the doctor. A randomized trial was conducted in two university hospital clinics to compare this intervention with standard educational materials in sessions of equal length. The mean pre-intervention glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) values were 10.6 +/- 2.1% for 33 experimental patients and 10.3 +/- 2.0% for 26 controls. After the intervention the mean levels were 9.1 +/- 1.9% in the experimental group (p less than 0.01) and 10.6 +/- 2.22% for controls. Analysis of audiotapes of the visits to the physician showed the experimental patients were twice as effective as controls in eliciting information from the physician. Experimental patients reported significantly fewer function limitations. The authors conclude that the intervention is feasible and that it changes patient behavior, improves blood sugar control, and decreases functional limitations.\r"

Mean ridge height was 15.3 mm before surgery and 19.5 mm after 12 months, an augmentation of 4.2 mm. Predictable compaction occurred largely in the first few months after denture loading. Most patients, surgeons, and prosthodontists assessed the results of the procedure as good to excellent at 1 year following implantation. Adverse experiences, largely dehiscence and paresthesia, tended to resolve over time. Sera from ten patients demonstrated antibodies to bovine collagen that were not clinically significant. Alveolar augmentation with collagen/hydroxylapatite achieved clinically significant results that compared favorably with those achieved with other types of ceramic implants.\r"

The tissue expanders allow the development of a flap that has the same color and texture as the lost tissue. It also precludes the need of a distantly developed flap with its associated morbidity. The highly vascular fibrous capsule developed around the expander provides the advantage of initially greater blood supply and increased bulk for coverage of a bone graft. Although this is temporary in nature, it provides a desirable receptor bed during the critical period of bony union. The ready availability of adjacent tissue, the esthetic considerations, and the comparative reduction in morbidity when compared with use of distant flaps makes the use of tissue expanders an attractive technique in maxillofacial reconstruction.\r"

Forty-eight children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia were randomized to receive suspensions of either sucralfate or placebo orally every 6 hours during the first 10 weeks of intensive remission-induction chemotherapy. Patients given sucralfate suspension were less likely than subjects receiving placebo to acquire colonization with potentially pathogenic microorganisms: 14 (58%) of 24 versus 22 (92%) of 24, respectively (p = 0.008). However, no effect on preexisting colonization was noted. Subjective reporting of discomfort, objective scoring of the severity of mucositis, and the maximal percent of body weight lost during therapy were similar; 58% of patients receiving sucralfate reported no oral pain compared with 25% receiving placebo (p = 0.06). Ten episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, 25 documented infections, and 886 days with fever were also equally distributed between sucralfate and placebo groups. We conclude that sucralfate suspension is of limited, if any efficacy, in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. Sucralfate administration can, however, reduce acquisition of alimentary colonization with potential pathogens, perhaps by interfering with adherence to mucosal membranes.\r"

Before therapy the median basal cortisol concentration in all infants was 8.2 micrograms/dl (226 nmol/L). After stimulation with 1-24 ACTH, the serum cortisol concentration rose in all infants to a median concentration of 23.5 micrograms/dl (649 nmol/L), resulting in a median rise of 13.4 micrograms/dl (37 nmol/L). Immediately after 7 days of glucocorticoid therapy basal and peak cortisol concentrations were significantly decreased in the dexamethasone group. The rise in serum cortisol following 1-24 ACTH, however, remained equivalent in both groups. Ten days after the end of therapy basal and peak cortisol concentrations in the dexamethasone group had returned to levels equivalent to those seen in the placebo group. Weight gain was markedly diminished while the infants were receiving dexamethasone. Weight gains were, however, equivalent 10 days after the end of treatment. These data indicate that 7 days of dexamethasone therapy has significant but short-term effects on cortisol secretion and possibly on weight gain.\r"

Approximately 85-90% of the hydrolysis of [leu]enkephalin is attributed to the combined action of aminopeptidase M and angiotensin converting enzyme, whereas \"enkephalinase\" and aminopeptidase MII activity against [leu]enkephalin are not detectable. Similarly, 80-90% of the hydrolysis of D-ala2-[L-leu] enkephalin (DALLE) is due to the combined action of aminopeptidase M and angiotensin converting enzyme, whereas aminopeptidase MII and enkephalinase activity against this substrate also could not be detected. This is in contrast to the high susceptibility to hydrolysis by enkephalinase, and the low susceptibility to aminopeptidase activity, for DALLE in brain tissue. Among other alternatives, it is suggested that enkephalin hydrolysis in plasma may appear to be unique because of differences in enzyme conformation and/or the availability of a substance(s) that competes with, or alters the binding of, [leu] enkephalin, DALLE or the inhibitors to the enzymes.\r"

  ".U": "89011454\r", 
  ".W": "In rats with a unilateral lesion of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, the ipsilateral rotation produced by the enhanced actions of endogenous dopamine (DA) on the nonlesioned side, induced by either the DA-releasing drug amphetamine or the DA uptake inhibitor GBR 13069, was blocked effectively by pretreatment with either the selective D1 DA receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, or the D2 selective antagonist, haloperidol. In contrast, contralateral rotation produced by apomorphine or I-dihydroxyphenylalanine, which lead to the preferential activation of D1 and D2 receptors on the lesioned side, was effectively prevented only when both receptor subtypes were inhibited. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the interaction between D1 and D2 receptors in the lesioned side differs from that in the nonlesioned side. Whereas the simultaneous stimulation of both DA receptor subtypes in the normally innervated basal ganglia is required for the production of turning behavior, the stimulation of either subtype alone in the dopaminergic denervated side can produce rotation. However, the concurrent administration of the D1 agonist, SKF 38393, with the D2 agonist, LY 171555, produced a synergistic effect on contralateral rotation. These results suggest that there is preservation of at least some functional interaction between D1 and D2 receptors in the lesioned basal ganglia but that there may be in addition a mechanism by which the two receptor subtypes can function independently of each other. The unilaterally lesioned rat appears to be a very good model in which to study the interaction between D1 and D2 receptors under conditions of both normal innervation and of DA denervation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The antihypertensive effects of SK&F 102698 (50 mg/kg p.o.) were studied in three different rat models of hypertension. In spontaneously hypertensive and deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rats SK&F 102698 produced blood pressure reductions of approximately 21 and 23%, respectively. In contrast, SK&F 102698 did not produce a significant decrease in blood pressure in 2-kidney, 1-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats. The antihypertensive mechanism of action of dopamine beta-hydroxylase inhibition was probed with the selective DA1-receptor antagonist SCH 23390, which produced an attenuation of the antihypertensive effects of SK&F 102698. Experiments were designed to separate the peripheral from the central components of the cardiovascular effects of SK&F 102698. In spinal cord stimulated pithed spontaneously hypertensive rats, SK&F 102698 reduced blood pressure but not heart rate, indicating a peripherally mediated vasodilation and a centrally mediated heart rate effect. Furthermore, when SK&F 102698 was administered directly into the fourth ventricle of conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, a pronounced bradycardia and lowering of blood pressure was observed. SCH 23390 (200 micrograms/kg i.v.) and l-sulpiride (1 mg/kg i.v.) inhibited the cardiovascular effects of SK&F 102698 administered into the fourth ventricle. These data indicate that inhibition of dopamine beta-hydroxylase with SK&F 102698 results in both peripherally and centrally mediated cardiovascular effects and suggest that central dopamine receptors contribute to the control of systemic blood pressure in hypertensive models associated with an increased sympathetic outflow.\r"

The selectivity of the binding of [3H]SCH 23390 was characterized further in studies using homogenates of canine choroid plexus. Scatchard analysis of the binding of increasing concentrations of [3H]SCH 23390 resulted in a curvilinear plot when (+)-butaclamol was used to define specific binding. Nonlinear regression analysis of untransformed data was consistent with the presence of two distinct classes of binding sites. The high-affinity site (Kd, 0.4 nM) was present at low density (maximum binding sites, 30 fmol/mg of protein) and had the pharmacological properties expected of a D-1 receptor. The low-affinity site (Kd, 24 nM) was present at a much greater density (maximum binding sites, 350 fmol/mg of protein) and had the pharmacological properties expected of a 5-hydroxytryptamine1c receptor. Quantitative autoradiographic studies of the binding of [3H]SCH 23390 to sections of rat brain also suggested that 5-hydroxytroptamine1c receptors in the choroid plexus are labeled by [3H]SCH 23390. It is possible that [3H]SCH 23390 labels 5-hydroxytryptamine1c receptors in other brain regions as well.\r"

  ".W": "One of many important roles of the naturally occurring nonapeptide bradykinin (BK) is the modulation of vascular tone. As endothelial cells may play vital roles in the physiology of vascular tissues, it is important to understand the interaction of this peptide with endothelial cells. By using radiolabeled BK we have demonstrated for the first time BK specific binding sites in membranes of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. There are two types of receptors shown in binding assay: one with a saturable, high-affinity binding (Kd = 1.28 +/- 0.21 nM, maximum binding = 111.4 +/- 12.0 fmol/mg) and the other with not readily saturable, low-affinity binding. The activation of BK receptors on bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells is assessed by two functional assays, namely, the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor and the elevation of cytosolic calcium. The characteristics of the BK receptors in both binding and functional assays indicate that the high-affinity binding is to B2 receptors and the low-affinity binding is to B1 receptors on the cells. Thus, high-affinity binding is blocked by B2 antagonists, D-Arg[Hyp3, thienylalanine5,8,D-Phe7]-BK and [thienylalanine5,8, D-Phe7]-BK and low-affinity binding is blocked by B1 antagonist des-Arg9[Leu8]-BK. The elevation of intracellular calcium and the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor in response to BK in endothelial cells is predominately through B2 receptor activation. The ability to subtype BK receptors in endothelial cells may facilitate the understanding of the vascular functions of BK and the potential design of drugs to regulate these functions.\r"

However, little is known about the specific performance characteristics and limitations of this technique with respect to volume measurements. We performed and prospectively interpreted serial ultrasound examinations on myoma patients and confirmed the location, size and number of myomas in the surgical specimens. The smallest detectable tumor was 2.7 cm in diameter. The specificity was 94%; reproducibility had a 14% coefficient of variation for tumors with diameters greater than 6 cm. We conclude that ultrasound is suitable for imaging and sizing myomas provided that the diagnosis is otherwise certain and the tumors tracked are large.\r"

Sixteen days after suture placement the smallest tissue reaction was seen with 9-0 and 10-0 suture materials; Dexon-S caused a slightly greater reaction than did Vicryl. Prolene, 8-0 and 9-0, produced the smallest tissue response when compared to other sutures of similar size. Larger sutures incited greater tissue reactions. Forty-two days after placement, each suture was associated with similar or lower reaction scores than those observed at 16 days. At 90 days all the Dexon-S sutures had been absorbed. Vicryl had less of a late reaction as compared to the other sutures. Reactions persisted longer with nonabsorbable suture, and the tissue response depended on both the suture material and caliber. Vicryl, 8-0 to 10-0, incited the smallest short- and long-term tissue reaction; at those sizes it seems optimal for reconstructive tubal surgery.\r"

The premenstrual syndrome (PMS) group was composed of nine patients complaining of dizziness, irritability and depression close to menses for at least three years. The menstrually related migraine (MM) group was composed of 15 patients complaining of premenstrually related migraine. The common migraine (CM) group was made up of 16 women suffering from common migraine for years whose attacks occurred independently of menstrual cycle events. A group of seven fertile women served as controls. Every two days the patients filled out the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire for evaluation of their complaints. After the evaluation of spontaneous LH pulsatility for one hour, 4 mg of naloxone was injected as a bolus, and samples were collected every 15 minutes for 2 hours. Both estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) were measured in basal samples from each naloxone test. LH responsiveness to LHRH was similar in the mid and late luteal phases and did not change between groups. In the mid luteal phase the LH response to naloxone in PMS and MM patients was similar to that in normal subjects, while CM patients had impaired LH secretion. In the premenstrual phase only the controls maintained an LH responsiveness similar to that observed in the mid luteal phase, while both PMS and MM lost the naloxone-induced LH release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No characteristic finding in the past history, symptoms or physical examination combined sufficient sensitivity and specificity to serve by itself as a basis for selective testing for C trachomatis.

Evaluation of the physical findings on initial and follow-up visits of such patients during various treatment protocols has revealed distinct subsets of vulvodynia. In one series of 52 patients at the Emory Clinic, the following subsets were identified in decreasing order of frequency: (1) vulvar dermatoses, (2) cyclic candidiasis, (3) squamous papillomatosis, (4) vulvar vestibulitis, and (5) essential vulvodynia. These subsets may occur alone, simultaneously or sequentially; treatment for one condition may affect the onset of another. Vulvodynia may have multiple causes; use of the term for a patient's problem should prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation. Although the subsets are not entirely exclusive of one another, each is identified by an improvement with specific therapeutic modalities. The recognition of multiple factors in vulvodynia is important to appropriate patient evaluation and management.\r"

The ratio of the maximum (systole [S]) and minimum (diastole [D]) velocities appeared to reflect downstream vascular resistance. An S:D ratio of greater than or equal to 3.0 indicated elevation. There was a statistically higher S:D ratio in the placenta previa group as compared to the control group, and that difference persisted even when growth-retarded fetuses were excluded from both groups. Placenta previa patients with S:D ratios greater than or equal to 3.0 were associated with a statistically higher incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of an elevated S:D ratio in predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes were 90.0%, 93.8%, 62.0% and 98.5%, respectively. Our data suggest that (1) placenta previa patients are at increased risk of intrauterine growth retardation and adverse pregnancy outcomes, (2) placenta previa patients with normal S:D ratios are at no greater risk of adverse outcomes than are controls, (3) when the S:D ratio is elevated in placenta previa patients, it is more likely to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and (4) placenta previa patients without growth failure have a higher S:D ratio than do those with normally implanted placentas. Umbilical artery velocimetry appears to be a useful adjunct to ultrasound in the surveillance of pregnancies complicated by placenta previa.\r"

Since the source(s) of SF PLA2 has not been identified, we tested PLA2 content in SF cells obtained from 11 SF. Cell sonicates were prepared at 5 X 10(6) cells/ml. In the supernatants of the sonicated SF cells (n = 11), PLA2 activity ranged from 38-755 U/ml, mean 368 +/- 243 (SD) U/ml, compared to 5-64 U/ml, mean 31 +/- 15 (SD) U/ml in sonicates of normal peripheral blood PMN (n = 5) (p less than 0.0001). Spontaneous release of PLA2 from unstimulated SF cells ranged from 26-365 U/ml, mean 131 +/- 144 (SD) U/ml (n = 5), whereas spontaneous release from peripheral blood PMN was negligible. Neither 10(-8) M FMLP nor 5 X 10(-6) M dexamethasone altered extracellular PLA2 release. To assess whether PLA2 adsorbs passively to cell membranes through hydrophobic interaction, normal peripheral PMN were incubated in crude SF (n = 7) with PLA2 ranging from 4,000-24,300 U/ml, or with purified human SF PLA2 or Naja naja PLA2. We found that soluble PLA2 adsorbed to PMN membranes in a concentration dependent fashion. PLA2 activity in sonicates of PMN incubated in crude SF ranged from 185-358 U/ml compared to controls of 21-64 U/ml. Sonicates of PMN incubated with purified human SF PLA2 (5,000-30,000 U/ml) showed progressive concentration dependent increase in PLA2 from 7 +/- 4 to 212 +/- 11 (SD) U/ml (p less than 0.001).

These individuals were receiving weekly intramuscular methotrexate (MTX) but were about to discontinue because of side effects. While there was considerable improvement in nausea during the study, the effect of folinic acid could not be differentiated from that of placebo. There was no adverse effect on control of disease activity. It therefore seems likely that polyglutamated tissue stores of MTX do not contribute to drug efficacy and in this format folinic acid could not be shown to be more useful than placebo in reducing drug induced nausea.\r"

Papular lesions demonstrated fewer florid dermal and epidermal changes but a similar marked mononuclear cell infiltrate which in all groups was composed predominantly of T lymphocytes (68.4 +2- 11.2 SD) with the mean helper: suppressor (corrected Leu 3a:T8) ratio 1.73 +/- 0.60 SD.

The addition of 1 mM 4 aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) or 0.2 U/ml plasminogen increased proteoglycan release to 85%. Similar results were obtained when recombinant human interleukin-1 (IL-1) was used instead of MCM. Further, supernatant from MCM stimulated chondrocytes, incubated with dead cartilage explants for 3 days, did not significantly increase proteoglycan release above the background level of cartilage alone (7-10%), nor did the addition of 5 X 10(4) PEC to cultures of dead cartilage explants plus supernatant from MCM stimulated chondrocytes make any significant difference, indicating that supernatant from MCM stimulated chondrocytes and PEC alone had negligible cartilage proteoglycan degrading activity in these experiments. The inclusion of 0.1 mM APMA or 0.2 U/ml plasminogen in cultures of dead cartilage explants plus supernatant from MCM stimulated chondrocytes, however, increased proteoglycan release to 80-93%, with or without PEC. Our results suggest that plasminogen, activated by a product from IL-1 stimulated chondrocytes, greatly enhanced IL-1 mediated cartilage degradation by activating latent metalloproteinases.\r"

In this paper, the author reviews 25 methodologically-sound studies in order to define the efficacy and limitations of video. Video is as good as and often more effective than traditional methods of patient education in increasing short-term knowledge. It offers no advantage, however, in improving long-term retention of knowledge or in promoting compliance with medical regimens. A strength of video is role-modeling. When applied to well-defined, self-limited stressful situations, role-modeling in video decreases patients' anxiety, pain, and sympathetic arousal while increasing knowledge, cooperation, and coping ability. These effects may carry over for patients to less structured but similarly stressful situations.\r"

They used a ranking system based on human exposure and rodent potency (HERP) data to arrive at this conclusion. As a result, they recommend that regulatory agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration, base their priorities in this area on their HERP system. We analyzed the assumptions and data set upon which the HERPs were based, concluding that such a simplified approach to set public health policy is inappropriate given the underlying uncertainties. However, we note that when comparisons are consistently based on estimates of average daily exposure to common carcinogens, the HERP scores of many man-made pollutants are comparable to those of naturally occurring carcinogens in the diet.\r"

Nonetheless, relevant issues still remain to be addressed in regard to the optimal therapy for patients with germ cell neoplasms. Included in these issues is delineating the most effective but minimally morbid treatment for patients with early-stage and low-volume metastatic disease while continuing to create innovative treatment approaches for poor-risk patients with metastatic disease. The unique association of primary mediastinal germ cell neoplasms with the development of non-germ cell cancers and Klinefelter's syndrome may provide some early clues for the determination of factors controlling differentiation. These observations issue a challenge to both clinical and preclinical researchers involved in the study of this neoplasm.\r"

In a canine model of hyperdynamic sepsis (hemodynamically similar to human sepsis) changes in EVLW and in concentrations of different fatty acids in the aortic and pulmonary arterial blood were measured. Two days after induction of sepsis, EVLW increased from 6.6 +/- 0.6 to 9.2 +/- 1.0 ml/kg, and the pulmonary arterial concentration of oleic acid increased from 52 +/- 4 to 73 +/- 5 mg/dl. Three days after induction of sepsis, EVLW increased further to 14.4 +/- 3.8 ml/kg and the mean concentration of oleic acid increased to 74 +/- 7 mg/dl. Twenty-four hours later, both EVLW and the mean pulmonary arterial concentration of oleic acid were not different from basal. We postulate that oleic acid, a known inducer of experimental ARDS, is one of the mediators of endothelial damage of the lung during sepsis.\r"

The inhibitory responses were attributed to the intact phosphocitrate molecule as administration of citrate in equimolar concentrations did not mimic the observed effects of phosphocitrate. In comparison with non-infected controls, antibiotic treatment alone failed to eliminate total stone growth. However, composition of the stone reverted from predominantly struvite to a mixture of struvite and newberyite as urinary parameters normalized. The studies highlight the usefulness of phosphocitrate to restrict magnesium salt deposition in vivo.\r"

Thirteen of 40 patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia had 18 cardiovascular procedures done to save life or limb. Greenfield filters were placed in eight patients to prevent pulmonary embolism. Eight patients had 10 arterial procedures, with alternative anticoagulation that used dextran or warfarin in five cases. In three cases iloprost, a derivative of prostacyclin and a potent platelet inhibitor, was infused intraoperatively and heparin was given. Both the use of alternative anticoagulants and platelet suppression by iloprost were clinically effective strategies. The concurrent measurement of plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin and fibrinopeptide A in two patients confirmed that both approaches can successfully prevent activation of platelets and plasma coagulation during arterial surgery. One operative death occurred; all vascular reconstructions remained patent at 3 to 6 months. In two patients who received heparin alone for arterial surgery, both procedures resulted in thrombosis and limb loss. When major venous thromboembolism is complicated by heparin-associated thrombocytopenia, insertion of a Greenfield vena cava filter should be considered if there is significant risk of pulmonary embolism. When necessary, arterial surgery is feasible in patients with heparin-associated thrombocytopenia if alternative anticoagulation or adequate suppression of platelet reactivity can be achieved.\r"

The challenge of treating both the pregnant woman and the fetus was managed successfully by an emergent cesarean section followed by Dacron graft replacement of the descending thoracic aorta. The literature reviewed disclosed that aneurysm expansion producing symptoms and dissection is most common during the third trimester and during labor and delivery in patients with or without Marfan's syndrome. Half of the aortic dissections in women less than 40 years of age occur in association with pregnancy. The available evidence indicates that patients with known valvular or aortic disease should have surgical repairs during the first or second trimester and thereafter have delivery by cesarean section. However, patients with acute aortic problems near term appear to be better managed by cesarean section followed promptly by treatment of the aortic disease.\r"

This article describes a case of multiple tibial artery pseudoaneurysms that appeared 4 years after embolectomy in a 42-year-old man with otherwise normal arteries. The patient was treated by internal aneurysmorrhaphy without sequelae. A literature review of balloon catheter injuries yielded 46 cases categorized as arterial disruption (29), intimal injury (12), or catheter malfunction (5). These resulted in hemorrhage (13 cases), arteriovenous fistula (12), pseudoaneurysm (four), thrombosis (three), dissection (five), accelerated atherosclerosis (four), and catheter fragment embolism (five). Of these complications, only 41% were recognized during the initial operation. Direct observation detected 32% of these, whereas 68% were shown only by completion arteriography. Complications recognized during initial operation were more frequently asymptomatic without further surgery (84%) than those detected postoperatively (30%, p less than 0.001). Completion arteriography detected 87% of balloon catheter complications compared with only 23% of complications recognized intraoperatively without arteriography (p less than 0.001). We conclude that delicate technique, completion arteriography, prompt surgical treatment, and extended follow-up are important components of balloon catheter embolectomy.\r"

In our recent experience, 10 patients sustained 18 blunt cervical arterial injuries: two internal carotid artery (ICA) dissections, three ICA transections with pseudoaneurysm, five ICA thromboses, two vertebral artery dissections, one vertebral artery transection with pseudoaneurysm, one vertebral artery thrombosis, one minimal vertebral artery injury, and three caroticocavernous fistulas. A delay of more than 12 hours in making the diagnosis occurred in seven of the 10 patients. The mental status was initially normal in seven patients. The subsequent development of focal neurologic findings incongruent with CT scanning of the head prompted four-vessel angiography. Treatment was individualized and included supportive management, intravenous heparin, ligation, extracranial-intracranial bypass, and radiologic embolization. We have developed an angiographic classification that may aid management. Early angiography in patients with neurologic findings incongruent with head CT scan or in whom a normal sensorium and hemiparesis are present may permit improved outcomes. We advocate direct operative repair for accessible lesions of recent onset. For surgically inaccessible lesions, those with delayed presentation or in some cases with a fixed neurologic deficit, intravenous heparin can be started and follow-up angiography, head CT scanning, and the patient's clinical status determine further therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) formation by whole-tissue segments of nine carotid endarterectomy specimens (CES), five normal aortic specimens (NAS), six saphenous vein specimens (SVS), and four platelet samples were determined by incubation with 10 mumol/L 1-14C-radiolabeled prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2), and in other experiments with and without 10 mumol/L of CGS 13080, a TxA2 synthase inhibitor. PGI2 formation (expressed as picomoles 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/2-min incubation per sample) by nonatheromatous proximal intima of CES (307 +/- 23, mean +/- standard error) and distal intima of CES (260 +/- 22) was not statistically different; however, it was greater than atheromatous transitional plaque (159 +/- 13 pmol) (p less than 0.01) and ulceration regions (140 +/- 15 pmol) (p less than 0.01) of CES, NAS (204 +/- 16 pmol) (p less than 0.01), and SVS (165 +/- 9 pmol) (p less than 0.01). TxA2 formation (expressed as picomoles TxB2/2-min incubation per sample) by CES ulceration (51 +/- 2 pmol) was low but greater than proximal (17 +/- 2 pmol) (p less than 0.01), distal (19 +/- 3 pmol) (p less than 0.01), and transitional (23 +/- 3 pmol) (p less than 0.01) regions. TxA2 formation by NAS and SVS was not detected (less than 10 pmol). CGS 13080 inhibited TxA2 formation by CES below the limits of detection. Incubation of 1.9 x 10(5) intact platelets with 10 mumol/L of PGH2 formed a quantity of TxA2 equal to that of CES ulceration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
