After participation in the project for 12 months, 138 members of the E group and 126 members of the C group were reinterviewed. The E group received more services, cost more to maintain, and were admitted to mental hospitals more often, but concomitant improvement in quality of life indicators was not evident. Alternative explanations for the findings are discussed.\r"

However, proportions of highly complex and non-elective procedures performed on the elderly were similar in counties with high and low surgical rates. A multiple regression model consisting of independent dimensions of county demographic and medical resources characteristics plus a proxy variable for surgical practice styles was applied to hospital and surgery rates. Variations in elderly surgical discharge rates were found to be related to the supply of medical resources and to surgical practice styles.\r"

Empirical analysis in one service area of the Indian Health Service (IHS) in Oklahoma reveals Indians of lower blood quantum to be younger, lower utilizers of expensive medical services, especially hospitals. The sudden loss of health care benefits from IHS will be detrimental not only to this population and to an ever increasing number of Indians in the future but also to the local service units in the Indian Health Service.\r"

However, the percentage of light smokers was considerably higher among Mexican Americans than among other groups.

However, there was evidence that the smoking behavior of younger Mexican Americans, particularly the women, was associated with the smoking behavior of their parents.\r"

Total influenza-associated excess mortality in six epidemics from the winters of 1972/73 to 1980/81 was about 200,000. About 80-90 per cent of excess mortality occurred in persons over 64 years old.\r"

  ".W": "The biomechanics of the biceps femoris tendon transfer were determined from four fresh, frozen extremities. All transfers involved the proximal and anterior advancement of a selected portion of the tendon to a position superficial to the lateral collateral ligament. The rotational torque and flexion force were measured before and after the transfer with the knee positioned at 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees, and 45 degrees of flexion, in neutral and 5 degrees internal rotation. Although more specimens need to be tested for statistical confirmation, the transfer of the superficial portion of the biceps tendon resulted in average decreases of 2% and 15% in the rotational and flexion capacity of the biceps, respectively. Biomechanically, the functional lever arm of the transferred tendon about the longitudinal (internal-external rotation) axis was essentially unchanged, while the functional lever arm about the sagittal (flexion-extension) axis was decreased slightly. The total transfer of the biceps tendon resulted in an increase of 28% in the rotational capacity, while the flexion capability was decreased an average of 75%. In addition, the total transfer resulted in the biceps becoming an extensor at 10 degrees and 20 degrees of flexion, which could actually worsen the instability. Thus, following the total transfer, the functional level arm about the sagittal axis was decreased, while the functional lever arm about the longitudinal axis was increased. In summary, neither the partial nor the total transfer of the biceps femoris tendon superficial and anterior to the fibular collateral ligament appeared to be a biomechanically effective ancillary for the treatment of anterolateral rotatory instability.\r"

  ".W": "We report on the number of knee injuries sustained by a major college football team during 2 full years when all players were required to wear laterally placed prophylactic knee braces during all practice sessions and all games. We found that the incidence rates of knee injuries were higher when the braces were worn compared to a similar period when the braces were not worn. There was also an increased number of ACL injuries during the brace period. Several indices characterizing the nature of the injuries were analyzed and were found not to be altered significantly when the prophylactic braces were used. These facts lead us to question the efficacy of prophylactic knee braces in preventing knee injuries in college football. The use of the braces was associated with increased episodes of muscle cramping in the triceps surae muscle group, required the constant attention of coaches and trainers to remind the players to wear the braces and to apply them correctly, and was costly. These findings indicate the need for other carefully controlled clinical and biomechanical studies of these devices before their routine use can be advocated.\r"

The subjects were evaluated preoperatively by a questionnaire and clinical examination, both of which were repeated at followup. The efficacy of the postsurgical rehabilitation was monitored with measurement of quadriceps and hamstring strength on the Cybex Dynamometer. All of the patients had a KT-1000 knee ligament arthrometer test at followup that was compared with the clinical examination. Sixty-five percent of the subjects (13 of 20) with a Lachman and pivot shift of +1 returned to their previous activity level without limitation. Of the patients with a KT-1000 compliance index of 1 mm, 70% (11 of 17) returned to the same athletic level. However, only 20% (2 of 11) of the patients with a clinical instability greater than +1 or a compliance index of 2 mm were able to perform without limitation. The location of the meniscal tear did not correlate with the functional outcome. Six patients required ACL reconstruction.\r"

The analysis included four standardized knee scoring scales for subjective, objective, functional, and radiological evaluations, as well as isokinetic and isometric strength measurements. In the great majority of the patients (86%) the long-term results were excellent or good. The main reason for failure was ACL insufficiency, an obvious outcome of overlooked rupture of that ligament in the primary situation. If the injured knee is indeed stable, if there is no suspicion of ACL injury or patella luxation in the patient's history or clinical findings, and if routine radiographs are negative, primary arthroscopy is not needed. However, a close followup with repeated clinical examinations and a well-planned rehabilitation program is obligatory.\r"

The application of these forces abducted the humerus to approximately 90 degrees. The cocking phase of throwing was then simulated through the use of an Instron. With random variation of the rotator cuff forces, we investigated the effects that each force had on the rotation of the humerus and the strain of the inferior glenohumeral ligament. Our results demonstrate that the infraspinatus/teres minor muscle group was the most effective in controlling external rotation of the humerus and in reducing ligamentous strain. These observations are pertinent in the treatment of anterior instability syndromes of the shoulder.\r"

These races may involve from 30 minutes to 36 hours of continuous exercise, usually in warm or hot environments. Little has been published regarding the medical and physiological aspects of these events. This paper represents the first large study to date on the subject, including both an analysis of medical complications at six triathlons as well as a prospective electrolyte study conducted at two of these races. Medical records were kept and examined for all athletes requiring treatment during a typical United States Triathlon Series (USTS) race in 1986 (1,000 starters; finish times, 2 to 4 hours), a typical Ironman Qualifier (IQ) race in 1986 (622 starters; finish times, 4 to 8 hours), and the 1982 through 1985 Hawaii Ironman World Championships (4,583 starters; finish times, 9 to 17 hours). At the USTS race, fewer than 2% (17/1,000) of the starters required aid, at the IQ, approximately 10% (61/622) of the starters were treated, and at the Ironman, an average of 17% (794/4,583) received medical attention. The most common diagnoses at the USTS and IQ were dehydration and heat exhaustion. At the Ironman, dehydration and heat problems were complicated by hyponatremia. Because hyponatremia has been reported as a complication of ultraendurance events, a prospective study was performed on 36 athletes during a USTS race and 64 athletes at the 1984 Ironman race. Prerace and postrace blood samples showed that no athletes were hyponatremic following the shorter USTS race, but 27% (17/64) of the athletes studied were hyponatremic following the Ironman race.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In marathon runners there was a significant correlation between the injury rate during any 1 month and the distance covered during the preceding month (r = 0.59). In a retrospective analysis of the cause of injury, a training error alone or in combination with other factors was the most common injury-provoking factor (72%). The injury pattern varied among the three groups of runners: hamstring strain and tendinitis were most common in sprinters, backache and hip problems were most common in middle-distance runners, and foot problems were most common in marathon runners.\r"

The three methods of visualizing amastigotes in tissue samples (histological staining of tissue sections, impression smears of punch biopsies, and smears of dermal scraping from slits in the lesion margins) were less sensitive than the four Leishmania isolation methods (aspiration of lesion border cultured in biphasic media, aspirate inoculated into hamster nasal tissue, culture of punch biopsy macerate, and hamster inoculation of macerate). The aspirate-culture and biopsy-hamster methods employed in this study proved most sensitive of the four methods for the recovery of parasites. The combined overall sensitivity of the 7 methods was 67% for all enrolled patients and 75% for Montenegro skin test-positive patients. The individual sensitivities for the methods for all patients and Montenegro-positive positive, patients, respectively, were: histopathology 14% and 16%, impression smear 19% and 21%, dermal scraping 22% and 26%, aspirate-culture 58% and 64%, aspirate-hamster 38% and 41%, biopsy-culture 50% and 55%, and biopsy-hamster 52% and 57%. All methods were less sensitive in lesions of greater than 6 months duration than in lesions of more recent onset. Mucosal lesions were best diagnosed by the culture or hamster inoculation of a macerated mucosal biopsy. The diagnosis by inoculation of hamsters was achieved within 2 to 12 weeks, a mean of 34.5 days. Promastigotes were seen on Senekjie's medium within 3-8 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compared to the controls, the contribution of serum components to suppression in presence of any of the mitogens and antigens was not significant. The same applied to adherent cells, except in the presence of leishmania antigen where adherent cells contributed significantly (P less than 0.001). Removal of adherent cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients and controls considerably increased in vitro lymphocyte responses to both mitogens and antigens (by about twice), suggesting that in this study, the inhibition of in vitro lymphocyte responses to antigens and mitogens by adherent cells was a general phenomenon independent of the presence of the disease.\r"

A cloned, monomorphic, slow growing, and relatively avirulent line of T. b. gambiense was serially passaged at 3- to 5-day intervals through immunosuppressed mice. The growth rate measured within the first 2 patent days of infection did not vary significantly through the first 25 passages but by passage 50 had decreased significantly from 11.9 +/- 1.1 hr to 9.0 +/- 0.7 hr. A clone from passage 50 and three different second peak heterologous variants all had statistically similar growth rates, indicating that the rate of proliferation was a stable trait. With the faster rate of proliferation there was a corresponding increase in virulence. The inoculum necessary to kill 50% of normal outbred mice in the first peak of parasitemia (LD50) dropped significantly from 3 X 10(6) first passage parasites to 4 X 10(5) passage 50 parasites. The lethal load for both fast and slow growing organisms was the same (greater than 2 X 10(9) trypanosomes/ml of blood). To further link virulence and growth rate, a strong correlation (r = 0.89) was measured when generation times of 10 closely related lines of T. b. gambiense, and 2 lines of pleomorphic T. b. rhodesiense were compared to their LD50 values. While the rate of trypanosomal proliferation was similar between the day of inoculation through the second patent day, it slowed to 64% of that level once parasitemias exceeded 3 X 10(8) organisms/ml of host blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Black flies were identified morphologically and the monthly and seasonal contribution of different vector species to the transmission of Onchocerca volvulus at each site was determined. Simulium yahense was identified as the predominant vector species at each site. Greatest populations of this species occurred during wet season (May-Oct), but its impact on transmission of onchocerciasis was most profound during dry season (Nov-Apr) when parity, infection, and infectivity were high. S. sanctipauli was the only other vector species captured, but biting populations of this species were small, and during wet season confined primarily to the vicinity of its breeding site in the Farmington River. Dry season populations of S. sanctipauli were also characterized by lower human-biting rates, and by higher rates of parity, infection, and infectivity. Monthly transmission potentials at each site were attributed primarily to S. yahense, with peak monthly transmission occurring during the dry season months of January-April. Against the WHO standard of 100 as a \"tolerable\" annual level of onchocerciasis transmission, annual transmission potentials for the three sampling sites were 94, 1,877, and 4,900, with highest values being calculated for S. yahense breeding sites.\r"

Although well known to clinicians of another era, this disease currently may represent a diagnostic dilemma because of its infrequent occurrence and varied presentations. This report of trichinella encephalitis, presenting as quadriplegia, demonstrates that technological advances such as CAT scan, angiogram, and EEG are of no diagnostic assistance and add nothing to traditional diagnostic modalities, i.e., eosinophilia, sedimentation rate, and muscle biopsy. In some cases of trichinosis encephalitis where hypersensitivity reaction and/or vasculitis is believed to be the inciting factor, cortical steroids may have a role in treatment.\r"

The patients were identified by screening with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using purified Echinococcus multilocularis antigen (Em2 ELISA). Five patients, and one diagnosed earlier (1979), were found to have lesions in which the larval E. multilocularis had died spontaneously at an early stage of infection. Viability was assessed histologically; by the avidin-biotin immunohistochemical method; and in vivo through intraperitoneal inoculation of membranes of the larval cestode into red-backed voles, Clethrionomys rutilus. The results were in agreement with the clinical impression, based on findings by computerized tomography and ultrasound scanning, and on the macroscopic appearance of the lesions, that the cestode was dead. Spontaneous death of E. multilocularis in humans has not been previously reported. The findings show that the Em2 ELISA may be positive in patients having lesions of AHD in which the etiologic agent is no longer viable.\r"

Replicates of 11 sequential aerosol treatments applied 12 hr apart during a 5.5-day period reduced mean adult captures and oviposition rates during the treatment period 73% and 75%, respectively. We hypothesize that oviposition was not completely suppressed because females with a developing egg burden remained sequestered during treatment periods or were more tolerant to the pesticide. We further concluded that adults could not be totally suppressed because of continued emergence. After treatment, adult densities recovered to pretreatment and control levels within approximately 1 week. A simulation study of the results suggested that, under the conditions of closely spaced housing and abundant vegetation that is typical of much of New Orleans, a single aerosol killed an average of 88% of the males and only 30% of the females present.\r"

In trials 1-4, venereal infection rates averaged 46% and 45% in F2 females bloodfed 6-8 hr before and 7 days after exposure, respectively, to transovarially-infected males. These rates were similar to rates previously reported only in mosquitoes receiving a bloodmeal 6-8 days prior to mating. Lower rates (24%-31%) were obtained using F4 and F7 generation mosquitoes in trials 5B and 6. In most trials, oral and transovarial transmission rates by venereally infected females were less than 25%. In trial 5B, however, the transovarial transmission rates reached 60% and 94% in the second and third ovarian cycles, respectively, with filial infection rates of 46% and 65%, respectively. The oral transmission rate in this trial reached 38% after 32 days. LAC virus was not detected in first ovarian cycle progeny. It is concluded that higher venereal infection rates must be found and/or first ovarian cycle progeny shown to become infected, before venereal transmission can be considered to make more than a modest contribution to offsetting the erosion of virus prevalence during TO transmission.\r"

These are the first isolations of Alagoas virus from an arthropod. Replication of the virus occurred in laboratory-reared sand flies (Lutzomyia longipalpis) after inoculation. Bite and transovarial transmission of the virus was also demonstrated in experimentally infected sand flies. Alagoas virus neutralizing antibodies were found in sera of humans and animals living near the insect collection site; antibody rates among human residents of two nearby towns were 63% and 83%, respectively. Results of comparative serologic studies demonstrated that Alagoas virus is closely related antigenically to Indiana, Cocal, and Maraba viruses and that these four agents form a complex within the vesicular stomatitis virus serogroup. The antigenic similarity among these four viruses makes their differentiation difficult; it also raises doubts about the accuracy of current laboratory methods used for identifying isolates in this serogroup. A discussion follows on the significance of human antibodies to these agents and on the role of sand flies in their ecology.\r"

Although we mime our mentors, we have often received the torch of technique in the absence of a systematic program to optimally develop our manual dexterity. The operating room is the ultimate arena to refine one's technical ability, but a surgical skills laboratory should assume increasing importance in introducing the trainee to the many nuances of the fine manual motor skills necessary for optimal surgical technique. Surgical educators should address the science of surgical handicraft in a manner similar to the science of preoperative and postoperative surgical principles that have been espoused over the past 40 years. Although it has been euphemistically said that \"you can teach a monkey to operate,\" few of us have broken the process down into the basic elements to accomplish such a goal. In view of the increasing complexity of operations and equipment, the constraints on animal laboratories and teaching caseloads, and the mounting economic and medico-legal pressures, the development of optimal surgical skills should be a major objective of every surgical training program. By developing novel programs and scientifically evaluating the results of such endeavors, surgical faculties may find increased academic rewards for being a good teacher.\r"

The whole graft is suspect and must be assessed by aortography, but graft deterioration can be localized, which simplifies management. In our patients, holes in the body of the graft or near the bifurcation were approached transabdominally. We replaced as much of the graft as was reasonable under the circumstances. Two of the four patients died. Five patients had graft holes in the inguinal region which we believe were related to tethering in that area. For this reason, we recommend cutting the inguinal ligament and prosthetic limbs no more than 8 mm in diameter. Partial retroperitoneal resection with external sleeve support has been a durable alternative to a complete redo operation in patients with degeneration isolated to the inguinal area.\r"

There were significant changes in sphincter pressures postoperatively. Operation did not effect the preoperative electromyographic findings of the puborectalis muscle and external sphincter in our small postoperative population. The mechanism by which operation might influence these parameters has been discussed. Factors such as parity and the descending perineum syndrome may effect continence. Due to the length of time the sphincter is required to function in these patients and the multiplicity of factors involved, we believe that long-term studies are needed.\r"

  ".W": "During a 4 1/2 year period, 4,941 trauma patients were admitted to a hospital, and details of their injuries and treatment were entered in a computerized trauma registry. Using that database, patients with cervical spine injury were studied. Of the 4,941 patients, 1,823 (38 percent) had radiographs of the cervical spine. Ninety-four patients (5 percent) of these patients had injuries of the cervical spine or spinal cord. Sixty five of the 94 patients with cervical spine injury were alert. All had either neck pain or neck tenderness. We do not recommend screening cervical spine radiographs for the alert trauma patient without neck pain; however, we do recommend screening for all patients with decreased levels of consciousness and an injury that could have conceivably injured the cervical spine, for all patients with neurologic deficits compatible with a cervical origin, and for all patients with neck pain or tenderness. Lateral cervical spine radiographs were obtained in all injured patients. They demonstrated cervical spine injury in 70 patients (74 percent) and missed the injury in the remaining 24, which resulted in an unacceptable false-negative rate of 26 percent. We believe that all patients at risk for cervical spine injuries must have complete radiographic examinations of the cervical spine. Computerized axial tomography was the most useful modality to confirm a cervical spine injury in those patients whose lateral cervical spines appeared normal radiographically, especially in patients with associated head injury requiring computerized axial tomography of the brain. Computerized axial tomography diagnosed the injury in 14 of the 24 patients requiring study beyond initial screening. Also presented herein is a radiologic screening algorithm for cervical spine injuries in trauma patients.\r"

  ".W": "The dual tracer nuclear scintiscan using technetium and thallium to localize enlarged or ectopic parathyroid tissue has been reported to be highly accurate and efficacious. Fourteen previous series reporting results of the technique have been compiled from the literature and analyzed. This analysis has revealed a total of 317 surgically confirmed scan results with a low false-positive rate (17 of 317 scans), a sensitivity rate of 82 percent, and an overall accuracy rate of 78 percent. Forty-five patients from five Portland area hospitals have been retrospectively studied. They had a total of 49 preoperative scans. In our experience with the scan, a higher false-positive rate (4 of 45 scans), a sensitivity rate of 78 percent, and an overall accuracy rate of 73 percent were noted. The scan's effectiveness in acknowledged areas of difficulty in parathyroid surgery, such as patients with ectopic adenomas, hyperplastic glands, and those with previous neck explorations, has been analyzed. We conclude that the scan is a useful preoperative localization tool, especially in patients with ectopic adenomas or with persistent hypercalcemia after neck exploration. However, it is less accurate than initially reported in complex patients, and additional localization techniques are frequently required.\r"

We investigated the possibility that such a lining could be established by transmural capillary ingrowth in polytetrafluoroethylene (30 or 60 micron internodal distance) and Dacron baboon aortoiliac grafts of 4 mm in diameter and 5 to 7 cm in length. All grafts demonstrated endothelial ingrowth from the cut edges of adjacent artery. The central portions of the 30 micron polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were still not healed at 3 months. Two of six Dacron grafts were healed 1 month postoperatively and all were healed at 3 months, whereas all 60 micron polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were healed 2 weeks postoperatively. At early follow-up, islands of endothelium were seen in the middle of the 60 micron polytetrafluoroethylene and Dacron grafts. These observations support the concept that transmural migration of capillaries can provide multiple sources of endothelium and early endothelial coverage of porous synthetic arterial grafts. This response is affected by the porosity and possibly the thrombogenicity of the graft material.\r"

One hundred eighty-nine bypasses were formed from intact ipsilateral greater saphenous veins of adequate size and length. One hundred forty bypasses were formed in patients in whom the ipsilateral greater saphenous vein was absent or of inadequate size or length to complete the bypass. The grafts in these patients were accomplished using a variety of techniques including distal graft origin, use of arm veins and lesser saphenous veins, and use of vein splicing. The patency rates of these grafts were equivalent to those achieved using adequate intact ipsilateral greater saphenous vein. In view of these results, we conclude that the absence of a greater saphenous vein does not preclude successful autogenous lower extremity vein bypass and that prosthetic bypass is rarely justified.\r"

Oral intake was restricted postoperatively in half of the patients of each group. Anaesthesia comprised morphine and atropine premedication and a halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen spontaneous breathing technique. No significant beneficial effects resulted from intra-operative antiemetics; vomiting incidences of 26% after saline and droperidol, 28% after metoclopramide and 14% after prochlorperazine were observed. Younger patients and females vomited most frequently. Restriction of oral fluids did not decrease the incidence of vomiting but demonstrated that approximately half of those patients who vomit do so with their first postoperative oral intake. Vomiting was observed more frequently after non intra-ocular surgery than after intra-ocular surgery (37% cf. 16%, p less than 0.01) and postoperative analgesics were required by more non intra-ocular patients than by intra-ocular patients (25% cf. 5%, p less than 0.001). Squint patients vomited most frequently (48%) and most frequently required postoperative analgesia (35%).\r"

A defect in Ca2+ homeostasis has been suspected as underlying the disease, based on the preventive effect of dantrolene sodium, an agent thought to reduce Ca2+ levels in the cytoplasm. We describe here direct measurements of cytoplasmic ionized Ca2+ levels in lymphocytes from seven normal and 12 malignant hyperthermia-susceptible pigs, using the fluorescent indicator quin2. No differences in the concentration of cytoplasmic ionized Ca2+ were found in cells from malignant hyperthermia-susceptible pigs (160 +/- 10 nM) relative to the controls (150 +/- 10 nM). However, addition of halothane in vitro caused a significant increase (to 270 +/- 30 nM) in lymphocytes from malignant hyperthermia-susceptible pigs, but not from normal pigs (180 +/- 10 nM). The halothane-mediated increase in cytoplasmic ionized Ca2+ required extracellular Ca2+. It is suggested that general anesthetics such as halothane increase the permeability of the cell surface to Ca2+, and that this increase may, on its own or indirectly, increase the cytoplasmic level of ionized Ca2+ during a malignant hyperthermia crisis. The detection of a halothane-dependent increase in cytoplasmic ionized Ca2+ selectively in malignant hyperthermia-susceptible pigs could be the basis for a noninvasive test for malignant hyperthermia.\r"

It provides a convenient, noninvasive way to image cardiac anatomy and intracardiac blood flow that is applicable to intraoperative use. We describe its use in one normal subject and seven cardiac surgical patients. Blood flow characteristics as visualized by TEDCFM are described for these patients. Transesophageal Doppler color flow mapping provided specific information about the presence, site, and severity of mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, and interatrial shunting. Paravalvular leak was detected in one patient after mitral valve replacement. The intimal tear of a type I aortic dissection was located with positive identification of the true and false lumina. A high incidence of mild asymptomatic mitral regurgitation was found in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\r"

  ".W": "The effects of U-50488H, a selective kappa-analgesic, on the minimum anesthetic concentration (MAC) of an inhalational agent (halothane) were studied in the rat. U-50488H was given subcutaneously in doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg body weight. The maximal MAC reduction was about 60%. The potency ratio of U-50488H to morphine in this model was comparable with potency ratios in other analgesic assays. In separate experiments, the percent reduction in halothane MAC with U-50488H at 30 mg/kg was determined during the infusion of naloxone (5 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 and 1 mg X kg-1 X min-1) at doses shown to have reversed a 70% reduction in MAC by 10 mg/kg of morphine. Only when naloxone was infused at 1 mg X kg-1 X min-1 was there a significant reversal of the U-50488H-induced reduction in halothane MAC. This observation suggests that the reduction in MAC of halothane with U-50488H was not mediated by a mu-receptor. In conclusion, through the use of a selective pharmacologic tool that stimulates kappa-receptors we have demonstrated potential utility of kappa-analgesics as supplements to general anesthesia.\r"

Mean plasma umbilical venous bupivacaine levels (20.2 +/- 21 ng/ml) were 7% of those found after epidural anesthesia. Mean umbilical venous/maternal venous bupivacaine ratios were 0.34 +/- 0.12 and mean umbilical arterial/umbilical venous ratios were 0.81 +/- 0.30. No bupivacaine was detectable in neonatal plasma 24 hr after delivery. Neonatal urine had measurable levels of both bupivacaine and its inactive metabolite, 2,6-pipecolylxylidine (PPX), for at least 36 hr after delivery. The results demonstrate that bupivacaine crosses the placenta and reaches the fetus, but in very low amounts. This transplacental passage occurs despite injection of only small doses of a very highly protein bound drug into the subarachnoid space.\r"

Therefore, the authors studied ten patients after anesthetic induction with thiopental, fentanyl, tracheal intubation aided by succinylcholine and maintenance with diazepam, pancuronium, N2O, and further doses of fentanyl. Eight of the patients underwent cholecystectomy, one had a hysterectomy, and another had an abdominoplasty. After reversal of neuromuscular block at the conclusion of surgery, normal ventilation was restored by 0.22 +/- 0.02 mg/kg intravenous nalbuphine (mean +/- SEM). Plasma levels of free norepinephrine, histamine, and cortisol did not increase after antagonism of the fentanyl-induced respiratory depression, but plasma concentration of epinephrine increased significantly but without significant hemodynamic changes. Minute ventilation was 1.5 +/- 0.4 L/min before and 11 +/- 1, 10 +/- 1, 11 +/- 1, and 10 +/- 1 L/min at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after antagonism; corresponding PaCO2 levels were 56 +/- 2, 44 +/- 1, 49 +/- 7, 49 +/- 1, 42 +/- 1 mm Hg. The mean analogue pain score remained below 1.5. We conclude that nalbuphine effectively antagonizes fentanyl-induced respiratory depression without adverse endocrine and circulatory changes or loss of analgesia.\r"

This relationship was studied after the administration of the full dose of the relaxant in all groups. Of all the priming doses, 0.08 mg/kg atracurium, when followed 3 min later by 0.42 mg/kg atracurium, had a significantly greater fade in the TOF ratio at any given T1 value. This may indicate significant prejunctional activity. Acceleration of the onset of neuromuscular blockade was, however, evident in all groups that received atracurium in divided doses. The implication is, therefore, that prejunctional activity may not contribute significantly to the acceleration of onset of neuromuscular blockade after administration of atracurium in divided doses, as described in this study.\r"

The authors monitored changes in anterior fontanel pressure (AFP), a noninvasive indicator of ICP, during anesthesia in 44 preterm neonates without neurologic disease. Atropine, 0.02 mg/kg, and pancuronium, 0.1 mg/kg, were given intravenously to all patients, who were ventilated with oxygen and air. Anterior fontanel pressure was monitored and recorded continuously with a Ladd AFP monitor. Systolic blood pressure (SAP) and mean blood pressure (MAP) were recorded at 1-min intervals. After a 5-min control period of stable AFP, each of the four groups of 11 patients then received either 0.75% isoflurane, 0.5% halothane, 20 micrograms/kg fentanyl, or 2 mg/kg ketamine. Anterior fontanel pressure decreased 11% during isoflurane administration, 9% during halothane administration, 10% after fentanyl, and 10% after ketamine. These changes were statistically significant, but clinically mild, and AFP remained within the normal range. Statistically significant decreases in SAP and MAP occurred during isoflurane and halothane administration, but not after fentanyl or ketamine. The authors conclude that indirectly measured ICP decreases slightly in preterm neonates without neurologic disease after administration of the anesthetics studied. The difference between these results and those of studies of ICP in adults is presumably due to the compliance of the neonate's open-sutured cranium.\r"

One group received 10 ml of 0.125% bupivacaine plus epinephrine 1:800,000, the other group received 7 ml of 0.375% bupivacaine plus epinephrine 1:800,000. Plasma concentrations of bupivacaine in the umbilical venous (UV) and the umbilical arterial (UA) blood of their babies were also determined. The mean UA, UV, and maternal central venous (MV) plasma concentrations of bupivacaine differed significantly between the two groups: in patients given 0.375% bupivacaine UA values were 63% higher (P less than 0.01), UV values were 57% higher (P less than 0.01), and the MV values were 34% higher (P less than 0.05) than in patients given 0.125% bupivacaine. The measured plasma concentrations speak in favor of the less concentrated solution of bupivacaine in epidural analgesia for obstetrics. Seven milliliters of bupivacaine 0.375% is suitable for epidural analgesia in obstetrics but a low concentration-low dose technique, using 10 ml of bupivacaine 0.125% plus epinephrine 1:800,000 is safer. It provides good analgesia with minimal or no motor block and is associated with low maternal and neonatal plasma concentrations of bupivacaine, well below toxic levels and, to our knowledge, lower than in any other study.\r"

Fatal anesthetic concentration (the numerator for FAR) was defined as the end-tidal concentration at which the pig lived at least 10 min, during experiments that involved step increments in anesthetic concentrations. Previously reported MAC was used as the \"anesthetic\" concentration (denominator) to determine FAR. Halothane was compared to isoflurane and the question of whether major surgery might reduce FAR was investigated. The major surgery groups included one open chest group with each volatile anesthetic studied during coronary reserve measurements, and two groups that had LAD critical coronary stenoses. Thus volatile agents were compared with vs without major surgery, and with vs without a critical coronary stenosis. The FAR for isoflurane was approximately double that of halothane. Further, addition of major surgery did not produce significant deterioration in FAR with isoflurane. In contrast, with halothane there was a significant (approximately 20%) decrease in FAR, despite values already only half that seen with isoflurane, when major surgery was added. Presence of a critical coronary stenosis was not associated with a worsened FAR for isoflurane or halothane. It was concluded that the fatal/anesthetic ratio for isoflurane in pigs is 1.9 times greater than that for halothane. Addition of major surgery did not affect FAR when isoflurane was the anesthetic but did when halothane was used. Critical coronary stenosis did not worsen FAR. Because these results are nearly identical with those reported previously in small mammals, the doubled safety margin seen with isoflurane may have clinical relevance.\r"

All patients were lucid on admission. Using the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) as criteria for confusion, we found that 44% of the patients developed confusion that correlated closely to a history of mental depression (P less than 0.01) and to the use of drugs with anticholinergic effect (P less than 0.005). There was no difference in the incidence of confusion between the two anesthetic groups. In patients given halothane, however, early postoperative hypoxemia was associated with confusion (P less than 0.05). Patients with confusion had significantly more postoperative complications and almost four times longer hospitalization times. It is concluded that anticholinergic medication and a history of mental depression are predominant risk factors for development of postoperative confusion and in this respect are more important than the anesthetic technique.\r"

The impedance epigastrograph used consisted of a four-electrode array (two source, two detector) that was applied over the epigastrium. The method was sufficiently sensitive to measure the effects of pregnancy, labor, and narcotics on gastric emptying. There was no difference in the rate of gastric emptying between pregnant and nonpregnant females. Labor appeared to cause a significant delay in gastric emptying; the mean +/- SEM time taken for the gastric volume to decrease to 50% (T0.5) was 7.2 +/- 0.6 min during pregnancy and 13.0 +/- 1.9 min in the immediate postpartum period. However, the principal factor associated with the delay in gastric emptying in the group studied within 60 min of delivery was probably the use of meperidine and promethazine, because there was a significant difference (P less than 0.05) between subjects who received meperidine and promethazine during labor and those in another group who had received either no analgesia or extradural analgesia, the T0.5 values for the two groups being 18.2 +/- 4.0 and 10.3 +/- 1.4 min, respectively.\r"

Rats were pretreated with triorthotolyl phosphate (TOTP), an inhibitor of the hydrolytic degradation of atracurium. Because hydrolysis of acrylates is also inhibited by TOTP and because the hydrolysis represents a detoxification pathway for these esters, we postulated that the leak of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) induced by atracurium would be enhanced in hepatocytes harvested from rats pretreated with TOTP. Hepatocytes isolated from rats previously treated with TOTP (25 or 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally, 20 hr before induced death) were incubated for 4 hr in the absence of muscle relaxants or in the presence of either atracurium (0.008-0.8 mM) or metocurine (0.015-0.85 mM). Atracurium produced a concentration-dependent leakage of LDH. The leakage out of cells obtained from TOTP-pretreated rats was greater than was the leakage out of hepatocytes harvested from animals pretreated only with corn oil (a vehicle for TOTP). Metocurine did not produce a leak of LDH. It is concluded that the LDH leakage was produced by ester-type products of atracurium degradation. Acrylates appear to be the toxic agent.\r"

Injections were administered intramuscularly, bilaterally in the masseter muscles, once a day on days 10 and 11 of pregnancy. Twelve control rats were given physiologic saline. Clinical signs, mortality, body weight, and food consumption were recorded during pregnancy and lactation. The duration of gestation was also recorded. The development of the offspring was monitored by tests of spontaneous activity, nociception, learning ability, and physical development. No clinical signs of adverse reactions were seen in any of the groups. In the majority of the learning ability tests, the control and lidocaine-treated groups showed similar results. However, in the schedule of differential reinforcement of low rates of responding (DRL 20), the lidocaine-exposed males received more reinforcements than the controls and made fewer responses. In the tests of nociception, a significant difference between sexes was recorded, in that the females were more sensitive than the males in the shock-titration test. Physical development, as monitored by swimming ability and spontaneous activity, showed no inter-group difference. The present results indicate that prenatal exposure to lidocaine fails to result in postnatal impairment of the development of behavioral performance of a wide range of tasks.\r"

Patients were injected while in the lateral recumbent position and were immediately turned supine and horizontal. Up to 30 min after injection, no differences were found between the groups regarding segmental level of analgesia, changes in heart rate, and onset to or maximum decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP). No correlation was found between maximum decrease in MAP and level of analgesia. At time of maximum decrease in MAP (tetracaine group - 16.7 +/- 12.8% (mean + SEM), bupivacaine group -19.4 + 14.8%) the level of analgesia was significantly higher in the tetracaine group (T5-6) than in the bupivacaine group (T7-8). Hypotension occurred in five patients in the bupivacaine group and in six in the tetracaine group. Two patients in the tetracaine group (but none in the bupivacaine group) had bradycardia. Hypotension together with bradycardia was observed in one patient in the tetracaine group but in no patient in the bupivacaine group. Two patients in each group developed postlumbar puncture headache. The authors conclude that the choice of local anesthetic agent, by itself, is not the sole cause of hypotension seen with spinal anesthesia.\r"

There have been reports of neurodysfunction associated with these injections, and it has been postulated that the PEG vehicle is the offending agent. Studies supporting such a possibility have, however, relied upon concentrations of PEG higher than those used clinically (3%) or have used PEG in combination with other drugs. Using an in vitro rabbit sheathed-nerve preparation, we investigated the effects of a 1-hr exposure to different concentrations (3-40%) of PEG in Liley solution on the transmission of impulses of the A, B, and C nerve fibers. The 3% and 10% PEG had no effect on mean amplitudes of the compound action potentials (CAPs) nor did they significantly decrease conduction velocity. Twenty percent PEG slightly depressed and 30% markedly decreased CAPs. Both 20% and 30% PEG significantly slowed the conduction velocities of A, B, and C nerve fibers. Forty percent PEG abolished CAPs. With washout CAPs recovered to at least 80% of their baseline levels, and conduction velocities returned toward baseline levels. The pH of the Liley solution decreased with an increasing concentration of PEG, from 7.4 in the control Liley solution to 6.45 in the solution of 40% PEG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the first part of the study, when a standard amount of saline solution was infused (in 24 dogs), dopamine infusion resulted in higher cardiac filling pressures than did dobutamine infusion, whereas dobutamine infusion resulted in higher cardiac output. In the second part of the study, when fluid infusion was titrated to maintain pulmonary artery balloon-occluded pressure at constant level (in 24 dogs), the total amount of fluids was significantly greater with dobutamine than when dopamine was used (109 +/- 13 vs 71 +/- 10 ml/kg). The combination of dobutamine with fluids resulted in significantly greater stroke volume (39.6 +/- 3.8 vs 21.0 +/- 4.0 ml, P less than 0.05) and oxygen consumption (194 +/- 18 vs 144 +/- 8 ml/min, P less than 0.05). The different effects of dopamine and dobutamine on cardiac filling pressures can be due to differences in effects on myocardial contractility, ventricular afterload, and cardiac compliance. This experimental study indicates that when fluid therapy is combined with adrenergic agents in resuscitation from septic shock, dobutamine can be associated with higher cardiac output and oxygen transport and can result in higher tissue oxygen consumption than dopamine.\r"

  ".W": "In this report, the authors present the results of 34 estimates of pulmonary capillary pressure (Pcap) in 15 adult patients receiving intensive care for acute respiratory failure (ARF). Within the pulmonary artery pressure profile during transient balloon occlusion, the authors identified two exponential pressure decay components-the slower one representing the discharge of the pulmonary capillary pressure through the pulmonary venous resistance. By extrapolating this exponential to its origin at the moment of pulmonary artery occlusion, a pressure within the pulmonary vascular bed which approximates pulmonary capillary pressure (Pcap) was identified. Pcap, and not the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), is the major driving pressure forcing fluid from the pulmonary microvasculature. The results indicate that a discrete value for pulmonary capillary pressure can be reproducibly measured in paralyzed ventilated patients. The data report that mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary pressure, and total pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) are increased in acute respiratory failure, but there is considerable variation in the distribution of pulmonary vascular resistance between the arterial and venous beds. The data suggest that there is unequal and variable partitioning of the increased PVR during acute respiratory failure. Bedside pressure profile Pcap measurements will allow optimum reduction of Pcap during ARF by infusing vasoactive agents to modify the distribution of PVR or reducing the PAOP.\r"

In both groups, epidural blockade was performed with 10 ml 0.5% plain bupivacaine. To differentiate the effects due to epidural blockade from those related to volume expansion, three sets of measurements were obtained: control, epidural blockade without volume loading, and epidural blockade with volume loading (500 ml lactated Ringer's solution). Radionuclide angiography was used to determine cardiac output, left ventricular ejection fraction, end systolic and end diastolic volumes, and to analyse left ventricular wall motion. Peak systolic pressure-end systolic volume ratio was used as an index of myocardial contractility. Seventy-two hours postoperatively, a thallium 201 myocardial scintigraphy obtained after iv dipyridamole detected myocardial defects in all patients with a history of angina. These defects were fully redistributed in eight out of ten patients. Throughout the procedure, patients with a history of angina exhibited neither chest pain nor ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia. At control, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and systolic pressure-volume ratio (SPVR) were lower in group 2 than in group 1 (LVEF: 0.54 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.02, P less than 0.01), (SPVR: 2.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.3 +/- 0.4 mmHg/ml, P less than 0.05).

The extent and duration of the effects of etomidate (63 +/- 6.4 mg) on spontaneous and stimulated corticosteroid levels, as well as on plasma concentrations of ACTH, beta-endorphin, and catecholamines were examined and compared to those following administration of the new benzodiazepine, midazolam, or of methohexital. Twenty-nine healthy, young, male orthopedic patients were randomized into three groups receiving either etomidate/fentanyl (n = 12), midazolam/fentanyl (n = 8), or methohexital/fentanyl (n = 9). Etomidate caused cortisol levels to decrease from 12.5 +/- 1.2 micrograms/dl preoperatively to 5.9 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl after operation (P less than 0.001), compared to an increase from 12.0 +/- 1.9 micrograms/dl to 18.5 +/- 2.9 micrograms/dl in the group receiving methohexital. At 6 and 20 h postoperatively, all cortisol levels were normal. The cortisol decrease from 12.5 +/- 1.7 to 7.6 +/- 1.5 caused by midazolam was similar to that following etomidate, but the response to exogenous ACTH was significantly impaired in patients receiving etomidate as compared to those receiving midazolam. ACTH and beta-endorphin levels increased in patients receiving etomidate, presumably as a result of the interruption of negative feedback due to cortisol synthesis inhibition. Midazolam on the other hand prevented the increase of ACTH and beta-endorphin levels. Etomidate completely suppressed spontaneous aldosterone levels (from 33 +/- 6.7 to 7 +/- 2.1 pg/ml), as well as the response to stimulation with exogenous ACTH without affecting serum electrolytes. Etomidate had no influence on plasma catecholamines, but midazolam attenuated the stress-related epinephrine increase.\r"

In order to determine whether these factors also influence FRC in children during anesthesia, 20 preschool children were studied, 10 while receiving ketamine, and 10 during halothane anesthesia. Te was measured during quiet breathing and the passive expiratory time constant (tau) was determined from the passive expiratory flow volume (V/V) curve following a brief end inspiratory airway occlusion. The number of time constants available for expiration, Te/tau, was then calculated. The difference between FRC and the relaxation volume of the respiratory system (Vrs) (FRC-Vrs) was measured by extrapolating the linear segment of the V/V curve to zero flow, and measuring FRC-Vrs. During ketamine anesthesia, tau was markedly prolonged (1.15 s, range 0.73-2.29 s), with the result that Te/tau was, in all subjects, less than 2. Children anesthetized with halothane had shorter tau (0.38 s, range 0.24-0.65 s), and Te/tau was more than 2 in most subjects. FRC-Vrs was significantly greater in the subjects from the ketamine group (203 ml, range 115-392 ml) than in those from the halothane group (32 ml, range 1-71 ml). For the 20 subjects, there was a significant relationship between FRC-Vrs (ml) and Te/tau described by the equation. FRC-Vrs = 845.0e-1.28(Te/tau) The authors conclude that, in children during ketamine anesthesia, tau is prolonged and, in these children, the relationship of Te to tau is an important determinant of FRC-Vrs. Te/tau was not related causally to FRC-Vrs in the halothane group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Measurements were made at three coronary perfusion pressures before nitrous oxide administration, and then repeated following the addition of both 30% and 60% nitrous oxide. At the same time, coronary arteriolar tone was assessed by measuring coronary blood flow using 133Xenon washout. Sixty percent nitrous oxide was accompanied by constriction of the epicardial coronary arteries. Thirty percent nitrous oxide had a less marked effect. At 70 mmHg coronary perfusion pressure, following 60% nitrous oxide, mid left anterior descending cross-sectional area decreased from 4.6 +/- 0.3 mm2 (mean +/- SD) to 3.5 +/- 0.3 mm2. At 90 mmHg, area decreased from 4.57 +/- 0.3 mm2 to 3.69 +/- 0.4 mm2, and, at 110 mmHg, from 4.7 +/- 0.4 mm2 to 3.9 +/- 0.4 mm2 (P less than 0.01). Nitrous oxide had no effect on the relationship between coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption, indicating an absence of effect on coronary arteriolar tone. It is concluded that intramyocardial coronary arterioles and epicardial coronary arteries are dissimilar in their response to nitrous oxide. In the intact, anesthetized, normal dog, nitrous oxide does not affect coronary arteriolar tone. Sixty percent nitrous oxide produces constriction of epicardial coronary arteries.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether anesthetics modify mediator release, the authors measured the amount of histamine released by d-tubocurarine (dTC) in human foreskin preparations in the presence of high (2.0%) and low (0.5%) halothane concentrations and nitrous oxide (10%). Freshly excised human foreskins were divided into four matched pieces. Two matched pieces were aerated with oxygen, and the other two with an oxygen-anesthetic gas mixture. One chamber of each served as a control, while the other was stimulated with 3 X 10(-5) M d-tubocurarine for 30 min. Supernatant histamine concentrations were measured by automated fluorometry. Percent histamine release was determined by dividing the experimentally released histamine concentration by the total histamine released after the tissue was sonicated and boiled. Neither halothane nor N2O alone altered spontaneous histamine release. Histamine release by d-tubocurarine was significantly reduced by 2% halothane compared to d-tubocurarine alone (2.8% +/- 0.9 vs. 13.9% +/- 3.7, mean + SEM) (P less than 0.05) in the in vitro preparation. Histamine release was reduced in the preparations pretreated with 0.5% halothane group, but this was not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05) when compared to d-tubocurarine alone. N2O (10%) did not reduce d-tubocurarine-induced histamine release. The authors conclude that halothane, in clinically used concentrations, significantly impairs histamine release from human neonatal foreskin preparations.\r"

  ".W": "Anesthesia and surgery are a risk for all, the healthy as well as the sick. While the prevention of adverse outcomes in healthy patients is paramount, enhancement of safety for critically ill patients is also essential, since they are more likely to suffer a SNO after a critical incident. Dangers originate from a variety of sources, not solely from errors by the anesthesiologist. Simple incidents of all description are inevitable, and we should focus on promoting recovery as well as avoiding error. Processes that lead to negative outcomes after critical incidents should be investigated to reduce the uncertainty complexity associated with managing the human body during anesthesia, and to establish the most effective detection and recovery techniques. Outcome studies are lacking, and clinical and animal research is highly dependent on the chosen model or population, making the results hard to apply to variable clinical conditions. Wherever possible, a consensus should be sought on therapeutic and adverse effects of drugs and techniques in common, specific patient populations. These can serve as a basis for developing therapeutic plans, recognizing that customizing to individuals is always necessary. A mainstay of anesthetic practice already involves attempts to loosen couplings, by keeping homeostatic mechanisms intact when possible (awake intubation, regional anesthesia); providing temporal buffers (titration of drugs, and use of drugs with short onset times and rapid termination of effect); and providing safety margins using appropriate pre-treatments (pre-oxygenation, atropine in children, etc.). Further means of loosening coupling should be identified and promoted. Specific attention to recovery from simple incidents should attack several facets of the problem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Five dogs were anesthetized, intubated, and ventilated with various mixtures of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon monoxide. Each dog was monitored with arterial and pulmonary artery catheters, a transcutaneous PO2 analyzer, and two pulse oximeters. An IL-282 Co-oximeter was used to periodically measure arterial oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) as percentages of the total hemoglobin. The PaO2, PaCO2, and pHa were measured in the same blood specimens using standard electrodes. When the inspired oxygen concentration was reduced in the absence of COHb, the pulse oximeter saturation (SpO2) estimated O2Hb with reasonable accuracy. COHb levels were then varied slowly from 0-75% in each dog. As the COHb level increased and oxyhemoglobin decreased, both pulse oximeters continued to read an oxygen saturation of greater than 90%, while the actual O2Hb fell below 30%. In the presence of COHb, the SpO2 is approximately the sum of COHb and O2Hb, and, thus, may seriously overestimate O2Hb. The pulse oximeter, as the sole indicator of blood oxygenation, should, therefore, be used with caution in patients with recent carbon monoxide exposure. On the other hand, transcutaneous PO2 falls linearly as COHb increases, and reaches about one-fifth of its initial value at the highest COHb levels despite the maintenance of constant arterial PO2.\r"

In preliminary tests with cat muscle, uptake varied with skeletal muscle fiber type, was absent from smooth muscle, and was blocked by agents which damage or extract sarcoplasmic reticulum. In the human biopsies, however, the calcium uptake values showed no significant correlation with any of the following parameters: time of frozen-biopsy storage up to 5 yr; fiber type distribution; positive versus negative response in the halothane contracture test; positive versus negative response in the caffeine contracture test; positive versus negative response in the combined halothane/caffeine contracture test; and presence of a documented clinical episode of malignant hyperthermia. In contrast, a positive halothane or caffeine contracture test each correlated highly with the presence of a prior clinical episode. We conclude that the evidence fails to support the use of the Ca45 uptake procedure in frozen sections of skeletal muscle biopsies as a valid indicator of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.\r"

Two indexes were calculated: P = T/C-C/S (T/C and C/S were the absolute values of radioactivity ratios measured before medical treatment) and R = delta(C/S)-delta(T/C) (where delta expressed the relative variation of the ratios measured after treatment and compared with initial values). Angiography was performed on all patients prior to treatment, and the results were quantified as 1 in the case of obliteration and 0.5 in case of stenosis of major arterial axes. Clinical improvement was demonstrated by a 100% increase in walking distance for stage II disease, abolition of pain at rest for stage III disease, and reepithelialization of trophic lesions for stage IV disease. Paraclinical effectiveness was evaluated by measuring ankle systolic pressure (SP) and index (SI) before and after treatment. The correlation observed between the values of P and angiography results was p less than 0.025 (Student t-test). The mean of P (measured before treatment) was 1.75 for the improved patients and 0.56 for the others (p less than 0.005). After treatment, R was +58% for improved patients versus -13% in those in whom the treatment was inefficient (p less than 0.025). P expresses the microcirculatory effects of arterial lesions detected by angiography. It is a prognostic index: satisfactory proximal perfusion (high T/C), associated with lesions that are essentially peripheral (low C/S), predicting a positive effect of medical treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Much care had been taken to be certain that all patients had primary Raynaud's phenomenon. The results of digital pressure measurements appeared to be affected by interindividual variations in systemic systolic blood pressure. By introducing a digit-to-brachial systolic blood pressure index (DBI), such variations could be eliminated. Instant cold provocation did not change DBI significantly. No pressure drop due to a closing phenomenon could be observed. Both digital skin temperature and DBI differed significantly between healthy males and females. In the patient group males and females did not show significant differences. The results in healthy females were hardly different from the results in patients. Healthy males could be well discriminated from patients with both techniques. Sex differentiation appeared to be essential for the objective assessment of primary Raynaud's phenomenon.\r"

The condition is more acute in children, with fulminant course. Ten children were diagnosed as having CFA out of three hundred children seen over a period of 3 years. Diagnosis was established by characteristic clinical findings and laboratory evaluation. All the children had tachypnoea at rest and bilateral crepitations in the absence of fever. Diffuse bilateral persistent irregular shadows were noted on the chest X-ray of these children. Pulmonary function studies revealed a restrictive type of abnormality with low transfer factor for carbon monoxide in six children. Open lung biopsy was done in eight children. The biopsy material was graded according to nine morphologic variables. Administration of steroids early in the course of illness resulted in amelioration of symptoms in 60% of the patients.\r"

The other 43 subjects were considered to have pseudo-allergic reactions (PSAR). The pharmacologic treatment was performed for 4 to 6 weeks and each patient had a free diet during the study. At the end of the treatment, both the patient and the allergist filled a score questionnaire concerning the clinical status in order to evaluate the clinical improvement. Our data indicate that anti-H1 antihistamines do not significantly differ from placebos, that oral cromolyn is more successful in food allergy than in PSAR patients (P less than .05), that ketotifen is helpful, and that the association of H1 and H2 anti-histamine drugs is even more effective. Finally, by considering the effect on the immune system exerted by these drugs, as recently demonstrated in our laboratory, a detailed balance of each therapeutic protocol is then analyzed.\r"

Azelastine administered as an aerosol produced significant inhibition of acute lung anaphylactic responses, ie, the reduction in dynamic lung compliance and an increase in pulmonary airway resistance. These data showed that regardless of the method of sensitization and time of administration (immediately or 15 minutes before antigen challenge), aerosolized azelastine affords significant protection against acute lung anaphylaxis. The inhibition of acute lung anaphylaxis by aerosolized azelastine in the guinea pig asthma model may be due to (1) inhibition of the synthesis/release of chemical mediators, eg, histamine and leukotrienes, etc and/or (2) antagonism of the pharmacologic mediators at the receptor site in respiratory smooth muscles.\r"

Theophylline is monitored through a serum theophylline level, which is dependent both on the amount of medication taken, the specific preparation ingested, as well as the amount of time between medication ingestion and serum level. The physician must know specific pharmacokinetic data to ascertain the preparation to use and the proper time to draw levels.

These findings suggest that the corticosteroid-induced anti-inflammatory effects at allergic reaction sites do not include inhibition of local mediator release. Furthermore, the steroid-induced inhibition of inflammatory cell accumulation is not specific for the allergic reaction.\r"

Aspirin-intolerant asthmatics were challenged with a previously established ASA threshold dose and, in nine of them, a positive asthmatic reaction occurred (mean fall in FEV1 39.4%). Seven out of nine patients with a positive reaction had a significant decrease in euglobulin lysis time (P less than .01) during AIB. A positive reaction after ASA was accompanied by an increase in the plasma recalcification time in five of these patients. There were no concomitant statistically significant changes in the platelet count, circulating platelet aggregates, and platelet factor 4 activity. In a control group of ASA-tolerant asthmatics, aspirin at a 200-mg dose did not evoke any respiratory reaction and, during two hours after ASA, no significant variation was found in any of the laboratory parameters studied. We conclude that activation of fibrinolysis accompanying AIB results from intrinsic pharmacologic properties of aspirin, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of aspirin intolerance through a more generalized activation of plasma proteolytic activity.\r"

The patient's lymphocyte counts were low and his lymphocytes were unable to produce IgG and IgA in vitro. The immunoglobulin-bearing cell studies also failed to demonstrate IgG and IgA bearing cells. Active Tac+ T cells, total T cells, and T cell subsets were at very low levels. Lymphoproliferative response to mitogens was also poor. Migration inhibitory factor production to Candida antigen was also decreased. The initial lymph node biopsy demonstrated no follicular formation and extensive depletion of lymphocytes in both thymic-dependent and thymic-independent areas. After Thymostimulin (a specific bovine thymic extract, TP-1) treatment, the second lymph node biopsy demonstrated germinal centers containing IgA-bearing cells and IgM-bearing cells and, subsequently, cortical and medullary differentiation. Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM became detectable at low levels and IgG-, IgA-, and IgM-bearing lymphocytes appeared in the peripheral blood. This also correlated with in vitro immunoglobulin synthesis. Active Tac+ T cells, total T cells, T cell subsets and lymphoproliferative response to mitogens increased gradually after thymostimulin therapy. This investigation demonstrated the therapeutic effectiveness of Thymostimulin in combined immunodeficiency both histologically and immunologically and the successful reconstitution of B cell function that did not require continued therapy.\r"

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) permits control of pressure, flow, oxygenation, temperature, and composition of blood. After 12 1/2 minutes of normothermic VF cardiac arrest, CPB was used as a research tool for reperfusion and assisted circulation for two hours in ten dogs without thoracotomy, with plasma substitute priming, and without preceding CPR (a deliberately nonclinical scenario). Recovery was compared with that in ten control dogs in which standard CPR with advanced life support (ALS) for up to 30 minutes was used to achieve ROSC. Both groups subsequently had blood pressure, blood gases, ventilation, and other parameters controlled for 20 hours, and intensive therapy to 72 hours. CPB achieved ROSC more successfully (ten of ten vs six of ten controls) (P less than .05), and more rapidly, with fewer defibrillation attempts and with less epinephrine (P less than .05). CPB improved 72-hour survival (seven of ten vs two of ten controls) (P = .025). Between two and 24 hours, of those with ROSC, intractable cardiogenic shock killed four of six control dogs (NS). CPB was followed by fewer arrhythmias. CPB increased recovery of consciousness (five of ten CPB vs zero of six controls with ROSC) (P = .037), but achieved neurologic normality in only one of ten.

The purpose of our investigation was to compare the effectiveness of femoro-femoral veno-arterial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the treatment of prolonged cardiopulmonary arrest. Ten mongrel dogs were electrically fibrillated and left in cardiopulmonary arrest without any therapy for 12 minutes. Subsequently, either CPB (n = 5) or CPR (n = 5) was initiated and resuscitation attempted according to a standardized protocol that included administration of the calcium channel blocker lidoflazine in an effort to optimize cerebral and myocardial recovery. If there was return of spontaneous circulation, the animal was managed in an intensive care setting with invasive hemodynamic monitoring and ventilatory support for up to nine hours. Neurologic function was graded using a standardized neurologic deficit scoring (NDS) system at 12 hours after insult and daily for one week or until death. Prearrest hemodynamic and metabolic parameters were comparable in both groups (P greater than .05). All CPB animals were resuscitated successfully and alive at 24 hours after insult as opposed to none in the CPR group (P less than .005). In addition, three of the CPB animals were neurologically normal at final grading with NDS scores of zero. The other two CPB animals had persistent severe neurologic impairment and a mean NDS score of 51%. Thus CPB is more effective than CPR in the treatment of prolonged cardiopulmonary arrest. The improved outcome probably results primarily from improvement in blood flow with CPB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Verapamil rapidly reversed the experimental calcium-induced arrest and improved survival (83% survival versus 0% in controls). Magnesium failed to reverse this toxic event. We conclude from these experimental studies that verapamil may be useful in the treatment of hypercalcemic cardiac toxicity.\r"

Little of the trauma literature addresses injury to the cervicothoracic junction (C7-T1); we were able to find only two studies that evaluated the incidence of injury in this area. The spinal injury registry of St Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center and Barrow's Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, was reviewed for cervical spine-injured patients. Of the 397 patients with cervical spine injury admitted between January 1980 and June 1985, 37 (9%) had cervicothoracic junction injury. Documentation of signs and symptoms of neck injury was recorded for each patient. All available lateral cervical spine radiographs were evaluated for indirect evidence of injury through the level of C7 as currently recommended in the trauma literature. Films were reviewed after being masked at the middle of the body of C7 thereby visualizing the C6-C7 junction. The incidence of C7-T1 injury in our cervical spine-injured population was 9%. Nine of the patients (24%) had a depressed level of consciousness and had neurologic examination that was not diagnostic of spinal injury. All of the cervical injuries in these patients were diagnosed by radiographic evaluation alone. We recommend that adequate visualization of the cervical spine through the cervicothoracic junction must be the standard for trauma care.\r"

Thirty-eight isolates belonged to the genus Vibrio and included six species. Twenty-four non-fermentative bacteria and four Gram-positive isolates were recovered. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that while the non-fermentative marine bacteria generally were susceptible to the antibiotics tested, marine Vibrio species were relatively resistant to a wide variety of antimicrobials. Antibiotics effective against all species included imipenem, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Further recommendations for treatment are based on sensitivity in culture. Some isolates failed to grow in the medium used for susceptibility testing. Because commercial test kits may not yield accurate identifications of bacteria, the acquisition of antimicrobial susceptibility data gains added importance.\r"

We report a prospective randomized trial of two methods of intubation in this patient population. Fifty-two overdose patients with Glascow Coma Scale scores of 12 or less were intubated either orotracheally after succinylcholine administration or nasotracheally. Success rate, time to intubate, difficulty, and complications of intubation were compared for the two groups. We found a success rate of 100% (23 of 23) for succinylcholine assisted intubation (SAI) versus 65% (19 of 29) success with blind nasotracheal intubation (BNI). Mean time to intubate was 64 seconds and 276 seconds in the SAI and BNI groups, respectively. Eighty-six percent (19 of 22) of patients were intubated successfully in less than 120 seconds in the SAI group versus 37% (10 of 27) in the BNI group (P less than .005). In the SAI group, the mean number of attempts was 1.3 per patient, (range, one to three) with 96% (22 of 23) having two or fewer attempts. No complications were identified. In the BNI group, the mean number of attempts was 3.7 per patient, (range, one to 13) with 45% (13 of 29) having two or fewer attempts (P less than .005). Sixty-nine percent of the BNI group experienced epistaxis, 17% had vomiting, and 10% aspirated. We conclude that SAI is a safe and effective method of airway protection in the obtunded poisoned patient. Complications and difficulty in intubation were significantly less with SAI than with blind nasotracheal intubation.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental data have suggested that pneumatic external counterpressure improves outcome in intra-abdominal hemorrhage by either a tamponade effect and/or elevation in central systemic blood pressure. As a result, the empiric use of the pneumatic antishock garment (PASG) has become a standard of care, even to the point where the device has been legislated as required equipment on emergency medical rescue vehicles. However, the effect of the PASG on intra-abdominal hemorrhage has not been evaluated in randomized clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the PASG on the survival of hypotensive patients with penetrating abdominal injuries. During a 2 1/2-year period, 201 consecutive patients presenting with penetrating anterior abdominal injuries and an initial prehospital systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less were entered into the study. All prehospital care was delivered by the same municipal emergency medical services system, and all patients subsequently were transported to the same regional trauma facility. The patients were randomized into control and pneumatic external counterpressure groups by an alternate-day assignment of PASG use. The resulting study populations (control, n = 104; PASG, n = 97) were found to be well matched for survival probability indices, prehospital response and transport times, and the volume of IV fluids received. The results demonstrated no significant difference in the survival rates of the control and PASG treatment groups (81 of 104 vs 67 of 97). From these data we conclude that, contrary to previous claims, the PASG provides no significant advantage in improving survival in the urban prehospital management of penetrating abdominal injuries.\r"

Atropine, dopamine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol were exposed to a wide range of ionizing radiation. The potency of the four drugs was unaffected by levels of radiation found in ED stretcher areas and high-volume diagnostic radiograph rooms (eg, chest radiograph, computed tomography, fluoroscopy). The potency of atropine may be reduced by gamma radiation in high-use radiotherapy suites. However, dopamine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol were unaffected by high doses of gamma radiation. Atropine, dopamine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol may be safely kept in ED stretcher areas and diagnostic radiology rooms without loss of potency over the shelf life of the drugs.\r"

Since initiation of this program in 1982, students have uniformly praised the combined ACLS/ATLS provider course in anonymous, post-course evaluations. The experience was judged to integrate significantly concepts and principles acquired in students' previous 18 months of clinical training. The opportunity to apply these concepts in unique and challenging clinical simulations was noted by students. Evaluation of pretest and post-test data for the class of 1984 (n = 39) using a t test for matched pairs indicates a significant improvement in post-test examination performance (P less than .001). These data are supported by skills stations testing and achievement of provider certification. Ninety-five percent of student participants achieved provider certification in ACLS; 92% achieved provider certification in ATLS.\r"

Thirty-four family members of cardiac arrest survivors were trained in CPR techniques and defibrillation, and evaluated for performance of skills immediately following training and at six-week and three-month follow-ups. All but two were successfully trained to complete three cycles of CPR interspersed with three defibrillatory shocks in an average of four minutes with the first shock delivered in an average of two minutes. Although there were decrements in the speed and quality of performance at each follow-up period (P less than .01), we conclude that most lay persons can learn to operate an AED safely and under simulated conditions provide defibrillatory shocks an average of eight minutes faster than typical response times of emergency medical technicians. These results suggest that AEDs can be placed in many homes of patients at high risk for cardiac arrest.\r"

We report the results of a program instituted at that time that allowed selected family members to be present during resuscitation efforts. Family members were asked by a chaplain or nurse if they wished to be present in the resuscitation room, and those accepting were accompanied by a supporting emergency staff member who explained the milieu of the code room. None of the participants interfered with resuscitation efforts. Seventy persons who participated were later contacted by one of the chaplains and asked to complete a survey form. Forty-four of 47 respondents (94%) who had been present during resuscitation believed that they would participate again. Thirty-six (76%) thought that adjustment to the death or grieving was facilitated by their witnessing the resuscitation; 30 (64%) felt that their presence was beneficial to the dying family member. We conclude that lay person may wish to be with family members who may be dying even though resuscitation efforts are being made, and that it is reasonable to inquire about this wish. This experience has assisted the grieving process for many and has not interrupted or adversely affected medical efforts at resuscitation.\r"

Subsets were sacrificed periodically in order to establish alterations in growth parameters and lung antioxidant responses. Prolonged exposure to 50% or 65% oxygen did not result in weight loss or changes in lung-to-body weight ratios relative to control values. Treatment with 50% oxygen produced delayed increases in nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) content and catalase (CAT) activity, while treatment with 65% oxygen produced delayed increases in NPSH, CAT, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) content. Rats treated for 6 wk with either 50% or 65% oxygen died significantly earlier than room-air control animals when these groups were subsequently exposed to 100% oxygen. Rats exposed to 80% oxygen had significantly decreased body weight, increased lung-to-body weight ratios, and increased levels of NPSH, CAT, GPx, total superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase by 11 days of treatment. At 6 wk they had significantly altered growth parameters and increased GPx catalase, and NPSH levels. Their final antioxidant profile was not significantly different from 65% oxygen-exposed rats. However, these animals survived significantly longer than any group when exposed to 100% oxygen. In summary, lower concentrations of sublethal hyperoxia (less than or equal to 65%) were capable of eliciting significant antioxidant enzyme responses. Levels of antioxidant enzymes in the lungs of rats chronically exposed to sublethal hyperoxia did not appear to be solely responsible for enhanced survival in subsequent lethal hyperoxia.\r"

Among the potential NTM pathogens, isolates of Mycobacterium avium complex were most frequent, followed by M. kansasii, M. fortuitum, M. scrofulaceum, and M. chelonae. Almost 90% of the isolates were obtained from respiratory specimens. Prevalence rates for NTM disease, as calculated by a diagnostic algorithm, were highest for M. avium complex (1.3/10(5)), M. fortuitum-M. chelonae (0.2/10(5)). The data suggest a changing epidemiologic picture of NTM disease due perhaps to the decreasing incidence of tuberculosis, the increasing prevalence of chronic lung disease, and increased culturing of diagnostic specimens, as well as possibly a change in the ecology of these organisms.\r"

By challenging pulmonary host defenses with various bacterial species as probes, we were able to evaluate clindamycin-phagocyte interaction in vivo. A murine model was developed using an implanted mini-osmotic pump to maintain constant clindamycin blood levels at 1/4 MIC (1 microgram/ml). Mice pretreated for 24 h with clindamycin killed a significantly greater percentage of intratracheally inoculated Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in 4 h than did control animals (37 +/- 2% versus 7 +/- 5%). The enhancing effects of clindamycin on pulmonary defenses could not be duplicated by a 1-h preincubation of B. theta in 1/4 MIC of clindamycin before inoculation into untreated mice. Clindamycin blood levels of 1 microgram/ml did not alter the rate at which Pseudomonas aeruginosa (clindamycin-resistant) was killed by pulmonary defenses, suggesting that clindamycin did not cause nonspecific activation of phagocytic defenses. Both PMNs and alveolar macrophages lavaged from the lungs of clindamycin-treated mice contained bioassayable concentrated intracellular antibiotic. The presence of intracellular antibiotic was further supported by experiments in which the intrapulmonary killing of large numbers of Staphylococcus aureus (sensitive, but not resistant organisms) was significantly enhanced (89 +/- 5 versus 70 +/- 5%) by clindamycin pretreatment. In contrast, phagocytes lavaged from mice with constant 1/4 MIC (4 micrograms/ml) blood levels of penicillin G had no detectable intracellular antibiotic activity and did not augment the intrapulmonary killing of B. theta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Relative to control PMNL, the PMNL from smokers were hyperreactive to FMLP stimulation with increased generation of both extracellular (p less than 0.025) and intracellular (p less than 0.025) reactive oxidants. Smokers' PMNL also showed increased PMNL-activated superoxide generation and increased apparent receptors for FMLP. The water-soluble antioxidants ascorbate and cysteine (2.5 X 10(-5) M to 2.5 X 10(-4) M) selectively neutralized the extracellular activity of PMNL-derived reactive oxidants. The lipid-soluble antioxidant dapsone (1.25 to 30 micrograms/ml), on the other hand, inhibited both the extracellular and intracellular FMLP-activated chemiluminescence responses in PMNL from smokers and nonsmoking control subjects. Regulation of the increased extracellular and intracellular membrane-associated oxidative responses in PMNL from cigarette smokers is probably an important function of water-soluble and lipid-soluble antioxidants in vivo.\r"

Osmotic release differs significantly from IgE-dependent activation and may be important in the pathophysiology of anaphylactoid reactions during intravenous infusions of hyperosmolar radiocontrast dyes and of obstructive attacks suffered by asthmatics after exercise. To confirm reported differences in osmotic activation of basophils and lung mast cells, the process was compared systematically in the 2 cell types. Both cells were activated by hyperosmolar mannitol, glucose, sucrose, and NaCl, but histamine release from basophils rose sharply to a maximum at 1,050 mOsm/kg, whereas mast cells released maximally at 700 to 750 mOsm/kg. Release was partially Ca2+-dependent in basophils but was highly Ca2+-dependent in mast cells. Release in mast cells was rapid and essentially complete by 5 min, whereas 45 to 60 min were required in basophils. The temperature optimum in both cell types was 32 degrees C, and release in both was enhanced by drugs that increase intracellular cAMP (PGE2, IBMX, and db cAMP). We conclude that osmotic activation of basophils and mast cells is a nontoxic process that differs significantly from IgE-dependent histamine release. If it does indeed participate in the pathophysiology of human disease, different treatment strategies will be required to modulate this contribution.\r"

Patients were randomized to a fed group or to a control group. Patients in the fed group were provided with an enteral formula in addition to their usual diet. Daily calorie and protein intake and weekly anthropometric measures were made. Pulmonary function tests were measured on Weeks 1, 4, and 8. Respiratory muscle strength was measured by means of maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP), (MEP), and respiratory muscle endurance was measured by the maximal sustained ventilatory capacity (MSVC). The mean weight of the fed group increased from 52.2 +/- 6.4 to 53.3 +/- 6.9 kg (NS). The mean daily caloric intake of the fed group was significantly increased during the study (p less than 0.02). The mean calorie intake during the study of the fed group was 174 +/- 17% of the estimated basal energy expenditure. During the study period, no change was observed in anthropometric measures, pulmonary function studies, or RMF. Because patients tend to decrease their own food intake while receiving enteral formulas, it is difficult to provide sufficient calories and protein needed to effect changes in nutritional status and RMF in an outpatient COPD population. In addition, we compared RMF in 12 poorly nourished male patients (87.6 +/- 6.1% of ideal body weight) and 13 well-nourished male patients with severe COPD. Both groups had comparable degrees of air-flow limitation and hyperinflation. No difference was noted between the groups in either MIP, MEP, or MSVC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Outcomes included twice-daily recordings of peak flow rates, spirometry, the distance patients could walk in 6 min, and clinical symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and emotional function. Clinically important and statistically significant differences between the 4 periods were noted on both physiologic and functional outcomes. For the group as a whole, improvement with inhaled salbutamol and orally administered theophylline was comparable, and additional benefit was gained from a combination of the 2 drugs.

There was no significant difference in FRC between normal controls (n = 36) and CF infants (190 +/- 69 versus 186 +/- 63 ml; p less than 0.8), although the CF group had a higher RR (32 +/- 7 versus 37 +/- 7 BPM; p less than 0.05) and a lower MI (45 +/- 7 versus 40 +/- 8%; p less than 0.05), reflecting an abnormal distribution of ventilation. The lower Crs (9.0 +/- 3.4 versus 5.7 +/- 2.8 ml/cm H2O; p less than 0.01) and the lower specific compliance, Crs/FRC (0.049 +/- 0.013 versus 0.029 +/- 0.007 1/cm H2O; p less than 0.0001), in the CF group were the parameters that best distinguished the normal control and CF infants.

However, at work rates associated with increased blood lactate, i.e., above the lactate threshold (LT), VO2 continues to increase slowly beyond 3 min; this delays or precludes steady state. We therefore correlated the characteristics of this slow phase of the VO2 kinetics with the increase in blood lactate during 6 randomized, constant-load cycle exercise tests in 6 normal men. One test was below and the others were at various levels above our gas exchange estimate of LT. The slow kinetic phase of VO2, characterized as the increase between the third and the sixth minute of exercise [delta VO2 (6-3)] or the third minute and termination of exercise [delta VO2 (term-3)], was linearly correlated with the blood lactate increase. The VO2 at termination of a given work rate above LT was greater than predicted from the sub-LT VO2 versus work-rate relationship. Work rates less than approximately 50% of the difference between VO2max and LT resulted in lactate and VO2 curves that reached recognizable asymptotes. At the higher work rates, both the lactate and VO2 curves continued to rise to the point of fatigue. We conclude that positive values for delta VO2 (6-3) and delta VO2(term-3) during constant-load exercise only occur at work rates above the LT, and the magnitudes of which are highly correlated with the increase in blood lactate.\r"

Under basal conditions, patients showed mild reductions from normal in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, normal PaO2 (mean, 92.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg), mild hypocapnia (mean, 34 +/- 0.7 mm Hg), and a slightly right-shifted oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (P50, 27.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg; 2,3-DPG, 13.1 +/- 0.6 mumol/g). Using the multiple insert gas elimination technique, we found mild to moderate ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) inequality with a mean of 5% (range, 0 to 20%) of cardiac output (QT) perfusing low VA/Q ratio (less than 0.1) areas but no shunt. Breathing 11% O2, there were significant increases in QT, pulmonary artery pressure, and vascular resistance, whereas no changes occurred in VA/Q distribution, and there was no evidence for alveolar-endcapillary diffusion limitation for O2. In contrast, after 100% O2 shunt developed and VA/Q relationships worsened without significant hemodynamic changes. Furthermore, patients with cutaneous spider nevi (n = 8) showed more hepatocellular dysfunction (lower prothrombin values), lower systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, less hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), lower PaO2, and more VA/Q mismatch than did those without spiders. Our results confirm, therefore, that HPV is not fully abolished, as previously described, in hepatic cirrhosis. However, those patients with more advanced hepatic disease exhibit inadequate pulmonary vascular tone, which increases VA/Q inequality and lowers PaO2.\r"

The short-term effects of NH3 vapor on mucociliary function in the in the maxillary sinus of rabbits anesthetized with urethane were investigated by a photoelectric technique. Challenges with 1.5 ml NH3 increased mucociliary activity dose-dependently, the maximal response being 26.6 +/- 1.6%. The increase appeared within 1.3 +/- 0.3 s after exposure. Atropine and hexamethonium decreased the effect of NH3, indicating that part of the response was mediated by cholinergic effector neurons, but a noncholinergic effect clearly remained. Pretreatment with large doses of capsaicin (13 mg i.a.) abolished the response, whereas the SP antagonist (D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9) SP inhibited the noncholinergic response. Challenges with NH3 vapor also decreased the respiratory rate. An identical response was noticed during injections with the C fiber stimulant capsaicin. Together these results indicate that NH3 vapor triggers a mucociliary protective reflex in the airways, involving capsaicin-sensitive C fibers. The recorded increase of mucociliary activity is probably due to the combined effect on the mucociliary system of both SP and acetylcholine released from the afferent and efferent part of the reflex arc, respectively.\r"

An antiserum raised against the low molecular weight protein fraction from TA surfactant recognized the 6,000-dalton bovine and human proteins in addition to protein bands at 14,000 and 18,000 daltons.

Three major bacterial collagenase-sensitive chains were synthesized and secreted into the medium between 12 and 36 h of culture. Two of the chains comigrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with radiolabeled type IV procollagen (PC) chains isolated from adult rat lung (Mr = 185,000 and 170,000 after reduction) and were coprecipitated with monospecific antibodies to type IV collagen. Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptide maps of the chromatographically purified chains were identical to maps of rat lung type IV PC, and confirmed the identity of these chains as pro alpha 1(IV) and pro alpha 2(IV). Type IV PC was the major high molecular weight collagen in the cell layer, and a fraction of the newly synthesized type IV PC was selectively deposited on the substratum together with newly synthesized fibronectin. Type II cells also secreted a low molecular weight, non-disulfide-bonded, collagenase-sensitive protein (Mr = 19,000, collagen standards; Mr = 26,000, globular standards). The protein coeluted with type IV PC from DEAE-cellulose but was resolved from native type IV on CM-cellulose. The protein was not precipitated with polyclonal antibodies to type IV collagen or rat surfactant apoprotein. These studies further demonstrate the heterogeneity of collagenous macro-molecules synthesized by lung epithelial cells in vitro. We suggest that interactions between pneumocyte-derived fibronectin and type IV procollagen contribute to the formation of the epithelial basement membrane and to the attachment of these cells in normal or injured lung.\r"

We used inhaled aerosolized 99mTc-labeled diethylene triamine pentacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) to investigate whether human respiratory epithelial permeability is similarly affected by exposure to ozone. In a randomized, crossover double-blinded study, 8 healthy, nonsmoking young men were exposed for 2 h to purified air and 0.4 ppm ozone while performing intermittent high intensity treadmill exercise (minute ventilation = 66.8 L/min). SRaw and FVC were measured before and at the end of exposures. Seventy-five minutes after the exposures, the pulmonary clearance of 99mTc-DTPA was measured by sequential posterior lung imaging with a computer-assisted gamma camera. Ozone exposure caused respiratory symptoms in all 8 subjects and was associated with a 14 +/- 2.8% (mean +/- SEM) decrement in FVC (p less than 0.001) and a 71 +/- 22% increase in SRaw (p = 0.04). Compared with the air exposure day, 7 of the 8 subjects showed increased 99mTc-DTPA clearance after the ozone exposure, with the mean value increasing from 0.59 +/- 0.08 to 1.75 +/- 0.43%/min (p = 0.03). These data show that ozone exposure sufficient to produce decrements in the pulmonary function of human subjects also causes an increase in 99mTc-DTPA clearance.\r"

Their causes and evaluation are useful in demonstrating that medicine has a potentially destructive side as well as a highly constructive one. In the 1960s, the ATS left the sanitoria and joined the mainstream of medicine. In the 1980s it has become apparent that formal connections with science are not enough to ensure maximal safety for our patients. Nor are these connections sufficient to ensure maximal effectiveness of the measures we use to treat patients. A new awareness of our collective responsibility for improved patient outcome would be the obvious first step. Translating this sense of responsibility into new organizational approaches could place the ATS at the forefront of providing needed, and perhaps inevitable, reforms of medicine generally.\r"

Controls and Group D did not differ in body or lung weight, DNA, protein, or lung volume (VL), but Group D lungs contained more lavageable and tissue surfactant, total alveolar surface area (Sa), and membrane diffusing capacity (DmO2) because of increased alveolar surface density. The S neonates weighed 38% less than controls, with proportional reductions in lung weight, DNA, protein, lavage and tissue phospholipids, VL, Sa septal tissue, capillary surface area (Sc), and DmO2. Compared with these S neonates, the SD neonates did not differ for BW, lung weight, DNA, protein, phospholipids, or VL, but their lungs contained significantly more Sa, Sc, epithelial and endothelial tissue volumes, and a higher alveolar surface density. These differences resulted in an average DmO2 for SD neonates that was indistinguishable from that of controls, and correlated with greater viability among the smallest SD animals compared with those in Group S.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined the possibility that endogenously produced growth factors might contribute to these fibrotic changes through stimulation of fibroblast replication, with a resulting increase in collagen synthesis. We cultured fibroblasts from the lungs of prematurely delivered baboons and adult hamsters exposed to 100% oxygen and tested the media from these cells to see if they produced a factor(s) that was mitogenic to normal fibroblasts. We found that lung fibroblasts from baboons delivered prematurely at 140 days of gestation and ventilated for 6 days with 100% oxygen produced a factor(s) that supported fibroblast growth. A similar factor was also secreted by fibroblasts from normal term newborn baboon lungs and from the lungs of adult hamsters exposed to 100% oxygen for 4 to 8 days. Growth factor was not secreted by lung fibroblasts from 140-day non-breathing or 24-h-ventilated premature baboons, adult baboons, or hamsters not exposed oxygen. The growth-promoting substance is apparently a progression factor that is heat labile and inactivated by exposure to trypsin. These findings indicate that exposure of both the premature and adult lung to high concentrations of oxygen causes the elaboration of a growth factor that may induce fibroblast hyperplasia. This action may result in an increased production of connective tissue proteins and thereby contribute to the development of the fibrosis seen in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\r"

Diagnostic and treatment delays are common, and controversy continues regarding approaches to surgical intervention. Overall survival has increased with improved adjunctive modalities; however, morbidity and mortality remain high. A total of 115 consecutive cases of nonmalignant esophageal perforation were reviewed. There were 69 thoracic, 27 cervical, and 19 abdominal perforations. Etiology of the perforations was iatrogenic in 65 patients, traumatic in 28, and spontaneous perforation in 22. Symptoms included pain (71%), fever (51%), dyspnea (24%), and crepitus (22%). Contrast roentgenography was used in 78 patients and demonstrated the perforation in all but two patients. All but 20 patients had operations. In the last decade, the survival rate was 11.4 per cent for patients treated within 24 hours of perforation. Survival significantly improved in the last 10 years because of hyperalimentation, cardiopulmonary monitoring, and better antibiotic coverage. Treatment of choice is primary closure with drainage, regardless of the duration of the perforation. In selected patients who have cervical esophageal perforation, nonoperative management has a role.\r"

  ".W": "During the last 12 years, 20 patients with significant airway injuries have been treated for lesions involving the trachea, larynx, and/or bronchus. Fourteen of the injuries were the result of penetrating wounds, nine gunshot wounds, and five stab wounds. Six patients presented with blunt trauma, four as a result of motor vehicle accidents, one from a clothesline injury, and one from a crush injury. Sixteen of the 20 were males; average age was 29.6 years. Eleven patients had injuries involving only the trachea, six had isolated laryngeal injuries, two had bronchial injuries, and one patient had a combined injury of the trachea and larynx. Eleven had subcutaneous emphysema, four had hemoptysis, and three stable patients experienced sudden respiratory arrest while being evaluated for the repair of their injuries. Twelve patients required immediate intubation or tracheostomy. Most airway injuries were closed primarily. In one instance segmental resection of a perforated trachea and primary anastomosis was necessary. Two patients died after proper management of the airway injury. One died of an associated brain stem injury and the other of profuse hemorrhage from a liver injury. Of the 18 surviving patients, all but two recovered totally without residual impairment. Described here is a protocol for the evaluation and immediate treatment of airway injuries that is consistent with the guidelines of the Subcommittee of Advanced Trauma Life Support of the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma. Aggressive initial management, high index of suspicion for injury, and meticulous repair of the injured airway are equally important steps in the successful management of these patients.\r"

Vascular trauma combined with orthopedic trauma was also identified in four other cases--two disruptions of the pubic symphysis and two dislocations of the knee without fracture. Nine (43%) of the 21 involved limbs were eventually amputated. Limb survival was not related to the temporal relationship of vessel repair to skeletal stabilization; the presence or absence of shock on admission; the presence of associated but repaired venous injury; or the presence of unrelated injuries. Limb survival was related to the interval from injury to arrival in the operating room; the level of arterial injury; and the quantitative degree of muscle, bone, and skin injury. By combining these variables a limb salvage index was established that identified lower extremities likely to require amputation after combined orthopedic and vascular trauma (sensitivity 78%, specificity 100%). Use of this predictive salvage index may prevent the trauma surgeon from attempting to salvage a doomed or useless lower extremity and may thus permit early prosthetic rehabilitation to follow definitive primary amputation.\r"

The severity of injury to the colon and other abdominal organs was quantified in each patient by the Colon Injury Score (CIS) and the Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index (PATI). Sixty-five patients (72%) were managed definitively, i.e., by primary repair (46 patients) and by resection-ileocolic anastomosis (19 patients). There was no morbidity related to the colonic repair in these patients. Exteriorized repair was used selectively in eight patients and was successful in six (75%). Thirteen patients underwent loop colostomy and the mean CIS and PATI in this group were comparable to those in primary repair and exteriorized repair groups. Resection colostomy was performed in four patients with extensive colon and associated organ trauma (high CIS, PATI). The overall incidence of intra-abdominal abscess was 2.2 per cent (2 of 90 patients). The mortality was 4.4 per cent (4 of 90 patients) and none of the deaths was related to the management of the colon trauma. It is concluded that the majority of patients with penetrating right colon trauma can be treated effectively by primary repair or resection anastomosis. Exteriorized repair should be the preferred method whenever loop colostomy is considered. Colostomy should be used selectively in unstable patients who require colon resection.\r"

Blunt trauma was caused by vehicular accidents in seven patients and crush injuries in two. Penetrating rectal trauma was due to gunshot wounds in ten patients and foreign body insertion in six. All patients with blunt injury had bright red rectal bleeding, which led to diagnostic sigmoidoscopy. Rectal injury was identified at sigmoidoscopy in 12 patients who had penetrating wounds and at laparotomy in four patients. Thirteen patients who had penetrating rectal trauma had injury to only the rectum or to one additional organ. In contrast, all patients who had blunt rectal trauma had at least three associated injuries. In the penetrating group, 13 patients were treated by colostomy and mucus fistula; three patients with mucosal injury were managed nonoperatively. The only death occurred in a patient whose rectal injury was initially missed. Patients who had blunt rectal trauma were managed with colostomy and mucus fistula. Three patients died postoperatively, two of pelvic bleeding and one of head injury. Hemodynamic stabilization, colostomy and mucus fistula, presacral drainage, and rectal washout constitute proper treatment of patients with blunt or penetrating rectal trauma. Because of the greater number and severity of associated injuries, morbidity and mortality are higher after blunt rectal trauma.\r"

Since 1980 our institution has followed a policy of mandatory celiotomy for back and flank wounds with evidence of fascial penetration. Following this policy, 34 patients underwent celiotomy for back (8), flank (22), or combined (4) area penetrating injuries. Four patients sustained shotgun blasts, eight sustained handgun or rifle injuries, and 22 patients were stabbed. All shotgun blasts caused multiple intra-abdominal injuries and five (63%) of the eight gunshot victims had significant intra-abdominal injuries. Only one (5%) of the 22 stab victims had significant intra-abdominal injury. Four (12%) patients died, three of shotgun injuries. One patient had a small bowel obstruction 1 month after a noncontributory abdominal examination. Based on this review, the authors recommend selective management of stab wounds to the back and flank. Gunshot wounds continue to warrant mandatory exploration.\r"

A MSBOS specifies, and thus limits, the amount of blood normally crossmatched for elective surgical procedures. During the first 10 months after introducing MSBOS at our hospital, there was a 33 per cent drop in the number of units of blood crossmatched for elective surgical procedures. The 712 crossmatches that were avoided saved the hospital blood bank more than $6000. Patient care was not adversely affected. Institution of MSBOS can be accomplished without difficulty by gaining input from surgeons and anesthesiologists. After implementation, follow-up is advisable to attain optimal blood use.\r"

The birth weights of these infants ranged from 600 to 4350 grams; nearly 75 per cent weighed less than 1500 grams. The etiology of the pneumoperitoneum and the hospital survival were reviewed. All operative patients had exploratory surgery through an upper abdominal transverse incision extending across both rectus muscles. All gastric and duodenal perforations were closed primarily; the perforations in the remaining gastrointestinal tract were generally exteriorized through the lateral edge of the wound. The single leading cause of pneumoperitoneum in the newborn is necrotizing enterocolitis, accounting for 60 per cent of the patients in this series; 78 per cent of these infants survived. All infants with (\"spontaneous\") ileal perforations survived. The two patients with colon perforations (from meconium plug obstruction) died, one of congenital heart disease associated with Down's syndrome and the other of hyaline membrane disease. One patient who had mild hyaline membrane disease, who was not ventilated, and who did not have mediastinal emphysema also had pneumoperitoneum for which no cause was found at laparotomy (\"spontaneous\"). He survived. In six critically ill infants (11% of the series) pneumoperitoneum developed secondary to mediastinal dissection of air from ventilators. None of these infants was operated on because an intestinal perforation as a source of the pneumoperitoneum could reliably be excluded by the presence of pneumomediastinum and/or a negative paracentesis. This group of infants warrants special attention, because in them \"negative\" laparotomies performed in search of an intestinal perforation would certainly compromise their already precarious conditions.\r"

Infants with PVG were compared with those without PVG with respect to clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome. There was no significant difference between the two groups in birth weight, Apgar scores, or the age of onset of NEC. All patients received standard medical therapy unless they developed pneumoperitoneum, had a positive paracentesis, or deteriorated in spite of maximal medical treatment, in which case they had surgery. Of 97 infants with \"definite\" NEC, 55 (56%) required surgery. Twenty-one patients (22% of the total) had PVG and 17 (81%) of them required surgery. Seventy-six patients (78% of total) did not have PVG and only 38 (50%) of them required surgery (P = 0.011). Five (29%) of 17 infants with PVG had nearly total intestinal necrosis compared with only five (13%, P = 0.25) of 38 infants without PVG. Patients with PVG had a lower overall survival rate (62% vs 88%, P = 0.009), medical survival rate (75% vs 97%, P = 0.184), and surgical survival rate (59% vs 79%, P = 0.19) than patients without PVG. Infants weighing less than 1000 grams fared worse regardless of the presence or absence of PVG. Portal vein gas is an ominous prognostic sign. It signals a greater likelihood for surgical intervention, a more extensive bowel involvement, and a significantly lower survival when compared to patients with NEC who do not have PVG.\r"

  ".W": "In 151 years since first described, there have been 112 reported cases of hernia through the foramen of Winslow (HFW). All thus far have described HFW as a primary entity. The case reported appears to be unique with HFW as a surgical complication. HFW is the least common of internal hernias. The primary symptom is pain referred from the herniated organ and the hepatoduodenal ligament. An interesting sign is that the patient is found curled up or stooped over for pain relief. Anatomic factors implicated in HFW are an enlarged epiploic foramen, a floppy cecum and ascending colon, or abnormal length of small bowel mesentery. Tension on these structures causes pain with the torso extended. Distention of bowel in the lesser sac mimics gastric obstruction. Organs herniated are: small bowel (63%); cecum, ascending colon, and terminal ileum (30%); and transverse colon (7%). Of 25 cases reported since 1966, cecal herniation comprised two-thirds. The diagnosis may be made radiologically and the treatment is surgical. The case and a review of the literature are presented with attention to the anatomy. Also provided are the signs and symptoms of this interesting and perplexing diagnosis.\r"

If the functional demands of an anastomosis are not imposed, the circulation of such segments will often be restored, and they will withstand successful anastomosis a few days later. If circulation fails to improve or deteriorates, prompt resection and possibly reexteriorization can be done without delay. Intestinal absorptive surface, crucial to subsequent survival may thus be saved.\r"

More proximally located joints have more complex movements and are controlled by more spinal cord levels than more distal joints with simpler movements. More proximally located joints are also controlled by more cranially located groups of spinal cord levels while more distal ones are innervated by more caudally located groups. Algorithms are presented that summarize these principles in the form of two simple, concise charts and a stick figure. The cord levels given by the algorithms for the innervation of any particular muscle are in good general agreement with recognized authorities. In addition, these algorithms are easily learned and readily applied to clinical problems by placing the patient in the position assumed when playing the piano or operating an automobile. In this posture, the most cranial two spinal cord levels of a group controlling a joint are responsible for \"upward\" motion of that joint and the most caudal two or three control \"downward\" motion thereof.\r"

  ".W": "Sensory impairment in the saphenous nerve distribution after stripping of the long saphenous vein was studied in 14 patients undergoing bilateral vein stripping for symptomatic varicose veins. The vein was stripped upward in one leg and downward in the other to determine whether the direction in which the vein is stripped contributes to the incidence of such sensory impairment. Sensory evaluations at 12 weeks postoperatively revealed that ten of the 14 legs in the group that had the veins stripped upward demonstrated significant objective sensory deficits (P less than 0.001) compared with those that had the veins stripped downward (zero of 14). At 6 months the results were similar. To obtain anatomic correlation with the clinical findings, ten fresh cadaver dissections were carried out. In four of five legs in which the vein was stripped in an upward direction, the pretibial branch was avulsed off the main trunk and in two of five, the infrapatellar branch was avulsed. Such nerve avulsions did not occur on downward stripping. We recommend that the long saphenous vein be stripped downward to avoid sensory impairment in the saphenous nerve distribution.\r"

Prompt intervention by dissolution or bypassing the thrombi could reduce the severity of the effects. Here, the anatomic pathways facilitating a bypass are explored. Four possible arteries, the two superficial temporals, left and right, and two middle meningeals, left and right, are in positions adjacent to branches of the middle cerebral arteries, the trunks of which are located in the lateral fissures of the brain. The first possibility is anastomosing a branch of the superficial temporal artery with the middle cerebral artery segment in the lateral fissure where this segment is usually clear of thrombi. The second possibility is anastomosing a branch of the middle meningeal artery with the postthrombotic segment of the middle cerebral artery. These anastomoses are to be done with donor and recipient arteries of the same side. In the unlikely event that these two possibilities are lost, it is still possible to anastomose the affected middle cerebral artery with the superficial temporal or middle meningeal artery of the opposite side using several inches of saphenous vein.\r"

There were 73 male and 12 female patients with a mean age of 34 years. The mechanism of injury was blunt trauma in 51 and penetrating trauma in 34. The incidence of associated intraabdominal injury was 31 per cent and 79 per cent in blunt and penetrating trauma, respectively. Splenectomy was performed in 43 (51%) and splenorrhaphy in 42 (49%). Splenorrhaphy was performed in 19 (37%) who had blunt trauma and 23 (67%) who had penetrating trauma (P less than 0.01). Overall six patients died, three in the splenorrhaphy group (7.1%). Only one patient who had splenorrhaphy required reoperation for splenic hemorrhage. The authors conclude that about 50 per cent of all injured spleens in the patient population studied can be salvaged during laparotomy for splenic trauma, the splenic salvage rate is higher in penetrating trauma, and splenorrhaphy is a safe operation.\r"

An increasing incidence of gunshot wounds and a greater frequency of patients presenting in extremis was noted in the latter years of the study as compared with the earlier period. Our data indicate that there is an increasing need for emergency room thoracotomy in the management of cardiac injuries.

Malignant neoplasm was diagnosed in 284 instances, benign disease in 22. In 176 patients with malignant tumors, the diagnosis was based on FNAB exclusively. In 108 patients who were operated on, the results of FNAB matched histology in 97 per cent. The aspiration specimen was inadequate in 36 patients, most of whom had diffuse lung disease. The incidence of complications was extremely low. FNAB is safe and reliable. It is recommended for use in clinical workup of undiagnosed pulmonary masses. FNAB enables rational planning of treatment when other diagnostic methods fail. The authors do not recommend FNAB for use in cases of diffuse pulmonary disease.\r"

A review of the literature reveals only 24 cases of splenic abscess secondary to this particular etiology. The authors report five patients with intravenous drug addiction who underwent splenectomy for pyogenic splenic abscess within 1 year. Fever and abdominal pain were the only constant physical signs. Three patients had associated infective endocarditis, and the other two patients sustained blunt trauma to the left side of the trunk weeks earlier. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound were diagnostic in all five patients preoperatively, and they were complementary when combined. Four of the five patients had Staphylococcus aureus septicemia at the time of splenectomy. Three patients recovered from their operations, and the other two, both with endocarditis, died postoperatively from causes unrelated to splenic abscess and splenectomy. A high index of suspicion is warranted in this susceptible group of patients with vague abdominal signs and persistent sepsis to rule out splenic suppuration. The noninvasive imaging methods, CT scan and ultrasound, facilitate early diagnosis in these patients.\r"

A total or a subtotal thyroidectomy was performed in four and five patients, respectively, associated with a modified neck dissection in six patients with involved cervical lymph nodules. An underlying pheochromocytoma of the left adrenal was excised in one patient prior to thyroidectomy. In all cases the parathyroid glands were identified, and in two cases of familial MTC, in which they were grossly enlarged, the parathyroid glands were removed. Four patients died as a result of their disease within 3 years, whereas patients are well 4 to 12 years after surgery. The best chance of cure lies in early diagnosis and an aggressive surgical removal of the primary tumor and any cervical metastases.\r"

After detailed preadmission assessment, all patients received pretreatment assurances that their religious beliefs would be respected, regardless of the circumstances in the operating room. There were no untoward effects of this policy. Whereas the religious and legal aspects of the issue may be confusing and unacceptable to some surgeons, those undertaking to treat such patients must use ancillary means, technical variations, and alternatives to standard procedures in order to minimize risks and achieve acceptable results. Preoperative agreement should be viewed as binding by the surgeon and should be adhered to regardless of events developing during and after operation. Such an approach constitutes the best preoperative preparation, orients the patients positively toward their surgical treatment, and diverts the surgeon's attention from the legal and philosophical considerations to the surgical and technical ones, thus, allowing him to perform optimally and serve his patient's best interests. The recovery phase in this small series of electively performed operations occurred at anticipated rates and no postoperative complications developed.\r"

The population was randomly divided into two equal-sized groups and the Cox regression model was used in one to form a treadmill score that was then validated in the other group. The final treadmill score was calculated as follows: exercise time--(5 X ST deviation)--(4 X treadmill angina index). Using this treadmill score, 13% of the patients were found to be at high risk; 53%, at moderate risk; and 34%, at low risk. The treadmill score added independent prognostic information to that provided by clinical data, coronary anatomy, and left ventricular ejection fraction: patients with three-vessel disease with a score of -11 or less had a 5-year survival rate of 67%, and those with a score of +7 or more had a 5-year survival rate of 93%. The treadmill score was useful for stratifying prognosis in patients with suspected coronary artery disease who were referred to us for catheterization, and may provide a useful adjunct to clinical decision making in the larger population of patients being evaluated for chest pain.\r"

Aortic root dilatation was the only apparent cause in 31 patients (30%), exceeding in prevalence any valvular cause, and was independently associated only with older age (p less than 0.001). Echocardiography showed dilatation to be either localized to the sinuses of Valsalva or to be generalized. At initial evaluation, patients with generalized dilatation had severer abnormalities of left ventricular size and function than those with localized or no dilatation. Aortic valves were subsequently replaced in more patients with generalized than localized dilatation during 28 +/- 17 month follow-up (9 of 15 patients compared with 2 of 15, p less than 0.03). Thus, idiopathic aortic root dilatation is the commonest definable cause of severe aortic regurgitation; aortic root dilatation is associated independently with age but not blood pressure; and generalized aortic root dilatation is associated with marked ventricular dilatation, hypertrophy, and dysfunction.\r"

Final diagnoses were pneumonia in 38% of the patients, trivial illness (viral syndrome, pharyngitis, or pyrogen reaction) in 26%, infective endocarditis in 13%, and other conditions in 23%. Neither emergency room physicians' diagnostic predictions nor clinical data correlated with a final diagnosis of endocarditis. Although physicians' prediction of trivial illness was associated with a final diagnosis of trivial illness (p less than 0.05), 29% of these patients had a more serious final diagnosis. These data confirm the need to hospitalize all intravenous drug abusers presenting with fever at an emergency room.\r"

To assess recent mortality rates, we reviewed the course of acute cholecystitis in patients hospitalized between 1960 and 1981 at one hospital. Death occurred in 3 of 46 patients with diabetes and in 7 of 263 patients without the disease (p = 0.55). The age-adjusted estimate of the relative risk for death was 2.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 9.4) for diabetic compared with nondiabetic patients. All 3 diabetic patients who died had been diagnosed as having diabetes within 5 years of death, and only one had been taking insulin. Patients who had elevated blood urea nitrogen levels (greater than 20 mg/dL) were found to have an increased mortality rate when compared with patients with normal levels (27% compared with 2%; p less than 0.001). Results were similar for the outcome of serious complications. These results suggest the need for reconsideration of the recommendation for prophylactic cholecystectomy in diabetic patients with silent gallstones.\r"

Notably, a large proportion of nursing home patients are at high risk for morbid and mortal events yet are incapable of expressing medical management preferences due to dementia and confusion. Policies and procedures regarding medical decisions for nursing home patients are needed. We present and discuss a policy for patient care in nursing homes based on recommendations of a national biomedical ethics committee. This policy, which may be adapted for use in specific institutions, explicitly discusses the principles of care and their application in nursing homes. It also encourages prospective decision making and provides advance care directives for patients making and provides advance care directives for patients and their decision-making surrogates to do so.\r"

However, in the last few years there has been increased interest in serum IgA, in factors that regulate the various forms of IgA produced, and in the relationship between serum and mucosal IgA. Recent data indicate that in humans, the mucosal surfaces are neither the source nor the destination of serum IgA. By estimating the amounts of IgA produced at various sites throughout the body, we have shown that in humans more IgA is synthesized and secreted each day than IgG and IgM combined; about one third of this IgA is secreted directly into the vascular compartment and never reaches the mucosal surfaces. We also consider a possible role for serum IgA as the \"discreet housekeeper,\" the relationship between cells that produce IgA in the serum and IgA in secretions, and factors that influence the various forms of IgA produced.\r"
