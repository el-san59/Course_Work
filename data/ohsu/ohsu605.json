The etiologic factors must be categorized as neoplastic, infectious, inflammatory, vascular, and hematologic, among others. Unfortunately, these lesions are not easily accessible for sampling, and all other diagnostic methods must first be exhausted. This case report describes a patient who was brought to an emergency department in New Jersey after her first seizure. The diagnosis was cerebral cysticercosis, an intracerebral parasitic infection that is extremely rare in this area but very common in other areas of the world. As more and more people immigrate to the United States, researchers believe that cerebral cysticercosis will become more common. It is imperative, therefore, for primary care physicians to understand this disease and to consider it in the appropriate setting.\r"

  ".W": "Uroporphyrinogen III synthase [URO-synthase; hydroxymethylbilane hydro-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.2.1.75], the fourth enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, is responsible for conversion of the linear tetrapyrrole, hydroxymethylbilane, to the cyclic tetrapyrrole, uroporphyrinogen III. The deficient activity of URO-synthase is the enzymatic defect in the autosomal recessive disorder congenital erythropoietic porphyria. To facilitate the isolation of a full-length cDNA for human URO-synthase, the human erythrocyte enzyme was purified to homogeneity and 81 nonoverlapping amino acids were determined by microsequencing the N terminus and four tryptic peptides. Two synthetic oligonucleotide mixtures were used to screen 1.2 x 10(6) recombinants from a human adult liver cDNA library. Eight clones were positive with both oligonucleotide mixtures. Of these, dideoxy sequencing of the 1.3 kilobase insert from clone pUROS-2 revealed 5' and 3' untranslated sequences of 196 and 284 base pairs, respectively, and an open reading frame of 798 base pairs encoding a protein of 265 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 28,607 Da. The authenticity of this clone was established by colinearity of the predicted amino acid sequence with 81 microsequenced residues from the purified enzyme. In addition, high levels of enzymatic activity and immunoreactive protein were expressed when a blunt-ended 971-base-pair Ava II cDNA fragment containing the entire coding region was inserted into vectors for expression in Escherichia coli. The isolation and expression of this full-length cDNA for human URO-synthase should facilitate studies of the structure, organization, and chromosomal localization of this heme biosynthetic gene as well as the characterization of the molecular lesions causing congenital erythropoietic porphyria.\r"

By employing chromatin as a template in a partially purified pol III transcription system, we now demonstrate that the augmented expression results from the formation of pol III transcription complexes on previously inactive B2 genes. Extracts prepared from normal growing cells and transformed cells transcribed cloned pol III templates 5-fold more efficiently than extracts from normal confluent cells. This increase was attributed to 5-fold greater levels of factor IIIC; the levels of pol III and factor IIIB were the same in all extracts. We discuss how the levels of IIIC and differing accessibility of this factor to repressed B2 genes mediate the formation of pol III transcription complexes in normal growing and transformed cells.\r"

Replicative synthesis was substantially more accurate than synthesis by the human DNA polymerase alpha-DNA primase complex purified from HeLa cell extracts by immunoaffinity chromatography, suggesting that additional factors or activities in the extract may increase fidelity during bidirectional replication. However, by using a sensitive opal codon reversion assay, single-base substitution errors were readily detected in the replication products at frequencies significantly higher than estimated spontaneous mutation rates in vivo. These data suggest that additional fidelity factors may be present during chromosomal replication in vivo and/or that the fidelity of replication alone does not account for the low spontaneous mutation rates in eukaryotes.\r"

Polypeptides that bind bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) to form the light-harvesting I (LH-I) and reaction-center (RC) complexes are encoded by a single transcriptional unit termed the puf operon. In this investigation we demonstrate that the first structural gene in the puf operon (pufQ) of Rhodobacter capsulatus encodes a protein that is required for BChl biosynthesis and that there exists a linear relationship between the amount of pufQ expression and the level of BChl synthesis. Protein sequence similarity exists between PufQ and the region of RC polypeptides that are known to bind BChl and quinone. These observations suggest that pufQ may regulate BChl biosynthesis by a \"carrier polypeptide\" mechanism as originally proposed by Lascelles.\r"

In this study, we resolved bovine brain 14-3-3 protein into seven polypeptide components by means of reversed-phase chromatography and determined the amino acid sequence of one of these components (eta chain) by cloning its cDNA from a bovine cerebellum cDNA library. The eta-chain mRNA is 1.8 kilobases long and encodes a polypeptide of 246 amino acids and Mr 28,221. Computer-assisted analysis of the sequence indicates that the eta chain exhibits no internal sequence repeats, nor does it have significant sequence similarity to other proteins with known amino acid sequence. However, the eta chain appears to consist of two structural regions that are distinguishable in their clearly different charge characteristics: the almost neutral amino-terminal region and the strongly acidic carboxyl-terminal region. The structural features of the eta chain and the domain organization of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases suggest that the 14-3-3 protein binds to the regulatory domain of the phosphorylated hydroxylases through its acidic carboxyl-terminal region and activates the hydroxylases by inducing an active conformation.\r"

RBCS upstream sequences from tomato, pea (Pisum sativum, Leguminosae), and Arabidopsis are recognized by the factor. The factor recognition occurs via a short conserved sequence (G box) whose consensus sequence is 5'-TCTTACACGTGGCAYY-3' (where Y is pyrimidine). This sequence is distinct from the GT motif described previously in RBCS promoters. Two other conserved sequences, showing a lesser degree of evolutionary conservation, are found upstream of the G box but do not bind to the G box binding factor (GBF). Twelve nucleotides within the G box are sufficient for the formation of a stable DNA-GBF complex. GBF is found in both light-grown and dark-adapted tomato leaf extracts, but it is present in greatly reduced amounts in root extracts.\r"

All retrovirus nucleocapsid proteins contain one or two of these motifs, and they represent the only conserved sequences among these proteins. Sequence analysis of nucleocapsid from avian myeloblastosis virus shows that it also contains two Cys-His sequences and, in fact, differs from the Rous sarcoma nucleocapsid protein only in three residues near the carboxyl terminus. The hypothesized role of the conserved cysteines and histidines as zinc ligands was tested experimentally. No tightly bound metal ions were detected for avian myeloblastosis nucleocapsid protein, and the molar amount of zinc in virions was less by a factor of 50 than that of the nucleocapsid protein. Added Zn2+ did not significantly affect nucleocapsid binding to poly(ethenoadenylic acid) or its secondary structure, as determined from circular dichroism. Nevertheless, the conserved cysteine and histidine residues of the Rous sarcoma (Prague-C strain) nucleocapsid protein are essential for fully functional virus, as shown by the fact that single-site substitutions of five of the six conserved cysteines and either of the two histidine residues blocked viral replication.\r"

We have cloned and sequenced two human adrenodoxin reductase cDNAs that differ by the presence of six additional codons in the middle of one clone. The sequence in this region indicates that these six extra codons arise by alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA. Southern blot hybridization patterns of human genomic DNA cut with four restriction enzymes indicate that the human genome has only one gene for adrenodoxin reductase. Analysis of a panel of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids localized this gene to chromosome 17cen----q25. The alternatively spliced mRNA containing the six extra codons represents 10-20% of all adrenodoxin reductase mRNA. The expression of the adrenodoxin reductase gene may be stimulated by pituitary tropic hormones acting through cAMP, but its response is quantitatively much less than the responses of P450scc and adrenodoxin.\r"

By using these clones we demonstrate that there is a single-copy Ldh-B gene in duck and in chicken. In the duck lens this gene is overexpressed, and its product is subject to posttranslational modification. Reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the LDH protein family reveals that the mammalian Ldh-C gene most probably originated from an ancestral Ldh-A gene and that the amino acid replacement rate in LDH-C is approximately 4 times the rate in LDH-A. Molecular modeling of LDH-B sequences shows that the increased thermostability of the avian tetramer might be explained by mutations that increase the number of ion pairs. Furthermore, the replacement of bulky side chains by glycines on the corners of the duck protein suggests an adaptation to facilitate close packing in the lens.\r"

In primary liver cultures, extremely low concentrations of estradiol-17 beta, which are below the Kd of the Xenopus laevis estrogen receptor, maintain persistent induction of estrogen receptor mRNA but not of estrogen-inducible vitellogenin mRNA. These data and the ability of the antiestrogen, hydroxytamoxifen, to reverse persistent induction of estrogen receptor mRNA, support a model in which transient doses of estradiol-17 beta induce the estrogen receptor and thereby establish an autoregulatory loop. The low levels of estradiol-17 beta normally circulating in male X. laevis and the elevated level of receptor provide sufficient hormone-receptor complex to permanently maintain the induced level of expression of the estrogen receptor gene. The permanent induction of the estrogen receptor may be the regulatory switch that results in the persistent expression of a recently identified class of proteins that exhibit long-term responses to estrogen.\r"

In this paper, we identify two cis-acting sequence elements needed for regulation by p27rex: a 5' splice signal and a specific sequence in the 3' LTR. These two sequence elements are sufficient for regulation by p27rex; expression of a cellular gene (metallothionein I) became sensitive to rex regulation when the LTR was inserted at the 3' end of this gene. The requirement for these two elements suggests an unusual regulatory mechanism of RNA processing in the nucleus.\r"

  ".W": "Site-specific mutagenesis of the blood vessel-inducing protein angiogenin has been used to further explore both its homology to pancreatic ribonuclease and the functional roles of particular residues. Replacement of Asp-116 in angiogenin by either asparagine (D116N), alanine (D116A), or histidine (D116H) markedly enhances both its ribonucleolytic activity and angiogenic potency. Activity toward tRNA is 8-, 15-, and 18-fold greater than native angiogenin for D116N-, D116A-, and D116H-angiogenin, respectively. The enzymatic specificity of angiogenin, however, has been maintained. Thus, cleavage of 18S and 28S rRNA by the most active His-116 mutant yields the same pattern of polynucleotide products as from angiogenin, whereas there are only minor alterations in activity with cytidylyl(3',5')adenosine and uridylyl(3',5')-adenosine. Extensive biological assays on the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane demonstrate that D116H-angiogenin is one to two orders of magnitude more potent in inducing neovascularization than native angiogenin, which correlates well with enhanced enzymatic action. These results support the proposition that the enzymatic and angiogenic activities on angiogenin are interrelated.\r"

The kinase activity was followed through several purification steps, and a radioactive protein of Mr 70,000 was obtained from the stimulated cells. This band was not detected in resting cells. The Mr 70,000 protein exhibited the same size upon NaDodSO4/PAGE as the homogeneous kinase, and it comigrated with the in vitro autophosphorylated form of the enzyme. Treatment of the in vivo-labeled material with phosphatase 2A led to a loss of kinase activity concomitant with a release of 32Pi from the Mr 70,000 protein. The partially dephosphorylated protein migrated faster during PAGE, displaying distinct species of Mr 69,000 and 68,000. Most importantly, phospho amino acid analysis of the labeled S6 kinase showed only phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. These results argue that the S6 kinase is phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo and that it is activated by serine/threonine phosphorylation.\r"

A plasmid containing the HPV-16 genome and a neomycin-selectable marker was transfected into primary human epidermal cells and SCC-13 cells, an immortalized squamous cell carcinoma cell line. Cloned neomycin-resistant cell lines were isolated and examined by cell culture on raised collagen rafts. Cell lines containing HPV-16 DNA retained the ability to stratify and express differentiation-specific keratins in the raft system but otherwise failed to differentiate normally. The histological abnormalities induced by HPV-16 closely resembled those seen in genital intraepithelial neoplasia in vivo.

  ".W": "5-Amino-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole 5'-monophosphate (AIR, 1) is the ubiquitous precursor to the purine ribonucleotides in vivo, and it serves as the biochemical precursor to the pyrimidine portion of thiamin (vitamin B1) in certain prokaryotic organisms. The corresponding ribonucleoside (AIRs, 5b) was prepared via chemical (nonenzymatic) synthesis from 5-amino-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide. The tri-O-acetylated derivative of AIRs (5a) was also prepared, and it was shown to undergo a facile ring transformation in aqueous pH 7 buffer to afford N-(imidazol-4-yl)-2,3,5-tri-O-acetyl-D-ribofuranosylamine as a 1:2 mixture of alpha and beta anomers (6a). Under similar conditions, compound 5b affords the corresponding unprotected beta-ribonucleosides 6b. This Dimroth-type ring transformation reaction of 5 to 6, which occurs primarily in neutral aqueous solution, may be responsible for the previously reported lability of AIRs and its derivatives. It may also have relevance to the postulated early biotic pathway to the 9- and 3-substituted purine nucleotide components of an all-purine biopolymer.\r"

The entire coding sequences of the human DNA topoisomerase II gene were determined from these and several additional clones, identified through the use of the cloned human TOP2 gene sequences as probes. Hybridization between the cloned sequences and mRNA and genomic DNA indicates that the human enzyme is encoded by a single-copy gene.

  ".W": "Verapamil, a phenylalkylamine calcium channel blocker, has been shown to reverse multidrug resistance in tumor cells, possibly by increasing drug retention through interaction with an outward drug transporter of the resistant cells. In this study two photoactive radioactive analogs of verapamil, N-(p-azido[3,5-3H]benzoyl)aminomethyl verapamil and N-(p-azido[3-125I]salicyl)aminomethyl verapamil, were synthesized and used to identify the possible biochemical target(s) for verapamil in multidrug-resistant DC-3F/VCRd-5L Chinese hamster lung cells selected for resistance to vincristine. The results show that a specifically labeled 150- to 180-kDa membrane protein in resistant cells was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody specific for P-glycoprotein. Phenylalkylamine binding specificity was established by competitive blocking of specific photolabeling with the nonradioactive photoactive analogs as well as with verapamil. Photoaffinity labeling was also inhibited by 50 microM concentrations of the calcium channel blockers nimodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine, azidopine, bepridil, and diltiazem and partially by prenylamine. Bay K8644, a calcium channel agonist, also inhibited P-glycoprotein photolabeling. Moreover, P-glycoprotein labeling was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by vinblastine with half-maximal inhibition at 0.2 microM compared to that by verapamil at 8 microM. Photolabeling was also partially inhibited by two of the drugs to which these cells are cross-resistant, doxorubicin and actinomycin D, at 100 microM, but not by colchicine. These data provide direct evidence that P-glycoprotein has broad drug recognition capacity and that it serves as a molecular target for calcium channel blocker action in reversing multidrug resistance.\r"

  ".U": "89017164\r", 
  ".W": "Early in adenovirus infection, the E1A (early region 1A) oncogene products trans-activate the other early viral transcription units, as well as some cellular promoters. The mechanism by which E1A elicits its activity is still unknown. In this report, I show that the adenovirus E2a and E3 promoters are cAMP inducible in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and that this activation requires the presence of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase II. Using deletion mutants of the E2a promoter, it was found that the sequence TACGTCAT located between positions -70 and -77 is involved in both the cAMP response and the E1A trans-activation. Also, in the mutant PC12 cell line A126-2B, which lacks the cAMP-dependent protein kinase II, E1A is still able to activate E2a and E3 promoters. This suggests that E1A products may circumvent the lack of the kinase by activating an alternative signal transduction pathway, which could mimic the effect of agonists of adenylate cyclase. I propose that E1A is capable of modifying by phosphorylation, either directly or indirectly, the transcription factor that binds the ACGTCA motif. Such a factor, termed ATF (adenovirus transcription factor), has already been characterized and appears to have strong similarities to the transcriptional factor CREB (cAMP responsive element binding protein), which binds homologous sequences in cAMP responsive genes, such as somatostatin and c-fos.\r"

  ".W": "The bryostatins are macrocyclic lactones that represent an additional structural class of potent activators of protein kinase C. These marine animal biosynthetic products are of unusual interest because they induce only a subset of the biological responses induced by the phorbol esters. We have now determined the binding affinities of naturally occurring and semisynthetic bryostatins for protein kinase C by competition analysis with [26-3H]bryostatin 4 as the radioactive ligand. Esterification of the hydroxyl group at C26 caused dramatic loss of activity as did inversion of the asymmetric center at this position. In contrast, neither of the ester groups at C7 and C20 had a major influence on activity. Computer modeling of the phorbol esters, related diterpenes, and indole alkaloids suggested that the C20, C9, and C4 oxygens of phorbol represented critical elements of the phorbol ester pharmacophore. The C26 oxygen of the bryostatins, together with the C1 and C19 oxygens, gave an excellent spatial correlation with this model, with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.16 A (compared to 0.10-0.35 A among phorbol-related diterpenes). The extension of the phorbol ester pharmacophore model to the bryostatins and its agreement with the structure-activity relations for the bryostatin class of compounds provide additional support for the validity of the model.\r"

There is a considerable sequence similarity among ARs and the receptors for glucocorticoids, progestins, and mineralocorticoids within the steroid-binding domains. The cysteine-rich DNA-binding domains are well conserved. Translation of mRNA transcribed from AR cDNAs yielded 94- and 76-kDa proteins and smaller forms that bind to DNA and have high affinity toward androgens. These rat or human ARs were recognized by human autoantibodies to natural ARs. Molecular hybridization studies, using AR cDNAs as probes, indicated that the ventral prostate and other male accessory organs are rich in AR mRNA and that the production of AR mRNA in the target organs may be autoregulated by androgens.\r"

We found a potassium-selective channel that requires internal calcium to open and has a 175-pS conductance. This channel differs from calcium-activated potassium channels that have been found in other cells in that it closes when the internal calcium concentration is increased above about 160 nM. This channel can account for the depolarization that occurs in parathyroid cells in high-calcium solutions. It may also account for the reduced secretion in high-calcium solutions.\r"

One positive clone out of 450,000 clones was isolated and found to be incomplete. This clone was used to rescreen the library, and a second, overlapping clone that contained the entire coding sequence was isolated. RNA gel blots showed that the two overlapping clones contained approximately 90% of the reductase mRNA sequence. Sequencing data showed (i) that rat reductase has a 93% sequence similarity with bovine and human reductase and (ii) that reductase is not synthesized as a high molecular weight precursor. Results of Southern blot analysis were consistent with the hypothesis that a single gene codes for the soluble and membrane-bound (microsomal and mitochondrial) forms of the reductase, present in erythrocytes and liver, respectively. The cloned cDNA was used to study reductase transcripts in liver and reticulocytes. Two antisense RNA probes that together covered the entire coding region and part of the noncoding region of reductase mRNA were used in RNase A protection experiments. These probes detected only one transcript in liver, suggesting that endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial reductase are translated from the same mRNA. In contrast, two transcripts were detected in reticulocytes, one of which mismatched the liver probe approximately 30 nucleotides downstream from the initiation codon. Since the soluble and membrane form of the reductase are known to differ at the N terminus, we suggest that this second transcript encodes soluble reductase.\r"

Both lines were obtained by selective growth in lung or liver after injection of tumor cells into a tail vein or portal vein. Contrary to common concepts, the cells of the liver-colonizing melanoma line do not accumulate preferentially in the liver after intravenous administration in vivo. However, the selective survival and proliferation of these melanoma cells in the target organ (liver) may be explained by the unexpected observation that they can be specifically stimulated to proliferate in the presence of hepatocytes, whereas the cells of the lung-colonizing line cannot. Growth promotion under coculture conditions in vitro was monitored both by thymidine incorporation into DNA and by increase in cell numbers. The proliferative stimulus is not mediated by an easily diffusible factor but rather depends upon direct contact between liver cells and those tumor cells that metastasize to that particular organ.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of polyvalent antigens to IgE present in Fc epsilon receptors on the surface of mast cells and the RBL-2H3 cell line triggers the exocytotic release of allergic mediators. Preincubation of RBL-2H3 cells with cholera toxin (CT) was found to potentiate greater than or equal to 2- to 3-fold the rate and final amount of antigen-induced secretion of [3H]serotonin and N-acetyl beta-D-glucosaminidase. This was accompanied by a more variable increase in the initial rate of antigen-triggered formation of inositol phosphates. The holotoxin was required for potentiation, as neither the A nor the B subunit was effective when added separately. Four observations indicate that cAMP was not the primary effector of the augmentation of secretion caused by CT: (i) culture conditions were found in which CT caused large increases in secretion but very modest (or no) increases in cAMP; (ii) under other conditions, progressive increase in [CT] caused a maximum 2.5- to 3-fold increase in cAMP followed by a return to basal levels, whereas the secretory response saturated and remained stable; (iii) permeant cAMP analogs consistently enhanced secretion at low doses and inhibited at higher doses, but the peak enhancement was always much less than that achieved by an optimal dose of CT; (iv) the selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20-1724 exhibited similar biphasic dose-response curves, the maximum enhancement again being small compared to that caused by CT itself. Both in vitro and in vivo, CT catalyzed transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD to two membrane proteins that comigrated on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with two CT substrates in other cell types, and these were identified by immunoblotting as Gs alpha. These results suggest that ADP-ribosylation of a cholera toxin substrate potentiates IgE-mediated secretion from RBL-2H3 cells by a largely cAMP-independent route.\r"

The concentrations of phosphocreatine in the extracellular fluid in the mouse and rat were found to be 5.6 +/- 1.6 and 2.2 +/- 0.8 mumol/g, respectively, which are higher than the intracellular levels reported for smooth muscles. The creatine concentrations in the seminal vesicular fluid from these two species were 22.8 +/- 3.1 and 13.0 +/- 5.3 mumol/g, respectively. These creatine levels are approximately 100 and 65 times higher than the creatine levels in mammalian blood. Smaller amounts of ATP (phosphocreatine/ATP ratio of 20-40) and traces of ADP were also found. Comparison of the pattern of distribution of macromolecules (proteins and DNA) with the distribution of phosphocreatine between the cells and the fluid of the seminal vesicle indicates that cell lysis did not account for the phosphocreatine in the seminal vesicle fluid. Rather, the available evidence strongly suggests that this high-energy compound is actively secreted. We found that in the testes, the sperm are exposed to the highest known creatine concentration in any mammalian tissue studied. Based on these results and other recent reports, we propose that the extracellular phosphocreatine, ATP, and creatine are involved in sperm metabolism.\r"

The human sequence preserves the Glu-Thr-Asp-Lys-Ala motif of the lipoyl-binding site and has two potential binding sites.

Donor cells replace the host erythrocytes, but the fate of the more labile blood components, such as granulocytes and platelets, after transplantation into adult mice has not been established. In the present work, the rate of replacement of the various hemopoietic cells in W/Wv transplant recipients was examined by exploiting host-donor differences in cellular markers (hemoglobin and glucose-phosphate isomerase). Limiting dilutions of +/+ parental cells were injected into F1-hybrid W/Wv anemic mice. A dose of 10(5) donor cells was necessary for the implantation of sufficient multipotent stem cells to alleviate the anemia. Erythrocyte parameters were not significantly different from normal values, and donor cells replaced at least 90% of the host erythrocytes by 20 weeks after injection. At this time, only 10% of the nucleated leukocytes and none of the platelets were donor-derived. The percentage of donor lymphocytes, granulocytes, and platelets increased slowly thereafter but did not completely replace the host elements by 41 weeks. The maintenance of host leukocytes during rapid donor-erythrocyte replacement indicates cell-specific amplification of committed progenitors.\r"

We have adapted this method for use in chicken embryos and used it to study the disposition of clonally related cells in the optic tectum. We report that descendants of a single precursor form narrow, radially oriented columns that span the thickness of the developing tectum. Analysis of embryos injected with virus at different stages suggests a developmental scheme in which early-born progeny are displaced laterally, late-born progeny are displaced radially, and cell mixing is limited. Many clones remain radially arrayed as laminae form and contribute neurons of diverse types of several laminae. In light of previous studies showing physiological relationships among vertically arrayed neurons, our results suggest that neurons descended from a single precursor are richly interconnected and functionally related.\r"

  ".W": "In the mammalian visual system, the terminal arbors of retinal ganglion cell axons from the two eyes are restricted to mutually exclusive territories within their thalamic target, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Here we have investigated some of the factors that determine the adult morphology of terminal arbors in the cat's retinogeniculate system. Removal of one eye during prenatal life at a time when retinogeniculate axons from the two eyes are extensively intermixed within the LGN perturbs the subsequent morphological development of some but not all axons from the remaining eye. The presence of terminal arbors qualitatively normal in size, shape, and location within the LGN suggests that for some retinal axons, ongoing binocular interactions throughout prenatal life are not needed for the development of normal arbor morphology. However, many of the axons form arbors of abnormal size or location, suggesting that such features of axon morphology are not intrinsically determined for these axons but may be susceptible to external influences. Electrophysiological studies reveal that the abnormal arbors all belong to the functionally distinct Y class of retinal ganglion cells, whereas the normal arbors all belong to X cells. The different responses of X and Y axons to prenatal enucleation demonstrate that during development subsets of a single neuronal population projecting to the same target in the central nervous system can be under different developmental controls for axon arbor differentiation.\r"

Although laboratory evidence is lacking, circumstantial evidence supports the importance of immune factors in the pathogenesis of ALS. In the present study immunoglobulins from 4 of 8 ALS patients induced a significant increase in spontaneous quantal transmitter release as monitored by miniature end-plate potential (MEPP) frequency in mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations at 23 degrees C, whereas immunoglobulins from normal individuals and from patients with other neuromuscular diseases had no effect. At 32 degrees C neither normal nor disease control immunoglobulins influenced MEPP frequency, but 8 of 11 ALS immunoglobulin samples produced a significant increase in spontaneous quantal transmitter release. The enhancing effect could be prevented by 10 mM Mg2+. No effects were noted on MEPP amplitude and muscle resting potential. These findings suggest that the presynaptic terminal of the motor neuron may be an early target and that immunological factors may play an important role in the disease process.\r"

The nucleus hyperstriatum ventrale, pars caudale, was the only song control area that contained cells with estrogen-receptor sites. The number of these cells varied during ontogeny and declined sharply after day 40. No other song areas contained estrogen-target cells despite their ability to undergo masculine differentiation under the influence of estrogen.

The (-) isomer of Bay K 8644 and the (+) isomer of Sandoz compound 202-791 were 100-1000 times more potent than their respective opposite enantiomers in enhancing Ca2+ uptake and dopamine release from striatal synaptosomes. The active isomer of each of these compounds increased Ca2+ entry and dopamine release to the same extent at a concentration of 1 nM. Fast-phase Ca2+ entry into synaptosomes isolated from cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus was sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of Bay K 8644. No effect of Bay K 8644 was observed in synaptosomes isolated from brainstem. Bay K 8644 increased synaptosomal Ca2+ uptake and endogenous dopamine release from striatal synaptosomes only during the initial seconds of KCl-induced depolarization. The greatest increase was observed during the first second of depolarization. No effect was observed after greater than or equal to 5 sec of depolarization. Bay K 8644 did not alter Ca2+ uptake or dopamine release under resting conditions (5 mM KCl) or in response to KCl at greater than 15 mM. The activity of Bay K 8644 was also attenuated by lowering the concentrations of divalent cations in the incubation medium. Agonist activity was observed at Mg2+ concentrations greater than 500 microM (Ca2+ held at 100 microM) and Ca2+ concentrations greater than 100 microM (Mg2+ held at 1000 microM). These results suggest that the Ca2+ channels present in synaptosomes are sensitive to nanomolar concentrations of dihydropyridine agonists under a narrow range of experimental conditions.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that changes in flow at constant pressure alter carotid sinus multi-unit nerve activity. In anesthetized dogs with vascularly isolated carotid sinuses, increases in flow at constant pressure resulted in increases in carotid sinus nerve activity in relation to the increase in flow. The increased activity during flow was not caused by an increase in strain of the sinus wall but was directly related to the increase in shear stress (36.6 +/- 11.7% increase in activity per dyne/cm2; 1 dyne = 0.1 MN). The pressure threshold of single baroreceptor units was determined during a slow pressure ramp with and without flow. Flow caused a significant decrease in pressure threshold from 81.1 +/- 6.1 mmHg (1 mmHg = 1.333 x 10(2) Pa) in the absence of flow to 69.3 +/- 5.7 mmHg with flow. We conclude that there are arterial \"rheoreceptors\" in the carotid sinus that respond to flow at constant pressure and strain. The results with single baroreceptor units indicate also that baroreceptors may be sensitized by increases in flow. Thus, changes in flow per se in addition to changes in arterial pressure may be important determinants of reflex circulatory adjustments.\r"

Although its precise physiologic role is unknown, it can stimulate the pituitary secretion of prolactin and growth hormone. We examined the control of rat galanin (rGal) gene expression in the anterior pituitary using RNA blot and in situ hybridization analyses and using specific RIA. Pituitaries of normal male and ovariectomized female rats contained little detectable rGal mRNA. Treatment of these animals with 17 beta-estradiol increased pituitary rGal mRNA up to 4000-fold. These increases depended on time and dose of estrogen administration and correlated with up to 50-fold increases in pituitary galanin-like immunoreactivity. Galanin-like immunoreactivity was detectable in the plasma of estrogen-treated animals. Pituitary levels of rGal mRNA in female rats varied greater than 30-fold during the estrous cycle, with a peak on estrus and a nadir on diestrus. Estrogen-induced rGal gene expression was also observed in transplantable MtTW15 prolactin- and growth hormone-containing tumors but not in neuronal tissues expressing this gene. These data demonstrate that rGal is a secreted product of rat anterior pituitary cells, where its gene expression is strongly affected by physiologic levels of circulating estrogen.\r"

These parameters can be estimated from the average life history and the pattern of environmental fluctuations in the vital rates. We also show that the distribution of time to extinction (conditional on the event) depends on the magnitude but not the sign of mu. When the environmental fluctuations in vital rates are small or moderate, the diffusion approximation gives accurate estimates of cumulative extinction probabilities obtained from computer simulations.\r"

  ".W": "Molecular mechanisms regulating the binding, amphipathic stabilization, and metabolism of the major neutral lipids (e.g., cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and fatty acids) are well studied, but the details of their movement from a binding compartment to a metabolic compartment deserve further attention. Since all neutral lipids must cross hydrophilic segments of plasma membranes during such movement, we postulate that a critical receptor-like site exists on the plasma membrane to mediate a step between binding and metabolism and that membrane-associated heparin is a key part of this mediator. For example, intestinal brush border membranes containing heparin bind homogeneous human pancreatic 125I-labeled cholesterol esterase (100 kDa) and 125I-labeled triglyceride lipase (52 kDa). This interaction is enzyme concentration-dependent, specific, and saturable and is reversed upon addition of soluble heparin. Scatchard analysis demonstrates a single class of receptors with a Kd of 100 nM and a Bmax of approximately 50-60 pmol per mg of vesicle protein. In contrast, enzymes associated with the hydrolysis of hydrophilic compounds such as amylase, phospholipase A2, and deoxyribonuclease do not bind to intestinal membranes in this manner. Human pancreatic cholesterol esterase also binds specifically and saturably to cultured intestinal epithelial cells (CaCo-2), and soluble heparin significantly diminishes the cellular uptake of the resultant hydrophobic reaction products (cholesterol and free fatty acids). We conclude that a physiological role for intestinal heparin is that of a mediator to bind neutral lipolytic enzymes at the brush border and thus promote absorption of the subsequent hydrolyzed nutrients in the intestine. This mechanism may be a generalizable pathway for transport of neutral lipids into endothelial and other cells.\r"

The structure was solved by a combination of heavy-atom and model phasing. Subsequently, it was refined at 1.8 A resolution by a fast-Fourier restrained least-squares procedure. The crystallographic R factor is 0.152 for data with 7.0 A greater than d greater than 1.8 A and F greater than 2.5 sigma (F) and 0.177 when all data are considered. Eighty-nine solvent molecules have been incorporated into the model. The dense core formed by the alpha-helical and antiparallel beta-sheet moieties and three of the four disulfide bridges is similar in variant 3, a toxin purified from the North American scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus, and in toxin II. However, the two molecules differ markedly in the orientation of loops protruding from the core. Toxin II seems to contain several highly ordered solvent molecules. Eight of them occupy a cavity consisting of the C-terminal region and a loop found only in scorpion alpha-toxins. The highly reactive and pharmacologically important Lys-58 is found at one of the extremes of this cavity, where it establishes a series of hydrogen bonds with protein and solvent atoms. The reactivities of the five lysine residues of toxin II are highly correlated with the formation of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and salt links.\r"

HIV inhibitory activity was found to be dependent on both chain length and the number of phosphonate residues. Introduction of 18 phosphonate groups in an oligomer of chain length 20 significantly increased HIV inhibitory activity relative to the parent oligonucleotide, whereas 5 such groups showed little or no increase in the HIV inhibition capacity. Methylphosphonate-linked oligomers are more stable to nuclease degradation and hence could be potentially useful in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "89017216\r", 
  ".W": "Both mammalian and bacterial ferritin undergo rapid reaction with small-molecule reductants, in the absence of Fe2+ chelators, to form ferritins with reduced (Fe2+) mineral cores. Large, low-potential reductants (flavoproteins and ferredoxins) similarly react anaerobically with both ferritin types to quantitatively produce Fe2+ in the ferritin cores. The oxidation of Fe2+ ferritin by large protein oxidants [cytochrome c and Cu(II) proteins] also occurs readily, yielding reduced heme and Cu(I) proteins and ferritins with Fe3+ in their cores. These latter oxidants also convert enthetically added Fe2+, bound in mammalian or bacterial apo- or holoferritin, to the corresponding Fe3+ state in the core of each ferritin type. Because the protein reductants and oxidants are much larger than the channels leading into the mineral core attached to the ferritin interior, we conclude that redox reactions involving the Fe2+/Fe3+ components of the ferritin core can occur without direct interaction of the redox reagent at the mineral core surface. Our results also suggest that the oxo, hydroxy species of the core, composed essentially of Fe(O)OH, arise exclusively from solvent deprotonation. The long-distance ferritin-protein electron transfer observed in this study may occur by electron tunneling.\r"

The sensitivity of the method is about 10,000-fold that of optical methods and is sufficient to determine the endogenous background of DNA methylation. DNA from the liver of normal young rats (6 months old) contains 7-methylguanine at a level of 1 residue per 31,000 bases in mitochondrial DNA and 1 residue per 105,000 bases in nuclear DNA. These levels increase about 2.5-fold in old rats (24 months old). We attribute this strikingly high level of adducts to endogenous methylation, which could contribute to aging and cancer.\r"

The atria were subjected to three consecutive periods, control, anoxia, and postanoxic recovery, in medium containing tracers of [1-14C]creatine. The tissue content and specific activity of creatine and PCr were determined at the end of each period. The higher specific activity found for tissue PCr (1.87 times) than creatine, independent of the percentage of total intracellular creatine that was present as free creatine, provides evidence for the existence of two separate pools of free creatine. Analysis of the data shows that in the normal oxygenated state approximately equal to 9% of the total intracellular creatine is actually free to participate in the process of energy transport (shuttle pool). About 36% of the total creatine is bound to unknown intracellular components and the rest exists as PCr. The creatine that was taken up and the creatine that was released from the breakdown of PCr have much greater access to the site of phosphorylation than the rest of the intracellular creatine. A sharp increase in the specific activity of residual PCr on prolongation of anoxic time was also observed. This provides evidence for a nonhomogeneous pool of PCr, for the most recently formed (radioactive) PCr appeared to be hydrolyzed last.\r"

  ".W": "Two overlapping human genomic clones that encode a short-chain collagen, designated alpha 1(XIII), were isolated by using recently described cDNA clones. Characterization of the cosmid clones that span approximately equal to 65,000 base pairs (bp) of the 3' end of the gene established several unusual features of this collagen gene. The last exon encodes solely the 3' untranslated region and it begins with a complete stop codon. The 10 adjacent exons vary in size from 27 to 87 bp and two of them are 54 bp. Therefore, the alpha 1-chain gene of type XIII collagen has some features found in genes for fibrillar collagens but other features that are distinctly different. Previous analysis of overlapping cDNA clones and nuclease S1 mapping of mRNAs indicated one alternative splicing site causing a deletion of 36 bp from the mature mRNA. The present study showed that the 36 bp is contained within the gene as a single exon and also that the gene has a 45-bp -Gly-Xaa-Xaa- repeat coding exon not found in the cDNA clones previously characterized. Nuclease S1 mapping experiments indicated that this 45-bp exon is found in normal human skin fibroblast mRNAs. Accordingly, the data demonstrate that there is alternative splicing of at least two exons of the type alpha 1(XIII)-chain gene.\r"

This system uses extracts from wild-type VSV-infected cells as a source of proteins to encapsidate the RNA. In vitro assembled nucleocapsids were compared to in vivo-derived nucleocapsids by the following characteristics: nuclease resistance of the encapsidated RNA, CsCl density banding of labeled RNA in a position coincident with nucleocapsids, correct sedimentation rate in sucrose gradients, the presence of the nucleocapsid protein on the nucleocapsids, and the infectivity of the in vitro assembled nucleocapsids. We conclude that the system we present is capable of assembling the isolated genome of a rhabdovirus DI particle into nucleocapsids indistinguishable from those produced during the course of intracellular DI replication.\r"

The finding that two glucocorticoid responsive elements act cooperatively to stimulate transcription of the tyrosine aminotransferase gene prompted us to explore whether synergistic effects also occur when two different steroid hormone receptors are involved. A region of the chicken vitellogenin II gene that displays homologies to glucocorticoid and estradiol responsive elements was tested for its capability to confer estradiol and glucocorticoid inducibility to a heterologous promoter. When positioned immediately upstream of the thymidine kinase gene promoter, this element enhances expression by either steroid. Combination of both hormones results in a synergistic increase of transcription. Mutational analysis shows that sequences that show similarities of glucocorticoid and estradiol responsive elements are absolutely required for hormone induction. Analysis of the dose dependence of induction by both steroids demonstrates that half-maximal activity is observed at lower hormone concentrations when the other steroid is present in saturating amounts, which suggests that the synergistic induction observed with the combination of hormones is based on a functional interaction of the two hormone receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The binding of colicin E1 and its COOH-terminal channel-forming peptides to artificial membrane vesicles has an optimum at acidic pH values. The Mr 18,000 thermolytic peptide inserted into membrane vesicles at pH 4.0 has a limited accessibility to exogenous protease. It is converted by trypsin cleavage after Lys-381 and Lys-382 to a lower Mr 14,000 peptide. However, when the pH of a vesicle suspension to which peptide has been bound at pH 4.0 is shifted to 6.0, the accessibility to protease increased greatly. This was shown (i) by the large decrease in the amount of Mr 14,000 or Mr 18,000 peptide after the pH 4----6 shift and treatment with trypsin or Pronase, consistent with (ii) a previously observed decrease in membrane-bound radiolabeled peptide after protease treatment. (iii) When a photoactivable nitrene-generating phospholipid probe was used to label the colicin peptide inserted into the bilayer, the extent of labeling decreased by a factor of 3 when the pH was shifted from 4.0 to 6.5. (iv) Colicin peptide added to vesicles at pH 4.0 can \"hop\" to other vesicles if the pH and ionic strength of donor vesicles are successively increased. It is proposed that deprotonation of acidic residues in contact with the hydrophobic bilayer or the membrane surface destabilizes the inserted channel and causes it to be extruded from the membrane. The pH-dependent extrusion of the inserted colicin channel provides an example of dynamic properties of an intrinsic membrane protein.\r"

This endogenous phosphorylation can be reproduced with platelet-rich plasma, after stimulation with thrombin, but not with plasma devoid of platelets. Stimulation of isolated platelets (\"washed\" by gel filtration) with either thrombin or ADP brings about a release of this kinase. The supernatant of these stimulated platelets, which contains the kinase, does not undergo a cAMP-dependent endogenous phosphorylation because it does not contain the 135-kDa protein substrate. On the other hand, plasma devoid of platelets does not contain cAMP-dependent protein kinase. By combining the supernatant of the physiologically stimulated platelets with the plasma devoid of platelets, it is possible to reconstitute the system and to reproduce the specific endogenous phosphorylation of the 135-kDa target substrate. On the basis of the above evidence it is proposed that upon physiological stimulation of platelets, they release into the blood a cAMP-dependent protein kinase in addition to the well-known release of MgATP. This kinase specifically phosphorylates the 135-kDa plasma protein.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II)/mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptors immunoprecipitated from purified plasma membranes of 32P-labeled rat adipocytes are markedly heterogenous in their phosphorylation state. Approximately 80% of the plasma membrane receptors are solubilized in 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 and are phosphorylated on serine residues at a stoichiometry of approximately 0.1-0.2 mol of phosphate per mol of receptor. In contrast, 15-20% of the receptors are Triton X-100-insoluble and are phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues at approximately 4 or 5 mol of phosphate per mol of receptor. This Triton X-100-insoluble membrane subfraction contains only 5% of the total plasma membrane protein and yet contains all of the clathrin heavy chain associated with plasma membrane, as detected by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody. Based on the relative yields of protein in the detergent-insoluble material, IGF-II/Man-6-P receptors are concentrated approximately equal to 3-fold in this clathrin-enriched subfraction. Insulin treatment of intact cells increased the total IGF-II/Man-6-P receptors in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of the plasma membrane, whereas no change in receptor number in the detergent-insoluble fraction was seen. However, insulin markedly decreased the phosphorylation stoichiometry of the Triton X-100-insoluble receptors. Taken together, these results indicate that insulin decreases the phosphorylation state of a highly phosphorylated subpopulation of IGF-II/Man-6-P receptors on the plasma membrane. In addition, insulin action may prevent the concentration of these receptors in a clathrin-enriched membrane subfraction.\r"

  ".W": "The 120-kDa lysosomal membrane glycoprotein (lgp120) is an acidic, heavily glycosylated membrane protein enriched in the lysosomal membrane. To determine the basis for its selective transport to and stability in lysosomes, we have investigated the structure of lgp120. By using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the amino terminus of rat lgp120, we isolated and characterized cDNA clones containing the entire coding region. The deduced amino acid sequence demonstrates that lgp120 contains a putative signal peptide, 18 sites for N-linked glycosylation, a single membrane-spanning segment, and a short (11 amino acid) cytosolic tail. The sequence suggests a distinct domain organization, with two luminal glycosylated regions separated by a nonglycosylated proline-rich region. Proteolysis in detergent showed that the protein was not intrinsically resistant to exogenous or endogenous proteases. The N-linked oligosaccharides on lgp120, tetraantennary structures with two lactosamine repeats on one of the branches, were not different from those of glycoproteins on the plasma membrane. lgp120 was similar in its domain organization and portions of its amino acid sequence to the avian 100-kDa lysosomal membrane protein LEP100 [Fambrough, D. M., Takeyasu, K., Lippincott-Schwartz, J., Siegel, N. R. & Somerville, D. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 106, 61-67], and to a distinct 110-kDa lysosomal membrane protein (lgp110) that colocalizes with lgp120. The similarities between lysosomal membrane glycoproteins from diverse species, coupled with the fact that at least two distinct lysosomal membrane glycoproteins are expressed in a single species, indicate the existence of a conserved family of glycoproteins enriched in the lysosomal membrane.\r"

We previously constructed DNAs encoding vesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteins with N-terminal extensions preceding the signal sequence and showed that these extensions allowed normal signal-sequence function and cleavage in vivo. To analyze signal sequence topology during membrane insertion, we generated a point mutation that blocks cleavage of these signal sequences. After expressing these proteins in HeLa cells, we used proteolysis of microsomal membranes to determine that the N terminus of the signal sequence and the C terminus of each protein remain on the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum after insertion. This result indicates that the proteins were inserted in a looped configuration. Extending this finding, we were able to reverse the orientation of such a mutant protein by deleting its normal C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. In addition to demonstrating that a signal sequence can function as a membrane anchor, these findings show that except for the presence of a cleavage site, the cleaved signal sequence of a type I transmembrane protein is structurally and functionally equivalent to the noncleaved signal sequences of type II transmembrane proteins.\r"

The mutations take three forms: (i) a large deletion that removes the entire ligand-binding domain of EGFR, (ii) smaller deletions that affect the carboxyl-terminal domain of EGFR, and (iii) point mutations that cause conservative substitutions of amino acids. Previous work has shown that, in the absence of the large deletion, ERBB1 cannot transform cells autonomously. Here we report that when the large deletion is present, no other mutation is required for ERBB1 to transform established rodent fibroblasts to a tumorigenic phenotype. In particular, there is no need for deletions affecting the carboxyl terminus of the gene product. It appears, therefore, that removal of the ligand-binding domain from the EGFR suffices to create a transforming protein. Deletions at the carboxyl terminus of the EGFR apparently play only a secondary role in transformation by affecting the host range and perhaps the potency of transformation; and there is as yet no evidence to implicate point mutations in the activation of ERBB1 to an oncogene. Our findings support the view that augmented activity of the EGFR can contribute to tumorigenesis.\r"

Amastigote intracellular pH is maintained close to neutral at external pH values as low as 4.0. Both life stages maintain a positive pH gradient to an extracellular pH of 7.4, which is important for active transport of substrates. Treatment with ionophores, such as nigericin and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and the ATPase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, reduced pH gradients in both stages. Maintenance of intracellular pH in the physiologic range is especially relevant for the survival of the amastigote in its acidic in vivo environment.\r"

  ".W": "We report that endogenous regulatory factors mediating expression of a lineage-specific sea urchin embryo gene can be titrated in vivo by introduction of a sufficient molar excess of DNA-binding sites. Thus we obtain an estimate of the quantity of limiting factor(s) required for developmental activation and transcriptional expression, which can be compared with estimates of factor prevalence obtained by measurements in vitro carried out under equilibrium conditions. A fusion construct in which the bacterial gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT; acetyl-CoA:chloramphenicol O3-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.28) is controlled by cis-regulatory elements of the CyIIIa cytoskeletal actin gene (CyIIIa-CAT) was introduced in varying numbers of copies into sea urchin eggs. The activity of the CyIIIa-CAT fusion gene in 24-hr blastula-stage embryos was shown to saturate as the number of exogenous genes was increased. The mean number of CyIIIa-CAT fusion genes per nucleus at which half saturation was obtained was 105 +/- 40 (mean +/- SD). This result suggests that equilibrium parameters measured earlier in vitro may apply, at least approximately, within the embryo nuclei.\r"

L. & Melton, D. A. (1987) Cell 51, 861-867]. Because RNA-cytoskeletal interactions may play a role in RNA localization, we have examined the association of Vg1 RNA with components of the oocyte's cytoskeleton. Gel and immunoblot analysis of a detergent-insoluble fraction revealed a greatly simplified protein pattern composed largely of cytokeratins and vimentin. In sharp contrast to the nonlocalized histone H3 mRNA, Vg1 RNA was concentrated some 35- to 50-fold in this insoluble fraction. Extractions at higher salt concentrations yielded preparations further enriched in cytokeratins and in the Vg1 RNA. Upon ovulation, VG1 RNA is released into the soluble fraction. This change in Vg1 RNA distribution coincides with the observed breakdown of cortical cytokeratin filaments [Klymkowsky, M. W., Maynell, L. A. & Polson, A. G. (1987) Development 100, 543-557] and the loss of Vg1 RNA from the cortical region. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that RNA-cytoskeletal interactions are involved in the localization and segregation of information during development.\r"

Earlier studies of cDNAs for chicken L-CAM established the amino acid sequence of the mature protein. The sequence has now been extended in the 5' direction through the precursor and signal sequences and past a consensus translation initiation site. The combined cDNAs were used to isolate genomic clones covering the entire L-CAM coding sequence. The structural gene for chicken L-CAM contains 16 exons ranging in size from 115 to over 1045 base pairs with an average size of 222 base pairs. Single exons do not correspond to known structural elements such as the signal sequence, precursor segment, internal repeats, or membrane-spanning region of L-CAM. Hybridization of restriction digests of chicken genomic DNA with cDNA and genomic probes indicated that there is a single L-CAM gene in the chicken. In contrast to genes for other cell-cell or cell-substrate adhesion molecules, there is no evidence for alternative splicing of exons in this gene.\r"

The species branching order is shown to be mouse, cow/goat, human, and rabbit. Relative rate tests involving paralogous and orthologous genes provide no evidence of heterogeneity, among species, in the rate of evolution of the genes. This result is discrepant with the conclusions of most other recent, similar studies. By comparison with previous studies, the present study is based on a sound phylogeny and involves a larger sample of species, genes, and genic regions. The result provides strong support for the neutral theory of molecular evolution and demonstrates that molecular evolutionary rate does not depend on generation time.\r"

The nucleotide sequence for Macaca mulatta provided the outgroup perspective needed to evaluate better the relationships of humans and great apes.

  ".U": "89017254\r", 
  ".W": "We previously reported that in childhood adrenoleukodystrophy (C-ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), the peroxisomal beta-oxidation system for very long chain (greater than C22) fatty acids is defective. To further define the defect in these two forms of X chromosome-linked ALD, we examined the oxidation of [1-14C]lignoceric acid (n-tetracosanoic acid, C24:0) and [1-14C]lignoceroyl-CoA (substrates for the first and second steps of beta-oxidation, respectively). The oxidation rates of lignoceric acid in C-ALD and AMN were 43% and 36% of control values, respectively, whereas the oxidation rate of lignoceroyl-CoA was 109% (C-ALD) and 106% (AMN) of control values, respectively. On the other hand, the oxidation rates of palmitic acid (n-hexadecanoic acid) and palmitoyl-CoA in C-ALD and AMN were similar to the control values. These results suggest that lignoceroyl-CoA ligase activity may be impaired in C-ALD and AMN. To identify the specific enzymatic deficiency and its subcellular localization in C-ALD and AMN, we established a modified procedure for the subcellular fractionation of cultured skin fibroblasts. Determination of acyl-CoA ligase activities provided direct evidence that lignoceroyl-CoA ligase is deficient in peroxisomes while it is normal in mitochondrial and microsomes. Moreover, the normal oxidation of lignoceroyl-CoA as compared with the deficient oxidation of lignoceric acid in isolated peroxisomes also supports the conclusion that peroxisomal lignoceroyl-CoA ligase is impaired in both C-ALD and AMN. Palmitoyl-Coa ligase activity was found to be normal in peroxisomes as well as in mitochondria and microsomes. This normal peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA ligase activity as compared with the deficient activity of lignoceroyl-CoA ligase in C-ALD and AMN suggests the presence of two separate acyl-CoA ligases for palmitic and lignoceric acids in peroxisomes. These data clearly demonstrate that the pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in C-ALD and AMN is due to a deficiency of peroxisomal very long chain (lignoceric acid) acyl-CoA ligase.\r"

Further, individual alleles in a heterozygote can be sequenced directly by using allele-specific oligonucleotides either in the amplification reaction or as sequencing primers. By using these methods, we have studied the allelic diversity at the HLA-DQA locus and its association with the serologically defined HLA-DR and -DQ types. This analysis has revealed a total of eight alleles and three additional haplotypes. This procedure has wide applications in screening for mutations in human genes and facilitates the linking of enzymatic amplification of genes to automated sequencing.\r"

Clinical severity is variable, ranging from death in utero (due to severe rickets) to pathologic fractures first presenting in adult life. Affected siblings, however, are phenotypically similar. Severe forms of the disease are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion; heterozygotes often show reduced serum ALP activity. The specific gene defects in hypophosphatasia are unknown but are thought to occur either at the L/B/K ALP locus or within another gene that regulates L/B/K ALP expression. We used the polymerase chain reaction to examine L/B/K ALP cDNA from a patient with a perinatal (lethal) form of the disease. We observed a guanine-to-adenine transition in nucleotide 711 of the cDNA that converts alanine-162 of the mature enzyme to threonine. The affected individual, whose parents are second cousins, is homozygous for the mutant allele. Introduction of this mutation into an otherwise normal cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis abolishes the expression of active enzyme, demonstrating that a defect in the L/B/K ALP gene results in hypophosphatasia and that the enzyme is, therefore, essential for normal skeletal mineralization.\r"

After transfection with chrysotile, a minor percentage of introduced plasmid DNA bearing a simian virus 40 origin of replication replicates after 24 hr. Fragmentation of entering DNA is more prominent with asbestos than with calcium phosphate, and after 72 hr most DNA introduced by asbestos is associated with chromosomal DNA. Cells transfected with plasmid p11-4, bearing the p53 protooncogene, express this gene. Cells transfected with pSV2-neo express a gene conferring resistance of antibiotic G418, allowing isolation of colonies of transformed cells after 18 days. The introduction of exogenous DNA into eukaryotic cells could cause mutations in several ways and thus contribute to asbestos-induced oncogenesis.\r"

Molecular genetic analysis of Down syndrome (DS) patients with partial trisomy 21 allowed us to reinforce the supposition that ETS2 may be a gene of the minimal DS genetic region. It was originally proposed that a duplication of a portion of the DS region represents the genetic basis of Alzheimer disease, a condition associated also with DS. No evidence of either rearrangements or duplications of ETS2 could be detected in DNA from fibroblasts and brain tissue of Alzheimer disease patients with either the sporadic or the familiar form of the disease.

Four major V alpha haplotypes were defined on the basis of multiple restriction fragment length polymorphisms for each of nine V alpha subfamily probes used. Southern blotting also revealed haplotype-specific loss of bands within some V alpha subfamilies, consistent with the deletion of particular V alpha genes or sets of genes from haplotype to haplotype. In contrast to the situation in the V beta locus, however, deletion of entire V alpha subfamilies was not observed. The nature of V alpha allelic variability was further explored by using an RNase protection assay to analyze expressed V alpha mRNA sequences in thymocyte RNA. Such analysis revealed both shared and unique patterns of V alpha mRNA expression among the different haplotypes and supported the conclusion that haplotype differences sometimes involve V alpha gene deletions. Interestingly, a disproportionate number of, but not all, autoimmune-susceptible strains, including NZB, SJL, SWR, PL/J, and NOD, share a common V alpha haplotype. The identification of murine TCR V alpha haplotypes should provide a basis for understanding the role of TCR diversity in normal immunoregulatory and immune-response phenomena, as well as autoimmune-disease predisposition.\r"

During their interactions with fibrinogen-coated surfaces, PMN make such close contact with the surface that a portion of the secreted elastase activity is protected from macromolecular protease inhibitors in the surrounding medium. Here we show that the receptor on PMN that mediates this interaction is complement receptor type 3 (CR3; CD11b/CD18), a molecule previously identified as a receptor for the complement protein fragment C3bi. Monoclonal antibodies against CR3 that block the binding of C3bi also block the binding of PMN to fibrinogen-coated surfaces and the formation of a protected compartment. The region of fibrinogen recognized by CR3 lies at the carboxyl terminus of the gamma chain, since peptides based on this sequence effectively inhibit the binding of PMN to fibrinogen-coated surfaces. These peptides also block the binding of C3bi-coated erythrocytes to CR3, thus indicating that a single binding site is used for binding both C3bi and fibrinogen. Sequence analysis shows strong structural similarity between this region of fibrinogen and other known ligands of CR3. These studies thus indicate that CR3 functions as a receptor not only for C3bi but also for fibrinogen.\r"

To study the poliovirus-cell interaction, eight monoclonal antibodies that specifically block the cytopathic effects of poliovirus were generated by using HeLa cell preparations as immunogen and a newly developed colorimetric screening assay. Plaque-inhibition assays confirmed the viral specificity of the antibodies, and when one antibody, AF3, was used as a probe in immunoblots of cell membrane preparations, it detected a 100-kDa band in only those cell lines and tissues permissive for poliovirus infection. AF3 also specifically inhibited radiolabeled poliovirus binding to cells. In terms of tissue specificity, AF3 detected the 100-kDa band in membrane preparations from human spinal cord but not in organ homogenates of human kidney or in murine tissue, including the central nervous system. Furthermore, AF3 detected the band in a human-mouse hybrid cell line containing human chromosome 19, which confers permissivity for poliovirus infection, but the antibody did not detect the band in a human chromosome 19-deficient subclone. In an immunohistochemical study of the human brainstem, AF3 stained neurons in the reticular formation and clusters of brainstem neurons, consistent with the known pattern of damage caused by poliovirus infection in the brainstem. Furthermore, AF3 reacted with human peripheral mononuclear cells, consistent with the known replication of poliovirus in Peyer's patches and tonsils. These results strongly suggest that the 100-kDa band detected by antibody AF3 is, or is closely associated with, the poliovirus receptor site.\r"

The presence of rat heart fatty acid binding protein (hFABP) was documented in aortic tissue by using a cDNA probe and polyclonal antibodies. Hypertension was induced in groups of rats by implantation of deoxycorticosterone acetate in conjunction with 1% salt in the drinking water (deoxycorticosterone/salt). By the third week of this treatment a marked reduction (by a factor of 20) in the expression of hFABP mRNA in aorta was found, concomitant with a reduction in immunologically detectable protein, suggesting transcriptional regulation. This effect was tissue specific, since no change in the normal amounts of hFABP mRNA in heart, skeletal muscle, or kidney was found. This reduction in aortic hFABP mRNA was also found in mildly hypertensive uninephrectomized rats given salt but no deoxycorticosterone and in normotensive rats given deoxycorticosterone but no excess salt intake. A marked decrease in aortic hFABP mRNA also was observed in the Goldblatt two kidney-one clip hypertensive model, and administration of angiotensin II for 6 days by osmotic minipump also caused a reduction. These findings suggest that hFABP is under complex regulation in aortic tissue and is suppressed by arterial hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Single amino acid substitutions at the rim of the receptor binding site of the hemagglutinin molecule of swine influenza virus markedly influence the replicative capacity of the virus in chicken embryos, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), and swine as well as its antigenic phenotype. Mutants of low-yield (L) phenotype replicate poorly in chicken embryos and produce small plaques in MDCK cells but are highly infective for swine. Such mutants have lysine at position 153 and glycine at position 155 of the hemagglutinin (residues 156 and 158 in the H3 model). High-yield (H) mutants have the converse replicative characteristics and can be antigenically distinguished from L mutants (and from each other) based on their differential reactivity with two monoclonal antibodies, 9C8 and Sa-13. H mutants differ from L mutants in that the H mutants express glutamic acid at either position 153 or 155. L and H mutants act in an allelic fashion in effecting predictable one-step adaptation to different hosts. Selection for replication (e.g., high-yielding) phenotype results in concordant pleiotropic change in antigenic phenotype and in genotype. Conversely, immunoselection leads to change in replicative phenotype. Although the mechanism by which these mutations affect viral replication has not yet been defined, they may reflect differences in the affinity of each mutant for different host receptors.\r"

ARPP-16 and ARPP-21 were detected only in striatal and cortical cultures. In contrast, ARP-19, which is structurally related to ARPP-16, was also present in reaggregate cultures prepared from thalamus and ventral and dorsal mesencephalon, as well as in monolayer cultures of astroglial cells. In striatal aggregates cultured over a 3-week period, the relative levels of ARPP-16, ARPP-21, and synapsin I/protein IIIa (synaptic vesicle-associated phosphoproteins closely related to each other and treated as a single entity in the present study) increased with time, whereas the level of ARPP-19 decreased. Incubation of striatal aggregates with 8-Br-cAMP, forskolin, or vasoactive intestinal peptide increased the phosphorylation of all these proteins. We conclude that the state of phosphorylation of two proteins enriched in specific neurons (ARPP-16 and ARPP-21) and two more widely distributed proteins (ARPP-19 and synapsin I/protein IIIa) is regulated by cAMP and vasoactive intestinal peptide in striatal cells in culture. These phosphoproteins may therefore play a role in mediating some of the actions of vasoactive intestinal peptide in the caudate-putamen.\r"

The increase in these mRNAs was rapid and transient: amounts peaked within 1 hr and returned to baseline within 2 hr. These results extend the observation made by Morgan et al. [Morgan, J. I., Cohen, D. R., Hempstead, J. L. & Curran, T. (1987) Science 237, 192-197] that c-fos mRNA and protein are induced in rat brain after seizures. We hypothesize that the increase of these putative transcription factor mRNAs in the brain is part of a programmed genomic response of neurons to intense stimulation, which is analogous to the genomic response of nonneuronal cells to growth factors.\r"

Incorporation of 32P into poly(A)- RNA was reduced by as much as 60%. The RNA changes were strongly correlated with the degree of learning and could not be accounted for by changes in [32P]ATP content. The RNA changes were maximal at 24 hr and were still detectable after 4 days, indicating that associative conditioning produces a period of increased DNA transcription that could be an intermediate step in memory consolidation. The RNA changes may in part account for recently observed conditioning-specific changes in the synthesis rates of specific proteins.\r"

We now show that individual quails express alpha, beta, or both AcChoEase polypeptide chains. By mating studies we show that the two AcChoEase polypeptides are autosomal and segregate as codominant alleles in classical Mendelian fashion. Biochemical studies of the two allelic AcChoEase polypeptides indicate that they have the same turnover number, have the same Km for acetylcholine, are immunoprecipitated to the same extent with a monoclonal anti-AcChoEase antibody, and can assemble with equal efficiency into multimeric forms. Thus there are no obvious functional differences between the two alleles. In heterozygotes, the rates of synthesis of the two polypeptides are identical, suggesting that there are no differences in expression of these two genes. Within an individual, nerves and muscles always express the same AcChoEase forms isolated from muscle indicates that all AcChoEase forms are comprised of the same allelic polypeptide chains. In contrast to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that appear to be encoded by complex multigene families, our studies on AcChoEase show that all forms of this important synaptic component in electrically excitable cells are encoded by a single gene. Thus differences in assembly and localization of the multiple synaptic forms of AcChoEase must arise through posttranscriptional events, posttranslational modifications of a similar AcChoEase polypeptide chain or both.\r"

The subunit proteins were mapped in adjacent sections autoradiographically and immunohistochemically. Many brain areas containing high densities of GABAA receptors showed strong hybridization signals with both the alpha- and the beta-subunit antisense RNA probe--e.g., cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. On a cellular level, a dense dendritic localization of GABAA receptors was correlated with a strong hybridization in the corresponding somata--e.g., in mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, pyramidal cells of hippocampus, granule cells of the dentate gyrus, and Purkinje and granule cells of the cerebellum. In some brain areas--e.g., substantia nigra--the intensity of the hybridization signal with the beta-subunit probe was much weaker than that with the alpha-subunit probe, whereas the inverse ratio of hybridization intensity was found in others--e.g., in bed nucleus. This regional heterogeneity in the hybridization pattern may reflect regional differences in RNA stability, transcription rate, or subunit composition. The results open the way for studies on the regulation of GABAA-receptor gene expression in normal and pathological brain in situ.\r"

  ".W": "By light microscopic immunocytochemistry it has been previously shown that approximately equal to 70% of the neurons in rat dorsal root ganglia are labeled with an antiserum for glutamate conjugated to hemocyanin; the smaller among these neurons are also positive for substance P. By using a postembedding ImmunoGold method and electron microscopy, it is shown here that synaptic terminals in the superficial laminae of the spinal cord of rats selectively stain for the same glutamate antiserum. Immunolabeling is in small dome-shaped and in large scalloped synaptic terminals. Scalloped terminals are of two types. One type consists of dark terminals with many agranular vesicles of different size and a few large granular vesicles; these are probably endings of unmyelinated and small myelinated primary afferent fibers. The other type consists of light terminals with small agranular vesicles homogeneous in size with neurofilaments and many mitochondria; these are probably endings of larger myelinated primary afferent fibers. By means of double-labeling electron microscopic immunocytochemistry with colloidal gold particles of two different sizes, it is also shown here that substance P is present in only the dark type of glutamate-labeled scalloped terminals. The primary afferent origin of the terminals labeled by the antisera for glutamate and for substance P is demonstrated by a triple-labeling strategy: immunocytochemistry for both antisera on sections from rats in which dorsal rhizotomy or dorsal root ganglion injection of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin was performed. It is proposed that glutamate is the neurotransmitter in primary afferents mediating input from different peripheral receptor classes, including nociceptors. Effects of glutamate and substance P on spinal dorsal horn neurons may result from co-release of these two mediators from the same dorsal root afferent terminal.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation of erythropoiesis during growth is necessary to ensure proportionality between erythrocyte mass and body mass. However, the way by which erythrocyte formation is adapted to body growth is still unknown. Growth arrest in hypophysectomized rats is accompanied by decreased erythropoiesis. We have, therefore, examined whether insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), the mediator of growth hormone effects on body growth, is able to restore erythropoiesis in these animals. Subcutaneous infusions of 120 micrograms of recombinant human IGF-I per day in hypophysectomized rats led to increases in body weight, 59Fe incorporation into erythrocytes, and the number of reticulocytes that were similar to increases caused by infusions of 28 milliunits of human growth hormone per day. Body weight gain and 59Fe incorporation were linearly correlated. Like growth hormone, IGF-I also caused a significant rise in serum erythropoietin concentrations. However, the stimulatory effect on erythropoiesis occurred before serum erythropoietin levels had risen. These results demonstrate that IGF-I mediates the stimulatory effect of growth hormone on erythropoiesis in vivo and thus further support the somatomedin concept. They also show that IGF-I can stimulate erythropoiesis in an endocrine manner, and they suggest two possible routes of action: a direct one and an indirect one by means of enhanced erythropoietin production.\r"

Twenty healthy subjects walked on a level motor-driven treadmill at two walking speeds (2 and 4 mph) with the accelerometer affixed to different trunk locations (waist belt and chest line). After each five-minute exercise bout, the accelerometer readings (in arbitrary units) were recorded and expressed in counts per minute. The analysis of variance for the Calcount accelerometer data revealed a significant main effect for location and speed. The Caltrac accelerometer data revealed a significant F ratio for the speed main effect and the location x speed interaction effect. Overall, the accelerometer reading when worn at the waist belt was higher (p less than .05) than when affixed to the chest line. For both accelerometers, the output increased with increased walking speed. The correlation between the Caltrac and Calcount accelerometer readings ranged from -.09 to .49, indicating that the output of the two accelerometers cannot be compared directly.\r"

Assessment of posture was performed by a panel of three pediatric physical therapists, using a postural assessment scale designed by the author. A composite score for each test interval was calculated for each child, and a median score was calculated for the entire group at each test interval. Data were analyzed using a Friedman test, assuming an alpha level of .05. A statistically significant difference was found between the three test intervals with significant improvement occurring during the period of therapeutic riding. Clinical improvements were also noted in muscle tone and balance as evidenced by improved functional skills.

Nearly 12% of the study sample (n = 380) demonstrated a visually assessed lateral deviation of the spine. This finding demonstrates a higher prevalence of scoliosis among an age group that has reached an age of growth cessation than the literature on scoliosis screening indicates. The college-aged students in this study demonstrated a higher prevalence of scoliosis than the national norm for a younger (10-15 years of age) group. This result suggests that scoliosis may develop later in life than has previously been reported and that physical therapists must become more proficient in conducting scoliosis screening programs.\r"

The model served as the framework for analysis and categorization of the professional values that evaluators emphasized during the on-site visits. The qualitative data collection methods of interview, nonparticipant observation, and document analysis were used in constructing case studies of five physical therapy education program accreditation visits. Results of this research indicated that on-site evaluators represent an elite community within the field and share similar values about the profession. These shared values about the professionalization of physical therapy formed the basis for evaluators' interpretation of accreditation standards. Evaluators' emphasis on the professional values that focus on defining and validating the body of knowledge in physical therapy and faculty endorsement of the norms of the academic work place have implications for the continued professionalization of physical therapy.\r"

The results of a multivariate analysis of variance showed that changes in blood flow during and after ES were dependent on pulse frequency but independent of stimulator type. Further analysis showed significant increases in blood flow with ES using 10, 20, and 50 pulses per second compared with 1 pulse per second. Inconsistent changes in blood pressure and heart rate were produced by ES. Based on the results of this study, effective clinical use of ES for promoting arterial blood flow to muscle would involve pulsed frequencies of 10 to 50 pulses per second.\r"

The outcome measures of interest were 1) students' score, 2) amount of time required to complete each item, and 3) amount of time required by the faculty members to grade each item. The results indicated that a greater reliability per unit of examination time was achieved for the diagnosis format than for the response set format and that the diagnosis format could be graded more rapidly and with a higher level of interrater agreement than the response set format. Students' grades on the diagnosis format items tended to be higher (although not statistically significant) than the grades on the response set format items, suggesting that when a criterion-referenced system is used, the minimal acceptable baseline score should be raised when using the diagnosis format. Further study is required to evaluate the validity of the diagnosis format.\r"

Comparison of initial and follow-up scores for the craniofacial group revealed a significant reduction in trait anxiety and trends toward reduction in parent-reported inhibited and hyperactive behavior. Scores on measures of extraversion and social functioning tended to be positively correlated with age for the comparison subjects only. Results suggest a modest improvement in psychological adjustment following surgery with a residual, possibly increasing, deficit in social functioning.\r"

Lip pressures were monitored in all groups. Significantly higher lip pressures were observed in animals with soft-tissue undermining. Cephalometric measurements were analyzed using univariate and multivariate techniques. The results of this study indicate that lip repair performed with soft-tissue undermining results in more severe craniofacial growth aberrations than lip repair performed alone.\r"

The effectiveness of the operation, as scored by standardized preoperative and postoperative evaluations, was related to age at operation, type of defect, and duration of velopharyngeal inadequacy. There was no statistical difference between those who were under the age of 6 years (100 percent were improved) at the time of the operation versus those 6 years and older (74 percent improved). Likewise, there was no difference between those patients who received an early flap (92 percent were improved) versus those who received a flap 2 or more years after initial palatorrhaphy (90 percent were improved). The type of palatal defect also was not a significant factor, and none of the patients exhibited a postoperative decrease in function (p less than or equal to 0.001). The operation offered reliable salvage of velopharyngeal competency regardless of the above-mentioned factors.\r"

During this time, the technique of raising and shaping the iliac crest has undergone a series of modifications. Initially, osteocutaneous segments based first on the superficial circumflex iliac system and later on the deep circumflex iliac system were used. More recently, only the inner table of the ilium has been employed, and where intraoral lining is required, an ulnar forearm free flap has been added. Thirty-two patients were reconstructed successfully. Of the three anastomotic failures, one bony segment was able to survive as a free graft. There were no donor-site complications. With continued experience, operative morbidity has been minimized, while the technique has been modified to tailor the reconstruction to the specific requirements of the patient. It is concluded that vascularized iliac crest provides the most appropriate mandibular reconstruction for a range of congenital and acquired defects.\r"

The rigid fixation of the head of the screw to the plate, avoiding unphysiologic loads to the bone underneath the plate, and the titanium plasma-coated perforated hollow screws, enabling the development of direct bone-titanium contact as well as the ingrowth of bone into the lumen and perforations, are the major advantages of this system compared to conventional systems. The different surgical methods, such as preservation of the condylar process with only two screws, intraoperative freely adjustable condylar prosthesis, lingual application of the plate, and primary bone transplantation, are described. The evaluation of 62 patients reconstructed with the THORP system between 1981 and 1986 revealed no plate loosening, even in irradiated bone, and showed satisfactory aesthetic and functional results.\r"

The patterns of anastomosis between the deep superior epigastric artery and the deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) were noted. Type I (29 percent) revealed a single deep superior epigastric artery and deep inferior epigastric artery, type II (57 percent) revealed a double-branched system of each vessel, and type III (14 percent) revealed a system of three or more major branches. In each case, the two systems were united by choke vessels in the segment of muscle above the umbilicus. The supply to the various transverse and vertical skin flaps from the deep superior epigastric artery was defined as a series of captured anatomic territories bounded by choke vessels. The upper transverse and vertical flaps had the best supply, and the TRAM flap had the most tenuous supply. Midline crossover occurs predominantly in the subdermal plexus and on the surface of the rectus sheath. Modifications of the design of the TRAM flap, the case for a delay procedure, the wisdom of including a strip of anterior rectus sheath, and the risks of splitting the muscle with respect to its nerve supply and vascular patterns are discussed on an anatomic basis.\r"

It appears that only about 35 percent of the mathematically expected increase in surface area takes place. Moreover, a clear difference was observed between the surface-area gain for the different shapes of tissue expanders.\r"

Complications were defined as \"absolute\" (23 of 122 expanders, 20 percent) if they resulted in loss of expanders or additional surgery or none of preoperative plan was satisfied or \"relative\" (14 of 122 expanders, 11 percent) if they included spotty alopecia or alopecia greater than 50 percent or the operative plan only partially satisfied, reflecting poor judgment. The most common absolute complication was prosthetic exposure secondary to wound dehiscence occurring in the scalp area. Complications relative to specific anatomic areas were neck and face, 2 of 20 (10 percent); lower extremity, 1 of 4 (25 percent); trunk, 0 of 6 (0 percent); and scalp, 20 of 92 (22 percent). We feel that this high complication rate in the use of tissue expanders may be unique to the pediatric burn patient. Knowledge of indications for use and potential complications is essential to add this entity to the armamentarium of the burn reconstructive surgeon.\r"

The omentum was mobilized on its gastroepiploic pedicle and brought out through a fascial defect. The molds containing the omentum were placed beneath the skin and panniculus carnosus for 4 weeks. Split-thickness skin grafts were placed on both surfaces of the mold, and a series of synthetic materials was placed within the omentum to provide structural support. When an appropriate amount of tissue had been placed within the device, omentum took on the contour of the mold. Excessive pressure associated with swelling resulted in necrosis, while an inadequate amount of tissue gave poor contour. Omentum molded without any support material rapidly lost its contour once removed from the mold. Omentum molded in combination with a synthetic material maintained its shape up to 1 month after mold removal in a limited number of animals. This model was designed to create structures with the fine detail of a prosthesis using autologous tissue. This \"prosthesis\" made from living tissue could then be transferred secondarily to its recipient area by microvascular technique.\r"

The LD50 of ischemic injury was determined by effecting 8, 10, and 12 hours of circulatory arrest. Using a 12-hour ischemic interval in this model, methylprednisolone decreased edema formation (p less than 0.01) and dramatically halted the progression of ischemic injury to necrosis (p less than 0.05) when administered within 5 hours after the onset of ischemia and continued for 3 postoperative days. A single perioperative dose of methylprednisolone was ineffective in decreasing edema formation and preserving tissue. Administration of steroids greater than 5 hours after the onset of ischemia was similarly ineffective even when administered for 3 postoperative days.\r"

We hypothesize that graft fixation will decrease movement and lead to decreased resorption. Fixed and nonfixed endochondral (rib) and membranous (skull) onlay bone grafts measuring 30 X 10 X 4 mm were grafted to the mandible bilaterally in 10 adult sheep. Fixation was achieved using the lag-screw technique. Volume measurements using caliper technique were made 20 weeks postoperatively. The volume of graft present at 20 weeks was significantly greater for the fixed bone grafts (p less than 0.001): fixed membranous, 85.9 percent; fixed endochondral, 76.2 percent; nonfixed membranous, 55 percent; and nonfixed endochondral, 16.6 percent. The results are explained using biomechanical theories related to the effects of strain. At present, it is suggested by this study that when onlay bone grafts are stabilized, improved results with respect to graft resorption can be expected.\r"

Malignant hyperthermia is usually triggered by potent inhalated anesthetics and/or depolarizing muscle relaxants. Because of the extraordinary risk of death in patients who are at risk, plastic surgeons may be reluctant to operate on these patients. Five such patients were referred to the Plastic Surgery Service and the UCLA Malignant Hyperthermia Center for anesthetic and surgical management following plastic surgical procedures aborted for first episodes of malignant hyperthermia. They were anesthetized with nitrous oxide, barbiturates, opiates, tranquilizers, and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. The patients were not treated prophylactically with dantrolene. Cardiac monitoring, end-tidal pCO2, and rectal temperatures were followed. After completion of their plastic surgical procedures, all five patients had a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy performed and subsequent caffeine/halothane contracture studies completed. The contracture study was positive in all patients studied. No anesthetic or surgical complications were encountered. This study demonstrates that patients at risk of developing malignant hyperthermia crisis can have plastic surgical procedures performed safely while undergoing appropriately selected general anesthesia.\r"

Advantages of such a device include better accuracy in determination of fat removal from each area, with improvement of symmetrical fat removal. More exact determination of blood loss with improved hemodynamic replacement is also more easily and safely accomplished. In an area of mystique, experience, artistry, and aesthetic appreciation which has cloaked the initial enthusiasm for suction lipectomy, a new generation of scientific accuracy is now possible. Thus accurate determination of aspirate content vis-a-vis fat and blood can now transform this procedure into a more sophisticated and scientifically accurate operation which traditionally is desired by most practitioners of suction lipectomy.\r"

Half of the patients with SLE had previous or current evidence of neurological involvement; an association was found between neurological disease and psychotic symptoms in SLE, while anxiety and affective disturbances appeared to be closely related to environmental factors in both patients with SLE and controls. There was no correlation between psychiatric and neurological disease and clinical or laboratory indices of disease activity.

  ".W": "A pathophysiological study of the pulmonary vasculature in 10 patients with hypoxic cor pulmonale and severe airways obstruction (five treated and five untreated with long-term oxygen) is presented. The media of muscular pulmonary arteries was normal or atrophic but, in the intima, there was active deposition of longitudinal muscle, fibrosis and elastosis. In the arterioles a medical coat of circular smooth muscle bounded by a new internal elastic lamina had developed, while there was deposition of longitudinal muscle and fibrosis in the intima. In five cases the lumen was subdivided into parallel tubes, found by serial section to lead into alveolar capillaries. These features are distinctive of hypoxaemia and obstructive airways disease. Changes continued until death. The conspicuous longitudinal muscle may be attributable to stretching of vessels round distorted terminal airways; further exploration into mechanisms is required. The hypothesis that vascular changes follow hypoxic vasoconstriction is no longer tenable. No correlations were found between quantitative pathological findings and arterial blood gas tensions, pulmonary artery pressure or haematocrit. There were no differences between patients treated or not treated with oxygen which might suggest that it arrests pathological changes. Thus, once a patient is given oxygen, survival probably depends as much on progressive mechanical changes in the lung as on continuing hypoxaemia.\r"

Two-thirds of patients presented with the triad of fever, headache and neck rigidity suggesting meningitis; seizures and mental confusion were uncommon. A high index of suspicion was essential for diagnosis particularly in immunocompromised subjects, and the diagnosis was established by positive Indian-ink preparation, culture or raised antigen titre in the cerebrospinal fluid. CT scan was helpful for diagnosis and progress monitoring. Amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine were the mainstay of treatment, and imidazole derivatives and garlic may be helpful adjuncts. Mortality was 39 per cent, but full recovery was the usual outcome in those who survived. The prognosis was worse with immunocompromised patients, and of those who died, comma and/or convulsion on admission and marked cerebral oedema and hydrocephalus on CT were notable features.\r"

Twelve live births resulted but a Downs syndrome baby died in the perinatal period. Fetal morbidity was confined to four cases of fetal growth retardation, all in mothers positive for anticardiolipin antibodies, and fetal distress in another two. There were no cases of the neonatal lupus syndrome. There was one maternal death. An obstetric history of at least two previously unexplained pregnancy failures and the presence of maternal anticardiolipin or anti-Ro antibodies accurately predicted fetal loss in six of seven cases. No other serological risk factors for fetal loss were identified. We were unable to show that suppression of antibodies in those mothers with at least two previously unexplained pregnancy failures improved fetal outcome.\r"

Among these significant factors were various measures of perceptual dysfunction, including Albert's Test. Multivariate statistical analysis which included discriminant analysis and linear logistic modelling, revealed six factors (Albert's Test Score, leg function, level of consciousness, arm power, weighted mental score and ECG changes) which were significantly and independently related to outcome. A statistical model based on these factors predicted functional outcome with an overall accuracy of 67 per cent and mortality with an accuracy of 83 per cent. This model provides a useful basis for stratification in future randomized controlled trial in stroke, and may have a role in the management of the individual stroke patient.\r"

Eleven variables were included in the assessment and were subjected to discriminant analysis, log rank test and \"survival\" analysis. The patients were observed for a considerable period (mean duration 51 months). Carbimazole (mean total dose 8 g) was given in combination with thyroxine for an average of eight months to 72 patients. Thirty-five patients relapsed and 37 remain in remission. Thyrotrophin binding inhibiting immunoglobulins (TBII) were detectable in 74 per cent of patients at diagnosis and thyroid stimulating antibodies detectable in 70 per cent. At the end of treatment thyrotrophin binding inhibiting immunoglobulins and thyroid stimulating antibodies were present in 36 and 27 per cent of patients respectively. Levels of thyrotrophin binding inhibiting immunoglobulins were significantly higher both before and after treatment in the group who relapsed, but were not of prognostic significance in an individual patient unless the value was extremely high (TBII index greater than 70). The presence of thyroid stimulating antibodies was of no value in predicting outcome. HLA typing confirmed the known association of Graves' disease with HLA B8 and HLA DR3 but neither of these antigens conferred and increased likelihood of relapse. The likelihood of relapse is shown to be directly related to the severity of the disease at the time of diagnosis, as measured by the serum total T3, and to the size of the thyroid gland; it is not affected by age, family history of thyroid disease or ophthalmopathy. The data indicate that antithyroid drug treatment can be expected to induce long-term remission in patients with mild disease (T3 less than 5 nmol/l) and small thyroids; carbimazole at this dose level is inappropriate for patients with severe disease (T3 greater than 9 nmol/) and large goitres.\r"

These changes consisted of high-intensity abnormalities on images obtained with a long repetition time (TR) and a long echo time (TE), which were initially noted 208-285 days after irradiation. These changes were associated with gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) enhancement on short TR and inversion-recovery (IR) pulse sequences. Gd-DTPA enhancement and the high intensity on the long TR/TE images were identified at the same time and became more prominent throughout the study. Chemical-shift imaging and phosphorus spectroscopy demonstrated no notable changes despite clear-cut MR evidence of abnormalities. Sodium imaging was positive in one case. Correlation of MR and pathologic findings revealed areas of radiation necrosis and wallerian degeneration that corresponded to areas of Gd-DTPA enhancement on short TR and IR images and to areas of high intensity on long TR/TE images. Peripheral to the areas of Gd-DTPA enhancement were nonenhanced zones of high-signal-intensity abnormality on long TR/TE images, which represented regions of demyelination without necrosis. Gd-DTPA-enhanced proton imaging was the most sensitive method for detecting radiation damage in this animal model.\r"

Mean follow-up was 7 months (range, 2-12 months). Stable disease in the liver was seen in ten patients, four of whom had concurrent progression of extrahepatic disease, which resulted in two deaths. Two additional deaths were not directly related to the malignant process. Progression of liver disease was found in five patients, with three deaths occurring at 7-8 months. No procedural, hematologic, or pulmonary complications occurred. Late gastroduodenal ulceration occurred at 6-8 weeks in three patients who had histories of chronic alcohol abuse. This method of therapy seems to be feasible and efficient. Caution is necessary with high doses or with patients with a history of or predisposition to gastroduodenal ulcers.\r"

The mammographic appearance (specifically, whether grouped microcalcifications, mass, or both were present) was correlated with patient age and histologic findings (specifically, whether the pathologic changes were infiltrating or noninfiltrating in nature). The prevalence of malignant conditions increased directly with age. The presence of grouped microcalcifications as the sole indicator of malignancy was seen in 100% (seven of seven) of the patients in the 30-39-year age group, 64% (18 of 28) in the 40-49-year age group, 37% (11 of 30) in the 50-59-year age group, 30% (seven of 23) in the 60-69-year age group, and 23% (six of 26) in the 70-85-year age group. Of the 49 tumors that were manifested solely as microcalcifications, 34 (69%) were noninfiltrating.

Calcium oxalate crystals were found only in malignant breast tissues. Spherical crystals (with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis response to calcium and phosphorus) contained apatite. Spherical crystals predominated in malignant processes, but all shapes and compositions were present in both benign and malignant processes. The relationship of the calcification to its surrounding tissue may account for differences in structure, but results are inconclusive and require further study.\r"

The detector has a negligible false-positive rate for the detection of clustered calcifications, although it is sensitive to clusters of emulsion defects displayed as artifactual calcification densities in the original film. The detector is flexible in structure and is easily adapted to various calcification/cluster criteria. The detector shows considerable promise when applied to clinical examples but will require refinement before formal testing.\r"

Hemorrhage in the PZ represented a problem in tumor detection and in tumor volume measurement. When multiple criteria for local tumor spread were combined, MR imaging had a sensitivity of 72%, a specificity of 84%, and an accuracy of 78% in the differentiation of stage A or B from Stage C or D disease. Assessment of seminal vesicle invasion was more accurate than assessment of direct extracapsular spread. In five patients, microscopic invasion of the capsule (stage C) was classified as stage B with MR imaging; from a clinical standpoint, this should not affect patient treatment and prognosis.

Four of seven solid tumors imaged in vivo were isointense with surrounding normal renal parenchyma at all pulse sequences. The other three tumors were hyperintense in vivo at T2-weighted sequences. At heavily T2-weighted sequences eight solid tumors were hyperintense in vitro and four were hypointense. There was no correlation between signal intensity and specific tissue type or histologic pattern for solid tumors. The five cystic tumors were well seen both in vivo and in vitro on T2-weighted images. However, the signal intensity of the cyst fluid was an unreliable indicator of benignancy. SE MR imaging at 0.35 T has significant limitations in the detection of solid renal masses.\r"

Five hundred milliliters of 2% sodium diatrizoate was given orally 45-60 minutes and 30 minutes before the study, and 250 mL was given 5-10 minutes before the study. Opacification of stomach, duodenum, and small and large bowels was graded from 0 to 3+, and the presence of pseudotumors or side effects from metoclopramide were noted. No significant difference was found in the opacification of stomach, duodenum, and jejunum between control and experimental studies. Opacification was significantly better in metoclopramide studies than control studies in the proximal ileum (P less than .05), distal ileum (P less than .05), right colon (P less than .05), and transverse colon (P less than .05). Pseudotumors were seen in 7% of control and 3% of experimental subjects. No side effects were encountered. Routine oral administration of metoclopramide before abdominal and pelvic CT examinations is recommended for rapid opacification of the ileum and proximal colon for all outpatients and for inpatients who must undergo CT on an emergency basis.\r"

The dorsal duct was depicted in all 12 patients, while the short ventral duct was seen in only five of the 12 patients. Failure of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic ducts to fuse was identified in all five patients in whom both ducts were seen. CT may not enable specific diagnosis of pancreas divisum in the majority of patients. If, however, distinct pancreatic moieties or unfused ductal systems are evident, the diagnosis may be confidently suggested.\r"

Superparamagnetic iron oxide, at a dose of 30 mumol of iron per kilogram, decreased the signal intensity of spleen from 19.5 +/- 4.8 to 3.1 +/- 2.2 (spin-echo sequence, repetition time msec/echo time msec = 1,500/42; P less than .05), without changing the signal intensity of tumor. As a result, the tumor-spleen contrast-to-noise ratio increased from 0.2 (tumor isointense relative to spleen) to 18.0 (tumor hyperintense relative to spleen). As a consequence of increased contrast, splenic tumors were detected in four of 18 patients (45 individual lesions; P less than .05), whereas nonenhanced MR imaging permitted detection of splenic lesions in only two of 18 patients (four individual lesions). Maximum tumor-spleen contrast was achieved within 60 minutes after intravenous administration. These initial clinical results indicate that MR imaging with superparamagnetic iron oxide may offer improved accuracy in the diagnosis of splenic tumors.\r"

Quantitative data did not improve the ability to distinguish hemangiomas from metastases in our series compared with qualitative analysis. Hypovascular metastases, such as colon carcinoma, could be differentiated from hemangioma more frequently (97.5%) than hypervascular endocrine metastases, such as islet cell tumor, carcinoid, and pheochromocytoma (61%). These findings indicate that the utility of MR imaging in differentiating hemangiomas from metastases is dependent on the histologic type of the primary neoplasm.\r"

Definitive surgical follow-up was obtained for 15 nonpalpable testes in 14 patients who form the basis of this study. MR imaging correctly indicated the unilateral absence of a testis in six of seven patients prospectively and all seven patients retrospectively. Surgically localized undescended testes were identified with MR imaging in five of eight cases prospectively and seven of eight cases retrospectively. Like scrotal testes, undescended testes were hypointense to fat on sequences with a short repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE) in all cases, and hyperintense or isointense to fat on long TR/TE sequences in all but two cases. Inguinal testes were located along the course of a linear low-signal-intensity structure that extended to the scrotum, which may represent the remnant of the gubernaculum testis. A low-signal-intensity band through the testis, presumably the mediastinum testis, was seen in five of the undescended testes. Although MR imaging can often be used to localize a nonpalpable testis, currently MR is not sensitive enough to allow complete exclusion of the diagnosis of an undescended testis; thus failure to localize a testis with MR imaging should not defer laparoscopy or surgical exploration when indicated.\r"

Of these, 22 had foci of increased attenuation at CT (in four patients the mean representative CT number [Hounsfied unit] was 122.2 HU [SD, 8.2 HU]), and three did not. Of the 22, 19 patients (76%) met the CT criterion of this study (there was a 12% false-positive and a 12% false-negative diagnostic rate). Six of the 19 patients and one additional patient underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and all demonstrated remarkably hypointense signal characteristics on T2-weighted images. The findings at MR imaging therefore appear more characteristic of fungal sinusitis than the findings at CT. Furnace atomic absorption spectrometry showed increased concentrations of iron and manganese in mycetoma compared with their concentrations in bacterially infected mucus. This finding and the presence of calcium in the fungal concretion may explain the hypointense T2-weighted signal on MR images.\r"

Four patterns were observed: (a) diffuse: widespread involvement of a large area; (b) patchy: localized involvement with ill-defined margins; (c) focal: well-defined areas of involvement; and (d) punctate: small foci less than 1 cm in diameter. Clinical or pathologic findings were available in 60 of the 112 patients and were correlated with the white matter patterns seen on MR images. The diffuse pattern correlated with AIDS dementia complex (ADC), which was the most common clinical diagnosis. Patchy or punctate lesions may be seen with ADC but are less common. Focal white matter lesions were not seen in patients with ADC but were seen in all six patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, in both patients with lymphoma, and in one patient with toxoplasmosis. The authors conclude that white matter lesions are are common in AIDS and are often secondary to direct infection of the brain with human immunodeficiency virus, which causes the ADC and usually produces a diffuse white matter pattern. Biopsy is probably not indicated in these patients. Focal white matter lesions suggest a focal infection or tumor, and biopsy may be warranted.\r"

All SE images with a long repetition time (TR) were obtained with first-order gradient moment nulling. GRE imaging was performed with the use of the sequential section acquisition technique called gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (GRASS), with a TR of 150 msec, an echo time of 14-17 msec, and a flip angle of 50 degrees, so to depict stationary cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as low intensity and flowing CSF as high intensity. All patent aqueducts were seen as high intensity on GRE images. In 18 of 20 obstructed aqueducts, low intensity was seen within the aqueducts on GRE images. SE images obtained with gradient moment nulling did not allow confident distinction between patent and obstructed aqueducts. It appears that GRE imaging is useful in rapidly assessing aqueductal patency.\r"

In 61 of 63 cases, gradient moment nulling was utilized to compensate for first-order flow effects. Although GRE images rapidly demonstrated flow in vascular intracranial lesions as high intensity, the vascular nature of these lesions was also clearly evident on SE images in most cases. In some cases, GRE images can be used to clarify the vascular nature of a lesion or to characterize a neoplasm. Other applications include the detection of vascular thrombosis, occult vascular malformations, and hemorrhagic complications of vascular lesions.\r"

Satisfactory postoperative seizure control was found to be strongly dependent (P less than .01) on the performance of at least partial resection of all four medial temporal lobe structures. The total amount of tissue removed did not necessarily correlate with the clinical outcome in individual cases, however, as long as some portion of all four medial structures had been resected. Two complicating factors--the presence of posterior or bilateral independent electroencephalographic foci and a history of meningoencephalitis--each negatively influenced surgical outcome (P less than .01). In cases with a complicating factor and inadequate medial resection, the outcome was invariably poor.\r"

The attenuation coefficient of the area of infarction showed a statistically significant difference in peak amplitude compared with that in the contralateral unaffected brain or with that in the control group (P less than .05). A delay in the time to peak in the affected side versus in the contralateral side was observed in six patients with stroke and ranged from 4.2 to 49.2 seconds with or without a change in peak amplitude. The clinical outcome in the patients correlated well with the initial perfusion change measured with dynamic CT scanning. The greater the difference in peak amplitude, the worse the residual neurologic defect. Patients with a prolonged time to peak (greater than 8 seconds) usually had poor clinical outcome. The whole dynamic study took 10-15 minutes more than a conventional CT study but provided more complete information as a basis for clinical treatment and an indication of clinical outcome.\r"

One of four chymopapain-treated animals developed degenerative changes in dorsal nerve roots and fibrosis in the adjacent arachnoid.

  ".W": "The authors report results of nonsurgical treatment of acute occlusion developing during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Of 514 consecutive PTCAs, acute occlusion of the dilated artery developed during or within 1 hour after PTCA in 44 patients (8.5%); of these acute occlusions, 11 (2.1%) were due to guide wire or catheter manipulation during PTCA, while 33 (6.4%) were due to abrupt closure occurring after initially successful dilation. In seven of the 11 patients with acute occlusions resulting from manipulation, PTCA was continued with attempts to cross the reoccluded segment; this was successful in two patients (29%). In 25 of the 33 patients with abrupt closure, repeat balloon dilation was immediately attempted rather than send the patients to surgery for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting. Sixteen of these 25 attempts were successful (64%) and resulted in conversion of a potential complication into a successful outcome. Abrupt closure following initial dilation seems more likely to be successfully treated by continuing with PTCA than is acute occlusion resulting from catheter and guide wire manipulation.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy and reproducibility of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the determination of left ventricular mass in humans was investigated. Left ventricular wall volume was measured from ten short-axis, end-diastolic MR images that spanned the left ventricle. Mass was estimated on the basis of average left ventricular wall volume and an assumed myocardial density. To establish the accuracy of the technique, the authors imaged ten cadaver hearts and compared true left ventricular weight with the mass estimate based on MR imaging findings. In vivo determination of left ventricular mass was evaluated in 40 subjects, with resultant calculated masses of 156.4-319.3 g. Intra- and interobserver variabilities of the technique were analyzed in ten subjects. Both the intra- (r = .96, standard error of estimate [SEE] = 11.1 g) and interobserver variabilities (r = .91, SEE = 17.8 g) were excellent. Eight subjects were imaged on two separate occasions to evaluate reproducibility of the technique and confidence limits for a given measurement. For these eight, there was good correlation between the two estimates (r = .93, SEE = 21 g). The authors conclude that MR imaging yields highly accurate and reproducible estimates of left ventricular mass in humans in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The authors describe percutaneous treatment of gallbladder or bile duct stones in 18 patients who were poor surgical candidates or in whom conventional therapy failed. Dissolution was performed in most cases with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) because of its potent dissolution properties; other solvents used included monooctanoin or chelating solutions. Gallbladder stones were eliminated in 11 of 13 patients (six of seven with dissolution alone, four of four with dissolution and basket extraction, one with basket removal alone). In five patients with stones in the common bile duct (n = 3), cystic duct remnant (n = 1), and intrahepatic bile ducts (n = 1), stones were eliminated with dissolution alone in two and with dissolution plus basket extraction in one. In two patients percutaneous therapy failed due to complications (vagal hypotension with bile peritonitis and transient respiratory arrest) that occurred during catheter placement. Preliminary results suggest that MTBE is effective for dissolution of many gallbladder stones and some bile duct stones. Noncholesterol solvents and adjuvant mechanical maneuvers are valuable adjuncts to achieve complete stone elimination.\r"

An additional 11 patients did not undergo embolization due to unfavorable vascular anatomy or lack of significant symptoms. Permanent occlusive agents including isobutyl cyanoacrylate, particles of polyvinyl alcohol foam, and coils were used to embolize the multiple feeding vessels and, when possible, the nidus of the AVM. All patients experienced dramatic reduction in pain and resolution of ulceration and bleeding, with a mean follow-up period of 41 months. Symptoms recurred in four patients but again resolved with repeat embolization. The authors conclude that selective and repetitive embolization is highly effective in palliation of symptomatic congenital AVMs.\r"

Large segmental areas of low signal intensity were observed on T1-weighted images when the lesion consisted of necrotic bone with amorphous marrow debris and adjacent thickened trabecular bone with mesenchymal repair tissue infiltration. On intermediate-weighted images, however, mesenchymal repair tissue, which was located inferior to the necrotic zone, increased markedly in signal intensity, permitting distinction from low-intensity necrotic bone with amorphous marrow debris. When trabecular thickening with collapse predominated, segmental areas of low signal intensity with both sequences were found. MR signal intensities used in combination with anatomic configuration and location may provide information of potential therapeutic importance regarding tissue composition and stage of disease.\r"

In seven cases, cortical metastases developed in patients with a known primary tumor. The primary tumors involved were eight renal cell carcinomas, six bronchogenic carcinomas, two carcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract, one osteosarcoma, one neuroblastoma, one melanoma, one hepatoma, one carcinoma of the breast, and one thyroid carcinoma. In four cases, the primary tumor remained unknown. A metastatic origin should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an osteolytic lesion arising in the cortex of a long bone, especially in older patients and in patients with a known primary malignant condition. The cortical bone metastases encountered in this study did not originate solely from bronchogenic carcinoma, as has been reported by other authors. Cortical metastases are probably less rare than has been hitherto assumed.\r"

Seven episodes of facial bone infarcts--four orbital, two mandibular, and one in the zygomatic arch--in six patients encountered at the authors' institution are reported. Five patients had hemoglobin SS, and one had hemoglobin SC. Bone marrow scans were positive for infarction in five of the six episodes during which they were obtained, which highlights the usefulness of this technique in the diagnosis of facial bone infarction.\r"

Ten patients were imaged with ear protection, and only one experienced any hearing loss. Therefore, the noise generated by MR imagers may cause temporary hearing loss, and earplugs can prevent this loss. All threshold changes had returned to within 10 dB of baseline by 15 minutes after completion of the second audiometric test.\r"

CSF signal intensity was consistently greater than that of iophendylate. Therefore, retained intraspinal iophendylate may be considered in the differential diagnosis of focal areas of low signal intensity at the periphery of the spinal canal on GRASS images. At constant TE and TR, an increase in alpha from 6 degrees to 45 degrees increased the signal intensities of CSF and iophendylate but decreased CSF-iophendylate contrast. At constant alpha and TR, an increase in TE from 13 to 28 msec decreased the signal intensities of CSF and iophendylate but increased contrast. At constant alpha and TE, an increase in TR from 50 to 400 msec increased the signal intensities of CSF and iophendylate, as well as contrast. Clinical examples of the contrast behavior of retained intraspinal iophendylate on both spin-echo and GRASS images corroborate the experimental findings. Retained intraspinal iophendylate may mimic the appearance of intra-or extra-dural lesions, magnetic susceptibility artifact, and flow on gradient-echo MR images of the spine.\r"

Multiple regression analysis, conducted to investigate the suitability of relaxation time as a model of estimating muscle fiber composition, revealed that T1 and T2 were significantly related to muscle fiber composition. These results indicate that MR relaxation time may be used to estimate muscle fiber composition.\r"

These results support the model that H-DNA is a structure containing both triple-stranded and single-stranded regions. The stability of this structure was affected by both pH and the degree of negative supercoiling: at pH 7.6 to 7.7, a high level of supercoiling was needed to keep about half of the molecules in the H conformation; at pH 6 and pH 5, normal levels of supercoiling supported H-DNA; and at pH 4, no supercoiling was required. At mildly alkaline pH, the TC/AG18 repeat assumed a novel conformation called J-DNA that differed from both the B and H forms. A three-dimensional model for the structure of H-DNA is proposed that accounts both for the single-strandedness of the nucleotides and for the influence of supercoiling on H-DNA formation. This model predicts and evidence is presented that H-DNA introduces a sharp kink in the DNA. Moreover, the angle of this kink appears not to be fixed, so that H-DNA is also a hinged-DNA.\r"

The majority of RB tumors do not show gross alterations in a 4.7-kb fragment (4.7R), which is a candidate RB1 gene. To search for more subtle mutations, the ribonuclease protection method was used to analyze 4.7R messenger RNA from RB tumors. Five of 11 RB tumors, which exhibit normal 4.7R DNA and normal-sized RNA transcripts, showed abnormal ribonuclease cleavage patterns. Three of the five mutations affected the same region of the messenger RNA, consistent with an effect on splicing involving an as yet unidentified 5' exon. The high frequency of mutations in 4.7R supports the identification of 4.7R as the RB1 gene. However, the unusual nature of some of the abnormalities of 4.7 R alleles indicates that the accepted sequence of genetic events involved in the genesis of RB may require reevaluation.\r"

These problems have now been overcome by the development of a preparation in which presynaptic vesicle-containing boutons have been coisolated with the soma of individual neurons, thus providing the opportunity to study synaptic currents under conditions of both adequate voltage control and internal ionic perfusion. Spontaneous synaptic currents mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid and excitatory amino acids were recorded from neurons isolated from a mammalian medial solitary tract nucleus. Calcium- and depolarization-dependent spontaneous currents of several to hundreds of picoamperes occurred with rapid rise times of 0.8 to 3 milliseconds and decays at least ten times as long.\r"

Human carcinoma cells that maintained high levels of metallothionein because of chronic exposure to heavy metals were resistant to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), melphalan, and chlorambucil. Furthermore, cells transfected with bovine papilloma virus expression vectors containing DNA encoding human metallothionein-IIA were resistant to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), melphalan, and chlorambucil but not to 5-fluorouracil or vincristine. Thus, overexpression of metallothionein represents one mechanism of resistance to a subset of clinically important anticancer drugs.\r"

To determine if a similar increase in stress tolerance could be elicited in vivo, rats were made hyperthermic, and then their retinas were tested for sensitivity to light damage. This treatment resulted in a marked decrease in photoreceptor degeneration after exposure to bright light as compared to normothermic animals. Concomitant with such protection was an increase in retinal synthesis of three heat shock proteins. Thus, a physiological rise in body temperature enhances the stress tolerance of nerve tissue, perhaps by increasing heat shock protein production.\r"

Transcripts for platelet-derived growth factor A chain (PDGF-A), transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, and TGF-beta 1, but not for four other growth factors, were found in whole blastocysts. TGF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, and PDGF antigens were detected in blastocysts by immunocytochemistry. Both PDGF-A and TGF-alpha were detected as maternal transcripts in the unfertilized ovulated oocyte, and again in blastocysts. TGF-beta 1 transcripts appeared only after fertilization. The expression of a subset of growth factors in mouse blastocysts suggests a role for these factors in the growth and differentiation of early mammalian embryos.\r"

Instituting the low sodium diet at embryonic day 10 or later did not produce functional changes. Thus, a sensitive period for the gustatory system exists, and the abrupt transition from maximal environmental susceptibility to no susceptibility occurs during a 2-day prenatal period. Moreover, events important in determining the developmental fate of taste membrane components occur before the initial formation of taste buds.\r"

In contrast, modulation of the calcium current (ICa) by 8-CPT cAMP was independent of temperature with similar increases in ICa occurring at both temperatures. Stimulation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate also enhanced IK in a temperature-dependent manner but failed to increase ICa at either temperature. Thus, cardiac delayed-rectifier potassium but not calcium channels are regulated by two distinct protein kinases in a similar temperature-dependent fashion.\r"

Specific 125I-labeled melatonin binding was consistently found in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of hypothalami from adults and fetuses. Densitometric analysis of competition experiments with varying concentrations of melatonin showed monophasic competition curves, with comparable half-maximal inhibition values for the suprachiasmatic nuclei of adults (150 picomolar) and fetuses (110 picomolar). Micromolar concentrations of the melatonin agonist 6-chloromelatonin completely inhibited specific 125I-labeled melatonin binding, whereas the same concentrations of serotonin and norepinephrine caused only a partial reduction in specific binding. The results suggest that putative melatonin receptors are located in a human biological clock.\r"

Long-term potentiation (LTP) of the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse was blocked by muscarine. Low concentrations of muscarine (1 micromolar) had little effect on low-frequency (0.2 hertz) synaptic stimulation but did significantly reduce the magnitude and probability of induction of LTP. Experiments under voltage clamp showed that muscarine blocked the increase in excitatory synaptic conductance normally associated with LTP at this synapse.

The involvement of spontaneously generated action potential activity in the process of segregation was investigated during the fetal period in which segregation normally occurs in the cat, between embryonic day 45 (E45) and birth (E65). Tetrodotoxin, which blocks the voltage-sensitive sodium channel, was used to prevent action potentials. Fetuses received continuous intracranial infusions of tetrodotoxin from osmotic minipumps implanted in utero on E42. After a 2-week infusion, intraocular injections of anterograde tracers revealed that tetrodotoxin prevented segregation. The contralateral projection filled the lateral geniculate nucleus uniformly, and the ipsilateral projection expanded to occupy most of what would normally be contralaterally innervated layer A. Thus, in the fetus, long before the onset of vision, spontaneous action potential activity is likely to be present in the visual system and to contribute to the segregation of the retinogeniculate pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Adhesion of blood cells to endothelial cells is an essential component of all inflammatory responses. The capacity of the endothelium to support adhesion of neutrophils is increased by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, and endotoxin. Another cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), was a strong inhibitor of basalneutrophil adhesion and also decreased the adhesive response of endothelial cells to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The ability of cells to respond to TGF-beta was related to the duration of culture of endothelial cells after explantation from umbilical veins. TGF-beta is likely to serve an anti-inflammatory role at sites of blood vessel injury undergoing active endothelial regeneration.\r"

The purified ryanodine receptor channel has now been shown to have four properties usually associated with gap junction channels: (i) a large nonspecific voltage-dependent conductance consisting of several open states; (ii) an inhibition of open probability by low pH; (iii) an inhibition of open probability by calcium; and (iv) a sensitivity to blockade by heptanol and octanol but not other alcohols. This functional homology may provide an insight into the mechanism of how muscle cells transduce depolarization into an intracellular release of calcium.\r"

These changes include homozygous internal deletions and total deletion of RB1; a duplication of an exon was observed in one of the cell lines. In all cases, structural changes either resulted in the absence or truncation of the RB1 transcript. No obvious defect in RB1 was detected by DNA blot analysis in primary tumors or cell lines from Wilms' tumor, cervical carcinoma, or hepatoma. These results further support the concept that the human RB1 gene has pleiotropic effects on specific types of cancer.\r"

Studies with animals suggest that acetaldehyde, the primary hepatic oxidative metabolite of ethanol, may contribute to fetal damage. It is not known, however, whether acetaldehyde reaches the human fetus, either by placental production or transfer. Studies utilizing the perfused human placental cotyledon show that the human placenta oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde, releasing it into the fetal perfusate. Moreover, when acetaldehyde is present in the maternal perfusate, it is transferred to the fetal side, reaching approximately 50 percent of the maternal level. These findings suggest that the human placenta may play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of ethanol-associated fetal injury.\r"

PTH-LP messenger RNA is expressed in mammary tissue only during lactation; it appears and disappears rapidly (2 to 4 hours) as a function of the sucking stimulus. The identity of this messenger RNA was confirmed by cloning the rat PTH-LP complementary DNA, which predicts a peptide with strong similarity to the human homolog. Moreover, extracts from lactating mammary tissue stimulated parathyroid hormone-dependent adenylate cyclase. These findings suggest that PTH-LP plays a physiological role in lactation, possibly as a hormone for the mobilization or transfer (or both) of calcium to the milk.\r"

Polyclonal antisera to fusion proteins containing the MyoD1 sequence show that MyoD1 is a phosphoprotein present in the nuclei of proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes but not expressed in 10T1/2 fibroblasts or other nonmuscle cell types. Functional domains of the MyoD1 protein were analyzed by site-directed deletional mutagenesis of the MyoD1 cDNA. Deletion of a highly basic region (residues 102 to 135) interferes with both nuclear localization and induction of myogenesis. Deletion of a short region (residues 143 to 162) that is similar to a conserved region in the c-Myc family of proteins eliminates the ability of the MyoD1 protein to initiate myogenesis but does not alter nuclear localization. Deletions of regions spanning the remainder of MyoD1 did not affect nuclear localization and did not inhibit myogenesis. Furthermore, expression of only 68 amino acids of MyoD1, containing the basic and the Myc similarity domains, is sufficient to activate myogenesis in stably transfected 10T1/2 cells. Genetic analysis maps the MyoD1 gene to mouse chromosome 7 and human chromosome 11.\r"

The power law of practice states that the speed of performance of a task will improve as a power of the number of times that the task is performed. The power law resulting from two sorts of problem-solving changes, addition of operators to the problem-space graph and alterations in the decision procedure used to decide which operator to apply at a particular state, is empirically demonstrated. The model provides an analytic account for both of these sources of the power law. The model also predicts a problem-solving fan-effect, slowdown during practice caused by an increase in the difficulty of making useful decisions between possible paths, which is also found empirically.\r"

These AIDS-KS cells were similar to the so-called spindle cells in KS lesions and had some of their features. They produced factors that supported their own growth (autocrine) and the growth of other cells (paracrine), including umbilical vein endothelium and fibroblasts. That the AIDS-KS cells also expressed potent angiogenic activity was demonstrated by the chorioallantoic membrane assay and by subcutaneous inoculation of AIDS-KS cells into nude mice, which resulted in the development of angiogenic lesions composed of mouse cells and showing histological features similar to those of human KS lesions. These data suggest that AIDS-associated KS and possibly other types of KS may be initiated by signals that induce the growth of particular cells (spindle cells of lymphatic or vascular origin) and the expression of autocrine and paracrine activities.\r"

Although correlative evidence suggests that these proteins play a role in enhancing survival during and after stress, there is no direct evidence to support this in mammalian cells. To assess the role of the most highly conserved heat shock protein (hsp) family during heat shock, affinity-purified monoclonal antibodies to hsp70 were introduced into fibroblasts by needle microinjection. In addition to impairing the heat-induced translocation of hsp70 proteins into the nucleus after mild heat shock treatment, injected cells were unable to survive a brief incubation at 45 degrees C. Cells injected with control antibodies survived a similar heat shock. These results indicate that functional hsp70 is required for survival of these cells during and after thermal stress.\r"

Most \"family\" homicides are spousal homicides, fueled by male sexual proprietariness. In the case of parent-offspring conflict, an evolutionary model predicts variations in the risk of violence as a function of the ages, sexes, and other characteristics of protagonists, and these predictions are upheld in tests with data on infanticides, parricides, and filicides.\r"

GABA-sensitive chloride channels were detected several days after injection with any one of three different alpha RNAs (alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3) or with beta RNA. The channels induced by each of the alpha-subunit RNAs were indistinguishable, they had multiple conductance levels (10, 19, 28, and 42 picosiemens), and their activity was potentiated by pentobarbital and inhibited by picrotoxin. The beta channels usually expressed poorly but showed similar single channel conductance levels (10, 18, 27, and 40 picosiemens), potentiation by pentobarbital and inhibition by picrotoxin. The finding that both alpha and beta subunits, examined separately, form GABA-sensitive ion channels with permeation properties and regulatory sites characteristic of the native receptor suggests that the amino acid sequences that confer these properties are within the homologous domains shared by the subunits.\r"

  ".W": "Monocytes and macrophages, which may play a central role in the pathogenesis of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), express the CD4 molecule and Fc receptors (FcR) for immunoglobulin G (IgG). To explore the possibility that FcR mediate HIV-1 infection of monocytes, studies were conducted with the human monocytic cell line U937. These cells were exposed to HIV-1 complexed with various concentrations of serum from HIV-1 antibody-positive individuals and monitored for HIV-1 replication. Serum samples from antibody-negative normal individuals did not affect virus yields. High concentrations of antibody-positive sera showed virus-neutralizing activity; however, cells infected with HIV-1 in the presence of antibody-positive sera at subneutralizing concentrations significantly enhanced virus replication. This infection enhancement was blocked by heat-aggregated gamma-globulin. Moreover, the IgG fraction from an HIV-1 antibody-positive serum enhanced HIV-1 infection at the same serum dilution equivalents. In contrast, IgG-F(ab')2 did not enhance HIV-1 infection but showed neutralizing activity with HIV-1. These results are compatible with the concept of FcR-mediated infection enhancement and suggest that this immunological response to HIV-1, instead of protecting the host, potentially facilitates the infection.\r"

Such receptors are found in physiological mineralocorticoid target tissues (kidney, parotid, and colon) and in nontarget tissues such as hippocampus and heart. In mineralocorticoid target tissues the receptors are selective for aldosterone in vivo because of the presence of the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase, which converts cortisol and corticosterone, but not aldosterone, to their 11-keto analogs. These analogs cannot bind to mineralocorticoid receptors.\r"

Patients who had open reduction and internal fixation had a significantly shorter hospitalization, a shorter confinement to bed, a shorter time to full weight-bearing, and fewer early complications. In addition, on intermediate follow-up, these patients had less back and leg pain and fewer gait disturbances, and were more likely to be able to do heavy work.

Presently, computerized tomography (CT) of the chest can diagnose the majority of mediastinal cysts, based on their smooth contour and low density; however, CT diagnosis of a mediastinal cyst based on density can be erroneous. In six patients, we established the diagnosis of mediastinal cyst by percutaneous needle biopsy (PNB) without complication. In four of the patients, PNB was done as an outpatient procedure. Follow-up in five patients ranged from three months to three years, with no increase in the size of the cyst; in the sixth patient, surgical excision showed a hygroma. Thus, diagnosis of a mediastinal cyst can be safely confirmed by PNB. We suggest that these asymptomatic patients can be followed up without the need for surgical excision.\r"

High positive predictive values (88% for at least one abnormal LFT) make the evaluation of positive urine screens detected during routine health care maintenance examinations imperative. Because extraneous factors may influence both urine and serum test results, however, urine assays obtained as a screening parameter in clinical presentations (abdominal pain, jaundice, constitutional symptoms, etc) have only limited clinical utility. The high proportion of false-negative results for both urine assays renders their statistical properties unacceptable as screens in these clinical situations.\r"

In 12 patients (11%) laparotomy showed the volvulus at the terminal ileum and cecum. The presenting symptoms in this group were distention in ten (83%), pain in seven (58%), obstipation or constipation in two (17%), and diarrhea in one (8%). Diagnosis was achieved by plain abdominal films in five (45%); barium enema was obtained in six patients and was diagnostic in five (83%). Two patients had delay in diagnosis with subsequent gangrene of cecum; one of them died. No deaths occurred in the group with viable bowel. Treatment was by simple detorsion without fixation in two (17%), detorsion with cecopexy in two (17%), tube cecostomy in three (25%), and ileocolectomy in three (25%). Simple detorsion was not followed by recurrence of the volvulus in any case in this series. Cecopexy for viable colon and ileocolectomy for gangrenous colon appeared to have the lowest rates of complications.\r"

Cardiovascular parameters measured with noninvasive oscillometry and transthoracic impedance plethysmography remained unchanged after administration of ketamine. Excellent analgesia and a calm anesthetic recovery were produced, without detectable cardiovascular depression. When ketamine and halothane are administered in combination, careful restriction of dosages of these agents is recommended. Interaction of higher doses of ketamine and halothane has been reported to produce hypotension and bradycardia, which can be avoided with use of subdissociative, analgesic doses of ketamine during light halothane maintenance before emergence. After halothane anesthesia in healthy children, ketamine may be considered a suitable alternative to narcotics for postoperative analgesia.\r"

We have described a patient in whom an additional potentiating influence on warfarin effect was observed during treatment with rifampin and isoniazid. After cessation of rifampin and isoniazid, prothrombin time was maintained within the same range by a 50% reduction of warfarin doses, despite a twofold rise in the plasma warfarin concentration. This rise in warfarin concentrations can be explained by the known mechanism by which rifampin increases warfarin clearance. After cessation of rifampin, warfarin fractional clearance decreased from 15.2 to 4.2 ml/min; however, the unchanged prothrombin time in the face of the increased warfarin concentration can be explained only by the removal of a potentiating effect that had been present during the coadministration of rifampin and isoniazid. It is likely that rifampin is responsible for this additional potentiating interaction, probably not through a change in warfarin binding, but through a differential effect on warfarin stereoisomer metabolism or through an altered dynamic effect. The role of isoniazid in this interaction cannot be completely ruled out.\r"

All cases in group A were treated conservatively by a plaster cast or a neck brace, and achieved bony union in 6 to 27 weeks. Five of 24 fractures in group B, treated conservatively, failed to unite. Nineteen cases of Type II and six cases of Type III were treated surgically. Transoral fusion was performed in six cases, internal fixation using a compression screw in ten, bone peg fixation in one, posterior fusion in eight, and posterior decompression in one. Two cases treated with transoral fusion and two with screw fixation failed to unite. We recommend conservative treatment of group A patients, Type I, and acute cases of Type III with minimal displacement in group B. Surgery should be performed in acute cases of Type II, Type III with significant displacement, and nonunion cases in Type II and Type III.\r"

Two major groups of patients were those with neck pain and headache stemming from the C2-3 joints, and those with neck pain and shoulder pain stemming from the C5-6 joints. Internal-control observations in nine of the 17 patients established the diagnostic validity of the blocks used. The high yield of positive responders in this study probably reflects the propensity of patients with zygapophysial joint syndromes to gravitate to a pain clinic when this condition is not recognised in conventional clinical practice.\r"

Myelography and computed tomography-myelography showed multisegmental lesions (average: 3.0 lesions), that contributed to the various clinical features of myelopathy. The upper disc levels of C3-4 and C4-5 had a tendency to be involved in the aged patients, and the spinal cords were extensively compressed as compared with the younger patients. Disc protrusion, posterior osteophyte, and retrolisthesis, in addition to ligamentous entrapments were the primary etiologic factors of myelopathy. Morphologically, the high prevalence of cord atrophy was seen on computed tomography-myelography in the aged patients. This indicated severe pathologic changes in the cervical spinal cord, and its prognosis was considered to be poor.\r"

The following parameters were statistically evaluated by multiple regression analysis: age, sex, curve location, number of vertebrae in curve, Cobb angle, maturity (Risser sign, menarche), curve flexibility, and hours in the jacket. The overall success rate was 81%, and onset of menarche and Risser sign were statistically significant prognostic variables. Ten patients (10%) underwent posterior spinal fusion for curve progression. Bracing with an underarm scoliosis jacket is a successful method of treatment of idiopathic scoliosis in the immature spine. We do not recommend brace treatment for postmenarchal patients or patients with a Risser sign of Grade 1 or greater until curve progression has been observed. Furthermore, the Wilmington jacket appears to give similar results for part-time brace wearers.\r"

The injury can be caused by either flexion distraction (29/30 cases) or by pure distraction (1/30). Recognition of the injury is possible on plain radiographs, and confirmed by the empty facet sign on the computed tomography (CT) scan. In contradistinction to other major spine injuries, the majority of patients present with complete neurologic lesions (21/30). Recovery of patients with incomplete lesions is frequent (5/6); however, recovery from complete lesions did not occur. Compression instrumentation is recommended for patients with complete lesions because it is stable and requires no external immobilization. Distraction instrumentation that imparts significant extension is advised for patients with incomplete lesions. It is safe and reliable, and eliminates the posterior bulging of the injured disc that can occur with compression. For low lumbar injuries where compression is desirable in order to achieve the shortest possible instrumentation, a discectomy is recommended.\r"

There was no statistical difference in outcome between these two groups. Positive correlations were found between the level of injury and Frankel grades. The cord lesions tended to demonstrate more severe neurological deficit, whereas the cauda equina lesions were associated with a lesser severity of neurologic deficit. A component of dislocation to the injury also resulted in a more severe neurological deficit. There was no apparent difference between the degree of bony encroachment of the spinal canal and the initial Frankel grade, nor was there a clear difference between those patients undergoing anterior versus posterior surgery.\r"

Following the appearance of these lesions, peripheral proliferation of hyaline cartilage appeared that eventually bridged adjacent vertebral bodies, calcified, and was replaced with bone. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the progressive ankylosis mouse has a disorder affecting mineralization. Although it does not exactly resemble any known human disorder, it should be an important model for studying both crystal deposition and abnormal mineralization of hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage since many vertebral ankylosis disorders, as well as the normal aging process, involve increased mineralization.\r"

Most models that describe the activity of these internal components are static and do not consider the time series of events that occurs during performance of a task under dynamic conditions. This research has investigated the time sequence activity of ten trunk muscles and intra-abdominal pressure in ten males as they produced sagittally symmetric maximum trunk extension motions (lifting motions) at different velocities. These exertions include an isometric exertion and isokinetic exertions equal to 25, 50, 75 and 100% of a subject's maximum extension velocity. Several event times were noted for each internal trunk-loading component, and hypothesis tests were performed to determine which of these event times were statistically different from each other under the various motion conditions. This information was used to construct networks of internal trunk-loading activities under the various motion conditions. Time-series events that occur under all conditions, as well as those that changed as a function of velocity, have been identified. This information will be useful for the construction of dynamic internal trunk models, and will facilitate the assessment of dynamic loading of the lumbar spine in the workplace.\r"

  ".W": "The degenerative changes of the lumbar spine in 100 patients with symptomatic low-back pain were reviewed using plain roentgenograms and computed tomographic scans in order to determine the relationship between degeneration and annular protrusion. Additionally, the lumbar spinal units of 25 fresh cadavers were roentgenographed, injected with a mixture of methylene blue and renografin-60, dissected, and studied. The state of degeneration of each of the intervertebral units of both groups was graded on a four-point scale based on the roentgenographic presence or absence of osteophytes and facet joint changes, and the intervertebral disc height. The degree of annular protrusion was measured by dividing the anteroposterior diameter of the intervertebral disc by the anteroposterior diameter of the vertebral plate as determined on the radiographic studies. In the clinical group, 39 intervertebral discs having Grade II and III degeneration exhibited a statistically higher annular/vertebral diameter ratio (A/V index) of 1.30 as compared to the normal invertebral discs, with an A/V index of 1.12 (P less than 0.001). The dissection of the disc spaces of the cadavers with radiographic evidence of disc space narrowing and marginal osteophytosis, Grade II and III degeneration, displayed significant interruption and tearing of the annular fibers and peripheral migration of collagenized nuclear fragments. In both the clinical and pathologic groups, there was a direct correlation between the size of the annular bulge, as indicated in the A/V index, and the degree of narrowing of the disc space. Therefore, this study indicated that annular protrusion is an intricate part of the degeneration process.\r"
