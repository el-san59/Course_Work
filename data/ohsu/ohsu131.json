The use of pulmonary artery catheter data demonstrates that optimal therapeutic goals can be estimated and basic pathophysiologic abnormalities can be discovered.\r"

  ".W": "Head injury is a common occurrence in the multiply injured patient. Because it is so common, physicians in busy emergency rooms should be well versed in its evaluation and treatment. A guide to appropriate evaluation and treatment has been established by Becker et al. Patients can be divided into four categories, depending on degree of neurologic injury. Group I patients suffer transient loss of consciousness only and then return to normal; they require observation only. Group II patients suffer loss of consciousness and continue to have impaired cognitive functions; they require observation and a CT scan. Group III patients suffer loss of consciousness, continue to have disordered cognitive functions, and have significant motor deficits. This group can be subdivided into patients with and without focal neurologic deficits. Both of these will require aggressive therapy to control intracranial hypertension, CT scanning, and possibly surgery. The last category, group IV, includes patients who meet the requirements of brain death. No further work-up or therapy is needed for this group. Patients who suffer head injury are at risk for many complications, but two that are emphasized are postconcussion seizures and the postconcussion syndrome. Identifying factors that predispose the patient to these complications can help to minimize their occurrence.\r"

  ".U": "87053541\r", 
  ".W": "High affinity (Ca2+ + Mg2+)ATPase activity was demonstrated in proximal tubule basolateral membranes (BLM) obtained from canine kidney. The Km of the enzyme for free Ca2+ was 0.12 +/- 0.02 microM, and at 3 microM free Ca2+, the enzyme reached its maximal velocity. To evaluate hormonal regulation of this enzyme, we studied the in vitro effects of several polypeptide hormones on enzyme activity. We measured the effects of insulin and human (h) PTH-(1-34) and their inactive analogs desoctapeptide insulin, bovine (b) PTH-(3-34), and oxidized hPTH-(1-34); insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) I and II; calcitonin; and the common cellular mediator for PTH and calcitonin, cAMP. At 0.1 microM free Ca2+, insulin (25-100 microU/ml) increased (Ca2+ + Mg2+)ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner by 35-52% (P less than 0.01) and by 8-13% (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.01) at a 3-microM free Ca2+ concentration; hPTH-(1-34) PTH (10(-9)-10(-7) M) increased the enzyme activity at a free Ca2+ concentration of 0.1 microM by 13-25% (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.01). IGF-I increased (Ca2+ + Mg2+)ATPase activity by 40% (P less than 0.05) at 0.1 microM free Ca2+ at high peptide concentrations (10 ng/ml). No effect was obtained at 2 ng/ml IGF-I. cAMP (10(-7)-10(-4) M) stimulated enzyme activity by 18-27% (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.02) at 0.1 microM Ca2+ and by 8-12% (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.01) at 3 microM Ca2+. The effects of insulin and cAMP on (Ca2+ + Mg2+)ATPase activity were additive. No effect on the enzyme activity was obtained by the inactive analogs desoctapeptide insulin, bPTH-(3-34), and oxidized hPTH-(1-34), or by calcitonin or IGF-II. The data suggest that insulin and PTH have a specific stimulatory effect on (Ca2+ + Mg2+)ATPase activity in canine kidney proximal tubular BLM. While the insulin action is independent of cAMP, a role of cAMP in the regulatory effect of PTH on this enzyme cannot be ruled out. The direct stimulatory effect of insulin and PTH on (Ca2+ + Mg2+)ATPase in canine kidney proximal tubular BLM suggests that these hormones mediate their cellular effects in part by changes in cellular calcium homeostasis.\r"

LH was measured in adult ovariectomized (OVX) rats before and after acute LHRH administration, with or without estradiol benzoate (Eb) treatment (10 micrograms, 48 and 24 h before experiments). I-LH and B-LH were measured in the same samples by RIA and the rat interstitial cell testosterone assay, respectively. OVX diabetic animals showed a significant reduction in both I-LH (63%) and B-LH (73%). Treatment with Eb induced a decrease in basal I-LH and B-LH levels in all experimental groups (50%). These values were normalized after insulin therapy. No alterations in the pituitary responsiveness to LHRH were detected when I-LH levels were determined. However, B-LH levels assayed after LHRH stimulation were significantly decreased in diabetic animals. Insulin treatment was unable to restore this response. The effect of Eb treatment on these parameters was also tested. In these conditions LHRH injections induced similar increases in serum I-LH and B-LH in both diabetic and control rats. These results indicate that, in diabetic OVX rats, basal and LHRH-induced LH has a reduced bioactivity, but this reduction is reversed by Eb treatment. This might indicate that the major defect lies in the ovary rather than at the pituitary level, supporting the notion of an important role of the steroid milieu on the B-LH modulation.\r"

  ".W": "The amino acids L-leucine, L-isoleucine, and L-arginine require a subthreshold concentration of glucose to elicit insulin release and electrical activity from B-cells. There is evidence suggesting that protons couple the metabolism of glucose to the functional response of B-cells. In view of this, a permeable weak acid, sulfamerazine, was used to determine if the generation of intracellular protons could account for the permissive action of glucose. Addition of 10 mM sulfamerazine elicited constant spike activity only with 20 mM leucine. With 20 mM arginine or isoleucine, sulfamerazine induced silent depolarization no different from that caused by sulfamerazine alone. The pattern of the electrical activity of each amino acid plus 5.6 mM glucose or alpha-ketoisocaproic acid alone was qualitatively different; addition of sulfamerazine enhanced the electrical response. The permeable weak base NH4Cl at 20 mM immediately inhibited the electrical response to each amino acid plus glucose or alpha-ketoisocaproic acid alone. The effects of the permeable weak acid and base indicate that intracellular pH is important in maintaining amino acid-induced electrical activity. The permissive role of glucose may be due to provision of protons only with leucine.\r"

  ".U": "87053548\r", 
  ".W": "Because endogenous opioid peptides (EOP) and CRF are activated during stress and decrease LH levels when injected centrally, we have explored the roles of these peptides in the stress-induced inhibition of LH secretion. Three opioid peptide systems [i.e. endorphin (END), enkephalin, dynorphin (DYN)], are present in the hypothalamus, acting on different opiate receptor subtypes (i.e. mu, delta, kappa). We first evaluated which EOP might be involved in the stress-induced decrease of LH levels. Immunoneutralization of EOP and pharmacological blockade of opiate receptors were used to reverse the decrease in LH induced by inescapable intermittent footshock in castrated male rats. Anti-beta-END and anti-DYN-A serum (intracerebroventricularly [icv]) or pretreatment with beta-END antagonist, beta-human END-(6-31) (2 and 5 nmol, icv), or with kappa-antagonists, Mr1452 MS and Mr2266 BS (10 mg/kg BW, ip), reversed electroshock-induced decrease in LH concentrations. beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA), an irreversible mu 1-opiate receptor antagonist, was partially effective in blocking the inhibitory effect of stress on LH levels. Neither passive immunization with anti-enkephalin nor the pretreatment with the delta-opiate receptor antagonist, ICI 154,129, (10 and 100 nmol, icv) modified the effect of stress. We then evaluated which endogenous opioid ligands and/or receptors might mediate the inhibitory effect on LH levels of 2 nmol ovine CRF injected icv. Anti-beta-END serum and beta-human END-(6-31), reversed the CRF-induced decrease of LH concentrations, whereas beta-FNA was only partially active. Anti-DYN-A and anti-ENK serum, kappa- and delta-antagonists did not prevent the decline of LH levels in rats receiving CRF centrally. These data suggest that stress-induced inhibition of LH secretion involves the stimulation of beta-END and DYN-A systems via mu/epsilon- or kappa-opiate receptors and that the decrease in circulating LH levels induced by centrally administered CRF may be mediated by the activation of beta-END system. Therefore, it is possible that the activation of the central CRF/beta-END pathway may play an important role in the stress-induced inhibition of reproductive functions.\r"

DNA synthesis was not affected by the steroid hormones, as was evident from the rate of incorporation of 32P into total DNA. Decreased incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA found in islets treated with either of these steroids seemed to reflect an inhibitory effect of these hormones on thymidine kinase, leading to decreased phosphorylation of labeled thymidine. In addition, the hormones stimulated the activity of thymidylate synthetase, thus enhancing the endogenous synthesis of thymidine and thereby diluting the specific activity of the [3H]thymidine added to the cultured islets. Further support for a lack of inhibition of growth of islet cells treated with steroid hormones was provided by the observation that prednisolone increased uridine kinase activity and RNA biosynthesis, both of which may participate in the growth of cells preceding mitosis and (the latter) in protein hormone biosynthesis.\r"

  ".W": "An important role for calcium in the cellular events leading to insulin secretion is supported by many studies. However, simultaneous measurements of changes in intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations [( Ca2+]i) and insulin release in response to secretagogues have not been performed. Using cells isolated from a glucose-responsive insulinoma, changes in [Ca2+]i were measured with the fluorescent calcium probe quin2. With the nutrient secretagogues glucose (30 mM) and D,L-glyceraldehyde (GA; 20 mM), [Ca2+]i increased slowly, reaching a peak approximately 15 min after addition of the stimulus, while KCl (25 mM) and carbachol (2 mM) led to a rapid but transient increase in [Ca2+]i. Glucose increased [Ca2+]i from 104 +/- 6 (mean +/- SEM) to 248 +/- 31 mM (n = 13), and GA caused a rise in [Ca2+]i from 96 +/- 6 to 280 +/- 39 nM (n = 4). KCl and carbachol caused a rise from 107 +/- 6 to 184 +/- 5 nM and from 98 +/- 5 to 157 +/- 5 nM, respectively (n = 5 each). When insulin release was measured simultaneously with changes in [Ca2+]i and compared to unstimulated cells, the following results were obtained. During the first 5 min of stimulation, high glucose caused a 90 +/- 12% increase in insulin release and a 72 +/- 11% rise in [Ca2+]i (n = 5). GA evoked a 122 +/- 30% increase in insulin secretion, with a 82 +/- 17% rise in [Ca2+]i (n = 3). Both KCl and carbachol caused a 58 +/- 9% increase in insulin release, with 7 +/- 4% and 50 +/- 2% rises in [Ca2+]i, respectively (n = 4 each). Insulin release was also measured in a perifusion system. It was shown that glucose (30 mM), GA (20 mM), and alpha-ketoisocaproate (30 mM) caused a biphasic release of insulin, while KCl (25 mM) and carbachol (2 mM) caused a monophasic release. The results show that [Ca2+]i increases during the stimulation of insulin secretion when measured simultaneously on the same beta-cells. However, while these changes coincide, a simple direct quantitative relationship between insulin release and the rise in [Ca2+]i could not be demonstrated.\r"

Since abnormalities in several of these functions are observed in diabetic subjects, we investigated the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on the activity of the enzyme that converts norepinephrine to epinephrine [phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT)] in the brainstem and hypothalamus of the rat. Enzyme activity was measured in the supernatant of sonicated brain tissues of saline-treated control, diabetic, and insulin-treated diabetic rats. One month after streptozotocin treatment, increases in plasma glucose and food intake occurred; these were restored to control levels by insulin treatment. PNMT activity was approximately 2-fold higher in the brainstem of diabetic rats than in controls (P less than 0.0001), and administration of insulin partially prevented the effects of diabetes on PNMT activity (P less than 0.01 compared to diabetics and P less than 0.05 compared to controls). Brainstem enzyme activity measured in all animals (n = 53) exhibited a significant correlation with plasma glucose concentrations (r = 0.51; P less than 0.001). Diabetes had no apparent effect on PNMT activity in the hypothalamus. These findings are the first to suggest that experimental diabetes alters PNMT activity in the medulla/pons.\r"

At 42 mM, glucose induced a biphasic insulin release which was specific, since 42 mM mannitol did not elicit insulin release. Arginine (10 mM) or acetylcholine (0.1-1 microM), which in themselves do not cause insulin release, generated a biphasic insulin release in the presence of a low nonstimulating glucose concentration (14 mM); the effect was synergistic. In contrast to the glucose tolerance test observed in vivo, the pancreas from the fat line chicken in response to glucose or glucose plus arginine released significantly less insulin during the first phase. The significance of this defect awaits further elucidation. On the other hand, acetylcholine, a more potent secretagogue, did not reveal any significant difference between fat and lean chickens.\r"

The typical light scatter pattern (4 X 10(5) cells/sample X 15 min) had three ridges in the forward angle light scatter (FALS) perpendicular light scatter (PLS) bivariate cell distribution. FALS signals could be correlated with the size of different cell types and PLS signals with their content of cytoplasmic secretory granules. Agranular cells dominated the low PLS ridge while moderately granulated PRL cells and heavily granulated GH cells dominated the medium and high PLS ridges, respectively. These light scatter patterns were reproducible both within and between different cell suspensions. Inclusion of dopamine in the pituitary gland dissociation medium, a treatment known to increase intracellular PRL contents of mammotrophs, increased the intensity of the PLS signals of a large population of cells, presumably PRL cells. Pituitary cells prepared from different aged male rats also showed changes in light scatter. Cell sorting on the basis of FALS-PLS signals established the relationship between cell type and light scatter pattern.\r"

Epithelial cells, isolated by collagenase digestion of whole glands, were placed into primary serum-free collagen gel cell culture for 10-12 days, during which SM-C was added alone or in combination with other growth-promoting factors. Previous work has shown that these cells require a superphysiological concentration of insulin (10 micrograms/ml) for optimum growth in serum-free medium (a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium) containing epidermal growth factor (EGF). When SM-C (1-250 ng/ml) alone was added to serum-free basal medium containing EGF, it stimulated growth (at concentrations greater than 25 ng/ml) to at least the same extent as insulin at 10 micrograms/ml. There was no additive stimulation of growth when optimal concentrations of insulin and SM-C were added together. The nonadditive stimulation at optimal concentrations of these hormones may indicate that the previous requirement for a superphysiological concentration of insulin for maximum growth was due to low affinity binding of insulin to the SM-C receptor. Rat insulin-like growth factor II (Collaborative Research) at 50-200 ng/ml did not stimulate growth in the presence or absence of insulin. SM-C could not stimulate growth alone. The presence of EGF or mammogenic hormones (progesterone and PRL) was required.\r"

  ".W": "A transnasal, transsphenoidal surgical approach was used to perform hypothalamic pituitary disconnections (HPD) in ovariectomized (OVX) ewes to examine the role of the hypothalamus in regulating the synthesis of anterior pituitary hormones. Ewes were killed at 1-3 days (n = 6), 1 week (n = 5), or 1 month (n = 5) after HPD. Pituitary glands were removed, and hemisected for analysis of hormone or messenger RNA (mRNA) content. Blot hybridization using specific complementary DNA probes was used to quantify the concentration of mRNA for LH beta-subunit, alpha-subunit, GH, and PRL. Concentrations of mRNA for LH beta- and alpha-subunits were lower (P less than 0.01) at 1-3 days after HPD than in OVX ewes. At 1 week and 1 month after HPD, concentrations of mRNA for LH beta- and alpha-subunits were near the lower limit of detection of this assay system. In contrast, for 30 days after HPD, pituitary concentrations of mRNA for GH and PRL were not different (P greater than 0.05) from those in OVX ewes. At 1 week and 1 month after HPD, pituitary content of LH, FSH, and GH was lower (P less than 0.01) than in OXV ewes. Pituitary PRL content in all HPD ewes was lower (P less than 0.05) than in OVX ewes. In a separate group of five ewes that were bled daily for 30 days after HPD, serum concentrations of LH and FSH fell dramatically during the first 3 days after HPD. In contrast, serum concentrations of GH and PRL remained similar to pre-HPD concentrations for 30 days after HPD. Thus, hypothalamic stimulation is essential for maintaining the concentration of mRNA for LH beta- and alpha-subunits within the anterior pituitary gland. Without continued hypothalamic support, pituitary and serum concentrations of LH and FSH rapidly decline. In contrast, concentrations of mRNA for GH and PRL are maintained in the absence of hypothalamic input.\r"

The increase in blood LH produced by IVT NE or iv LHRH was unaffected in these drug-treated animals. Selective depletion of hypothalamic epinephrine by the administration of LY134046 (8,9-dichloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-2-benzazepine hydrochloride) potentiated the effect of AII on LH secretion. Blockade of alpha 1-, alpha 2-, or beta-adrenergic receptors resulted in a transient increase in basal LH levels. The stimulation of LH secretion induced by IVT AII or NE was unaffected by alpha 1-receptor blockade with prazosin, but was abolished by alpha 2-receptor blockade with yohimbine. beta-Receptor blockade with propranolol potentiated both NE- and AII-induced LH release. AII receptor blockade with IVT saralasin prevented the LH rise due to AII without modifying that due to NE. Taken together, these data suggest that IVT AII stimulates LH release in ovariectomized rats treated with estradiol and progesterone by releasing endogenous NE, which, in turn, acts on facilitatory alpha 2-receptors to affect LH secretion, presumably by increasing the secretion of LHRH. Exogenous NE also acts at this receptor. beta-Receptors provide inhibitory tone to this facilitatory system, and blockade of this receptor subtype results in potentiated LH responses to both AII and NE.\r"

After fixation, these cells can be identified and the distribution of their PRL determined by immunocytochemistry with anti-PRL antibodies. We have found that approximately 50% of the cells that contain intracellular PRL also have PRL or PRL-like immunoreactive material on the outer cell surface. Cell-surface PRL can be detected on unfixed anterior pituitary cells using anti-PRL antibodies and either fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cell surface labeling by anti-PRL antibodies was restricted to PRL-containing cells; 85-97% of the labeled cells contained detectable intracellular PRL, while fewer than 2% contained detectable GH, ACTH, LH, or TSH. Subpopulations of live anterior pituitary cells could also be labeled on the cell surface by antibodies against GH, ACTH, LH, or TSH. This suggests that the presence of hormone at the cell surface may be a characteristic and identifying feature of different anterior pituitary cell types.\r"

  ".W": "Using a specific antiserum against rat cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 (P-450scc), we examined the expression of this key steroidogenic enzyme during follicular development in PMSG-treated immature rats. The accumulation of the enzyme was monitored in ovary homogenates by quantitative immunodot blot assay, while expression of P-450scc in various cell types was visualized concomitantly by immunofluorescent staining of ovarian cryosections. Before PMSG treatment, no labeling of P-450scc could be observed in follicular granulosa cells. In contrast, steroidogenic cytochrome was markedly expressed in interstitial cells, part of theca interna cells, and hypertrophied theca of atretic follicles. As a result of PMSG treatment, the interstitial thecal cells promptly enriched their P-450scc content within 24 h, whereas the granulosa cells acquired the enzyme at a later time, between 30 and 48 h after hormone administration. After ovulation, many corpora lutea filled most of the ovarian volume, and the ovarian content of P-450scc was 47 times higher than that in control ovaries of untreated rats. In granulosa cell population of a single preovulatory follicle, a downward gradient of P-450scc expression was observed, starting high in the cells abutting the basal lamina and decreasing toward the cells lining the antrum. Cumulus cells failed to express P-450scc. Referring to the basal lamina, theca interna cells exhibited a reverse gradient of P-450scc expression, starting high in peripheral cells close to the theca externa layer and decreasing in cells located near the follicular basement membrane. Immunofluorescent labeling revealed a major difference between P-450scc expression in thecal cells compared to that in granulosa cells. While expression of P-450scc in granulosa cells was restricted exclusively to cells within preovulatory follicles, P-450scc labeling was observed throughout the ovary in thecal and interstitial cells associated with follicles at any phase of follicular maturation. Therefore, it may be proposed that the thecal and interstitial cells represent an all ovarian network which expresses its steroidogenic capacity at early stages of follicular maturation and thereby is able to supply androgens necessary for the follicular development.\r"

We have cloned a stable rat islet cell line expressing the glucagon gene at high levels, thereby allowing us to study the posttranslational processing of proglucagon in this cell line. In contrast to the processing of proglucagon in the pancreas, in which glucagon is liberated, in the cell line we found the intestinal pattern of peptides consisting of glicentin, at least two forms of GLP-I [GLP-I-(1-37) and GLP-I-(7-37)], GLP-II, IP-II, and an amidated form of IP-II. No individually processed glucagon peptide was detected. GLP-I-(1-37), GLP-I-(7-37), GLP-II, IP-II, and IP-II amide coeluted with their respective synthetic peptide standards on gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The existence of a single glucagon gene in the rat genome and indistinguishable glucagon mRNAs in pancreas and intestine indicates that the neoplastic transformation that occurred in these islet cells is associated with a phenotypic switch in the differential posttranslational processing of proglucagon to a pattern that mimics that found in the intestinal cells. These observations further support the hypothesis of a common progenitor for the intestinal (L) and islet (A) cells.\r"

Mestranol at 10(-6) M preferentially stimulated angiotensinogen production 5-fold, whereas cell growth rate was slightly increased. Comparable results were obtained for thymidine uptake in the course of the cell cycle, with a maximum increase for 10(-5) M mestranol, and an increase of angiotensinogen production for 10(-6) M mestranol. At 10(-6) M, tamoxifen acted as a pure antagonist by strongly inhibiting the stimulatory effect of mestranol and reducing angiotensinogen production to below the control level within 60 h. Tamoxifen did not affect the growth rate of HepG2 cells, either when administered alone or together with an equimolar concentration of mestranol.\r"

  ".U": "87053613\r", 
  ".W": "The question considered in this study concerns to what extent the ovaries of the immature hypophysectomized diethylestilbestrol-treated rat are populated by atretic follicles. Histological studies of ovaries on postoperative days 4-7 reveal the presence of numerous follicles showing signs of ill health. The granulosa cells constituting these follicles are heterogeneous and exist in three distinct zones. The cells in zone 1 are affixed to the basal lamina and form a tightly packed sheet of cuboidal epithelium one to two cells thick. The cells constituting zone 2 are located just medial to zone 1 and appear as a mass of loosely aggregated cells which show intense necrosis. Zone 3 is composed of the prospective cumulus-oocyte complex which appears completely normal. Results of histochemical studies show heterogeneity in the granulosa cells with respect to the presence and location of markers specific for atresia. In atretic follicles, the granulosa cells populating zones 1 and 2 contain lipid droplets and esterase activity, but are negative for the lysosomal enzyme acid phosphatase. The exact reverse is true for zone 3, where the cumulus express intense acid phosphatase activity but are negative for lipid and esterase activities. The granulosa cells in healthy follicles are totally negative for these histochemical markers. As a healthy preantral follicle grows, there is a dramatic increase in the mitotic index of the granulosa cells; however, in all atretic follicles, granulosa cell division is decreased by more than 90%. Further experiments using monoclonal antibodies as probes confirm the presence of atretic follicles and demonstrate that the structure-function changes in zones 1 and 2 are associated with striking changes in the antigenic properties of the granulosa cells. Morphometric studies indicate there are a total of 235 +/- 29 preantral follicles/ovary in the hypophysectomized diethylstilbestrol-treated rat. On postoperative day 4, 37 +/- 1.2% of the preantral follicles are atretic; this number increases linearly with time posthypophysectomy, reaching nearly 50% on postoperative day 7. Examination of follicles at different stages of development reveals that atresia is rare in the very early stages, e.g. follicles less than 200 microns in diameter; however, in the population of larger preantral follicles (those 200-400 microns in diameter), atresia is common, with nearly 80% being atretic on postoperative day 7. Collectively, these findings provide convincing evidence of widespread atresia in the ovaries of the hypophysectomized diethylstilbestrol-treated rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The MBH-POA (six per chamber) were perifused in vitro for 6 h. After 1 h of preincubation, basal LHRH, dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (E) release were estimated in perifusates collected during the second and third hours. During the fourth hour, chambers were perifused for 30 min with medium alone or medium containing NAL; tissue viability was confirmed during the sixth hour by adding 60 mM KCl to the medium. Tissue samples were weighed at the end of the perifusion and homogenized in 0.1 N HCl for subsequent analyses of LHRH contents. The basal release rate and cumulative hourly LHRH output from the MBH-POA of intact rats was about 3 times that from castrated rats (P less than 0.05). The NAL pulse stimulated LHRH release from the MBH-POA of intact and castrated rats (P less than 0.05); the amount released by the MBH-POA of intact rats was significantly higher than that from castrated rats (P less than 0.05). These differential LHRH release responses reflected the differences in the MBH-POA LHRH concentrations that normally occur between intact and castrated rats and also estimated at the end of the perifusion. In contrast to the LHRH response, the basal release rate and hourly output as well as NAL-induced DA release from the MBH-POA of intact and castrated rats were similar. On the other hand, as in the case of LHRH, basal NE release and hourly output from the MBH-POA of castrated rats were significantly reduced compared to those from the MBH-POA of intact rats (P less than 0.05). In addition, NAL promptly stimulated NE release, and the amount released was higher from the MBH-POA of intact rats (P less than 0.05). The basal amount of E released from the MBH-POA of intact and castrated rats was near or below the level of sensitivity of the assay. However, NAL increased E release from the MBH-POA of both groups of rats, and E output was apparently 2-fold higher from the MBH-POA of intact than castrated rats. Prior perfusion with morphine failed to block NAL-evoked stimulation of LHRH release from the MBH-POA of intact rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Using N- and C-terminal-directed antisera against rat/human (r/h) CRF, significant levels of CRF-LI were found in the adrenal medulla and hypothalamus, but not in the adrenal cortex. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that CRF-immunoreactive cells were located in the adrenal medulla, many of them concentrated in the vicinity of blood vessels and at the border between adrenal medulla and cortex. However, the cortex was devoid of any CRF-positive cells. On reverse phase HPLC, CRF-LI in the adrenal medulla coeluted with synthetic r/hCRF. In a bioassay system, using dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells, purified adrenal CRF caused a dose-dependent increase in ACTH secretion parallel to the r/hCRF standard, indicating that dog adrenal medulla contains authentic r/hCRF. Evidence of CRF-LI secretion from the adrenal was supported by its presence in adrenal venous, but not in peripheral arterial, plasma. Adrenal venous plasma CRF-LI coeluted with r/hCRF on reverse phase HPLC after affinity chromatographic purification. The CRF-LI secretory rate in conscious trained dogs was 68 +/- 19 pg/min (concentration, 27 +/- 5 pg/ml). In response to 20% hemorrhage, the CRF-LI secretion rate rose 3-fold within 15 min and was associated with increased catecholamine secretion. The existence of a biologically active CRF-like substance in the dog adrenal medulla and its secretion in conjunction with catecholamines after a hemorrhage suggest a physiological role for this peptide other than pituitary or central nervous system regulation.\r"

As other growth factor action has been associated with oncogene induction, we examined whether IGF-I activated cellular oncogenes in L6 rat muscle cells, known target cells of IGF-I stimulatory action. Quiescent cells were incubated in serum-free defined medium with IGF-I (Amgen recombinant analog, Thr59) from 5 min to 4 h. 32P-Labeled DNA was first prepared from IGF-I-treated cell poly(A) RNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. This labeled probe was hybridized against a blot containing 12 different immobilized oncogene DNAs. The v-fos DNA showed a positive hybridization signal, indicating the presence of c-fos mRNA sequences. Northern analysis with [32P]v-fos DNA revealed a major c-fos mRNA species (2.2 kilobases) induced by treatment of cells with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) or fetal calf serum (15%) for 45 min. We, therefore, measured c-fos induction by cytoplasmic RNA blot hybridization. IGF-I (6.25 ng/ml) stimulated c-fos mRNA 4-fold. Maximum stimulation (18-fold) was seen with 100 ng/ml IGF-I. Peak c-fos induction occurred after 30-min exposure to IGF-I and remained elevated for up to 2 h. Treatment of cells with a high dose of insulin (100 nM) also resulted in a modest (27%) increase in relative levels of c-fos mRNA. The results show that c-fos mRNA is induced by IGF-I in L6 cells. This novel observation suggests that IGF-I action at least in part may be mediated by c-fos, a cellular oncogene thought to play a critical role in cell differentiation and proliferation.\r"

To characterize its physiochemical properties, we obtained highly purified uterine renin by two affinity chromatographic steps, pepstatin and antirenin. Uterine renin has a pH optimum of 6, an apparent mol wt of 38K, and a Km of 1.7 microM for homologous substrate. These properties are identical to those of renal renin and are not influenced by the pregnant state. In the basal state, an inactive form of the uterine enzyme constitute 55 +/- 10% of the total uterine renin. During pregnancy, active renin increased 40-fold as inactive renin fell to 4 +/- 3% of the total renin concentration. The renal renin concentration fell as plasma renin increased during pregnancy. These data suggest that the increased uterine renin concentrations during pregnancy are probably due to increased local production and conversion of renin precursor to the active enzyme. This stimulation of the uterine renin level appears to be independent of renal renin.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether endogenous GH contributes to impairments of glucose metabolism in diabetes mellitus, we examined the metabolic consequences of GH deficiency in streptozotocin (SZ)-diabetic rats. Diabetic rats were treated with a highly specific antirat GH serum (ArGH) to neutralize the activity of circulating GH, and glucose metabolism was measured in adipose tissue in vitro in the absence or presence of insulin. Short term (6-h) GH deficiency led to a 10% decrease in hyperglycemia (P = 0.002) in SZ-diabetic rats. Basal glucose oxidation and insulin responses in adipose tissue were unchanged by acute ArGH treatment. Since hyperglycemia was improved when adipose tissue metabolism was unaltered, GH-dependent changes occurring in other tissues, such as liver or muscle, most likely contribute to derangements of glucose metabolism in diabetes, even when GH is not elevated. Prolonged GH deficiency was produced by infusing ArGH into SZ-diabetic rats for 5 days. In these animals, the relative fat content (percentage of wet weight) of adipose tissue was significantly increased. In addition, the conversion of [14C]glucose to lipid and CO2 in adipose tissue was significantly increased with chronic GH deficiency in SZ-diabetic rats, but the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose metabolism in the tissue was unaffected. These results indicate that endogenous GH suppresses basal glucose utilization in adipose tissue of diabetic animals; this is reversed by prolonged (5-day), but not acute (6-h), ArGH treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that the role of endogenous GH in the regulation of glucose metabolism in diabetic animals involves several mechanisms and multiple tissues.\r"

In conscious rats bearing indwelling cannulae, the changes in hormone concentrations after insulin injection were dependent on the changes in blood glucose levels with respect to both time course and magnitude. ACTH, corticosterone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels were found to be maximal at 60 min after 2.5 IU kg-1 insulin injected ip, whereas earlier (20 min) but smaller increases were obtained in response to 0.5 IU kg-1 insulin injected iv. In rats 6-7 days after lesions of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH), the rise of ACTH during insulin hypoglycemia was markedly inhibited and corticosterone levels were significantly reduced. Simultaneously, the hypoglycemia-induced increase in plasma epinephrine was unchanged and that in plasma norepinephrine was significantly enhanced in rats with the MBH destroyed. The beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol did not inhibit ACTH and corticosterone responses to hypoglycemia in either sham-operated or MBH-lesioned animals. We conclude that the main factors triggering ACTH release during insulin-induced hypoglycemia are of central rather than peripheral origin. The high concentrations of circulating catecholamines occurring during insulin hypoglycemia are not responsible for pituitary-adrenocortical activation by direct, beta-adrenoreceptor mediated action at the pituitary level.\r"

Perifusion of the islets prelabeled with 45Ca++ demonstrated that 100 nM monensin had only a slight inhibitory effect on the first phase insulin response to 16.7 mM glucose and no effect on 45Ca++ efflux. This agent inhibited the second phase insulin release and depressed 45Ca++ efflux. When monensin was added at the start of the second phase release, the release was inhibited. When exposed to the agent before the stimulation by glucose, the first phase insulin release was observed, albeit significantly decreased, and the start of the insulin release and 45Ca++ efflux was delayed. The agent, added 30 min after the change to high glucose, immediately inhibited the insulin release. Thus, the first phase insulin release is mediated mainly through a mechanism which is not related to protons generated from glucose metabolism. Protons may be a crucial coupling factor in the second phase insulin release.\r"

  ".W": "The conversion of androgens to active metabolites by neural tissue is believed to be an essential component in the cellular mechanism of androgen-induced neuroendocrine responses. In this study, we measured the in vitro aromatization and 5 alpha-reduction of androgens in incubations of microdissected brain regions from four intact and five castrated (6 weeks) adult male rhesus monkeys. Individual nuclei were microdissected from 600-microns frozen brain sections and homogenized in a potassium phosphate buffer. Aromatase activity was measured by a radiometric assay that uses the incorporation of tritium from [1 beta-3H]androstenedione into 3H2O as an index of estrogen formation. We estimated 5 alpha-reductase activity by isolating 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone on two different chromatography systems and measuring the amount of this product formed from [1 alpha,2 alpha-3H]testosterone. We acidified a portion of each homogenate and determined LHRH content by RIA. Between brain nuclei, aromatase activity varied 1500-fold, whereas 5 alpha-reductase activity varied only 3-fold. Both enzyme activities were highest in amygdaloid, medial preoptic, and medial diencephalic nuclei and lowest in the caudate nucleus. Aromatase activities in the supraoptic nucleus, periventricular area, medial preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus, and lateral hypothalamus were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower in castrated males. Castration did not significantly affect 5 alpha-reductase activity, except for an increase in the basolateral amygdala. The highest concentrations of LHRH were in the infundibular nucleus-median eminence and were 30 times greater than amounts measured in preoptic and medial hypothalamic nuclei. The LHRH contents of the infundibular nucleus-median eminence, ventral medial nucleus, and lateral hypothalamus were significantly lower in castrated males (P less than 0.05). In addition, we observed a significant correlation between aromatase activity and LHRH content in the basal hypothalamus of intact males (r = 0.947; P less than 0.05; n = 8), but not in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus (r = 0.068; P greater than 0.05; n = 10). No correlation was observed between 5 alpha-reductase activity and LHRH content in either area. These data indicate that castration selectively affects androgen metabolism and LHRH content in discrete regions of the brain of male monkeys and suggest that aromatase and 5 alpha-reductase are regulated differentially in the primate brain.\r"

L-glutamate (GLU), L-aspartate (ASP), quisqualate (QUIS), and N-methyl-D,L-aspartate reversibly depressed multiple (epileptiform) population spikes elicited by PEN (1.7 mM). Intracellularly recorded, PEN-evoked paroxysmal depolarization shifts (PDS) were partially blocked by 1 mM GLU and largely eliminated by 2 mM GLU or ASP. In the presence of PEN, perfusion with both GLU and ASP induced a transient 4 to 6-mV depolarization, usually followed by spontaneous return of membrane potential to control levels. During the amino acid (AA)-induced block of epileptiform activity, there was no significant change in resting membrane potential, input resistance, or the ability to fire action potentials in response to depolarization, indicating that the decreased responsiveness is not a consequence of nonspecific pyramidal cell overdepolarization. The observed depression of epileptiform activity by continued exposure to GLU and its analogues may reflect desensitization or another regulatory mechanism to limit overexcitation.\r"

Sera from treated monkeys caused exencephaly, anophthalmia, microcephaly, and incomplete ventral curvature when used as culture media, whereas sera drawn from the same monkeys before treatment supported normal embryonic development. To identify the cause of serum teratogenicity, isolated constituents of teratogenic sera were added to nonteratogenic sera for testing by embryo culture. Serum extracts containing free phenytoin and its free metabolites were not teratogenic. Teratogenicity was found associated with serum proteins. Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and an antibody that recognized phenytoin and its metabolites, we were able to demonstrate that phenytoin was bound to a protein of 80,000 daltons. Addition of this same antibody to teratogenic sera from dosed monkeys improved the development of cultured embryos and provided additional support for this complex as the proximal teratogen. Use of the antibody to follow the uptake and distribution of phenytoin in cultured embryos suggested that only the phenytoin-protein complex (and not phenytoin itself) was able to pass through the yolk sac and reach the tissues of the embryo proper. These results suggested that a drug-protein complex may serve to transport drugs from their site of activation in the maternal liver to the developing embryo.\r"

Tissue sensitivity to insulin (euglycemic clamp technique) and liver microsomal enzyme activity (oral antipyrine test) were measured in six subjects with epilepsy plus type 1 diabetes mellitus. They had received anticonvulsant drugs for greater than 8 years. Three groups--type 1 diabetics, persons with epilepsy, and healthy subjects--matched for sex, and weight, served as controls. Glucose disposal rate (M) was faster in subjects on anticonvulsant therapy as compared with the corresponding control group (p less than 0.01) and in nondiabetics as compared with diabetics (p less than 0.001). Antipyrine metabolism was rapid among patients on anticonvulsants and high normal in diabetics. Liver microsomal enzyme activity and glucose metabolism were related among diabetic (r = 0.593) and nondiabetic (r = 0.649) groups, respectively. Anticonvulsants with liver microsomal enzyme-inducing properties appear to enhance insulin sensitivity. These findings may serve to understand the long-term effect of anticonvulsants on glucose metabolism in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy and tolerability of vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl GABA, GVG), given as add-on therapy to 23 adult outpatients with severe drug-resistant epilepsy (17 with partial seizures), were studied using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. The study consisted of two 7-week periods during which vigabatrin and placebo were administered in random sequence. Dosage was 1.0 g twice daily for patients weighing less than or equal to 65 kg and 1.5 g twice daily for patients weighing greater than 65 kg. Three patients were dropped from the study, two for reasons unrelated to treatment and one because of the appearance of vertigo, headache, dysarthria, and ataxia, which subsided rapidly when vigabatrin was stopped (3 g daily). Sixteen of the 20 patients available for analysis showed a decrease in the total number of seizures as compared with the placebo period. Of these, 12 showed a greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency and 4 of the 12 showed a greater than 75% reduction. Both the total number of seizures and the number of partial seizures were significantly reduced by vigabatrin (p less than 0.01). Only in the patient who dropped out were severe adverse effects seen. The most frequently reported unwanted effect was mild drowsiness, which developed in seven patients on vigabatrin and in one on placebo. Positive effects, however, were also seen with six patients who reported an improved sense of well-being while receiving vigabatrin as compared with only 1 during the placebo period. No consistent changes in electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), and visual-, auditory-, and somatosensory-evoked potentials were seen during the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nine patients (23.1%) ovulated from the same side for six consecutive cycles, whereas no patient alternated side of ovulation in the same period of time. Stimulation with clomiphene citrate and/or human menopausal gonadotropin that results in single ovulation did not affect this pattern. The data were analyzed statistically with the use of a Markov Chain Model and the chi-square goodness-of-fit; the occurrence of persistent same-side ovulation was significant to P less than or equal to 0.001.\r"

With surgical findings as the standard, US was as accurate (sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%) as HSG (sensitivity 98%, specificity 92%) in demonstrating uterine abnormalities and provided a more complete assessment of the abnormality. US was as accurate (sensitivity 100%, specificity 91%) as HSG (sensitivity 96%, specificity 94%) in demonstrating the presence of tubal patency but less accurate in establishing which tubes were patent. Thus real-time US with fluid instillation provides an accurate alternative to HSG in screening for uterine abnormalities and tubal patency.\r"

This must be recognized as not necessarily related to age but also associated with adnexal inflammatory and operative processes. Although ovulation occurs uninterruptedly, the follicle-stimulating hormone in the early follicular phase is elevated and the luteinizing hormone is normal. Characteristically, there is no estradiol response to human menopausal gonadotropin therapy or a rapid response with a premature luteinizing hormone surge. These problems sometimes may be overcome with pulsatile intravenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy, 5 or 10 micrograms/90 or 120 minutes. The major therapeutic problem is in the identification of a luteinizing hormone surge in these patients. Of eight women who were treated, two failed to respond with follicular maturation, three either had no oocytes aspirated from apparently postmature follicles or had postmature oocytes; and one had treatment cancelled due to ovulation. The four latter patients may have failed because of unrecognized ovulation. In the remaining two patients, one oocyte was fertilized and transferred, and one pregnancy occurred.\r"

The authors further examined the effects of porcine relaxin and PGE2 on the motility of human spermatozoa. A dose-response study revealed that PGE2 at a concentration of 25 micrograms/ml is most effective in improving the motility of washed human sperm. Relaxin (100 ng/ml), PGE2 (25 micrograms/ml), or the two combined have no effect on the motility of spermatozoa in fresh, normal semen, suggesting that the constituents of fresh semen are optimal for motility. Relaxin and PGE2 individually improve the motility of washed spermatozoa. However, relaxin, but not PGE2, improves the motility of sperm in semen incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 hours (aged). In contrast to the individual substances, a combination of relaxin + PGE2 has no effect on the motility of washed spermatozoa or aged spermatozoa, suggesting that these two substances antagonize each other's actions on sperm motility. The presence of both relaxin and PGE2 in seminal plasma with normal motility spermatozoa suggests that other factors in seminal plasma regulate the effects of these substances on sperm motility.\r"

  ".W": "There is a definite increase in the number of women bearing children in the 30- and 40-year-old age groups. The total number of women who are 35 to 40 years of age in the United States is projected to increase 42% and the percent births to this age group is projected to increase 37%. This is apparently because of a trend to postpone childbearing and first birth due to women's career priorities, advanced education, control over fertility, financial concerns, late and second marriages, and infertility. Associated with this is an increase in visits to the infertility specialist for older women who have an intrinsic decrease in fecundity with advancing age. Although, on the average, a woman will not experience menopause until about 50 years of age, her effective childbearing period may stop almost a decade earlier. A woman in her late 30s and, especially, early 40s is at some disadvantage in terms of conception delay, ability to carry a chromosomally normal fetus until term, and risk of trisomic conception. Certain endocrinologic parameters have been identified for the woman entering the transition to menopause. Biologic aging of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is intertwined with changes in the endocrine milieu of the perimenopause and preperimenopause. Despite a clear association of decreased fecundity in older women due to multiple biologic and social influences, so long as the individual has regular cycles and essentially normal endocrine parameters, she should be a candidate for an expedited infertility workup and ovulation induction, if not more aggressive treatment. Her obstetric profile is much improved, except for an increase in congenital anomalies and chromosomal defects. Chorionic villus biopsy study or amniocentesis is advised in all cases, regardless of therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We sought to determine whether the clinical setting in which pancreatitis occurs affects the incidence and distribution of increased values of renal clearance of amylase relative to creatinine, CAm/CCr, and whether the increased values reflect a tubular disorder that impairs renal reclamation of certain low molecular weight proteins. We measured the renal clearance of three low molecular weight proteins (amylase, beta 2-microglobulin, and lysozyme) and urinary excretion of three lysosomal enzymes that originate from the renal tubule in three groups of patients (alcoholic pancreatitis, pancreatitis without alcoholism, and alcoholism without pancreatitis). When compared to normal controls, the mean CAm/CCr was significantly elevated in alcoholic pancreatitis (p less than 0.05) but not in equally severe pancreatitis without alcoholism nor in alcoholism without pancreatitis. The clearance ratio of beta 2-microglobulin was significantly increased in each of the three patient groups; mean clearance ratio of lysozyme was not significantly increased in any of the patient groups. Excretion of each of the three lysosomal enzymes was significantly increased in each of the patient groups. We conclude that the etiology of pancreatitis affects the distribution of values for CAm/CCr, impaired tubular reclamation of amylase is the mechanism of the increase in CAm/CCr, and a factor or factors associated with both pancreatitis and with alcoholism per se appear to disorder the renal tubule and to impair tubular reclamation of some but not all low molecular weight proteins-a novel finding of considerable potential significance.\r"

At the same time, milk IgG enters vacuoles in the distal small intestine unaided by a receptor and is degraded. To help define the distinction between the handling of IgG by the proximal and distal neonatal small intestine, we simultaneously localized IgG (by peroxidase-labeled antibodies) and acid phosphatase (by a lead phosphate technique) at the ultrastructural level. In the proximal small intestinal epithelial cells, IgG-containing vesicles were separate from acid phosphatase-containing structures, whereas in the distal intestinal epithelial cells, IgG was present together with acid phosphatase in large supranuclear vacuoles. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that IgG avoids degradation in the proximal intestinal cells because vesicles in which it is transported do not fuse with lysosomes, whereas IgG in the distal small intestine is degraded in lysosomal enzyme-containing organelles.\r"

  ".W": "The intrahepatic distribution of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and surface antigen (HBsAg) was studied in 32 patients with chronic type B hepatitis, and the results were correlated with the status of hepatitis B e antigen/antibody (HBeAg/anti-HBe) and with the histologic activity of the patients. In HBeAg-positive patients with minor hepatitis activity, HBcAg was distributed mainly in the nuclei, whereas HBsAg was diffusely located on the plasma membrane as well as focally in the cytoplasm. In HBeAg-positive patients with chronic active liver disease, although the distribution pattern of HBsAg in liver remained unchanged, the expression of nuclear HBcAg decreased significantly with concomitant increase in cytoplasmic/membranous HBcAg expression. In HBsAg carriers who were anti-HBe positive, HBcAg was undetectable anywhere, whereas HBsAg could be seen only in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that membranous expression of HBsAg relates closely to active viral replication but is probably not responsible for the observed histologic activities. In contrast, cytoplasmic/membranous expression of HBcAg correlates with high degree of liver inflammatory activity. It is therefore suggested that hepatocytes with cytoplasmic/membranous HBcAg expression might be the target cells for immune hepatocytolysis.\r"

The theory that rectal mucosal prolapse causes SRUS and localized CCP is strengthened by the observation of like pathology in other clinical situations and various animal models in which mucosal prolapse occurs. However, rectal prolapse is not clinically demonstrable in all patients. Therefore, the definitive diagnosis of SRUS and localized CCP must depend upon the recognition of specific histopathologic features in rectal biopsy specimens from ulcer margins or otherwise abnormal mucosa. Conservative medical management is satisfactory for most patients, and surgical intervention should be reserved for highly selected patients.\r"

A total of 384 patients with endoscopically proven acute duodenal ulcer disease were enrolled. Patients received either famotidine or a placebo. The patients receiving famotidine were treated with one of three dose regimens, 40 mg h.s., 40 mg b.i.d., or 20 mg b.i.d. Patients were reassessed by endoscopy at 2, 4, and 8 wk if ulcer healing had not occurred sooner. A diary was kept to record the duration and intensity of the day and night pain and the amount of Gelusil antacid (Parke-Davis, Morris Plains, N.J.) ingested. Three hundred sixty-three patients met the evaluation criteria. The results revealed a 4-wk healing rate of 70%, 75%, 67%, and 31% for the famotidine 40 mg h.s., 40 mg b.i.d., 20 mg b.i.d., and placebo groups, respectively. The 8-wk healing rates for the same respective groups were 83%, 82%, 82%, 45%. Ulcer pain and antacid consumption occurred less often in the famotidine groups. The clinical and laboratory safety profile of the famotidine groups was similar to that of the placebo group. Famotidine appears to be an effective and safe once-a-day therapy for the treatment of acute duodenal ulcer disease. The recommended dosage is 40 mg h.s.\r"

Stellate-shaped cells with similar, but not identical characteristics, form a three-dimensional network deep within the villar lamina propria. Electron microscopic studies indicate that these cells contain a putative contractile apparatus, are attached to each other and to apparently organized elements of the extracellular matrix by typical adhesive devices, and form gap junctions with each other. Comparative in situ immunoperoxidase localization studies document the presence in these cells of four contraction-associated proteins (smooth muscle isotropomyosin, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase, both nonmuscle and smooth muscle isomyosin, and actin) in amounts generally greater than those found in connective tissue fibroblasts, but less than in smooth muscle cells. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a smooth muscle-like, contractile function for these cells and indicate that this cellular network may provide a supportive tonus for the epithelium, as well as provide the force needed for active movement of the villus, expulsion of crypt secretion products, and propulsion of absorption products in the lamina propria, the microvasculature, and lacteals of the intestinal villus.\r"

We identified the protein by postembedding staining with protein A-colloidal gold and by preembedding staining with peroxidase. The protein was found not only in the brush border membrane, but also in the endoplasmic reticulum including nuclear envelope, Golgi complex, smooth apical vesicles, and to a variable extent in the multivesicular bodies. Our findings are consistent with current concepts of biosynthesis of plasma membrane proteins, with synthesis, translocation, and initial glycosylation occurring at the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum and further processing occurring in the Golgi complex. The findings suggest the possibility that some intracellular degradation of sucrase-isomaltase occurs. Finally, our results appear to indicate that at least the final step of intracellular movement, transfer to the brush border membrane, is mediated by smooth apical membrane vesicles.\r"

The two groups were similar with respect to age, sex, and the extent of colitis. In addition all patients received a standard intravenous regimen consisting of methyl prednisolone 16 mg six hourly and parenteral nutrition together with a twice daily hydrocortisone 100 mg enema. Treatment was continued for five days when the patients were formally assessed. Fourteen of 19 patients (74%) receiving metronidazole and 14/20 (70%) receiving placebo were substantially improved, or in remission at the end of five days. Five patients treated with metronidazole and six with placebo had no improvement and all proceeded to urgent colectomy with no operative mortality. There were three late deaths, one in the metronidazole and two in the placebo group. These results do not support the routine use of intravenous metronidazole in the treatment of severe ulcerative colitis.\r"

  ".W": "Addiction and abuse of antipyretic analgesics has been recognized early after the turn of this century. The incidence markedly increased and the syndrome spread over many countries in the first half of the 20th century. The syndrome and its pathology, consisting of renal papillary necrosis and tubulo-interstitial nephritis, was first described in the medical literature in the early 1950's in Switzerland by Spuhler and Zollinger, who rightly suspected chronic analgesic (Saridon) intoxication as being the cause in their cases. Clinically the disease is characterized by slowly progressive renal failure with renal colics from passage of necrotic papillae. Death from uremia is common unless dialyzed. The disease has been particularly prevalent in certain areas of Australia, Belgium, Western Germany, in Switzerland and some other countries. The nephrotoxic agents are mixtures of salicylates (aspirin) with phenacetin or acetaminophen. The principal nephrotoxic compound is probably aspirin--the aminophenol derivatives increasing its nephrotoxicity. However, all these components alone may cause--exceptionally--the syndrome. Rarely some newer, nonsteroid analgesics (NSAID's) can also be nephrotoxic. Phenacetin has--in particular in compound mixtures--mood-altering (euphoric) properties, giving rise to craving, addiction and chronic abuse. Addiction has been greatly facilitated by the over-the-counter availability of these cheap analgesic mixtures. Mass addiction--and abuse--may occur in all kinds of communities, in factories or families because of the euphoric effect, taking away fatigue and weariness and increasing productivity. There is a relation between the per capita consumption of antipyretic analgesics and analgesic nephropathy in several countries and in certain districts. The pattern of sales and mass consumption (and the incidence of nephropathy) is substantially promoted by the local presence of production facilities, usually accompanied by vigorous sales and advertising policies. Individual addiction usually occurs in psychoneurotic females often with social and marital problems and mental instability, often with long histories of headaches, backpains, and other, often psychogenic disorders. Analgesic nephropathy is often complicated by anemia, peptic ulcer, premature aging and atherosclerosis and in 8-10% by uro-epithelial carcinoma (the so called analgesic syndrome). The diagnosis depends largely on the history of chronic abuse of analgesics, which is often doggedly denied, hampering the diagnosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The VLM has been implicated as being involved in a number of different physiological functions, including central chemoreception, integration of afferent inputs from certain sense organs to the respiratory and cardiovascular controllers, the source of excitatory input to preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the spinal cord, and location of synaptic relay between the higher brain defense areas and spinal cord sympathetic elements. In recent years there have been a number of important findings concerning both the anatomical substrate and neurophysiological characteristics of VLM neurons involved in regulation of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. New anatomical findings show that neuronal networks located in the VLM send projections to and receive projections from brain stem nuclei that have traditionally been associated with respiratory and cardiovascular regulation. Nevertheless, there are still many important questions concerning the role of the VLM in control of these vital systems that have yet to be answered. For instance, are the same VLM neurons involved in control of both systems? Is the VLM the only site for central respiratory chemoreception? This review will endeavor to examine new findings and to reexamine some older findings concerning the VLM.\r"

  ".W": "Lennon et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 55: 489-495, 1983) have recently reported a large loss of muscle total carnitine (TC) after 40 min of moderate exercise. These authors have also suggested that elevations in plasma esterified carnitine (EC) were due to the release of these carnitine esters from muscle during exercise. After 10 male subjects underwent 90 min of cycle egometry we found no alteration in muscle TC from preexercise values. Plasma EC progressively increased above resting values during exercise and remained elevated above rest at 0.75 and 1.5 h into recovery. Elevations of plasma EC were largely due to a decrement in free carnitine (FC) in both conditions. Immediately postexercise the urinary fractional reabsorbsion of EC and FC were similar to that at rest. These results suggest that a net loss of TC from exercising muscle does not occur. As in other conditions marked by falling insulin concentrations, elevations in plasma EC could result from an exchange of carnitine with the hepatic carnitine pool.\r"

  ".W": "Fasting before exercise increases fat utilization and lowers the rate of muscle glycogen depletion. Since a 24-h fast also depletes liver glycogen, we were interested in blood glucose homeostasis during exercise after fasting. An experiment was conducted with human subjects to determine the effect of fasting on blood metabolite concentrations during exercise. Nine male subjects ran (70% maximum O2 consumption) two counterbalanced trials, once fed and once after a 23-h fast. Plasma glucose was elevated by exercise in the fasted trial but there was no difference between fed and fasted during exercise. Lactate was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in fasted than fed throughout the exercise bout. Fat mobilization and utilization appeared to be greater in the fasted trial as evidenced by higher plasma concentrations of free fatty acids, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate as well as lower respiratory exchange ratio in the fasted trial during the first 30 min of exercise. These results demonstrate that in humans blood glucose concentration is maintained at normal levels during exercise after fasting despite the depletion of liver glycogen. Homeostasis is probably maintained as a result of increased gluconeogenesis and decreased utilization of glucose in the muscle as a result of lowered pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Endotoxin increases pulmonary vascular permeability consistently in some species but fails to reliably cause injury in the dog. We wondered whether this phenomenon depended on the method of injury assessment, as others have relied on edema measurement; we quantified injury by monitoring the rate of extravascular protein accumulation. 113mIn-labeled protein and 99mTc-labeled erythrocytes were injected into anesthetized dogs and monitored by an externally placed lung probe. A protein leak index, the rate of extravascular protein accumulation, was derived from the rate of increase in lung protein counts corrected for changes in intravascular protein activity. After administration of Salmonella enteriditis endotoxin (4 micrograms/kg), the protein leak index was elevated 2.5-fold (41.1 +/- 4.6 X 10(-4) min-1) compared with control (16.0 +/- 2.8 X 10(-4) min-1). In contrast, wet-to-dry weight ratios failed to increase after endotoxin (4.6 +/- 0.8 vs. control values of 4.2 +/- 0.5 g/g dry bloodless lung). However, we observed that endotoxin increased lung dry weight (per unit body weight), which may have attenuated the change in wet-to-dry weight ratios. To determine whether low microvascular pressures following endotoxin attenuated edema formation, we increased pulmonary arterial wedge pressures in five dogs by saline infusion, which caused an increase in wet-to-dry weight ratios following endotoxin but no change in the five controls. We conclude that low dose endotoxin causes pulmonary vascular protein leak in the dog while edema formation is minimal or absent.\r"

When instilled into the air spaces, porcine pancreatic elastase (0.1-0.4 mg/ml) and bovine pancreatic trypsin (BPT) (0.5-2.0 mg/ml), but neither Clostridium histolyticum collagenase (5.0 mg/ml) nor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-inactivated BPT caused large increases in the AC of both tracer molecules. BPT-induced solute clearance was further characterized functionally and morphologically. The functional characteristics of solute AC under steady-state conditions did not indicate that transepithelial transport was diffusion-limited. Inhibition by millimolar concentrations of Zn2+ and by lung cooling, along with electron microscopic studies employing horseradish peroxidase as a macromolecule tracer, were consistent with epithelial solute transport by a vesicular mechanism (transcytosis). Solute transport from the interstitial compartment to the lung exterior was shown to occur via two pathways. By unknown mechanisms BPT caused small amounts of water to flow through an incompletely identified, extravascular pathway. In BPT-exposed lungs efflux of 125I-dextran 70 occurred almost exclusively through this pathway, whereas [14C]sucrose was transported to the lung exterior partly through this same pathway and partly through the vasculature. The large differences in the diffusion coefficients of the two tracers may have accounted for these observed patterns of solute efflux from the lung. The possible significance of our findings to the pathogenesis of experimental emphysema are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Although it is well accepted that skin blood flow (SkBF) in humans is controlled by thermoregulatory reflexes, the conclusion that the cutaneous circulation is also controlled by reflexes of nonthermoregulatory origin is not universally held. This review considers the extent to which the cutaneous circulation participates in baroreceptor-mediated reflexes and in the reflexes associated with exercise. Exercise is explored in some detail, because it elicits both thermoregulatory and nonthermoregulatory reflexes. The overall conclusion reached is that thermoregulatory control of SkBF is subject to modification by or competition from several other sources. The fundamental pattern for control of SkBF is described by the threshold and slope of the SkBF-internal temperature relationship. Reflex effects of skin temperature act to shift the threshold of this relationship such that lower levels of skin temperature are associated with higher threshold internal temperatures at which cutaneous vasodilation begins. Similarly, baroreceptor reflexes, reflexes associated with exercise, and effects of some cardiovascular disease also operate against this background. Although modification of the SkBF-internal temperature slope is occasionally seen, the most consistent effect of these nonthermoregulatory factors is to elevate the threshold internal temperature for cutaneous vasodilation. The consequence of this modification of thermoregulatory control of SkBF is that temperature regulation will often suffer when increases in SkBF are delayed or limited. Blood flow to other regions, possibly including active skeletal muscle, may also be compromised when thermoregulatory demands for SkBF are high.\r"

Bronchoconstriction was rapid in onset, reaching a maximum 2-5 min after a single inhalation of AMP. In 31 asthmatic subjects a positive correlation was established between airway responsiveness to histamine, as an index of non-specific responsiveness, and airway reactivity to adenosine (PCf20, r = 0.60; PCs40, r = 0.64; P less than 0.01). Following bronchial provocation with allergen in nine subjects, plasma levels of adenosine increased from a mean base line of 5.4 +/- 0.9 to 9.6 +/- 2.0 ng/ml at 15 min (P less than 0.01) in parallel with a fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s. With methacholine provocation bronchoconstriction reached maximum 2-5 min postchallenge being followed by, but not accompanied by, significant increases in plasma levels of adenosine. These data suggest that adenosine is a specific bronchoconstrictor that may contribute to airflow obstruction in asthma.\r"

This view was tested by an exercise protocol aiming at identical stimulation of the adrenal medulla in the two groups. Eight athletes (T) and eight controls (C) ran 7 min at 60% maximal O2 consumption (VO2max), 3 min at 100% VO2max, and 2 min at 110% VO2max. Plasma epinephrine both at rest and at identical relative work loads [110% VO2max: 8.73 +/- 1.51 (T) vs. 3.60 +/- 1.09 mmol X l-1 (C)] was higher [P less than 0.05) in T than in C. Norepinephrine, as well as heart rate, increased identically in the two groups, indicating identical sympathetic nervous activity. Lactate and glycerol were higher in T than in C after running. Glucose production peaked immediately after exercise and was higher in T than in C. Glucose disappearance increased less than glucose production and was identical in T and C. Accordingly plasma glucose increased, more in T than in C (P less than 0.01). In T glucose levels approached the renal threshold greater than 20 min postexercise. Glucose clearance increased less in T than in C during exercise and decreased postexercise to or below (T, P less than 0.05) basal levels, despite increased insulin levels. Long-term endurance training increases responsiveness of the adrenal medulla to exercise, indicating increased secretory capacity. During maximal exercise this may contribute to higher glucose production, lower clearance, more inaccurate glucoregulation, and higher lypolysis in T compared with C.\r"

We studied 11 yearling sheep in paired studies during progressive maximal treadmill exercise with and without meclofenamate (n = 5), ibuprofen (n = 6), or UK38485 (n = 2). We also studied five sheep during hypoxia and hypoxic exercise, and six sheep during prolonged steady-state treadmill exercise for 45-60 min with and without drug treatment. We measured the metabolites of thromboxane A2 (thromboxane B2, TxB2) and prostacyclin (6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha) in blood plasma and lung lymph in each protocol. We found that progressive exercise significantly reduced pulmonary vascular resistance but that cyclooxygenase or thromboxane synthesis blockade did not alter the change. Plasma TxB2 rose minimally but significantly during maximal exercise, but 6-keto-PGF1 alpha did not change. During continuous hypoxia, exercise reduced pulmonary vascular resistance nearly to base-line levels, but the degree of reduction was also unchanged by drug treatment. There were also no significant changes in lymph or plasma TxB2 or 6-keto-PGF1 alpha during 45-60 min of continuous moderate exercise. We conclude that neither TxB2 nor prostacyclin modulate pulmonary hemodynamics in the normal lung during maximal exercise, prolonged moderate exercise, or exercise-induced reductions in vascular resistance during hypoxia.\r"

RAR impulse activity was recorded from the cervical vagus nerves in anesthetized open-chest dogs whose lungs were ventilated at constant rate and tidal volume (VT), with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 3-4 cmH2O. After hyperinflation to produce maximal Cdyn, RAR's were silent or fired sparsely and irregularly. Reducing Cdyn in steps by briefly removing PEEP increased firing proportionately, and RAR's began to discharge vigorously in inflation. Activity was restored to control by hyperinflating the lungs. Activity also increased when we increased inflation rate, and hence the rate of change of airway pressure (dP/dt), by reducing inflation time, keeping VT and cycle length constant. RAR's were stimulated more when dP/dt was increased by reducing compliance than when dP/dt was increased by increasing inflation rate. We conclude that RAR's are sensitive to changes in Cdyn and speculate that excitatory input from RAR's may help to maintain VT as the lungs become stiffer.\r"

  ".W": "Between October 1981 and December 1983 21 premature infants of mean gestational age 27.5 weeks (range 26-29 weeks) underwent surgical closure of persistent ductus arteriosus. Mean birth weight was 1080 g. There was no operative mortality. One death in an infant with pseudomonas septicaemia occurred two days after surgery. Twenty infants had features of idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) and required assisted ventilation prior to operation. Six infants had associated bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and 11 had signs of congestive cardiac failure. All infants presented with clinical features suggesting the diagnosis of PDA and in 18 the left atrial/aortic ratio was increased (mean 1.9:1). In 18 infants a trial of Indomethacin therapy had failed. This experience supports the view that surgical closure of PDA in infants born before 30 weeks gestation can be accomplished safely. We believe that surgical treatment of PDA represents the optimal therapy in this high risk group of infants.\r"

  ".W": "Renal synthesis of the antiaggregatory and vasodilatory prostacyclin and its endogenous antagonist thromboxane A2 may be disturbed in patients with preeclampsia. We tested this hypothesis by measuring 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha; a hydration product of prostacyclin), 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha (generated from 6-keto-PGF1 alpha through beta-oxidation) and thromboxane B2 (a hydration product of thromboxane A2) in the urine of healthy pregnant and preeclamptic women. Urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha [19.8 +/- 10.5 pmol/mmol creatinine, (mean +/- SD)] and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha (19.2 +/- 7.5 pmol/mmol creatinine) increased during normal pregnancy, reaching a maximum (about 5-fold rise) during the last month of pregnancy. No significant changes occurred in the urinary excretion of thromboxane B2. In women with severe preeclampsia (n = 17), the excretion of both 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (37.7 +/- 29.5 pmol/mmol creatinine) and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha (54.5 +/- 56.2 pmol/mmol creatinine) was lower (P less than 0.001) than in the normotensive women during the last trimester of pregnancy (80.6 +/- 43.7 and 98.7 +/- 42.9 pmol/mmol creatinine, respectively). The neonates excreted 6-25 times more 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane B2 than did the nonpregnant women. In contrast to the adults, neonatal 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion was 2-3 times greater than that of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha suggesting reduced beta-oxidation in the newborns. Infants born to preeclamptic women had reduced output of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha on the first day of life. Thus, renal prostacyclin synthesis is diminished in women with severe preeclampsia and their infants.\r"

  ".U": "87057942\r", 
  ".W": "To determine if treatment with the GnRH agonistic analog nafarelin could reliably block ovulation while only partially disrupting ovarian estrogen production, three degrees of pituitary-ovarian inhibition were investigated. Thirty-two women with ovulatory menstrual cycles were given 125 micrograms (group (Gp) I), 250 micrograms (Gp II), or 1000 micrograms (Gp III) nafarelin daily by intranasal spray. Twenty-seven women completed 6 months of treatment. Basal serum FSH concentrations decreased (P less than 0.01) in all groups. Suppression of serum LH was dose dependent and significant (P less than 0.01) only in Gps II and III. Pituitary desensitization to nafarelin developed in all groups. Peak LH responses to nafarelin decreased by about 70% (Gps I and II) and 95% (Gp III). Basal serum estradiol levels after 1 month of treatment were approximately 70 pg/ml (Gp I) and 25 pg/ml (Gps II and III). Serum estradiol levels increased acutely in Gps I and II, but not in Gp III, in response to each dose of nafarelin. Thus, average daily estradiol levels in Gp II were higher than those in Gp III. Serum testosterone and androstenedione levels decreased slightly (P less than 0.05; Gp II) or by 50% (P less than 0.01; Gp III) during treatment. The effects of nafarelin on ovulatory function also were dose-dependent. In Gp I there were four ovulations (progesterone, greater than 4 ng/ml) and seven instances of luteinization (progesterone, 2-4 ng/ml) during 73 months of nafarelin administration. In contrast, there were no ovulations during 58 and 44 months in Gps II and III, respectively. After discontinuance of nafarelin, ovulatory menstrual function returned rapidly in all women. In summary, inhibition of pituitary-ovarian function by daily intranasal nafarelin administration is dose dependent. Gonadotroph sensitivity to 125 micrograms is variable, and there is inconsistent inhibition of ovulation. Daily doses of 250 or 1000 micrograms analog reliably inhibit ovulation, but are associated with either moderate (Gp II) or marked (Gp III) reduction of ovarian estradiol secretion. The effects of these reduced levels of circulating estradiol on bone are not known. Further investigation, with dosage adjusted according to individual patient sensitivity, may lead to the development of a clinically acceptable contraceptive which consistently inhibits ovulation while maintaining serum estradiol levels sufficient to prevent osteoporosis.\r"

Unlike IGF-II binding to the classical type II IGF receptor, [125I] IGF-II binding to IM-9 cells was potently inhibited not only by unlabeled IGF-II, but also by insulin (50% inhibition of binding at 2.5 and 1.5 nM, respectively). Affinity cross-linking of [125I] IGF-II to intact cells, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, demonstrated that the overwhelming majority of IGF-II binding was to a type I receptor (apparent mol wt, greater than 300,000 unreduced and 135,000 reduced), with minimal binding to a type II receptor (apparent mol wt, 220,000 unreduced and 240,000 reduced). After preincubation with five different antireceptor antibodies, inhibition of [125I] IGF-II binding was comparable to inhibition of [125I]insulin binding. These studies demonstrate that in IM-9 cells, the majority of IGF-II binding is to a type I receptor with high affinity for both insulin and IGF-II. Whether this is an atypical insulin receptor or a unique type I receptor remains to be established.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of insulin secretion in patients with insulinoma is known to be abnormal. For example, physiological and pharmacological stimuli often fail to stimulate insulin in such patients. Recently, insulin has been found to inhibit its own secretion in normal subjects. To determine if insulin has this effect in patients with insulinoma, we infused insulin at rates of 1 and 10 mU/kg X min in such a patient and in eight normal subjects. Euglycemia was maintained by the euglycemic glucose clamp technique, and endogenous insulin secretion was estimated by measuring plasma C-peptide levels. In the normal subjects, plasma C-peptide declined from 1.60 +/- 0.22 (+/- SEM) to 1.16 +/- 0.17 and 0.82 +/- 0.11 ng/ml during the low and high dose insulin infusions, respectively, indicating 27% (P less than 0.01) and 48% (P less than 0.001) decreases in endogenous insulin secretion at moderately elevated and extremely elevated insulin levels, respectively. In the insulinoma patient, plasma C-peptide was 2.6 ng/ml basally, did not change during the low dose insulin infusion, and rose to 3.4 ng/ml during the high dose insulin infusion. We conclude that the feedback regulation of insulin secretion by insulin that occurs in normal subjects is absent in insulinoma patients. This finding could have pathophysiological and possibly diagnostic significance.\r"

Meals were consumed at 0800 h (20% of daily calories) and noon (40% of daily calories), and measurements were made hourly from 0800-1600 h. Day-long plasma glucose, insulin, and FFA concentrations were higher than normal (by two-way analysis of variance) in patients with NIDDM, whether obese or nonobese. In addition, day-long plasma glucagon concentrations were also higher than normal (by two-way analysis of variance) in both nonobese and obese patients with NIDDM. Furthermore, direct relationships were found between the total plasma glucagon response from 0800-1600 h and total plasma glucose (r = 0.57; P less than 0.001) and FFA (r = 0.30; P less than 0.06) responses. In contrast, plasma GH levels were not increased in patients with NIDDM. These data demonstrate that ambient plasma concentrations of both glucose and FFA are higher in patients with NIDDM, despite the fact that coexisting plasma insulin levels are equal to or higher than normal. The higher day-long plasma glucagon levels in patients with NIDDM may contribute to their higher plasma glucose and FFA concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of peptide histidine-methionine (PHM)-like peptides has been determined in plasma and tumor specimens from patients with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-secreting tumors and the watery diarrhea syndrome. All patients had strikingly elevated plasma concentrations of PHM immunoreactivity (median, 1800; range, 500-6800 pmol/liter; n = 12), which were higher than those of VIP (median, 235; range, 50-580 pmol/liter). In patients with other endocrine and nonendocrine pancreatic tumors, plasma PHM concentrations were not significantly different from normal (median, 20; range, 5-60 pmol/liter; n = 28). Plasma samples from patients with diarrhea due to other illnesses also had PHM concentrations that were not significantly different from normal (median, 40; range, 10-80 pmol/liter; n = 23). The gel chromatographic profiles of plasma and tumor extracts from patients with VIP-secreting tumors revealed the presence of at least two molecular forms that reacted with an antiserum directed to the N-terminus of PHM (SY1). The later peak (Kav, 0.50-0.53) corresponded in position to synthetic PHM and also reacted with the PHM-specific antiserum (SY2). The earlier peak (Kav, 0.30-0.37), not reactive with antiserum SY2, corresponded to a large molecular form of PHM-like immunoreactivity previously identified as the predominant form in normal human stomach and plasma, though not in the rest of the intestinal tract. The neuroendocrine nature of the tumors was confirmed by the demonstration of immunostaining with a battery of antisera to neuroendocrine markers. Immunocytochemistry revealed the presence of both VIP and PHM in tumor cells. The presence of high circulating concentrations of PHM-like immunoreactivity in patients with VIP-secreting tumors, as measured with a PHM N-terminus-directed antiserum, SY1, suggests that use of this type of antiserum may provide valuable information in the diagnosis of such tumors. The contribution of the PHM-like peptides to the features of this syndrome is not known.\r"

  ".U": "87057972\r", 
  ".W": "The importance of androgenic activity in mediating the effects of obesity and body fat topography on splanchnic insulin metabolism and peripheral insulin sensitivity was studied in 19 nonhirsute premenopausal women with a wide range of ideal body weight [percent ideal body weight (% IBW), 78-202%] and body fat distribution pattern [waist to hip girth ratio (WHR), 0.67-0.91]. Turnover kinetics of peripheral plasma C-peptide and insulin were measured, and estimates of pancreatic insulin production (PIP) and the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) were calculated. The peripheral insulin sensitivity index (M/I) was determined during an euglycemic insulin clamp study. Androgenic activity was assessed by estimating the plasma level of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and percentage of free testosterone (% FT). After iv glucose stimulation, PIP ranged from 40-254 mU/min X m2 and correlated highly with % IBW (r = 0.78; P less than 0.01). Insulin HEF ranged from 5-69% of the pancreatic production and was inversely proportional to WHR (r = -0.60; P less than 0.01). Increasing WHR also correlated with the diminution in M/I (r = -0.47; P less than 0.05), which, in turn, correlated with the decline in the HEF of insulin (r = 0.60; P less than 0.01). Since PIP, HEF, and M/I correlated with SHBG and % FT, and since the degree of androgenic activity correlated with % IBW and WHR, partial regression analysis was performed. After adjusting for the effects of SHBG and % FT, the relationship between % IBW and PIP remained unaltered, whereas the correlation between WHR and HEF or M/I and their relationship to each other were either markedly reduced or became insignificant. Thus, in premenopausal women, the increase in pancreatic insulin production with increasing weight is independent of the degree of androgenic activity. On the other hand, the decline in hepatic insulin extraction and diminution in peripheral insulin sensitivity with upper body fat localization are in part mediated by increased androgenic activity. This association may account for the pronounced hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance characteristic of this form of obesity.\r"

However, it has not been demonstrated in man that insulin can enter the CSF from peripheral blood. To test whether increases in plasma insulin result in elevated CSF immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels, we infused insulin iv in varying amounts approximating postprandial levels in eight normal subjects for 4.5 h. Euglycemia was maintained [88 +/- 3 (+/- SEM) mg/dl] by means of a variable glucose infusion. Samples were obtained every 30 min for measurements of insulin in peripheral plasma and insulin in lumbar CSF. Plasma IRI increased from a mean basal level of 12 +/- 1.2 microU/ml to a mean (during the 180- to 270-minute period) of 268 +/- 35 microU/ml. CSF IRI increased in all subjects during the infusion from a mean basal level of 0.9 +/- 0.1 microU/ml to a mean (during the 180- to 270-min period) of 2.8 +/- 0.4 microU/ml (P less than 0.006). By contrast, CSF IRI in two subjects who received an infusion of 0.9% saline did not increase. In summary, CSF insulin concentrations increased during peripheral infusions of insulin. This is the first demonstration in man that plasma insulin gains access to CSF and indicates a mechanism whereby peripheral insulin could provide a feedback signal to the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "It is generally held that idiopathic hyperaldosteronism and glucocorticoid-suppressible hyperaldosteronism (GSH) are distinct entities, distinguishable by thorough investigation. We report a patient who presented in 1974 at age 15 yr with blood pressure of 240/120 mm Hg, serum K of 3.1 mM, low renin, and high normal aldosterone excretion, with findings diagnostic of GSH. After dexamethasone treatment (2 mg/day for 4 weeks), urinary aldosterone was undetectable (less than 1 microgram/24 h), associated with correction of hypertension and hypokalaemia. While untreated, plasma aldosterone increased in response to ACTH infusion at a dose that did not influence plasma cortisol. Plasma aldosterone at 0800 h while recumbent was higher than in subsequent samples taken while ambulant, consistent with ACTH dependence of aldosterone secretion. Blood pressure, renin, and potassium remained normal for 4 yr during treatment with dexamethasone (0.5-0.75 mg/day), but hypertension then slowly returned. After 7 yr, the original studies were repeated. Urinary aldosterone excretion was again in the high normal range after 3 weeks of no treatment, but both plasma renin and aldosterone consistently increased in response to upright posture. After dexamethasone treatment (2 mg/day) for 4 weeks, urinary aldosterone was not suppressed (excretion rate, 10.8, 9.2, and 5.7 micrograms/day; urinary Na, greater than 100 mmol/day; urinary cortisol, less than 1 microgram/day). At this time, dexamethasone did not alleviate hypertension or increase renin. Control of blood pressure has been readily achieved, 8-12 yr after diagnosis, with a low dose of beta-adrenergic antagonist and amiloride. Aldosterone remains incompletely suppressible during sodium loading, so that the findings now resemble those of idiopathic hyperaldosteronism. This sequence indicates that glucocorticoids may not permanently control hypertension in GSH. The transient dominance of ACTH in control of aldosterone secretion indicates that the relationship between GSH and idiopathic hyperaldosteronism merits further evaluation in long term studies.\r"

In addition, testicular 17 alpha-hydroxylase, 17,20-desmolase, and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme activities of the delta 4 pathway were measured. These intratesticular steroids and enzyme activities from four GnRH-A-treated patients were compared to those in five men (controls) who were orchiectomized as the primary treatment for their disseminated prostatic cancer and in three other men who were treated for 3-12 months with GnRH-A daily but received, in addition to the daily GnRH-A, 1000 IUhCG, im, every other day for 3 days immediately before their salvage orchiectomy, which was performed when their disease progressed. In the control group, the delta 5-steroids, particularly dehydroepiandrosterone and pregnenolone, represented the majority of the intratesticular steroids. Compared to control values, all intratesticular steroids except delta 4-P (for which there was no difference) were significantly lowered by treatment with GnRH-A. Intratesticular T was reduced by 98% from 328 +/- 139 (+/- SEM) ng/g testis in the control group to 8 +/- 3 in the GnRH-A-treated group (P less than 0.01). The additional treatment with hCG for 3 days in the GnRH-A-treated group reversed the inhibition of all steroids to either control or above control levels, with intratesticular T rising to 1144 +/- 273 ng/g testis. A similar trend was found for all three enzymatic activities, i.e., GnRH-A alone inhibited each of the enzymatic activities, whereas the addition of hCG reversed this inhibition by GnRH-A. These data indicate that the chronic administration of GnRH-A to elderly men results in inhibition in both the delta 4 and delta 5 pathways, with a subsequent decrease in the intratesticular T concentration. The ability of exogenous hCG to reverse both the reduction in delta 4 and delta 5 intratesticular steroid content and the intratesticular enzyme activities induced by GnRH-A treatment supports the concept that GnRH-A does not have a direct inhibitory effect on testicular T biosynthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of aging on serum LH and testosterone (T) pulse frequency and gonadotroph sensitivity to androgen and estrogen feedback was studied in young (less than 55 yr old) and elderly (greater than 65 yr) Trappist monks. LH pulse frequency (sampling interval, 20 min) was significantly lower [0.25 +/- 0.03 (+/- SEM) vs. 0.38 +/- 0.02 pulses/h; P less than 0.01] in elderly (n = 21) than in young monks (n = 27); the pulse amplitudes were similar. Similarly, T pulse frequency was lower in the elderly than in the young monks (0.13 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.02 pulses/h; P less than 0.01). In elderly men, the hypothalamo-pituitary complex was more sensitive to 5 alpha-androstan-17 beta-ol-3-one feedback, as determined by the decrease in serum LH and T levels. Moreover, during 5 alpha-androstan-17 beta-ol-3-one (125 mg/day, percutaneously, for 10 days) administration, the LH response to LHRH (100 micrograms, iv) was significantly higher in the elderly men compared to the pretreatment response. During estradiol (1.5 mg/day, percutaneously for 10 days) administration, the LH response to LHRH was decreased in the elderly men, but unchanged in the young men, suggesting greater responsiveness to estradiol in the elderly men. We conclude that in aged men, decreased testicular androgen secretion is not exclusively the consequence of a primary testicular alteration, but that important changes occur in hypothalamo-pituitary function, specifically decreased LH pulse frequency and increased LH responsiveness to sex hormone feedback.\r"

We, therefore, studied insulin action in normal women during the menstrual cycle in the follicular, luteal, and menstrual phases. Glucose tolerance was similar at all three times. Specific insulin receptor binding to monocytes did not change during the menstrual cycle. Euglycemic insulin clamp studies at four different insulin infusion rates (15, 40, 120, and 240 mU/M2 X min) showed no differences in insulin sensitivity or responsiveness throughout the menstrual cycle, and hepatic glucose output did not change. These studies suggest that if insulin action is impaired during menstruation in diabetic women it is because of factors that are not detected in normal women.\r"

The protocol included 3 study periods: control, after administration of insulin, and after administration of typhoid vaccine (an interferon-alpha inducer). Plasma cortisol and mononuclear leukocyte ACTH immunofluorescence were measured before (0900 h) and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h after treatment on each of the 3 study days. In vitro studies with human leukocytes from normal subjects incubated with ACTH, insulin, or typhoid vaccine were also performed. Patients with normal pituitary ACTH production had an increase in the number of ACTH immunofluorescence-positive cells 1 h after insulin administration [25 +/- 5% (+/- SEM) to 44 +/- 6% P less than 0.05], and no change after typhoid administration. ACTH-deficient patients had no change after insulin administration and a significant rise 6 h after typhoid vaccine treatment (24 +/- 12% to 50 +/- 6%; P less than 0.05). The number of ACTH immunofluorescence-positive cells did not increase when mononuclear leukocytes were incubated in vitro with ACTH or insulin (with or without glucose deprivation). However, typhoid antigen enhanced this response from 8% to 55%. These data suggest that the number of human mononuclear leukocytes containing immunoreactive ACTH is increased by at least 2 stimuli: 1) a central factor(s), such as CRH, accounting for the in vivo rise 1 h after insulin administration in patients with an intact hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and 2) an interferon inducer (e.g. typhoid antigen), accounting for the typhoid antigen-induced rise in the number of ACTH-positive cells in vivo in ACTH-deficient patients and in vitro.\r"

In the nondiabetic subjects, glucose turnover rates determined with [6(14)C]glucose during insulin infusion were lower (P less than 0.02) than those determined with [2(3)H]glucose and higher (P less than 0.01) than those determined with [3(3)H]glucose. In IDDM, glucose turnover rates measured with [6(14)C]glucose during insulin infusion were lower (P less than 0.05) than those determined with [2(3)H]glucose, but were not different from those determined with [3(3)H]glucose. All three isotopes indicated the presence of insulin resistance. However, using [3(3)H]glucose led to the erroneous conclusion that glucose utilization was not significantly decreased at high insulin concentrations in the diabetic patients. [6(14)C] and [3(3)H]glucose but not [2(3)H]glucose indicated impairment in insulin-induced suppression of glucose production. These results indicate that tritiated isotopes do not necessarily equally reflect the pattern of glucose metabolism in diabetic and nondiabetic man.\r"

Size selectivity may be compromised in the lungs of patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To assess this question, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from normal volunteers (n = 11), cardiac edema patients (n = 3), and ARDS patients (n = 8) was compared. Mean total protein in ARDS BALF was greater than 12 times the levels in normals or cardiac edema patients. BALF/plasma total protein ratios and measurements of epithelial lining fluid protein also separated the patients groups. The large proteins IgM and alpha 2-macroglobulin were found in ARDS BALF at greater than 90 times the concentrations of normal or cardiac edema fluid. The relationship of distribution coefficient vs. log molecular weight for seven proteins (54,000-900,000 mol wt) hyperbolically increased in normals but was flat in ARDS patients. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a paucity of high molecular weight proteins in normal and cardiac edema BALF, but demonstrated the full spectrum of plasma proteins in ARDS BALF. We conclude that normal size selectivity is preserved in cardiac edema but is destroyed by the alveolar-capillary injury of ARDS.\r"

In support of this, we found that oxidant-induced vascular injury of isolated perfused rabbit lungs caused elevated circulating Fn levels. Western blot analysis indicated that Fn released from the injured blood vessels was intact, dimeric, and possessed electrophoretic mobility identical with Fn produced by fibroblasts. Unlike Fn isolated from rabbit plasma, Fn derived from lung perfusate or produced by fibroblasts reacted with antibodies raised to a synthetic peptide containing sequences from the extra type III Fn domain that is transcribed in fibroblasts but not hepatocytes. Vascular injury by protease was also associated with intravascular release of Fn, but with cleavage. Oxidant-induced vascular injury causes release of tissue-derived Fn, which can be distinguished from plasma Fn by its size and content of antigenic determinants of the extra type III domain.\r"

When compared with the nonobese women, obese women had significantly greater prehepatic production and portal vein levels of insulin both basally and following glucose stimulation. This increase correlated with the degree of adiposity but not with waist-to-hip girth ratio (WHR). WHR, however, correlated inversely with the hepatic extraction fraction and directly with the posthepatic delivery of insulin. The latter correlated with the degree of peripheral insulinemia. The decline in hepatic insulin extraction with increasing WHR also correlated with the accompanying diminution in peripheral insulin sensitivity. Increasing adiposity is thus associated with insulin hypersecretion. The pronounced hyperinsulinemia of upper body fat localization, however, is due to an additional defect in hepatic insulin extraction. This defect is closely allied with the decline in peripheral insulin sensitivity.\r"

We have purified her insulin(s) from the specimen of her pancreas, which was biopsied during an operation of cholelithiasis. Insulin was also immunologically purified from the serum of her portal vein. The reverse-phase HPLC analysis revealed that the ratios of normal to abnormal insulin in the pancreas, portal vein, and peripheral vein were 5:4, 4:5, and 1:7, respectively. Radioreceptor assay for insulin using guinea pig kidney membrane revealed that the binding activities of the normal component insulin, the abnormal component insulin and her pancreatic insulin containing both components were 100, 5, and 50% of standard human insulin, respectively. The biological activities of the normal component, the abnormal component and her pancreatic insulin to stimulate glucose oxidation in rat adipocytes were found to be 100, 8, and 60% of standard human insulin, respectively.

Defects in smooth muscle cell basement membrane were found throughout the media in cystic medial degeneration and in medionecrosis, whereas in atherosclerosis such unlabelled areas were found only above advanced atherosclerotic plaques. In aortitis other defects in the smooth muscle cell basement membrane were found in areas of inflammatory infiltrates. In all of these conditions similar defects in fibronectin expression were also found. No defects in the expression of interstitial collagens type I and III were seen in the dissecting aortas. Moreover, cystic medial degeneration, medionecrosis, and atherosclerosis were characterised by intense staining of these interstitial matrix components. In the pathogenesis of the aortic dissection local changes in the basement membranes of the medial layer may be important.\r"

Linear unilateral basal cell nevus with comedones is not a variant of the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and the tumors follow a benign course. The aggressive, destructive behavior of numerous pigmented basal cell carcinomas that involve the eyelid and medial canthus of the eye and the head and neck area represents important evidence that our patient's condition was not an example of linear unilateral basal cell nevus with comedones.\r"

  ".W": "This review is designed to inform the clinician of current concepts regarding the pathogenesis of chemically induced skin cancer. Chemicals induce cutaneous cancers in a wide variety of experimental animals and in humans. The most common benign experimental tumors are papillomas and keratoacanthomas, whereas common malignancies are squamous cell carcinomas and melanomas. Carcinoma development is a multistage process that involves at least three mechanistically distinct steps. Initiation is the earliest change in an epidermal cell exposed to carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylating agents, or nitrosamines. This stage appears to result from carcinogen-induced deoxyribonucleic acid damage leading to a mutation-like genetic change. Only a limited number of epidermal genes may be changed to yield the initiated cell, and one has been identified as the Harvey ras gene, a gene involved in epidermal proliferation. Initiated epidermal cells are not malignant but are insensitive to the normal signals for terminal differentiation in the epidermis. The second stage, tumor promotion, results from repeated exposure of initiated skin to one of a variety of noncarcinogenic promoting agents such as phorbol esters, benzoyl peroxide, anthralin, or certain halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. Some promoters require specific cellular receptors and produce transient changes in the growth or differentiation of the epidermis. Collectively these agents produce a tissue environment that is conducive to the selective clonal outgrowth of the initiated cell population, resulting in a clinically apparent premalignant tumor. During the third stage of carcinogenesis, premalignant cells are converted to malignancy. This step may occur spontaneously, but the frequency is greatly enhanced by exposure to mutagens, including several initiating agents. Thus malignant conversion is likely due to additional mutations in a benign tumor cell. The Harvey ras gene may also be a potential target in the conversion step. Several agents, such as corticosteroids and retinoids, have been identified as anticarcinogens for skin. They appear to be primarily antipromoting agents and could important clinical applications. Melanomas can be induced in several species by repeated exposure to initiators or by exposure to an initiator and a tumor promoter. the experimental pathogenesis of this tumor is unclear. It is proposed that intermediates in the synthesis of melanin pigment could act as endogenous carcinogens or promoters in melanoma development. Increased awareness of the mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis in skin will enhance cancer prevention in this tissue. Furthermore, astute\r"

  ".W": "We report ten cases of a characteristic vesiculobullous eruption in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Clinically, six lesions were thought to represent insect bites. All ten patients had bone marrow examinations that confirmed the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In six of ten patients serum protein and immunoelectrophoresis were performed. Six patients had immunoglobulin disturbances: one polyclonal IgG and IgM gammopathy, two monoclonal IgM gammopathies, two decreased levels of IgA, and one hypogammaglobulinemia. Direct and indirect immunofluorescence procedures were performed on two patients and results were negative. Immunoperoxidase procedures for IgG stained nonspecifically along torn/separated areas of the basement membrane in five patients. No immunohistochemistry was performed on the remaining three patients. The etiology and pathogenesis of these lesions are unknown. We favor the concept that they represent an unusual reaction to an arthropod bite, secondary to the underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. A second, and less likely theory, is that these lesions represent an unusual clinical presentation of bullous pemphigoid in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\r"

We studied the effect of two hemostatics: 30% aluminum chloride and ferric subsulfate (Monsel's solution) on the rate of wound healing in Yucatan miniature hairless pigs. Wound healing was examined in occluded and nonoccluded full-thickness 3-mm punch biopsy wounds. Wounds were treated either with 30% aluminum chloride solution or ferric subsulfate solution or were allowed to clot with minimal pressure from a gauze pad. The course of wound healing was followed utilizing evaporimetry readings from the wound sites in addition to periodic histologic examination in an attempt to correlate the evaporimetry readings with corresponding histology. Delay in reepithelialization was noted histologically both in wounds treated with aluminum chloride and in those treated with ferric subsulfate compared to controls. Presumably this delay was the result of tissue necrosis caused by these hemostatic agents, resulting in slightly larger and less cosmetically acceptable scars. Plots of evaporimetry data revealed a biphasic pattern of water loss during healing, with an initial rapid decline in water loss followed by a much slower decline. Histologic reepithelialization seemed to correlate best with the point on the evaporimery curve where the slope changed from the phase of rapid water loss to a slower rate.\r"

Only two patients had scabies 1 month following a single treatment with this product, giving a cure rate of 91%. One of these two patients was considered to have a reinfestation.

The unusually high percentage of treatment failures (35%) following lindane therapy may have been related to extensive use of this agent for head lice and scabies in this village during the preceding 5 years. The higher cure rate at 1 month seen with permethrin cream was significant (p less than 0.025). Permethrin 5% dermal cream offers a new, cosmetically elegant alternative to lindane therapy and was effective in a community in which lindane demonstrated an unacceptable level of treatment failures.\r"

Of the patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, 40% had positive antinuclear antibodies at titers of 1:80 dilutions or greater. There were no differences between patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and positive antinuclear antibodies compared with those with negative antinuclear antibodies in relation to clinical or hemodynamic status. A 6% incidence rate of antinuclear antibodies was found in patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension, similar to that in the normal population. The clinical, hemodynamic, serologic and histologic similarity between patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and those with unexplained pulmonary hypertension associated with collagen vascular disorders suggests that primary pulmonary hypertension in some patients may represent a collagen vascular disease confined to the lungs. The frequency of positive antinuclear antibody tests would place primary pulmonary hypertension between rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma in the spectrum of collagen vascular diseases. Further studies are necessary, however, before one might expect that immunosuppressive therapy would be beneficial to these patients.\r"

Overall, 34.6% of all patients referred were eventually accepted for transplantation but, of these, 71.9% underwent the procedure. Of those patients accepted but not undergoing the procedure, the vast majority (58.8%) died awaiting a donor heart; another 30.8% later refused the procedure. Very few patients (2.1%) who were accepted for transplantation were deselected as possible candidates because of improved health status. The number of patients awaiting transplantation at all centers was found to be small at the time of study. The results of the analyses revealed major differences among centers in evaluation procedures, proportion of patients accepted and number of patients receiving a transplant. For example, one center performed transplantation on only 50.0% of all patients it accepted, while another did so in more than 81.0% of such patients. It is concluded that both patient selection and donor supply will remain significant determinants of the outcome of patients referred for cardiac transplantation.\r"

Assessment of coronary hemodynamic variables and vasodilator reserve may provide more reliable information regarding the significance of coronary stenosis. To provide a clinically safe and reliable method of measuring coronary blood flow velocity and coronary flow reserve, a 3F steerable Doppler catheter capable of subselective placement in the coronary circulation was developed and validated in an animal model. Coronary blood flow velocity measured with the catheter correlated with simultaneous measurements by a previously validated external cuff type Doppler probe (r = 0.97), coronary sinus flow collections (r = 0.78) and femoral artery flow collections (r = 0.96). The extravascular Doppler cuff measurements of rest flow velocity and vasodilator reserve were not significantly different with or without the catheter in the artery, indicating that the Doppler catheter caused no obstruction to blood flow. The Doppler catheter has recorded stable and reproducible signals without complications in 28 patients, including 62 separate arterial cannulations. Thus: 1) the 3F Doppler coronary catheter is nonobstructing, steerable and safe; 2) there is an excellent correlation of blood flow velocity with volume collections; and 3) the catheter provides a reliable method of determining coronary blood flow velocity and coronary vasodilator reserve.\r"

  ".U": "87058512\r", 
  ".W": "Pulsed Doppler echocardiography was used to determine prospectively the prevalence of mitral, aortic, tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation in 80 consecutive patients with mitral valve prolapse and 85 normal subjects with similar age and sex distribution. Mitral valve prolapse was defined by posterior systolic displacement of the mitral valve on M-mode echocardiography of 3 mm or more (40 patients), the presence of one or more mid- or late systolic clicks (61 patients), or both. Mitral regurgitation, detected by pulsed Doppler techniques in 53 patients with prolapse, was holosystolic in 24, early to mid-systolic in 6, late systolic in 15 and both holosystolic and late systolic behind different portions of the valve in 8. Definitive M-mode findings were present in only 27 of the 53 patients, and only 21 had mitral regurgitation audible on physical examination. Tricuspid regurgitation was evident by pulsed Doppler echocardiography in 15 patients (holosystolic in 9, early to mid-systolic in 1, late systolic in 4 and both holosystolic and late systolic in 1); 12 of these 15 patients, including all with an isolated late systolic pattern, had an echocardiographic pattern of tricuspid prolapse, but none had audible tricuspid regurgitation. A Doppler pattern compatible with aortic regurgitation was recorded in seven patients, all without echocardiographic aortic valve prolapse and only two with audible aortic insufficiency. A Doppler shift in the right ventricular outflow tract in diastole, suggestive of pulmonary regurgitation, was recorded in 16 of the 78 patients with an adequate Doppler examination: only 1 of the 16 had audible pulmonary insufficiency. Of the 85 normal subjects without audible regurgitation, pulsed Doppler examination detected mitral regurgitation in 3 subjects (holosystolic in 1 and early to mid-systolic in 2), aortic regurgitation in none, tricuspid regurgitation in 9 (holosystolic alone in 8 and both holosystolic and late systolic in 1) and right ventricular outflow tract turbulence compatible with pulmonary insufficiency in 15. The prevalence of valvular regurgitation, detected by pulsed Doppler echocardiography, is high in patients with mitral valve prolapse. Regurgitation may involve any of the four cardiac valves and is clinically silent in the majority of patients. The prevalence rates of mitral and aortic regurgitation are significantly higher in patients with mitral prolapse than in normal subjects, suggesting that alterations in underlying valve structure in the prolapse syndrome may indeed be responsible for this regurgitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Because some prenatal tachyarrhythmias have been shown to respond to antiarrhythmic drugs, correctly diagnosing fetal arrhythmias has assumed new importance. With the aid of two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging, an M-mode cursor can be aligned to record atrial and ventricular wall motion--either independently or simultaneously. A consistent feature in the fetus is prominent atrial wall contractions that can be readily recorded on the M-mode tracing. By matching atrial and ventricular wall contractions with assumed P waves and QRS complexes, the fetal electrocardiogram can be reconstructed. In 57 fetuses studied, recurrent atrial and ventricular ectopic beats were the most common prenatal arrhythmias. However, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, atrial and ventricular bigeminy and atrial and ventricular bradyarrhythmias have been correctly identified and in some instances appropriately treated. Marked fetal bradycardia in the midtrimester of pregnancy is shown for the first time to be caused by transducer pressure on the maternal abdominal wall.\r"

  ".U": "87058533\r", 
  ".W": "Venous thrombi are intravascular deposits composed predominantly of fibrin and red blood cells with a variable platelet and leukocyte component. They frequently arise in large venous sinuses in the calf, in valve cusp pockets either in the deep veins of the calf or thigh or in venous segments that have been exposed to direct trauma. Venous thrombosis can be produced experimentally by a combination of stasis and systemic hypercoagulability or by stasis and endothelial damage. Thrombosis is augmented if the fibrinolytic mechanism is inhibited or defective. A number of clinical conditions and laboratory abnormalities are associated with and predispose to venous thrombosis and, in many of these, it is possible to identify one or more of the thrombogenic factors discussed. Venous thromboembolism (venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) is a serious and potentially fatal disorder that usually complicates the course of sick hospitalized patients, but occasionally affects ambulant and otherwise healthy individuals. Screening studies with iodine-125 fibrinogen leg scanning, impedance plethysmography and perfusion lung scanning have shown that the majority of venous thrombi and pulmonary emboli that occur in hospitalized patients are small and asymptomatic, and it is likely that most are clinically insignificant. In bedridden patients, most thrombi commence in the calf and are asymptomatic. When a calf vein thrombus extends into the proximal venous segment, the risk of clinically significant pulmonary embolism increases. Less is known about the incidence and clinical significance in a nonhospital population; although asymptomatic disease occurs, its frequency is unknown. In contrast to the patients with asymptomatic venous thrombosis, symptomatic patients with venous thrombosis usually have large occulsive thrombi localized in their proximal veins.\r"

  ".U": "87058534\r", 
  ".W": "The clinical diagnosis of venous thrombosis is inaccurate because the clinical findings are both insensitive and nonspecific. The sensitivity of clinical diagnosis is low because many potentially dangerous venous thrombi are clinically silent. The specificity of clinical diagnosis is low because the symptoms or signs of venous thrombosis all can be caused by nonthrombotic disorders. For these reasons, a practical approach for the diagnosis of venous thrombosis is important. A current approach to the diagnosis of clinically suspected venous thrombosis favors the use of impedance plethysmography over Doppler ultrasonography as the main test for this disorder. This is because impedance plethysmography is precise and objective, whereas the interpretation of Doppler ultrasonography is subjective and requires considerable skill and experience to form reliable diagnoses. The use of serial impedance plethysmography has been evaluated recently in a prospective study. The rationale of repeated impedance plethysmography evaluation is based on the premise that calf vein thrombi are only clinically important when they extend into the proximal veins, at which point detection with impedance plethysmography is possible. Therefore, by performing repeated examinations with impedance plethysmography in patients with clinically suspected venous thrombosis, it is possible to identify patients with extending calf vein thrombosis who can be treated appropriately. Impedance plethysmography is performed immediately on referral; if it is positive in the absence of clinical conditions that are known to produce falsely positive results, the diagnosis of venous thrombosis is established, and the patient is treated accordingly. If the result of the initial impedance plethysmography evaluation is negative, anticoagulant therapy is withheld, and impedance plethysmography is repeated the following day, again on day 5 to 7 and on day 10 to 14. If impedance plethysmography becomes positive during this time, a diagnosis of venous thrombosis is made and anticoagulant therapy is commenced. Positive impedance plethysmography in the presence of conditions known to produce a false positive result (for example, congestive cardiac failure) should be confirmed by venography. If noninvasive tests for the diagnosis of venous thrombosis are not available, a clinical suspicion of venous thrombosis should be objectively confirmed or excluded by performing ascending venography.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is highly nonspecific because none of the symptoms or signs of pulmonary embolism is unique and all may be caused by other cardiorespiratory disorders. Thus, objective testing is mandatory to either confirm or exclude a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Based on current available information, a diagnostic approach for the management of clinically suspected pulmonary embolism is proposed. After a history and physical examination, electrocardiogram and chest X-ray film, all patients should undergo perfusion lung scanning. The finding of a normal perfusion lung scan rules out clinically significant pulmonary embolism, and anticoagulant therapy is withheld. The management of patients with an abnormal perfusion lung scan is more complex. If this scan demonstrates one or more segmental (or greater) perfusion defects, ventilation lung scanning should be performed because the probability of pulmonary embolism is markedly increased if a mismatch is found, with a high probability scan (positive predictive value 86%) providing an end point for commencing anticoagulant therapy in the majority of patients. In an abnormal ventilation-perfusion study, the presence of a ventilation-perfusion match does not rule out the possibility of pulmonary embolism, and further objective testing is required in these patients with nonhigh probability scans. Similarly, in patients with small perfusion defects (one or more subsegmental defects) or indeterminate lung scan findings (in which the perfusion scan defects correspond to a defect on a chest X-ray film), the predictive values obtained from these ventilation-perfusion scan patterns are not sufficiently high or low to confirm or exclude the presence of pulmonary embolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87058537\r", 
  ".W": "Venous thromboembolism produces chronic sequelae in the legs and occasional immediate mortality due to pulmonary embolism. Because it occurs in certain high risk situations (for example, after surgery) its prevention is a practical proposition. This has been attempted using many different approaches. Administration of low dose heparin with or without dihydroergotamine to enhance venous return has been one of the most widely tested regimens. There is little doubt that this can prevent, in many patient groups, postoperative deep venous thrombosis and fatal pulmonary embolism, with a low incidence of adverse reactions. Some particularly high risk postoperative patient groups (for example, those undergoing hip surgery) warrant more aggressive measures to prevent thrombosis. Surveys have shown that increasing use is being made of this approach, and it is hoped that all surgeons will adopt a policy that will reduce postoperative venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. A reduction in the incidence of venous thromboembolism in large acute myocardial infarction is achieved by low dose heparin, although early mobilization is important. In addition, many of the patients at risk merit full dose anticoagulation to prevent intracardiac thromboembolism. Established venous thrombosis is treated effectively by intravenous heparin, followed by warfarin to keep the prothrombin time at 1.2 to 1.5 times control, as assessed using rabbit thromboplastin; most patients need three months of treatment. Anticoagulation is warranted for pulmonary embolism, with fibrinolytic therapy reserved for patients with massive embolism and hemodynamic compromise. Embolectomy is a heroic measure, which may occasionally be lifesaving.\r"

  ".W": "Known variously as disseminated intravascular coagulation, defibrination consumption coagulopathy or, more simply, as defibrination, disseminated intravascular coagulation is a serious epiphenomenon that occurs most often as a complicating factor of an underlying disease process. Although frequently triggered by underlying disease such as infection or tumor, if not recognized and treated appropriately, disseminated intravascular coagulation alone may lead to the patient's death as a result of hemorrhage or thrombosis, or both, of vital organs. Frequently, it may only manifest itself as an abnormality of coagulation tests, causing no immediate problem for the patient, and potentially normalizing when the inciting cause is appropriately managed. The central process that marks disseminated intravascular coagulation is the generation of thrombin in the circulating blood by means of the activation of the coagulation mechanism, leading to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, which, in turn, may lead to thrombosis mainly of the microcirculation. Because platelets and coagulation factors are consumed and fibrinolysis is enhanced during the coagulation process, hemorrhage may also ensue. Although disseminated intravascular coagulation is frequently encountered in medical and obstetric patients, the difficulty in diagnosis and controversy regarding optimal therapy are frustrating for both patient and physician. By understanding the pathophysiology of disseminated intravascular coagulation and combining clinical observation and laboratory data, one can arrive at the appropriate diagnosis. Therapy must be individualized, and assessment of the benefit versus risk ratio of intervention must be made. Early recognition of acute and life-threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation can be lifesaving with appropriate supportive measures.\r"

Although arterial thrombosis is initiated by formation of a layer of platelets on modified endothelium or subendothelial constituents and subsequent recruitment of passing-by platelets, this phenomenon is not sufficient to lead to a full thrombus. Further growth of such a platelet mass depends, to a large extent, on the presence of free thrombin. Thrombin is mainly generated by activation of factor XI on the platelet contact with collagen. In addition, thrombin leads to formation of fibrin, which maintains the stability of the arterial platelet thrombus and is the main component of the venous thrombus. The search for agents that inhibit platelet activation and thrombin formation is, therefore, a logical endeavor.\r"

  ".W": "Although many drugs have inhibitory effects on platelet function, none of them inhibits all of the mechanisms that may be involved in the various forms of thrombosis. Choice of suitable drugs is hampered by lack of full knowledge concerning the reactions that make the major contributions to the formation of arterial thrombi at sites of repeated vessel wall injury or on atherosclerotic lesions. Drugs such as aspirin that inhibit the arachidonate pathway in platelets can only be expected to be effective against thromboembolic events in which the generation of thromboxane A2 plays a major part. If thrombin and fibrin formation are dominant, oral anticoagulant agents or heparin should be beneficial; thus, experimental evidence indicates that with repeated vessel wall injury, the formation of platelet fibrin thrombi on the vessel wall is probably influenced more by inhibitors of thrombin generation than by the subendothelial constituents such as collagen. Agents like prostacyclin that raise platelet cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels in platelets by stimulating adenylate cyclase are potent inhibitors of the reaction of platelets to all aggregating and release-inducing stimuli, but these agents are not suitable for long-term administration. The effect of dipyridamole on platelet cyclic AMP levels is weak, and this drug may act through other effects on platelets or on other cells. Indeed, several of the drugs that have been tested in clinical trials may exert their effects through unrecognized mechanisms. Many combinations of drugs have been used to affect platelets or platelets and coagulation. This practice has been based on the theory that because several mechanisms may be involved in thrombus formation, combinations of drugs that inhibit different mechanisms may be beneficial.\r"

The evidence for these clinical recommendations is described and graded into five levels. The indications for anticoagulation in patients with valvular heart disease are chronic or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, sinus rhythm with a very large left atrium, severe left ventricular dysfunction or presence of heart failure or a history of previous thromboembolism. Anticoagulant therapy is administered to prolong the prothrombin time to 1.5 to 2.0 times control, using rabbit brain thromboplastin (standardized international normalized ratio = 3.0 to 4.5). Risk factors for thromboembolism in patients with prosthetic heart valves are discussed. Because intracardiac thrombus formation may start during and continues early after operation, restarting heparin therapy 6 hours after operation and continuing it for the duration of the hospitalization is advised. For mechanical prosthetic heart valves, oral anticoagulation as outlined plus dipyridamole is advised indefinitely. Platelet inhibitor therapy alone is insufficient. For bioprosthetic heart valves, heparin is followed by oral anticoagulation as outlined for 3 months after mitral or aortic valve replacement and indefinitely after mitral valve replacement if there is atrial fibrillation or a very large left atrium; aspirin may be recommended indefinitely after aortic valve replacement. Antithrombotic therapy is also considered for four special situations: noncardiac surgery, prosthetic valve endocarditis, anticoagulation after a thromboembolic event, and antithrombotic therapy during pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular injury during aortocoronary vein bypass graft surgery and arterial angioplasty initiates platelet thrombus deposition and mandates antithrombotic therapy, starting before the procedures to maximize protection against occlusion. This has been shown in studies in animals and in patients undergoing aortocoronary vein bypass graft operation where dipyridamole therapy was started before the operation, heparin was given intraoperatively and combined dipyridamole and aspirin therapy was started 7 hours after operation and markedly reduced vein graft occlusion in patients with grafts at both high and low risk for occlusion without increasing bleeding. Other alternative regimens, particularly preoperative dipyridamole followed postoperatively with aspirin alone, offer a promising future. Therapy should be continued for at least 1 year and perhaps indefinitely. Control of coronary risk factors appears important for long-term therapy to try to retard the atherosclerotic and occlusive process that leads to approximately 50% vein graft attrition by 10 years after operation. The possible role of cod liver oil and internal mammary artery bypass is discussed. Arterial angioplasty appears to cause deep arterial injury that activates both platelets and the coagulation system. These potentiate each other to form macroscopic mural thrombus within 1 hour in more than 90% of arteries that manifested deep arterial injury in pigs. Acute platelet thrombus deposition was retarded but not eliminated by only certain platelet-inhibitor agents. Implications for ongoing trials, current empiric therapy and future therapy are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The role of platelets and the clotting system in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis has received significant attention. Most importantly, platelets and thrombosis play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the acute coronary syndromes of unstable angina, myocardial infarction and sudden death. In each stage of the development of coronary artery disease, from the early symptomatic stage through the growing lesion and finally to the complicated plaque that results in the precipitation of the acute coronary syndromes, platelets and the clotting system serve as a common link among them. Antithrombotic therapy aimed at halting the progression of these syndromes, preventing their occurrence or even reversing them (such as in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction), has provided exciting new modalities to treat these disorders. The use of aspirin in unstable angina in two well designed studies has clearly shown a reduction in fatal as well as nonfatal cardiac events compared with control groups not treated with aspirin. Although demonstration of a benefit of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is difficult owing to a low event rate of thrombotic events (low sensitivity) and other nonthrombotic fatal events (low specificity) after myocardial infarction, pooled results have shown a favorable effect with their use. The usefulness of thrombolytic therapy in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction depends on the timing of initiation of therapy, the severity of the residual stenosis and possible use of agents that protect the ischemic myocardium. Other potential therapies for the acute coronary syndromes are also suggested. Further studies are in progress to establish the clinical benefits of antithrombotic agents in acute coronary syndromes.\r"

  ".W": "In a number of cardiac conditions (acute myocardial infarction, chronic left ventricular aneurysm, dilated cardiomyopathy, infective endocarditis and atrial fibrillation in the absence of valvular disease), the risk of embolism gives cause for concern. Although anticoagulation with warfarin (Coumadin)-derivatives has been shown to be effective in some of these situations, there is no evidence regarding the role of antiplatelet agents. The common factor in the thromboembolic potential of acute myocardial infarction, chronic left ventricular aneurysm and dilated cardiomyopathy is mural thrombus. This can be detected by two-dimensional echocardiography and indium-111 platelet scintigraphy. Although of value in elucidating the natural history of mural thrombus, in most cases, management is not substantially aided by these investigations. In patients with extensive myocardial infarction, particularly anterior infarction, moderate intensity anticoagulation started soon after hospital admission reduces the rate of embolism. After 8 to 12 weeks, embolic risk is low so that anticoagulants can usually be discontinued. Patients with chronic left ventricular aneurysm have a low incidence of embolism; anticoagulation is, therefore, inappropriate. Dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with a high risk of embolism; moderate intensity anticoagulation may be advisable in many such cases. Little information is available regarding the incidence of thromboembolism or the role of antithrombotic therapy in the patient with a diffusely dilated left ventricle due to ischemic heart disease. In native valve infective endocarditis, the risk of hemorrhage is high, and the efficacy of conventional anticoagulants unclear; thus, anticoagulation should not be instituted for the cardiac condition as such. However, in prosthetic valve endocarditis, the risk of embolism seems to be very high, and anticoagulant therapy should be continued, but with great care because there is a substantial risk of cerebral hemorrhage. Atrial fibrillation in patients with valvular heart disease is dealt with in a previous review. Patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation are at varying risk of embolism, depending on the etiology of the arrhythmia; trials of antithrombotic therapy are needed for the various subsets of patients. In most elderly patients, the etiology is not known, and their stroke risk is high. The risk of embolism in younger patients with idiopathic atrial fibrillation is so low as to make any antithrombotic therapy unnecessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

According to previous randomized trials, transient ischemic attacks should be managed with aspirin, 1.0 to 1.5 g daily, pending the results of studies of smaller aspirin doses and other platelet-active drugs. In patients with a suspected cardiogenic brain embolus, anticoagulation should be withheld pending the results of a computed tomographic scan done 24 to 48 hours from onset. If there is no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation or a large area of infarction and the patient does not have sustained hypertension, heparin therapy should be initiated in an effort to prevent a recurrent embolus.\r"

  ".W": "Atherosclerosis complicated by thromboembolism is the main cause of obstructive arterial disease in the legs. Two studies from West Germany suggest that antiplatelet drugs may slow the progress of atherosclerosis in leg arteries and prevent occlusive thrombosis under some circumstances. The same agents may also reduce the risk of rethrombosis after successful vascular repair in the femoropopliteal region; in one trial, aspirin decreased the incidence of reocclusion after thromboendarterectomy and, in another, the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole was effective after bypass with synthetic material. Antithrombotic drugs are used in most centers after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, but there is no definite evidence for their need. Thus, it appears that in contrast to cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, few efforts have been made to determine the true value of antithrombotic therapy in peripheral arterial disease. The management of acute thromboembolism in the legs requires a multidisciplinary approach. Depending on the type (embolic or thrombotic), length and localization of the arterial occlusion, surgical (embolectomy, thromboendarterectomy, peripheral bypass surgery) or nonsurgical (systemic fibrinolysis or local thrombolytic therapy with or without balloon angioplasty) treatment is preferred. The importance of nonsurgical therapeutic approaches may become even greater in elderly patients with a poor operative risk. This review discusses the available therapeutic modalities in acute and chronic peripheral thromboembolic arterial disease.\r"

  ".U": "87058563\r", 
  ".W": "Consideration of the origin of airway hyperresponsiveness appears central to understanding the origin of asthma. Subjects with and without asthma differ both in the ease with which airway narrowing is produced by inhalation of histamine or methacholine and in the ability to demonstrate a maximal response to these agents. The latter appears, on present evidence, to be due to an added mechanism in asthma rather than the absence of a potent inhibitory process. Airway hyperresponsiveness is probably acquired during life as a result of airway reactions to various stimuli, although genetic factors such as atopy are likely to predispose the person to develop hyperresponsiveness. Environmental stimuli include inhaled allergens, chemical sensitizers, airway infections, immunization, and ozone. Allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness occurs in association with late-phase asthmatic responses. This and ozone-induced hyperresponsiveness have been demonstrated to be associated with release of chemical mediators and the cellular phase of inflammation. Their effect does not appear to be accounted for by increase in airway epithelial permeability, decrease in airway caliber, reflex bronchoconstriction, or beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The mechanism(s) responsible for the induced hyperresponsiveness are unknown but may involve airway epithelial damage, edema in and around the airway walls, stimulation of the noncholinergic excitatory or inhibition of the nonadrenergic inhibitory systems, or a change in function of airway smooth muscle. Airway hyperresponsiveness can be transient or persistent. Transient increases in responsiveness are almost certainly associated with mediator release and inflammation. It is not known whether persistent hyperresponsiveness is due to the same process, fired, for example, by leaky mediator-releasing cells and/or to some persisting change in neurogenic or smooth muscle function.\r"

One-week premedication with theophylline led to serum levels in the therapeutic range (8 to 21 micrograms/ml). There were significant reductions in both the physiologic response to antigen challenge and the appearance of mediators in secretions after drug administration as compared to placebo. These data suggest that theophylline, at therapeutic blood levels, achieves at least part of its in vivo efficacy by reducing the release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells/basophils.\r"

In testing for the prevalence of IgE antibodies to these enzymes in sera among 300 laundry product workers, we experienced two problems in the establishment of a reliable RAST for these antigens. The first problem was the propensity of the allergen, Esperase, to undergo autolysis, suggesting that solid-phase Esperase might also lose reactivity through degradation. Treatment of Esperase with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride stabilized the enzyme and permitted the synthesis of a stable solid-phase antigen. The second problem was the finding that sera reactive with Esperase in the RAST were also reactive with Savinase, an enzyme from B. licheniformis to which the workers were not exposed. Immunochemical analyses of the three enzymes with specific rabbit antisera by gel diffusion and by two-site immunoradiometric assay demonstrated that they were not cross contaminated to any appreciable extent. RAST inhibition demonstrated that solid-phase Esperase possessed unique allergenic determinants in that the reactivity of IgE antibodies was inhibited by low concentrations of Esperase and only by very high concentrations of Alcalase and Savinase. In contrast, the reactivity of solid-phase Alcalase was occasionally inhibited equally well by Esperase and Alcalase. Most strikingly, the reaction of IgE antibodies with solid-phase Savinase was always inhibited by comparable quantities of Esperase, Alcalase, and Savinase. Thus, the establishment of the RAST for these proteases appears to require the use of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to retard autolysis, and the results must be interpreted with caution because IgE antibodies in certain sera demonstrate cross-reactivity with Alcalase and Savinase.\r"

Multiple regression analysis of data demonstrated that both early asthmatic reaction, expressed as the allergen Pd15, and late asthmatic reaction, expressed as the FEV1 maximum fall from control values, can be predicted with similar accuracy (explained variance of 63% and 68%, respectively) by a model that incorporates simultaneously methacholine Pd15, percent of total radioactivity added by RAST, and baseline values of FEV1. We conclude that the late asthmatic reaction is more likely to occur and is more severe in patients with more severe underlying disease.\r"

On 3 separate days, allergen, exercise, and UNDW challenges were performed 2 hours after methacholine. FEV1 was measured for 8 hours to detect any delayed change in airway caliber. If there were a further significant reduction in FEV1 after the recovery from the immediate bronchoconstriction, methacholine challenge was performed again when FEV1 had returned to baseline. Reproducibility of any observed late response to exercise and UNDW was also investigated by repeating these challenges on 2 subsequent days. After allergen inhalation only nine subjects had an early asthmatic response, whereas all the tested subjects demonstrated a late reaction and increased methacholine responsiveness. Ten subjects had an immediate response to exercise, and this was followed by a late response in only four patients. Nine subjects demonstrated early response to UNDW inhalation, and five subjects also had a late reaction. These late responses were associated with an increase in methacholine responsiveness in a subset of the tested subjects. Late-phase reactions to exercise and UNDW were not reproducible.\r"

Theophylline was also associated with improved verbal learning but decreased motor steadiness. Metabolic effects associated with theophylline included lower serum bicarbonate, greater urinary calcium excretion, and higher serum calcium, uric acid, and creatinine. Albuterol was associated with lower neutrophil counts and lower serum theophylline concentrations. There were no drug-induced effects on cardiac rhythm.\r"

In a double-blind manner, one patient in each pair was treated in nine weekly visits with 13 injections that totaled 24,000 PNU of each grass to which the patient had cutaneous reactivity. The other patient in each pair received caramelized glucose histamine placebo. Symptom and medication score sheets were completed by 33 patients each day of the grass season. Blocking antibody rose significantly in the IPG-treated group but was unchanged in the placebo-treated group. By Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test, the symptom medication scores in the IPG-treated group were significantly lower than those in the placebo-treated group. There were no systemic reactions and no clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests in either group. In summation, this study demonstrates the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of IPG therapy in an accelerated dosage schedule for treatment of grass pollinosis.\r"

Four such supporters received no special training. A videotape dramatizing typical problem situations encountered with a demented family member was used to elicit information about supporters' coping styles. Post-training and six-month follow-up evaluation indicated improvements among trained individuals on measures related to assertiveness, problem solving, and stress reduction. Trained subjects' estimates of the length of time they would be able to cope with problems involved in caring for their relatives also increased. Few such improvements occurred among untrained subjects. These results suggest the usefulness of brief structured skills training programs in helping supporters to improve their coping abilities.\r"

Twenty-eight weeks after the first vaccination, anti-HBs was detected in 70 of the 75 subjects (93%). The anti-HBs response was more marked in females and in younger people, but the differences between males and females and between the younger and older groups were not statistically significant. In subjects under 10 years of age, an adequate anti-HBs response was obtained with 10 micrograms of HBsAg protein. There was no clear correlation between the anti-HBs response and the HLA haplotype, because even the siblings who showed the same low anti-HBs response did not have the same HLA haplotype in common, and a difference was observed in the anti-HBs response even among siblings who had the same two HLA haplotypes.\r"

  ".U": "87058921\r", 
  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that treatment of (C57BL/6 X A)F1 (F1) recipient mice with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (pI:C) before injection with 30 X 10(6) C57BL/6 (B6) lymphocytes prevents both the immunosuppression and pathologic lesions typical of graft-vs-host (GVH) reactions. We now report the further characterization of this phenomenon. Donor spleen and lymph node cells were labeled with fluorescein in vitro and injected into pI:C-treated or untreated mice. Two days later, recipient splenocytes were analyzed for the presence of fluorescein-labeled donor cells by flow microfluorometry. Treatment of F1 mice with pI:C resulted in a sharp reduction in the recovery of labeled B6 but not A strain parental cells. Treatment with pI:C had no effect when syngeneic recipients were used, or when F1 cells were injected into A, B6, or F1 recipients. These results suggest that pI:C treatment induces rejection of B6 but not A or F1 lymphocytes by F1 hybrid mice at least as early as 2 days after donor cell transfer. As F1 cells are not rejected by either parent, rejection does not seem to be directed against classical alloantigens. These observations are compatible with the previously described model of hybrid resistance (HR) against bone marrow grafts. The rapidity of rejection strongly suggested that natural cytotoxic mechanisms were involved, thus, natural killer (NK) cell and macrophage (M phi) cytotoxic activities were tested throughout the time when the parental cell graft was being rejected. Over this period, pI:C treatment increased cytotoxic activity against the NK-sensitive target cell line YAC-1 but had no effect on spontaneous M phi tumoricidal activity against the L5178Y and MDAY-D2 cell lines. The results suggest that NK cells, but not M phi, may be involved in the elimination of B6 parental cells by the pI:C-treated F1 mice. NK cells have been demonstrated to be radioresistant; thus, as a test of our hypothesis, we examined the effects of irradiation on the capacity of pI:C treated F1 mice to reject B6 lymphocytes. The results show that this capacity was not blocked by 750 cGy, a dose of radiation that abrogates most T and B cell functions. Furthermore, rejection of parental cells could be prevented by treatment of recipient F1 mice with antibodies to asialo GM1, a treatment that suppresses NK activity. These data demonstrate that pI:C-mediated protection from GVH-induced changes is due to increased rejection of grafted B6 parental cells by F1 NK cells, a phenomenon very similar, if not identical, to HR to bone marrow grafts.\r"

  ".W": "To study the possible involvement of human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-related agent in Japanese multiple sclerosis (MS), we performed a Western blotting analysis, using purified viral antigens, on sera from 46 patients with MS, nine patients with other neurologic diseases, and 11 healthy controls. Of 46 MS patients, 11 (24%) had antibodies reactive with antigens corresponding to the group-specific antigen (gag) proteins (p15, p19, and p24), although the prevalence was lower than that reported in a recent study using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Despite the lower frequency of immunoreactivity, Western blotting technique had merits of identification of multiple antigens and higher specificity for detection of antibodies than ELISA. Those sero-positive patients consisted of four cases with IgG antibodies reactive mainly to the gag p24 and/or p15, four with IgM antibodies mainly to the gag p24 and/or p19, and three with both IgG and IgM antibodies. These immunostaining patterns of MS sera were clearly distinguishable from those of adult T cell leukemia patients who had antibodies to the envelope (env) proteins and its precursors in addition to the gag proteins. The antibody in MS sera was generally of low titer and reactive at a high serum concentration (1/10 dilution). None of the sera from patients with other neurologic diseases and healthy controls had the viral antibodies. These findings indicate that at least one quarter of Japanese MS patients have antibody responses to a hitherto unidentified agent related to HTLV-I, which possibly plays a part, primarily or secondarily, in the pathogenesis of those patients.\r"

  ".W": "Receptors for C3 degradation fragments (CR1, CR2, and CR3) are present on many human cells including phagocytes and lymphoid cells and may be critical in the attachment of invading microorganisms. In these studies Candida were found to mimic the human CR by binding erythrocytes coated with specific human C3 fragments. Yeast forms of Candida species were adhered to glass slides and were allowed to germinate. Sheep erythrocytes (E) were coated with IgM (EA) and human complement components to prepare EA, EAC14, EAC3b, EAC3bi, and EAC3d. These test cells were then examined for adherence to the organism. Antibodies to human CR1, CR2, and CR3 were used to evaluate their potential for blocking adherence of the test erythrocytes to Candida. Fluorescein-labeled antibodies to human complement receptors were also used to characterize the binding sites. EAC3bi and EAC3d, but not E, EA, or EAC14, bound extensively to the germ tubes and pseudohyphae of Candida albicans and C. stellatoidea. EAC3b bound infrequently. Other Candida species, generally considered less pathogenic, bound significantly fewer specific test erythrocytes than C. albicans. Monoclonal antibodies to human CR1 and CR3 (3D9, 1B4, C511, 2B6, anti-B2, Mo1, and anti-Mac-1), in general, did not block adherence of test erythrocytes. Blocking of adherence of EAC3bi and EAC3d test erythrocytes coated with small quantities of C3 fragments occurred with high concentrations of monoclonal (anti-CR2) HB-5 and polyclonal (anti-CR2) anti-GP 140. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated binding of Mo-1 to the germinated forms of the organism, whereas binding of the other antibodies was not seen. These studies suggest a surface constituent on the organism similar to CR on human cells. Additional studies are necessary to further define the molecular nature of the binding site. The ability of organisms to mimic human CR may be more generalized than previously known and may serve as a mechanism for modification of the inflammatory and immune response.\r"

Vaccine antibodies also immunoprecipitated a single 97k molecule, with a pI of 5.5, from detergent extracts of [35S] methionine-labeled schistosomes. Three hybridomas, produced from spleen cells of i.d. immunized mice, all recognized both the 95k/78k doublet and the 97k antigen, indicating that the two lower Mr components are degradation products of the same 97k molecule. The 97k/95k/78k complex (Sm-97) was purified by affinity chromatography and found to constitute 0.5% of the total protein in SWAP. 125I-concanavalin A bound weakly to purified Sm-97, indicating that this antigen is minimally glycosylated. By indirect immunofluorescence, Sm-97 was localized to regions just below the tegumental and gut syncitia of adult worms. Mice protected by i.d. vaccination produced high titers (1:10,240) of anti-Sm-97 antibodies, whereas chronically infected mice responded at a much lower level (titer 1:640). In contrast, mice protectively immunized with irradiated cercariae and mice nonprophylactically inoculated by the i.v. route failed to produce detectable anti-Sm-97 antibodies. Competitive radioimmunoassays performed with 125I-labeled monoclonal antibodies and purified antigen defined at least two distinct epitopes on Sm-97. Antibodies from i.d. vaccinated mice recognized both monoclonal antibody-defined epitopes, whereas anti-Sm-97 antibodies in chronic infection sera recognized neither. Finally, purified Sm-97 was shown to elicit delayed-type hypersensitivity in i.d. vaccinated mice, suggesting that this molecule is also capable of evoking cell-mediated responses, a finding consistent with its proposed function as a vaccine immunogen.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the fine specificity of anti-lipid A antibodies to identify conserved lipid A antigens. Because lipid A derived from many different Gram-negative bacteria has similar biologic activities, the conserved regions may be of particular importance for the immunostimulatory and toxic properties of lipid A. We found that five of nine antibodies bound to a wide variety of Gram-negative bacteria. All these widely cross-reactive antibodies bound to the same antigenic site within lipid A. Polymyxin B, an inhibitor of lipid A activity, bound to this site as well. The widely cross-reactive antibodies bound to native and base-hydrolyzed lipid A equally well, and also bound to the monosaccharide precursor lipid X. The less cross-reactive antibodies recognized base-hydrolyzed lipid A poorly, and did not recognize lipid X at all. Other investigators have shown that lipid X has some of the activities of lipid A in vitro and can inhibit the lethal toxicity of LPS in vivo. On the basis of this study, we suggest that lipid X contains a conserved lipid A epitope as well.\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports have demonstrated that natural killer (NK) cells are capable of inhibiting the growth of Cryptococcus neoformans in vitro, and recent studies indicate that adoptively transferred NK cell-enriched spleen cell populations enhance clearance of cryptococci from the tissues of cyclophosphamide-pretreated recipients. The primary objective of these studies was to confirm that NK cells participate in early clearance of C. neoformans in vivo. Secondarily, the anti-cryptococcal activities of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages were examined. Seven-week-old C57BL/6 bg/+ mice, which have normal levels of NK cell activity, were compared with their bg/bg littermates, which have impaired NK cell function. One and 3 days after injecting both groups of mice i.v. with 2 X 10(4) cryptococci, we assessed the NK cell activities in spleens, lungs, and livers and clearance of the organism from corresponding tissues as determined by the mean log10 numbers of cryptococcal colony-forming units (CFU) per organ. Three days postinfection, the mean numbers of cryptococcal CFU in lungs and spleens of bg/+ mice were significantly lower than in the corresponding organs of bg/bg mice. NK cell activities in spleens and lungs of bg/+ mice were significantly higher than were the NK cell activities in similar cell populations from bg/bg mice. In contrast, the mean numbers of cryptococcal CFU in livers of the two groups of animals were nearly equivalent, a situation not unexpected, since liver NK cell activities were extremely low and similar in both groups of animals. Although these data indicated a correlation between early clearance of cryptococci from tissues and levels of NK cell activities in the corresponding tissues, it was also possible that differences in phagocytic cell function between the bg/+ and bg/bg animals could account for the observed differences in clearance of cryptococci from the tissues. Therefore, phagocytic cells from the two groups of animals were compared with respect to their abilities to phagocytize and inhibit the growth of cryptococci and to their abilities to respond to chemotactic stimuli in vivo. Peritoneal PMNL from bg/+ and bg/bg mice were similar in their abilities to phagocytize and inhibit the growth of cryptococci, as well as in their chemotactic responses to viable cryptococci or sodium caseinate. In addition, there were no differences in splenic macrophage functions between the two groups of mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

R-IL 1 alone, as well as in synergy with alpha IgM mab or DXS, respectively, stimulated the growth of low-density B cells. Moreover, r-IL 1 and alpha IgM mab costimulated replication of high-density B cells. Separated B cell populations (1 X 10(5) cells/well) were cultured with r-IL 1 alone or in combination with DXS or alpha IgM mab, respectively, and the generation of plaque-forming cells was determined. R-IL 1 alone, as well as in synergy with DXS, stimulated the differentiation of low-density B cells into Ig-secreting cells. These findings suggest that r-IL 1 has B cell growth and differentiation factor activity and is operative on high- and low-density B cells. Thus, IL 1 may play an important role in B cell growth and maturation.\r"

  ".W": "A human autoreactive T cell line named Bur-1 has been obtained from a woman 4 mo after an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from one of her HLA-identical brothers. The phenotype of the cell line is 100% T11+ and over 90% T4+, and the karyotype confirms its donor (male) origin. These donor T cells proliferate specifically in the presence of donor's peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) but not recipient's cells, and they kill specifically donor's but not recipient's Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). PBM from another HLA-identical brother and from several unrelated donors also stimulate Bur-1 cells, and EBV-induced LCL from the same donors are killed in cytotoxicity assays. All of these donors share HLA-DR5 or HLA-DRw11 (the major split of HLA-DR5) with Bur-1 cells. However, some but not all of the PBM sharing HLA-DR5 with Bur-1 cells are recognized. Therefore, in contrast with the previously described autoreactive T cells, Bur-1 cells are not directed against self-MHC antigens but rather recognize autologous minor histocompatibility (mH) antigens in the context of autologous HLA class II molecules. Because both male and female cells can be recognized, the reacting minor antigen could not be the male-specific HY antigen. It is suggested that autoreactivity against mH antigens can be observed in bone marrow-grafted patients due to the education of bone marrow donor precursors in the recipient thymus not allowing tolerance to autologous (donor) mH antigens not shared by the recipient.\r"

  ".W": "There is a high prevalence of islet cell antibodies (ICA) and autoantibodies detected against an islet cell protein of Mr 64,000 at the time of clinical diagnosis of insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM). In view of the biphasic immune response after antigen presentation, the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of ICA and antibodies against the 64,000 islet antigen after separation of IgM from IgG to prevent interference between the two antibody classes. Plasma samples from 10 newly diagnosed IDDM children and 10 healthy controls were precipitated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the crude Ig was subjected to Sephacryl S-300 chromatography to separate IgM and IgG. ICA determined by indirect immunofluorescence on frozen sections of human pancreas showed reduced background immunofluorescence intensity in the purified fractions compared with crude plasma. The number of ICA-positive samples among the IDDM patients increased from 7/10 in plasma to 9/10 in the IgG fraction. There was an increase in the ICA titer in 6/9 of the positive samples. All purified IgM samples were ICA negative. Immunoprecipitation experiments by using Nonidet P-40 detergent lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled neonatal rat islets demonstrated that the 64,000 autoantibodies were in the IgG fraction. We found 7/10 IDDM samples to be positive, whereas all controls were negative. The background in the autoradiographic analysis was markedly reduced in the IgG fractions compared with immunoprecipitates with crude or PEG-purified plasma and the IgM fraction. ICA titers did not correlate to the ability of the IgG fraction to precipitate the 64,000 autoantigen. It is concluded that both the ICA and 64,000 autoantibodies are primarily of the IgG class at the time of clinical onset of IDDM, and that purification of IgG from human IDDM plasma facilitates the detection of the rat islet cell 64,000 antigen.\r"

By indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, anti-PM-Scl antibodies stained the nucleolus in cells of different tissues and species, suggesting that the antigen is highly conserved. By electron microscopy, anti-PM-Scl antibodies reacted primarily with the granular component of the nucleolus. Drugs that inhibit rRNA synthesis had a marked effect on the expression of PM-Scl antigen. In actinomycin D-treated cells, immunofluorescence staining by anti-PM-Scl was significantly reduced with residual staining restricted to the granular regions of nucleoli. Treatment with 5,6-dichloro-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) also selectively reduced nucleolar staining. On a molecular level, anti-PM-Scl antibodies precipitated 11 polypeptides with molecular weights (Mr) ranging from 110,000 to 20,000. The Mr 80,000 and 20,000 polypeptides were phosphorylated. Evidence suggests that the PM-Scl antigen complex may be related to a preribosomal particle.\r"

In contrast, by fluorescence on frozen sections of tadpoles and by immunoprecipitation, the class I molecule is not detected in tadpoles, but appears on all tissues at the climax of metamorphosis. Animals maintained as tadpoles for long periods of time by chemical treatment do express class I antigens; thus, their expression can be independent of other biochemical and morphological changes that occur at metamorphosis. Immunofluorescence detects an otherwise uncharacterized MHC-linked alloantigen on tadpole thymic epithelium from the earliest stages of thymus differentiation.\r"

Resident macrophage ganglioside patterns from C3H/HeJ mice (endotoxin hyporesponsive) and C3H/HeN mice (endotoxin responsive) were similar. Macrophages elicited with phenol-extracted or butanol-extracted endotoxin showed distinctly more complex ganglioside patterns in C3H/HeN mice. C3H/HeJ macrophages showed distinct, but less complex changes when elicited with butanol-extracted endotoxin. As expected, there were minimal alterations induced by phenol-extracted endotoxin in the C3H/HeJ patterns. When injected with whole killed E. coli, both strains of mice exhibited complex ganglioside patterns; however, there were relative differences in the quantities of multiple gangliosides. Differences in ganglioside patterns were mirrored in the relative ratios of N-acetyl- to N-glycolylneuraminic acid. When macrophages were activated by administration of either endotoxin preparation, macrophage gangliosides from C3H/HeN mice always contained a higher proportion of N-acetylneuraminic acid compared with C3H/HeJ macrophage gangliosides. Oxidative metabolism of the macrophage populations was assessed by PMA-induced H2O2 release. This indicated that endotoxin activation produced an increase in PMA-induced H2O2 release as well as a shift of sialic acid class from the N-glycolyl type to the N-acetyl type. However, no direct correlation could be made between ganglioside composition, sialic acid content, and macrophage function. These data indicate that both ganglioside composition and sialic acid composition of macrophages are profoundly altered with endotoxin activation. The data further indicate that under conditions which C3H/HeJ mice respond to Gram-negative bacteria, their macrophage ganglioside patterns still differ from normal mice.\r"

These mice are thought to be models of various human autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus, Sjogren's syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. We have used cyclosporin A (CS-A) treatment as a tool by which the mechanisms of immune-mediated pathology might be dissected. CS-A was used because of its known preferential inhibition of T cell function and the marked expansion in MRL-lpr/lpr mice of an unusual L3T4-, Lyt-2-, 6B2+ T cell population. CS-A prevented lymphadenopathy and expansion of L3T4-, Lyt-2-, 6B2+ T cells in the peripheral lymph nodes, and also in the thymus. The increased expression of the c-myb and T cell receptor beta-chain genes associated with these unusual cells was also corrected. The finding of increased numbers of L3T4-, Lyt-2-, 6B2+ thymocytes in untreated mice suggests abnormal intrathymic differentiation in lpr/lpr mice, a defect that was corrected by CS-A. Treated mice had a marked decrease in arthritis and glomerulonephritis and significantly prolonged survival. These beneficial effects of CS-A occurred despite a lack of reduction in antibodies reactive with DNA, circulating immune complexes, rheumatoid factor titers, or immunoglobulin concentrations. These results demonstrate that the B cell hyperactivity of MRL-lpr/lpr mice can proceed without the T cell proliferative disease.\r"

We found that substantial proliferative responses to Ia antigens of the recipient strain and also to third party antigens were generated by the thymocytes obtained from the irradiation chimeras at an early stage after bone marrow reconstitution. The majority of the responding thymocytes had surfaces lacking demonstrable peanut agglutinin receptors and were donor type Thy-1+, Ly-2-, and L3T4+ in both anti-recipient and anti-third party MLR. In anti-host responses, however, Ly-2+ thymocytes seemed to be at least partially involved. This capacity of thymus cells to mount a response to antigens of the recipient strain declined shortly thereafter, whereas the capacity to mount MLR against third party antigens persisted. The spleen cells of [B10----AKR] chimeras at the same time developed a more durable capability to exhibit anti-host reactivities and a permanent capability of reacting to third party allo-antigens. The stimulator antigens were Ia molecules on the stimulator cells in both anti-recipient and anti-third party MLR. The responding splenocytes were of donor origin and most of them had Thy-1+, Ly-1+2-, and L3T4+ phenotype.\r"

Changes in laminin receptor expression are stimulus dose dependent at both chemotactic (10(-10) M to 10(-6) M) concentrations of FMLP, and secretory (greater than 5 ng/ml) levels of PMA. In the presence of cytochalasin B (5 micrograms/ml), 10(-7) M FMLP activation stimulates specific laminin binding, with an apparent Kd = 3.9 X 10(-9) M and 6.47 X 10(5) binding sites/cell, reaching equilibrium within 10 min at 4 degrees C. This observed activation-dependent change in laminin receptor expression is not due to interference by endogenous laminin, because no fluorescein-visualized anti-laminin antibody bound to cells without added glycoprotein, regardless of the level of activation. Levels of neutrophil lysozyme release, which show a PMA dose dependence similar to that of receptor binding activity, suggest that granule-plasma membrane fusion may be significant during increases in receptor expression. A lack of receptor stimulation by PMA from a granule-deficient patient or in granule-depleted cytoplasts from normal donors additionally supports this hypothesis. Electroblot transfer and autoradiography of subcellular fractions from unstimulated PMN reveals the presence of a 68,000 dalton laminin-binding component in the secondary/tertiary granule (beta) fraction, which may represent an intracellular laminin receptor pool.\r"

  ".W": "Enhancement of binding of one monoclonal antibody to an antigen in the presence of a second monoclonal antibody (specific for an independent epitope on the same antigen) has been observed for several antigen-antibody systems involving primarily protein, or glycoprotein, antigens. We have analyzed the interaction between radiolabeled IgG3 kappa anti-streptococcal group A carbohydrate (GAC) antibody (125I-HGAC 39) and streptococcal group A vaccine (GAV; traditionally used to elicit anti-GAC antibody) in the absence and presence of unlabeled anti-GAC antibodies, anti-isotypic antibodies, or anti-idiotypic antibodies, respectively. A variety of significant enhancing or inhibiting effects on the binding of 125I-HGAC 39 to solid-phase GAV (GAVsp) were noted. First, high concentrations of IgG3 anti-GAC antibodies specifically inhibit binding of 125I-HGAC 39 to GAVsp, but the presence of lower concentrations of IgG3 anti-GAC antibodies is associated with markedly increased (up to 300 to 400%) binding of 125I-HGAC 39 to GAVsp. In contrast, with the concentrations used, IgM anti-GAC antibodies only inhibit binding of 125I-HGAC 39 to GAVsp. A monoclonal anti-gamma 3 antibody (2E.6) also enhances binding (up to 700%) of 125I-HGAC 39 to GAVsp, whereas another high-affinity anti-isotypic antibody, anti-C kappa (187.1), only inhibits binding of 125I-HGAC 39 to GAVsp. In a similar manner, an antiidiotypic antibody (anti-IdX) specific for a framework idiotope located near the C kappa domain inhibits the interaction between 125I-HGAC 39 and GAVsp. Evidence is presented to suggest that neither anti-C kappa nor anti-IdX blocks the HGAC 39 paratope, and therefore, the inhibition of binding mediated by these antibodies must be on some other basis. An alternative explanation for this effect, on the basis of the impairment of functional bivalency of 125I-HGAC 39, is discussed. Finally, anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-IdI-3a and anti-IdI-1) that bind closer to the antigen-binding site of HGAC 39 inhibit binding of 125I-HGAC 39 to GAVsp in a manner that is most readily interpreted as competition for the GAC-binding site (or nearby sites) on the HGAC 39 variable domain. These effects are shown to require specific immunologic recognition of either GAVsp or 125I-HGAC 39.\r"

  ".U": "87059062\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have identified a lymphokine, termed Ts differentiation factor (TsDF), in primary MLR supernatants that induces effector function of alloantigen-primed MLR-Ts. The present report describes constitutive production of TsDF by the murine thymoma BW5147, and its use to analyze alloantigen and TsDF requirements for MLR-Ts activation to TsF production. Serum-free supernatants of BW5147 restored the capacity of MLR-TsF production to alloantigen-primed MLR-Ts cultured with glutaraldehyde-fixed allogeneic stimulator cells, and were not themselves directly suppressive in the MLR assay. BW5147 supernatant induced MLR-TsF production from primed L3T4-Ly2+ MLR-Ts in the absence of concomitant proliferation, suggesting that the function of BW5147 supernatant, like that of MLR-derived TsDF, is a differentiative rather than a proliferative one, and is required for the synthesis or release of TsF. The differentiative activity of BW5147 supernatant was associated with a molecular species of approximately 14,500 m.w. by HPLC fractionation and was expressed independently of detectable IL 2, IL 3, IFN-gamma, and IL 1. The functional activity of BW5147 supernatant has therefore been provisionally designated BW5147-derived Ts differentiative factor, or BW-TsDF. By using BW-TsDF, it was demonstrated that MLR-Ts fail to respond to TsDF in the absence of, or preceding, reexposure to priming alloantigen. Instead, alloantigen binding by primed MLR-Ts appears to create a transient state of TsDF responsiveness. Primed MLR-Ts were fully sensitive to delayed addition of TsDF for approximately 12 hr after reexposure to alloantigen, but became TsDF-unresponsive within 24 to 36 hr. MLR-Ts cultured alone for 36 hr were fully responsive to the combined addition of TsDF and alloantigen. Thus, MLR-Ts activation to TsF release requires the sequential events of specific alloantigen binding, which induces a TsDF-responsive state, followed by interaction with TsDF. The transience of induced TsDF responsiveness suggests a precise mechanism for control of antigen-initiated Ts activation to effector function.\r"

This clone lysed syngeneic target cells in which native beta 2M-A molecules had been exchanged with beta 2M-B molecules by incubating the cells in serum from beta 2M-B-positive mouse strains. Conversely, the CTL clone GA5 failed to lyse its specific target when beta 2M-B molecules had been exchanged with beta 2M-A molecules by incubating the cells in serum from beta 2M-A-positive, beta 2M-B-negative mouse strains. Strain combinations were chosen so as to limit reactivity to beta 2M and to preclude reactivity to H-3 antigens, thus indicating CTL clone GA5 to be reacting specifically with beta 2M-B.\r"

  ".W": "Ichthyols are sulfated shale oils with well-known anti-inflammatory effects in dermatologic diseases. Their possible mechanisms of action were studied by measuring chemotactic factor release from peripheral human leukocytes in vitro. Ichthyols caused no release of such factors by themselves but inhibited ionophore-induced release. After elution of the cell supernatants on reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, followed by analysis of the fractions in the chemotaxis assay and the radioimmunoassay, Ichthyols caused a reduction of lipids at marker positions for leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and 20-COOH-LTB4. The inhibition was also evident in the LTB4 radioimmunoassay, was dose- and time-dependent, and occurred in noncytotoxic concentrations of the agents. Ichthyols also inhibit the chemotactic response of neutrophils toward LTB4 and the unstimulated migration of cells. These inhibitory effects of Ichthyols on secretion of chemotactic arachidonate metabolites from leukocytes and on cell migration provide a plausible explanation for their anti-inflammatory activity.\r"

Eleven of 18 children with positive sera were put on a gluten-free diet (GFD) and their sera became negative. One of these 11 patients was challenged with gluten and the antibody reappeared. Nineteen patients examined only on a GFD and 30 healthy blood donors did not have this antibody. There was no strict correlation between the titer of antibody and the severity of jejunal mucosal damage.\r"

Since HLA-DQ expression has been positively correlated with the ability to present nominal antigen, our findings would suggest the possibility that epidermal Langerhans cells, like other members of the human dendritic cell series, might be more efficient than monocytes at nominal antigen presentation since only about 50% of peripheral blood monocytes express HLA-DQ molecules.\r"

The factors involved in this accelerated muscle breakdown have not been fully described. However, recently leukocytic pyrogen or interleukin 1 (IL-1) have been implicated in the induction of muscle protein degradation in septicemia or trauma. The epidermal cytokine epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF) is biochemically and functionally similar to IL-1. Injury to skin can augment ETAF activity. Using a murine model, we found that thermal injury can significantly enhance ETAF/IL-1 activity in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, ETAF can cause net muscle protein breakdown in vitro. Thus, increased amounts of ETAF produced by thermally injured skin may contribute to the accelerated muscle breakdown in extensive thermal injury.\r"

No reaction products could be found beneath the melanocytes in any of the first 2 groups; however, positive reaction products were found on the basal lamina beneath some melanocytes, and were associated with the detached basal lamina in the dermis in the latter 4 cases. In vitro binding sites of circulating anti-BMZ antibodies in the sera from 7 patients with BP indicated that the antibodies reacted with the basilar surface of the hemidesmosomes, with a weak reaction on the basal lamina in 5 cases and with no reaction in 2 cases. No positive findings were obtained beneath the melanocytes or on the basal lamina under the melanocytes. The discrepancy between the antigenic sites and the localization of immune deposits in BP is assumed to be due to the renewal of the hemidesmosomes and constant clearance of immune deposits in vivo. The in vivo bound immunoglobulins and complement seen in the BP skin are the result of their accumulation in the lamina lucida or in association with the basal lamina.\r"

  ".W": "Dermal papillae are small mesenchymally derived zones at the bases of hair follicles which have an important role in hair morphogenesis in the embryo and control of the hair growth cycle in postnatal mammals. The cells of the papilla are enmeshed in a dense extracellular matrix which undergoes extensive changes in concert with the hair cycle. Here it is shown that this matrix in anagen pelage follicles of postnatal rats contains an abundance of basement membrane components rather than dermal components such as interstitial collagens. In particular, type IV collagen, laminin, and basement membrane types of chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate proteoglycans are present as matrix components. Dermal papilla cells, when initially isolated from adult rat vibrissae and cultured in vitro, retained the potential to synthesize this spectrum of matrix components, but this was gradually lost, to be replaced by synthesis of other components including type I and III collagens. It seems likely therefore that the dermal papilla cells in vivo synthesize a basement membrane type of extracellular matrix, although a contribution from epithelial, and in some cases capillary endothelial, cells cannot be ruled out.\r"

After the action of Triton X-100, epidermal cells were stained in suspensions with KL1 antibody, and KL1-positive cells were separated by flow cytometry from KL1-negative cells (basal cells). This makes it possible to sort and analyze pure fractions of human epidermal basal cells since no less than 99% of the KL1 sorted cells were bearing bullous pemphigoid antigen. Therefore, the use of specific antibodies to cytoplasmic antigens can be of help in sorting pure fractions of cells of a particular tissue for further studies.\r"

The opsonic inhibitor from A. fumigatus was found to decrease binding of complement component C3b to fungal surfaces by selectively interfering with activation of the alternative complement pathway. Inhibition of complement did not appear to result simply from proteolysis, as judged by the minimal degradation of casein and of purified C3 and C4. The complement-inhibiting activity was partially labile to heating at 100 C and could be concentrated by using dialysis tubing with a 10,000-dalton exclusion limit. Aspergillus flavus, which is also a pathogen for humans, also produced this activity; A. niger did not. We speculate that this material may represent a pathogenesis factor for Aspergillus species.\r"

Aerosolized E. coli caused a brisk PMNL response in the lungs that was associated with a major increase in the levels of lactoferrin. Challenge with S. aureus was associated with a moderate increase in the number of macrophages and a moderate decrease in the levels of transferrin and iron but no change in the levels of lactoferrin.

The results obtained showed that 60-80% of the follicular fluids within the same range of steroid hormone levels contained virus p30 rp. Electron microscopy showed 80-nm virus-like particles, more or less well preserved, in about half of the number of oocytes examined. Negative staining of purified follicular fluid particles showed ring-like structures with a size of 100-200 mm. It is concluded that the presence of virus p30 rp in follicular fluids is correlated neither to a certain steroid hormone concentration nor to the oocyte capability to become fertilized and cleave. The observed expression of an endogenous virus genome during oocyte maturation strengthens the hypothesis that this type of genome is active at early developmental stages.\r"

Bovine and human immunoglobulins of the IgG class were adsorbed by the oocytes and all stages of preimplantation embryos, while IgG of mouse or goat origin was not. In contrast, none of the serum albumins was adsorbed to the cell surfaces of mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos. From the differential binding of IgG of some, but not all, of the species that were tested, we concluded that these cell surface IgG \"receptors\" on mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos are likely to be heterophilic in nature. Similar observations were made irrespective of the strain of mice used to provide the oocytes and embryos. These observations raise the question of whether human oocytes and preimplantation embryos should also be assayed for their ability to adsorb animal serum proteins that are possible candidates as a substitute protein supplement for human serum in culture medium used in human in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer programs.\r"

HES at concentrations as low as 2.5 mg/ml shortened the lag phase of turbidity increase and caused increased fibrin fiber mass/length ratios in both purified fibrin and plasma systems. For purified fibrin gels clotted with thrombin the mass/length ratio increased in a linear fashion from 2.6 to 6.1 X 10(12) daltons/cm as HES increased from 0 to 15 mg/ml. Fiber mass/length ratios for purified fibrin gels clotted with reptilase increased from 1.1 to 6.4 X 10(12) daltons/cm over the same HES concentration range. The addition of 5 mmol/L calcium to either system produced additional increases in fiber size. In 1:10 dilutions of plasma, HES shortened the lag phase, enhanced the rate of turbidity increase, and increased the final gel turbidity. The fiber mass/length ratio for plasma gels clotted with thrombin increased from 0.3 to 1.7 X 10(12) daltons/cm as HES increased from 0 to 20 mg/ml. For plasma gels clotted with reptilase, the fiber mass/length ratio increased from 1.5 to 2.4 X 10(12) daltons/cm over the same HES concentration range. The effects of HES are comparable to those of dextran at concentrations less than 5 mg/ml and can be explained on the basis of HES-enhanced lateral association of fibrin fibers during polymerization.\r"

  ".W": "Aggregated C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase reactant, binds to and influences the functional activities of human mononuclear leukocytes. Our purpose was to examine the potential interactions between CRP and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). Binding of CRP to PMNL was examined by flow cytometry after cell incubation with fluorescein-labeled heat-aggregated CRP (Agg-CRP) or Agg-CRP and fluorescein-conjugated F(ab')2 anti-CRP antibodies. It was determined that, at an optimal dose of Agg-CRP (100 micrograms), approximately 36% of PMNL were fluorescence positive. This was in contrast to the 70% of monocytes and 8% of lymphocytes that expressed Agg-CRP binding sites. Although less than half of resting PMNL bound Agg-CRP, up to 93% of PMNL activated with 1.0 micrograms/ml of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) expressed binding sites for Agg-CRP. Exposure to PMA similarly enhanced the amount of Agg-CRP bound per PMNL as determined by mean channel fluorescence. To evaluate whether Agg-CRP binding to PMNL could induce or modify a biologic response, respiratory burst activity was assessed by measuring luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. Whereas Agg-CRP alone did not elicit a chemiluminescence response, Agg-CRP synergistically enhanced the chemiluminescence response induced by heat-aggregated IgG (Agg-IgG). Although this enhancing effect of Agg-CRP could be observed at both optimal and suboptimal concentrations of Agg-IgG, no enhancement of PMA or serum-opsonized zymosan-induced CL was detected. These data demonstrate that aggregated CRP binds to and selectively modulates the response of PMNL to Fc receptor-mediated activation.\r"

Using core references, which are kept current in partnership with public health agencies, family physicians are able to provide comprehensive immunization, medications, and patient education for all travel risks. Families are given medical record summaries and recommended sources of care at their destination. Eight weeks after their return patients are reassessed for newly acquired illness and helped to integrate the perspectives gained during the travel into the family's future dynamics. Taking advantage of growing travel medicine opportunities, family medicine educators should base the care of travelers and teaching of residents on defined competence priorities. Travelers' health provides a mutually rewarding model of shared care with public health consultants in the community medicine curriculum.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1936 and 1950, detailed abstracts were prepared on all patients admitted to The Phipps Psychiatric Clinic from its opening in 1913 through 1950. Of these abstracts, 74% contained follow-up reports. Except for four papers on schizophrenia and affective disorders published between 1939 and 1943, none of this material has ever been analyzed. The present paper, the first of a series, examines the 8172 first admissions from 1913 through 1940, the period of Adolf Meyer's tenure as Clinic Director. Based on discharge diagnoses, we have sorted the patients into eight diagnostic groups with the following frequencies; schizophrenia, 17%; paranoid state, 3%; manic-depressive, 7%; depression, 27%; organic, 20%; neuroses, 15%; substance abuse, 6%; psychopath, 5%. Our manic-depressive group contains cases discharged primarily as hyperthymergasia, mania, or manic depressive insanity (MDI). Of the 349 cases diagnosed MDI at discharge, 10 had neither a history of nor present symptoms of mania, and these were put in the depression group. Frequencies for most of the diagnoses remained remarkably stable over the 28-year period. Only 9% were discharged recovered, whereas 43% were rated unimproved. Mean length of hospitalization was 76 days, with 10% of the patients readmitted. The mean length of follow-up was 9 years. Correlations of diagnoses, year of admission, length of stay, condition at discharge, age, sex, readmissions, change of diagnoses, somatic treatment, length of follow-up, and deaths in the clinic are presented. Meyer's influence on diagnostic practice is discussed.\r"

Shortly after Bunsen and Kirchhoff invented the spectrometer in 1860, the oxygen transport function of hemoglobin was demonstrated by Stokes and Hoppe-Seyler, who showed color changes produced by aeration of hemoglobin solutions. In 1932 in Gottingen, Germany, Nicolai optically recorded the in vivo oxygen consumption of a hand after circulatory occlusion. Kramer showed that the Lambert-Beer law applied to hemoglobin solutions and approximately to whole blood, and measured saturation by the transmission of red light through unopened arteries. Matthes in Leipzig, Germany, built the first apparatus to measure ear oxygen saturation and introduced a second wavelength (green or infrared) insensitive to saturation to compensate for blood volume and tissue pigments. Millikan built a light-weight ear \"oximeter\" during World War II to train pilots for military aviation. Wood added a pneumatic cuff to obtain a bloodless zero. Brinkman and Zijlstra in Groningen, The Netherlands, showed that red light reflected from the forehead could be used to measure oxygen saturation. Zijlstra initiated cuvette and catheter reflection oximetry. Instrumentation Laboratory used multiple wavelengths to measure blood carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin is cuvette oximeters. Shaw devised an eight-wavelength ear oximeter. Nakajima and co-workers invented the pulse oximeter, which avoids the need for calibration with only two wavelengths by responding only to the pulsatile changes in transmitted red and infrared light. Lubbers developed catheter tip and cuvette fiberoptic sensors for oxygen tension, carbon dioxide tension, and pH.\r"

  ".U": "87059952\r", 
  ".W": "The Medical Research Council UKALL V trial for children with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (aged 1 to 14 years, leucocyte count less than 20 X 10(9)/L) was designed to determine whether the immunosuppressive effects of treatment could be reduced without sacrifice of antileukemic effect by alterations in the type of continuing therapy or in fractionation of cranial irradiation. Remission was achieved in 496 children on standard induction therapy, and 309 children received 24 Gy of cranial irradiation in ten to 16 fractions over 21 days, and 174 received 21 Gy in five to nine fractions over 21 days. The type of radiotherapy administered had no influence on relapse at any site or rate of death in remission. All 496 children were randomized to receive chemotherapy for 2 or 3 years with 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate either as a continuous (group C) or a semicontinuous (group G) regimen or as a five-day pulse every 3 weeks (group I). All groups also received vincristine and prednisolone every 6 weeks. With a minimum follow-up of almost 7 years, patients in group I had significantly fewer remission deaths (P = .025) but a much higher rate of bone marrow relapse than those in group C or G (P = .002). There was an overall benefit for 3 years of chemotherapy compared with 2 years, which in contrast to previous studies, was more apparent in girls and in patients in groups C and G. Testicular relapse occurred in 37 boys, including 19 patients off therapy, with a previously negative biopsy. The overall results confirmed the prognostic significance of initial leucocyte count, even among these standard-risk patients, while girls had a superior rate of disease-free survival, but not of hematologic remission. It is concluded that, even among standard-risk patients, the prognosis is influenced by the height of the initial leukocyte count. While alterations in the fractionation of cranial irradiation do not appear to have influenced disease-free survival, intermittent continuing chemotherapy, although less immunosuppressive, is less effective than conventional continuous therapy in the treatment of ALL. In this study, 3 years of chemotherapy appeared superior to 2 years.\r"

Eight had primarily resistant disease, ten were in second progressive relapse, and two in third progressive relapse. One patient was not evaluable for response. Among the 19 evaluable patients the responses observed were complete response (CR), seven; partial response (PR), three; objective effect, five; and failure, four. However, survival was poor: 15 patients died, two are alive with disease, and three are alive with no evidence of disease (NED) at 8+, 11+, 14+ months post-BMT. Toxicity was high but considered as acceptable, taking into account the terminal state of these patients. Seven treatment-related deaths were observed. This combination therapy proved to be highly effective, with a response rate of 50%, and its value for eradication of residual disease in less advanced patients should be investigated.\r"

We tested doses of BCNU associated with reversible bone marrow toxicity and acceptable extramedullary toxicity without the use of ABMT in 19 patients with a diagnosis of advanced malignant melanoma. All patients were evaluable for toxicity and 18 were evaluable for response; one patient had a new primary tumor. The patient population had a median age of 44 years (range, 16 to 71) and a median Karnofsky performance status of 80 (range, 50 to 100). Ten were women and nine were men, all had visceral dominant disease, and none had received previous chemotherapy. Our purpose was to test the feasibility of treatment without ABMT, its toxicity and efficacy, and the possibility of administering sequential repeated courses of therapy. Vincristine was added to the regimen to potentially increase efficacy. Treatment consisted of BCNU (750 mg/m2) and vincristine (2 mg days 1 and 8). Six patients who recovered bone marrow function received melphalan (60 mg/m2) and vincristine (2 mg days 1 and 8). Twenty-two percent (95% confidence limits, 3% to 39%) of patients had remissions (all partial) and these were of short duration. Toxicity was substantial with 16% early lethality and 29% incidence of lethal drug-related complications. Two patients (11%) died toxic after a second course of BCNU. Our results suggest that there is no practical role for high-dose BCNU in the treatment of melanoma.\r"

  ".U": "87059966\r", 
  ".W": "We reviewed 53 publications reporting 751 patients with hematologic malignancies treated with low doses (5 to 20 mg/m2/d) of cytosine arabinoside (LoDAC). Of 507 patients evaluable for response, complete remission (CR) rates varied from 32% for patients with primary acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (1 degree ANLL) to 16% for patients with hematologic malignancies secondary to previous chemotherapy or following a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (2 degrees ANLL), and 16% for MDS. Median duration of CR was 9.5 months for 1 degree ANLL, and 10.5 months for both 2 degrees ANLL and MDS. Based on limited available survival data, overall median survival for these groups was 9 months, 3 months, and 15 months, respectively. Only three CRs were reported of 31 evaluable patients treated for a variety of other hematologic malignancies. CR rates for patients with 1 degree ANLL greater than or equal to 50 years old was 56%, compared with 29% less than 50 years old (P = .10). While prior chemotherapy was more common in 1 degree ANLL patients less than 50 years of age (86% v 21%; P less than .001), it did not influence response rates in those greater than 50 years of age, suggesting other biases. Hematologic toxicity was mentioned in only 33 of 53 publications, affecting 254 of 289 patients (88%), with at least 15% treatment-related deaths. LoDAC hypothetically acts as a differentiating agent; however, correlative laboratory studies were rarely performed. Cytogenetic data were available for only 15%, and in vitro studies for 10% of all patients with marked discrepancies in the interpretation of results. LoDAC is clearly cytotoxic for both malignant and normal hematopoietic cells. While large numbers of patients have been reported, the lack of well-designed clinical trials prohibits definitive conclusions as to its role as a differentiating agent. Future LoDAC studies should determine optimal dose and schedule, with clinical laboratory correlates to assess differentiation. Trials in ANLL comparing LoDAC with conventional chemotherapy, and in MDS with supportive care alone, may help identify the role of LoDAC. Until appropriate indications can be identified, LoDAC should not be routinely used in clinical practice.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-four consecutive patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy procedures were examined with intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IV-DSA) and duplex ultrasonography (DUS) at intervals ranging from 1 to 14 months postoperatively. Ninety-one percent of the DUS and 74% of the DSA images were of diagnostic quality. The two modalities agreed in the assessment of the endarterectomy appearance in 84% of the arteries, with 85% showing no evidence of significant residual disease. There were no arteries with severe restenosis or complete occlusion. In the 10 vessels in which the two modalities disagreed in disease assessment, the IV-DSA images were often degraded by artifact or vessel overlap leading to underestimation of disease. The authors conclude that DUS is the examination of choice for routine follow-up studies of carotid endarterectomy.\r"

A second growth curve began in 1976 at which time there were four PET centers in the United States, a number that grew to 60 worldwide over the next decade. PET, SPECT, MRI, and MRS are leading us into a new era of in vivo brain chemistry, based on regional bioenergetics and neurotransmission. The immediate impact is in epilepsy, stroke, brain tumors and the dementias, with psychiatric diseases becoming a major focus of research. Receptivity has become a biochemical as well as a psychological approach to mental functions. The finding of elevated D2 dopamine receptors in schizophrenia in living patients may be the forerunner of a new biochemical approach to psychiatry.\r"

Head and neck manifestations include cervical lymphadenopathy and Kaposi's sarcoma. Oral manifestations include Kaposi's sarcoma, candidiasis, hairy leukoplakia, precocious periodontal disease, xerostomia, herpes simplex, recurrent aphthae, erythema multiforme, and venereal warts. Although HTLV-III is present in saliva, there are no reported cases of transmission secondary to dental procedures. Appropriate precautions and techniques are recommended in treating patients at risk for AIDS.\r"

To determine the relationship between improvement in mechanics and improvement in gas exchange, the short- and long-term effects of furosemide therapy were studied in 16 spontaneously breathing infants with severe BPD who were both oxygen dependent and hypercarbic (mean PCO2 54 +/- 11 torr). Each infant was examined at least three times: before furosemide therapy, 1 hour after the first dose of furosemide, and after a 6- to 10-day course. Ten of the 16 infants were also examined three times during a 7-day control period. Transcutaneous PO2 and PCO2, esophageal pressure, air flow, and tidal volume were measured. Pulmonary resistance, lung compliance, and the alveolar to skin PO2 difference were calculated. After a single dose of furosemide, only compliance significantly improved. After prolonged therapy, compliance, resistance, and oxygenation significantly improved in the group as a whole, but better oxygenation was achieved in only six of 16 infants. tcPCO2 was unaffected by long-term furosemide therapy, but in all infants with decreased tcPCO2 1 hour after a single dose, there was sustained decrease in PCO2 after prolonged therapy. Changes in gas exchange were not explained by changes in lung mechanics. These data indicate that long-term diuretic therapy can improve the mechanical properties of the lungs of spontaneously breathing infants with BPD, but that gas exchange is usually unaffected.\r"

Furthermore, there are no firm statistical data concerning the incidence of pertussis vaccine-related encephalopathy. Rather, the literature on pertussis vaccine complications is replete with anecdotal reports and retrospective studies with a number of questionable conclusions drawn from this inadequate data base. Unfortunately, these conclusions have been sensationalized and exploited with litigious fervor to the point that the practice of pertussis immunization is being questioned in the United States. A number of points should be reiterated: pertussis is a dangerous and deadly disease, as seen in the epidemic in Great Britain; pertussis immunization is effective in protecting against the disease; and there is no conclusive proof that the incidence of complications from pertussis vaccination of children with seizure disorders or other preexisting stable neurologic abnormalities is higher, because appropriate studies have not been done to define such a risk. We would do well to keep these facts in mind in order to avoid a disaster similar to the pertussis epidemic in Great Britain. Pertussis vaccination should be given to all children except those with allergic hypersensitivity, a progressive neurologic disorder, or an adverse reaction to a previous pertussis dose.\r"

Vaccination began in early fall 1984, and continued through spring 1985. Forty-nine infants received one dose of vaccine or placebo; 43 received both doses of vaccine or placebo. At 2 and 3 months after vaccination, homologous geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers were significantly higher in children who received either dose of vaccine compared with placebo recipients. Cumulative seroconversion to bovine rotavirus after either dose of vaccine virus was 87% at 6 months of age. Seroconversion was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in both vaccine groups compared with the placebo group. No ill effects were associated with vaccine administration. RIT 4237 vaccine appears to be safe and immunogenic when administered to young infants living in the United States.\r"

Baseline growth rates averaged 4.3 cm/yr, and all were within 2 SD of mean growth velocity for age in girls with Turner syndrome. Sixty-seven girls remained in the study for a minimum of 1 year. Growth rates and growth velocity (in standard deviations for age in girls with Turner syndrome) were control 3.8 cm/yr (-0.1 SD), hGH 6.6 cm/yr (+2.3 SD), oxandrolone 7.9 cm/yr (+3.7 SD), and combination therapy 9.8 cm/yr (+5.4 SD). Mean bone ages advanced 1.0 years (hGH), 1.3 years (oxandrolone), and 1.6 years (combination). However, median increments in height age/bone age (delta HA/delta BA) ratios ranged from 1.0 to 1.1 for treatment groups, compared with 0.8 for the controls. Predicted adult height by the method of Bayley-Pinneau increased 2.5 cm for hGH or oxandrolone alone, and 3.2 cm for combination treatment. These data indicate that both hGH and oxandrolone can significantly stimulate short-term skeletal growth in patients with Turner syndrome, and potentially increase final adult height.\r"

Growth hormone treatment (0.2 IU/kg three times per week) resulted in enhancement of the growth rate to 5.9 +/- 1.4 cm/yr for the first year of therapy. The bone age advanced approximately 1 year during the year of therapy. The growth hormone therapy was discontinued at 12 months, and the mean growth rate decreased to pretreatment levels, 3.1 +/- 1.9 cm/yr; 26 of 41 patients actually had post-treatment growth rates that were less than the pretreatment rate. Glucose tolerance tests at 6-month intervals did not indicate an effect of hGH treatment on glucose intolerance. Several patients had glucose intolerance that preceded hGH treatment, but this remained stable during treatment; glucose intolerance likely was related to obesity in this group of patients. Basal and hGH-stimulated somatomedin C levels (32 patients) correlated with age of the patient but not with growth rate during therapy. We conclude that hGH therapy can accelerate the growth rate of patients with Turner syndrome. The growth rate increased to \"normal\" levels and was dependent on continued treatment with hGH. If the response continues, long-term treatment of Turner syndrome may result in increased adult height.\r"

We assessed growth by measurement of the 4-week lower leg growth rate and by height velocity. Bone age was determined at the beginning and end of treatment. Growth rate during ethinyl estradiol treatment was approximately 70% greater than during placebo (P less than 0.001), without any bone age advancement relative to that with placebo. The change in predicted height was significantly greater after 6 months treatment with ethinyl estradiol than after treatment with placebo (mean +/- SEM, +0.35 +/- 0.38 cm vs. -0.85 +/- 0.32 cm, P less than 0.03). Breast budding occurred in six patients. We conclude that it may be feasible to begin low-dose estrogen therapy to promote growth at an earlier age than would be conventionally used to induce pubertal development. These data are still relatively short term, however; until long-term data are available, it would be premature to make definitive recommendations regarding the dose and timing of estrogen treatment in Turner syndrome.\r"

Baseline serum progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycortisol, and cortisol levels were normal and adequately responsive to ACTH stimulation. No steroid was found abnormally elevated. A diagnosis of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency was established on the basis of elevated urinary tetrahydrocortisol plus allotetrahydrocortisol/tetrahydrocortisone ratio, determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Evaluation of bone mineral metabolism and parathyroid function, and skeletal radiographs, revealed the presence of rickets and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Treatment with spironolactone alone for 2 months corrected hypertension, hypokalemic alkalosis, and all laboratory and radiologic evidence of rickets and hyperparathyroidism, resulting in acceleration of growth rate. The response to spironolactone suggests that a hypermineralocorticoid state is responsible for the hypertensive syndrome and that rickets and hyperparathyroidism could be a consequence of excess mineralocorticoid activity.\r"

After being grafted with cultured allogeneic epidermal cells, superficial wounds, e.g., donor sites, healed within 7 days, compared to 14 days for mirror image control sites. Deep second-degree burn wounds which were excised before grafting with cultured cells healed in a mean time of 10 days. Deep second-degree burn wounds which were not excised before grafting healed in a mean time of 14 days. The cultured cells produced rapid healing in 11 of the 12 patients with deep second-degree burn wounds. The deep second-degree wounds grafted with cultured allogeneic epidermal cells healed with results which were comparable to the deep second-degree wounds which were autografted. Grafts of cultured allogeneic epidermal cells placed on full-thickness, or third-degree burn, wounds did not grow well.\r"

  ".W": "The improved patency rates that have been claimed for in situ femoropopliteal vein bypass have been attributed to improved hemodynamics because of the natural taper of the vein and maintenance of wall compliance because of preservation of the nutrient vasa vasorum. Blood flow in 31 in situ and 21 reversed vein grafts was measured noninvasively with a duplex ultrasound scanner at a median of 6 months after operation. There was no significant difference in the resting or hyperemic flows between the two groups (p much greater than 0.1). The compliance of 15 undisturbed and 15 fully mobilized in situ vein grafts was measured noninvasively by Doppler ultrasonography immediately after operation and at 3 months. There was a significant fall in compliance in both groups (p less than 0.001) but no significant difference between them (p much greater than 0.1). We have been unable to demonstrate any significant hemodynamic advantage with the in situ technique but believe that its use is still justified because of technically easier anastomoses and an improved utilization rate. Preservation of the vasa vasorum does not maintain wall compliance and complete mobilization of the vein relieves any uneven tension and ensures that all venous tributaries are ligated, removing the risk of arteriovenous fistulas.\r"

This study compares Doppler frequency analyses in 22 patients with reversed veins and in 21 patients with in situ femoropopliteal vein grafts. Signals from the common femoral artery, the femoral anastomosis, and the vein in the mid thigh were analyzed and the pulsatility index (PI) and flow disturbance index (FDI) calculated (FDI = maximum frequency divided by median frequency). The two groups were similar clinically and common femoral artery PI showed inflow to be similar and satisfactory. Marked turbulence occurred at the femoral anastomosis where peak FDI rose from 1.67 +/- 0.19 (mean +/- SD) to 2.96 +/- 0.69 in the in situ vein group and from 1.74 +/- 0.51 to 3.11 +/- 0.64 in the reversed vein group (p less than 0.001). This turbulence was much reduced at mid thigh level where peak FDI had fallen to 1.45 +/- 0.17 in the reversed vein group and 1.51 +/- 0.23 in the in situ vein group (p less than 0.001). Comparison of the signals from the femoral anastomosis and from the vein at mid thigh showed that the amount of flow disturbance was no different in the in situ vein group from that in the reversed vein group (unpaired t test). In this study flow patterns were not improved by use of the in situ bypass technique.\r"

The proposal would replace the present Medicare program with a system of vouchers to older persons to purchase private health insurance policies or plans providing specified adequate benefits including catastrophic coverage. Vouchers would be financed by a new tax on adjusted gross income during working years that would replace the present employee health insurance payroll tax, and by continuation of the employer health insurance payroll tax. Tax rates would be at a level sufficient both to meet obligations to current Medicare beneficiaries and, over a 30-year period, to achieve prefunding of benefits. All tax contributions after that date would be preserved for the future use of those taxed, and could be invested during earning years, rather than being paid out immediately for present beneficiaries. The proposal would place health care for the elderly on a fiscally sound basis, provide increased cost sharing for those who are financially well off, and provide the protection against catastrophic health care expense lacking under the current Medicare program.\r"

One such agent, lovastatin (formerly, mevinolin), causes significant reductions in plasma cholesterol levels. This action can be enhanced by bile acid sequestrants. In this study, lovastatin and colestipol hydrochloride together were administered to ten patients with primary moderate hypercholesterolemia. Compared with a control period, the combined-drug therapy caused a 36% reduction in plasma total cholesterol level, a 48% decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, and a 17% increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. The reduction in LDL cholesterol level was due to three factors: a 27% decrease in the production rate of LDL, a 20% increase in fractional catabolic rate of LDL, and a 15% depletion of cholesterol in LDL particles. This major reduction in LDL cholesterol level produced by combined-drug therapy may be valuable for prevention of coronary heart disease in high-risk patients with primary moderate hypercholesterolemia.\r"

Renin concentration was measured in systemic arterial plasma (A-PRC) and in either early proximal tubular fluid (TFR), or in plasma from the welling point of the efferent arteriole (SV-PRC) belonging to the microperfused nephron. Micropuncture collections were controlled to maintain the proximal intratubular pressure equal to the control free-flow pressure. Increasing the Henle loop flow rate from 12 to 18, or to 34 nl/min, was followed by a significant decrease in TFR, while reducing the flow rate from 12 to 6 nl/min caused a significant increase in TFR. Similarly, increasing the Henle loop free-flow rate by 6 to 8 nl/min depressed SV-PRC, while reducing the flow rate by fluid aspiration at 8 to 10 nl/min caused a significant increase in SV-PRC. These data indicate: that renin release, to a significant part at least, occurs into the vascular lumen of the afferent arteriole: that modest changes in early distal flow rate may control renin release from the JG-cells; and that increasing the flow rate depresses renin release, and vice versa. It is suggested that the renin system is directly involved in an additional TGF mechanism controlling postglomerular vascular resistances.\r"

  ".W": "Removal of insulin from the peritubular vessels involves binding of insulin to specific receptors in the basolateral membranes (BLM); this is followed by phosphorylation of the receptor which may mediate the actions of the hormone. In most tissues receptor number is regulated by plasma insulin levels and is increased in insulinopenic diabetics. To determine whether cortical BLM insulin receptors are similarly regulated, we studied insulin binding to receptors in BLM from normal control rats and rats with streptozotocin diabetes of varying severity. Specific binding of insulin did not differ between control and modestly insulinopenic diabetics but was increased significantly in the severely insulinopenic diabetics. Insulin treatment returned binding to normal. Scatchard analysis suggested an increase in the binding capacity of the severe diabetic BLM rather than an increase in affinity for insulin. This latter was confirmed by competitive experiments in which similar displacement curves were obtained with control and diabetic membranes. Insulin removed by glomerular filtration binds to specific receptors in the luminal membranes but unlike BLM receptors, phosphorylation of these luminal receptors has not been observed. To determine whether luminal and BLM receptors differ structurally, binding sites in both membranes were affinity labelled with 125I-insulin and the cross linking agent, disuccinimidyl suberate, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of a reducing agent. Autoradiograms revealed that the major specifically labelled subunit in both membranes is a 135,000 Mr species which is more abundant in the BLM. We conclude that insulin receptors in cortical BLM respond to severe insulinopenic diabetes as do receptors in most other tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cysts lining epithelia of superficial and deep cysts were microdissected and compared to individual normal human proximal straight tubules (PST) and cortical collecting tubules (CCT) grown in defined media. PKD cyst epithelia differed from normal renal tubular epithelia in growth patterns and structural and functional properties. PKD epithelia grew more rapidly and showed cyst-like areas in otherwise confluent monolayers. Polygonal and elongate cells contained an epithelial-specific cytokeratin antigen and had polarized morphology. An extremely abnormal basement membrane morphology was seen and consisted of some banded collagen and numerous unique blebs or spheroids. These blebs were apparently extruded from intracellular vacuoles and stained with ruthenium red, suggesting a proteoglycan component. Cytochemistry of marker enzymes demonstrated the presence of NaK-ATPase and alkaline phosphatase, but a lack of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. The response of adenylate cyclase activity to vasopressin, parathyroid hormone, and forskolin was significantly diminished in PKD cells as compared to PST and CCT. These studies suggest a defect in cell growth and basement membrane synthesis in human PKD. Cultured PKD epithelia provide a new tool for the study of the pathogenesis of this disease.\r"

While this new syndrome has been receiving increasing attention, its etiology has not been clarified. We have isolated amyloid fibrils from amyloid laden tissues inside the carpal tunnel in four different hemodialysis patients with CTS. After solubilization in guanidine HCl, a significant amount of the protein was located in a homogeneous, low molecular weight fraction. Each protein was found to be identical to beta 2-microglobulin with regard to its molecular weight of 11,000 on SDS-PAGE, amino acid composition and N-terminal amino acids: Ile-Gln-Arg-Thr-Pro-Lys-Ile-Gln-Val-Tyr-Ser-Arg-His-Pro-Ala-Glu. In direct immunofluorescent study, anti-beta 2-microglobulin did react positively with amyloid deposits. These results demonstrate that the amyloid associated with chronic hemodialysis contains as major component a new form of amyloid fibril protein that is homologous to beta 2-microglobulin. It is postulated that beta 2-microglobulin cannot be removed from the blood by conventional hemodialysis, and accumulates in tissues causing the formation of amyloid fibrils, which, having a relatively high affinity to the carpal tunnel area, thus causes CTS.\r"

In morphologically normal kidneys, C5b-9 neoantigens were observed within all connective matrices (arteriolar media, glomerular basement membrane (GBM), mesangial matrix and tubular basement membrane). The C3d and C3g antigens of the C3dg, and C3bi cleavage fragments of C3 and Factor H antigens were found in similar locations. None of the matrices stained for immunoglobulins. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that C3d, C3g, H antigens and the C5b-9 neoantigens were localized on membranous and vesicular structures embedded in the connective matrices. These structures represent cell membranes shed from adjacent cells as evidenced by their ultrastructural appearance and by the fact that those which were in close vicinity to pedicles within the GBM expressed the C3b receptor antigen, a specific marker for podocyte membranes. Formation of C5b-9 complexes in the shielded environment of connective matrices may explain their persistence over long periods of time in the absence of apparent immunopathological consequences. Biopsies from pathological kidneys were classified into three groups based on the pattern of glomerular staining with anti-C5b-9 antibodies. In the first group, a sparse mesangial labeling was seen, similar to that observed in normal kidneys. In the second group, abundant clusters of C5b-9 were seen in the same location as immune deposits. Activation of the complement system to completion could be documented in the absence of detectable C3 (C3c) antigen in glomeruli. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that C5b-9 neoantigens were present on cell remnants in connective matrices in all specimens that were studied. Labeled cell remnants were present in large amounts in sclerotic matrices. C5b-9 neoantigens were constantly found on old and large immune deposits, and absent or occasionally present on recent and small immune deposits. In membranous nephropathy stage I, proteinuria appeared to be independent of the presence or absence of detectable C5b-9 neoantigens on immune deposits. Thus, the presence of C5b-9 neoantigens in pathological renal tissue does not have an univocal significance, and requires analysis of the localization of the antigens and appropriate controls in order to assess the potential role of C5b-9 in tissue damage.\r"

The cross-sectional area of all three fiber types was reduced in renal transplant patients treated with prednisone (10.6 +/- 4.3 mg/day), the fast glycolytic fibers being most affected (slow oxidative fibers: 2642 +/- 625 vs. 3677 +/- 970 micron2, P less than 0.001; fast oxidative fibers: 3275 +/- 735 vs. 4443 +/- 1343 micron2, P less than 0.01; fast glycolytic fibers: 2305 +/- 802 vs. 3920 +/- 1522 micron2, P less than 0.001). This was mostly due to a decrease in the volume of myofibrils per unit volume of muscle fiber (-30%). The intracellular lipid content and the volume density of subsarcolemmal mitochondria were increased by more than 70% in prednisone treated patients. In conclusion, the decreased myofibril areas might account for the muscle weakness in renal transplant patients treated with prednisone, and the decrease in myofibrils is in part functionally compensated by an increase in subsarcolemmal mitochondria and intracellular lipid content.\r"

  ".U": "87062038\r", 
  ".W": "In summary, many lines of evidence indicate that the sympathetic nervous system, via the renal nerves, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renovascular hypertension in humans and laboratory animals. Patients with established renovascular hypertension have increased sympathetic nervous system activity, as evidenced by increased plasma and urinary norepinephrine levels, elevated excretion of catecholamine metabolites, and an exaggerated depressor response to centrally acting sympatholytic agents. The observation that converting enzyme inhibitors can cause both blood pressure and urinary norepinephrine excretion to return to normal in patients with renovascular hypertension is consistent with the interpretation that activation of the sympathetic nervous system in these subjects is, at least in part, angiotensin-induced. The sympathetic nervous system, via the efferent renal nerves, plays a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension in a number of experimental models. In the spontaneously hypertensive rat of the Okamoto strain (SHR) and in the DOCA/NaCl hypertensive model, increased renal efferent nerve activity contributes to the development of hypertension by causing increased renal sodium retention. In both of these experimental models, renal denervation delays the development and blunts the severity of hypertension. This delay is associated with increased urinary sodium excretion, suggesting a renal efferent mechanism. In contrast to the predominantly efferent renal nerve mechanisms observed in the DOCA-NaCl and SHR models, studies of the effects of renal denervation in one-kidney, one-clip and two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats suggest that renal afferent nerves are important in these models of hypertension. Total renal denervation in rats with established 1K, 1C and 2K, 1C hypertension attenuates the severity of the hypertension without altering sodium intake or excretion, renin activity, water intake, or renal function. Thus, efferent renal nerve activity does not appear to be involved in the development of maintenance of 1K, 1C or 2K, 1C hypertension. In contrast with the findings in SHR and DOCA-NaCl rats, these studies provide indirect evidence that the renal afferent nerves play a role in the pathogenesis of this form of experimental hypertension. The major effect of renal denervation in these models appears to be an interruption of renal afferent nerve activity, which by a direct feedback mechanism attenuates systemic sympathetic tone, thereby lowering blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

While ampicillin, cephalothin and trimethoprim were undetectable in the medulla within six hours of cessation of therapy, gentamicin was still detectable in levels six folds above the MIC up to six months after treatment had ceased. Six months after the end of treatment, the percentage of sterile left kidneys in animals treated with ampicillin (50%), cephalothin (15%), trimethoprim (20%) was lower than the percentage of animals receiving 14 days of gentamicin (100%), or the combinations AG:89%, CG:67% and TG:60%, P less than 0.01. Following three days of gentamicin, 50% of the left kidneys were sterilized. When compared to ampicillin, cephalothin or trimethoprim alone, combined therapies significantly reduced the number of CFU in the kidneys P less than 0.01. These combinations were almost as effective as two weeks of therapy with gentamicin. Short-term therapy (three days) with an aminoglycoside which concentrates in the renal parenchyma, combined with an antibiotic which will accumulate in other parts of the nephron, may result in \"pharmacological synergy\". This new approach to therapy of pyelonephritis may be promising.\r"

The majority of interstitial leukocytes were T cells (mean 65.7 +/- 14.1). The number of cells reactive with OKT8 (47.3 +/- 11.0) exceeded the number of OKT4 positive cells (32.5 +/- 11.3) in 22 of 26 biopsies. Cells reactive with antimonocyte antibodies OKM1 and OKM5 (6.7 +/- 5.9 and 7.9 +/- 5.9, respectively) and B lymphocytes (OKB2 3.9 +/- 3.5) were a minor component of the interstitial infiltrates. Monocytes were the predominant cell type among stained cells in glomerular tufts and crescents. Tissue T4/T8 ratios varied widely (range 0.31 to 1.81), and were less than 1 in 22 of 26 patients. There was no correlation between tissue T4/T8 ratios and simultaneous peripheral blood T4/T8 ratios. Using stepwise multivariate linear regression, tissue T4/T8 ratio was found to correlate highly with renal histologic activity (P less than 0.001) but was not independently predictive of any other histopathologic or clinical variable studied. Mean tissue T4/T8 ratio in LN was significantly lower than that of other glomerular and interstitial diseases studied (P less than 0.001), a finding which may reflect differences in the pathogenesis of renal injury. These findings suggest that local cellular immune mechanisms may be important in the modulation of disease activity in LN.\r"

The mechanism by which maleic acid alters renal function is uncertain, though the tubular defect is known to be associated with decreased ATP levels. Because of this alteration in nucleotide metabolism the present study was undertaken to determine the role of elevated endogenous adenosine in mediating the maleic acid-induced changes in renal function. Since the renal effects of exogenous adenosine are enhanced by sodium-depletion and attenuated by sodium-loading, the present study compared the time course of the effects of maleic acid on renal function in 10 dogs maintained on a low sodium diet, and 10 dogs maintained on a high sodium diet. In addition, we examined the effect of maleic acid on adenosine levels in renal venous plasma, on the urinary excretion of adenosine, and the effect of the adenosine antagonist, theophylline, on the maleic acid-induced changes in renal function. After 100 min of maleic acid, GFR was decreased significantly by 55 +/- 4% of control in the sodium-depleted dogs, and by 39 +/- 4% of control in the sodium-loaded dogs. In the sodium-depleted dogs, renin release was also significantly depressed (12 +/- 8% of control) during the infusion of maleic acid. The fractional excretion of sodium was significantly increased in both groups. The renal venous concentration of adenosine and the urinary excretion of adenosine were both significantly increased during maleic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This injury manifests both as an increase in the rate of urinary protein excretion and altered renal hemodynamic characteristics. We have utilized an isolated perfused kidney system (IPK) to assess the capacity of antiGBM antibody to alter glomerular permselectivity in the absence of both glomerular complement activation and neutrophil infiltration. Control perfusions with Krebs-Henseleit buffered 5% albumin solutions containing normal sheep globulin had a protein excretion rate of 0.223 +/- 0.044 mg/min (mean +/- SEM). Assessment of glomerular permselectivity using fractional dextran clearances demonstrated an intact negative charge barrier in control preparations. AntiGBM antibody bound in a dose related fashion to the kidney and was localized to the glomerular basement membrane on immunofluorescence. Antibody induced a significant increase in mean protein excretion (2.009 +/- 0.681 mg/min, P less than 0.01) in association with a loss of the glomerular filter's negative charge barrier. These IPK studies demonstrate that antiGBM antibody can itself produce proteinuria, in association with loss of the glomerular capillary negative charge barrier, in the absence of all circulating humoral and cellular inflammatory mediator systems.\r"

In the current study, the functional role of these glomerular T-lymphocytes in directing macrophage localization was sought by measuring their production of macrophage migration inhibition factor (MIF). MIF activity in supernatants from cultured isolated glomeruli was measured in a conventional capillary tube bioassay. Glomerular T-lymphocytes (OX19 positive cells) were maximal (1.95 +/- 0.19 cells/glomerular cross section, c/gcs) 24 hours after injection of antiGBM antibody into sensitized animals. Seventy-two hours after antibody injection, T-lymphocyte numbers were reduced (1.02 +/- 0.14 c/gcs) while macrophage accumulation was maximal (at 24 hrs 4.2 +/- 1.3 macrophages/glomerulus (m/g), at 72 hrs 19.8 +/- 3.7 m/g). MIF activity was only detected in supernatants from T-lymphocyte infiltrated glomeruli (12 hrs 40.81 +/- 4.32% migration inhibition, 24 hrs 45.11 +/- 4.11% migration inhibition, 48 hrs 38.24 +/- 3.53% migration inhibition, 72 hrs 20.86 +/- 3.85% migration inhibition, all P less than 0.05). Control glomeruli from normal animals, pre-immunized animals given normal sheep globulin, pre-immunized animals given anti-GBM antibody and Cyclosporin A, and non-pre-immunized animals given antiGBM antibody did not contain glomerular T-lymphocytes, and their supernatants contained no MIF activity. This data indicates that the glomerular T-lymphocytes in pre-immunized antiGBM-GN are sensitized cells which release MIF and thus may direct glomerular macrophage localization in this model of antibody-induced glomerulonephritis.\r"

Renal transplantation was used to study 125I BSA uptake (single and paired label techniques) in normal and CSS kidneys exposed to the same immunologic milieu. In CSS, the daily dose of BSA (dose 15 to 150 mg) was substituted with radiolabeled BSA. Uptake in washed kidney homogenates (24 hours) in the recipient's native CSS kidney varied from 0.29 to 38.40 micrograms/g of kidney (mean 11.70) compared to 0.09 to 2.19 micrograms/g (mean 1.01) in the transplanted normal kidney. The ratio of uptake in the CSS/normal kidney varied from 2.1 to 17.5. These findings indicated that intrarenal factors were important in renal uptake since both kidneys had been exposed to the same circulating immune complex load. Transplantation between \"early\" (nonproteinuric) and late (proteinuric) CSS rabbits again suggested intrarenal factors influence the uptake of 125I BSA immune complex components with late CSS kidney/early CSS kidney uptake ratios of 25 and 49 in the pairs examined. When CSS kidneys were transplanted into normal rabbits, the binding of 1 to 160 mg of radiolabeled BSA in the transplanted CSS kidney varied from 0.68 to 22.89 micrograms/g (mean 7.15) compared to 0.01 to 0.84 microgram/g (mean 0.18) in the normal rabbit's native kidney.

In the rat, we have shown that reduced chloride transport in the loop is associated with increased renin release. Based on indirect evidence, it has been suggested that chlorpropamide (CPMD) increases loop solute transport. This study directly evaluates the effect of CPMD on loop chloride transport and plasma renin activity (PRA) in the male Sprague-Dawley rat. Loop of Henle chloride reabsorption (measured by recollection micropuncture) and PRA were determined before and after acute infusion of CPMD (N = 8) or vehicle (N = 8). Although delivery to the loop was not significantly changed, CPMD increased (P less than 0.05) absolute loop chloride reabsorption from 1798 pEq/min +/- 200 SE to 2453 pEq/min +/- 206 SE. PRA was decreased (P less than 0.01) from 9.2 ng/ml/hr +/- 1.0 SE to 5.6 ng/ml/hr +/- 0.8 SE following CPMD infusion. Comparable vehicle infusion did not alter loop chloride reabsorption or PRA. Arterial pressure, and whole kidney and single nephron glomerular filtration rates were unchanged following infusion of CPMD or vehicle. These results demonstrate that an increase in loop chloride reabsorption is associated with a decrease in renin release. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that renin release is inversely related to the magnitude of chloride transport in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.\r"

Although the renal functional abnormalities in the HRS suggest prerenal azotemia, volume expansion with saline, albumin or ascitic fluid rarely results in reversal of the HRS because fluid redistributes from the vascular space. Since the peritoneovenous (PV) shunt causes sustained central volume expansion, it has been advocated for the treatment of the HRS. We prospectively compared the PV shunt (N = 10) to Medical Therapy (MED) (N = 10) on renal function and mortality in 20 patients with the HRS associated with alcoholic liver disease. The HRS was diagnosed on the basis of clinical, hemodynamic, and laboratory criteria. The insertion of a PV shunt resulted in an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (4.2 +/- 1.1 vs. -1.5 +/- 1.0 mm Hg, P less than 0.01) and in cardiac index (0.8 +/- 0.3 vs. -0.2 +/- 0.3 1/min/m2, P less than 0.05). After 48 to 72 hours, weight (+3.1 +/- 1.1 kg) and serum creatinine (3.9 +/- 0.5 to 5.5 +/- 0.7 mg/dl, P less than 0.001) were increased with MED therapy and decreased (weight: -3.7 +/- 0.7 kg; serum creatinine: 3.6 +/- 0.4 to 3.0 +/- 0.5, P less than 0.05) with the PV shunt. Despite improvement in renal function, only one patient with the PV shunt had prolonged survival (210 days). In the remainder, survival was 13.8 +/- 2.2 days compared to 4.1 +/- 0.6 days with MED therapy. We conclude that the PV shunt often stabilizes renal function, but does not prolong life in patients with the HRS.\r"

To study the clinical characteristics of this newly described disease and assess the utility of available diagnostic methods, 130 patients with chronic renal failure (100 on dialysis, 30 nondialyzed) were studied with ultrasonography and/or computerized tomography (CT). Among patients on dialysis, 22% had acquired renal cystic disease (ARCD), an additional 30% had one to three solitary cysts, and 48% had no cysts. In nondialyzed patients, 7% had ARCD, 53% had one to three solitary cysts, and 40% had no cysts. Among these 130 chronic renal failure patients (nondialyzed and dialyzed), 21 of 86 males compared to 1 of 44 females had ARCD (P less than 0.001). Duration of dialysis therapy and age were greater in patients with ARCD (49.8 +/- 8 months, 55 +/- 4 years, respectively) compared to those with solitary cysts (28 +/- 6 months, 45 +/- 2 years) or no cysts (15 +/- 3 months, 42 +/- 2 years). The diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound (US) was compared to CT. CT is purportedly 100% accurate in the characterization of renal cysts. We are disappointed at the low level of diagnostic accuracy for both CT and US in the detection of renal cysts in chronic uremia. It appears both a negative CT and ultrasound are necessary to absolutely exclude either ARCD or solitary cyst.\r"

Review of available literature and clinical and experimental data supports the notion that \"reversion\" of malignant cells into phenotypically benign counterparts may take place spontaneously or under the influence of environmental factors. Anticancer agents (cytostatics, radiation) selectively destroy the more anaplastic cells present in a malignant tumor (or its metastatic implants), thus allowing the \"benign\" revertants to predominate. Although such lesions are benign-appearing, it is recommended that they be completely excised; however, but further chemo- or radiotherapy may not be necessary.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five of 49 patients who underwent a Fontan type operation had complex lesions other than tricuspid atresia with ventriculoarterial concordance. Three patients had significant subaortic stenosis. Thirty-four palliative operations, including nine Glenn shunts, were performed before the Fontan operation. Direct atriopulmonary anastomosis was performed in 21 patients. In four, valved conduits were used. Twelve patients had right atrioventricular valve patch closure (three had running and nine had interrupted suture technique). On the basis of the presence of increased or decreased pulmonary blood flow before any surgical intervention, patients were divided into Group 1 (previous pulmonary artery banding, N = 8) and Group II (pulmonic stenosis, N = 17). Postoperatively, in Group I, 87% had significant effusions, mean right atrial pressure was higher (20.6 +/- 6.5 torr), and hospital stay longer (31 days). In Group II, 40% had significant effusions, mean right atrial pressure was lower (16.5 +/- 4.3 torr), and hospital stay shorter (15 days). Significant atrioventricular valve patch disruption occurred in three patients (two had running suture technique), and conduit occlusion occurred in two. Four patients (three with subaortic stenosis and pulmonary artery banding) without an established Glenn shunt required Fontan takedown for persistent low cardiac output, two of whom died (2/25 or 8%). There were three late deaths (3/23 or 13%). Nineteen of 20 surviving patients observed from 2 months to 6 years are doing well. We believe that early Fontan takedown in patients with persistent low cardiac output, interrupted suture technique for atrioventricular valve closure, avoidance of valved conduits, and a preliminary Glenn shunt in patients with pulmonary artery banding and/or subaortic stenosis can further improve the results with the Fontan operation for complex lesions.\r"

  ".U": "87062637\r", 
  ".W": "Forty-one patients, distributed among four centers, had left (33 patients), right (five), or bilateral (three) temporary ventricular assistance with textured (24) or smooth (17) surfaced diaphragm pumps, during an evaluation supported by the National Institutes of Health. Cardiac failure had occurred in 39 postoperative patients (after aorta-coronary bypass [23], valve replacement [four], both [nine], or other [three]), with total cardiopulmonary bypass time mean 306 minutes (range 69 to 600). Two patients had cardiomyopathy. Death of 35 nonsurvivors was due to myocardial necrosis (14), hemorrhage (nine), cerebrovascular accidents (three), infection (three), and other (six). Mean duration of support in all patients was 62 hours. In 16 patients (40%) whose condition improved, cardiac assist duration was mean 127 hours (range 48 to 264), compared with mean 19 hours (range 1 to 120) in 25 who did not. Of 17 patients in whom duration of support exceeded 72 hours, 15 (88%) improved, 11 were weaned, and six survived long term. Tissue examination (in 33 patients) by biopsy at pump implantation or autopsy revealed coagulation or contraction band myocyte necrosis, with or without hemorrhage, in 26 patients; of these, 10 improved and six were long-term survivors. Pump-related complications (two) included pulmonary embolism, most likely related to a cannulation site thrombus, and an aortic cannulation site infection in one patient each. This study suggests that mechanical cardiac assist may be accomplished with a low complication rate; should not necessarily be denied to patients with existing necrosis, because myocardial necrosis does not preclude improvement or survival; and frequently leads to functional myocardial recovery if patients survive early noncardiac complications, often the result of long duration of cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

  ".W": "There is no question that Baron Larrey was the first modern military surgeon. The high morale of Napolean's troops, which contributed to the success of his armies, was in a major way dependent on Larrey's superb medical care of the wounded. It was Napoleon's brilliance to recognize this and to give Larrey free rein. Beginning in the Civil War, when ambulances first brought in the wounded to receive surgical care at the Battle of Antietam (1862), down to World War II and the Vietnam War, his principles were increasingly followed by the U.S. Army Medical Corps. In Vietnam a true \"flying ambulance,\" the medical helicopter, was obviously the final perfection of Larrey's ambulance volante. Perhaps his dedicated humanism in the care of the wounded soldier was his best characteristic and the one that should be followed most carefully today. Even in this era of great ethical concerns for the sick and wounded, Larrey's principles set the highest of standards for all.\r"

The intra-aortic balloon pump, the left and right ventricular assist pumps, and the pneumatic artificial heart represent the range of devices capable of keeping a patient alive who is awaiting a donor organ. The major difficulty in using circulatory support devices is infection, which is caused by their required percutaneous tubes. We report here our experiences with mechanical circulatory support devices as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. In a series of 31 consecutive transplant procedures, six patients have required preoperative mechanical circulatory support. The intra-aortic balloon pump was used in two patients for 2 and 14 days, respectively, before transplantation. Both patients are well 10 and 11 months after the transplant procedure. Two patients required the left ventricular assist device for 11 and 21 days and are alive 3 weeks and 8 months, respectively, after transplantation. One patient was supported by the pneumatic artificial heart for 10 days before a donor heart became available but died of septic shock 17 days after transplantation. A second patient received a pneumatic artificial heart 7 days after transplantation when the heart transplant failed. He has been in stable condition for 45 days but is recovering from renal failure. Our early experiences indicate that either partial or total mechanical support as a bridge to transplantation is successful if overwhelming sepsis or renal failure can be avoided.\r"

High-risk subgroups include patients who have experienced sudden cardiac death and have been resuscitated successfully, patients with high-grade ventricular ectopy associated with left ventricular dysfunction, and patients who have had recent myocardial infarction. Traditional and experimental antiarrhythmic agents are available to the clinician, and in some patients combination therapy may prove more useful than application of a single agent alone. In individuals in whom pharmacologic intervention fails, map-guided surgical excision may be beneficial. The application of the automatic implantable defibrillator appears to have promise in truly refractory situations.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1978 and 1983, 1127 patients with de-novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were entered into the Medical Research Council (MRC)'s 8th AML trial. All received the same induction therapy consisting of daunorubicin, cytarabine, and 6-thioguanine--DAT (1 + 5). The 67% who entered complete remission were randomised to consolidation with two or six further courses of DAT. Adults under the age of 55 were randomised for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis with intrathecal cytarabine and methotrexate. Finally, those still in remission after 1 year of cytarabine and 6-thioguanine (AT) maintenance were randomised to receive either late intensification with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, cytarabine, and prednisolone (COAP) or continued AT. The median survival for the whole group was 12 months; the median duration of first remission was 15 months, with relapse-free survival at 5 years estimated at 18%. The factors most strongly associated with poor survival were performance status and age at presentation, but even among those over 60 years of age, half went into remission. Six courses of DAT consolidation gave a small advantage over two courses in reducing the number of late relapses but no significant survival advantage. Late intensification showed a marginally significant advantage over continued AT maintenance. The incidence of CNS relapse was low and unaffected by prophylaxis. The second remission rate varied from 10% when the first remission was shorter than 6 months to 61% when it had continued for more than 2 years. 40 patients received histocompatible allogeneic bone-marrow transplants in first remission. There was a high procedure-related death rate, particularly among patients over 30 years of age. Thus, initially at least, the transplanted group had shorter survival than a comparable group of chemotherapy-treated patients. Treatment specifications remained unchanged throughout the trial but those enrolled in the later half of the trial had a better (p = 0.003) survival.\r"

  ".W": "A self-contained enzymic membrane immunoassay (SCEMIA) system has been developed for the detection of viral antigens in clinical samples. The assay system makes use of antiviral antibodies bound to a nylon membrane, a flow-through washing procedure, and a clearly visible endpoint of the enzymic reaction. A SCEMIA system with antibodies against rotavirus detected rotavirus antigen, within 15 min, in all faecal samples from children with gastroenteritis that were positive for antigen in a standard microplate enzyme immunoassay, which took 4 h to complete. In addition, the SCEMIA could detect rotavirus in faecal samples collected from infected individuals both before and after antigen could be detected by a standard immunoassay system. Rotavirus antigen was not detectable in control children who did not have evidence of rotavirus infection. SCEMIA systems are an accurate, rapid, and inexpensive means for the practical diagnosis of viral infections in human beings.\r"
