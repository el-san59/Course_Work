  ".W": "The livers of 345 autopsy cases of chronic liver disease were examined for macroregenerative nodule (MRN), a large nodular lesion more than 10 mm in diameter. A total of 86 lesions of MRN was found in 49 cases (14.2%): 32 were from 191 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 16 were from 148 cases of cirrhosis only, and one was from six cases of chronic hepatitis. The incidence (19.6%) and the size (12.1 mm) of MRN in macronodular type of cirrhosis were significantly higher and larger than those in other types of cirrhosis. Also, the average size of MRN lesions of cases with HCC (12 mm) was significantly larger than that of cases with cirrhosis only (10.5 mm). The incidence of liver cell dysplasia (LCD) in cases of MRN (67.3%) was significantly higher than that in cases without MRN (40.9%). The MRN lesions were divided into Type I and Type II, the latter having proliferative foci distinguishable from the surrounding tissue. Three of them contained atypical cells regarded as cancer. Type II lesions were larger in size, and cases with multiple MRN lesions were seen more frequently in cases of HCC. The average age of the patients with Type II lesion was 5 years older than those with Type I lesions. These findings suggest that MRN should not be ignored in the morphogenesis of HCC.\r"

Preoperative embolizations were made for diagnostic and possible surgical adjuvant purposes. Extensive postembolization necrosis was common in tumors less than 5 cm in diameter, and tumor markers usually decreased temporarily after treatment. There were moderate side effects of pain, fever and nausea, and an acceptable complication and mortality rate with no deaths after embolization alone. This warrants further research on the method, which also seemed to improve the detection rate for small hepatocellular carcinomas.\r"

Significant palliation was achieved in 40 of 65 (62%) symptomatic lesions. There was no correlation between total dose or dose fraction size and significant palliation. Brain and bone metastases were separately analyzed. Nineteen of 28 (68%) bone metastases were palliated. Appendicular bony metastases were more likely to be palliated than axial bony metastases (88% versus 60%). The palliation of bone metastases did not depend on total dose given or fraction size. Nine of 23 (39%) symptomatic brain metastases were palliated. There was no difference in the rate of palliation between solitary and multiple brain metastases. Palliation of brain lesions was not dependent on fraction size, although there was a trend to better palliation with higher total doses. These findings suggest that unlike treating cutaneous or nodal melanoma lesions for local control, there is no advantage in large fraction size when treating with palliative intent visceral melanoma lesions.\r"

Lung cancer was treated with sequential intravenous cisplatin 100 mg/m2 (day 1), 5-FU 40 mg/m2/hour X 72 (days 2-5), and etoposide 80 mg/m2/day X 3 (days 2, 3, and 4). All patients had symptomatic relief and tumor regression after oncolytic chemotherapy, which was well tolerated with no hematologic toxicity. After the second or third cycle of chemotherapy, bronchoesophageal fistula occurred in all four patients with manifestations of pneumonia, which proved fatal in two patients. The other two patients were effectively palliated for 14 and 36+ weeks after celestin tube placement. Bronchoesophageal fistula should be managed by antibiotics and respiratory support followed by elective placement of celestin tube in most patients and by esophageal exclusion or esophageal bypass in a few select patients. In aerodigestive cancers, respiratory tract fistula may be a rare and potentially fatal complication of chemotherapy induced tumor lysis.\r"

  ".U": "88079888\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1976 and 1985, 155 patients from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Veterans Administration Hospital, and the Fox Chase Cancer Center were divided into groups, each of which was treated with one of three preoperative radiotherapy regimens to be followed by cystectomy. Patients initially were treated with 4000 cGy during 4 weeks followed by cystectomy (16 patients). Beginning in 1978, patients received 2000 cGy in 1 week prior to surgery (70 patients). Since 1982, 40 patients were treated with 500 cGy on the day prior to surgery with postoperative radiation therapy reserved for patients with either involved margins of resection, advanced stage or high grade. A fourth group of 20 patients was either not offered or refused preoperative radiation. Nine patients received only postoperative radiation therapy. The 5-year actuarial disease-free survival for pathologic Stages B2, C, and D lesions (T3-4, N0-2), was 63% for those who had received high-dose radiation versus 21% for those that had low-dose or no radiation. Patients with advanced pathologic stage disease who had received greater than 2000 cGy had a reduced rate of local failure (11% versus 27% for those who had received less treatment). Patients with abnormal upper tracts as shown on the intravenous pyelograms (IVP) had a reduced 5-year determinate survival of 23% versus 65% for patients with normal upper tracts. This condition did not independently affect survival, but rather reflected advanced stage. Patients with abnormal creatinine levels had a decreased survival that was independent of stage. Computed tomography was found to have low sensitivity for determining extravesical extension (39%) and metastatic lymphadenopathy (12%). Patients with clinical Stage B2 and C disease (T3) that were downstaged had a 63% 5-year survival versus 18% of those that were not downstaged. The incidence of both ureteroenteral strictures and stomal complications was found to be higher in the 2000 cGy group than in those patients treated with the other regimens. The overall incidence of complications in that group was also significantly greater. We conclude that there is a continuing role for adjuvant radiotherapy in invasive bladder carcinoma to improve both pelvic control and survival. The 500 cGy radiotherapy \"sandwich\" regimen was equal in terms of pelvic control and survival to the other regimens and showed less overall morbidity. The 2000 cGy regimen was associated with the greatest incidence of morbidity and did not substantially improve pelvic control.\r"

All of the women studied underwent mammography after the discovery of the cancer, which was proven by biopsy; the cancer did not involve the skin. All mammograms that demonstrated any abnormality in the area of the cancer were deemed to be positive. This study demonstrates that 22% of the women who have a palpable cancer of the breast will have a false-negative mammogram; 44% will be women of 50 and younger, and 13% will be women more than 50 years of age. Mammography is detrimental if used to avoid biopsy when there is a persistent mass, especially in younger women. It is concluded that biopsy should be performed on every undiagnosed, persistent, dominant mass without consideration of the mammogram.\r"

In addition to the pathologic diagnosis, the histologic features assessed included epithelial hyperplasia and atypia, intralobular fibrosis, and extralobular fibrosis. Among premenopausal women, those with marked intralobular fibrosis were more likely to have large (3+ mm) nodular densities on the mammogram. Among postmenopausal women, epithelial hyperplasia or atypia was related to having nodular densities in at least 40% of the breast volume. In both groups, marked extralobular fibrosis was related to the presence of homogeneous density on the mammogram. We conclude that mammographic nodular densities may be an expression of lobular characteristics, whereas homogeneous density may reflect extralobular connective tissue changes.\r"

  ".W": "Melanoma is characterized by a tendency to metastasize widely throughout the body and its relative affinity for gallium-67. Because of the ability of this nuclide to image tumor sites in numerous organ systems, it has been used to detect metastases in patients with malignant melanoma. The effectiveness of this technique, however, has been controversial. This article documents the retrospective analysis of results from 296 gallium-67 scintiscans from 222 patients with melanoma. Patients were placed in two groups. The low suspicion group (148 patients undergoing 191 scans) consisted of patients with no evidence of disease; the gallium scans were performed solely for screening purposes. There were 175 true-negative scans, nine true-positive scans (eight of the nine were positive only at the untreated primary site), three false-negative scans, and four false-positive scans. Therefore, in only one patient (0.5%) did a \"screening\" gallium scan reveal disease that was not expected. The high suspicion group (85 patients undergoing 105 scans) consisted of patients with established evidence of metastatic disease; the gallium scan was performed to confirm those findings and to search for involvement of other organ systems. Of these scans, ten were true-negative, 73 true-positive, 21 false-negative, and one false-positive. In this group the 20% false-negative results indicate that gallium scanning is considerably less sensitive than the combination of clinical and standard radiographic assessment. It was concluded that gallium-67 scintiscanning of patients with melanoma, whether for screening or evaluation of patients with known metastases, provides little information that affects clinical staging or therapeutic design. Therefore, the technique is of limited value for routinely investigating the extent of disease.\r"

  ".W": "During the 27-year period from 1956 to 1982, transvaginal parametrial needle biopsies were performed on 76 patients clinically suspected of harboring postirradiation recurrent cervical cancer without mucosal lesions suitable for biopsy under direct vision. Needle biopsies indicated cancer in 41 patients, resulting in 20 abdominal explorations. Eleven of these patients underwent total pelvic exenteration. Three patients survived longer than 5 years. Among 35 patients whose biopsies did not suggest cancer, eight proved to be false-negative as demonstrated by later progression of local and systemic disease. The remaining 27 patients in whom biopsies showed negative results were cured by radiation therapy. Bleeding, easily controlled by vaginal packing, occurred in one patient; in another, a pelvic abscess was drained 7 days after the biopsy. The authors conclude that when judiciously performed, transvaginal parametrial needle biopsy has a high diagnostic yield (89%) with minimal morbidity (2.6%). Its application during the careful observation of patients suspected to harbor recurrence may increase the operability rate and may offer selected patients a chance for cure by radical pelvic surgery.\r"

The survival probability of patients with initial levels of gammaglobulin of less than 700 mg/dl was significantly lower (P = 0.03) than in patients with initial levels of 700 mg/dl or more. Decreased initial levels of IgG and IgA also were associated with reduced survival probability (P = 0.027 and P = 0.014, respectively), whereas hypo-IgM did not show any influence on survival. When the influence on survival of gammaglobulin and immunoglobulin concentration was analyzed by Cox's multivariate model, the only variable which entered the regression at significant level was IgA (P = 0.006). As shown by the same type of analysis, the prognostic value of hypo-IgA is independent from the clinical staging. The natural history of hypogammaglobulinemia and hypoimmunoglobulinemia was investigated by sequential analysis in a series of untreated patients. The appearance of decreased levels of these globulins was found to be a continuous process developing spontaneously during the untreated course of the disease. Among factors associated with the appearance of hypogammaglobulinemia during the evolution of CLL, initial lower levels of IgG and IgA, but not IgM, were found in a multivariate analysis.\r"

In peripheral lymphocyte type, the number of OKT-6+ cells are less than that of OKT-3+ cells and less than 10%. In intermediate type, OKT-6+ cells are between 10% and 30%. These three types correlate well with the histologic features with respect to the number and distribution of lymphocytes in thymoma tissue.

  ".W": "There is increasing evidence for the therapeutic effectiveness of Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in malignant diseases. However, the antitumor mechanisms of IFN-alpha are not known. Using two examples, hairy Cell leukemia (HCL) and renal cell cancer (RCC), it is shown that the requirements for successful IFN-alpha therapy of HCL and RCC are different. In HCL low doses of IFN-alpha are sufficient to treat the disease. The reduction of hairy cells in peripheral blood is detectable within the first week of treatment. The endogenous IFN-alpha production in these patients is impaired as demonstrated by the lack of IFN-alpha induction and by low levels of 2-5 oligoadenylate synthetase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A possible reason for deficient endogenous IFN-alpha production is the lack of monocytes in HCL patients. It is likely that therapy with low doses of IFN-alpha substitutes for the endogenous IFN-alpha deficiency. In RCC comparatively high doses of IFN-alpha are necessary for a clinical response. There may be differences between the effectiveness of natural and recombinant alpha interferons. High doses given within a week seem to be more important than high single doses, which therefore suggests the need of daily treatment. Responses of RCC to IFN-alpha therapy are usually seen several months after the beginning of therapy. These differences in the effectiveness of IFN-alpha therapy for HCL and RCC suggest that IFN-alpha acts differently in the treatment of each disease.\r"

In the UV group, the helper T-lymphocytes/suppressor T-lymphocytes (Th/Ts) ratio was abnormally low (P less than 0.01) compared with the ratios of the x-ray and control groups. The low Th/Ts ratio was associated with an absolute increase in the number of Ts. This suggests that heavy sun exposure may cause a permanent increase in the number of Ts in certain persons.

Eighteen of the 29 tumors showing positive argyrophil reactions also had argentaffin cells.

After adjusting for stage, residual tumor mass, histopathologic type, treatment, and age of patient in a Cox regression analysis, the relative risk of death was two-fold higher in single DNA-aneuploid and sixfold higher in DNA-multiploid tumors as compared to DNA-diploid tumors (P less than 0.0001). A tetraploid DNA index was associated with a relatively low risk ratio, whereas hypertetraploid tumors were highly malignant. S-phase fraction (SPF) had prognostic value especially in DNA-diploid tumors. The simultaneous evaluation of DNA index, the number of aneuploid cell clones, and SPF gave more prognostic information than the determination of tumor ploidy alone. On the basis of these parameters we have developed a classification of tumor DNA histograms for better prognostic assessment of ovarian cancer.\r"

We have studied 30 tumors of this type. The patients averaged 34 years of age. Forty percent of the tumors were synchronously bilateral and 30% were associated with endometriosis. Four tumors were complicated by peritoneal implants, one by both peritoneal implants and lymph node metastasis and one by lymph node metastasis alone. No patient had pseudomyxoma peritonei. Follow-up information was available on all the patients for a mean interval of 3.7 years. In two cases tumors developed in the conserved contralateral ovary; no deaths occurred. These tumors have important clinical and pathologic differences from mucinous borderline tumors with intestinal differentiation, but have many similarities to mixed-epithelial borderline tumors of Mullerian type.\r"

Within the Ewing's sarcoma trial, patients with chest wall lesions were particularly analysed for MPNT features. The period of observation ranged from 15 to 86 months; the median relapse-free time was 24 months. There were 28 male and 14 female patients, the median age of patients was 15 years (range, 9 months-23 years). Thirty-two patients had localized disease (M0), and ten patients presented with primary metastases (M1). The predominant location of the tumors was the thoracopulmonary region, followed by the extremities, the abdominal/pelvic, and head and neck region. Thirty-one of 42 tumors involved the adjacent bone. The disease-free survival according to Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis was 56% +/- 11% for Stage M0 patients at 3 years. Nine of ten patients with M1 disease showed progression of their disease. Most patients had combined modality treatment with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Best results were obtained with extensive surgery. Radiation doses ranged from 20 to 60 Gy and could not be correlated with the outcome of the disease. Most recurrences occurred at the site of the primary tumor. In patients with primary chemotherapy after biopsy-proven diagnosis, the responsiveness of this disease to chemotherapy could be demonstrated. Combination chemotherapy containing anthracyclines and high doses of alkylating agents appeared superior.\r"

Forty-five women with no previous chemotherapy experience who were receiving a single regimen of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer were interviewed before and after their first six infusions. Seventy-one percent of patients developed PTN. The PTN was related to the following: patients' physical status at the onset of treatment; heightened anxiety during infusions; susceptibility to nausea and vomiting after eating certain foods; and expectations of developing chemotherapy-related nausea. Anxiety during infusions, susceptibility to nausea and vomiting, and expectations of side effects also accounted for differences in the frequency, intensity, and severity of PTN. These findings offer strong support for the view that nonpharmacologic factors contribute to individual differences in gastrointestinal responses to chemotherapy.\r"

Within this population 220 second cancers were diagnosed at sites other than the prostate as compared with 181.2 cancers expected based upon incidence rates for the local general population. Excesses of second malignancies were found in the urethra, kidney and bladder, as well as for melanoma of the skin. The increased risk of second neoplasms was generally greater in men younger than 70. The associated genitourinary malignancies tended to occur within 3 years of the prostatic cancer. Although increased clinical surveillance of this population could explain some of the observed excess of second cancers, these findings also are consistent with multiple cancers arising from shared etiologic factors.\r"

White men (n = 332) between the ages of 21 and 84 with bladder cancer were compared with 686 population-based controls. Cigarette smokers were classified by current smoking status as well as by amount, duration, inhalation patterns, age at first having smoked, and years since having stopped smoking. These variables were associated with a change in the risk for bladder cancer. The population-attributable risk associated with cigarette smoking was 48.5%. Risks from the use of other tobacco products such as cigars, pipes, snuff, and chewing tobacco, and from caffeinated coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages were evaluated in light of cigarette smoking status. Cigarette smoking was shown to be both a confounder and an effect modifier. Risk estimates for bladder cancer associated with caffeinated coffee and alcoholic beverages were decreased after controlling for the effects of cigarette smoking. However, an increased risk of developing bladder cancer from cigar smoking (Odds ratio [OR] = 2.46) and tea drinking (OR = 3.14) was only seen in men who never smoked cigarettes. An increased but not significant risk was also seen for pipe, snuff, and chewing tobacco use in noncigarette smokers. The population-attributable risk from cigars and tea in the population of white men who had never smoked was 6.3% and 18.9%, respectively. Our results suggest that cigarette smoking may obscure other risk factors unless those who never smoked are separately studied.\r"

Histologically, the spermatocytic seminoma in both cases consisted of three distinct cell types as has been previously described. Ultrastructurally, one case showed crystalloid structures similar to the Lubarsch's crystalloids described in spermatogonia of human testis. The sarcomatous component in one case was a rhabdomyosarcoma confirmed by light and by electron microscopic study whereas the second case was a primitive mesenchymal spindle cell sarcoma. Only the sarcomatous element metastasized; metastatic sites included lung and paraaortic lymph nodes in the first patient and lung and liver in the second. Despite aggressive treatment with combined surgery and multiagent chemotherapy, the first patient died within 1 year of diagnosis and the second at 14 months.\r"

Pial arterioles were observed directly using a closed cranial window in chloralose-anesthetized piglets. Topical application of 10-100 ng/ml PAF produced dose-dependent decreases in pial arteriolar diameter; diameters were 193 +/- 27 microns for control, 167 +/- 25 microns at 10 ng/ml, and 129 +/- 21 microns at 100 ng/ml. Topical application of 30-300 ng/ml norepinephrine and 3-30 ng/ml U46619, a purported thromboxane A2 receptor agonist, also produced dose-dependent decreases in pial arteriolar diameter. After topical administration of U66985 (1 microgram/ml), a putative PAF antagonist, responses to PAF were attenuated significantly, but responses to norepinephrine and U46619 were unchanged. Moreover, intravenously administered U66985 (0.1 mg/kg) antagonized PAF responses as well. Responses to PAF were unchanged after cyclooxygenase and leukotriene receptor inhibition. Further, PAF did not increase cortical subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid prostaglandin or leukotriene levels. These data indicate that PAF is a potent constrictor of cerebral arterioles in newborn pigs and that its mechanism of action is independent of formation of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid metabolism. These data also suggest that U66985 may be a selective PAF antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier. Since PAF is an endogenous lipid released from a variety of tissues and may be an important mediator of inflammation and allergic reaction, PAF could be involved in the pathophysiology of the cerebral circulation in the perinatal period.\r"

The effects of coronary artery occlusion for 3 hours and reperfusion for 1 week were examined on measurements of left ventricular function, ischemic-zone wall thickness, regional myocardial blood flow, arrhythmias, and extent of necrosis. The experimental group of animals (n = 7) was treated with the calcium channel blocker nisoldipine (0.1 microgram/kg/min) from 1 hour after coronary occlusion to 3 hours after coronary reperfusion. The control group (n = 6) received the vehicle (n = 4) or saline (n = 2). The effects of coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion on arterial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, heart rate, and left ventricular dP/dt were similar in both groups. Systolic wall thickening was reversed to paradoxical wall thinning during occlusion in both groups, and there was no recovery to systolic wall thickening over the 1-week period in either group. There were differences in regional blood flow; during coronary artery occlusion, nisoldipine increased blood flow significantly in the endocardium and epicardium of nonischemic and ischemic zones. There was a major difference in the number of arrhythmic beats per minute on reperfusion; during reperfusion, the number of arrhythmias rose markedly in the vehicle-treated group but actually fell in the nisoldipine-treated group. The size of areas at risk, infarcts, infarcts related to the area at risk, and amount of total creatine kinase (CK) and MB-CK appearing in blood were not significantly different in the two groups. Thus, in the conscious baboon, nisoldipine administered 1 hour after coronary artery occlusion exerted a marked effect in diminishing reperfusion-induced arrhythmias and improved blood flow to the ischemic zone during occlusion but did not salvage ischemic tissue.\r"

  ".U": "88080883\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have denied the presence of a transient outward current (Ito) in ventricular myocardium of dog, sheep, and calf. Using conventional microelectrode techniques, we provide evidence for a significant contribution of Ito to epicardial, but not endocardial, activity of canine ventricular myocardium. The epicardial action potential when compared with that of endocardium shows a smaller phase 0 amplitude, a much more prominent phase 1, and a phase 2 amplitude that is greater than that of phase 0. Epicardial action potentials, unlike those of endocardium, display a \"spike and dome\" morphology that becomes progressively more accentuated at slower stimulation rates. Using the restitution of phase 1 amplitude as a marker for the process responsible for the spike and dome phenomenon, we were able to delineate two exponential components: 1) a slow component that recovers with a time constant of 350-570 msec and 2) a fast component with a time constant of 41-85 msec. The slow component was largely abolished by 1-5 mM 4-aminopyridine, an Ito blocker. The fast component was diminished by 4-aminopyridine, but it was also inhibited by ryanodine and by Sr2+ replacement of Ca2+, which are interventions known to inhibit the Ca2+-activated component of Ito. Following 4-aminopyridine and Sr2+ or ryanodine treatment, the epicardial responses more closely resembled those of endocardium. In summary, the data demonstrate a marked heterogeneity of active membrane properties in canine ventricular muscle. These observations may aid in understanding the basis for rate-dependent changes in the T wave of the ECG, supernormal conduction in ventricular muscle, the greater sensitivity of epicardium to ischemia, and the rate dependence of some cardiac arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "The normal cardiac cycle is associated with dynamic changes in left ventricular shape, which can be disturbed in disease states. To assess the influences of diastolic volume, percent ejected volume, and abnormalities of acute or chronic systolic loading on general and detailed chamber geometry, we studied dynamic shape change recorded by x-ray contrast ventriculography in both normal patients and those with aortic (AR) or mitral (MR) valve regurgitation. While both lesions increased diastolic volume, the character of load throughout ejection differed markedly. Detailed cavity geometry was assessed by a Fourier analysis technique and general shape by eccentricity and circularity indexes. Normal hearts, showed increased systolic elongation by all indexes. AR patients displayed a similar rise in eccentricity during ejection; however, the extent of shape change when measured by Fourier and circular indexes was reduced. In contrast, MR patients displayed enhanced systolic shape change, particularly in chamber elongation. Neither simple eccentricity of circular indexes adequately differentiated these shape abnormalities, whereas detailed Fourier geometric analysis precisely characterized the abnormalities of shape change in these two diseases. Relations between the extent of shape change and ejected volume for each patient group revealed significantly more systolic deformation with a different shape versus volume relation for the MR hearts as compared with AR and controls. Thus, while dynamic left ventricular shape is certainly influenced by the extent of volume change, it also varies independently from volume related to the specific nature of loading during ejection.\r"

  ".W": "Single canine Purkinje cells were voltage clamped under Ca2+-free conditions using the patch pipette. Depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of -42 mV induced a time-dependent rapidly activating-slowly inactivating outward current, which was identified as the transient outward current. The current showed two exponential time constants of inactivation (48,352 msec at +58 mV and 53,325 msec at +78 mV). Norepinephrine in concentrations exceeding 10(-9) M modified the inactivation kinetics of this current without affecting the activation kinetics. The half-maximum dose for norepinephrine effect was 1.9 X 10(-8) M, and the effect was saturated at 10(-6) M. Norepinephrine reduced the amplitude of the fast time constant component of inactivation, while increasing the amplitude of the slow component, without changing their time constants. Norepinephrine also increased the amplitude of a time-independent current component. The beta-antagonist sotalol blocked the norepinephrine effect on the transient outward current. On the other hand, both activation of adenyl cyclase by forskolin and increase of intracellular cAMP concentration produced the same effect as exposure to norepinephrine. These results suggest a role for neurotransmitter regulation of the transient outward current in cardiac cells, perhaps by channel phosphorylation.\r"

The atrioventricular node contains a higher concentration of beta-adrenoceptors than the adjacent interventricular septum.

  ".W": "Although group III and IV fibers are known to compose the afferent pathway of the reflex arc causing the pressor response to static muscular contraction, little is known about the neurotransmitters released by these muscle afferents. Somatostatin might be one of these neurotransmitters because this peptide is found in the terminals of fine afferent fibers ending in the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord. Therefore, in chloralose-anesthetized cats, the reflex pressor response to static contraction was examined before and after subarachnoid injections onto the lumbosacral cord of a peptide antagonist to somatostatin. We found that before giving the antagonist, the pressor response to contraction of the triceps surae muscles in 12 cats averaged 33 +/- 4 mm Hg, while 37 +/- 7 minutes after giving the antagonist, the pressor response averaged only 18 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). In contrast, the antagonist to somatostatin had no effect on either the pressor response to electrical stimulation of the cut central end of the sciatic nerve or the pressor response to stimulation of the posterior diencephalon. Furthermore, subarachnoid injection of a peptide antagonist to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone had no effect on the reflex pressor response to static contraction. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that somatostatin plays a role in the spinal transmission of the contraction-induced pressor reflex arising from hind limb skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a vasoconstrictor peptide known to be present in the adrenal medulla, the terminal nerve endings, and in plasma. This study was designed to test whether NPY could prevent the acute blood pressure fall induced by endotoxin administration. Normotensive rats were subjected to adrenal demedullation on the right side and were either adrenalectomized or sham-operated on the left side. Eight to ten days later, NPY (0.07 microgram/min i.v.) or its vehicle were infused for 95 minutes into these conscious, semirestrained rats. The same experiments were performed with rats that received an infusion of epinephrine (0.1 microgram/min). These doses of NPY and epinephrine when given alone had no blood pressure effect. During the last 75 minutes of the 95-minute infusion, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide Escherichia coli 0.111:B4, 10 micrograms/min i.v.) or its vehicle were administered. In rats with an intact adrenal gland, endotoxin failed to induce hypotension. In rats lacking a functioning adrenal medulla, however, endotoxin induced a pronounced mean blood pressure fall of 55 +/- 11.6 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM). This blood pressure drop could be prevented equally well with NPY and with epinephrine infusion and averaged 11 +/- 2.3 and 16 +/- 2.4 mm Hg, respectively, at the end of the experiment. Additional rats were biadrenalectomized and supplemented with an excess of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. In these rats also, NPY markedly attenuated the blood pressure fall resulting from endotoxemia. These data taken together indicate that in conscious rats with no adrenal medulla, the acute blood pressure fall induced by endotoxin administration is greatly enhanced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors exist on vascular smooth muscle of microvessels and whether adrenergic constriction of anatomically distinct microvascular segments is differentially subserved by either receptor subtype. The cremaster skeletal muscle of anesthetized rats was acutely denervated and suspended in a Krebs bath containing cocaine, normetanephrine, and propranolol to block uptake1, uptake2, and beta-receptors, respectively. Intravital microscopy was used to study large distributing arterioles (mean diameter, 100 microns), small precapillary arterioles (25 microns), and capacitance venules (140 microns). Concentration-response (diameter change) curves were obtained for bath-added agonists norepinephrine (mixed alpha 1/alpha 2), phenylephrine (alpha 1), and B-HT 933 (alpha 2) in the absence or presence of antagonists prazosin (alpha 1) and yohimbine (alpha 2). Apparent pD2(-log ED50) values for large arterioles and venules were, respectively, as follows: norepinephrine (7.41 and 7.15), phenylephrine (5.95 and 5.41), and B-HT 933 (5.05 and 5.06). Low concentrations of prazosin (10(-8) M) and yohimbine (10(-7) M) produced receptor subtype-selective antagonism and parallel, dextral displacement of norepinephrine curves for large arterioles and venules. The large arteriole pKB (-log KB) was 7.83 +/- 0.65 for prazosin and 7.36 +/- 0.46 for yohimbine. Higher concentrations of prazosin (10(-7) and 3 X 10(-7) M) and yohimbine (10(-6) M) produced further dextral but nonparallel displacement of norepinephrine curves. In contrast, receptor subtype-selective concentrations of only yohimbine inhibited adrenergic constriction of small, precapillary arterioles; but prazosin had no effect at receptor subtype-selective concentrations. These data suggest that adrenergic regulation of large arterioles and venules in skeletal muscle uses both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Precapillary arterioles, however, may be subserved predominantly by alpha 2-receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Perfusion of isolated rat heart with L-methionine produced a positive inotropic effect that was temporally preceded, as well as accompanied, by an increase of methyl group incorporation into N-methylated phospholipids of the myocardium. Maximal increase in contractile force development was associated with maximal methyl group incorporation. Both parameters showed a dose-related dependence on methionine and correlated positively (r = 0.965) upon regression analysis of the data. The presence of adenosine, L-homocysteine thiolactone and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine in the perfusion medium inhibited the positive inotropic effect as well as the incorporation of methyl groups into phospholipids. Cycloleucine, an inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, also reduced the increase in contractility by methionine. Methionine-induced positive inotropic effect could be modulated by varying Ca2+ concentration in the perfusate and was inhibited by ryanodine, a blocker of sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ release. These observations indicate that L-methionine may serve as a powerful positive inotropic agent and suggest that phospholipid N-methylation plays an important role in functional activity of rat heart.\r"

Previous studies of the mechanical properties of cerebral vessels in chronic hypertension have examined large cerebral arteries. The goals of this study were first to develop a method to examine vascular mechanics of cerebral arterioles in vivo and second to determine whether the stiffness of cerebral arterioles is altered in the presence of chronic hypertension. We calculated circumferential stress and strain of pial arterioles in age-matched, anesthetized stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and in Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) from measurements of pial arteriolar pressure, inner diameter, and wall thickness. Pial arteriolar pressure was measured with a servonull system. Smooth muscle of pial arterioles was deactivated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and pressure-diameter relations were examined during step-wise reductions in pressure. Prior to deactivation of smooth muscle in 3-4-month-old rats, pial arteriolar pressure was greater in SHRSP than in WKY (110 +/- 4 versus 75 +/- 2 mm Hg [mean +/- SE]; p less than 0.05). Pial arteriolar diameter, which was measured at prevailing levels of pial arteriolar pressure, was less in SHRSP than in WKY (52 +/- 5 versus 63 +/- 3 microns; p less than 0.05). Following deactivation of smooth muscle, diameter of pial arterioles at 70 mm Hg of pial arteriolar pressure was similar in the two groups: 104 +/- 6 microns in SHRSP and 109 +/- 3 microns in WKY (p greater than 0.05). Wall thickness was 4.5 +/- 0.2 microns in SHRSP and 4.1 +/- 0.1 microns in WKY (p greater than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A modified test of postextrasystolic potentiation achieved with a brief episode of rapid pacing followed by a 6-second pause (RPP maneuver) was used to evoke maximal force in isolated intact ferret right ventricular papillary muscles. Maximal RPP tensions were examined under length-clamped conditions and compared with the steady-state forces obtained when further increases in [Ca2+]o, did not further increase force and to the tensions recorded at the point of saturation of force when similarly length-clamped muscles were subjected to caffeine-induced tetanization. The results show that the calculated maximal twitch tension achieved with RPP is comparable to the 25-35 g/mm2 observed in intact single skeletal muscle fibers. The study also shows that the beat-to-beat decay of the potentiated contraction is exponential. While the amount of the constant fractional beat-to-beat decay is a function of [Ca2+]o, it is not influenced by length. During the decay of potentiation, the ratio of the potentiation of any beat divided by that of the previous beat is a constant, called (X). With certain assumptions, it is shown that (X) is a measure of the fraction of activator calcium taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum in each beat and, in the steady state, the fraction of activator calcium that comes from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The (X) amounted to 33%, 50%, and 65% when [Ca2+]o was 1.25, 2.50, and 5.0 mM, respectively. Thus, at 1.25 mM [Ca2+]o, some two thirds of the total calcium required to activate the myofilaments comes from the extracellular compartment during excitation and only one third is contributed via release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In the region of optimal myofilament overlap, RPP force-length curves are remarkably shallow and almost indistinguishable from the sarcomere length-tension relation observed in skinned single cardiac cells. Tetanus plateau tensions are significantly smaller than RPP forces at any length, and the slope of the tetanus force-length curves is greater than that obtained with RPP. Thus, and by exclusion, we also suggest that caffeine may exert significant downstream inhibitory effects.\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of evidence, including the reported ability of calcium channel blockers to prevent atherogenesis in cholesterol-fed rabbits, suggest that calcium mediates one or more of the pathologic changes in atherosclerosis. Moreover, it has long been known that calcium accumulates in atherosclerotic blood vessels. To test the hypothesis that a substantial fraction of this accumulated calcium is intracellular and to identify possible causes of this accumulation, calcium fluxes and contents were determined in aortic segments from cholesterol-fed rabbits and age-matched controls. A new method, based on 45Ca efflux experiments and computer-assisted kinetic analysis, was used to measure intracellular and extracellular calcium contents (nmol calcium/g wet wt tissue) and fluxes. Total intracellular calcium increased from 269 +/- 11.6 to 1,300 +/- 352 nmol/g in cholesterol-fed animals compared with controls (p less than 0.01). This change was sufficient to account for the observed increase in total tissue calcium from 4,190 +/- 211 to 5,240 +/- 477 nmol/g (p less than 0.05). Thus, the fraction of tissue calcium that is intracellular increased significantly from 0.065 +/- 0.006 to 0.223 +/- 0.048 (p less than 0.01) in experimental atherosclerosis. In addition, the data were quantitatively consistent with the hypothesis that these changes are brought about by a 4.8-fold increase in the plasma membrane calcium permeability of aortic smooth muscle cells. These results provide evidence that increased intracellular calcium is a possible mediator of cholesterol-induced atherogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium uptake was measured in homogenates and microsomal preparations enriched in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from hearts of hypertrophic (BIO 14.6) and dilated (BIO 53.58) cardiomyopathic as well as control (F1B) Syrian hamsters at 3, 7, 9, and 11 months of age. Calcium uptake studies were done using the Millipore filtration technique under conditions known to restrict transport to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Steady-state calcium uptake capacity was used as a measure of the relative amounts of sarcoplasmic reticulum in homogenates prepared from individual hearts. At 3 months of age, there were no differences in calcium uptake in homogenates from control or myopathic hearts. However, by 9 months, although calcium uptake of homogenates from control and hypertrophic hearts was the same, calcium uptake by homogenates from dilated hearts was significantly depressed both in initial rate and capacity. Similar trends were seen in the microsomal vesicle preparations, but the decrease in calcium uptake in the dilated hearts was significantly lower by 3 months of age. The catalytic activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum transport enzyme was estimated from the ratio of velocity to capacity, which provides a measure of the fractional rate of filling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum with calcium. The velocity-to-capacity ratios were not different at any of the ages in both the homogenate and microsomal preparations. The results of this study demonstrate that a major defect in the dilated cardiomyopathy may be due to a decrease in the volume or number of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transport sites rather than a decrease in specific activity of the transport enzyme.\r"

Two of the dilators were acetylcholine and bradykinin, whose action in this vascular bed is dependent upon production of endothelium-dependent relaxing factors. The other two dilators were sodium nitroprusside and 8-bromo-cGMP, whose action is not endothelium dependent. The dilations by acetylcholine, bradykinin, and nitroprusside were significantly depressed by 10(-4) M methylene blue applied topically for 7 minutes prior to application of the dilators. The inhibitory effect was reversible, was greatest against acetylcholine, and was least against nitroprusside. These data parallel reports of methylene blue's action against these dilators when applied to large blood vessels in vitro. Our data appear to be the first microvascular data and the first in vivo data showing this effect. The data thus suggest that the mechanisms underlying dilation of cerebral arterioles and large extracerebral vessels are similar. The literature accounts for the effect of methylene blue on the basis of its action as an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase. Our data, including the failure of methylene blue to alter dilation by 8-bromo-cGMP, are in keeping with this hypothesis and with current beliefs that guanylate cyclase and cGMP have a central role in vasodilation. The data do not rule out the possibility that methylene blue has an additional action in the case of acetylcholine and inactivates the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor for that dilator.\r"

The goal of the experiments was to characterize the inhibitory effects of Bay K 8644 on the calcium channel, and identify the factors that influence the inhibition. Bay K 8644 was found to have strong calcium channel antagonist properties, which were both dose- and voltage-dependent. Channel block by Bay K 8644 had both a tonic and a use-dependent component. The stimulatory effect of the drug was found to have little obvious dependence on the holding potential. The accumulation of use-dependent block during trains of pulses was facilitated by faster rates of stimulation, longer pulse durations, and more positive holding potentials. Application of the drug induced the appearance of a second, slow component of calcium channel recovery. Both the time-constant and relative proportion of the slow component of recovery were found to be voltage-dependent. Bay K 8644 was also found to cause a hyperpolarizing shift of the inactivation curve for the calcium current, suggesting that it has strong interactions with the inactivated state of the calcium channel. Thus, Bay K 8644 has, along with its stimulatory effects, inhibitory effects that strongly resemble those of typical calcium channel antagonists.\r"

Their ages ranged from 9 months to 8 years. Younger patients were sedated with chloral hydrate (80 to 100 mg/kg) orally. MRI was performed with use of a General Electric Signa system operating at a field strength of 1.5 tesla. A body or head coil was used depending on the size of the patient. Images were obtained by use of a technique of gradient-recalled acquisition in steady state (GRASS) that utilizes a low flip angle and shorter repetition and echo times. Five patients had widely patent venae cavae and three had superior vena caval obstruction at the junction of the right atrium with a dilated azygos vein. There was no evidence of pulmonary venous obstruction in any of the patients. Right ventricular function was assessed in four patients and their ejection fractions ranged from 58% to 81%. Tricuspid and mitral regurgitation were observed in three and two patients, respectively. Both right and left ventricular outflow tracts were well visualized and showed no evidence of obstruction. Cine MRI is an entirely noninvasive, nonionizing, and safe procedure in young patients and appears to be a valuable alternative method for evaluating patients after surgical repair of D-TGA. With advancing technologies and an accumulation of experience with cine MRI, it appears that this new technique will play an important role in patient care for children with congenital heart disease.\r"

Electrical alternans was detected in both the QRS complex and the ST-T wave by use of a novel multidimensional spectral technique. The magnitude of the alteration was expressed as the alternating electrocardiographic morphology index (AEMI), expressed as parts per million of waveform energy. Electrical stability in the dog preparations was assessed via the ventricular fibrillation threshold measurement, and in the clinical studies via programmed stimulation. In 10 dog experiments, systemic hypothermia resulted in a 60% decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) (p less than .0001) and a significant increase in both AEMI(QRS) form 3.7 +/- 3.0 to 1448 +/- 548 (p less than .0001) and AEMI(ST-T) from 43.9 +/- 18.4 to 19,178 +/- 5579 (p less than .0001). In 10 dog experiments, transient coronary artery ligation also resulted in a 60% decrease in VFT (p less than .0001), an increase from 76.3 +/- 46.5 to 245 +/- 11 in AEMI(QRS) (p less than .05), and an increase from 842 +/- 505 to 1365 +/- 392 in AEMI(ST-T) (p less than .002). In 119 observations in 20 animal experiments, the rank correlation between VFT and AEMI(QRS) was -.30 (p less than .001), with that between VFT and AEMI(ST-T) being -.55 (p less than .0001). In a double-blind pilot clinical trial consisting of 23 studies in 19 patients, the result of electrophysiologic testing was used as an independent measure of cardiac electrical stability. Alternation in waveform morphology identified the inducible patient population with a sensitivity of 92%, a positive predictivity of 70%, and a specificity of 50% (p less than .05). We conclude that analysis of subtle beat-to-beat variability in electrocardiographic morphology may provide a noninvasive measure of cardiac electrical stability.\r"

The ECGs during sinus rhythm from many patients with sustained VT, however, exhibit intraventricular conduction abnormalities. Accordingly, this study was performed to determine whether the presence of bundle branch block during sinus rhythm precluded accurate identification of patients with sustained VT. Studies were performed in 28 normal subjects (group I) and 141 patients with organic heart disease grouped according to clinical characteristics. Group II comprised 40 patients without VT in whom the QRS duration during sinus rhythm was less than 120 msec. Group III included 21 patients without VT in whom the QRS duration during sinus rhythm was 120 msec or greater. Group IV comprised 43 patients with sustained VT having ECGs during sinus rhythm with QRS durations less than 120 msec. Group V included 37 patients with sustained VT in whom the QRS duration during sinus rhythm was 120 msec or greater. FFTs of the terminal QRS and ST segment of signal-averaged X, Y, and Z ECGs were computed. Transformed data were expressed as an FFT magnitude and the relative contribution and peak magnitudes of 20 to 50 Hz frequencies determined after first demonstrating that this FFT method was more appropriate, when compared with the energy spectrum, for analyzing ECG signals having a broad range of ST segment durations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A new operative technique of sequential map-guided subendocardial resection (SER) was used in 45 consecutive patients for the treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia due to coronary artery disease. This technique is characterized by map-guided SER or cryothermic ablation during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, followed by repeated sequences of programmed stimulation to assess adequacy of resection. The patients' mean age was 59 +/- 10 years and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 34 +/- 12%. Twenty-five (56%) patients had a history of myocardial infarction within the previous 2 months. After ventriculotomy, 34 patients (76%) had inducible monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. These patients underwent repeated sequences of ventricular tachycardia induction and mapping during normothermic bypass followed by successive SER or cryothermic ablation until sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was no longer inducible. Twenty-seven patients had a total of 60 discrete, mappable tachycardias induced and seven patients had 10 discrete tachycardias that were too fast to accurately map. In the remaining 11 patients, no ventricular tachycardia was inducible after ventriculotomy and SER, which included all visually identifiable scar, was performed. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 102 +/- 27 min. Forty-one of 45 patients (91%) survived to hospital discharge, and 35 of 41 patients (85%) had no inducible ventricular tachycardia at postoperative electrophysiologic evaluation performed in the absence of all antiarrhythmic drugs. The remaining six patients had no inducible ventricular tachycardia with drug therapy. All four operative nonsurvivors had refractory cardiac collapse preoperatively. Over 19 +/- 12 months of follow-up, there were four sudden cardiac deaths and no nonfatal recurrences of ventricular tachycardia. There were seven additional cardiac deaths. Actuarial cardiac survival was 0.57, and freedom from arrhythmic events was 0.76 at 42 months. Thus, in the absence of cardiogenic shock, the technique of sequential map-guided SER achieves: (1) a high operative survival with acceptable perfusion times, (2) excellent long-term arrhythmia control, and (3) survival comparable to that in patients with similar left ventricular function and no history of ventricular tachyarrhythmia.\r"

These patients underwent a combined regimen of low-fat/low-cholesterol diet and regular, supervised physical exercise at high intensity for 12 months. At 1 year serum lipoproteins has been lowered to ideal levels (serum cholesterol 202 +/- 31 mg/dl, low-density lipoproteins 130 +/- 30 mg/dl, very low-density lipoproteins 22 +/- 15 mg/dl, serum triglycerides 105 [69 to 304] mg/dl) and physical work capacity was improved by 21% (p less than .01). No significant effect was noted on high-density lipoproteins, probably as a result of the low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet. Stress-induced myocardial ischemia, as assessed by thallium-201 scintigraphy, was decreased by 54% (p less than .05) despite higher myocardial oxygen consumption. Eighteen patients matched for age and severity of coronary artery disease served as a control group and \"usual medical care\" was rendered by their private physicians. No significant changes with respect to serum lipoproteins, physical work capacity, maximal rate-pressure product, or stress-induced myocardial ischemia were observed in this group. These data indicate that regular physical exercise at high intensity, lowered body weight, and normalization of serum lipoproteins may alleviate compromised myocardial perfusion during stress.\r"

Endocarditis after extractions occurred in 89% of control animals and was due to group G streptococci, to Staphylococcus aureus, or to both organisms. A single-dose of amoxicillin or erythromycin successfully prevented endocarditis due to these bacterial species. The analysis of the bacteremia (by culturing blood drawn 1 min after extraction on penicillinase-containing blood agar plates) indicated that amoxicillin did not influence the incidence or the magnitude of circulating group G streptococci and S. aureus, while erythromycin apparently suppressed them. However, when care was taken to eliminate blood erythromycin by a lysis-centrifugation process, the incidence and magnitude of bacteremia after erythromycin prophylaxis was similar to that in control rats. We conclude that single doses of amoxicillin and erythromycin successfully prevent experimental endocarditis after dental extractions. Since this prophylaxis was operative by mechanisms other than the prevention of the circulation of bacteria before seeding the valvular vegetations, it suggests that recommendations for prevention of bacterial endocarditis should not be aimed only at providing adequate antibiotic blood levels to suppress the bacteremia produced by the invasive procedure.\r"

Twenty-seven balloon-expandable grafts were placed in 13 mongrel dogs under anesthesia. A long sheath was introduced over a wire and catheter or dilator into the pulmonary artery or target vein. A collapsed stainless steel expandable mesh stent was placed over the balloon of an angioplasty catheter. The catheter with the mounted stent was advanced through the sheath. The stent expanded to the diameter of the balloon as the balloon was inflated, and remained expanded as the balloon was deflated. The stent was expanded further with a larger balloon in 11 instances. Eleven stents were placed successfully in pulmonary arteries (out of thirteen attempted), and 11 of 14 were installed in tributaries of the precava or postcava. Three inadvertent embolizations of the devices occurred. All three devices that embolized lodged in the pulmonary arteries and did not obstruct flow. Seven dogs were recatheterized at intervals ranging from 56 to 278 days. Twelve stents were patent and nonobstructive, and two were malpositioned, one of which was obstructed. Three animals were killed 2 months (two dogs) and 9 months (one dog) after the implantations. The stents (four in the pulmonary arteries and two in veins) were completely covered with neointima and were patent, without thrombosis. These stents hold promise for definitive dilation of congenital or postoperative vessel stenoses.\r"

  ".W": "Antiarrhythmic activity of amiodarone's desethyl metabolite, which accumulates during oral amiodarone therapy, has been postulated to explain the delayed onset of antiarrhythmic effects during long-term amiodarone therapy. To determine their relative antiarrhythmic efficacy, amiodarone and its desethyl metabolite, desethylamiodarone, were administered to mongrel dogs with ventricular tachycardia 24 hr after ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Cumulative doses of amiodarone, desethylamiodarone, a combination of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone, or the vehicle for drug administration were given at 1 hr intervals. Both amiodarone and desethylamiodarone suppressed ventricular arrhythmias in a dose-dependent fashion. The metabolite, however, was more potent with a 50% effective concentration for suppression of premature ventricular complexes of 1.4 mg/liter compared with 4.6 mg/liter for the parent compound. Plasma and myocardial drug concentrations were similar to those measured during long-term amiodarone therapy in man, with desethylamiodarone producing greater myocardial concentrations than amiodarone for a given plasma concentration. Coadministration of the metabolite along with the parent drug resulted in suppression of arrhythmias at lower doses of amiodarone than when the latter was administered alone, and concentration-response analysis indicated an additive antiarrhythmic effect. These experiments suggest that the accumulation of desethylamiodarone that occurs with long-term oral amiodarone therapy contributes importantly to the antiarrhythmic effects of the drug, and may account for the gradual increase in antiarrhythmic action during the course of amiodarone therapy.\r"

Instrumented conscious dogs were assessed during serial drug-free electrophysiologic studies over 26 +/- 9 days (range 17 to 35 days) after 2 hr occlusion-reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Of the 19 animals studied, 11 continued to have sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias inducible (group I) over this time period. In the eight remaining animals, spontaneous loss in the ability to induce sustained ventricular tachycardia occurred (group II). Myocardial infarct size in group I animals (18 +/- 8%) was significantly greater than that in group II dogs (12.5 +/- 5%; p less than .05). Even in group I animals, time-dependent changes occurred in the number of extrastimuli required to induce ventricular tachycardia and the frequency with which left ventricular stimulation was necessary. A differential pattern of time-dependent changes in electrophysiologic variables was observed when comparing group I and II animals. The conduction time to the infarct zone was prolonged during follow-up in group I animals, while in group II animals this variable was unchanged. Repolarization time recorded in the border zone remained unchanged in group I animals, but it was significantly shortened in group II animals. In addition, ventricular effective refractory period in the infarct zone shortened over time in group I animals but did not change in group II animals. In conclusion, time-dependent changes occur in electrophysiologic variables that are associated with a progressive decrease in propensity to induction of ventricular tachycardia after myocardial infarction. A critical determinant of whether propensity to ventricular tachycardia resolves over time is size of myocardial infarction.\r"

To examine the isolated effects of changing afterload on the movement of acutely ischemic and nonischemic myocardium, seven open-chest, anesthetized dogs were paced from the left atrium at a rate of 100 beats/min after crushing of the sinus node. The pulmonary artery was perfused artificially and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was carefully controlled with a right heart bypass system. Twenty minutes after occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, the peak left ventricular pressure (LVP) was adjusted to three levels (70, 90, and 110 mm Hg) by blood withdrawal or aortic constriction, while the LVEDP was kept constant (8.3 +/- 2.3 mm Hg). Segment length in the ischemic (IZ) and nonischemic zones (NZ) were measured with sonomicrometers and total, isovolumetric, and ejection systolic shortening (% delta L) were calculated. Changes in left ventricular minor-axis diameter were measured with diameter crystals. Increasing the peak LVP increased the LVP both at aortic valve opening and closing. To keep the LVEDP constant as peak LVP was increased, the cardiac output had to be decreased (p less than .0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied the effects of carbicarb in an animal preparation of hypoxic lactic acidosis (HLA). HLA was induced by ventilating dogs with an hypoxic gas mixture (8% O2/92% N2). Dogs with HLA (n = 28) were then treated with 2.5 meq/kg of either NaHCO3 or carbicarb over 1 hr. Measurements were made, after 1 hr of hypoxia and 1 hr of therapy, of: cardiac hemodynamics, blood gases, liver intracellular pH (pHi), oxygen consumption, and regional lactate production. After therapy, the arterial pH rose with carbicarb (7.22 to 7.27, p less than .01), and fell with NaHCO3 (7.18 to 7.13, p less than .01). Mixed venous PCO2 did not change with carbicarb but increased with NaHCO3 (p less than .05). Arterial lactates stabilized with carbicarb but rose with NaHCO3 (by 3.1 mmol/liter, p less than .005). Lactate use by muscle, gut, and liver all improved with carbicarb and decreased with NaHCO3. The liver pHi (normal = 6.99, hypoxia = 6.80) improved with carbicarb (to 6.92), but decreased further with NaHCO3 (to 6.40). Muscle O2 consumption rose with carbicarb, whereas it decreased with NaHCO3. Arterial pressure fell less with carbicarb (-12 vs -46 mm Hg, p less than .006) and the cardiac output was stable with carbicarb but decreased with NaHCO3 (from 143 to 98 ml/kg/min, p less than .004). Stroke volume also improved with carbicarb but there was no change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, suggesting that carbicarb had a beneficial effect on myocardial contractility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The influence of chest compression rate on initial resuscitation success and 24 hr survival after prolonged manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was investigated in 26 morphine-anesthetized dogs (17 to 30 kg). After placement of aortic and right atrial micromanometers and induction of ventricular fibrillation, manual CPR was commenced immediately and continued for 30 min. One group of 13 dogs underwent manual CPR at a compression rate of 60/min, and the other group at a rate of 120/min. The compression durations in the two groups were not significantly different (51.7 +/- 1.8% at 60/min vs 51.6 +/- 1.9% at 120/min). No drugs other than sodium bicarbonate were administered during CPR. A maximum of three attempts was permitted to defibrillate the heart. Successfully defibrillated animals were followed for 24 hr, during which time no treatment, other than naloxone, was given to reverse the effects of morphine. Arterial blood pH, PCO2, and PO2 were not significantly different in the two groups throughout the CPR period. When compared with the compression rate of 60/min, the compression rate of 120/min produced more successfully defibrillated animals (12/13 at 120/min vs 2/13 at 60/min, p less than .002) and more 24 hr survivors (8/13 at 120/min vs 2/13 at 60/min, p less than .03). All 24 hr survivors were conscious and able to sit, stand, and drink normally. One 24 hr survivor in each group had difficulty walking. Improved survival with the high-rate compression technique was consistent with the significantly higher mean aortic (systolic and diastolic) and coronary perfusion pressures attained with high-rate compressions (all p less than .002). Although the clinical applicability of these findings has yet to be demonstrated, they provide empirical support for the recent decision to increase the chest compression rate for manual CPR recommended by the American Heart Association, and indicate that the hemodynamic and survival benefits of faster compression rates in this experimental preparation were not dependent on covariant alterations in compression duration.\r"

Fifteen hearts had myocardial infarction with PIVSD and 39 hearts had infarction without PIVSD and were used as a comparison group. All infarcts were sized histologically and the percent of each ventricle infarcted was quantitated by computer-assisted planimetry. The pathologic substrate for PIVSD was diffuse coronary artery disease with acute thrombosis resulting in transmural confluent infarction. Within the PIVSD group, there was significantly more left ventricle involved in anterior infarctions than in inferior infarctions (p less than .04). Conversely, there was more right ventricular infarction in inferiorly located myocardial infarctions with resulting PIVSD (p = .059). When infarctions resulting in PIVSD were compared with infarctions not resulting in PIVSD, the PIVSD group was characterized by larger left and right ventricular infarcts irrespective of infarct location (p less than .003). The incidence of right ventricular infarction was 100% in the PIVSD group (p less than .0001). Twelve of the 15 patients with PIVSD (80%) developed cardiogenic shock within 48 hr of septal rupture. The high incidence of shock and the rapid deterioration may have been secondary to right ventricular infarction in these patients. Therefore, infarcts resulting in PIVSD and subsequent death are characterized by a high incidence of right ventricular infarction. Significantly more infarction of the right ventricle is seen in either anterior or inferior infarctions resulting in PIVSD compared with infarctions not resulting in PIVSD. PIVSD complicating inferior infarctions is associated with the greatest amount of right ventricular infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Increased vascular constriction has been observed at the site of atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting an association between atherosclerosis and altered vascular tone. While atherosclerosis may increase sensitivity to exogenous vasoconstrictors, little is known about the response of normal and atherosclerotic coronary arteries to an exogenous stimulus that excites the sympathetic nervous system. Therefore, we studied the response to cold pressor test (CPT) using quantitative angiography and Doppler flow velocity measurements in eight patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries (group I), nine patients with mild coronary atherosclerosis (less than 50% diameter narrowing) (group II), and 13 patients with advanced coronary stenoses (greater than 50% diameter narrowing) (group III). In 31 segments of angiographically smooth arteries in group I, the CPT produced vasodilation from a control mean diameter of 2.68 +/- 0.09 (mean +/- SE) to 2.99 +/- 0.09 mm at peak CPT (p less than 0.001), a 12 +/- 1% increase in diameter. In group II, 27 irregular segments constricted to peak CPT from a mean control diameter of 1.82 +/- 0.12 to 1.66 +/- 0.12 mm (p less than .001), a 9 +/- 1% decrease, while 10 smooth segments dilated from a mean control diameter of 1.98 +/- 0.11 mm to 2.34 +/- 0.15 mm (p less than .01), a 19 +/- 2% increase in diameter. Likewise, in group III, the 17 stenotic segments constricted from 1.16 +/- 0.09 to 0.89 +/- 0.09 mm (p less than .001), a 24 +/- 6% decrease; the irregular segments also constricted from 2.44 +/- 0.11 to 2.22 +/- 0.12 mm (p = .002), a 10 +/- 2% decrease. In contrast, two smooth segments dilated from 2.98 to 3.23 mm (mean), an 8% increase in diameter. Coronary blood flow increased 65 +/- 4% (mean) during CPT in group I, it increased 15 +/- 6% in group II, and it decreased 39 +/- 8% in group III. The vasodilator response in four normal patients was partly inhibited by the administration of intracoronary propranolol (17 +/- 3% increase during control, 10 +/- 2% increase after propranolol, 41% less dilation; p = .002). We conclude that the response of normal coronary arteries to the CPT test is dilation, in part related to beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation and possibly flow-mediated endothelial dilation or alpha 2-adrenergic activity. The paradoxical vasoconstrictor response induced by atherosclerosis may represent altered catecholamine sensitivity and/or a defect in endothelial vasodilator function. The presence of atherosclerosis impairs vasodilator responses and thus may contribute to the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia.\r"

There were no significant differences in terms of age, hemoglobin, systemic oxygen saturation, or pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio in the two groups. No patients with atrioventricular valve regurgitation were included. The ventricular cavity volume was calculated by the area-length method. The ventricular mass volume was determined as the shell volume created by subtracting the ventricular cavity volume from the total ventricular volume calculated by adding the free wall thickness to the chamber dimensions. The ventricular mass volume was converted to mass by multiplying by the gravity of the heart muscle. There was no significant difference between patients with the LV type and RV type of single ventricle with respect to the end-diastolic ventricular volume (188 +/- 53 and 179 +/- 61 ml/m2 in LV and RV types, respectively), end-systolic volume (88 +/- 31 and 84 +/- 27 ml/m2), or ejection fraction (0.54 +/- 0.06 and 0.52 +/- 0.06).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Alterations in ventricular loading conditions lead to changes in action potential duration and arrhythmias via contraction-excitation feedback; a decrease in load leads to prolongation of repolarization. To determine whether changes in right ventricular load alter ventricular repolarization in man, the corrected QT interval, a measure of overall ventricular repolarization, was measured in 32 patients before and after valvuloplasty for pulmonary stenosis. Right ventricular systolic pressure decreased (82.5 +/- 30.7 to 40.5 +/- 9.5 mm Hg, p less than .001) and the QTc increased concurrently (409.1 +/- 24.3 to 440.7 +/- 28.0 msec, p less than .001) after successful valvuloplasty. The increase in QTc was most marked for those patients with a greater than 30 mm Hg decrease in right ventricular pressure (40.0 +/- 23.3 vs 16.3 +/- 21.3 msec, p = .006). In a subset of seven patients in whom monophasic action potentials were recorded, monophasic action potential duration, a measure of local repolarization, was prolonged (230.0 +/- 24.3 vs 216.9 +/- 21.9, p less than .001) after successful valvuloplasty, confirming that the QTc prolongation reflected changes in local ventricular repolarization. In addition, during nine acute right ventricular outflow tract occlusions in a subset of six patients, monophasic action potential duration shortened (206.6 +/- 17.6 vs 221.7 +/- 20.9 msec, p less than .01) and early afterdepolarizations developed consistent with contraction-excitation feedback. These data suggest that, in humans, changes in mechanical load are associated with changes in ventricular repolarization consistent with contraction-excitation feedback.\r"

  ".W": "Two Doppler methods, the pressure half-time method proposed by Hatle and the method based on the equation of continuity, were used to estimate stenotic mitral valve area noninvasively, and the accuracy of these methods was examined in patients with and without associated aortic regurgitation. Mitral valve area determined at catheterization by the Gorlin formula was used as a standard of reference. The study population consisted of 41 patients with mitral stenosis, and 20 of the 41 patients had associated aortic regurgitation. According to the equation of continuity, mitral valve area was determined as a product of aortic or pulmonic annular cross-sectional area and the ratio of time velocity integral of aortic or pulmonic flow to that of the mitral stenotic jet. Mitral valve area was determined by the pressure half-time method as 220/pressure half-time, the time from the peak transmitral velocity to one-half the square root of the peak velocity on the continuous-wave Doppler-determined transmitral flow velocity pattern. The pressure half-time method tended to overestimate catheterization measurements, and the correlation coefficient for this relation was .69 (SEE = 0.44 cm2). The correlation coefficient improved to .90 when the patients with associated aortic regurgitation were excluded. Mitral valve areas determined by the continuity equation method correlated well with catheterization measurements at a correlation coefficient of .91 (SEE = 0.24 cm2), irrespective of the presence of aortic regurgitation. The ratio of the time-velocity integral or aortic or pulmonic flow to the time-velocity integral of mitral stenotic jet also correlated well with mitral valve area determined by catheterization at a correlation coefficient of .84 (SEE = 0.10).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the sequential changes of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) after complete revascularization, 43 patients underwent exercise thallium-201 (201Tl) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy before and at 9 +/- 5 days, 3.3 +/- 0.6, and 6.8 +/- 1.2 months after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Only patients with single-vessel CAD, without previous myocardial infarction, and without evidence of restenosis at 6 to 9 months after PTCA were included. Perfusion scans were analyzed blindly with the use of a new quantitative method to define regional myocardial perfusion in the topographic distribution of each coronary artery, which was shown to be reproducible (r = .94 or higher and SEE of 7% or less, between repeated measures by one and two operators). At 4 to 18 days after PTCA, the mean treadmill walking time increased by 123 +/- 42 sec, mean exercise-induced ST segment depression decreased by 0.6 +/- 0.3 mm, group maximal heart rate increased by 20 +/- 9 beats/min, and group systolic blood pressure at peak exercise increased by 24 +/- 10 mm Hg, compared with pre-PTCA values (p less than .001). However, no group differences were noted in these variables between the three post-PTCA stages. Myocardial perfusion in the distribution of the affected (dilated) coronary artery, on the other hand, improved progressively. In the 45 degree left anterior oblique view for instance, myocardial perfusion increased at 9 days after PTCA (from 68 +/- 24% before PTCA to 91 +/- 9%, p less than .001) and at 3.3 months after PTCA (101 +/- 8%, p less than .05 vs 9 days after PTCA), but no further significant changes were seen at 6.8 months after PTCA (102 +/- 8%). Similar changes were noted in the other two views. No relationship between minor complications during PTCA and delayed improvement on the 201Tl was observed. Myocardial ischemia was diagnosed in 12 of the 43 scans recorded a few days after PTCA, but in none recorded at later stages. We conclude that 201Tl scans after PTCA often show delayed improvement and therefore, an abnormal myocardial perfusion scan soon after PTCA does not necessarily reflect residual coronary stenosis or recurrence.\r"

The methods used included four standardized knee scoring scales for subjective, objective, functional, and roentgenographic evaluations, as well as isokinetic and isometric strength evaluations. The outcome in Grade II sprains of the MCL was generally good, even though some residual medial laxity was common. In Grade III sprains the outcome was much worse, with a high frequency of persisting medial instability, dysfunction of the anterior cruciate ligament, muscle weakness, and posttraumatic osteoarthritis of the injured knee. Grade II sprains of the MCL respond acceptably to nonoperative treatment, whereas in Grade III sprains such treatment is not the method of choice.\r"

Five arthroplasties were excluded because of aseptic loosening, but none of these showed malalignment in postoperative roentgenograms. Clinical results and the patients' reports on deterioration of prosthetic function were correlated with positioning of the prosthetic components. Total alignment between 6 degrees of varus and 7 degrees of valgus was associated with good clinical results. Total alignment of more than 7 degrees of valgus, anterior tilting of the tibial component, or positioning of the femoral component in more than 12 degrees of valgus correlated with relatively poor clinical results.\r"

  ".W": "In the past decade, two concepts have caused considerable controversy in orthopedic surgery of the knee. Some orthopedic centers contend that osteotomy of the tibia is the procedure of choice for unicompartmental gonarthrosis of the knee and resist the concept of unicompartmental arthroplasty. The other concept is that if unicompartmental arthroplasty is necessary, the entire joint should be replaced, since the uninvolved compartment may develop arthritis in the future. This concept is illogical and contrary to the basic orthopedic principle of preserving normal structures whenever possible. It is obvious that joint replacements may not last the life of the patient and the need for revision must be considered; therefore, the original procedure should preserve as much bone stock as possible. The purposes of this review of unicompartmental replacement are to resolve these questions with data on long-term results of unicompartmental arthroplasty compared with data on high tibial osteotomy, to evaluate the cause of failures, and to improve future results. Eighty-seven consecutive unicompartmental arthroplasties were performed between November 1972 and April 1976. There were 60 knees available for study, with a minimum ten-year (average, 11-year) follow-up period. The results were evaluated using the Hospital for Special Surgery rating system, with 30 excellent, eight good, four fair, and 18 poor results. Seventy percent of the patients had satisfactory results, and pain relief was accomplished in 86.6% of patients. Of the 21 failures, the majority were due to material or technical problems and improper selection of the patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clinically, the operated foot demonstrated slight thickening beneath the second and third metatarsal heads but no significant abnormal callus formation developed.

The average arc of motion was improved from 63 degrees to 97 degrees. This resulted in 77% good and excellent results. There were five failures (16%), all of which occurred in the revision group. These results compare favorably with results of constrained prostheses; however, the deformity in this group was quite severe. The major indications for use of TCP III would be medial ligament loss, severe valgus or combined deformities, or cases of unstable revision in which a surface arthroplasty will not suffice. The prosthesis should not be used in cases that demonstrate massive bone loss. In those cases, the prosthesis should have a weight-bearing intramedullary stem to transfer stress lines to cortical bone.\r"

Amikacin (19 patients) or netilmicin (2 patients) was delivered locally via a pump implanted subcutaneously. The outflow catheters were led from the pump subcutaneously to the infected area and placed in the defect created by the surgical debridement. The pump was refilled at intervals, on an outpatient basis. The pump was surgically removed at the conclusion of therapy. Follow-up evaluation was for 12-27 months. The duration of hospitalization was five to 52 days (mean, 23 days). The infusions were sustained for 32-140 days (mean, 63 days). Systemic levels of antibiotics were always below acceptable trough levels. Levels in the wound drainage of the 11 patients who drained after operation were always greater than the upper limit of the assay. Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were determined using pre- and posttherapy creatinine clearances and audiograms. Two patients exhibited minimal nephrotoxicity (creatinine clearance of 66 ml/minute and 55 ml/minute; normal, 70 ml/minute). There were no other adverse effects of the antibiotics. Sixteen patients have not drained since removal of the pumps.\r"

All uncomplicated low-velocity gunshot fractures, less than 615 m/second, (2000 feet/second), can be managed conservatively, with superficial debridement, surgical cleansing, immobilization, and antibiotics. Seventeen orthopedic procedures were performed; specific treatment was dictated by the type or location of the fracture caused by the missile. One hundred thirty-two fractures were treated with antibiotic therapy, 80 intravenously and 52 oral administration. Only two infections were encountered, both in the oral therapy group. No statistically significant advantage of intravenous over oral administration was found. Emergency room debridement along with oral antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated low-velocity gunshot fractures not requiring operative fixation yielded results comparable to those of hospitalization, with dramatically reduced medical costs.\r"

Preoperative diagnoses included five feet with degenerative arthritis secondary to a calcaneal fracture, four feet with a talocalcaneal bar, one foot with a degenerative subtalar arthropathy of unknown cause, and one foot with an unstable subtalar joint secondary to a peroneal tendon rupture. The average follow-up period was 41.5 months (range, 23-103 months). The hindfoot was fused in a average of 6 degrees of valgus. The feet maintained approximately 50% of their transverse tarsal motion, compared with the contralateral side. No foot developed hypermobility of any tarsal joint. Three feet fused for degenerative joint disease developed very mild talar beaking, and two feet fused for a tarsal coalition developed a mild progression or increase in talar beaking. Three feet demonstrated very minimal osteophyte formation at the calcaneocuboid joint. Functional and pain ratings for patients who had fusions for talocalcaneal bars or degenerative joint disease were good to excellent. Minimal radiographic changes at the talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints secondary to increased stress brought about by the fusion did not seem to be clinically significant. Isolated subtalar fusion for lesions limited to the subtalar joint, which includes talocalcaneal bars, is a satisfactory method of treatment.\r"

The patients were followed for 12-57 months (average, 29 months). There was no evidence of residual infection at follow-up examination in any case. Applying the Hospital for Special Surgery knee rating system, 12 patients (50%) were rated excellent, six patients (25%) good, two patients (9%) fair, and four patients (6%) poor. Of the six patients with fair and poor results, five had reduced scores due to joint problems unrelated to the infected TKA. Fourteen patients had no pain at follow-up examination, and four had only slight pain. Nine patients had no limp, ten had a slight limp, one had a moderate limp, and the remainder either had a severe limp or were bedridden due to other joint problems. Eight patients could walk an unlimited distance and four could walk at least one-half mile. Twenty-one knees had a range of flexion greater than 90 degrees. Three patients had extensor lags of 20 degrees or greater. Only one patient required bracing for ambulation.\r"

Ten skeletally mature mongrel dogs (20 femora) were divided into three groups: Group I, controls; Group II, LN (with and without bone graft); and Group III, PMMA (with and without LN). Roentgenograms, whole-mount histology, and tetracycline fluorescence studies were performed on the distal femur. Correlation of these studies showed that (1) marked trabecular and bone necrosis, extending 7-12 mm around the circumference of the cavity, developed by three and seven weeks after LN but no bony necrosis occurred after PMMA; (2) the pattern of reossification following cryosurgery was delayed and abnormal, demonstrating increased calcification and metaplastic bone formation; (3) cryosurgery decreased the rate of bone graft incorporation; (4) the cryonecrotic rim following cryosurgery correlated with an abortive attempt at peripheral reossification; and (5) cryosurgery had no effect on the articular cartilage. Cryosurgery is effective in causing bone necrosis, whereas PMMA is not, and the pattern of reossification is delayed and altered by freezing. This study suggests that microvascular thrombosis with subsequent ischemic infarction of bone is a major cause of bone necrosis following cryosurgery.\r"

The diagnoses were similar in both groups, with osteoarthritis in 167 knees, rheumatoid arthritis in 34 knees, osteonecrosis in four knees, traumatic arthritis in four knees, and psoriatic arthritis in one knee. Average flexion at hospital discharge was 87.7 degrees in the control group and 90.2 degrees in the CPM group (p less than 0.02). Seventy-four percent of the CPM group and 60% of the control group had achieved 90 degrees of flexion by the time of hospital discharge. The number of days to achieve 90 degrees averaged 10.3 in the control group and 7.7 in the CPM group (p less than 0.001). There was no significant difference in flexion at two or three months or at one year after operation between the two groups. Five knees in the control group and one in the CPM group required manipulation. The duration of hospitalization was not significantly different between the two groups. Hemoglobin levels, operative blood loss, and transfusion requirements were not significantly different. Patients with CPM following TKA achieve motion earlier than those without CPM, but ultimate motion and complications are not affected.\r"

Following implantation the test sample was loaded eccentrically over the medial tibial plateau at 40 cycles per minute for 300,000 cycles, using an MTS machine. This represents the number of steps taken by the average person in a six- to 12-month period. Load varied sinusoidally from 5 to 115 kg. Subsidence and lift-off of the tibial plate from its bony bed was recorded for each implant, using linear variable differential transformers. The greatest degree of mechanical stability was observed with the AMK design, which is secured to the bone bed using four peripherally placed 6.5-mm cancellous screws. No motion in excess of 100 micron was observed. The central-stemmed Whiteside design and the cortical screw fixated Miller-Galante designs provided slightly less stability, each demonstrating approximately 200 micron of lift-off on the unweighted side. The PCA design exhibited the greatest amount of micromotion with subsidence and lift-off displacements of 500 micron (0.5 mm).\r"

The end point of the survivorship was defined as: (1) the need for revision due to septic or aseptic loosening; (2) roentgenographic loosening evidenced by a shift of component position; or (3) radiolucency extending under the condyle of the tibial component and partially along the peg, when associated with clinical symptoms. Life table calculations predict 88.7% survivorship of total condylar knee arthroplasty. Using revision for septic or aseptic loosening and recommendation for surgery as an end point, the survivorship was 94.1% 11 years after operation in this series. Seventy-two patients (90 knees) of 87 were available for clinical and roentgenographic study at eight to 11 years. Eight patients (12 knees) had died and seven patients (ten knees) were lost to follow-up study. The results were excellent to good in 93%, fair in 3%, and poor in 4%. Roentgenographic evaluation revealed well-fixed components in 36 knees (40%). Radiolucencies of varying degrees were present in 54 knees (60%). Of the 54 knees, seven had radiolucency under the tibial condyle in Zones I-IV and partially along the peg in Zones V and VI. Two knees had component loosening, one with a loose patella and the other a loose tibial component; both of these patients were symptomatic. Variables such as the patient's age, sex, diagnosis, alignment and position of the prosthesis, and level of bone cut did not correlate with the development of radiolucencies at the cement-bone interface.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, 43 percent of ICH victims had hemorrhages of the type associated with periventricular bleeding in preterm newborns. Of multiple obstetric and neonatal factors analyzed, many of which are identified risk factors for periventricular hemorrhage, only thrombocytopenia (p = 0.02) was significantly associated with ICH. We conclude that the risk of ICH in newborns with PPH is significant and warrants consideration by clinicians caring for this population. Risk factors (except thrombocytopenia) previously implicated in other types of neonatal ICH, particularly periventricular hemorrhage, do not significantly correlate with ICH in infants with PPH.\r"

In four, neurologic outcome was indeterminate because of early death. Thus, evaluation of this population of infants with BPD has established two syndromes of neurologic disease--progressive and nonprogressive. The patients with nonprogressive neurologic disease exhibited static neurologic deficits identical to those described in earlier reports of outcome in infants with BPD. The infants with apparently progressive neurologic disease had clinical courses comparable to the fatal pattern of cerebral deterioration previously described. The syndromes appear to be distinct in etiology and clinical presentation. Intraventricular hemorrhage complicated by hemorrhagic intracerebral involvement appears the factor most clearly associated with nonprogressive neurologic disease. The etiology of the striking progressive neurologic syndrome could not be so clearly established but appears to be related to the course and treatment of BPD.\r"

In a randomized order, each subject was given 24 micrograms/kg nifedipine, 40 micrograms/kg nitrendipine, or 10 micrograms/kg nisoldipine intravenously. The three DHPs differed as to their total clearance and volume of distribution (nifedipine less than nisoldipine less than nitrendipine) but showed similar values for elimination half-lives. All three drugs evoked increases in heart rate and forearm blood flow (FBF) and small decreases in blood pressure. Whereas the observed peak changes in heart rate were virtually identical for the three drugs (about 45% above baseline), the peak changes in FBF were more pronounced in response to nitrendipine and nisoldipine (greater than 200% above baseline) than in response to nifedipine (79% above baseline). The heart rate and FBF responses to the DHPs were related directly to the drug concentrations in plasma. The plasma level-response curves obeyed Hill's equation. They showed that the DHPs differ mainly in their potencies at dilating the forearm resistance vessels (nifedipine less than nitrendipine less than nisoldipine).\r"

Pulse rate, mean arterial blood pressure, plasma norepinephrine, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, and growth hormone were measured. Clorgiline treatment (2.5 to 10 mg/day) produced a variable reduction in the hypotensive response to clonidine but did not influence heart rate or plasma norepinephrine responses. Clorgiline markedly reduced the urinary output of norepinephrine and metabolites, indicating a reduced turnover of norepinephrine. None of the measured parameters corresponded with clinical effect. These data suggest that any clorgiline-induced alterations in alpha 2-receptor function as measured by responses to clonidine are modest and highly variable. Furthermore, since the variable and inconsistent changes in alpha 2-receptor function are dissociated from the massive changes in norepinephrine metabolism, regulation of presynaptic alpha 2-receptors appears unlikely to mediate the effects of clorgiline in patients with depression.\r"

Oral nisoldipine, 20 mg, or placebo was followed 1 hour later by propranolol, 40 mg, or placebo using a randomized, crossover, double-blind design. Nisoldipine significantly increased the AUC (+43%) and peak plasma drug concentration (Cmax) (+68%) of propranolol resulting in a higher degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade (as assessed by isoproterenol). Conversely, nisoldipine's AUC (+30%) and Cmax (+57%) were increased with concomitant administration of propranolol. Nisoldipine did not affect blood pressure but caused significant decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR) and increases in plasma catecholamines and cardiac index. Forearm vascular resistance and blood flow changed more markedly than did TPR and cardiac index. In contrast, propranolol had little effect on forearm hemodynamics despite significant decreases in cardiac index and increases in TPR. The data are compatible with changes in hepatic blood flow, accounting for the pharmacokinetic interaction of nisoldipine and propranolol. Different vascular beds appear to contribute to the effects of nisoldipine vs. propranolol on peripheral resistance.\r"

At the initiation of therapy, nitrendipine caused an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow in the hypertensive, but not in the normal, group. Percentage excretion rates of sodium (%ENa) and phosphate (%EPi) and free water clearance (CW) increased in both groups at the initiation of therapy. After 2 weeks of nitrendipine therapy repeat acute clearance studies showed that the drug no longer increased glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow in hypertensive subjects, the increases in %ENa and CW persisted in normal subjects and trended upward in hypertensive subjects, and the increase in %EPi persisted in both normal and hypertensive individuals. We conclude that nitrendipine is not sodium retentive after chronic therapy and the acute increase in %ENa, %EPi, and CW after its initial administration suggests a proximal tubular effect.\r"

Plasma and urine drug and metabolite concentrations were determined by sensitive and specific RIA procedures. Pharmacodynamics were assessed by pupillometry and vital sign determinations. Codeine elimination half-life and mean residence time were increased significantly in the hemodialysis group (18.69 +/- 9.03 hours and 12.77 +/- 7.09 hours, mean +/- SD, respectively) compared with the healthy volunteer group (4.04 +/- 0.60 hours and 3.90 +/- 0.52 hours, respectively). The total body clearance and volume of distribution of codeine were not significantly different between groups. Peak concentrations, times to peak concentrations, and AUCs for the three metabolites were also not significantly different between the groups, in part as a result of significant interpatient variability in the hemodialysis group. Examination of pupillometry and vital sign data did not reveal clinically significant differences in pharmacodynamics between the groups. Adjustment of dosage regimen may be required in some patients with uremia receiving multiple-dose codeine therapy.\r"

Active disease is commonly associated with hypoalbuminemia: 30 +/- 4 gm/L vs. 41 +/- 2 gm/L (mean +/- SD) at the time of improvement. Total naproxen concentrations were significantly lower in active disease, together with a larger apparent volume of distribution (10.6 +/- 1.8 L vs. 8.4 +/- 1.3 L; P less than 0.05) and total body clearance (0.79 +/- 1.8 L/hr vs. 0.59 +/- 0.14 L/hr; P less than 0.001). Peak unbound naproxen concentrations were 29% +/- 19% (P less than 0.05) lower at the time of improvement. The unbound clearance was found diminished during active disease (390 +/- 277 L/hr) in comparison with improvement (488 +/- 343 L/hr; P less than 0.05). Clinical implications of the alterations in naproxen kinetics induced by polyarticular inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are discussed.\r"

With increasing concentration of N2O, there was prolongation of P-300 latency and worsening of Continuous Performance Test and Symbol Digit Test performance; P-300 amplitude and Finger Tapping Test performance were decreased by exposure to N2O.

Our subjects, one-third of whom were premenopausal, comprised approximately 12 percent of the total OSAS population seen. Women with OSAS were compared with 110 OSAS men and with a group of 16 women without OSAS but referred to orthodontists for mild dental malocclusion. Women with OSAS were massively obese, much more so than their male counterparts. There was no significant difference between pre- and postmenopausal women, with the exception of the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), which was lower in the postmenopausal group despite similar morbid obesity (seemingly better tolerated by women with OSAS than by men with the same syndrome) and long mandibular plane-hyoid bone distance. The significantly higher RDI noted in premenopausal women, despite equally massive obesity and upper airway abnormalities, is thought to be related to hormonal status and better arousal response. Chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) seen in a subgroup of women with OSAS did not differentiate this subgroup from the other OSAS patients when oxygen saturation during sleep, frequency of abnormal respiratory events and sleep variables were considered. Massive obesity is the dominant factor for the appearance of OSAS in women.\r"

Eight patients had a largely reversible lung disease associated with drug treatment (gold, D-penicillamine or nitrofurantoin.) The remaining 49 had interstitial fibrosis of unknown cause. Causes for hospitalization were respiratory and general symptoms in 38, but infiltrations on routine chest roentgenographic examinations alone in eleven patients. Forty-five out of the 49 patients had crackles on auscultation. The most typical findings in lung function tests were restriction and a decreased diffusion capacity.

Such paradoxic motion was consistently associated with overestimation of volumetric data by RIP compared to pneumotachygraphic measurements. With onset of lower rib cage paradox, the mean error of RIP-derived VT measurements increased from 9.1 +/- 1.7 to 27.9 +/- 3.8 percent (p less than .001). Flow measurements derived from RIP were also inaccurate in the presence of lower rib cage paradox, with the mean error of the measurement increasing from 9.0 +/- 2.5 to 33.5 +/- 5.3 percent (p less than .001).

Restricting the analysis to painters, and controlling for smoking, we observed a significant relationship between years of exposure to paint products and airflow obstruction. Painters may be at risk for developing airflow obstruction and these changes appear to be related to the duration of exposure to paint products. Painters who smoke may be at risk of developing this obstructive process earlier than nonsmokers.\r"

Aside from the first cigarette, smoking did not significantly alter blood pressure or heart rate.

Discontinuities and clefts were observed at the level of cellular junctions; absorption of high weight molecules and cells from the pleural space may be facilitated at this level, but the structures which were observed in humans may not be considered \"stomata,\" according to the definition of such morphologic units as we give in the present study. Cilia and blebs, described in the experimental animal or in other mesothelia, were not seen in the human pleura.\r"

Respiratory syndromes induced by this exposure included an acute sensitizing illness with dyspnea and wheezing in some workers and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia in others. Another worker developed chronic obstruction of the airways with recurrent bronchitic illnesses. Mild to marked peripheral eosinophilia, up to 3,000/cu mm, was usually present in the symptomatic workers and in 11 of 30 asymptomatic workers. These cases illustrate the diversity of respiratory illnesses which may result from a common workplace exposure and reinforce the importance of considering occupational exposures in the differential diagnosis of peripheral eosinophilia.\r"

Survival, estimated by the actuarial method, was 54 percent at one year from first symptoms and 39 percent from histologic diagnosis. No subject was alive four years after diagnosis. Histologic type and asbestos exposure had no predictive value in our series. Survival was longer in patients under 60 years of age and when mesothelioma originated on the left side. Overall, treated patients had significantly longer survival than untreated patients. However, there was no significant difference in survival with respect to the type of treatment given: surgery, chemotherapy, talc poudrage or their combination.\r"

  ".W": "The effect on pulmonary fluid balance of adrenergic receptor agonist agents commonly employed in clinical sepsis has not been well characterized. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that dobutamine would increase pulmonary microvasular fluid flux in experimental sepsis-induced lung injury. To define the effects of this synthetic catecholamine on pulmonary lymph flow (QL), we infused dobutamine in sheep at two doses in sequence (5 micrograms/kg/min and 10 micrograms/kg/min) before and after the induction of intraperitoneal sepsis which resulted in the development of lung microvascular injury. In the nonseptic state, cardiac output increased at both 5 micrograms/kg/min and 10 micrograms/kg/min (22 and 36 percent, respectively), while QL was unchanged from baseline (for 5 micrograms, delta QL = +0.44 +/- 1.35 ml/15 min; not significant) (for 10 micrograms, delta QL = -0.20 +/- 1.0 ml/15 min; not significant). Values for the ratio of lymph/plasma total protein levels [( L/P]TP) fell modestly in the nonseptic study at both doses (p less than 0.05). With established sepsis syndrome, QL increased from the nonseptic baseline study (2.99 +/- 1.8 to 7.01 +/- 3.95 ml/15 min; p less than 0.05), without change in [L/P]TP ratios or the calculated microvascular hydrostatic pressure. (Pmv) During sepsis, dobutamine infusion was again associated with an increase in cardiac output at both the 5 micrograms/kg/min (+29 percent) and 10 micrograms/kg/min (+33 percent) doses, while QL increased modestly only with the lower dose of dobutamine infused (5 micrograms/kg/min, delta QL = 1.80 +/- 2.2 ml/15 min; p less than 0.05). In this model of sepsis-induced lung injury, dobutamine increased systemic flow without substantially augmenting QL.\r"

Heart rate, blood pressure, and measured ventilatory parameters were assessed at a standard submaximal workload (3.0 mph/0% grade), the gas exchange anaerobic threshold (ATge), and maximal exercise. Significant reductions in heart rate at all stages of exercise were demonstrated: maximum heart rate decreased from 171 +/- 30 beats/min to 142 +/- 27 beats/min (17 percent, p less than .01) and submaximal exercise heart rate decreased from 123 +/- 22 beats/min to 96 +/- 16 beats/min (22 percent, p less than .01). However, there were no significant changes in blood pressure or gas exchange data, ie, oxygen uptake, minute ventilation, or respiratory exchange ratio at any of the exercise workloads. These data demonstrate that in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, diltiazem controls the ventricular rate response throughout exercise without attenuating blood pressure or exercise capacity.\r"

We describe a patient with AIDS-related complex who presented with symptoms and radiographic evidence of micronodular interstitial lung disease. Transbronchial biopsy revealed a lymphocytic bronchiolitis but no evidence of interstitial lung disease and a marked T-suppressor lymphocytosis was found on analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen.

Although administration of large doses of morphine has been shown to significantly decrease EE, the influence on EE of morphine given in routine amounts to critically ill patients has not been studied previously. We examined the effect of morphine administration (given as bolus IV injections of 0.10 mg/kg every two hours and continuous IV infusion at 0.05 mg/kg/hr) on EE during rest and various ICU activities in seven mechanically ventilated patients. Morphine administration resulted in a significant reduction in resting EE and total EE of 6.0 and 8.6 percent, respectively. However, EE associated with activities (ie, chest x-ray examination and chest physiotherapy) were not significantly affected by morphine administration. Both bolus and continuous IV morphine infusion had similar effects on EE. Administration of routine doses of morphine significantly decreases total EE in critically ill patients. This should be considered an important factor influencing measurements of EE.\r"

FVC, FEV1, and PaO2 were significantly smaller, and PaCO2 was significantly larger in nonsurvivors than those in survivors. After orciprenaline sulfate (10 mg in 0.5 ml solution) inhalation, VC and FEV1 increased in comparable amount between the two groups. Airway reversibility as estimated by percentage changes in FEV1 before and after the bronchodilator (reversibility index) was similar between the two groups. In the 16 nonsurvivors, hypoxemic patients had similar FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and reversibility indices as normoxemic patients. These results indicate that not airway reversibility per se but a fixed or irreversible component of airway obstruction is one of the determinants of the prognosis in pulmonary emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Chronic hypoxemia is related to neither airway obstruction nor its reversibility, while it does influence the prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "We performed YAG laser photoresection in 11 patients with tracheal or mainstem bronchial obstruction due to malignant or benign disorders. We used maximal inspiratory-expiratory flow-volume loops and expiratory volume-time plots to assess air flow limitation. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF) and iso-volume maximal flows at 50 percent of forced inspiratory and expiratory volume were calculated. Spirograms and flow-volume loops were repeated within 12 to 72 hours of laser resection. All patients had flattened expiratory limbs on their flow-volume loops. All spirometric parameters increased significantly following laser photoresection. In particular, peak flow improved in all patients, and FEV1 improved in nine of 11 patients, even though four patients had moderate to severe obstructive ventilatory defects which persisted after resection and were probably due to longstanding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We conclude that flow-volume loops and spirometry are helpful in assessing the site and nature of malignant large airway obstructive processes and, moreover, provide reliable information for evaluating the efficacy of laser photoresection. Serial physiologic studies indicate changes in the caliber of the upper airways and can be used as a simple means of following these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The need for fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the patient with hemoptysis and a normal or nonlocalizing chest roentgenogram remains a subject of debate. Currently, diagnostic fiberoptic bronchoscopy is recommended as the investigative procedure of choice. To develop predictors that identify the patient in whom fiberoptic bronchoscopy is most likely to be diagnostic, we reviewed our community's experience with this population over a five-year period. We identified 196 patients with hemoptysis and a normal or nonlocalizing chest roentgenogram who underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Three quarters were active or previous smokers. We examined the relationship of advancing age, sex, smoking, nonspecific roentgenographic findings and the amount, duration, and previous bouts of hemoptysis to the incidence of a diagnostic fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Twelve patients (6 percent) had bronchogenic carcinoma and 33 (17 percent) another specific cause for the hemoptysis identified by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. By univariate and discriminant analyses, we found that the three factors of age of 50 years or more, male sex, and smoking of 40 pack-years or more best predicted a diagnosis of malignancy. Bleeding in excess of 30 ml daily was associated with an increase in overall diagnostic yield. The presence of two of the three factors associated with malignancy or bleeding in excess of 30 ml daily (or both) identified 100 percent of the patients with bronchogenic carcinoma and 82 percent of all of the diagnostic fiberoptic bronchoscopic procedures. use of these criteria in selecting the patient for fiberoptic bronchoscopy could have reduced our use of the bronchoscope by 28 percent, with the remaining patients safely observed.\r"

To develop better guidelines for travel by patients with cardiopulmonary disease, we measured inflight cabin altitude on 204 regularly scheduled commercial aircraft flights. Measurements were carried out on 16 different types of aircraft, operated by 28 airlines. The median altitude exposure for all flights was 6,214 feet (1894 m). Cabin altitudes ranged from sea level to 8,915 feet (2717 m). Inspired partial pressure of oxygen falls from 159 mm Hg at sea level to 127 mm Hg at 6,200 feet and further declines to 113 mm Hg at 9,000 ft. There was no significant difference between domestic and international flights. New generation aircraft fly at higher altitudes than older aircraft and are associated with greater altitude exposures to passengers (p = 0.002). The risk of hypoxemia may increase as newer model aircraft replace older ones.\r"

One patient died of complications of sepsis, and one underwent cardiac transplantation. Programmed electrical stimulation (PES) resulted in five or more beats of induced ventricular tachycardia in seven patients (33 percent), but was a poor predictor of sudden death (sensitivity = 20 percent). Thirteen patients (62 percent) had complex ventricular ectopy (Lown class 4A or 4B) by ambulatory monitoring. This was a sensitive (80 percent) but not specific (31 percent) marker for sudden death. The predictive value of a negative Holter monitor study was high (80 percent) for identifying those at low risk of sudden death. The results of this prospective study suggest that programmed ventricular stimulation and routine ambulatory monitoring are poor predictors of sudden death in this population.\r"

There was geographic clustering of the cases: 14 of the 33 (42 percent) lived or worked in four buildings located side by side in the center of town. A case control study revealed that 25 of 29 cases were exposed to a cat that gave birth to stillborn kittens on June 8, 1985 and had bled per vaginum for three weeks prior to delivery. The cat lived in one of the buildings where geographic clustering occurred and frequently visited the other buildings. None of the 40 control subjects was so exposed (p less than 0.001). This cat had an antibody titer of 1:512 to Coxiella burnetii phase 1 antigen and a titer of 1:1024 to phase 2 antigen. Exposure to cattle, sheep and goats, the traditional reservoirs of Q fever, was uncommon among patients and control subjects and none of eight cattle tested had antibodies to C burnetii phase I antigen. We conclude that the infected parturient cat was probably responsible for this outbreak of Q fever affecting 2.8 percent of the population of the town of Baddeck.\r"

Colchicine binding to these two tubulin pools was time dependent and dose responsive. Scatchard analysis of the binding revealed that [3H]colchicine bound to both fractions with similar affinity. After establishing the optimal conditions for the binding assay, the effect of suckling on the relative levels of the two tubulin pools was studied. Groups of primiparous rats on days 12-14 postpartum were isolated from their pups for 4-5 h, then suckled for 30, 60, and 90 min, and killed, and the anterior pituitary lobes were dissected out. Each pituitary lobe was processed to obtain the two tubulin pools, viz. soluble and polymerized tubulin fractions. Suckling for 30 min resulted in an increase in soluble tubulin levels and a concomitant decrease in the polymerized pools. At 60 and 90 min, the soluble tubulin levels gradually decreased to presuckled levels, whereas the polymerized pools increased from the 30-min levels to those observed at 0 min. In another experiment, suckling for 10 min resulted in a decrease in the soluble tubulin levels and a corresponding increase in the polymerized tubulin pool. Treatment of nonsuckled rats with domperidone for 10 min also resulted in a shift of the equilibrium between the two tubulin pools similar to that observed at 10 min of suckling. Administration of bromocriptine 30 min beforehand to nonsuckled rats and then suckling them for 10 min blocked the suckling-induced rise in the polymerized tubulin levels. These results suggest a regulatory role for dopamine in the suckling-induced shift in the equilibrium between the soluble and polymerized tubulin pools in the anterior pituitary lobe.\r"

  ".W": "A high efficiency procedure for the purification to homogeneity of an ovine fetal somatomedin is described. Fetal sheep serum was used as the source material, and activity was followed throughout purification by an insulin-like growth factor (IGF) II RRA. IGF-II-like activity was initially enriched through binding at acid pH to a column of SP-Sephadex C-25 and elution with a neutral pH high-salt buffer. Further chromatography on SP-Sephadex resulted in a preparation containing less than 0.1% of the original serum protein content, but retaining much of the IGF-II-like activity. This enriched fetal IGF preparation was then purified to homogeneity using reverse phase HPLC. However, chromatography on an HPLC gel filtration column was found to be essential to ensure the stability of the purified peptide during storage, although this procedure did not result in any apparent increase in purification. The final yield of purified ovine fetal IGF was 80 micrograms from 400 ml fetal sheep serum. Only one polypeptide chain was detected during amino-terminal sequencing of the fetal somatomedin, and the preparation gave a single band on both gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing, indicating that the peptide was essentially pure. The sequence (eight amino acid residues) was identical to the equivalent sequence in IGF-II from human, rat, and bovine sources. In additional, amino acid analysis of the ovine fetal IGF showed close similarity to the amino acid content of IGF-II from other species. The mol wt of the purified peptide, estimated by HPLC gel filtration, was approximately 7000, close to that of previously purified somatomedins, and the isoelectric point, obtained by chromatofocusing, was around pH 6.8. Thus, the purified ovine fetal somatomedin appears to be similar to IGF-II from other species, and may be the ovine homolog of human IGF-II.\r"

In contrast, dorsolateral prostate AMDC and ODC transcript content in these individuals was age invariant. The differential effect of aging on tissue transcript levels reflected respective 3.5- and 5-fold decreases in ventral prostate total and poly(A)+ RNA content in aging males, whereas dorsolateral prostate RNA levels essentially were age invariant. Testosterone injection of 26-month-old males increased ventral and dorsolateral prostate content of AMDC and ODC transcripts 4- and 2.5-fold, respectively. Changes in ventral prostate ODC transcript levels correlated well with previously reported age- and testosterone-mediated changes in prostate ODC protein content; however, the relation between ventral or dorsolateral prostate AMDC mRNA levels and previously determined AMDC protein content was less stringent. Our observation that ventral prostate ODC transcript content was 7-fold greater than that of dorsolateral prostate was insufficient to account for the established 200-fold difference in ODC activity in these tissues. Our data imply that transcript content is a principal determinant of ventral prostate ODC activity in aging AXC/SSh rats. However, this relationship does not appear to characterize either ventral or dorsolateral prostate AMDC activity or relative ventral and dorsolateral prostate ODC activity and transcript content. The cause of the age-related preferential loss of ventral prostate RNA remains to be evaluated.\r"

  ".U": "88082430\r", 
  ".W": "In previous studies we have demonstrated that bovine TSH (bTSH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) independently stimulate both the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA and replication in quiescent FRTL5 cells. In the case of TSH, evidence was presented that these responses are cAMP mediated. In addition, responses of thymidine incorporation are greatly amplified when particular concentrations of the two agents are added together, but this effect diminishes as the concentration of either bTSH or IGF-I is increased. The present experiments were undertaken to obtain further information concerning the mechanism of the independent mitogenic effects of bTSH and IGF-I and to explore the nature of the biphasic synergistic interaction with respect to thymidine incorporation that occurs when bTSH and IGF-I are added together. Verification that the increases in [3H] thymidine incorporation induced by bTSH and IGF-I, alone and together, are truly reflective of increases in DNA synthesis was obtained in experiments in which labeled nuclei were counted in cultures of cells grown in the presence of one or both mitogenic agents to which [3H]thymidine had been added. In these studies the number of cells with labeled nuclei was increased markedly by each of the two agents, and the response when the two mitogens were added together was far greater than the sum of their individual effects. Over a range of concentrations which included those that elicit a mitogenic response in FRTL5 cells, IGF-I, unlike bTSH, failed to increase cAMP generation when added alone. Moreover, IGF-I did not significantly enhance the cAMP response to varying concentrations of bTSH. A concentration-dependent increase in the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was induced by culturing cells in the presence of the cAMP analog (Bu)2cAMP (Bt2cAMP), the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine, and the stimulator of adenylate cyclase forskolin. When increasing concentrations of these agents were added together with IGF-I, a biphasic pattern of response of DNA synthesis, mimicking that produced by the combination of IGF-I and increasing concentrations of bTSH, was observed. Further evidence that cAMP mediates the mitogenic response to bTSH was the observation that adenosine inhibited the stimulation of both cAMP generation and DNA synthesis that bTSH produced. Although preincubation of quiescent FRTL5 cells for 24 h in the presence of bTSH resulted in only a small increase in DNA synthesis, measured during the last 3 h of a subsequent 24-h incubation carried out in the absence of bTSH, it greatly amplified the response to IGF-I added alone during the second incubation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although regulatory effects on their own receptors are among the major responses to peptide hormones and growth factors, little is known of the mechanism of these effects. For example, a wealth of evidence indicates that cAMP is the mediator of many, if not most, of the actions of TSH on the growth and function of the thyroid cell, but evidently no information has been available concerning the possibility that cAMP may also mediate the effect of TSH to down-regulate its own receptors. Therefore, we examined this question using FRTL5 cells as a model, since we had previously shown that withdrawal of TSH from their culture medium and its subsequent readdition lead to increases and decreases, respectively, in the number of their TSH receptors. Because the growth of FRTL5 cells in response to TSH is modified by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), we also examined the independent effect of TSH on receptors for IGF-I, the effects of IGF-I alone on both its own receptors and those for TSH, the effects of the two agents when added together, and the role of cAMP in the independent and conjoint effects of TSH and IGF-I on their own and each other's receptors. Growth of FRTL5 cells in the presence of bovine TSH (bTSH) resulted in a dose-dependent down-regulation of receptors for both bTSH and IGF-I. In contrast, IGF-I alone produced only a modest down-regulation of its own receptors and had no effect on the binding of bTSH. IGF-I did, however, enhance the effect of bTSH on the binding of both ligands. All of the foregoing down-regulatory effects of bTSH, acting both alone and together with IGF-I, were closely mimicked when either (Bu)2cAMP or forskolin was substituted for bTSH. Therefore, cAMP appears to mediate, at least in part, the effects of both bTSH alone and bTSH acting in concert with IGF-I to down-regulate receptors for both mitogens.\r"

The hepatotoxicity was detectable clinically by hyperbilirubinemia and confirmed histologically by the presence of hepatic degenerative-regenerative changes. Administration of tamoxifen with estrogen [either ethynyl estradiol or diethylstilbestrol (DES)] completely abrogated the hepatotoxic effects, suggesting that estrogen receptor (ER) was necessary for estrogen to damage liver. In Armenian hamsters, estrogens decreased hepatic synthesis of female protein (FP); tamoxifen also abolished this DES effect and resulted in a net increase in serum FP levels. DES administration produced higher serum bilirubin levels and lower serum FP levels in females than in males. Paradoxically, tamoxifen blocked these DES effects more effectively and efficiently in females than in males. Estrogens did not injure uteri of Armenian and Chinese hamsters and were nontoxic to livers of other hamsters species, such as Syrian and Turkish. This model provides another perspective of the acute cellular derangement that can be effected by estrogen-ER complex and may indicate a yet unknown mode of ER action.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that estradiol indirectly stimulated the proliferation of oviduct epithelial cells in the quail. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of estradiol and other steroid hormones on the cAMP concentration. The ability of forskolin, a specific activator of the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase, to induce oviduct cell proliferation and specific protein synthesis (progesterone receptor) in the absence of estrogen was also tested. Administration of estradiol benzoate (EB) to immature female quails produced a transient surge in oviduct cAMP concentration. After EB injection, cAMP concentration increased by 36.7% after 6 h and returned to control values after 12 h. This rise in oviduct cAMP concentration preceded the beginning of DNA synthesis. The same effect was observed even in the absence of increased plasma estradiol, when the hormone was perfused through the hepatic portal vein. Estriol, estrone, and testosterone failed to elevate cAMP concentrations. After repeated EB injections, the oviduct cAMP concentration declined below the control value (-66% after 72 h). A similar drop in the cAMP concentration was observed in developing quails during the proliferative phase of the luminal epithelial and glandular cells. Administration of forskolin to immature female quail pretreated with EB rapidly increased the oviduct cAMP concentration, induced a burst of DNA synthesis, and shortened the prereplicative period. In addition, forskolin administration did not increase the progesterone receptor concentration. These results demonstrate that cAMP is involved in the mechanism by which estradiol indirectly stimulates oviduct epithelial cell proliferation in the quail. The events that may take place during the prereplicative period and the antiproliferative effect of progesterone through a sustained increase in the cAMP concentration in the oviduct are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "A previous study has shown that cAMP was involved in estrogen-activated growth in the quail oviduct. The present study was undertaken to investigate the hormonal regulation of 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity in the oviduct. Tamoxifen, an antiestrogen compound, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, were also used to determine the relationship between estradiol-induced cell proliferation and cAMP phosphodiesterase activity. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase was almost completely restricted to the cytosolic fraction (108,000 X g supernatant) of the quail oviduct homogenate. By affinity chromatography on immobilized calmodulin, we separated and partially characterized three different forms of the enzyme. They differed in their cyclic nucleotide specificities, kinetics, and sensitivity to calmodulin. In vivo, estradiol benzoate (EB) modulated crude cytosolic phosphodiesterase activity. cAMP and cyclic-GMP hydrolyzing activities increased between 12 and 48 h after a single injection of EB and then declined to return to control value by 96 h. Estrone, 17 alpha-estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone were ineffective, while estriol slightly increased cyclic-GMP hydrolyzing activity. When administered with EB, tamoxifen drastically increased oviduct cAMP concentration while it completely inhibited oviduct growth and the activation of cAMP phosphodiesterase induced by EB alone. Moreover, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine produced a dose-dependent inhibition of oviduct cell proliferation when given with EB. These results demonstrate that the activation of cAMP phosphodiesterase after an injection of EB and the subsequent decrease in oviduct cAMP concentration are necessary for the epithelial cells to achieve their proliferative cycle.\r"

This beta-core population, which can account for as much as 70% of the total beta-immunoreactivity in pregnancy urine, is of interest as both a normal metabolite of pregnancy and a potential marker for malignancy. We have purified the beta-core fragment from pregnancy urine (P-core) and have characterized it with respect to size and carbohydrate composition. P-Core was purified by chromatography on Sephadex G-100, Concanavalin A (Con A)-Sepharose, DEAE-Sephacel, and Sephadex G-75 (superfine). The purified P-core has an apparent mol wt of 17,500 and 17,000, as determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 (superfine) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, respectively. The sialic acid content of P-core was assayed chemically and was less than 0.07 mumol sialic acid/mumole P-core. For comparison to P-core, we have prepared a trypsin fragment of beta-subunit that retains the beta-core immunological determinant recognized by SB6 antiserum and lacks the carboxy-terminal immunological determinant. We have designated this beta-core molecule as T-core (tryptic fragment of beta-subunit) to distinguish it from the beta-core molecule that we have purified from pregnancy urine (i.e. P-core). Most of the P-core and T-core molecules bind to Con A (84% and 86%, respectively). The Con A-bound material was used for subsequent characterizations. Neither P-core nor T-core binds to DEAE using conditions under which intact hCG beta binds to DEAE. A variety of agarose-bound lectins were used to further investigate the carbohydrate nature of the Con A-bound P-core and T-core molecules. The lectin binding data indicate that the antennae on P-core do not contain appreciable sialic acid or galactose, in contrast to the antennae on T-core, which contain both. We conclude that P-core, the naturally occurring beta-core fragment in pregnancy, has been processed to a form in which nearly all of the sialic acid and galactose residues are removed, but the Con A-binding site (consisting of the core sugars) and most of the core fucose are retained.\r"

  ".W": "An elevation of ATP levels in luteal cells markedly enhances their response to gonadotropin. In contrast, depletion of ATP in all cells leads to a series of interrelated events that produces irreversible cell injury. Since the corpus luteum has a transient existence, functional regression and involution of this gland play a fundamental role in the regulation of reproduction. The objective of the present studies was to evaluate whether the luteal ATP content may be regulated in an endocrine fashion and whether luteolysis may be linked to depletion of ATP in the corpus luteum in vivo. The present studies show that removal of the pituitary, maintenance of luteal function in hypophysectomized rats with PRL, or acute treatment with prostaglandin F2 alpha had no effect on luteal ATP levels. However, LH produced a rapid and marked decrease in adenine nucleotide levels in both intact and hypophysectomized PRL-replaced rats, whereas GTP levels were unaffected. In pituitary-intact rats, this same effect of LH occurred within 5 min, was maximal (40% depletion) within 30 min, and was sustained for many hours. Depletion of ATP by LH was dose dependent and evident with low doses of LH. In addition, a decrease in luteal ATP levels was seen during functional luteolysis in the rat, which was directly related to a rise in the serum levels of LH, but not FSH. In contrast, LH had no effect on ATP depletion in isolated cells prepared from the total luteinized ovary, or in enriched preparations of luteal cells. Thus, the depletion of ATP by LH in vivo appears to be mediated by intraovarian agents of unknown nature. We suggest that the rise in LH levels that follows functional luteolysis, due to reduced negative feedback by progesterone, produces a rapid decrease in luteal ATP levels which induces irreversible cell damage and, ultimately, involution of the corpus luteum. This effect would, presumably, be exacerbated as LH levels rise to maximum at ovulation or until LH receptors become down-regulated.\r"

  ".W": "The ovarian granulosa cell has recently been found to be a site of somatomedin-C/insulin-like growth factor I (Sm-C/IGF-I) production, reception, and action, thereby raising the prospect of a novel autocrine control mechanism concerned with granulosa cell ontogeny. It is the objective of the in vitro studies reported herein to explore the characteristics of the murine granulosa cell membrane Sm-C/IGF-I receptor and its regulation by gonadotropic, lactogenic, and beta 2-adrenergic signalling. Provision of FSH (150 ng/ml) to granulosa cells from immature rats cultured for 72 h under serum-free conditions resulted in a 3.1-fold increase over control values in specific cell-bound [125I]iodo-Sm-C/IGF-I. Binding to FSH-primed cells proved time, temperature, and pH dependent; optimal steady state conditions were achieved after an 8-h incubation at 15 C and a pH of 8.0. Although subject to regulation by the cellular density of plating, the binding of [125I]iodo-Sm-C/IGF-I to its receptor proved saturable (apparent Kd = 3.3 X 10(-9) M) as well as reversible; complete or partial tracer displacement was effected by competitive inhibition and dilution, respectively. Specificity studies revealed the competition for [125I]iodo-Sm-C/IGF-I binding to follow a relative rank order of potency of Sm-C/IGF-I much greater than multiplication-stimulating activity greater than insulin, but disclosed limited or no displacement by a series of chemically related and unrelated polypeptides. By Scatchard and Hill analysis, both control and FSH-treated cells displayed a single class of noninteracting binding sites; the FSH-enhanced binding represented largely increased binding capacity, rather than affinity. Significantly, up-regulation of granulosa cell Sm-C/IGF-I binding was not limited to FSH; qualitatively comparable increments in [125I]iodo-Sm-C/IGF-I binding were obtained after treatment with luteotropic, and beta 2-adrenergic (but not lactogenic) granulosa cell agonists. Taken together, these studies provide further evidence for the existence of high affinity, low capacity, specific cell membrane receptors for Sm-C/IGF-I in cultured rat granulosa cells. Our findings further indicate that the ability of FSH to enhance granulosa cell Sm-C/IGF-I binding largely reflects increased binding capacity rather than affinity and that this heterologous up-regulatory phenomenon may not be limited to FSH. As such, our observations of comparable up-regulation after luteotropic and beta 2-adrenergic (but not lactogenic) stimulation are in keeping with the view that cAMP may play an intermediary role in the regulation of granulosa cell type I IGF receptors.\r"

Constant infusions of 3H-labeled androgens, 14C-labeled estrogens, and [3H]F were administered to 11 male cynomolgus monkeys (M. fascicularis) for 3.5 h. Blood samples were obtained from a peripheral vein during the infusion, and all urine was collected for 96 h. In each of 3 monkeys, a catheter was inserted into the hepatic vein, and during the infusions blood samples were obtained from the hepatic and peripheral veins and the femoral artery. All blood and urine samples were analyzed for radioactivity as testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol (E2), and estrone (E1). When indicated, blood samples were also analyzed for radioactivity as F. Blood samples taken before the infusions were analyzed for endogenous T, A, DHT, E1, E2, and F concentrations; percent free T, free E2, and free F; and sex hormone-binding globulin and F-binding globulin capacities. The mean +/- SE MCRs for T, A, E2, E1, and F were 44 +/- 4, 407 +/- 40, 175 +/- 17, 315 +/- 28, and 57 +/- 6 liters/day, respectively. The mean blood production rates were 128 +/- 19, 91 +/- 14, 3.3 +/- 0.5, and 9.2 +/- 1.1 micrograms/day and 13.4 +/- 1.9 mg/day for T, A, E2, E1, and F, respectively. The aromatization of androgens was 1.30 +/- 0.10% for A to E1 and 0.28 +/- 0.03% for T to E2. The percent free F (4.34 +/- 0.42%) was greater than the percent free T (1.73 +/- 0.16%) or free E2 (2.75 +/- 0.22%), and the concentration of F-binding globulin was greater than that of sex hormone-binding globulin (227 +/- 35 vs. 60 +/- 7 nM). In the three monkeys who had hepatic venous catheterization, the mean extraction, across the splanchnic bed of T was 32 +/- 3%, that of E was 62 +/- 2%, and that of cortisol was 12 +/- 5%. Across peripheral tissues (leg) the mean extractions were 13 +/- 1%, 18 +/- 1%, and 6 +/- 4%, respectively. In general, the dynamics of androgen, estrogen, and F production and metabolism are similar in male cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys and in man. The similarity is especially close for peripheral aromatization despite differences in adipose tissue content between man and nonhuman primates.\r"

Amino acid composition was compatible with that of IGF I (somatomedin-C), and amino-terminal sequence analysis revealed homology with IGF-I. The concentration of IGF-I in the calvarial culture medium was 1 nM and was suppressed by cycloheximide. Calvaria-derived rat IGF I at 20 nM stimulated DNA and collagen synthesis by 42% and 26%, respectively, in monolayer cultures of osteoblast-rich rat parietal bone cells.

Enzymatic activity was determined by the release of 125I using [3',5'-125I]T4 as substrate. Daytime levels of 5'-D activity were maximal for anterior pituitary (346.2 +/- 142.5 fmol 125I released/mg protein.h), followed by pineal gland (61.5 +/- 8.7 fmol 125I released/mg protein.h) and frontal cortex (3.1 +/- 0.5 fmol 125I released/mg protein.h). Twenty-four-hour fluctuations of 5'-D activity were apparent in the pineal gland and cortex. For pineal, peak 5'-D activity (43.4 +/- 11.4 fmol 125I released/gland.h) occurred at 0100 h, with values at this time being 8-fold greater than basal daytime levels. Superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGX) or exposure to continuous light (LL) completely abolished the nocturnal rise of 5'-D activity. Treatment with iopanoic acid also inhibited 5'-D activity in pineal (32.1 +/- 3.5 vs. 18.8 +/- 1.7 fmol 125I released/gland.h) without influencing either the N-acetyltransferase activity or the melatonin content. In cortex, peak 5'-D activity occurred at 0500 h (5.3 +/- 0.4 fmol 125I released/mg protein.h), with values at this time being 1.5-fold greater than basal daytime levels. SCGX moderately depressed enzymatic activity, while LL exposure strikingly enhanced the nocturnal increase (11.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 19.3 +/- 2.4 fmol 125I released/mg protein.h at 0300 h). 5'-D activity exhibited no 24-h fluctuation in the anterior pituitary gland, and neither SCGX nor LL exposure affected enzyme levels in this tissue. Our data demonstrate the existence of a 24-h rhythm of type II T4 5'-D activity in pineal gland and cortex, with peak levels occurring at night; in pineal, the sympathetic neural input is indispensable for the rhythm, since SCGX prevented it. In cortex, the apparent paradoxical effect of LL and SCGX on 5'-D activity indicates that other mechanisms are involved in its regulation.\r"

  ".W": "Blastocyst implantation in the mouse uterus is triggered by an estrogen surge that induces a number of characteristic changes in biosynthetic activity of the endometrial stroma and epithelium, including a reduction in the thickness of the epithelial plasma membrane coat, immediately preceding attachment of the blastocyst. A brief exposure of the uterine luminal surface to 1% Nonidet-40 (NP-40) nonionic detergent extracted this surface coat along with membrane-associated and soluble [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycans specifically from the epithelium. Extraction from the underlying stroma appeared to have been prevented by the epithelial basal lamina, which was minimally affected by 1% NP-40, but was extracted by subsequent treatment with 1% NP-40 in 1 M KCl. About 70-80% of the [35S]sulfate in proteoglycans extracted from the uteri of ovariectomized mice with NP-40 was associated with heparan sulfate proteoglycans that eluted from Sepharose CL-4B in a peak at 0.55 Kd. All remaining radioactivity could be accounted for by dermatan sulfate/chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Specifically, in the NP-40 extract of uteri from ovariectomized mature mice and intact immature mice, but not in the culture medium or residual tissue, estradiol induced a pronounced increase in the relative amount of radioactivity in a 0.8 Kd peak, which appeared to contain only free heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains. The same relative increase was seen in the NP-40 extract of uteri from intact 3.5-day pregnant mice. We conclude that estradiol induces cellular changes that result in an increased accumulation of epithelial heparan sulfate proteoglycan degradation product immediately preceding normal attachment of the blastocyst.\r"

Histomorphometry techniques were developed to measure the incorporation of [2,3-3H]proline and [methyl-3H]thymidine into bone matrix and bone cell nuclei, respectively, using autoradiographs of sagittal sections of calvariae cultured with IGF-I, insulin, or vehicle for up to 96 h. To confirm an effect on bone formation, IGF-I was also studied for its effects on [3H]proline incorporation into collagenase-digestible protein (CDP) and noncollagen protein and on [3H]thymidine incorporation into acid-precipitable material (DNA). IGF-I at 10(-9)-10(-7) M significantly increased the rate of bone matrix apposition and CDP after 24 h by 45-50% and increased cell labeling by 8-fold in the osteoprogenitor cell zone, by 4-fold in the osteoblast cell zone, and by 2-fold in the periosteal fibroblast zone. Insulin at 10(-9)-10(-6) M also increased matrix apposition rate and CDP by 40-50%, but increased cell labeling by 2-fold only at a concentration of 10(-7) M or higher and then only in the osteoprogenitor cell zone. When hydroxyurea was added to IGF-I-treated bones, the effects of IGF-I on DNA synthesis were abolished, but the increase in bone matrix apposition induced by IGF-I was only partly diminished. In conclusion, IGF-I stimulates matrix synthesis in calvariae, an effect that is partly, although not completely, dependent on its stimulatory effect on DNA synthesis.\r"

In gonadectomized rats, larger, more numerous LH beta- and 7B2-immunoreactive gonadotropes were seen than in controls. Extractable 7B2-like immunoreactivity was elevated but not significantly so in gonadectomized rat pituitaries [males: castrated, 37.4 +/- 4.3 (mean +/- SE); controls, 26.9 +/- 4.3; females: ovariectomized, 27.2 +/- 2.7; controls, 19.1 +/- 2.2 pmol/gland]. Neuromedin B immunoreactivity was found in normal rat and mouse thyrotropes and weakly in \"thyroidectomy\" cells in hypothyroid rats, in which extractable pituitary neuromedin B was significantly depleted (thyroidectomized, 87.0 +/- 14.0; methimazole-treated, 82.0 +/- 11.4; control, 230.7 +/- 25.6 fmol/gland). Hyperthyroid rat pituitaries showed increased TSH beta and neuromedin B immunoreactivities and neuromedin B content (TRH-treated, 385.2 +/- 30.2; T4-treated, 352.6 +/- 20.2; control, 230.7 +/- 25.6 fmol/gland). Neuromedin U immunoreactivity occurred in corticotropes of all species, in rat and mouse intermediate lobe, and throughout the rat hypothalamus, with immunoreactive cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus. Neuromedin U-immunoreactive cells were present in six of six human pituitary and five of six human extrapituitary corticotropinomas. In adrenalectomized rats, corticotropes were larger and more numerous than in controls, but extractable anterior pituitary neuromedin U-like immunoreactivity was not raised (adrenalectomized, 3.30 +/- 0.45; control, 3.32 +/- 0.27 pmol/gland). Our findings suggest that 7B2, neuromedin B, and neuromedin U may be involved in pituitary function.\r"

Pituitaries were incubated in medium containing [3H]glucosamine for 24 h. TSH was immunoprecipitated from medium and pituitary sonicates using anti-TSH beta serum, digested with pronase to obtain TSH glycopeptides, desalted, then analyzed by Concanavalin-A (Con-A) chromatography. Compared to sham controls, hypothalamus-lesioned animals contained a greater proportion of secreted TSH glycopeptides that bound weakly to Con-A, indicating a shift from bisecting and/or multiantennary structures in control animals to biantennary and/or truncated hybrid forms in hypothalamus-lesioned animals. In contrast, thyroidectomized animals, compared to normal and lesioned animals, contained a greater proportion of secreted TSH glycopeptides that did not bind to Con-A, indicating a shift from biantennary and/or truncated hybrid forms to bisecting and/or multiantennary forms. The characteristics of the carbohydrate chains on secreted TSH differed markedly in hypothalamic vs. primary hypothyroidism despite equally low thyroid hormone levels in vivo. Thus, in addition to regulating TSH secretion, hypothalamic hormones alter TSH carbohydrate structure, which may affect its bioactivity and MCR.\r"

  ".U": "88082455\r", 
  ".W": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, was examined in the lipid-filled outer cortical cells and smooth endoplasmic reticulum-filled inner cortical cells of guinea pig adrenals. The specific activity of HMG CoA reductase was higher in microsomes obtained from the outer cortex, but was stimulated by ACTH and suppressed by dexamethasone (DEX) in both regions. Immunoblots of the microsomal proteins revealed a higher concentration of immunoreactive HMG CoA reductase (mol wt 94K) in microsomes from outer cortical cells. Changes in the intensity of this band corresponded to changes in activity after treatment with ACTH and DEX. However, quantitative immunoassay revealed that changes in activity in the inner zone after ACTH and in both zones after DEX were greater than could be accounted for by changes in immunodetectable protein, implying that other regulatory factors play a role in these cases. Incubation of outer and inner cortical tissues in vitro showed that outer cortical tissue had a greater capacity to incorporate [14C]acetate into cellular cholesterol (free and esterified) and into secreted steroid than did inner cortical tissue. ACTH enhanced the incorporation of [14C]acetate by outer cortical tissues into secreted steroid, but had little effect on incorporation by inner cortical tissues. Assay of the medium indicated that outer cortical tissues secreted much more steroid and increased secretion in response to ACTH, whereas inner cortical tissues secreted little steroid and were little affected by ACTH. Taken together, these results show that outer cortical cells have a greater capacity for cholesterol synthesis and that enhancement of this capacity after ACTH treatment is correlated with an increase in HMG CoA reductase protein. On the other hand, while the level of HMG CoA reductase immunodetectable protein and activity in inner cortical cell microsomes is considerable and appears to increase after ACTH treatment, it is not translated into an ability to synthesize cholesterol. This suggests that the activity of the immunodetectable HMG CoA reductase in the inner zone is suppressed in vivo and that the prominent smooth endoplasmic reticulum found in inner cortical cells has additional functions. The inability of the inner zone to synthesize cholesterol accounts in part for its low steroid production.\r"

Six hours after a single injection of E2 (5 micrograms/100 g BW), uterine IGF-I gene expression was increased 22.5 +/- 5.4-fold (P less than 0.005) above that in untreated rats. In the same experiment E2 alone had no significant effect on hepatic IGF-I gene expression. Similarly, in chronic experiments uterine IGF-I in ovx-hypox rats receiving 0.1 or 1 microgram/rat.day E2 for 10 days was significantly increased compared to that in ovx-hypox rats that did not receive E2 [5.38 +/- 0.79 vs. 1.10 +/- 0.15 (P less than 0.005) and 6.64 +/- 0.28 vs. 0.93 +/- 0.06 (P less than 0.005), respectively]. While administration of human GH alone significantly increased uterine IGF-I expression (3.76 +/- 1.61-fold compared to that in untreated rats; P less than 0.05), a significant and reproducible attenuation of E2-induced IGF-I expression was seen in the two acute experiments where GH reduced the E2-induced response by 36 +/- 3.7% and 53 +/- 19.4%. While chronic administration of E2 to ovx-hypox rats resulted in uterine growth, a significant decrease in body weight was seen in rats treated with 1 microgram/day E2 compared to that in untreated ovx-hypox controls (-4.3 +/- 1.5 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.6 g; P less than 0.0005). E2 treatment also significantly decreased the GH-induced increase in weight gain at each GH dose by approximately 40%. GH-induced hepatic IGF-I gene expression and serum IGF-I concentration were similarly reduced by chronic E2 administration. In contrast, in acute experiments where E2 alone had no effect on hepatic IGF-I expression, it acted in a synergistic fashion with GH and resulted in significantly greater accumulation of IGF-I mRNA. From these observations we conclude that 1) both E2 and human GH are potent stimulators of IGF-I gene expression in appropriate target tissues; and 2) in addition to any effects E2 has on GH secretion and IGF-I action, the growth-retarding effect of estrogen in the rat involves inhibition of GH-dependent hepatic IGF-I expression.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to evaluate the possible physiological role of oxytocin (OXY) on PRL release by examining the effect of administration of potent pharmacological antagonists of OXY on the stimulation of PRL secretion observed in vitro from anterior pituitary (AP) cells in response to OXY administration or in a number of in vivo paradigms. OXY caused a dose-related increase in PRL release from dispersed AP cells and short term AP cell cultures which was blocked by administration of the OXY antagonists [1-deaminopenicillamine, 2-O-methyltyrosine, 8-ornithine]vasotocin (dPOMeOVT) or [1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylene propanoic acid)2-O-methyltyrosine, 8-ornithine]vasotocin (MPOMeOVT), respectively. The antagonists were given in vivo in a dose that completely blocked suckling-induced milk let-down for up to 90 min. Injection of the antagonists did not alter the 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced increase in plasma PRL or the increase associated with acute ether stress or acute suckling stimuli, suggesting that OXY is not a major component involved in the neuroendocrine mechanisms responsible for those particular increases. On the other hand, iv administration of dPOMeOVT or MPOMeOVT prevented the increase in plasma PRL normally observed on the afternoon of proestrus in the cycling female rat. The characteristic surge of LH was also blocked by high doses of these antagonists. These data demonstrate that PRL secretion undergoes a differential regulation, in that OXY appears to play a major role in regulating the increase in plasma PRL observed on the afternoon of proestrus, but apparently provides little, if any, contribution toward the neuroendocrine regulation of the increases in PRL associated with 5-hydroxytryptophan administration, acute ether stress stimulus, or acute suckling stimulus. The data also suggest that OXY receptors located in the AP that are involved in the OXY-induced increase in PRL release may be similar to those OXY receptors located in mammary and uterine tissue, since specific biological effects of OXY in those tissues are effectively blocked by the OXY antagonists dPOMeOVT and MPOMeOVT. A possible role of OXY neurons in the neural mechanisms triggering the LH surge during proestrus is also suggested.\r"

Evidence is presented here that locally-produced VIP acts in an autocrine fashion to stimulate PRL release. VIP antibodies or a VIP antagonist profoundly but reversibly suppressed PRL secretion in primary cultures of rat pituitary cells or the GH3 cell line. This evidence was obtained with the use of a reverse hemolytic plaque assay for microscopic demonstration of PRL release from individual cells under conditions precluding cell-cell interaction. We suggest that most of the high rate of \"spontaneous\" PRL secretion attributed to lactotropes deprived of hypothalamic influence is due in fact to the stimulatory effects of VIP acting in an autocrine fashion.\r"

At all times examined these cultures contained mostly alpha MSH-sized and corticotropin-like intermediate lobe peptide-sized peptides; the alpha MSH-sized peptides were predominantly diacetyl-ACTH-(1-13)NH2. After 6 days in culture, the intermediate pituitary lobe cells retained the ability to synthesize diacetyl-ACTH-(1-13)NH2. Compared to that of the adult, the newborn anterior pituitary lobe is enriched in high mol wt forms of ACTH-related molecules. Therefore, the ability of newborn anterior pituitary lobe cell cultures to develop the adult processing pattern in culture was investigated. After 6 days in culture, peptides the size of alpha MSH predominated rather than ACTH-(1-39), which is the major form found in the adult. Immunocytochemical studies showed that all cultured newborn corticotropes strongly stained for alpha MSH-related material. The alpha MSH-sized molecules were identified as ACTH-(1-13)NH2 by reverse phase HPLC. In 6-day-old cultures of neonatal anterior pituitary lobes grown in the presence of a synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, the amount of alpha MSH-sized material was diminished, and instead, precursor forms of the ACTH-related peptides were detected. In biosynthetic labeling experiments, the ratio of newly synthesized ACTH-(1-13)NH2 to ACTH-(1-39) was greatly reduced by treatment of the cells with dexamethasone. The extensive cleavage of ACTH-(1-39) and its regulation by dexamethasone are unique to newborn anterior pituitary lobe corticotropes; such plasticity is not observed in cultures of adult tissue.\r"

Five pregnant baboons (Papio anubis) received increasing numbers of 50-mg implants of androstenedione inserted sc at 8-day intervals between days 70 and 100 of gestation (term = day 184) to elevate the production of estrogen. Five animals served as controls at midgestation and received implants containing no steroid, while four baboons were studied near term between days 164-170 of gestation. All animals were bled from a maternal saphenous vein at 2-day intervals, and the serum was assayed for estradiol. On days 100 or 170 of gestation, transuterofetoplacental corticosteroid dynamics were determined by the constant infusion method. Baboons were anesthetized with ketamine and halothane-nitrous oxide and a constant infusion of [3H]F/[14C]E initiated via a maternal saphenous vein. At 60 min, animals were laparotomized and at 70, 80, and 90 min, blood samples were obtained from right and left uterine veins and from a maternal saphenous vein. At 95 min, an incision was made in the uterus, and blood samples were obtained from the umbilical vein and artery. Radiolabeled F and E were extracted from serum and purified by paper chromatography. Maternal serum E2 concentrations (nanograms per ml; mean +/- SE) were greater (P less than 0.01) between days 94 and 100 of gestation in androstenedione-treated baboons (2.4 +/- 0.3) than in untreated animals at midgestation (0.7 +/- 0.2), but lower than those near term (4.5 +/- 1.0). On day 100 of gestation, conversion of E to F across the uterus in control animals (30%) was similar to that of the reverse reaction (23%). In androstenedione-treated baboons at midgestation the conversion of E----F (8%) was lower (P less than 0.05) than the oxidation of F----E (27%) and not different from that in untreated baboons at term (E----F = 13%; F----E = 28%). The dominance of transuterofetoplacental conversion of F----E over the conversion of E----F in term and in androstenedione-treated animals at midgestation was maintained when transfer constants were corrected for fetal metabolic contributions. We conclude that the increase in placental estrogen production induced by androstenedione administration at midgestation alters the pattern of transuterofetoplacental F-E metabolism, supporting the hypothesis that estrogen regulates placental corticosteroid metabolism.\r"

Therefore, we determined the MCR, production, peripheral interconversion, and placental extraction of F and E in the baboon fetus at midgestation. Radiolabeled F and E were infused into a femoral vein of fetuses (n = 7; 4 female, 3 male) exteriorized on day 100 of gestation (term = day 184). The MCR of F in the fetus (5.6 +/- 0.8 1/day) was lower (P less than 0.01) than that of E (13.1 +/- 2.2 1/day). Placental extraction of F (72.8 +/- 5.3%) and E (87.8 +/- 2.4%) were extensive indicating that the placenta contributes to fetal F/E MCR. Although the serum concentration (micrograms per dl) of F (20 +/- 2) exceeded (P less than 0.01) that of E (12 +/- 1), the calculated production rate (milligrams per day) of F (1.09 +/- 0.12) was not significantly different from that of E (1.55 +/- 0.27). The transfer constant for fetal conversion of F to E (29.0 +/- 6.0%) exceeded (P less than 0.01) that for reduction of E to F (1.8 +/- 0.4%). Therefore, the proportion of total F production derived from circulating E was only 2.2%, whereas the proportion of E derived from circulating F was 26.7%. These findings demonstrate that at midgestation the baboon fetus has minimal capacity for peripheral conversion of biologically inactive E to biologically active F, whereas the reverse conversion (F to E) is substantial.\r"

Scatchard analysis revealed a single set of binding sites with an apparent Kd of 0.84 microM, and a binding capacity of 39 pmol/mg membrane protein. The sites were specific for CBG; binding of [125I]CBG was not inhibited by a 10,000-fold excess of either rat albumin or rat transferrin. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate of the membrane-bound [125I]CBG revealed the presence of lower mol wt iodinated products which were undetectable in the unbound [125I]CBG fraction. Further, whereas the electrophoretic patterns from uterine, pulmonary, and renal membranes showed that the less mobile band (mol wt, 60K) of the normal CBG doublet appeared to be metabolized to a greater extent than the more mobile band (mol wt, 52K), those from splenic membranes showed equal metabolism of both parts of the doublet.\r"

AII infusion in untreated dogs produced dose-related increases in plasma cortisol and aldosterone concentrations. The plasma ACTH concentration also increased. Dexamethasone treatment lowered the basal cortisol concentration from 1.7 +/- 0.1 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/dl (P less than 0.05) and the ACTH concentration from 52 +/- 3 to 41 +/- 4 pg/ml (P less than 0.05), and abolished the cortisol response to all doses of AII, indicating that ACTH was necessary for the response. On the other hand, the basal aldosterone concentration was not significantly affected by dexamethasone, although the aldosterone response to the highest dose of AII was reduced. Additional experiments were performed to determine if the cortisol and aldosterone responses to AII (20 ng kg-1 min-1) in dexamethasone-treated dogs are restored if the ACTH concentration is maintained near control levels by iv infusion of synthetic alpha ACTH-(1-24) (0.3 ng kg-1 min-1). AII still failed to increase the plasma cortisol concentration in this group of dogs; however, the aldosterone response was fully restored. To evaluate the effect of elevated ACTH levels on the steroidogenic effects of AII, dogs were treated with dexamethasone and a higher dose of ACTH (0.4 ng kg-1 min-1). This dose of ACTH increased the plasma cortisol concentration from 1.7 +/- 0.1 to 3.5 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl (P less than 0.05), but did not significantly affect the plasma aldosterone concentration. In the presence of constant elevated levels of ACTH, AII (10 and 20 ng kg-1 min-1) increased the plasma cortisol concentration in dexamethasone-treated dogs, although the response to the 10 ng kg-1 min-1 dose was smaller than the response in untreated dogs. Infusion of AII at 5 ng kg-1 min-1 did not increase the plasma cortisol concentration. In contrast, the increased plasma aldosterone produced by AII infusion in dexamethasone-treated dogs was not altered in the presence of elevated ACTH levels. Finally, AII infusion did not alter the clearance of cortisol. Collectively, these results demonstrate that an increase in plasma ACTH is necessary for the cortisol response to AII infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Follicles aspirated in the cycle when no oocytes were recovered were shown to be neither atretic follicles, follicular cysts, nor prematurely luteinized follicles. The steroid profile of follicular fluid from the index cycle was characterized by a markedly increased estradiol-to-progesterone ratio and an increased androstenedione level. This, together with a comparison to the steroid profiles of fluid from follicles containing either fertilizable or nonfertilizable oocytes, suggests that the empty follicle syndrome may reflect a dysfunctional ovulation induction.\r"

  ".W": "Endotoxins were detected in a few batches of culture medium during the authors' human in vitro fertilization program. Two distinct levels of endotoxins were assayed: greater than 1 ng/ml and less than 1 ng/ml. The source of endotoxin was traced to culture media obtained from a reputable manufacturing company. The incidence of fertilization per patient was not significantly affected by the presence of endotoxins, but fertilization assessed on the overall number of oocytes was significantly reduced (53%) when endotoxin levels were greater than 1 ng/ml compared with an assay negative for endotoxins (66%) (P = 0.047). The percentage of oocytes cleaving after the observation of two pronuclei was not significantly different, but the degree of fragments observed in the conceptus was significantly more severe if the endotoxin level reached 1 ng/ml. In this investigation, the incidence of pregnancy was 8% when the endotoxin level was greater than 1 ng/ml, 30% if less than 1 ng/ml, and 32% if no endotoxins were detected. This study suggests that, although endotoxins may be present in the culture medium at a deleterious level of at least 1 ng/ml, fertilization and cleavage will be obtained, but there will be a significant increase in the incidence of conceptuses with cytoplasmic fragments; this may result in a reduction in the incidence of pregnancy.\r"

This factor was analyzed in 825 consecutive embryo transfer cycles. The pregnancy rate decreased significantly after the transfer of one and two embryos in association with preovulatory E2 levels greater than the 90th percentile for the group (2320 pg/ml). The pregnancy rate did not vary with preovulatory E2 concentration following the transfer of three embryos. Highly significant correlations were noted between preovulatory E2 and early luteal phase concentrations of E2 and P. In a subgroup of 245 cycles, there were no significant relationships between implantation and early luteal phase levels of P or the ratio of E2/P. There was a small but nonsignificant tendency for the pregnancy rate to decrease in association with raised luteal E2. It is concluded that excessive E2 levels at the time of ovulation induction with hCG had an adverse effect on implantation when one or two embryos are transferred, but this may be overcome by the transfer of three embryos. The consequences for embryo transfer are discussed.\r"

Mucus penetration tests were performed in vitro using commercial preparations of bovine cervical mucus. A highly significant (P less than 0.001) correlation between mucus penetration distance and sperm count (r = 0.582), motility (r = 0.357), velocity (r = 0.569), motile density (r = 0.582), motility index (r = 0.467), and morphology (r = 0.383) was observed. Increased percentages of immature germ cells (r = -0.318) and bent-tailed sperm (r = -0.221) were the most strongly correlated with mucus penetration. Approximately 10% to 15% of patients with otherwise normal semen parameters displayed poor penetration of mucus. Conversely, 5% to 40% of patients with abnormal semen parameters displayed excellent penetration of the mucus. Motile density and velocity demonstrated the strongest relationship with the outcome of the mucus penetration test. These results suggest that a significant subpopulation of patients can be identified as having inadequate (or adequate) penetration of mucus with otherwise normal (or abnormal) motility characteristics.\r"

Animals were randomized to receive equal volumes of either (1) Ringer's lactate (RL); (2) 32% dextran 70 (HY; Hyskon Division, Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ); (3) 500 mg P in oil (PO); or (4) 500 mg aqueous P (PA) at initial laparotomy. In phase II, the distal right uterine horn, including the mesosalpinx, was excised and microsurgical anastomosis was accomplished (n = 45). Aqueous P was not used in phase II; otherwise, the same agents were tested. Six weeks later, the severity of the adhesions formed was graded. The mean adhesion scores for the RL and HY groups were low for the right side in both phases and did not differ (P greater than 0.05). In contrast, higher scores were observed in all the P groups, regardless of the P preparation used or the surgical procedure performed (P less than 0.05).\r"

Media used in these experiments was stored both without (old protocol) or with triple gas equilibration (new protocol). Development was assessed by the percent of embryos developing to the 2-cell stage and on to the morula and blastocyst stages. Triple gas equilibration prior to media storage improved development to the morula and blastocyst stages. Development to the 2-cell and morula stages was not adversely affected by the presence of serum, but development to the blastocyst stage was significantly higher in Ham's F-10 medium without serum at all pHs tested. In conditions without serum, percent development at all stages examined was similar over the pH range of 7.17 to 7.37, with a significant decrease in development to the morula and blastocyst stage at pH 7.50. Embryos cultured in the presence of serum demonstrated a greater decrease in the percent development to blastocyst at both the low, 7.17 and 7.27, and high, 7.50, pHs, with an apparent pH optimum at 7.37. In summary, the complex media Ham's F-10 medium supports mouse embryo development without the need for serum. Serum inhibits pronuclear embryo development to the blastocyst stage. Mouse embryo culture in the absence of serum can tolerate a pH as low as 7.17 (8.4% CO2) without any detrimental effects.\r"

A pregnancy was achieved by natural intercourse during the first cycle in which conception was attempted. More than 50% of sperm were bound by ASAs during the cycle in which conception occurred. These results suggest that ASA binding to certain regions of the sperm surface have no adverse effect on fertility. Therefore, when diagnosing the fertility status of males with ASAs, it appears prudent to use tests that permit determination of the regional distribution of ASA binding to sperm, rather than tests that only permit determination of the presence or absence of ASAs in test fluids.\r"

Despite scrupulous microsurgical techniques, complete absence of adnexal adherences was present in only 31 of 73 (42.5%) patients without initial adhesions and in 15 of 183 (8.2%) patients who had adhesions lysed. New or reformed adhesions usually were easily separable, often without bleeding, and often with much apparent improvement in fimbrio-ovarian anatomy. There were no significant complications and the safety of early postoperative (second-look) laparoscopy seems established. A modification of the 1979 American Fertility Society endometriosis scoring system was used to quantitate adhesions in 38 patients who subsequently underwent an additional (third-look) pelvic procedure. Adhesions were worse as a result of the laparoscopy in no patients, unchanged in 5 patients, and improved in 33 patients; overall, there was a significant reduction in median adhesion scores from 8 at laparoscopy (95% confidence limits of median, 6 to 10) to 2 at final observation (95% limits, 0 to 4; P less than 0.001, rank sum test). Laparoscopy between the time of serosal healing (8 days) and established adhesion fibrosis (21 days) is a safe and effective way of reducing peritoneal adhesions after pelvic operations in young women.\r"

  ".W": "Danazol concentrations in follicular fluid and serum were studied in eight women scheduled for laparoscopy because of suspected endometriosis. In order to obtain some variation in follicular maturity, danazol administration was started 2 to 7 days before the expected day of ovulation. A total of nine doses were given, i.e., 200 mg four times daily for 2 days; the last 200-mg dose was given 3 hours before the laparoscopy during which the follicular fluid from the dominant follicle was aspirated. Peripheral venous blood samples were drawn before, during, and after laparoscopy. Danazol concentrations were assayed by means of a high-performance liquid chromatography method. At the time of follicular aspiration, the mean concentration of danazol was estimated at 96 ng/ml in serum and at 71 ng/ml in follicular fluid, i.e., an average of 73% of the simultaneous serum concentration. The data suggest that even short-term therapy with danazol is likely to produce intrafollicular drug concentrations that have a direct inhibitory effect on follicular steroidogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the disparity between clinical presentation and prolactin (PRL) measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA), serum samples from 128 patients with galactorrhea and/or reproductive disorders were evaluated by RIA for immunoassayable PRL (RIA-PRL) and by Nb2 lymphoma cell proliferation assay for bioassayable PRL (bioassay-PRL). One hundred fifteen patients had normal RIA-PRL and 13 patients had high RIA-PRL (greater than 25 ng/ml). Twenty patients had galactorrhea, two of whom had hyperprolactinemia. The reproductive disorders in female patients included infertility, amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, irregular menstrual cycles, and luteal phase defects. Six oligospermic males also were studied. Twenty-three male and female volunteers with no evidence of reproductive disorders served as controls. Appropriate comparisons showed that PRL bioassay/RIA ratio, an index of agreement between the two assay systems, did not differ for the various patient groups compared with controls. It is concluded that Nb2 lymphoma bioassay does not provide additional diagnostic value to RIA in defining the cause of euprolactinemic galactorrhea and/or reproductive disorders.\r"

  ".W": "The recent advent of ultrasound-guided follicular aspiration by various approaches now allows access to ovaries previously deemed inaccessible by laparoscopy; however, a small group of candidates for in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) require laparotomy for associated gynecologic disorders. Twenty-five IVF-ET cycles at the time of laparotomy were compared with 309 IVF-ET cycles in which oocytes were retrieved laparoscopically. Five pregnancies occurred in the IVF-ET cycle with laparotomy and one pregnancy occurred spontaneously following microsurgical tubal reconstruction. The pregnancy rate per embryo transfer was 25% in the laparotomy IVF-ET patients compared with 15.4% for the laparoscopy IVF-ET group. Obvious advantages of combining IVF-ET and pelvic reconstructive surgery include a single anesthesia exposure and economic benefits. Patients with a long history of infertility undergoing tubal reconstructive surgery may be offered combined IVF-ET. Extended anesthesia exposure with pelvic surgery demonstrated no adverse effects on the pregnancy rate.\r"

We investigated the alterations in erythrocyte surface characteristics that may contribute to their abnormal adherence. The organization of phospholipids in the lipid bilayer, as determined by phospholipase A2 treatment and chemical labeling with fluorescamine and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), is altered in erythrocytes from diabetic patients. Specifically, 12-18% of phosphatidylserine in diabetic erythrocytes (n = 25) is accessible to phospholipase A2 hydrolysis and TNBS labeling, compared to none in normal subjects. These results suggest either a loss in lipid asymmetry or in vivo destabilization of erythrocyte membranes in diabetic patients, causing increased accessibility to phospholipase A2 degradation. The dye merocyanine 540 (MC-540), which is sensitive to the packing of lipids in the bilayer of the membrane, revealed more binding and fluorescence in erythrocytes from diabetic patients than in those from normal subjects. On flow cytometric analysis, 64.5 +/- 17.0% red blood cells (RBCs) in diabetic patients, compared to 35.1 +/- 25.9% RBCs in normal subjects, showed positive MC-540 binding, indicating significant (P less than .001) differences in the packing of lipids in the external leaflet of the bilayer. The results of our study suggest that a loss of lipid asymmetry and/or less ordered packing in the outer leaflet of the diabetic erythrocyte membrane may be responsible for the increased propensity of erythrocytes to adhere to vascular endothelium.\r"

Nineteen consecutive sex- and age-matched nondiabetic subjects were controls. A quantitative study of a random sample of glomeruli was performed blindly on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-stained sections. The main parameters obtained were 1) mean volume of open glomeruli, 2) frequency of glomerular occlusion, and 3) volume fraction of red-stained material (PAS-positive substance) in open glomeruli [Vv(R/G)]. There was no increase in glomerular volume in these NIDDM subjects, contrary to the glomerular hypertrophy found early as well as late in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. An increase in Vv(R/G) was found in diabetic subjects, demonstrating the presence of glomerulopathy as it is diagnosed by light microscopy. The frequency of glomerular occlusion was not significantly different between the groups. A high urinary albumin concentration did not necessarily reflect more advanced glomerulopathy.\r"

Diabetes decreased by 80-95% the total rates of fatty acid and 3-beta-hydroxysterol synthesis in perfused livers and livers of live rats. The activity of cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase was slightly (17%) decreased in livers from STZ-D rats. The incorporation of ketone bodies into fatty acids and sterols was markedly inhibited in perfused livers from STZ-D rats despite the stimulation of ketogenesis by diabetes and the presence of oleate. Treatment of the rats with insulin before liver perfusion led to a normalization of the rates of ketogenesis and fatty acid synthesis. The rates of sterol synthesis were only partially normalized by insulin treatment. We conclude that in STZ-D, ketosis does not stimulate hepatic lipogenesis via cytosolic activation of acetoacetate.\r"

  ".W": "The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for diagnosis of diabetes is inconvenient and requires a great deal of patient cooperation. Glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb), an index of long-term glycemic control, could offer several practical advantages over the OGTT for diabetes screening. We evaluated GHb as a screen for diabetes in 381 adults from a population with a high prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes (Pima Indians). All individuals underwent a standard OGTT (75 g) and were separated into one of three groups: normal (N), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or diabetes mellitus (D) based on World Health Organization criteria. HbA1c, a GHb, was measured by highly precise high-performance liquid chromatography (interassay C.V. less than 4%). The normal range for HbA1c was 4.07-6.03% based on the 95% confidence interval for a nondiabetic, mostly Caucasian population. Compared with OGTT, HbA1c was highly specific (91%); an elevated HbA1c usually indicated D or IGT (sensitivity = 85 and 30%, respectively). A normal HbA1c did not, however, exclude a diagnosis of D or IGT. Based on previous epidemiological studies relating plasma glucose to chronic diabetic complications, GHb as measured in this study would properly identify the vast majority of subjects at risk. Long-term studies are necessary to determine the actual risk of complications in individuals with persistently normal HbA1c and D or IGT (based on OGTT).\r"

To evaluate bone mass, we performed radiogrammetry and single- and dual-photon absorptiometry. In women, a significantly lower mean BMC was found in the distal radius, at a mixed trabecular-cortical (P less than .01) and a cortical (P less than .05) site, as well as in the lumbar spine (P less than .02). In diabetic men, mean BMC was significantly reduced at the trabecularcortical (P less than .01) and cortical (P less than .05) sites of the radius but not in the lumbar spine. When expressed as densities (i.e., BMC/width or lumbar BMC/area), only the BMC/width at the radius cortical area was significantly reduced in women (P less than .05). The results of the radiogrammetry showed a larger endosteal diameter in the diabetic women, resulting in a significantly lower cortical thickness (P less than .05). Diabetic men did not show abnormalities on radiogrammetry. Diabetic patients had diminished serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations (P less than .001), whereas serum parathyroid, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and concentrations of both total and free 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were normal. No correlation between parameters of diabetes control (HbA1, insulin dose, and triglycerides) or calcium-regulating hormones and BMC were found. These data confirm that, despite large overlap of individual values, mean bone mass at the peripheral skeleton is significantly decreased in diabetic patients. Moreover, we report that the BMC of the lumbar spine is significantly reduced in female diabetic patients.\r"

We have investigated this mechanism in the rat stomach via gross morphologic, videomicroscopic, histochemical, and pharmacologic approaches. Within 1 min of contact, ethanol caused diffuse mucosal hyperemia. By 5 min, hyperemia greatly intensified at some mucosal sites. Beneath sites where mucosal hyperemia developed, intramural venules strongly constricted at 3-13 s postethanol, whereas submucosal arterioles dilated more than two times in diameter by 25 s. Submucosal venular constriction began sooner than arteriolar dilation (9 vs. 16 s, p less than 0.05). One-third of the gastric mucosal mast cells degranulated by 15 s postethanol; 50% discharged by 30 s. Ethanol-induced hyperemia was markedly reduced by lipoxygenase-selective inhibitors BW755C or nordihydroguaiaretic acid, or by the H1-antihistamine pyrilamine, but not by indomethacin, cimetidine, phentolamine, or methysergide. Based on these results, a model for the pathogenesis of ethanol-induced gastric lesions is proposed.\r"

Phenylalanine and tryptophan potentiated the gastric secretory responses following low doses of pentagastrin, whereas their effects on acid secretion stimulated by low doses of histamine or the cholinergic bethanecol were additive. Phenylalanine and tryptophan did not increase maximal acid output stimulated by pentagastrin, histamine, or bethanecol. Doses of the H2-receptor antagonist ranitidine, the prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol, atropine, and somatostatin that produced approximately 50% inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion significantly inhibited phenylalanine- and tryptophan-stimulated acid secretion. After the combination of either phenylalanine or tryptophan with pentagastrin, the H2-receptor antagonist significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion, whereas somatostatin, atropine, and the prostaglandin E1 analogue were not effective. These results indicate that both phenylalanine and tryptophan potentiate gastric acid secretion stimulated by a submaximal dose of pentagastrin, whereas their effects on histamine- and bethanecol-stimulated secretion are additive. The potentiating effects of phenylalanine and tryptophan on pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion depend, at least in part, on intact histamine pathways.\r"

Previous studies suggest that this effect of camostate occurs via an increase in endogenous cholecystokinin due to an enteral feedback mechanism involving the inhibition of trypsin in the duodenum. Studies employing proglumide, a weak and relatively nonspecific cholecystokinin antagonist, have failed to fully abolish camostate-induced pancreas growth. We examined the effects of L-364,718, a new and highly potent cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, on camostate-induced pancreas growth in rats. The pancreas weights and the concentrations of ribonucleic acid, protein, and chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas of rats treated with camostate alone were significantly elevated over those of controls. These effects of camostate were completely abolished in rats treated with camostate + L-364,718. The pancreas weights and the concentrations of deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid in the pancreas of rats treated with L-364,718 alone were significantly lower than values in control rats. These data indicate that camostate-induced pancreas growth in rats appears to be dependent on the actions of endogenous cholecystokinin and that cholecystokinin may play a role in the maintenance of pancreatic growth in normal rats.\r"

On the basis of cell-free translation and complementary deoxyribonucleic acid cloning experiments, abundant mRNAs coding for small polypeptides of 6-12 kilodaltons (low-molecular-weight mRNAs) were found in adult small intestine but not in the fetal gut. These developmentally regulated low-molecular-weight mRNAs are uniquely abundant in jejunum and ileum of adult mice, but they are absent or occur only at low levels in the duodenum, colon, stomach, and all other mouse organs examined. Low-molecular-weight mRNAs begin accumulating in the small bowel at approximately 3 wk of age, coinciding with weaning and with profound changes in intestinal differentiation. One complementary deoxyribonucleic acid clone of a low-molecular-weight mRNA (asb4/134) is specific to the distal small bowel, specifically accumulates at weaning, and hybridizes to RNA from mouse testis and brain at approximately 2%-5% of the intestinal level. Low-molecular-weight mRNA sequences may provide important markers of intestinal differentiation at the genetic level, leading to a better understanding of the factors that contribute to its postnatal maturation.\r"

Both continuous and intermittent infusion of secretin increased half-emptying time, by 133% and 55%, respectively. The plasma secretin concentration in condition 1 was 0.8 pM; plateau concentration in condition 2 was 9.8 pM; and integrated mean concentration in condition 3 was 4.8 pM.

  ".W": "BW 942C is a novel enkephalinlike pentapeptide that has been shown to have antidiarrheal action in model systems. The effect of BW 942C on rabbit ileal electrolyte transport was studied to gain insight into the mechanism of the antidiarrheal action of opiate-like compounds. Multiple effects were observed, differing with the basal state of the tissue. BW 942C increased Na absorption in tissues that were not absorbing in the basal state, whereas it had little effect on Na absorption in tissues that were previously absorbing at moderate to high rates (greater than 1 microEq/h.cm2. It increased Cl absorption and caused a dose-related decrease in short-circuit current in all tissues. This effect was reversed or inhibited by naloxone (10(-5) M), suggesting that it is mediated by opiate receptors. No significant change in residual flux was noted. BW 942C was effective from both the serosal and mucosal side; however, it required a 2-log higher dose on the mucosal side (10(-4) M, maximal) to achieve a response similar to that observed with serosal application (10(-6) M, maximal). The ability of BW 942C to alter stimulated secretion was studied using theophylline, prostaglandin E2, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and bethanechol. There was significantly less Cl secretion in BW 942C-treated tissues than in control tissues after stimulation with prostaglandin E2 (10(-7) M). However, this effect was not apparent at higher doses of prostaglandin E2 and there was no inhibition of the short-circuit current response to any of the secretory stimuli by BW 942C. Loperamide was also found to be unable to inhibit the Cl secretion or change in short-circuit current stimulated by theophylline. Although opiates have been shown to be moderately effective antidiarrheal agents, their ability to influence mucosal electrolyte transport is weak and may only account for part of their antidiarrheal action.\r"

A positive correlation (p less than 0.05) was found between the release of cholecystokinin and pancreatic protein output in both control (r = 0.68) and peptide YY-treated (r = 0.67) groups. Release of peptide YY was significant after intraduodenal or intracolonic administration of sodium oleate. These studies demonstrate that inhibition of pancreatic protein secretion by peptide YY in dogs is mediated, at least in part, by an inhibition of the release of cholecystokinin.\r"

  ".W": "The central nervous system action of calcitonin to influence various experimental models of gastric ulcers and gastric function was studied in rats fasted for 24 h. Intracisternal injection of salmon calcitonin (5 micrograms) completely suppressed gastric ulcerations induced by exposure to cold restraint stress, intracisternal injection of a stable thyrotropin-releasing hormone analogue, or peroral administration of aspirin. By contrast, intracisternal calcitonin enhanced gastric lesions elicited by peroral administration of 40% ethanol or 0.6 N HCl. Calcitonin action was dose-dependent (0.01-1 microgram) and central nervous system mediated inasmuch as intravenous calcitonin, given at a dose 50-fold higher than that effective intracisternally, did not significantly modify gastric mucosal injuries elicited by aspirin or ethanol. Intracisternal injection of calcitonin at 0.01 microgram inhibited gastric acid output by 90% in pylorus-ligated rats and suppressed gastric emptying of a liquid meal by 63%-94% in doses ranging from 0.01 to 5 micrograms. Prostaglandin generation in the gastric mucosa was not modified by intracisternal injection of calcitonin. These results demonstrate that intracisternal calcitonin acts within the brain to potently prevent ulcer formation elicited by stress, thyrotropin-releasing hormone analogue, or aspirin, but is not cytoprotective against necrotizing agents. Calcitonin action is not related to modification of gastric prostaglandin generation but it may involve the inhibition of gastric secretory and motor function.\r"

The mechanisms of alcoholic liver disease, although mostly unknown, do involve ethanol metabolism. This study examined the ability of fat-storing cells to metabolize ethanol. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity was detected in fat-storing cells of the rat liver. The enzyme was demonstrated also by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical staining. The enzyme in fat-storing cells is similar to the hepatocyte enzyme in its Michaelis-Menten constants for substrates and coenzymes and in the competitive inhibition by ethanol of retinol oxidation. It differs from the hepatocyte enzyme by its greater susceptibility to inhibition by 4-methylpyrazole and by having a single isoelectric point of 9.5 as compared with multiple isoelectric points in the hepatocyte ranging from 6.9 to 8.8. The ability of the fat-storing cell to oxidize ethanol and the inhibitory effect of ethanol on retinol oxidation may be important in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.\r"

After a basal period on a controlled diet, bile acids alone were administered (300-900 mg) daily for 9 days, followed by cholestyramine (12 g) plus bile acids (900 mg) daily for 7 days, and cholestyramine alone (12 g) daily for 6 days. There was no substantial change in either the red blood cell or plasma protoporphyrin concentrations during any treatment period. However, cholestyramine and cholestyramine combined with bile acids caused a threefold increase in fecal protoporphyrin excretion, whereas bile acids alone had no effect in this regard. After 1 yr of cholestyramine therapy, fecal excretion of protoporphyrin remained elevated with concurrent improvement in liver function tests and photosensitivity. This study indicates that cholestyramine but not bile acids can substantially increase protoporphyrin excretion and therefore may be capable of ameliorating the hepatotoxicity that may occur in selected patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria.\r"

Hamartomatous polyps were identical to those found in the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. However, in 1 patient they included neural structures and in another there were angiomatous and adipous structures in addition to colitis cystica profunda. Two patients with hamartomatous polyps had normal intelligence and no clinical neurologic symptoms. The evaluation of one kindred revealed the association of hamartomatous polyps of the colon with forme fruste of tuberous sclerosis in different members, but none had the typical disease. Tuberous sclerosis should thus be considered in the differential diagnosis of hamartomatous colonic polyps. Conversely, colonic endoscopy may be a useful adjunctive test in the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis, particularly in the incomplete varieties of disease.\r"

Cholestasis initially located in the region of the hepatic venule came to be associated with the progressive development of portal tract lesions consisting of inflammatory infiltration, fibrosis, and disappearance of interlobular bile ducts. Amitriptyline hydroxylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation are deficient in subjects with the poor metabolizer phenotype of debrisoquine. Drug oxidation phenotyping with dextromethorphan showed that this patient had the extensive metabolizer phenotype. This observation demonstrates that amitriptyline can induce prolonged cholestasis and suggests that the susceptibility to develop liver injury while taking this drug may not be related to a genetic deficiency of its hydroxylation.\r"

In a prospective longitudinal study, the type, intensity, and distribution of inflammation in antral biopsy specimens were correlated with the presence of C. pyloridis. Campylobacter pyloridis was cultured from antral biopsy specimens in 98% of the ulcer patients, 70% of the nonulcer dyspepsia patients, and 20% of the asymptomatic volunteers. The dependency of chronic active gastritis on the presence of C. pyloridis was shown by an association of gastritis with positive culture and healing of gastritis with negative culture after various therapeutic regimens. Spontaneous disappearance of C. pyloridis never occurred. Colloidal bismuth subcitrate, amoxicillin, and the combination of colloidal bismuth subcitrate and amoxicillin were effective therapies in eradicating C. pyloridis. Recolonization with the same bacterial subtype and recurrence of gastritis frequently occurred within 1 mo after initial eradication. In this study we demonstrate ultimate normalization of gastric mucosa after successful eradication of C. pyloridis. Especially complete normalization of gastric mucosa after amoxicillin monotherapy provides additional strong evidence for a true cause-effect relationship between C. pyloridis colonization and gastritis.\r"

Four peptides derived from chymotryptic digestion covered the N-terminal sequence through residue 68. These peptides were tested for toxicity in celiac disease by organ culture of biopsied small intestinal tissues taken from patients with active celiac disease. Enterocyte height was used as a measure of peptide effect on cultured tissues. Five of seven peptides tested significantly inhibited increase of enterocyte height in the cultures and were considered toxic on this basis. The largest common sequences among the toxic peptides were -pro-ser-gln-gln- and -gln-gln-gln-pro-; these sequences were absent from the nontoxic peptides. The relationship of these sequences to the damaging effect of gliadins on the small intestinal mucosa in celiac disease remains to be investigated.\r"

As these operations impair the grinding and sieving of solid food, we sought to determine the effect of vagotomy and antrectomy on fat absorption from solid (e.g., liver) as compared with liquid (e.g., margarine) dietary sources in the proximal small intestine. Midgut fistulas were placed in 13 dogs; 7 were controls and 6 underwent concurrent vagotomy and antrectomy. To label solid fat, the livers of live chickens were labeled with intravenous [14C]triolein and [3H]glycerol triether, an absorbable and nonabsorbable fat label, respectively. For the liquid fat label, these markers were mixed with margarine. A standard meal of steak, liver, bread, margarine, and water, with either the liver or margarine fat labeled, was fed and the midgut effluent was sieved and centrifuged to obtain four phases: large particles (greater than 0.5 mm), small particles (less than 0.5 mm), aqueous, and oil, which were extracted and counted for 14C and 3H. The ratio of 14C to 3H in each fraction was used to determine how much fat was absorbed from each phase of chyme. With liver fat labeled, 48.3% +/- 8.1% of the [3H]glycerol triether remained in large particles after vagotomy and antrectomy compared with 3.1% +/- 1.0% in controls at midintestine (p less than 0.001). After vagotomy and antrectomy, more than half of the liver fat (solid fat) was malabsorbed (57.1% +/- 6.5% vs. 23.1% +/- 6.6% malabsorbed, p less than 0.01, vagotomy and antrectomy vs. controls), whereas fat absorption from margarine (liquid fat) was not reduced compared with controls (8.8% +/- 2.5% vs. 13.6% +/- 5.5% malabsorbed, p greater than 0.05, vagotomy and antrectomy vs. controls). These observations indicate that by reducing gastric trituration and releasing large particles of poorly digested food into the intestine, vagotomy and antrectomy impairs the absorption of fat selectively from solid, but not from liquid, dietary sources.\r"

A developmental increase in the hydrophobicity of the luminal surface of the gastric mucosa was recorded between the first and third weeks of life. The hydrophobicity of the stomach was not consistently influenced by an acute administration of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (5 micrograms/kg, 30 min before examination) until the end of the third week of life, at which time a significant 40% increase was recorded. Similarly, the decrease in surface hydrophobicity that resulted from luminal administration of an ulcerogenic dose of HCl (0.6 N, 6 ml/kg) was blocked by 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 only in 3-wk-old rats and not in rats 1 and 2 wk of age. Neither the normal developmental increase nor the 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2-induced enhancement in gastric surface hydrophobicity was induced precociously by corticosterone or thyroxine. The possible importance of these findings on the development of gastric surface hydrophobicity to the ontogeny of both gastric barrier function and prostaglandin-induced gastric protection is discussed.\r"

Using a sensitive and specific electroimmunoassay for the intestinal isoenzyme, 26 of 42 serum samples were positive, compared with 3 of 25 samples obtained from hospitalized patients with elevated phosphatase activity. The fractional amount of this isoenzyme was also higher, ranging from 1.5% to 41% of the total serum phosphatase, compared with 0.1%-1.2% in control sera. Kidneys removed during transplantation or postmortem contained a membranous phosphatase with immunologic activity identical to the intestinal isoenzyme in 5 of 6 patients. This enzyme accounted for 8%-21% of the total kidney phosphatase activity. By morphology the immunoreaction was localized to the apical membranes of the collecting tubules. Thus, the kidney is the likely source of the observed increase in serum intestinal-type phosphatase activity noted in patients with chronic renal failure. An elevation in the intestinal isoenzyme rather than the presence of early metabolic bone disease or hepatic disease should be considered in renal failure patients with mildly elevated (up to 50% over normal) total serum alkaline phosphatase.\r"

The results were compared with those of adult rats previously reported by us using the same intestinal preparation. Transport of biotin was linear for 20 min of incubation in all age groups. Transport of biotin was significantly (p less than 0.05) lower in the jejunum than the ileum of suckling rats but was not significantly different in the jejunum and the ileum of weanling rats. In adult rats, biotin transport was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher in the jejunum than the ileum. In all age groups, transport of biotin in the jejunum was saturable at low concentrations (less than 10 microM) but linear at high concentrations. The apparent Km and Vmax of the saturable process showed a progressive increase from suckling to weanling to adult rats (apparent Km of 0.63, 2.49, and 3.37 microM; Vmax of 18.3, 44.7, and 124.4 pmol/g.min, respectively). On the other hand, the rate of transport by the nonsaturable process showed a progressive decrease with maturation (143.8, 111.6, and 87.5 pmol/g.min for suckling, weanling, and adult rats, respectively). Transport of biotin in suckling and weanling rats was similar to that of adult rats in that it was Na+-, energy-, and temperature-dependent and inhibited by structural analogues. These results demonstrate that biotin transport undergoes clear maturational changes. These changes include a decrease in the affinity and an increase in the activity (and/or the numbers) of the transport carrier, a decrease in the rate of transport by the nonsaturable process, and a change in the preferential site of transport.\r"

In this study, we undertook to define the effect of commonly observed peristaltic dysfunction on volume clearance by obtaining concurrent videofluoroscopic and manometric recordings in patients with nonobstructive dysphagia or heartburn. Excellent correlation existed between the findings from the two studies. A single normal peristaltic wave resulted in 100% clearance of a barium bolus from the esophagus. At each recording site, luminal closure, as demonstrated by videofluoroscopy, coincided with the upstroke of the peristaltic pressure complex. Absent or incomplete peristaltic contractions invariably resulted in little or no volume clearance from the involved segment. Regional hypotensive peristalsis was associated with incomplete volume clearance by the mechanism of retrograde escape of barium through the region of hypotensive contraction. The regional peristaltic amplitude required to prevent retrograde escape of barium was greater in the distal compared with the proximal esophagus. The mean peristaltic amplitude associated with instances of retrograde escape was 25 mmHg in the distal esophagus compared with 12 mmHg in the proximal esophageal segments. Thus, the peristaltic dysfunction commonly seen in patients with esophagitis (failed and hypotensive peristalsis) likely leads to impaired volume clearance.\r"

The preoperative diagnoses were defined with an endoscopic biopsy protocol in which specimens were taken with large-channel biopsy forceps at least every 2 cm throughout the length of Barrett's epithelium. Final pathologic diagnoses derived from detailed analysis of the resected specimens confirmed high-grade dysplasia without carcinoma in 4 patients and intramucosal carcinoma in 2 patients. The remaining 2 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of intramucosal carcinoma had focal submucosal invasion by carcinoma in the resected specimens, but no involvement of the muscularis propria or adventitial lymph nodes. Because the natural history of high-grade dysplasia is not known, the decision to operate on patients with this lesion must be carefully weighed and individualized for each patient. Two of our patients who underwent esophageal resection for high-grade dysplasia without cancer died, one immediately postoperatively and the other 9 mo later after a postoperative stroke. Once intramucosal carcinoma is documented, surgery should be considered if the patient is an acceptable operative risk. We conclude that systematic preoperative endoscopic biopsy of intact mucosa in Barrett's esophagus can correctly detect high-grade dysplasia, either alone or in combination with early, treatable adenocarcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "We report the results of an analysis of information from a prospective cohort study of women examining the association between cholecystectomy and use of supplemental estrogens (never, current, and past use). There were 55 cases of cholecystectomy in those who had never used estrogen and 105 cases in those who had ever used estrogen. After adjustment for age, the relative risk of cholecystectomy in those who had ever used estrogen was 2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.5-3.0). In women classified as current users based on information available in 1977, the relative risk of gallbladder disease was 2.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.8-4.0) and in past users as of this date, it was 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.5). When cases known to have reinitiated estrogen use after 1977 are removed from the numerator for past users and added to the numerator for current users, the relative estimate for past use decreased to 1.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.7-1.8), and the risk estimate for current use increased to 3.9 (95% confidence interval, 2.6-5.9). Although an increase in the risk of gallbladder disease in women using supplemental estrogens has been consistently observed in previous studies, the risk after cessation of use has received little attention but could be important. Our data suggest the possibility that the risk of gallbladder disease in estrogen users persists after use of the drug ceases. An increase in the risk of cholecystectomy in estrogen users that persists after drug use ends is plausible if estrogen-induced increases in the lithogenicity of bile cause gallstones to form during drug use and if these gallstones fail to dissolve even after bile lithogenicity returns to normal upon cessation of use. The effect of estrogen use on the gallbladder should be considered in weighing the net risk-benefit ratio of these drugs.\r"

Acid secretion was stimulated by an intravenous infusion of 21 pmol/kg.h of gastrin 17 or by intragastric instillation of peptone; gastric acid output during simultaneous infusion of 325 pmol/kg.h of the glycine-extended 5-17 fragment or 319 pmol/kg.h of the 1-13 fragment was then compared with acid output during infusion of saline. Neither the glycine-extended 5-17 fragment nor the 1-13 fragment of gastrin 17 influenced gastric acid secretion. By gel and ion-exchange chromatography of serum drawn during infusion, the infused peptide was recovered at the position of the intact synthetic peptide. The disappearance curve of circulating glycine-extended gastrin could be described by two components with half-lives of 3.6 and 48 min. As the glycine-extended fragment was stable in serum or plasma in vitro for 1 h at 37 degrees C, the rapid elimination observed in vivo cannot be ascribed to circulating plasma enzymes.\r"

The major collagen type in control intestine was type I (68%), followed by types III (20%) and V (12%). In strictured intestine both collagen content and the relative amount of type V collagen were significantly increased compared with control intestine. Histologic studies demonstrated that in strictured specimens there was a striking proliferation of smooth muscle cells of the muscularis mucosae associated with an accumulation of collagen in the submucosa. The thickness of the muscularis propria was also increased. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated small amounts of type V collagen in the submucosa of control bowel. In contrast, large amounts of type V collagen were seen in the fibrotic, expanded submucosa of strictured bowel, particularly in the areas where smooth muscle cells of the muscularis mucosae had proliferated. Intestinal strictures in Crohn's disease are therefore characterized by an accumulation of collagen, a proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and an increase in type V collagen, a collagen type produced in relatively large amounts by smooth muscle cells. These changes appear to result in both a loss of the normal compliance of the intestine and a thickening of the intestine wall, resulting ultimately in the intestinal obstruction so frequently seen in patients with Crohn's disease.\r"

This study was designed to determine the role of the adrenergic pathway in the PYY-induced inhibition of pancreatic secretion. After intravenous administration of PYY, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of pancreatic HCO3 and protein responses to secretin, cholecystokinin, and feeding in conscious dogs and a reduction in pancreatic blood flow in anesthetized animals. These inhibitory effects of PYY on pancreatic secretion and blood flow were abolished in the presence of combined phentolamine and propranolol. Ileal perfusion with oleate caused a rise in plasma PYY levels similar to that observed after intravenous infusion of exogenous PYY. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade also antagonized the effects of ileal perfusion with oleate on hormonal and postprandial pancreatic secretion. We conclude that exogenous PYY or endogenous PYY released by ileal oleate inhibits pancreatic secretory responses to exogenous secretin, cholecystokinin, or a meal and causes pancreatic vasoconstriction. Both these effects are mediated, at least in part, by the adrenergic pathway.\r"

Vitamin B12 absorption and intrinsic factor in the stomach extract decreased compared with those in AIG-negative control groups. No decrease of the serum A/G ratio in AIG-bearing mice was observed. Although development of anemia, as evaluated by a decrease in hematocrit value, was poor until 12 mo of age and the gastric mucosa was hypertrophic, the AIG resembled human pernicious anemia rather than Menetrier's disease. Adoptive transfer of spleen cells, but not sera, of AIG-bearing nu/+ into BALB/c nu/nu mice caused AIG in all animals 1 mo later, indicating the involvement of lymphocytes in the induction mechanism of AIG. Cytofluorometric and immunohistochemical analysis of lymphocytes in the gastric mucosa revealed T-cell infiltration at an early stage (1.5-3 mo) followed by B cell infiltration (6 mo). When the fraction enriched with parietal cells, which were intensively stained with sera of AIG-bearing mice and fluorescent antibody to mouse immunoglobulin G, was injected into the foot pads of AIG-bearing nude mice, typical delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction was observed in all animals. This was not seen in the mice injected with the cell fraction enriched with chief cells, although a few of them were stained by the immunofluorescent technique. Thus, the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction seems to be directly involved in the mechanism of tissue damage.\r"

The 7 patients with a vagotomy but no gastric resection were symptom-free and had no mucosal disease. Of 9 patients with a partial gastrectomy, 7 had mucosal disease, with or without symptoms, and 6 of the 7 patients had acid outputs of 5-10 mEq/h. In these patients, antisecretory medication was increased to reduce output to less than 5 mEq/h and symptoms and mucosal abnormalities resolved in each patient. Patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and a vagotomy can be treated safely by reducing acid secretion to less than 10 mEq/h, but in patients with a partial gastrectomy, acid secretion must be reduced to less than 5 mEq/h, and adequacy of therapy must be checked further by endoscopy.\r"

Decreased concentrations of vasoactive intestinal peptide (707 +/- 112 ng/g wet tissue) and peptide histidine-methionine (543 +/- 58 ng/g) were found in the muscularis externa obtained from constipated patients compared with normal concentrations (40 patients) of vasoactive intestinal peptide (1199 +/- 47 ng/g) and peptide histidine-methionine (815 +/- 45 ng/g). Vasoactive intestinal peptide was identified by immunocytochemistry in nerve fibers within the circular smooth muscle layer of descending colon obtained from 6 control patients, but not in nerve fibers within the circular smooth muscle of descending colon obtained from 3 patients with idiopathic chronic constipation. By contrast, the distribution of immunoreactive met5-enkephalin was similar in normal descending colon and in descending colon obtained from patients with idiopathic chronic constipation. Decreased colonic concentrations of vasoactive intestinal peptide (a candidate nonadrenergic, noncholinergic inhibitory neurotransmitter) may be associated with diminution of inhibitory innervation of colonic circular smooth muscle in some patients with idiopathic chronic constipation.\r"

Pancreatic secretion was assessed by a marker perfusion technique and plasma secretin concentrations were assessed by a specific radioimmunoassay. Increasing doses of either human or porcine secretin produced increasing bicarbonate output (p less than 0.01), whereas trypsin and lipase were not stimulated over basal. The highest doses of secretin induced a significant increase in pancreatic amylase secretion. The two secretin preparations were found to be equipotent with respect to pancreatic secretion and plasma kinetics. Significant increases of plasma secretin were observed after a steak meal in 15 volunteers (p less than 0.001). When human secretin was infused at postprandial concentrations, significant increases in pancreatic bicarbonate output were observed (p less than 0.05). We conclude (a) that the substitution of two amino acids in human secretin does not affect biologic activity and plasma metabolism of the compound; (b) secretin does not stimulate pancreatic enzyme secretion at physiologic concentrations; and (c) the stimulatory effects of secretin on pancreatic amylase remain to be elucidated. The study suggests that human secretin is a true hormone.\r"

Perfusion of the lumen with exogenous acid (80-480 nmol/min) caused an increase in somatostatin secretion in proportion to the increase in luminal acidity. The increase in somatostatin secretion was resistant to tetrodotoxin and attained maximal levels (61.6% +/- 8.7% above basal level) similar to those elicited by maximal doses of secretagogues. Conversely, neutralization of basal acid secretion with bicarbonate (20-160 nmol/min) caused a decrease in somatostatin secretion in proportion to the decrease in luminal acidity. Similarly, neutralization of the secretagogue-induced increments in acid secretion with bicarbonate or inhibition of the increments with cimetidine abolished the corresponding increments in somatostatin secretion. It is proposed that acid-induced release of somatostatin in proximity to parietal cells serves as a negative feedback mechanism restraining acid secretion.\r"

Psychopathology in general, personality features of hostility, irritability, and hypersensitivity, and impaired coping ability (low ego strength) each correlated significantly with serum pepsinogen concentration in ulcer patients (p less than or equal to 0.005). Cigarette smoking and intake of alcohol and aspirin were increased in ulcer patients but unrelated to psychopathology. Depression was the variable that best discriminated ulcer patients from nonulcer controls; a negative perception of life events, number of relatives with ulcer, and serum pepsinogen I concentration also had a major, unique discriminating value, whereas smoking played a relatively minor role independent of the other variables examined. Our study supports the concept that several interacting factors (psychologic, behavioral, and genetic/physiologic) are likely involved in peptic ulcer disease. Emotional stress may predispose to ulcers by producing gastric hypersecretion, as manifested by hyperpepsinogenemia.\r"

These observations have prompted us to develop an animal model of aberrantly distributed normal surface antigens in colonic carcinoma. We prepared four monoclonal antibodies, three of which react specifically with antigens located on the microvillus surface and one that reacts specifically with the laterobasal surface of normal rat colonocytes. Three of the four cell-surface antigens were expressed by cells at all levels of the colonic crypt, but one of the microvillar antigens (p66) was expressed only on the mature colonocytes at the luminal surface. We then documented that a microvillus antigen (p66) detected by one of the antibodies and a laterobasal membrane antigen detected by another antibody were expressed over the entire surface of poorly differentiated colonic carcinoma cells induced by dimethylhydrazine. p66 was more often expressed on poorly differentiated colonic cancers than were the other three antigens. These observations indicate that (a) polarity of surface membrane antigens is a characteristic of normal rat colonic epithelial cells, (b) this polarity is not present in some experimental colonic carcinomas, and (c) the malignant phenotype of colonic carcinoma cells does not result merely from a block in normal differentiation of colonocytes.\r"

We raised monoclonal antibodies to villin and used them to localize it in human ileum and colon and in 22 colonic neoplasms. Villin is localized in the brush border of normal ileum and in the luminal border of normal colon and is expressed with increasing staining intensity as cells migrate from crypt to surface. It was present in the luminal border in all five adenomas and in 16 of 17 adenocarcinomas studied. In addition, villin staining was observed in the cytoplasm of 10 tumors, and in the basement membrane area surrounding tumor in 10 cases. In \"transitional\" mucosa adjacent to carcinomas it was confined to the luminal border. Abnormal expression of villin by a significant proportion of colonic tumors suggests that it may have a role as a marker of colorectal neoplasia.\r"

We observed specific binding of 125I-heat-stable enterotoxin to all small intestinal and colonic specimens. However, a greater number of receptors per microgram of membrane protein were present in infants and the number of receptors rapidly decreased with increasing age. We also observed that increased heat-stable enterotoxin stimulation of guanylate cyclase was correlated with increased receptor density. We suggest that a greater number of gastrointestinal receptors for heat-stable enterotoxin, capable of activating more guanylate cyclase, may contribute to the increased severity of diarrhea noted in young children exposed to enterotoxigenic E. coli.\r"

Age-standardized morbidity rates for women have not changed significantly during the period 1970-1980 (p = 0.97), which was also characteristic of each of the eight age-specific morbidity rates studied (p greater than 0.40).\r"

During the follow-up period of 9-23 yr, 486 patients (19.2%) died, 2025 (80.1%) were alive, and the fate of 18 (0.7%) was unknown. No significant differences were found between these numbers and the numbers expected from the sex- and age-matched general population at 1-20 yr after the initial diagnosis for patients with gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, or both gastric and duodenal ulcer, or for all ulcer groups combined. The survival rate for the surgically treated patients did not differ from the expected survival rate. The number of deaths from peptic ulcer (observed/expected = 18/5.47) was statistically high and the number from cerebrovascular disease was significantly low. Our results show that for patients with a peptic ulcer, the prognosis relative to life span is as good as that of the general population and surgery has little influence on the prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "A family history of colorectal cancer is believed to place persons at increased risk for development of the disease. It is unclear, however, how \"strong\" a family history must be to increase this risk or to make colonoscopic screening appropriate. We performed initial colonoscopy in 154 asymptomatic subjects whose only suspected risk factor was one or two first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer; 48 of these subjects also had affected second- and third-degree relatives. We found 45 adenomas in 28 subjects (18%). One subject had a 3-cm villous adenoma. In 6 subjects, the most advanced findings were tubular adenomas 5-9 mm in diameter; in 21 subjects, we found only tubular adenomas that were 2-4 mm in diameter. The prevalence of adenomas increased significantly with age of subjects (p less than 0.01). Although the overall prevalence of colorectal neoplasms in our group was no greater than might be expected in the general population, subjects with two first-degree relatives tended to have more diminutive adenomas than those with one such relative. Our findings suggest that colonoscopy is not an appropriate first step in screening persons with one affected first-degree relative. For those with more complex family histories, more data are needed--particularly on the prevalence of advanced neoplasms--to determine whether a screening technique that is less costly and less invasive than colonoscopy may be adequate.\r"

The effect of intravenous administration of somatostatin at 0, 12.5, 50, 100, and 200 pmol/kg.h was investigated and related to the effect of intragastric administration of 100 ml of vegetable oil. Plasma somatostatinlike immunoreactivity was elevated during intravenous administration of somatostatin at 100 and 200 pmol/kg.h, whereas no increase was detected in response to the oil. Somatostatin infusion at 100 and 200 pmol/kg.h significantly inhibited the acid secretion by 25% and 65%, and the oil reduced the acid output by 41%. Somatostatin at 100 and 200 pmol/kg.h significantly enhanced gastric emptying, whereas the oil inhibited gastric emptying. These observations suggest that somatostatin may not be an important hormonal messenger of fat-induced inhibition of acid secretion or gastric emptying.\r"

  ".U": "88084276\r", 
  ".W": "The lamina propria of colonic mucosa normally contains eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and a few neutrophils. If the number of such cells is judged to be increased, colonic inflammation is said to be present. However, the number of cells present in normal mucosa has not been clearly established. Mild abnormalities are difficult to identify, yet might be associated with colonic dysfunction. We therefore developed a morphometric point-counting method to quantitatively analyze the areas occupied by different structures in the mucosa of the human colon. A computer was used to move a dot in a rectilinear pattern over the X400 magnified image of biopsy specimens obtained from throughout the colon by colonoscopy. The structure on which the dot landed was identified and tabulated by a pathologist. In preliminary studies, we established counting parameters that would yield the most representative results. Based on statistical analysis, it was decided to count 98 points in each of seven regions of six biopsy specimens, i.e., over 4000 points per subject. Results were expressed as percentages of counts landing on a given item, and represented the area of the biopsy specimen covered by that item. Using this method, we determined the range of normal in healthy volunteers. The sensitivity of this method was tested by studying patients with chronic diarrhea previously diagnosed as having or not having mild to moderate mucosal inflammation. In the patient group, colonic fluid absorption measured by a perfusion technique was directly correlated with epithelial cell counts and inversely correlated with lamina propria cellularity and with the counts of lamina propria neutrophils and plasma cells. We conclude that morphometric analysis of colon biopsy specimens can be used to quantitate histologic features of colonic mucosa and to accurately identify even mild abnormalities, and that it can be a useful clinical research tool.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to clarify the issue of whether feedback regulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion occurs in humans. A naturally occurring inhibitor of trypsin and chymotrypsin, the Bowman-Birk inhibitor of soybeans, was used to reduce the activities of these enzymes normally secreted by the pancreas into the duodenum. Pure pancreatic juice was collected by endoscopic retrograde cannulation of the pancreatic duct in a protocol consisting of three periods: period 1 (15 min), collections of juice without return to the duodenum (\"washout phase\"); period 2 (35 min), intraduodenal infusion of juice to which buffered saline or heat-inactivated Bowman-Birk inhibitor had been added; and period 3 (55 min), intraduodenal infusion of juice in which greater than 90% of the trypsin and chymotrypsin activities had been abolished by treatment with the active inhibitor. Control experiments were included in which untreated juice was infused in period 3 as well as period 2. Enzyme analyses (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and amylase) of samples of juice collected at 5-min intervals revealed a twofold to threefold increase in the output and concentration of all four enzymes in period 3 compared with period 2. These results thus confirm the existence of feedback control in humans.\r"

Pancreatic juice was collected at 60-min intervals from 10 AM to 7 PM, starting 2 h before and ending 7 h after lunch, and was analyzed for volume, bicarbonate content, and protein content. Large doses of pancreatic extract were given between and during meals. Both bicarbonate and protein output increased rapidly after the beginning of the meal and the increase persisted, with minor fluctuations, for the entire 7-h study period between lunch and dinner. The peak postprandial bicarbonate and protein outputs were higher (on average by 20% and 26%, respectively) than bicarbonate and protein outputs induced by exogenous infusion of submaximal doses of secretin and cerulein. The profile and magnitude of the bicarbonate secretory pattern elicited by food were not substantially different from those of protein secretion. In an additional patient who had undergone a duodenocephalopancreatectomy plus two-thirds distal gastrectomy before the study, the pancreatic response to meals showed an initial phase characterized by an increase in pancreatic secretion during the first postprandial hour followed by a tendency to decrease in the subsequent 2 h, and a later phase (from the fourth postprandial hour to the end of the study) characterized by a more marked and more persistent increase in pancreatic secretion than occurred in the initial 3 h. These data indicate that (a) the pancreatic secretory response to ordinary meals is much more prolonged than is generally believed. The late phase of the response is not dependent on gastric emptying of food into the duodenum, but is probably related to the arrival of chyme in the distal ileum. (b) The pancreatic secretory response to a normal meal is quantitatively slightly higher than that produced by exogenous pancreatic stimulation with submaximal doses of secretin and cerulein. (c) The pattern of postprandial bicarbonate secretion is similar to that for protein.\r"

A continuous pattern of IgA deposition along hepatic sinusoids proved to be the best diagnostic feature, combining a specificity of 0.91 with a sensitivity of 0.75. Although serum IgA has a specificity of 0.78, its diagnostic value is restricted by a sensitivity of 0.50, making it not superior to serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Furthermore, serum IgA proved to be related to liver histopathology. High levels of serum IgA are found in hepatitis and cirrhosis, without significant differences between alcoholic and nonalcoholic patients. However, in the case of mild histopathologic changes in the liver, such as steatosis and fibrosis, significantly higher serum IgA concentrations are found in alcoholic than in nonalcoholic liver disease.\r"

Iliac crest bone biopsy showed no patient with osteoporosis, and mild osteomalacic changes in 1 patient. Slight elevations in appositional rate, osteoid volume, and resorption surface were compatible with a state of high bone turnover. Photon absorptiometry revealed a low forearm bone mineral content in 3 of 25 patients, calcium absorption was below normal in 14 of 24 patients, and there was evidence of fat malabsorption in 11 of 25 patients. Five patients also had low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Thus, little evidence of significant metabolic bone disease was found in this group by these methods, but abnormalities were seen, such as poor calcium absorption, that may predispose to its later development.\r"

Red blood cell centerline velocity, measured in first-order arterioles, was significantly higher in portal hypertensive rats (24.3 +/- 1.2 mm/s vs. 19.6 +/- 1.3 mm/s), yet there was no significant change in the diameters of these vessels. Microvascular pressures and diameters of first- and second-order arterioles were not different between control and portal hypertensive rats. However, both pressure (34.3 +/- 2.7 mmHg vs. 28.0 +/- 1.8 mmHg) and diameter (30.4 +/- 0.6 microns vs. 21.4 +/- 2.1 microns) were significantly increased in the third-order arterioles of portal hypertensive rats. A consistent elevation in pressure was observed throughout the distal segments (capillaries to first-order venules) of the intestinal microcirculation of portal hypertensive rats. The results of these studies indicate that the increased intestinal vascular pressures associated with chronic portal hypertension result from a combination of reduced arteriolar resistance and venous congestion.\r"

  ".W": "Galactose clearance, measured during low galactose infusion and calculated as infusion rate divided by peripheral galactose concentration (systemic clearance), has been proposed as a measure of liver blood flow. This requires nearly complete hepatic extraction as well as negligible extrahepatic elimination. The purpose of the study was to examine if these assumptions are fulfilled in subjects with no liver disease, and to compare the galactose clearance measurement with an independent measurement of liver blood flow. Liver blood flow was measured in 6 subjects by means of a constant indocyanine green infusion, indocyanine green concentration measurements in a peripheral artery and a hepatic vein, and calculation according to Fick's principle. The mean (+/- SEM) blood flow rate was 1.2 +/- 0.1 L/min. Galactose was given at a constant infusion rate of 142 +/- 10 mumol/min, and steady-state concentrations were measured in the peripheral artery (A) and the hepatic vein (V). The hepatic extraction fraction [(A - V)/A] was 0.91 +/- 0.03. The hepatic galactose elimination rate [(A - V) X flow] was 101 +/- 12 mumol/min; this is about two-thirds of the total elimination rate (viz., infusion rate). Urinary excretion was negligible. This indicates an extrahepatic galactose elimination of approximately 41 mumol/min. Systemic galactose clearance, calculated as mentioned above, was 1.5 +/- 0.1 L blood/min. It was significantly higher than the liver blood flow in each subject (paired t-test, each p less than 0.02), on average 133% of the flow. Thus the systemic galactose clearance value overestimates liver blood flow, probably due to a small, but in this context quantitatively important, extrahepatic galactose elimination.\r"

Mean follow-up was 12.8 +/- 14.2 mo (mean +/- SD). A total of 38 variables based on history, physical examination, hepatic biochemical tests, renal function tests, and endogenous vasoactive systems were analyzed for prognostic value. Eighteen of these variables had prognostic value in the univariate analysis. A multivariate analysis (Cox's regression method) disclosed that 7 of these 18 variables had independent prognostic value. Of these independent predictors of survival, mean arterial pressure and plasma norepinephrine concentration were the variables that best predicted prognosis. Two other variables that independently correlated with survival were urinary sodium excretion and glomerular filtration rate. The remaining three independent predictors of survival were nutritional status, hepatomegaly, and serum albumin concentration. Therefore, these findings indicate that, in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, parameters estimating systemic hemodynamics and renal function are better predictors of survival than those routinely used to estimate hepatic function.\r"

  ".U": "88084289\r", 
  ".W": "Hepatic sulfation is thought to promote fecal excretion of lithocholate in humans by impairing the enterohepatic recirculation of the compound. Sulfatases produced by the gut flora may, at least in part, counteract this process. To investigate this interaction, female germfree rats, which are known to excrete considerable amounts of sulfated bile salts, were selectively associated with a bile salt desulfating flora. In these rats nearly all cecal, colonic, and fecal bile salt sulfate esters were hydrolyzed, resulting in a decrease of total fecal bile salt excretion of greater than 25% compared with gnotobiotic rats without a bile salt desulfating flora. Desulfation of allochenodeoxycholate, the major sulfated bile salt in germfree rats, led to an enhanced recirculation and 12 alpha-hydroxylation of the compound in the liver, resulting in an increased fecal output of allocholate. Microbial desulfation of intraperitoneally injected [24-14C]taurolithocholate-3-sulfate caused a fivefold decrease of the fecal plus urinary excretion rate of the isotope to approximately that found for unsulfated [24-14C]taurolithocholate. Coassociation of the gnotobiotic rats with a microflora that normalized the small intestinal transit time and cecal size led to a rise of total fecal bile salt excretion of greater than 30% and a twofold accelerated excretion of both sulfated and unsulfated injected [24-14C]taurolithocholate. We conclude that in rats the gut flora rapidly desulfates intestinal bile salt sulfates, enhancing the enterohepatic recirculation and subsequent hydroxylation of the desulfated bile salts. In addition, these data illustrate the importance of having a well-defined microflora to normalize intestinal transit time and cecal size of gnotobiotic animals when performing kinetic studies of enterohepatic circulating compounds.\r"

Cessation of zinc tablets and ingestion of an oral copper preparation daily for 2 mo failed to correct the anemia or leukopenia. It was not until shortly after intravenous administration of a cupric chloride solution during a 5-day period, at a total dose of 10 mg, that serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels increased and the anemia, leukopenia, and neutropenia resolved.

  ".W": "A 71-yr-old woman with a widely metastatic lipid-rich variant of breast cancer was found to have striking hyperamylasemia (85-fold normal). By isoelectric focusing, agarose gel electrophoresis, and a wheat protein inhibitor assay, the predominant serum amylase appeared to be identical to pancreatic isoamylase. Serum trypsin, serum lipase, and an abdominal computed tomography scan were normal, excluding the possibility of pancreatitis. Furthermore, both the primary breast tumor and skin metastases that developed 10 yr later stained immunohistochemically for amylase. Thus, breast carcinoma must be added to the list of tumors causing ectopic hyperamylasemia, and this case shows that nonpancreatic malignancies may produce pancreatic-type hyperamylasemia.\r"

Whereas the emergence of resistance is a major problem with the older quinolones such as nalidixic acid, this appears to be a minor problem with the new fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. These drugs are bactericidal and are well-absorbed orally. Parenteral preparations should be available in the future. The drugs are particularly active against gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The fluoroquinolones are less active against pneumococci, Group A streptococci, Pseudomonas cepacia, and most anaerobes. The drugs appear potentially useful to treat urinary tract infections caused by multiply resistant pathogens, prostatitis, gastrointestinal pathogens, osteomyelitis, gram-negative pneumonia, and sexually transmitted diseases. Adverse effects occur in approximately 10% of patients and include gastrointestinal symptoms and potential central nervous system toxicity in patients receiving theophylline, non-steroidal drugs, or caffeine. The oral quinolones may reduce the costs of treating serious infections in the elderly.\r"

The modified barium swallow using videofluoroscopy is the most useful modality we have at this time for diagnosing swallowing disorders and determining appropriate interventions. Frequently, swallowing problems can be addressed with changes in dietary consistencies, by changes in positioning, or by techniques to improve oral control and sensitivity to food in the mouth.\r"
