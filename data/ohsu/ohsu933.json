  ".W": "The relation between the left atrial systolic pressure waveform and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was observed in 17 patients who underwent diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Left atrial pressure and left ventricular pressure were simultaneously recorded from a multisensor catheter before and during angiotensin infusion. Left ventricular systolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were 133 +/- 17 and 12.3 +/- 3.2 mm Hg, respectively, before angiotensin infusion and increased to 168 +/- 18 (p less than 0.01) and 19.4 +/- 4.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), respectively, during infusion. The left atrial systolic pressure curve consisted of two positive waves--a first wave (A) and a second wave (A'). The A and A' wave pressures were 11.6 +/- 2.3 and 10.2 +/- 3.9 mm Hg, respectively, before angiotensin infusion and 16.5 +/- 2.9 (p less than 0.01) and 18.1 +/- 4.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), respectively, during infusion. The ratio of A'/A of left atrial systolic pressure was 0.81 +/- 0.27 before angiotensin infusion and 1.08 +/- 0.14 (p less than 0.01) during infusion. The ratio of A' to A of left atrial systolic pressure was linearly related to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure before and during (p less than 0.01) angiotensin infusion. The amplitude of the A wave exceeded that of the A' wave at normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressures. However, as the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased either at rest or during angiotensin infusion, the amplitude of the A' wave increased and often exceeded that of the A wave. These results suggest that the second (A') wave might be attributed to the increased reflection associated with increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.\r"

Using previously described methods, we examined the level, trend, and variability of blood pressures in those children with at least three readings. The level, trend, and variability of height, weight, and body mass index were compared among six separate groups of children. Two groups were categorized on the basis of high systolic pressure levels, one with low variability and the other with high variability, which was thought to resemble adult labile hypertension. Two additional groups were categorized on the basis of increasing and decreasing blood pressure trends; the fifth group had consistently low blood pressures, and the sixth group consisted of the remaining children. There were significant differences among the groups for the level of all the physical measurements and for the trend of body mass index. No significant differences were found among the groups for gender or socioeconomic status. A parental history of high blood pressure, stroke, or heart attack was significantly more common in the first two groups.\r"

A baffle fenestration, allowing right-to-left shunting, maintains cardiac output and limits right atrial pressure. A baffle fenestration was surgically created at the time of a modified Fontan repair in 20 consecutive patients. Risk factors included pulmonary artery pressure of 18 mm Hg or more, end-diastolic pressure of 12 mm Hg or more, valvar regurgitation, pulmonary artery distortion, pulmonary vascular resistance of 2 Woods' units or more, ventricular outflow obstruction, and complex anatomy. Nineteen of 20 patients survived. After the operation, mean arterial oxygen saturation was 86%, mean right atrial pressure was 15 mm Hg, and mean duration of pleural effusions was 6 days. Twelve of 19 survivors tolerated early test occlusion and had permanent transcatheter umbrella closure. Four patients failed early test occlusion, with a significant decrease in venous O2 saturation and a rise in central venous pressure, due to ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary artery distortion, or aortopulmonary collaterals. Three of four had successful late closure of the fenestration after correction of these abnormalities.\r"

Patients were classified by electrophysiological study results as having no inducible ventricular tachycardia, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms were examined for the duration of low-amplitude (less than or equal to 40 microV) QRS signal, duration of total QRS, and root-mean-square voltage of the terminal 40 msec of the QRS. Low-amplitude terminal root-mean-square voltage of 100 microV or less had 91% sensitivity and 70% specificity for ventricular tachycardia inducible by electrophysiological study. Similar sensitivity but less specificity were seen using the criterion of 20 msec or more total low-amplitude QRS signal (initial plus terminal) or using total QRS duration of 128 msec or more. There was a weaker association between terminal low-amplitude QRS signal of 15 msec or more and inducible ventricular tachycardia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Balloon dilation angioplasty or balloon valvotomy was performed with 8F and 9F catheters without an arterial sheath. Patients ranged in age from 5 days to 15.4 years (mean, 6.4 years). Of 64 patients, 29 (45.3%) had an acute iliofemoral complication, including thrombosis (18 of 64), complete disruption (five of 64), incomplete disruption (three of 64), and arterial tear (three of 64). The arterial pathology was confirmed in 23 of 29 patients by one or a combination of surgical exploration and repair (18 of 29), angiography (six of 29), and magnetic resonance imaging (three of 29). Of eight patients, three with arterial disruption had acute hypotension requiring transfusion and immediate surgery; the other five had absent pedal pulses after the procedure. Of these five, three developed bleeding during thrombolytic therapy and underwent surgical exploration, and two were diagnosed by angiography after ineffective thrombolytic therapy. Angiography in three patients with iliac artery avulsion showed tapered occlusion in two and an aneurysm in one. In patients with iliofemoral thrombosis, angiography showed occlusion from the puncture site to the origin of the external iliac artery. Eleven patients (17% of the entire group and 38% of the group with acute iliofemoral complications) had reduced or absent pedal pulses at the time of discharge. A significant correlation was found between increased incidence of iliofemoral thrombosis and disruption (as well as abnormal pedal pulses at hospital discharge) and low patient weight.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the usefulness of multiple measures from rest and exercise radionuclide angiography (RNA) in predicting cardiovascular death and cardiovascular events (death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) and to assess the prognostic usefulness of the RNA relative to clinical and catheterization data, we studied 571 stable patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease who had upright rest/exercise first-pass RNA within 3 months of catheterization and were medically treated. With a median follow-up of 5.4 years, 90 patients have died from cardiovascular causes, and 147 patients have either died or suffered a nonfatal myocardial infarction. Using the Cox regression model and a preselected group of RNA variables, the most important RNA predictor of mortality was exercise ejection fraction (chi 2 = 81, p less than 0.00001). Neither rest ejection fraction nor the change in ejection fraction from rest to exercise contributed additional predictive information. Two other RNA study variables, the change in heart rate from rest to exercise and rest end-diastolic volume index, did contribute additional prognostic information to the exercise ejection fraction (chi 2 = 23, p less than 0.0001). Compared with noninvasive clinical data (history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and chest radiograph), RNA variables were considerably more predictive of mortality (chi 2 = 71 [clinical variables] versus chi 2 = 104 [RNA]). Remarkably, the strength of the relation of RNA variables with mortality was equivalent to that of the set of catheterization variables previously demonstrated in our large angiographic population to be prognostically important (chi 2 = 104 [RNA] versus chi 2 = 102 [catheterization variables]). The RNA contained 84% of the information provided by clinical and catheterization descriptors combined. Furthermore, the RNA contributed significant additional prognostic information to the clinical and catheterization data (chi 2 = 13.6, p = 0.0035). For cardiovascular events, the relative prognostic usefulness of the RNA was similar, although relations with this outcome were generally weaker. Descriptors from the rest/exercise RNA exhibit a powerful relation with long-term outcomes and can be useful in defining risk, even when clinical and catheterization data are available.\r"

All patients underwent electrophysiology testing at entry to the study and were followed up annually for a total of 348 patient-years (median, 4.3 years). There were 44 male and 31 female patients, and age at enrollment ranged from 7 to 77 years (mean, 34 +/- 14 years). The median effective refractory period of the accessory pathway was 293 msec (interquartile range, 280-310 msec), and the median shortest RR interval between preexcited beats during atrial fibrillation (SRR) [corrected] was 274 msec (240-320 msec). Twenty-three patients had an SRR of 250 msec or less and eight patients had a median shortest SRR interval of 200 msec or less. Twelve patients had inducible sustained reciprocating tachycardia, 10 patients had inducible nonsustained reciprocating tachycardia, and 23 patients had inducible sustained atrial fibrillation. Twenty patients (27%) lacked retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway. No patient died suddenly during a median follow-up of 4.3 years. Six patients (8%) became symptomatic with documented supraventricular tachycardia, of whom two underwent operative ablation of their accessory pathways. No patient with absent retrograde accessory pathway conduction during the electrophysiology study became symptomatic. Inducible sustained or nonsustained reciprocating tachycardia at electrophysiology study did not predict the development of subsequent symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia. Nine patients lost preexcitation during follow-up. Age at enrollment (relative risk/decade, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.8) and anterograde accessory pathway refractory period (relative risk, 1.06/10 msec; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.12) were independent predictors of loss of preexcitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To be able to evaluate this activation and relate it to prognosis, we took blood samples at baseline and after 6 weeks from 239 patients with severe heart failure (all in New York Heart Association class IV) randomized to additional treatment with enalapril or placebo. In this study (CONSENSUS), which has previously been reported, there was a significant reduction in mortality among patients treated with enalapril. The present data show in the placebo group a significant positive relation between mortality and levels of angiotensin II (p less than 0.05), aldosterone (p = 0.003), noradrenaline (p less than 0.001), adrenaline (p = 0.001), and atrial natriuretic factor (p = 0.003). A similar relation was not observed among the patients treated with enalapril. Significant reductions in mortality in the groups of patients treated with enalapril were consistently found among patients with baseline hormone levels above median values. There were significant reductions in hormone levels from baseline to 6 weeks in the group of patients treated with enalapril for all hormones except adrenaline. There were no correlations between these changes in hormone levels. Summarily, there is a pronounced but variable neurohormonal activation in heart failure even in patients with similar clinical findings. This activation is reduced by enalapril therapy. The results suggest that the effect of enalapril on mortality is related to hormonal activation in general and the renin-angiotensin system in particular.\r"

Noninvasive indexes of platelet activation and of platelet/vessel wall interaction (urinary excretion of the 2,3-dinor-metabolites of thromboxane A2 [Tx-M] and prostacyclin [PGI-M], respectively) were analyzed in samples collected in the basal state and after the test. Basal Tx-M and PGI-M did not differ in patients with (236 +/- 35 and 131 +/- 22 pg/mg creatinine, respectively) and without (185 +/- 16 and 101 +/- 13 pg/mg creatinine, respectively) chest pain, or in those with (178 +/- 45 and 162 +/- 41 pg/mg, respectively) and without (216 +/- 22 and 104 +/- 11 pg/mg, respectively) ST-segment depression during the test. Patients without chest pain or without ST-segment depression moderately increased (p less than 0.05) their urinary Tx-M (by 21% and 13%, respectively) and PGI-M (by 28% and 23%, respectively) after exercise. No significant increases were observed in those developing chest pain or ST depression during exercise. These data indicate that effort-induced myocardial ischemia is not associated with an increase in platelet activation or platelet/vessel wall interaction in patients with stable coronary disease.\r"

Control heparin-protamine reactions induced rapid release of thromboxane into arterial plasma (more than 1 ng/ml plasma), a 2.5-fold increase of pulmonary artery pressure, a 20% decrease of PaO2, and a 30% reduction in arterial white blood cell concentration. After giving SQ 30,741 despite similar thromboxane release into arterial plasma after heparin-protamine challenge, acute pulmonary hypertension was significantly reduced when 94% of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle thromboxane receptors were occupied with SQ 30,741 (p less than 0.01 at 1 minute after protamine versus control heparin-protamine reaction) and was completely abolished by a 10 mg/kg i.v. bolus (p less than 0.0001 at 1 minute after protamine versus control). Peripheral leukopenia was not affected by SQ 30,741 prophylaxis, but hypoxemia was prevented. We conclude that thromboxane causes pulmonary vasoconstriction in ovine heparin-protamine-induced pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vasoconstriction and hypoxemia can be completely prevented by thromboxane receptor blockade.\r"

Thirty days after surgery, regional myocardial function and blood flow were assessed during exercise in 22 pigs separated into exercise (n = 12) and sedentary groups (n = 10). The exercise group trained on a treadmill for 25 +/- 1 days, 30-50 min/day, at heart rates of 210-220 beats/min. After 5 weeks, another exercise test was performed. In the exercise group, after training, we observed an improvement in systolic wall thickening, expressed as a percentage of rest, in the collateral-dependent LCx region from 64 +/- 8% to 87 +/- 6% (p less than 0.01) at moderate exercise levels (220 beats/min) and from 45 +/- 7% to 73 +/- 7% (p less than 0.01) at severe exercise levels (265 beats/min). Transmural myocardial blood flow in the LCx region expressed as a ratio of flow in the nonoccluded region of the left ventricle also increased significantly (p less than 0.01) during severe exercise after 5 weeks. The sedentary group showed an improvement in systolic wall thickening in the LCx region during moderate exercise compared with the initial exercise test (p less than 0.05) but no significant change in systolic wall thickening or myocardial blood flow ratios during severe exercise after 5 weeks. We conclude that long-term exercise after gradual LCx coronary artery occlusion in pigs improves myocardial function and coronary collateral reserve in collateral-dependent myocardium during exercise.\r"

The hearts were studied after inducing irreversible damage by cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor sodium cyanide (n = 8) or sarcolemmal membrane detergent Triton X-100 (n = 8). The control hearts (n = 6) received no toxins. Mean Tc-99m-MIBI peak accumulation activity was significantly reduced after cyanide (51.1 +/- 44.2% of control, p less than 0.01) and Triton (13.8 +/- 2.7% of control, p less than 0.001) administration. Kinetic studies also showed marked reduction in accumulation rates and marked increase in clearance rates for cyanide (p less than 0.01) and Triton (p less than 0.01) groups compared with controls. Potential changes in regional flow distribution were assessed using microspheres. When peak accumulation activity was corrected for these changes, there remained significant differences between the groups. In the cyanide and Triton groups, irreversible cell injury was confirmed by creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase release, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining, and electron microscopy. All the cells were viable in the control group. We conclude that the accumulation and clearance kinetics of Tc-99m-MIBI are significantly affected by cell viability. Tc-99m-MIBI kinetics appear to be dependent on sarcolemmal integrity and to a lesser extent on aerobic metabolism.\r"

Further reductions in coronary pressure to below a critical coronary pressure of approximately 60 mm Hg were associated with concomitant reductions in subendocardial flow and the endocardial-epicardial flow ratio during tachycardia. Although regional function remained constant over the autoregulatory plateau, there was a rightward shift of the coronary pressure-function relation during ischemia in response to a steady-state increase in rate from 100 to 200 beats/min. Reductions in regional wall thickening began when coronary pressures reached 38 +/- 7 mm Hg at a heart rate of 100 beats/min and 61 +/- 6 mm Hg at a heart rate of 200 beats/min (p less than 0.005). Similar critical coronary pressure values were obtained for subendocardial segment shortening. Relations between subendocardial flow and myocardial function measured by both transmural wall thickening and subendocardial segment shortening were linear during pacing at a heart rate of 200 beats/min with relative reductions in wall thickening related to reductions in subendocardial flow on a nearly one-to-one basis. The results of this study demonstrate that there is a shift in the lower limit of subendocardial autoregulation during tachycardia as manifest by the onset of subendocardial ischemia at a higher distal coronary artery pressure. The shift in critical coronary pressure relates to an increase in resting flow requirements due to increased demand and diminished subendocardial vasodilator reserve at any given coronary pressure secondary to a reduction in the time available for diastolic subendocardial perfusion during tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "The fundamental myocellular uptake and retention mechanisms of hexakis (2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile) technetium(I) (Tc-MIBI), a technetium-99m-based myocardial perfusion imaging agent, are unresolved. Because of the lipophilic cationic nature of Tc-MIBI, it may be distributed across biological membranes in response to transmembrane potential. To test this hypothesis, net uptake and retention of Tc-MIBI in cultured chick embryo ventricular myocytes were determined under conditions known to alter mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials. Isovolumic depolarization of plasma membrane potentials in 130 mM extracellular K (Ko) 20 mM extracellular Cl buffer reduced net accumulation of Tc-MIBI from 171 +/- 16 (control) to 29 +/- 3.3 fmol intracellular Tc-MIBI/mg protein.nM extracellular Tc-MIBI. Unidirectional influx of Tc-MIBI in cells depolarized in 30 mM Ko buffer was also reduced; a resting plasma membrane potential of -87 +/- 6 mV was calculated from the Goldman flux equation using normal Ko/high Ko Tc-MIBI influx ratios. Addition of the potassium ionophore valinomycin to cells incubated in 130 mM Ko buffer to additionally depolarize mitochondrial membrane potentials further reduced net uptake of Tc-MIBI to levels comparable to that found in nonviable freeze-thawed preparations ([Tc-MIBI]i/[Tc-MIBI]o = 1). By depolarizing mitochondrial (and in part plasma membrane) potentials with the protonophores 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) Tc-MIBI was rapidly depleted from 181 +/- 16 (control) to 16 +/- 2.6 and 31 +/- 4.2 fmol/mg protein.nMo, respectively, with kinetics that did not correlate with loss of cellular ATP content. CCCP alone inhibited 90 +/- 3% of net accumulation or 66 +/- 3% of unidirectional influx of Tc-MIBI in a concentration-dependent manner. By hyperpolarizing mitochondrial membrane potentials with the K+/H+ ionophore nigericin or the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, net uptake and retention of Tc-MIBI were increased by 60 +/- 9% and 375 +/- 20%, respectively. Caffeine, as well as the respiratory chain electron transport inhibitor rotenone, did not significantly alter net cell uptake (p greater than 0.2). These data indicate that the fundamental myocellular uptake mechanism of Tc-MIBI involves passive distribution across plasma and mitochondrial membranes and that at equilibrium Tc-MIBI is sequestered within mitochondria by the large negative transmembrane potentials.\r"

These inconsistencies include the choice of exercise protocol, exercise end points, points of analysis, and absence or misuse of gas exchange data. Gas exchange techniques greatly enhance the accuracy with which cardiopulmonary function is assessed by exercise. Commonly used protocols are not always appropriate for all patients or all studies. Both cardiovascular disease and the exercise protocol can have an important impact on the relation between changes in work rate and oxygen uptake. Ramp protocols appear to offer the greatest promise for assessing cardiopulmonary function. Analyzing hemodynamic and gas exchange responses at several points submaximally, in addition to those at peak exercise, can add important information concerning the efficacy of a drug. A great deal of confusion continues to hinder the application of the gas exchange anaerobic threshold, and many of the commonly used testing end points are not reliable.\r"

In this paper, we present a composite clinical end point that includes, in order, severity of adverse outcome death, hemorrhagic stroke, nonhemorrhagic stroke, poor ejection fraction (less than 30%), reinfarction, heart failure, and pulmonary edema. Such a composite index may be useful to detect true therapeutic benefit in reperfusion trials without necessitating greater than 20-30,000 patient enrollment.\r"

To determine the proper management of splenic infarcts and abscess due to septic emboli, we retrospectively reviewed the records of 108 patients with left-sided endocarditis who underwent valvular surgery at the University of Illinois Hospital from 1980 through 1988. Intravenous drug abuse was the etiology in 68% (n = 73). The incidence of splenic infarcts and abscess was 19% (n = 20), but an incidental finding of splenic infarcts was found in 38% (n = 11) of 29 asymptomatic patients who had computed tomograms. Streptococci and staphylococci were the causative organisms in 85% (n = 17). Localized findings were absent in 90% of splenic infarcts and abscesses. Abdominal computed tomograms were diagnostic of the sequelae of splenic septic emboli in 100%. No patient had intra-abdominal bleeding complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. Splenectomy was performed in 50% (n = 10) of patients 3-24 days (mean, 11.2 days) after valve replacement. Indications for splenectomy included persistent sepsis in 60% (n = 6), large (greater than 2 cm) and peripheral lesions in 30% (n = 3), and splenic rupture in 10% (n = 1). Perioperative mortality of patients who underwent splenectomy was 30% (n = 3). The following conclusions can be drawn: 1) Splenic septic embolus is common in endocarditis. 2) Abdominal computed tomography should be performed for all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Aortic valve replacement was performed in 240 patients, mitral valve replacement in 132 patients, and multiple valve replacement in 41. The Carpentier-Edwards porcine (n = 336), Angell-Shiley porcine (n = 23), Hancock porcine (n = 11), and the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial valves (n = 43) were inserted. Follow-up between 5 and 12 years postoperatively was 98% complete. Freedom from structural valve deterioration was 72 +/- 7%, 59 +/- 9%, and 59 +/- 9%, respectively, after aortic, mitral, and double valve replacement. The risk of structural valve deterioration and reoperation for valve-related complications was significantly increased with the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial prosthesis. The risk for reoperation was inversely related to patient age. Postoperative Doppler echocardiographic studies in 87% of available patients revealed a subgroup of asymptomatic patients with evidence of structural valve deterioration. These patients (n = 61) had significantly reduced prosthetic valve areas (aortic less than 1 cm2, mitral less than 1.7 cm2), elevated resting transvalvular gradients (aortic greater than 40 mm Hg), or moderate-to-severe regurgitation. In summary, postoperative Doppler echocardiographic examination identified asymptomatic patients with structural valve dysfunction. These patients must be followed up carefully to determine the optimal timing of reoperation.\r"

Mean pressure gradients were measured using micromanometer catheters and cardiac outputs by thermodilution. Multiple measurements were made in each patient with atrial pacing, volume infusion, and inotropic drugs for a total of 319 observations. The pressure gradients and Gorlin valve areas showed significant scatter caused by both flow-dependent and patient-dependent variability. Mean transvalvular pressure gradients were therefore compared after adjustment for flow rate and for random interpatient differences using analysis of variance and covariance. Pressure gradients were lower and Gorlin valve areas larger for the Hancock valve than for the Carpentier-Edwards valve, but the differences were significant only for the smaller valve sizes. Compared with the Carpentier-Edwards valve, the mean pressure gradients were significantly lower for the Hancock 19-mm modified orifice (MO) valves (16.9 versus 31.7 mm Hg, p = 0.04), for the 21-mm valves (15.2 versus 22.4 mm Hg, p = 0.003), and for the 23-mm MO valve (9.2 versus 13.8 mm Hg, p = 0.04).

  ".U": "91029940\r", 
  ".W": "A bold and imaginative development, the cavopulmonary anastomosis, appeared to originate in several centers almost simultaneously. After extensive research on right heart bypass, Glenn was the first in North America to perform a successful experimental cavopulmonary shunt, and it became known by his name. In properly selected patients, palliation success was excellent, and mortality rates were low. From 1961 through 1988, we used a cavopulmonary anastomosis for palliation in 139 infants and children. There were eight hospital deaths, and most occurred early in the series. Palliation generally lasted 6-8 years-until the child outgrew the blood supply to the contralateral lung. Palliation could be restored by increased flow to that lung with another shunt. Six otherwise inoperable patients received benefit from the addition of an axillary arteriovenous fistula. Late pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas were identified in 11% of our patients by angiography, but with more sensitive testing, the incidence rate may be as high as 21%. The occurrence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas caused general concern and less frequent use of the shunt. Recent application of an end-to-side anastomosis, creating a bidirectional shunt, has restored interest. A major legacy of the cavopulmonary anastomosis was demonstration of the feasibility of partial right heart bypass, which paved the way for the Fontan operation, and it is frequently constructed as part of that operation. Currently, the Glenn shunt is most often used as a temporary or permanent alternative to a Fontan repair if there appears to be significant risk. The risk factors usually encountered include small pulmonary arteries, young age, poor ventricular function, atrioventricular valve incompetence, and myocardial hypertrophy-sometimes alone but often in combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A successful outcome of an arterial switch operation (ASO) for dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) depends in large part on the transfer of the coronary arteries to the neoaorta without distortion or narrowing. However, the origins and distribution of the coronary arteries are quite variable in D-TGA; therefore, the entire experience with ASO at the Children's Hospital in Boston was reviewed. From 1983 through November 1989, 314 patients underwent surgery for D-TGA with the intent to perform an ASO. An ASO was actually performed in 290 patients, and 20 patients died, with 12 deaths (4.2%) clearly related to problems with the coronary arteries (CA deaths). The ASO was aborted to a Senning operation in 24 patients (7.6%), primarily due to coronary anatomy. Eight coronary patterns were identified and related to the outcome of the ASO. In 182 patients with the \"usual\" coronary pattern for D-TGA (i.e., anterior descending and circumflex arteries from the left sinus and right coronary artery from the right sinus), five CA deaths occurred, and two patients had Senning operations. Sixty-seven patients had right coronary and circumflex arteries from the right sinus and anterior descending arteries from the left sinus. Three CA deaths occurred, and one patient had a Senning operation. Single right coronary artery was found in 14; 12 had ASOs with three CA deaths (25%); and two had Senning operations. One late death was due to diffuse narrowing of the single right coronary artery. Single left coronary artery occurred in 11 patients, and seven had ASO with no early but one late \"sudden\" death, whereas four had Senning operations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between April 4, 1984, and December 31, 1987, 156 consecutive neonates with simple transposition of the great arteries underwent an arterial switch operation (ASO) at our institution. Surgery was performed before the age of 15 days in 96%, and patient weight was less than 3 kg in 28%. Seventeen patients (10.9%) died after surgery. One patient was lost to follow-up. Of the 138 survivors, two died of myocardial infarction 35 and 40 days, respectively, after surgery. They were the only late deaths, and actuarial survival rates were 87% (70% confidence level [CL], 83-89%) at 45 days and 87% (70% CL, 68-95%) at 52 months. Another patient had a myocardial infarction 50 days after surgery and is well 50 months later. Pulmonary stenosis was observed in 14 patients (10.3%) during the first year after surgery; two patients were reoperated on 10 and 12 months, respectively, after ASO. Aortic regurgitation was observed in 17 patients: two had grades II and III, respectively, aortic regurgitation on aortography; in 15 patients, it was detected only by Doppler examination. At the last follow-up (2-52 months after ASO; mean, 27.3 +/- 11.3 months), all patients were asymptomatic and taking no medication. On bidimensional echocardiography, left ventricular fractional shortening was normal at rest in all survivors but one. One patient had junctional rhythm, and one had Wenckebach periods; the remainder were in sinus rhythm. For as long as 5 years after ASO, late death and reintervention were rare; 99% of the survivors were asymptomatic and had sinus rhythm and good systemic ventricular function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the results of palliative surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, we reviewed the records of 57 infants who underwent first-stage reconstruction at our institution between July 1983 and April 1989. Of the 57 infants, 12 (21%) are long-term survivors and 45 (79%) have died. Thirty-one infants died within the first 30 days after surgery. Twenty-six of the 31 early deaths occurred within the first 24 hours after surgery. Causes of early mortality were low cardiac output (23), sepsis (two), sudden death (two), pulmonary vein atresia (three), and cardiac transplant (one). Late death occurred in 14 infants due to sepsis (three), sudden death (four), and death at reoperation (seven - three after Fontan procedure, three after shunt replacement, and one after transplant). Of the 31 patients who survived more than 24 hours, the complications noted by echocardiography and confirmed by catheterization when reoperation was indicated were significant arch obstruction (13%), branch pulmonary artery stenosis (23%), small atrial septal defect (16%), inadequate shunt (26%), neoaortic regurgitation (13%), tricuspid regurgitation (13%), ventricular dysfunction (29%), thrombus (6%), and superior vena cava obstruction (3%). Of the 31 patients who survived more than 24 hours, 16 additional palliative surgical procedures were performed in eight patients. These procedures included arch reconstruction (four), additional shunt (four), Glenn shunt (three), atrial septectomy (two), coarctation balloon angioplasty (two), and pulmonary artery reconstruction and reshunting (one). Of the 12 long-term survivors, four have had a successful Fontan procedure, one has had a transplant, and seven are awaiting a second-stage procedure. Thus, 69% of all deaths occurred within the first 30 days of surgery, and 58% of all deaths occurred within the first 24 hours due to cardiovascular collapse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91029944\r", 
  ".W": "We performed transventricular pulmonary valvotomy as initial surgery in 22 consecutive patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum who had a patent infundibulum. Nineteen patients also had placement of a central aortopulmonary shunt. All patients survived surgery, and 16 patients have had preoperative and later postoperative catheterizations. The purpose of this study was to determine the response of the right ventricle to transventricular pulmonary valvotomy with regard to relief of right ventricular hypertension and growth of the entire right ventricle, including tricuspid valve, right ventricular volume, and right ventricular outflow tract. Right ventricular systolic pressure decreased from 111.3 +/- 31.7 mm Hg before initial surgery to 65.6 +/- 26.2 mm Hg. Right ventricular end-diastolic volume increased from 59.1 +/- 39.3% of predicted normal before initial surgery to 114.6 +/- 63.2% at late follow-up catheterization. Tricuspid valve anulus circumference also increased in size from 73.2 +/- 21.3% of predicted normal before initial surgery to 90.4 +/- 22.8% at late follow-up catheterization. Only one patient (6%) required a transanular right ventricular outflow tract patch at the time of biventricular repair. Twenty of 22 patients (91%) either have had or are awaiting biventricular repair. We conclude that transventricular pulmonary valvotomy and central aortopulmonary shunt can be performed safely in newborn infants with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum who have a patent infundibulum. Effective valvotomy relieves right ventricular hypertension, allows for excellent right ventricular and tricuspid valve growth, and optimizes potential for biventricular repair.\r"

  ".U": "91029945\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1973 and March 1989, 176 patients with tricuspid atresia had the Fontan procedure performed at the Mayo Clinic. Age range at the time of surgery was 7 months to 42 years, with 43 patients (24%) 16 years old or older. Hospital mortality rates were 17% (nine of 54) from 1973 through 1980 and 8% (10 of 122) from 1981 through 1989. There have been 10 late cardiovascular deaths. Postoperative follow-up of 139 survivors (range, 6 months to 14 years; mean, 5.5 years) revealed 91% to be in excellent or good condition and 9% to be in fair or poor condition. Patients in fair or poor condition had poor stamina and/or fluid retention with intermittent pleural effusion, ascites, and so on. Two factors that clearly influence operative and late results are preoperative pulmonary arteriolar resistance (Rpa) and left ventricular diastolic function. A preoperative catheterization index devised by adding Rpa to left ventricular end-diastolic pressure divided by QpI plus QsI may be helpful in selecting candidates most likely to survive and benefit from the Fontan operation. In our experience, if this index is less than 4.0, then the postoperative right atrial mean pressure will be 20 mm Hg or less, a circumstance associated with 95% early and 89% overall survival rates.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-eight patients considered to be at increased risk for a Fontan repair underwent bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis. Twenty-one of the 38 had concurrent pulmonary artery reconstruction. Fontan risk factors included pulmonary artery distortion, elevated pulmonary artery resistance (greater than 2 Woods units) and/or pulmonary artery pressure (mean, greater than 18 mm Hg), atrioventricular valve regurgitation, systemic ventricular dysfunction, complex venous anatomy, and subaortic obstruction. There were no deaths, either early or late. Median arterial oxygen saturation increased from 79% to 84% (p less than 0.01). Median hospital stay was 8 days. No patient had pleural effusions after 7 days. Three patients had significant surgical complications. Five patients had inadequate relief of cyanosis; three of these had venous collaterals and two had severe ventricular dysfunction; the latter two patients subsequently had strokes. One of the patients with persistent cyanosis required a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt. We conclude that a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt, with pulmonary artery reconstruction when indicated, provides adequate relief of cyanosis in most patients with single-ventricle lesions who are considered to be at increased risk for a Fontan repair. Relief of ventricular volume overload and pulmonary artery distortion may improve Fontan candidacy. Also, patients with persistent cyanosis after bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis should be catheterized for location and occlusion of venous collaterals. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the place of bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis in the management of patients at increased risk for a Fontan repair.\r"

The three morphological groups were 1) univentricular atrioventricular connection (n = 19), 2) tricuspid atresia (n = 9), and 3) other complex malformations (n = 9). Subaortic stenosis was present in 15 patients (40%) in this group compared with 31 of 208 early survivors (15%) (p = 0.008). Pulmonary artery banding, identified as a risk factor in our previous experience, was performed in 14 patients, nine of whom had subaortic stenosis. Nine palliative procedures for subaortic stenosis were performed in eight patients--before the Fontan procedure in three patients and concurrently with the Fontan procedure in five patients. Myocardial hypertrophy and signs of acute ischemic injury were common findings at autopsy (n = 25) and were particularly prominent in all patients with univentricular heart of left ventricular morphology associated with subaortic stenosis and previous pulmonary artery banding (n = 7). We conclude that the present majority of deaths occurring after the modified Fontan procedure are myocardial in nature and attributable to advanced myocardial hypertrophy that is potentiated by previous pulmonary artery banding and subaortic stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of right atrial cardiomyoplasty is to increase atrial-pulmonary flow in patients undergoing Fontan-type procedures. We developed two surgical techniques to bypass the right ventricle, followed by right atrial cardiomyoplasty with a stimulated latissimus dorsi muscle flap (LDMF). In 10 goats, the left LDMF was transferred into the chest by removal of the second rib. After sternotomy, the right atrial appendages of five goats (group 1) were connected to the distal main pulmonary artery with polytetrafluoroethylene tubing and the proximal pulmonary trunks were ligated. In the other five goats (group 2), under cardiopulmonary bypass, bioprosthetic valves were implanted into the inferior venae cavae. The tricuspid orifice was closed, and the atriopulmonary connection was performed. The left LDMF was sutured over the right atrium and stimulated using synchronous 30-Hz bursts of impulses delivered by a Medtronic Cardiomyostimulator. Hemodynamic studies were performed in the acute phase. Right atrial, pulmonary arterial, and aortic pressures were assessed. Cardiac output was measured using ultrasonic flow studies. LDMF stimulation restored pulsatile pressure patterns in the pulmonary artery and increased the cardiac output. These observations were more evident in the model with caval valvular implant. This functional \"ventricularization\" of the right atrium could improve long-term results after Fontan-type procedures and extend operative indications. Chronic experimental studies are necessary to evaluate the diastolic and systolic functions of the neo-right ventricle.\r"

These patients were evaluated by TEE with either the single-plane probe (39 patients) or the biplanar probe (18 patients) just after admission. The intimal flap was detected in all patients, and there were 18 patients with type A dissection and 39 patients with type B dissection. The entry was visualized in 83% of type A dissection cases and in 90% of type B dissection cases. In two of 18 patients examined with the biplanar probe technique, the entry was detected in the longitudinal view only. Emergency operations were performed in 18 patients with type A dissection and in 10 patients with ruptured type B dissection. Twenty-nine of 39 patients with type B dissection were treated conservatively. The operative mortality rate of patients with type A dissection was 22%, and that of patients with ruptured type B dissection was 60%. The major advantage of TEE is its ease of application at the bedside or in the operating room, which allows immediate and accurate diagnosis of acute aortic dissection for emergency surgical intervention. Biplanar TEE provides additional acoustic windows, ease of spatial orientation, and more accurate visualization of entry. TEE is a useful and powerful diagnostic tool for acute aortic dissection, and by using this method, one may achieve a more rapid and aggressive surgical approach for patients with acute aortic dissection.\r"

Seven were asymptomatic, and six had symptoms ranging from recurrent pulmonary infection to moderate congestive heart failure. Six had anomalous venous return from the entire left lung, and seven had anomalous return from the upper lobe only. Eight of the patients had associated cardiovascular anomalies. Four of the patients underwent surgical correction via a sternotomy approach with cardiopulmonary bypass to allow correction of coexisting intracardiac anomalies. The remaining patients underwent surgical repair through a left thoracotomy. The technique included high ligation and division of a persistent left superior vena cava with anastomosis to the left atrium at the site of partial excision of the atrial appendage.

The median age at the time of initial reconstruction was 6 days (range, 1 day to 7.2 months). In 28 patients, a right modified Blalock-Taussig shunt was used; in 172 patients, a central shunt was placed. Additional procedures (n = 41) performed in 38 patients (median age, 5 months; range, 6 days to 17.5 months) were revision of systemic-to-pulmonary shunt (n = 15), arch reconstruction (n = 8), balloon angioplasty of arch obstruction (n = 7), atrial septectomy (n = 4), pulmonary artery angioplasty (n = 2), tricuspid valve annuloplasty or replacement (n = 4), and modified Glenn shunt (n = 1). There was no significant difference in the frequency of additional procedures performed more than 30 postoperative days in the survivors compared with the nonsurvivors. Actuarial survival rates were 0.66 (1 month), 0.48 (12 months), and 0.44 (18 months). Seventy percent of all deaths occurred during the initial admission, with 32% resulting from acute cardiovascular collapse during the first postoperative day. There was no statistical difference in actuarial survival when assessed by the type of shunt used or by anatomical subtype or when the influence of additional interventions was considered. Substantial improvement in outcome may be possible if immediate perioperative mortality can be reduced. We speculate that some of the intermediate mortality (30 days to 1 year) may be related to the effects of chronic exposure of the right ventricle to volume overload at systemic pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To analyze cost differences rigorously, we studied 115 patients undergoing initial elective angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, PTCA) and 274 patients undergoing initial elective surgery (coronary artery bypass graft surgery, CABG). Detailed resource consumption profiles were constructed and used to estimate the cost savings from switching a patient from CABG to PTCA. Four cost-accounting methods were used in the analysis; each method made different assumptions about the costs that would vary and the costs that would be fixed according to the number of procedures performed. The variable costs in the four methods were the 1) cost of supplies, 2) cost of personnel and supplies, 3) average direct costs, and 4) average direct costs plus allocated hospital overhead. The mean hospital charges for CABG patients were $19,644 versus $9,556 for PTCA patients (p less than 0.0001). The estimated cost difference between CABG and PTCA was substantially less than the $10,088 difference in charges, however, with net savings of 19%, 46%, 53%, and 78% of charges using cost-accounting methods 1-4, respectively. Thus, although the initial hospital charges for PTCA are significantly less than for CABG, the actual economic cost savings may be significantly overestimated by the use of hospital charge data.\r"

Subsequent analysis of anatomical extent of disease and preoperative baseline risk factors showed no differences (p = NS) between the two groups. All variables reflecting operative technique were similar (p = NS) for the two groups, except 74% of group 1 patients with multivessel disease received a single IMA graft, whereas 71% of group 2 patients with multivessel disease received multiple IMAs (p less than 0.05).

Survival probabilities (expressed as 30-day group 1/group 2; 4-year group 1/group 2) were overall (0.97/0.98; 0.93/0.90), elective (0.98/0.99; 0.97/0.92), acute (0.95/0.97; 0.89/0.88), age of less than 65 years (0.98/0.99; 0.97/0.93), age of 65 years or older (0.93/0.97; 0.84/0.89), ejection fraction of 0.40 or more (0.97/0.99; 0.95/0.94), ejection fraction of less than 0.40 (0.95/0.96; 0.87/0.82), nondiabetic (0.98/0.98; 0.94/0.91), and diabetic (0.92/0.97; 0.88/0.87).

  ".W": "The indications for use of the internal mammary artery as a coronary bypass conduit in older patients are not clearly established. Between January 1985 and December 1988, 786 patients received single internal mammary artery grafts alone (717) or in conjunction with other procedures (69). Of these patients, 341 were 65 years of age or older (mean, 69.3 years). This group was compared with those patients less than 65 years of age (mean, 56.2 years). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of diabetes mellitus; the number of distal coronary anastomoses; left ventricular wall motion score; the frequency of isolated bypass procedures, reoperations, or emergent operations; or the durations of aortic clamping and cardiopulmonary bypass. The older group contained more women (34.9% versus 20.7%) and more patients with left main coronary artery disease (15.5% versus 9.4%) (p less than 0.01). No significant differences in the frequency of reoperation for hemorrhage, perioperative infarction, neurological deficits, requirements for intra-aortic balloon pumping, sternal wound infections, necessity for prolonged ventilatory support, or 30-day mortality (2.7% versus 3.2%) were observed. The length of postoperative hospitalization was greater in the older group (11.8 versus 10.2 days) (p = 0.02). Blinded histological examination of biopsies from 61 internal mammary artery grafts (34 patients less than 65 years, 27 patients greater than or equal to 65 years) showed no significant differences in luminal area or wall thickness. No significant degenerative changes were observed in either group. We conclude that the use of the internal mammary artery for bypass grafting in older patients is safe and may provide long-term benefit.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied 159 patients 80 years of age or older who have had isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) since 1977. Eighty-seven percent have had surgery since 1984. Two thirds of the patients were male, and the mean age was 82 years. Most patients (97%) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV, 89% had unstable/postinfarction angina pectoris, and 67% had rest pain. Almost half (47%) required preoperative admission to the coronary care unit, 6% required preoperative use of an intra-aortic balloon pump, and 20% were operated on emergently. Significant left main coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis) was present in 41%. Ten patients (6.3%) died within 30 days of surgery, with seven more patients dying during the same hospital admission or soon after transfer to another institution. This resulted in an overall hospital mortality of 10.7%. The median hospital stay was 10 days. On univariate analysis, the significant predictors of hospital mortality were NYHA IV, angina at rest, preoperative admission to the coronary care unit, emergency operation, ejection fraction less than 0.50, and the presence of mitral regurgitation. On multivariate analysis, ejection fraction less than 0.50 was the only significant risk factor (p less than 0.01). Of hospital survivors, 98% have been followed for a mean of 29 months. The estimated 5-year survival (+/- SEM) of all patients was 71 +/- 4.5%, and for hospital survivors, 80 +/- 4.5%. The most important predictor of adverse survival was an ejection fraction less than 0.50. Seventy-nine percent are angina-free, and 89% are in NYHA classes I and II. The majority of patients felt that they were improved by surgery. We conclude that CABG in patients 80 years or older, although associated with increased operative risk, gives excellent relief of symptoms and good 5-year survival. Patients should not be denied CABG because of age alone.\r"

Patients received either aspirin 325 mg q.d., aspirin 325 mg t.i.d., aspirin 325 mg and dipyridamole 75 mg t.i.d., or placebo. Aspirin was initiated either 12 hours before or 6 hours after operation. Patients were stratified preoperatively for extent of disease and randomized to the therapies outlined above. There was no randomization to IMA versus saphenous vein grafts to the LAD. When the patients taking placebo were compared with those taking aspirin, there were no differences in the IMA (100.0% versus 92.1%, p = 0.385) or vein graft (88.8% versus 90.4%, p = 0.675) patency rates. The patency rate, irrespective of treatment, for all IMA grafts was 92.8% (220 of 237) versus 90.1% (345 of 383) for all vein grafts to the LAD (p = 0.309). Thus, both the IMA and vein grafts had excellent patency rates at 1 year. Aspirin did not alter this at 1 year, and there were no differences between IMA and vein graft patency to the LAD.\r"

Our initial operation of choice in patients requiring multiple operations in this group of 690 patients was based on the most life-threatening or symptomatic aortic segment involved, which was ascending aorta and/or aortic arch (Asc/Arch) in 301 (44%) patients, descending thoracic aorta (Desc) in 195 (28%) patients, and thoracoabdominal aorta (TaA) in 194 (28%) patients. As detailed below, considerable improvement occurred in the 30-day survival rates over time, particularly for acute dissection: [table; see text] The independent determinants of both early and long-term mortality were identified. Independent determinants of late fatal rupture, reoperation, and neuromuscular dysfunction for distal dissectors were also identified. In our experience, continued aggressive surgical intervention for aortic dissection with modern operative techniques has resulted in markedly improved 30-day operative survival (approaching 95% including those patients with acute dissection) and significant improvement in late results.\r"

All patients were in New York Heart Association functional class IV, and 15 of them were in cardiogenic shock when operated on. Coronary arteriography was performed in all patients before surgery: nine had one-vessel, 11 had two-vessel, and 11 had three-vessel disease. The VSD was anterior in 15 patients and posterior in 16. The operative technique evolved over the years from a fairly extensive infarctectomy and reconstruction of the septum and right and left ventricular walls with a double Dacron patch, to minimal or no infarctectomy and closure of the VSD by excluding the infarcted muscle from the left ventricular cavity. This is accomplished by suturing a single patch of bovine pericardium to healthy endocardium surrounding the infarcted muscle. The right ventricle is left intact. Overall mortality was 10%, with three operative deaths. All deaths occurred in patients in cardiogenic shock who had three-vessel coronary artery disease. Thus, the mortality for patients in shock was 20%, and the mortality for patients with three-vessel disease was 27%. The operative mortality for patients with posterior VSD was twice as high as in patients with anterior VSD. However, univariate analysis of various clinical, hemodynamic, and operative variables indicated that only three-vessel disease was predictive of operative mortality. Because the number of patients was small and the overall operative mortality relatively low, the results of this analysis may not be valid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A distinction was made between akinetic and dyskinetic aneurysms to assess potential relation with postoperative outcome. Indications for surgery were arrhythmia in 20 patients, congestive heart failure in 81, angina in 133, congestive heart failure and angina in 42, and other combinations in the remaining 27 patients. The left ventricular aneurysm was dyskinetic in 180 patients and akinetic in 121. Risk factors and surgical procedures were similar in both groups. Left ventricular ejection fraction was less than or equal to 30% in 98 patients. Coronary bypass grafting was performed in 269 patients, with an average of 2.3 grafts per patient. Mitral valve replacement, the most common concomitant procedure, was performed in 16 patients. Intra-aortic balloon assist was required postoperatively in 47 patients. Overall operative mortality was 13% (38 patients) and was due to low cardiac output in 23 patients and arrhythmia in 12 patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses related early mortality to New York Heart Association functional classification of heart failure, the predominant indications of arrhythmia or congestive heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 30%, the need for intra-aortic balloon support, and the excision of an akinetic (18%) rather than dyskinetic (8%) left ventricular aneurysm. Over a follow-up period averaging nearly 5 years, the actuarial survival at 5 years was 63% in the dyskinetic group and 51% in the akinetic group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty was performed in 11 patients with advanced heart failure due to cardiomyopathy who were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV despite maximal medical therapy. There were no operative deaths. Eight patients were followed for a mean of 10.8 months. Two patients remain in muscle conditioning protocol. One patient died with latissimus dorsi ischemia and congestive heart failure. Four of the eight patients in long-term follow-up are in NYHA class I, three in class II, and one in class III. At 3 months of follow-up, rest radioisotopic left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 20.5 +/- 3.6% to 26.8 +/- 8.1% (p less than 0.01). Doppler-echocardiography demonstrated that left ventricular segmental wall shortening improved from 11.3 +/- 2.5% to 16.5 +/- 3.9% (p less than 0.01) and left ventricular stroke volume from 22.9 +/- 4.6 to 33.1 +/- 10 ml (p less than 0.01). Cardiopulmonary exercise test showed that maximal oxygen consumption during treadmill test increased from 14.8 +/- 3.7 to 18.2 +/- 3.3 ml/kg.min (p less than 0.05). At 6 months of follow-up, all the above values remained essentially unchanged. Furthermore, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was abolished without specific medical therapy in four patients. Thus, cardiomyoplasty improves left ventricular function, reverses congestive heart failure, and may improve long-term survival in severe cardiomyopathies.\r"

ATP and catabolites were assessed in serial transmural biopsies. Cardioplegia significantly delayed the breakdown of ATP during storage. After infusion of the adenosine-supplemented UW solution, myocardial content of adenosine was high as compared with that in NIH-arrested hearts (9.12 versus 0.01 mumol.g-1 dry wt). During cold storage, however, adenosine converted to inosine in spite of profound hypothermia. This renders unlikely the potential of fast resynthesis of ATP out of the supplemented nucleoside pool after reoxygenation.\r"

This rate of diameter decline was 20-fold more rapid during the initial posttransplantation year than the rate of change of visually normal segments in nontransplant patients with coronary atherosclerosis elsewhere. There was no significant drop in mean diameter between the first and second year in those patients who had second-year studies. Decrease in absolute diameter for vessels greater than 2.9 mm significantly exceeded diameter reduction for smaller vessels but did not differ when considered as a ratio of vessel diameter.

From December 1983 through December 1988, all patients (N = 139) who underwent orthotopic cardiac transplant at our institution received triple-drug immunosuppressant therapy. Follow-up averaged 32.2 +/- 15.8 months. Twenty-one patients died; 134 survived more than 30 days. Actuarial survival was 92% at 1 year, 85% at 3 years, and 78% at 5 years. Twenty-five episodes of acute graft rejection were diagnosed in 21 of the 139 recipients (0.18 episode per patient). In patients, the incidence of infection was 0.82 episode; 72% of infections were viral, with 10% due to cytomegalovirus. The incidence of coronary artery disease was 10% at 1 year, 25% at 3 years, and 36% at 5 years. Coronary artery disease was responsible for 60% of late deaths. Arterial hypertension developed in 81% of patients, despite relatively well-maintained renal function (serum creatinine, 1.7 +/- 0.3 mg/dl). Skeletal complications occurred in 15.8% and lymphoma in 1.4% of recipients. Complete long-term rehabilitation was achieved in all but two of the surviving patients. These data support the short- and long-term effectiveness of triple-drug therapy. This regimen reduces the incidence of rejection, infection, and lymphoma, as well as the degree of renal failure. However, the incidence of posttransplant coronary artery disease has not been reduced, and graft atherosclerosis represents the major cause of late graft failure and death.\r"

Lovastatin, which inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, in doses of 40-80 mg/day effectively lowers cholesterol in the general cardiac population but has been associated with rhabdomyolysis in cardiac transplant recipients. To determine whether lower doses of lovastatin would be effective and safe for lowering cholesterol after cardiac transplantation, 44 patients with blood cholesterol greater than 200 mg/dl at least 6 months after cardiac transplantation received 10-20 mg lovastatin daily. In addition, lovastatin enzyme inhibitor level was assayed in six patients to determine whether metabolism of the drug was abnormal. Lovastatin decreased total cholesterol by 28% from 282 +/- 54 to 208 +/- 62 mg/dl (p less than 0.005), primarily because of reduction in the low-density lipoprotein fractions, and was well-tolerated without any symptoms or abnormal creatine phosphokinase levels in 43 of 44 patients. One patient developed rhabdomyolysis and reversible renal failure when lovastatin was increased to 40 mg daily. Enzyme inhibitor levels in the six transplant patients were 4.2-7.8 times higher than those measured in normal volunteers. Low-dose lovastatin effectively lowers cholesterol in patients after transplantation, but metabolism is altered, perhaps by cyclosporine. Monitoring of enzyme inhibitor levels may be required to allow safe administration of this drug to cardiac transplant recipients.\r"

  ".W": "Direct mechanical ventricular actuation (DMVA) is a unique non-blood-contacting biventricular assist device that provides circulatory support during ventricular fibrillation without demonstrating adverse effects on the myocardium. The purpose of this study was to assess the preservation of myocardial energy stores and myocardial responses to ischemia after circulatory support during ventricular fibrillation with direct mechanical ventricular actuation versus cardiopulmonary bypass. Twenty adult mongrel dogs were randomized to receive circulatory support with either cardiopulmonary bypass or direct mechanical ventricular actuation. After 4 hours of ventricular fibrillation, hearts were defibrillated and left ventricular transmural biopsies were obtained. Hearts were then excised and subjected to 90 minutes of normothermic total ischemia. Serial biopsies were obtained at 15-minute intervals to determine regional depletion of high energy phosphates. The time-to-peak ischemic contracture was recorded by using needle-tipped Millar catheters placed in the left ventricular endocardium, epicardium, septum, and right ventricle. Time-to-peak ischemic contracture of the endocardium (62.6 +/- 1.4 vs. 58.8 +/- 1.0 minutes, p less than 0.05) and septum (61.1 +/- 6.9 vs. 46.9 +/- 6.2 minutes, p less than 0.004) were significantly prolonged after direct mechanical ventricular actuation versus cardiopulmonary bypass, respectively. Similar trends were noted in the epicardium and right ventricular regions; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Left ventricular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were better preserved after direct mechanical ventricular actuation (22 +/- 1.5 mumols/g dry wt) compared with cardiopulmonary bypass (17 +/- 1.9 mumols/g dry wt). The depletion of left ventricular endocardium ATP during normothermic ischemia was significantly delayed after direct mechanical ventricular actuation compared with cardiopulmonary bypass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Age at transplantation ranged from 3 months to 18 years (mean, 11.3 years) with follow-up ranging from 3.5 to 54 months (mean, 21.6 months). There were seven late deaths and two patients with retransplantations. Of nine grafts lost, eight were due to acute rejection, and one was due to coronary disease. Four of the grafts lost were secondary to patient noncompliance with prescribed immunosuppression. The mean rejection frequency more than 1 year after cardiac transplantation was significantly higher in those patients who eventually lost their grafts; however, these patients could not be distinguished by their rejection frequency in the first year. Eight patients had coronary disease, with five diagnosed at autopsy, two at cardiac retransplantation, and one by angiography. All eight patients were on double immunosuppression; none of the 19 patients on triple therapy had coronary disease with similar follow-up. There were 12 serious infections in eight patients (four associated with OKT3) with no deaths. Five patients had arrhythmias requiring treatment including two pacemakers; four of the five were associated with rejection episodes. Twelve of 29 patients developed early hypertension, and five developed late hypertension (greater than 1 year). There were two malignancies; one patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma was cured with chemotherapy, and one patient with histiocytic lymphoma was discovered at autopsy.

A retrospective review was done of patients referred for heart transplantation who were not considered candidates for conventional cardiac surgery, yet instead underwent reparative procedures rather than transplantation. Of 23 adult patients referred during a 7-year period, 18 had coronary artery disease, and five had valvular heart disease. All had New York Heart Association class IV symptoms. Preoperative left ventricular ejection fractions were in the range 0.08-0.63 (mean, 0.28). Ten of 18 patients with coronary artery disease required insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump for hemodynamic support perioperatively. Seven patients had primary coronary artery bypass grafts, and 10 had reoperative coronary bypass procedures. One patient had a left ventricular aneurysmectomy, and one had endocardial stripping in addition to myocardial revascularization procedures. Of the patients with valvular disease, three had aortic valve replacement, of which two were reoperations, and two others had mitral valve replacements with tricuspid annuloplasties. With a mean follow-up of 25 months, 1-, 3-, 12-, and 24-month actuarial survival rates were 91%, 87%, 82%, and 76%, respectively. One patient who underwent aortic valve replacement in this study successfully received heart transplantation 19 months postoperatively.

To assess the optimal temperature for donor myocardium preservation, the recovery of isolated canine hearts (n = 20) exposed to 4 hours of either standard ice-chest hypothermia (0-4 degrees C) or constant moderate hypothermia (12 degrees C) were compared. Functional and metabolic data were acquired before hypothermia and every 30 minutes during 3 hours of reperfusion with oxygenated blood. Mean end-systolic pressure-volume slopes were 2.11 +/- 0.06 and 2.09 +/- 0.06 mm Hg/ml for ice-chest hypothermia and constant moderate hypothermia, respectively (p = NS), which were unchanged from control. All y intercepts during reperfusion were decreased compared with control (p = 0.002) without any differences between groups. End-diastolic pressures were greater than control throughout the reperfusion period for both groups (p = 0.02), but there was a difference in change of end-diastolic pressures with time between groups (p = 0.04). Dry/wet ratios were similar after preservation and reperfusion in both groups. ATP recovered to control levels during reperfusion for both groups although energy charge ratios were greater for hearts exposed to constant moderate hypothermia (p = 0.007). These data indicate that intracellular energy stores are well maintained by preservation using either technique. Changes in function appear to be related to altered compliance irrespective of preservation temperature. These data suggest that a wide range of temperatures may be acceptable for donor heart preservation.\r"

Junctional bradycardia occurred in 50 (69%) recipients, sinus bradycardia in 18 (25%), and slow ventricular response during atrial fibrillation in four (6%). Fifty-five of 72 (76%) patients had bradyarrhythmias of less than 20 days' duration (less than 7 days, 50 patients; 7-20 days, five patients). Fifty patients returned to sinus rhythm (greater than 60 beats/min) by the time of discharge. Five patients expired within 20 days. Seventeen of 72 (24%) patients had bradyarrhythmia for more than 20 days, which was symptomatic in 11. All 17 patients (junctional bradycardia, 13 patients; sinus bradycardia, four patients) received a permanent pacemaker within 40 days after transplantation. Between 1 and 12 months (mean, 4 +/- 3 months) after pacemaker implantation, 12 patients recovered sinus rhythm (greater than 70 beats/min). The other five patients had intrinsic rates of 32-57 beats/min (mean, 48 +/- 10 beats/min) during 1-9 months (mean, 4 +/- 3 months) of follow-up. The donor ischemic time in bradyarrhythmia patients was 202 +/- 34 minutes, which was significantly longer (p less than 0.01) than the 173 +/- 43 minutes for those patients without bradyarrhythmia. Conclusively, the incidence of posttransplantation bradyarrhythmia is relatively high. It is usually temporary, however, even in patients with a prolonged duration of bradyarrhythmia. A relation appears to exist between donor ischemic time and the incidence of bradyarrhythmia.\r"

Between patients with and without a successful bridge, there were no significant differences in preoperative hepatorenal function or postoperative hemodynamics, but there were significant differences in body size. When recipients were divided according to body surface areas of less than or greater than 1.8 m2, the smaller patients more frequently developed respirator dependence (73% vs. 18%, p less than 0.01), renal failure (53% vs. 18%, p less than 0.05), and hepatic failure and sepsis, resulting in less frequent qualification for transplantation (20% vs. 65%, p less than 0.05). There were no successful bridge operations in seven patients with body surface areas of less than 1.7 m2, and only one success in nine patients who were less than 170 cm in height, despite use of a smaller stroke volume model. The smaller patients had poorer ventricular filling, which was largely compensated for by the drive controls set for significantly longer diastole and higher vacuum, resulting in similar hemodynamics between the groups. The results suggest that device fitting as manifested by body size is an important factor affecting major organ recovery and subsequent transplantation in recipients of the Jarvik-7 artificial heart. A paracorporeal device may be advisable for patients with body surface areas of less than 1.8 m2 or who were less than 175 cm in height until an even smaller model with a better fit in the thorax becomes available.\r"

Hypertrophied hearts have been demonstrated to have an increased vulnerability to ischemia/reperfusion injury. We studied the effects of the iron chelator and hydroxyl radical scavenger deferoxamine given during early reperfusion in a model of isolated retroperfused rabbit hearts made hypertrophic by aortic banding early in life (1 week of age). The rabbits were studied at 6-8 weeks of age, and the hearts were subjected to 30 minutes of 37 degrees C ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. Postischemic recovery of isovolumic developed pressure was measured by using an intracavitary balloon in both the untreated (n = 6) and the deferoxamine-treated (n = 6) groups and compared with normal age-matched controls. Deferoxamine (50 mumol/kg) was given to one group with the hypertrophied hearts during the first 10 minutes of reperfusion. The left ventricular weight/body weight ratio in the hypertrophied hearts was 2.9 +/- 0.4 x 10(-3) (n = 14) versus 2.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) in the age-matched controls (p less than 0.05). Postischemic peak developed pressure recovered to 102 +/- 6% of the preischemic value in the normal hearts after 30 minutes of reperfusion compared with 75 +/- 5% for the untreated and 71 +/- 4% for the deferoxamine-treated hearts (p less than 0.05 vs. control). We conclude that chronic hypertrophy from early in life leads to increased susceptibility to ischemia and that the iron chelator deferoxamine is not effective in preventing the injury of reperfusion in hypertrophied hearts.\r"

Myocardial adenine nucleotide concentrations decreased with cardioplegia and reperfusion in both the right and left ventricles despite adequate levels of precursors, suggesting perioperative mitochondrial dysfunction. Postoperatively, right and left ventricular pressures were measured with micromanometer catheters and volumes were measured by nuclear ventriculography. Right and left ventricular systolic elastance was calculated by the isochronic method and by the end-systolic method. Both methods provided sensitive indexes of end-systolic elastance. This study demonstrated that right ventricular function and metabolism can be evaluated by methods analogous to methods used in the left ventricle. These results suggest that right ventricular functional and metabolic recovery are delayed despite apparently adequate myocardial protection. Sensitive measurements may permit improved assessment of alternative methods of right ventricular protection.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to determine the dual role of ATP as an energy substrate and as a major source of oxygen-derived free-radical-mediated reperfusion injury by using adenine nucleoside blocker, p-nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), and adenosine deaminase inhibitor, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA). In a randomized study, 16 dogs were instrumented with minor-axis LTZ-piezoelectric crystals and intraventricular pressure transducers to monitor, off bypass, left ventricular performance by using a sensitive and load-independent index of contractility (slope of the stroke work-end-diastolic length relation). Hearts were subjected to 60 minutes of normothermic global ischemia and 120 minutes of reperfusion. Normal saline without (Group 1, n = 8) or with (Group 2, n = 8) NBMPR and EHNA was infused in three boluses into the cardiopulmonary bypass reservoir before ischemia and reperfusion. Transmural serial biopsies were obtained before and during ischemia and reperfusion and analyzed for myocardial adenine nucleotide pool intermediates by using high-performance liquid chromatography. In the control group, three hearts developed ischemic contracture and another three hearts exhibited cardiogenic shock during reperfusion. In the EHNA/NBMPR-treated group, left ventricular performance recovered within 30 minutes of reperfusion (p less than 0.05 vs. control). Myocardial ATP was depleted to 20% of normal in both groups by the end of ischemia (p less than 0.05). Intramyocardial adenosine in the EHNA/NBMPR-treated group was 12-fold greater (15.09 +/- 1.6 nmol/mg protein) than the control group at the end of the ischemic period (p less than 0.05). Inosine was about fourfold higher in the control group (19.07 +/- 1.50 nmol/mg protein) compared with the drug-treated group (p less than 0.05). During reperfusion, myocardial ATP levels increased to approximately 50% of normal in the EHNA/NBMPR group while remaining depressed (20% of normal) in the control group. Thus, despite the dramatic loss of myocardial ATP during ischemia, complete recovery of ventricular performance and significant repletion of ATP during reperfusion were observed when adenosine transport and deamination were modulated during ischemia and reperfusion. These results suggest that 1) the myocardium may have more ATP than is needed for basic cardiac functions and 2) washout of ATP diffusible catabolites is detrimental to ventricular performance during reperfusion. Specific blockade of nucleoside transport resulted in complete functional recovery despite low but critical ATP levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These components have the potential to enhance the preservation of ATP, reduce intracellular and extracellular edema, and attenuate free-radical-mediated injury. The University of Wisconsin solution has been demonstrated to enhance and extend the preservation of the liver, pancreas, and kidney, but its potential role in the heart remains unproven. We have evaluated the University of Wisconsin solution (Du Pont) by comparing it with the St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solutions No. 1 and No. 2 (Plegisol), which are used in Europe and the United States for routine cardiac surgery and transplantation. For each solution, 10 isolated working rat hearts were arrested by 10 ml of the solution (at 4 degrees C) and then maintained immersed in the same solution for 4 hours at 4 degrees C. Mean recovery of functional indexes (expressed as a percentage of their preischemic control values) after use of the University of Wisconsin solution were as follows: peak aortic pressure, 90.6 +/- 1.0; dP/dt, 71.5 +/- 5.5; aortic flow, 81.6 +/- 4.7; coronary flow, 87.5 +/- 3.5; and cardiac output, 82.6 +/- 3.5.

Isovolumic hemodynamic function was monitored, and adenine nucleotide pool was measured in myocardial biopsy specimens and coronary sinus effluent. The treatment group of pigs (n = 7) received 15 mg/kg r-HSOD immediately before warm reperfusion, both left ventricular peak systolic pressure and developed pressure were significantly better in the r-HSOD group of pigs (p less than 0.05 vs. placebo). This improvement persisted at 60 minutes of reperfusion (p less than 0.05 vs. placebo). Myocardial ATP and total adenine nucleotides did not differ, nor did adenine nucleotide catabolites in the coronary sinus effluent differ between treatment groups of pigs. The exception to this was the nucleotide catabolite inosine, which was significantly elevated in coronary sinus effluent of pigs treated with r-HSOD at 30 minutes of reperfusion (p less than 0.05 vs. placebo). In this model of global ischemia and reperfusion, a recombinant-derived human free-radical scavenger provides significant protection of systolic but not diastolic function. Values for myocardial ATP and total adenine nucleotide content suggest that the improvement in mechanical function during reperfusion is not due to enhanced preservation of myocardial bioenergetics.\r"

The myocardial contractile response to citrate infusion was compared in neonatal and adult rabbit hearts using clinically comparable citrate-phosphate-dextrose concentrations. Isovolumic left ventricular pressures were monitored in an isolated, crystalloid-perfused heart model before, during, and after 15 minutes of citrate-phosphate-dextrose infusion. Developed pressure decreased 42.1 +/- 4.9% from control within 1 minute in the neonatal group versus 24.3 +/- 4.3% in the adult group (p less than 0.02). The effect on diastolic function was paradoxical in the neonate with a 43.1 +/- 11.9% increase in end-diastolic pressure compared with a 9.7 +/- 7.8% decrease in the adult (p less than 0.01). These results indicate that the neonatal heart appears more sensitive to the myocardial effects of citrate infusion with impairment of both systolic and diastolic function. The decreased ventricular compliance in the neonate with citrate-phosphate-dextrose suggests that the myocardial effects may not be simply due to changes in ionized calcium concentration.\r"

The effect of serum ionized Ca2+ concentration on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function after ischemia was studied in 5-7-day-old piglets undergoing a 90-minute period of cold-blood cardioplegic arrest. In the control group, Ca2+ was maintained at 1.2 mM (Group A [n = 6]). The cardioplegic solution and bypass perfusate were modified to achieve a low Ca2+ concentration, 0.25 mM, in Group B (n = 6). Left ventricular pressure-volume loops were acquired by using high-fidelity pressure-sensor-tipped and volume-conductance catheters. Ventricular function was assessed from the slope of end-systolic (Ees) and end-diastolic (k) pressure-volume relations during transient caval occlusion. Both groups showed a significant reduction in Ees after ischemia (p less than 0.05). Intergroup comparison of Ees after ischemia demonstrated a better recovery of the systolic function in the low Ca2+ group, 64 +/- 7% versus 49 +/- 6% in the normal Ca2+ group (p = 0.05). There was a significant increase in chamber stiffness index in group A (k, 0.48 +/- 0.06 to 0.65 +/- 0.05 ml-1, p less than 0.01) versus no significant change in group B. This study shows 1) the feasibility of acquiring continuous pressure-volume data in neonatal hearts by using a conductance catheter system, and 2) better preservation of systolic function and diastolic compliance in normal newborn myocardium by low Ca2+ concentration in the peri-ischemic period.\r"

  ".W": "As part of a prospective program to use risk-adjusted outcome (operative mortality and morbidity) as a measure of quality of care, we have analyzed perioperative complication data in 10,634 patients representing 73% of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass at Veterans Administration medical centers between April 1, 1987, and March 31, 1989. One or more complications occurred in 15% of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, and in 24% of patients undergoing valve and other cardiac surgery. Patients experiencing one or more complications had an eightfold to 10-fold increase in operative mortality compared with patients with no perioperative complications. The most frequent complication was requirement for mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours occurring in 8% of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass and in 15% of patients undergoing valve and other cardiac surgery; 24-25% of these patients died within 30 days of surgery or as a direct result of a surgical complication. Previous heart surgery was a strong predictor of development of one or more complications in both groups of patients, being associated with an adjusted relative risk of 1.6-2.0. Other important predictors in both surgical groups were surgical priority, older age, peripheral vascular disease, and higher serum creatinine. Although a number of preoperative risk factors could be identified for the development of renal failure, low cardiac output, and requirement for prolonged mechanical support, few risk factors could be identified for the development of mediastinitis and reoperation for bleeding. This observation suggests that mediastinitis and reoperation for bleeding are more likely the result of technical factors rather than patient-related risk factors.\r"

Group 3 medical and surgical subgroups were well matched for baseline characteristics and were potential candidates for either mode of therapy. By Cox model analysis, significant predictors of mortality were pleural rupture, other dissection complications, increasing age, and cardiac disease (all p less than 0.01). Surgical versus medical therapy was not an independent determinant of survival in any of the three groups for acute or chronic dissection. Survival probabilities for all group 3 patients at 1, 5, and 10 years were 0.94, 0.87, and 0.32 (medical) and 0.90, 0.80, and 0.50 (surgical). Despite the limitations of this retrospective study (including the possibility of undefined treatment selection biases), these data suggest that medical or early surgical therapy is associated with equivalent outcome in selected patients with uncomplicated acute or chronic descending aortic dissection.\r"

We assessed the effects of the iron chelator deferoxamine on the susceptibility of circulating low density lipoproteins (LDLs) to induced peroxidation in 20 adult patients (10 controls and 10 treated) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary or valve procedures. Deferoxamine was given both intravenously (30 mg/kg body wt, starting 30 minutes before bypass and extending for the next 4 hours) and as an additive to the cardioplegic solution (250 mg/l). Blood samples were taken from both atria before and immediately after the end of cardiopulmonary bypass. Plasma lipid peroxidation was assessed by measuring spectrophotometrically the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content of selectively isolated LDLs after their exposure to a peroxidizing agent. Before cardiopulmonary bypass, the right and left atrial blood values of LDL-TBARS were not significantly different between the two groups. Cardiopulmonary bypass resulted in a lipid peroxidation of significantly greater magnitude in control than in treated patients. Postbypass right atrial values for LDL-TBARS (expressed in mumol/mmol LDL-phospholipids) were 45.7 +/- 17.2 (mean +/- SEM) in control patients and 6.9 +/- 2.9 in treated patients (p less than 0.02), whereas in the left atrial blood, LDL-TBARS yielded values of 62.7 +/- 20.5 and 10.3 +/- 3.9, respectively (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The acute hemodynamic and echocardiographic effects of pericardial closure on cardiac function were studied in 11 pigs during steady-state anesthesia and ventilation. Observations were made after sternotomy, both while the pericardium was open and after it had been closed, and then after closure of the chest, after the pericardium had been reopened by removing the pericardial suture through the chest wall. In five pigs, further observations were made when a suture was tightened to close the pericardium while the chest remained closed. Closure of the pericardium when the chest was open reduced cardiac output by 14% and mean stroke volume by 19% (both p less than 0.05). Systemic vascular resistance increased by 15% when the pericardium was closed while the chest was open (NS), and increased by 19% when it was closed while the chest was closed (p less than 0.05). Heart rate did not change significantly, and the systemic blood pressure was maintained (-8%, NS). All these effects were reversed by opening the pericardium. Intrathoracic epicardial echocardiographic monitoring of the left ventricle showed that its end-diastolic dimension increased (by 11%, p less than 0.05) when the pericardium was opened. After chest closure, paradoxical motion of the interventricular septum was consistently demonstrated only during ventilation, and it was not related to whether or not the pericardium was open. This study suggests that cardiac function may be impaired by pericardial closure after cardiac surgery because of some degree of constriction of the heart chambers, although acute circulatory responses compensate for the mild decrease in stroke volume. Monitoring of blood pressure alone cannot document the subtle circulatory changes induced by pericardial closure, and therefore it is not a reliable guide to decisions of whether to close the pericardium or leave it open in individual patients.\r"

In a study of 23 patients (11 diabetics and 12 age-matched controls), cerebral blood flow was measured using 133Xe clearance during nonpulsatile, alpha-stat blood gas managed cardiopulmonary bypass at the conditions of hypothermia and normothermia. In diabetic patients, the cerebral blood flow at 26.6 +/- 2.42 degrees C was 25.3 +/- 14.34 ml/100 g/min and at 36.9 +/- 0.58 degrees C it was 27.3 +/- 7.40 ml/100 g/min (p = NS). The control patients increased cerebral blood flow from 20.7 +/- 6.78 ml/100 g/min at 28.4 +/- 2.81 degrees C to 37.6 +/- 8.81 ml/100 g/min at 36.5 +/- 0.45 degrees C (p less than or equal to 0.005). The oxygen consumption was calculated from jugular bulb effluent and increased from hypothermic values of 0.52 +/- 0.20 ml/100 g/min in diabetics to 1.26 +/- 0.28 ml/100 g/min (p = 0.001) at normothermia and rose from 0.60 +/- 0.27 to 1.49 +/- 0.35 ml/100 g/min (p = 0.0005) in the controls. Thus, despite temperature-mediated changes in oxygen consumption, diabetic patients did not increase cerebral blood flow as metabolism increased. Arteriovenous oxygen saturation gradients and oxygen extraction across the brain were calculated from arterial and jugular bulb blood samples. The increase in arteriovenous oxygen difference between temperature conditions in diabetic patients and controls was significantly different (p = 0.01). These data reveal that diabetic patients lose cerebral autoregulation during cardiopulmonary bypass and compensate for an imbalance in adequate oxygen delivery by increasing oxygen extraction.\r"

We examined the effect of DDAVP in a prospective study of 60 patients undergoing uncomplicated primary coronary artery bypass grafting operations. Thirty consecutive patients received DDAVP (0.3 micrograms/kg) after cardiopulmonary bypass and were compared with 30 consecutive patients who did not receive DDAVP. No significant differences were seen in 12-hour mediastinal blood loss (465 +/- 207 ml with DDAVP versus 511 +/- 221 ml without DDAVP) or 12-24-hour mediastinal blood loss (236 +/- 127 ml with DDAVP versus 260 +/- 112 ml without DDAVP). Transfusion of blood products were similar for both groups. Platelet aggregometry at intraoperative and postoperative time points using ADP, collagen, and ristocetin was not significantly different from baseline values in either group. In a subgroup of patients with poor initial ristocetin-induced platelet aggregometry, a significant increase (p less than 0.05) in ristocetin-induced platelet aggregometry was seen postoperatively only in those patients who had received DDAVP. A decrease in blood loss and transfusions, however, was not demonstrable. In those patients who had been on aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs preoperatively, DDAVP did not improve mediastinal blood loss or transfusion needs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess the factors that may contribute to changes in CSF pressure during aortic surgery, measurements of ascending arterial and CSF pressures were made in 17 anesthetized mongrel dogs. Changes in CSF patterns were monitored under several conditions tested in random sequence. These included systemic hypertension produced by an infusion of phenylephrine, cross-clamping of the descending thoracic aorta, and manual, superior displacement of the transverse aortic arch (arch elevation), either alone or in conjunction with the cross-clamp. Hypertension, cross-clamping, and cross-clamping combined with arch elevation all produced significant increases in ascending mean arterial pressure (204 +/- 20, 170 +/- 8, and 158 +/- 11 mm Hg, respectively, vs. 117 +/- 8 mm Hg [control]; (p less than 0.01). Small, nonsignificant increases in CSF pressure were detected in the cross-clamp group, but none were detected with hypertension alone, despite significant increases in ascending arterial blood pressure in both groups. Thus, neither arterial hypertension nor cross-clamping alone could be demonstrated directly to cause significant CSF hypertension. However, when aortic elevation (displacement) was combined with cross-clamping, the rise in CSF pressure increased to significant levels, even though the ascending arterial hypertension was least severe in this group. In contrast, arch elevation alone did not produce any significant increase in ascending arterial pressure but did produce an approximately 114% increase in CSF pressure (15.2 +/- mm Hg vs. 7.7 +/- 1 mm Hg [control]; p less than 0.01.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Results were compared with data from three pigs instrumented with a continuous radiopaque marker on the anulus. Pump function of all hearts with annuloplasty rings and function of the mitral valve were studied 4-6 weeks after the operation, first in the exposed heart and then subsequently in the isolated heart in a perfusion chamber at maximal filling pressure and normal or low arterial pressure. Separation of the blood-perfused coronary circulation from the crystalline solution pumped by the left heart allowed videoendoscopy of the working valve. Flexible rings interfered less with normal movements of the mitral anulus than rigid rings and caused less impairment of filling of the basal part of the ventricle, and the unloaded stroke volume was 16% larger. For normal arterial pressures, the differences were smaller and will be difficult to detect in clinical situations. A stiff anulus was seen to be pushed underneath the aortic valve during systole, which caused a mild subvalvular obstruction. The mean diastolic pressure gradient across rigid annuloplasty rings was slightly larger than across flexible rings of the same or slightly smaller diastolic size. Rigid rings change the pattern of movement of the leaflets; the mural leaflet remains immobile throughout diastole. Although Duran rings interfere less with valvular function and filling of the basal part of the ventricle than do Carpentier rings, the differences are small and probably only of limited clinical importance.\r"

We therefore studied 75 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement who were randomized to receive either Hancock (n = 35) or Carpentier-Edwards (n = 40) bioprosthetic valves. Pressure gradients were measured using transducer-tipped catheters to record left ventricular and left atrial pressures and cardiac outputs by thermodilution. Repeated measurements were made in each patient after either pacing, fluid infusion, or pharmacological intervention to vary flow rates for a total of 239 measurements (mean, 3.2 measurements per patient). Using analyses of variance and covariance, mean valve gradients and the calculated Gorlin area were adjusted for flow rate, valve size, valve type, and interpatient differences to compare hemodynamics. Without flow and interpatient adjustment, the univariate analysis suggested higher mean gradients in the Carpentier-Edwards 29-mm valves (p = 0.038), with a trend toward higher gradients and smaller areas in the Hancock 33-mm valves (p = 0.057 and 0.059, respectively). After adjustment for flow rate and interpatient differences, however, there was no difference at any valve size in the mean pressure gradients (p = 0.13-0.89) or Gorlin valve areas (p = 0.34-0.96). Although measurements within a given patient were consistent, marked interpatient variabilities in gradients and areas were observed for identical valve types and sizes, which were as significant as flow-dependent or size-dependent changes. We conclude that comparisons of valve performance should adjust for variations in flow rate and for interpatient differences with the use of repeated-measures designs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relative importance of the anterolateral (ANTLAT) and posteromedial (POSTMED) papillary muscle (PM) chordae tendineae for left ventricular (LV) segmental wall function was assessed in 12 in situ ejecting canine hearts. Pairs of piezoelectric crystals were placed in the regions subtending PM insertions and the ANTLAT LV free wall to measure wall thickness. After mitral valve replacement with complete preservation of the subvalvular apparatus, chordal attachments to either the ANTLAT PM or POSTMED PM were randomly severed using exteriorized snares, followed by subsequent division of the remaining chordae tendineae. Segmental wall function in each region was determined at each stage by segmental preload recruitable stroke work (sPRSW, slope of the segmental stroke work-end-diastolic wall thickness relation). The order in which the chordae were severed was unimportant (p greater than 0.530 in all regions). When the ANTLAT PM chordae were severed first, there were significant declines in sPRSW without a change in the wall thickness intercept in both the ANTLAT (-71.0 +/- 18.3 vs. -57.7 +/- 16.8 mmHg, p less than 0.05) and POSTMED (-81.8 +/- 23.1 vs. -65.4 +/- 17.3 mmHg, p less than 0.05) PM insertion sites. No further significant reductions in sPRSW in either region were detected after severing the remaining chordal attachments to the POSTMED PM. sPRSW in the ANTLAT LV free wall decreased progressively, reaching statistical significance when both sets of chordae tendineae were divided (-88.3 +/- 14.3 vs. -74.0 +/- 15.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). When the POSTMED PM chordae were severed first, no significant changes in sPRSW or the wall thickness intercept in either region of PM insertion were detected. Subsequent division of the ANTLAT PM chordal attachments reduced sPRSW significantly in both the ANTLAT PM (-65.9 +/- 21.1 vs. -56.1 +/- 22.1 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and POSTMED PM (-78.8 +/- 24.7 vs. -67.2 +/- 24.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) insertion sites, without a shift in the wall thickness intercept. In the ANTLAT LV free wall, sPRSW again fell progressively, achieving statistical significance only when both chordal attachments were severed (-78.6 +/- 14.8 vs. -62.2 +/- 13.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, division of the chordae tendineae resulted in a decline in segmental LV function not only in the areas subtending PM insertions but also in remote LV regions. Furthermore, the influence of the ANTLAT PM chordae predominated local LV systolic function at both PM insertion sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We assessed the reversibility of functional and morphological changes of arterialized vein segments by returning them to the venous circulation. Thirteen dogs underwent right carotid and femoral veno-arterial grafting. After 12 weeks, veno-arterial grafts were removed for contractility (norepinephrine [NE] and 5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), luminal prostacyclin (PGI2), and morphometric analyses; the remaining segments were used as left jugular and femoral veno-venous grafts. After another 12 weeks, the veno-venous grafts were harvested. To NE, veno-arterial grafts (ED50, 5.4 +/- 0.1 [-log M]) were less sensitive than control veins (ED50, 6.0 +/- 0.2) or veno-venous grafts (ED50, 6.4 +/- 0.2) but were more sensitive than control arteries (ED50, 4.0 +/- 0.1); the maximum tension of veno-arterial grafts (6.2 +/- 0.6 g) was greater than that of veins, less than that of arteries (9.8 +/- 1.0 g), and comparable with that of veno-venous grafts (5.1 +/- 1.1 g). To 5-HT, veno-arterial (ED50, 7.5 +/- 0.1) and veno-venous (ED50, 7.3 +/- 0.2) grafts were more sensitive than arteries (ED50, 6.0 +/- 0.3), while the vein was unresponsive; the maximum tension of veno-arterial grafts (5.0 +/- 0.7 g) was less than that of arteries (6.9 +/- 0.9 g) and greater than that of veno-venous grafts (1.4 +/- 0.3 g). PGI2 production in veins (3.6 +/- 0.8 ng/ml), veno-arterial grafts (3.9 +/- 0.8 ng/ml), and veno-venous grafts (3.3 +/- 0.9 ng/ml) was comparable and less than that of arteries (6.4 +/- 0.9 ng/ml). Veno-arterial graft intimal thickness (127 +/- 8 microns) and intimal area (15.6 +/- 1.8 x 10(3) microns 2) tended to be greater than that in the veno-venous graft (113 +/- 9 microns and 12.4 +/- 1.8 x 10(3) microns 2); also, the veno-arterial graft medial area (103.0 +/- 7.3 x 10(3) microns 2) was greater than that of the veno-venous graft (80.3 +/- 6.9 x 10(3) microns 2), thereby resulting in a similar relative intimal area (13 +/- 1%). Therefore, some changes associated with arterialization, for example, adrenergic sensitivity, maximum tension to 5-HT, medial thickening, and perhaps intimal hyperplasia, reverted toward venous values when replaced in the venous environment, possibly due to variations in pressure, flow, shear stress, and/or graft preparation techniques. Luminal PGI2 was unchanged in the grafts, implying that graft contractility was not modulated by luminal PGI2.\r"

Seventy-two patients (ages 2-12 years) entered a prospective trial in which the operation was performed either with normal gauze swabs or calcium alginate swabs. Thirty-six children were randomized to each group. The mean blood loss was found to be 34.9 ml (2.07% of total blood volume) and 47.8 ml (2.97% of total blood volume) respectively. Although there was no significant reduction in operative blood loss using calcium alginate, in both groups the blood loss was much smaller than that stated by the majority of previous workers.\r"

Preoperative assessment included a detailed parental history, physical examination, and lateral cephalometry, in order to identify factors that might alert the clinician to a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea. There were 2 equal groups of snorers and non-snorers (grade 0); 1 patient was found to have the sleep apnoea syndrome (IV), 9 patients had obstructive snoring with apnoeic episodes (III), 3 patients had snoring with a disrupted sleep pattern (II), and 12 patients snored with no disruption of sleep (I). In identifying patients with apnoea, a history of snoring was unhelpful, whereas one of breathing irregularities was found to be highly specific. Nasal obstruction correlated poorly; however, there was a significant relationship between tonsillar position and size and sleep grade (Chi-squared P less than 0.01). Stepwise regression analysis showed a large contribution to the grading was made by the size of the oropharyngeal airway measured by lateral cephalometry. The children in grade II-IV were re-studied 3 months post-operatively and all reverted to grades 0 or I.\r"

Their ease of passage is determined by the size of the tube and is probably also related to the ease with which a preparation wets the surface of the grommet. There is no relationship between ease of penetration and viscosity. The penetration of ear drops through grommets during episodes of aural discharge was studied in vivo. Penetration into the middle ear was observed only when the drops were introduced using the displacement technique. It was more readily achieved when the grommet lumen was free of discharge.\r"

Mini-Wright peak flow meters were used. The peak flow nasal patency index was defined as the ratio between nasal and oral peak flow rates. Uni and bi-lateral, as well as ex and in-spiratory, indices were calculated. Both peak ex and in-spiratory flow nasal patency indices were significantly increased 1 and 6 months post-operatively, indicating improved nasal patency. The most marked post-operative increase of the nasal patency indices was seen for the preoperatively worst airway and the total airway. A weak significant positive correlation was found between the peak flow nasal patency indices and the patient mean self-assessment scores of the uni and bi-lateral nasal obstruction. The change of the peak flow nasal patency indices measured 6 months post-operatively correlated well with the patient overall assessment of the operative changes of the total nasal patency. The method was found quick and easy to handle in monitoring the effect of functional septoplasty and is recommended as an alternative to rhinomanometry.\r"

Radical trimming significantly reduced nasal resistance at 2 months following operation (n = 12) (P less than 0.005). There was no significant change in nasal resistance over the next 20 months. Symptom scores for nasal obstruction also showed a significant reduction (n = 16) (P less than 0.005), at 2 months, and did not change significantly over the next 20 months. Radical trimming of the inferior turbinates is a highly effective operation in patients with hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates with few initial complications. However, further analysis of the data revealed that up to 20% of patients lose the initial subjective benefit of relief of nasal obstruction within 2 years of follow-up. Late onset crusting occurs in some patients though this is not directly attributable to an increase in nasal airflow. This study also concludes that anterior trimming of the inferior turbinates cannot be recommended as a form of treatment.\r"

Light and electron-microscopic examination revealed good middle ear tolerance of the material, especially when the surface had not been modelled. Our animal experiments suggest that this material could be suitable for ventilation tubes, but was less ideal for ossicular replacement prostheses, particularly because of the specific surface properties. Consequently, we have used such carbon ventilation tubes in 38 patients. The results obtained using this material were excellent thanks to the favourable biocompatibility, advantageous surface properties, and low weight.\r"

We conclude that the milder clinical course in such patients is most likely to be due to host factors, rather than to viral factors.\r"

  ".W": "In order to improve our possibility of establishing a long-term prognosis in IgA nephritis, 73 patients out of a cohort of 282, followed over a mean period of 12 years at the same institution for an IgA nephritis, had a prospective second renal biopsy 5 years later. For all biopsies (RB1 and RB2), we developed a quantitative scoring for all elementary lesions with a glomerular, an interstitial, a tubular and a vascular index. The sum of these 4 indexes gave a global optical score (GOS). Pathological improvement on light microscopy (delta GOS less than or equal to -2) was noticed only in 3 patients (4%), stability (-2 less than delta GOS less than +2) in 30 patients (41%), mild deterioration (+2 less than or equal to GOS less than 5) in 23 patients (32%) and major progression (delta GOS greater than or equal to 5) in 17 patients (23%). We observed no pathological remission, even in the 14 patients with complete clinical remission. The pathological progression was characterized by an increase in all elementary lesions, mainly the tubulo-interstitial and vascular ones. By immunofluorescence mesangial IgA deposits remained stable with no disappearance; however, the number and intensity of vascular C3 deposits were significantly greater on RB2. Chronic renal failure (serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dl) correlated best with major pathological progression and mainly with the progression of extraglomerular lesions. IgA nephritis is a slowly progressive disease with no pathological remission, and its evolution is characterized by progression of extraglomerular lesions, mainly vascular, which might play a major role in the ultimate development of chronic renal failure.\r"

Renal biopsy specimens revealed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis with strongly positive IgA deposits in the glomerular mesangial area, which is histologically indistinguishable from primary IgA nephritis. Further studies of the IgA subclasses showed that IgA1 deposits were predominant in the glomerular mesangium. Primary IgA nephritis is thought to be associated with polymeric IgA1. So it appears that there may be a common underlying disease or mechanism involved in both primary IgA nephritis and the IgA nephritis in Behcet's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Glomerular immunopathology was studied in 25 patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease. None had clinical signs of renal disease. Glomeruli were obtained by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The specimens were processed and studied by indirect immunofluorescence for immunoglobulins and complement. Mesangial IgA was found in 8 of the patients. It occurred occasionally together with slight IgG or IgM, but C3 was not seen in these patients. IgA-class circulating immune complexes (CIC), antireticulin antibodies (ARA), antigliadin antibodies (AGA), and rheumatoid factor (RF) occurred significantly more often in the patients with mesangial IgA than in the 17 patients having no mesangial IgA. The patients with mesangial IgA also had significantly higher mean levels of serum IgA, IgA-ARA and IgA-AGA than those without. The results suggest that glomerular mesangial deposits of IgA occur frequently in untreated celiac disease and that they are in some way associated with circulating IgA-class antibodies and immune complexes. In this situation IgA seems to be deposited without being able to induce clinically overt glomerulonephritis, a circumstance that may be related to the lack of complement in the deposits.\r"

Many were referred when renal function was deteriorating despite large doses of prednisone. The patients had severe disease; there was a high degree of glomerular sclerosis; the median serum creatinine was 137 mumol/l, the diastolic blood pressure 101 mm Hg. Reported previously was a short-term improvement in renal function, blood pressure, and renal histology. Reported here is the long-term follow-up on all 22 patients for an average of 58 months. Three died of causes other than renal failure. Eleven developed end-stage renal disease an average of 27 months after ancrod treatment. The other 8 are alive with no deterioration of renal function after an average of 70 months. This outcome seems satisfactory when disease severity is taken into consideration. Factors present at treatment start that might be associated with subsequent renal function deterioration were: prior prolonged prednisone treatment, extensive glomerular sclerosis, high plasma alpha 2-antiplasmin and possibly triglycerides. During the follow-up period after completion of treatment, later relapses of SLE and DPLN appeared to be an important predictor of deterioration of renal function.\r"

The other three used standard bicarbonate dialyzate with either 1.25, 1.5 or 1.75 mmol/l calcium. Ionized calcium and intact parathyroid hormone (Nichols IRMA PTH) were measured at the start and end of each dialysis. Ionized calcium rose slightly with 15 ml/hour calcium infusion and PTH fell 137 +/- 111 pg/ml. These changes were similar to those of 1.5 mmol/l calcium in standard bicarbonate. More PTH suppression and higher end dialysis calcium resulted from 20 ml/hour infusion or 1.75 mmol/l dialyzate calcium. It was concluded that 15 ml/hour is a suitable calcium infusion rate under normal conditions when using calcium-free dialyzate.\r"

Haptoglobin was increased in 33.3% (p less than 0.01 vs controls). High levels of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor were present in 15.9% and 2.9%, respectively; these frequencies were not significantly different from controls. No differences between pre- and postdialysis values were observed. It is concluded that, unlike C-reactive protein, both alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor maintain an excellent specificity in hemodialysis patients. Vice versa, haptoglobin may be unreliable as an acute phase reactant in these patients because of the unacceptably high false-positive rate.\r"

At entry, the treated and untreated groups of patients did not differ in mean serum creatinines, urinary protein excretions, quantitative urinary erythrocyte counts or blood pressure readings. At the end of the trial mean (+/- SEM) serum creatinine values had gone from 0.12 +/- 0.01 to 0.13 +/- 0.01 mmol/l (p less than 0.05) in untreated patients and from 0.10 +/- 0.01 to 0.12 +/- 0.01 mmol/l (p less than 0.05) in treated patients. Mean (+/- SEM) log values of urinary erythrocyte (rbc) counts had not changed significantly from 5.47 +/- 0.09 to 5.21 +/- 0.14 log rbc/ml in untreated patients, from 5.45 +/- 0.11 to 5.49 +/- 0.19 log rbc/ml in treated patients. However, in treated patients, mean (+/- SEM) urinary protein excretions decreased from 1.67 +/- 0.35 to 1.15 +/- 0.31 g/24 h (p less than 0.01) whereas in untreated patients urinary protein was unchanged between initial values of 1.76 +/- 0.34 and follow-up at 1.89 +/- 0.45 g/24 h. No significant changes in blood pressure occurred in either group. This study supports the observation that treatment of IgA nephropathy with cyclophosphamide, dipyridamole and warfarin is associated with a reduction of urinary protein excretion but a significant effect on preservation of renal function, at least as determined by serum creatinine values, could not be confirmed over this two-year study.\r"

In seven patients (22%) antinuclear antibodies were demonstrated. In one patient with biopsy-proven membranous glomerulonephritis, the antinuclear antibodies consisted of antihistone antibodies. The observations presented in this report indicate that 2-MPG, like D-penicillamine, could induce autoimmune reactions, in some cases leading to membranous glomerulonephritis. The prognosis seemed to be favorable. However, the occurrence of irreversible glomerular lesions as reported by us should be borne in mind when considering long-term treatment with 2-MPG. A continuous, close follow-up of patients on 2-MPG treatment is recommended.\r"

Rarely, in the setting of intestinal bypass operations for morbid obesity, enteric hyperoxaluria has produced acute renal failure. We report two patients who suffered acute deterioration of renal function associated with increased intestinal absorption and renal excretion of oxalate associated with steatorrhea. One patient had a large portion of his small bowel resected many years prior to the onset of the renal failure and the second patient had chronic pancreatitis causing steatorrhea. Both patients had renal biopsy documentation of the acute nature of the tubular damage produced by oxalate deposition. The mechanisms of their deterioration of renal function may relate to sudden increases in steatorrhea in association with episodes of volume depletion. Enteric hyperoxaluria may be an easily overlooked and potentially preventable etiology of acute renal dysfunction.\r"

However, 24.5%, 22.4% and 6.1% of NIDDM subjects with normal Alb/Cr ratio had abnormal excretion of NAG, AAP and GGT, respectively. Alb/Cr ratio was greater than 26.8 mg/mmol (considered to be equivalent to albumin excretion of 250 mg/24 h) in 14.6% and between 2.5-26.8 mg/mmol (equivalent to albumin excretion rates of 20-250 mg/24 h) in 54.1% of subjects. In those diabetic subjects with clinical retinopathy only Alb/Cr ratio was higher. Arterial blood pressure was significantly correlated with Alb/Cr (r = 0.365) and NAG/Cr (r = 0.204).

  ".W": "The nature of immune complexes and their relationship to the normal glomerular basement membrane (GBM) components type IV collagen, fibronectin, and heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) have been examined in the glomeruli of 7 cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) glomerulonephritis using an ultrastructural immunogold technique. In paraformaldehyde-fixed, Lowicryl resin-embedded tissue, the electron-dense deposits contained IgG, IgM, IgA, and C3 whether they were subepithelial, intramembranous, subendothelial, or mesangial and there was no particular relationship between the class of immunoglobulin and site of immune complex localization within the glomerulus. The normal GBM components type IV collagen, fibronectin, and HSPG were found within all the glomeruli, but did not have the same distribution. Type IV collagen and fibronectin were found predominantly on the inner aspect of the GBM and diffusely throughout the more central regions of the mesangial matrix. By contrast the HSPG was seen mainly on the outer aspect of the GBM and at the periphery of the mesangial matrix. In none of the cases were GBM antigens localized within the electron-dense deposits, results which suggest that autoantibodies to these GBM components may not play a role in the development of the glomerulonephritis.\r"

Accurate diagnosis, judicious expectant management with transfusion as required, and delivery at the time of fetal lung maturation can lead to the most favorable outcome. Anticipation of the clinical complication of placenta accreta may avoid some serious consequences. Clinical judgement and skill in the performance of cesarean sections, dilatation and curettage, and other forms of uterine invasive techniques may help to keep subsequent incidence of placenta previa at a reasonably low rate.\r"

When the diagnosis of uterine rupture is suspected, prompt surgical intervention with an experienced pelvic surgeon and blood product replacement should be considered. At the time of uterine rupture, the patient should be evaluated for possible repair or hysterectomy. It appears, based on the aforementioned information, that repair is a reasonable consideration. In those patients who have undergone a repair, early delivery by elective cesarean after assessment of fetal lung maturity at or around 36 weeks gestation would appear prudent. In those patients with a prior cesarean, continuous electronic fetal monitoring to detect intrapartum fetal distress would appear prudent. In these patients fetal distress is the most common sign or symptom of uterine rupture and frequently precedes any other clinical manifestations of this complication.\r"

This approach ensures the most thorough assessment of the extent of the initial injury and allows rapid assessment of therapeutic maneuvers and their subsequent adjustment. Our goal is to reverse the initial insult early while avoiding further iatrogenic injury.

  ".W": "Significant advances in our understanding of neuroendocrinology of the human GnRH pulse generator have been accomplished in the last decade. In particular, inhibitory effects of endogenous and exogenous opiates, endogenous and exogenous androgens, and endogenous and exogenous estrogens on the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator have been inferred in men and/or women. Conversely, no definitive effects of serotonin and/or adrenergic agents have been reported. The overall role of dopamine in regulating the GnRH pulse generator in humans is not known because both facilitative effects of central dopamine and inhibitory effects of peripheral (extra blood-brain barrier) dopamine have been described. Accordingly, studies with more refined neuropharmacologic probes will be needed: 1) to examine the interactions among the preceding control systems in postmenopausal women, girls, and women studied at various stages of the menstrual cycle; and 2) to elucidate the importance of other, less well understood neurochemical pathways, such as those subserved by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), bombesin, neuropeptide Y, CRH catecholestrogens, etc., as well as putative metabolic signals associated with strenuous exercise, nutrient deprivation, and stress. The availability of increasingly specific neurotransmitter probes and more penetrating neuroendocrine analytic tools should aid in further significant progress in these arenas and, therefore, ultimately help to delineate additional specific pathophysiologic mechanisms that subserve reproductive dysfunction in women.\r"

Instability, patellar fracture, and wear of metal-backed patellar implants are significantly affected by errors of patellar resurfacing. A review of 50 TKAs using a condylar prosthesis and a standardized technique for patellar resurfacing was performed to evaluate the accuracy of the technique. The patients were evaluated at a mean of 2.5 years (range, two to five years) after surgery. The Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Score improved from a preoperative mean of 56 to 92 at the last evaluation. The Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Scores were excellent in 92% and good in 8%. The Knee Society Knee Score improved from a preoperative mean of 28 for pain and 49 for function to a last evaluation mean of 96 for pain and 85 for function. None of the patients had symptoms referable to the patellofemoral joint. There were no patellar fractures, dislocations, or instances of implant loosening of the patella. Roentgenograms revealed nine asymmetrically resurfaced patellae and five tilted patellae. There were no patellar subluxations. Patellar thickness was maintained at the preoperative level of 21 mm. Joint-line height was elevated 1 mm. The patellar height was decreased 2 mm from the preoperative height. Using a standard technique, satisfactory clinical results can be achieved, but minor errors in resurfacing and alignment will still occur.\r"

However, symptomatic knee replacements showed significantly greater uptake in the patella, femur, and medial and lateral tibial plateau regions (Mann-Whitney two-sample rank test). Bone scans in the symptomatic group were obtained at a mean of 44 months. Excluding those patients who had revision surgery, the differences remained significant. Furthermore, symptomatic knee replacements with normal roentgenograms also had significantly greater uptake. Radiolucent lines were noted in 30% of asymptomatic patients, whereas 29% of symptomatic knees had radiolucencies. Radiolucencies were not generally associated with significantly greater uptake. Lateral release had no effect on the patellar score.\r"

  ".W": "The results of 68 cemented total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) in 50 patients with gonarthrosis who were 55 years old or younger at the time of surgery were reviewed. These patients were operated on between 1979 and 1987 and were followed for an average of 6.2 years. The average age of the patients was 50 years. Patients were evaluated by the Hospital for Special Surgery knee score. The average preoperative score was 53, and the average follow-up score was 90. Overall, 55 TKAs were rated as excellent and 13 as good. Using the knee rating score advocated by the Knee Society, the average postoperative score was 92 for pain and 84 for function. There were four successful reoperations for patellar component loosening, all in metal-backed patellae. The femoral and tibial components in these patients were intact, and at the follow-up period, two knees were rated as excellent and two as good. Detailed roentgenographic evaluation demonstrated that 20% of tibial components had radiolucencies in at least one zone on the anteroposterior roentgenogram and in 11% on the lateral roentgenogram. Femoral radiolucencies occurred in only 2% of knees. Patellar radiolucencies in one or more zones occurred in 20% of knees that had not had patellar revision. No complete or progressive radiolucencies at the bone-cement interface were noted for any component, and no components were considered to be roentgenographically loose. Cemented TKAs can achieve excellent long-term results in patients younger than 55 years old with gonarthrosis of the knee. These results compare with those obtained in published reports on older age groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The overall infection rate was 7%, with an overall revision rate of 10% and an average follow-up period of 4.3 years. Wound complications were present in 12% of the TKAs. The rate of deep joint infections in diabetic patients was statistically higher than the reported incidence of sepsis in nondiabetic patients. Therefore, maximum precautions should be taken for diabetic patients having TKA to minimize both wound complications and joint sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "Bone loss in the distal anterior femur in asymptomatic total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients has been noted roentgenographically and during revision surgery. A retrospective roentgenographic review of 147 TKA cases was carried out to document bone loss. The influence that the mode of fixation (porous coated and cemented) and the implant design have on bone loss was examined. The time of onset and the progression of bone loss were studied. Bone loss occurred in the distal anterior femur in the majority of cases reviewed (68%). The prevalence of bone loss was independent of the mode of fixation and the implant design. By qualitative observation, roentgenographically detectable bone loss occurred within the first postoperative year and did not progress further. Previously three-dimensional finite element analysis demonstrated that the replacement of the bearing surface of the femur with a stiff metallic implant reduces the stress in the distal anterior femur by at least one order of magnitude. It is therefore speculated that the observed bone loss results from stress shielding. The apparent lack of progression may reflect the development of a new remodeling equilibrium under the altered stress conditions. The bone loss in the distal anterior femur described has not been implicated as a source of failure. However, since the bone strength in the femoral region is compromised as it becomes osteopenic, bone failure may occur with longer periods of cyclic loading. Furthermore, as a result of bone loss, revision arthroplasty may be more difficult.\r"

Clinically and roentgenographically, 12 of 14 grafts (86%) seemed to have united to the host bone. The average range of motion was 92 degrees. Five patients developed complications; two of these involved the allograft (nonunion and fracture) and two were caused by inadequate healing at the ligament-allograft junction. One patient had a late infection. With careful planning and improved surgical techniques, these complications can be avoided. The massive allograft-prosthesis composite techniques is a viable reconstructive alternative worthy of further clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "Although patellar tendon rupture after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a rare complication, the consistently poor outcome of conventional tendon repair has convinced some to abandon such reconstruction in favor of a prospective protocol using an allograft distal extensor mechanism. The graft consists of a quadriceps tendon, a patella with a cemented prosthesis, a patellar tendon, and a tibial tubercle. Since December 1985, 13 knees in 12 patients were reconstructed using this method. Ten knees were followed for six to 51 months; five of these knees were followed for more than 24 months. Knee extension power and improved function were ultimately attained in all cases, although minimal extensor lags were present in three cases. Preoperative motion returned in all but one knee. Healing of the allograft to the host tissue was attained primarily at all of the tibial junctions. Two graft complications occurred, both in the first three months after surgery: one quadriceps junction treated by resuture failed at the one-month mark, and the other graft had to be revised for extensor weakness from rupture of the graft at the patella-patellar tendon junction, which was attributed to surgical damage to the tendon. After completion of healing to the host and rehabilitation of the knee joint, no grafts in the series failed during the course of normal daily activities. One patient fractured the allograft patella in a severe fall. The long-term durability of this construct needs to be studied further.\r"

Individual components of the system included a bicruciate-retaining meniscal bearing, a posterior cruciate-retaining meniscal bearing, and a cruciate-sacrificing, rotating-platform tibial component mated to the same femoral and rotating patellar components. Survivorship analysis of each implant type was performed to identify specific failure modes and trends for long-term survival of the implants in a wide variety of primary knee arthroplasties. Clinically, there were 46 prostheses of the bicruciate type followed for up to 12 years, 57 prostheses of the posterior-cruciate type followed for up to six years, and 108 prostheses of the rotating-platform type followed for up to ten years. All knees in this study had rotating-bearing patellar prostheses. Cumulative survivorship analysis using an end point of implant revision or a poor knee score revealed a small early failure rate of each implant in the first three years, associated with technical positioning or undersizing errors. This study indicates a predictable long-term survival of both cruciate-retaining and cruciate-sacrificing mobile-bearing knee prostheses as well as rotating-bearing patellar prostheses when used in primary knee arthroplasties that minimized technical errors of insertion.\r"

In 14 patients and one specimen with normal roentgenograms and CT scans, the MRI demonstrated ten soft-tissue injuries as minimal displacement of the vertebral bodies or as a high signal intensity in the disc space, indicating a hematoma. Seven of the ten patients demonstrating soft-tissue injuries also had an intramedullary lesion, while in five of the 15 patients with normal CT scans, only a medullary lesion was present on MRI. In 11 patients and two postmortem specimens, fractures were seen on roentgenograms and CT scans. In these patients, the CT was superior to the MRI in detecting small bony fragments, but the medullary lesions were visible only on the MRIs. An intramedullary low signal intensity corresponded to macroscopically visible hemorrhages in the three postmortem specimens. The MRI provided important information in patients with neurologic deficits. No obvious pathologic changes were evident on the roentgenograms and CT scans. The MRI also demonstrated intramedullary and extramedullary soft-tissue lesions and was useful in establishing a diagnosis and in choosing appropriate therapy. CT, on the other hand, was superior in detecting small bony fragments and fracture lines.\r"

At final evaluation, no or slight pain was present in 77% of the shoulders: 39 of 50 without tendon tearing and 12 of 16 with tendon tearing and repair. Active shoulder abduction averaged 167 degrees. Ninety-two percent returned to employment, including 18% with some job modification. Eighty-six percent returned to recreational athletics, 20% with some modification of activities. Seven patients had additional surgical treatment.

All four patients who were managed conservatively died from complications of the fracture. Progressive deterioration was noted in each nonoperated patient, with confusion caused by narcotics and analgesics, pneumonia, hepatic coma, decubitus ulcers, severe depression, and severe hypoalbuminemia. Therefore, operative management was superior to conservative management for femoral neck fractures of patients receiving chronic dialysis with multiple medical problems and advanced renal osteodystrophy. Narcotics must be used with great caution, and efforts should be directed toward prevention of malnutrition and decubitus ulcers.\r"

The mean follow-up period was 45.1 months. Overall survival was 86%. There were local recurrences in 3% of patients, and 26 complications in 22 patients. Wound necrosis was the most frequent complication. Failure of allogeneic bone graft operations occurred in 25 patients. Most of the complications were salvageable without loss of limb. Limb salvage is an acceptable surgical treatment of extremity sarcomas based on adequate local control and minimal morbidity.\r"

It is a solitary, lytic, expanded lesion and infrequently may extend into the surrounding soft tissue. Histologically, it is composed of fibrous stroma with spindle-shaped fibroblasts, multinucleated giant cells, and inflammatory mononuclear cells. Areas of hemorrhage are uniformly present. It may be difficult to distinguish this entity from an aneurysmal bone cyst, giant-cell tumor, or brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism because of roentgenographic and histologic similarities. Accurate diagnosis is essential for appropriate treatment; serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels should be measured. Curettage and bone graft are effective treatments for both primary lesions and recurrences. Second recurrences are rare.\r"

  ".W": "Whereas xenogeneic collagen has provided a safe and effective biomaterial for numerous medical applications, there are few instances in which data permit the correlation of the immunologic profile of well-defined devices with their clinical sequelae. A major exception is the use of injectable bovine dermal collagen for soft-tissue contour correction. The low incidence of hypersensitivity has been studied in the context of clinical efficacy and safety with several devices. The findings indicate that such immunity usually results in the manifestation of local symptoms of dermal inflammation at sites of treatment that resolve as the implant is resorbed by the host. In contrast, more immunogenic hemostatic agents may elicit a more frequent or vigorous immune response that is not clinically visible or relevant in that application. Recent experiences with collagen-based devices for the repair and regeneration of bone have also demonstrated that the presence of immunity to their collagenous or non-collagenous components does not necessarily predict adverse clinical sequelae. Indeed, numerous specific data indicate that this immunity can exist as an epiphenomenon with no effect on osteogenesis. To get a true composite picture of biocompatibility, significant steps must be taken to characterize biomaterials properly and to ensure that immunologic, clinical, histologic, and other pertinent laboratory data are viewed in relation to one another and not in isolation.\r"

  ".W": "The kinetics and composition of the primary cellular inflammatory process were studied in the synovial fluid (SF) and synovial tissue (ST) compartments of a rabbit knee immobilization osteoarthritis model. Immobilization induced rapid migration of neutrophils (59% +/- 26% of all cells) into SF in three days, which was accompanied by nonspecific esterase-positive monocytes (71% +/- 8% of all mononuclear cells). This finding suggests that non-specific inflammation mediated by phagocytic leukocytes predominates the cellular response in the SF compartment. In contrast, morphometric analysis of ST proper showed an inflammatory mononuclear cell response, the intensity of which diminished over time during the study period from Day 3 (416 +/- 59 cells per 0.049 mm2 ST tissue) through Day 10 (305 +/- 32 cells) to Day 35 (174 +/- 36 cells). A dotlike T-pattern alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) was found in the T-cell-dependent areas of secondary lymphatic tissue in the spleen, enabling immunocytologic ANAE marker studies. The ST response in situ was predominated by tissue macrophage, though infiltrates rich in T lymphocytes were present in the immediate sublining stroma. There was a significant correlation between the intensity of the SF cell response (total recovery) and the percentage of neutrophils, but there was no correlation between the intensity of the ST response and the proportion of T lymphocytes. These T-cell accumulations together with the local proliferation of fibroblastlike lining cells and stromal fibroblasts suggest that the primary inflammatory cell response is not caused by either wear and tear or mechanically by cartilage fragments.\r"

Spastic preparations showed hind-limb spasticity and reflex incontinence one to two days after operation. Hypertrophic fibers began to appear in spastic muscles after two weeks. This hypertrophy, thought to be caused by phasic repetitive contraction, was verified by electron microscopy to be different from normal exercise hypertrophy. Flaccid preparations maintained hind-limb flaccidity and overflow incontinence. In flaccid muscle, marked muscle fiber necrosis indicated rapid atrophy. Spinal deformity and joint contracture inactivate spinalized rabbits, and cause pressure sores. However, feeding assistance and avoidance of complications make long-term maintenance possible.\r"

No significant increase in the ingrowth of bone into the porous coating occurred at the end of six weeks of electrical stimulation. The amount of bone that grew into the porous surface, the areal density of bone within the available pore space, and the extent of the prosthesis surface area with bone ingrowth or apposition were not significantly different in the control and stimulated groups. This particular form of electrical stimulation does not improve bone ingrowth into porous-surfaced canine THAs by six weeks.\r"

Forty-two of these patients received parenteral meperidine hydrochloride or morphine (Group 1), 58 patients received periodic epidural injections of morphine (Group 2), and 56 patients received continuous epidural infusions of bupivacaine hydrochloride and Duramorph (Group 3). The postoperative course of all patients was documented in terms of the incidence and severity of pain, range of joint motion, duration of hospitalization, and occurrence of complications. Although epidural analgesia increased the cost and duration of the operation, good-to-excellent pain relief was attained in 86% (Group 2) and 88% (Group 3) of cases with epidural analgesia compared with 61% of patients (Group 1) receiving conventional analgesia. Moreover, 67% of patients in Group 1 experienced frequent episodes of moderate-to-severe postoperative pain in contrast to 40% of patients in Group 2 and only 10% of patients in Group 3. As a result of diminished pain, greater joint motion was obtained within the first 72 hours in Groups 2 and 3. They also had shorter hospitalization (9.6 days versus 11.2 days for Group 1 and 10.8 days for Group 2). However, the use of epidural analgesia did not reduce the incidence of complications, including nausea. Continuous infusion of epidural bupivacaine and Duramorph provided good-to-excellent control of postoperative pain after TKA. However, better analgesics are needed to reduce the high incidence of side effects associated with various treatment methods.\r"

Microdamage produced before preparation can be separated from that caused by the preparation itself. Moreover, the technique does not cause additional artifactual cracking through dehydration. This technique provides a valid way to test hypotheses about the role that microdamage creation or its repair plays in skeletal pathology.\r"

The patella was displaced medially by an average of 4 mm and tilted medially by an average of 4 degrees after standard TKA. Medial translation or internal rotation of the femoral component further displaced and tilted the patella medially, but lateral translation or external rotation of the femoral component produced less predictable changes in patellar tracking. The patterns of patellar tracking after external rotation of the femoral component came closer to reproducing those of the intact knee than any other femoral component position. The high lateral ridge on the femoral component effectively prevents patellar dislocation but may produce abnormally high stresses on the patellar implant, especially if the implant is medially displaced or internally rotated. This could lead to accelerated wear or loosening of the patellar component.\r"

Previous metal-backed patellar designs have often failed, primarily because of implant design and implantation technique. In 451 total knee arthroplasties using metal-backed patellar prostheses, there were no implant failures. The implants were dome shaped and did not have a metal endoskeleton. The component was inset into the patellar bone so that the base plate was below the superficial surface of the bone. These factors maximized polyethylene thickness and prevented wearing through to the metal base plate. The advantage of metal backing is that it strengthens the component and allows for possible biologic ingrowth. In this series, the combination of implant design and implantation technique may have eliminated serious problems seen with other metal-backed patellar implants.\r"

A posterior cruciate condylar prosthesis was used in each procedure. Patients were followed clinically and roentgenographically, and a set of statistical variables was established based on elevation in joint line, tibial component angular alignment, overall limb alignment, and position of the tibial component on anteroposterior and lateral roentgenograms. Review of the study group found that the Hospital for Special Surgery knee scores improved from a preoperative score of 55 to a postoperative score of 88, with 94.5% having good or excellent results. The mean postoperative range of motion was 106 degrees with a mean extension of -0.3 degrees. Radiolucencies developed in 41% of the knees with 5% of the knees having progressive radiolucencies. Eight knees were considered failures based on clinical and roentgenographic evaluations. Factors found to significantly affect the formation of radiolucent lines included a shift of the tibial component medially by greater than 4 mm, a varus tilt of the tibial component greater than 2 degrees, and the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. The only variable associated with aseptic loosening was an elevation of the joint line by greater than 8 mm.\r"

The radii of these surfaces, their angular arcs, and the distances between their centers varied with the size of the femur but fell within a narrow range. The radii of the patellar groove and the posterior femoral condyles averaged 24 mm and 21 mm, and the average angle subtended by these arcs was 90 degrees and 140 degrees, respectively. The average distance between the centers of these two circles was 20 mm. The femoral attachment of the synovial and patellar retinacular reflections was found in the area of the center of the patellar groove circle. The femoral attachments of the medial collateral and posterior cruciate ligaments and of the lateral collateral and anterior cruciate ligaments were found to be in the area of the center of the circle of the medial and lateral posterior femoral condylar circles, respectively.\r"

It is important to remember that there can be wide variability in the structural findings noted in the fetus with ventricular dilatation or abnormal cerebellar development. If an abnormality of the fetal head and spine is seen, it is important to carefully assess other areas of fetal anatomy because of the increased likelihood of coexisting anomalies. Because of the increased incidence of chromosomal abnormalities, evaluation by percutaneous umbilical blood sampling, amniocentesis or placental biopsy is recommended for all structural abnormalities of the fetal head and spine. The best clinical approach for the ultrasonologist is to accurately describe and quantify the abnormalities for geneticist, pediatrician and or neurosurgeon to discuss the prognosis. Accurate evaluation of the type, location and extent of a neural tube defect is important to enable the family to understand possible outcomes of the pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "When cystic hygroma is detected antenatally, the prognosis is usually poor, and intrauterine or neonatal death are common. This seems especially true for Turner syndrome (the largest etiologic group associated with cystic hygroma) and the lethal multiple pterygium syndromes. However, some fetuses with Turner syndrome, and also with certain other diagnoses, had a good outcome, and further study of these conditions is required before more definite prognostic indicators and risk figures will be available. Increasing numbers of syndromes are being reported in association with fetal cystic hygroma, and lymphedema may be a common element in their pathogenesis. Mild, short-lived, or otherwise uncomplicated jugular lymphatic obstruction may be a cause of the neck webbing seen in the Noonan, familial pterygium colli, and distichiasis-lymphedema syndromes. With earlier and more widespread fetal ultrasonography, and more sensitive techniques, a greater number of resolving fetal cases may be reported. This may clarify the natural history and provide prospective criteria for the conditions that have better prognoses. The associated conditions include autosomal dominant and recessive genetic traits. Careful ultrasound study for other malformations, polyhydramnios and fetal growth parameters, a fetal karyotype, and, if appropriate, pathologic examination are required to determine the etiology and recurrence risk. The parents should be asked about exposure to alcohol or other agents and should be examined for signs of pterygium colli or Noonan syndrome. If the decision is made to continue the pregnancy, and there is doubt about the natural history and prognosis, multi-disciplinary supervision should include social services, neonatology, pediatric surgery, cardiology, and genetics specialties when indicated.\r"

Approximately 25% to 30% of a randomly selected population sample is homozygous for the traits of low catechol-O-methyltransferase activity and thermolabile enzyme in the red blood cell. We tested the hypothesis that the catechol-O-methyltransferase genetic polymorphism might also control those same characteristics of the enzyme in an important human drug-metabolizing organ, the liver. Catechol-O-methyltransferase enzyme activity and thermal stability were measured in 99 hepatic biopsy samples obtained during clinically indicated surgery. The frequency distribution of heated/control ratios, a measure of enzyme thermal stability, was bimodal, with 28% of samples included in a subgroup with thermolabile enzyme. There were no sex-related differences in hepatic catechol-O-methyltransferase thermal stability. However, catechol-O-methyltransferase enzyme activity in hepatic tissue from male subjects was significantly higher than that in samples from female subjects: 61.3 +/- 20.2 units/mg protein (mean +/- SD; n = 50) versus 46.6 +/- 22.2 units/mg protein (n = 49; p = 0.0002). There was a significant correlation of hepatic catechol-O-methyltransferase activity and thermal stability in samples from both female (rs = 0.698; p = 0.0001) and male subjects (rs = 0.429; p = 0.002). Finally, when both red blood cell catechol-O-methyltransferase activity and thermal stability were measured in blood samples from 34 of these patients, there was a significant correlation between catechol-O-methyltransferase heated/control ratios and levels of enzyme activity in hepatic tissue and in red blood cell lysates. These findings indicate that the genetic polymorphism that controls catechol-O-methyltransferase activity level and thermal stability in red blood cells also controls those same properties of the enzyme in the human liver.\r"

After the development of a data base of pharmacokinetic parameters, we examined glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics in 54 patients between 2 and 70 years of age using 70 pharmacokinetic studies after administration of intravenous methylprednisolone (n = 25), oral methylprednisolone (n = 15), intravenous prednisolone (n = 18), and oral prednisone (n = 12). Eleven patients had unusually rapid methylprednisolone elimination (clearance, 565 to 837 ml/min/1.73 m2; population mean, [+/- SD] 380 +/- 100 ml/min/1.73 m2) without an identifiable cause. Incomplete absorption of methylprednisolone and prednisone was observed in three patients and one patient, respectively. Evaluation of glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics in children aged 1 year 8 months to 18 years demonstrated a significant inverse correlation (r = 0.88; p less than 0.001) between prednisolone clearance and age. It is therefore important to consider age in the interpretation of pharmacokinetic data. To simplify measurement of prednisolone clearance, a single-dose single-point method was developed. This was based on a highly significant relationship between the 6-hour postdose prednisolone concentration and prednisolone clearance (log prednisolone clearance = 2.66 + [6-hour postdose concentration] [-0.00167]; r2 = 0.96; p less than 0.0001). Evaluation of glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics in the clinical setting can be used to identify abnormalities in absorption, elimination, and patient compliance. This technique can be used to individualize glucocorticoid dosing regimens.\r"

Lower adenosine infusion rates (5 micrograms/100 ml forearm/min, three times) induced forearm blood flow increments to 330% +/- 94%, 339% +/- 67% and 330% +/- 79%, respectively (n = 8). These forearm blood flow responses were reduced (p = 0.02) during concomitant intra-arterial infusion of two doses of caffeine (30 and 90 micrograms/100 ml forearm/min) to 150% +/- 45% and 98% +/- 28%, respectively. Theophylline (30 micrograms/100 ml forearm/min; n = 6) also significantly attenuated the adenosine-induced increase in forearm blood flow. Enprofylline (30 micrograms/100 ml forearm/min), a related xanthine with a low affinity to adenosine receptors in vitro, did not change the response to adenosine. Nonspecific vasodilation by sodium nitroprusside infusion (50 ng/100 ml forearm/min) was not inhibited by caffeine compared with placebo (forearm blood flow responses were 202% +/- 21% versus 216% +/- 40%; n = 6). This study demonstrated that caffeine and theophylline specifically reduce adenosine-induced vasodilation in humans, supporting the existence of functional human vascular adenosine receptors.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that vascular prostacyclin synthesis is stimulated by hydrochlorothiazide and could account for some of the drug's antihypertensive effect. We studied 13 patients with mild essential hypertension in a randomized, double-blind design to assess the effects of indomethacin on hydrochlorothiazide's ability to lower blood pressure, alter body weight, stimulate plasma renin activity, and modulate vascular prostacyclin biosynthesis as assessed by the urinary excretion of the major enzymatically produced metabolite of prostacyclin, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha), measured by GC/MS. Administration of hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg daily for 2 weeks, was associated with a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both supine (systolic, 148 +/- 3 to 136 +/- 3 mm Hg; diastolic, 97 +/- 2 to 94 +/- 3 mm Hg) and upright (systolic, 151 +/- 4 to 131 +/- 2 mm Hg; diastolic, 103 +/- 2 to 97 +/- 3 mm Hg) positions. Hydrochlorothiazide administration resulted in a 1 kg weight loss and stimulation of plasma renin activity from 1.7 +/- 0.4 to 5.3 +/- 1.1 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr. However, the urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha was unchanged after administration of hydrochlorothiazide (86 +/- 13/ng/gm creatinine during placebo, 74 +/- 13 ng/gm during week 1 of hydrochlorothiazide, and 70 +/- 9 ng/gm during week 2 of the drug). Administration of indomethacin, 50 mg twice a day, resulted in greater than 60% inhibition of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion but did not affect the antihypertensive response to hydrochlorothiazide. Indomethacin did not oppose the diuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide as assessed by weight loss but did attenuate the rise in plasma renin activity. Our data demonstrate that the blood pressure-lowering effect of a thiazide diuretic does not require enhanced prostacyclin synthesis and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin does not antagonize the antihypertensive efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide.\r"

Peak aortic blood flow acceleration (ACL), measured by Doppler ultrasonography, was used to evaluate left ventricular systolic function. Repeated exercise testing was performed on two separate days after long-term oral administration of 40 mg propranolol or placebo every 6 hours in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. Pharmacodynamic relationships were determined by fitting percent change in ACL and heart rate at maximal exertion with 1-propranolol with the Emax model (maximal effect) and nonlinear regression. Reductions in systolic function and heart rate during exercise were related directly to 1-propranolol. Propranolol was significantly (p less than 0.05) more potent in reducing heart rate (EC50, 10.6 +/- 9.2 ng/ml) compared with ACL (EC50, 19.2 +/- 8.9 ng/ml). However, Emax of propranolol for reducing ACL was significantly greater than that for reducing heart rate (-46.7% +/- 6.9% versus -29.5% +/- 15.9%; p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the concentration-effect relationship for 1-propranolol and its negative inotropic effect differ from its negative chronotropic effect.\r"

After several months nausea and weight loss gradually developed in the patient that could be controlled initially by dose reduction, leading to levels inappropriate for aluminum chelation. HPLC analysis of blood and urine revealed several metabolites including, as a major component, a plasma monoamine oxidase (MAO) catalyzed end product MFO1. Coadministration of isoniazid, a plasma MAO inhibitor, with deferoxamine resulted in reduction of MFO1 from 81% to 8% accompanied by increases in the amounts of metabolite 2 (MFO2) from 2% to 24% and unmetabolized deferoxamine from 17% to 68% after 6 months of treatment. The side effects subsided, the patient regained weight, and treatment could be continued.\r"

Atenolol (50 to 100 mg once a day) and enalapril (2.5 to 40 mg once a day), combined with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once a day), had similar levels of efficacy and safety. A comprehensive battery of psychologic assessments for quality of life was administered, including measures of anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, memory, and psychomotor function. These five conceptually based clusters were first analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance procedures, followed by univariate analyses of the individual variables composing each domain. In general, neither atenolol nor enalapril was associated with major changes in psychologic functioning. The only data cluster with a statistically significant change was memory function, primarily as a result of lower scores of the digit span (backward) test, for atenolol relative to enalapril. These preliminary findings suggest that atenolol and enalapril have comparable degrees of efficacy and safety, with no major disparities in quality-of-life effects, for hypertensive patients with a history of taking diuretics and this sort of quality-of-life assessment can be performed during trials of antihypertensive drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoporosis is a serious side effect of systemic treatment with steroids. Cloprednol, a synthetic glucocorticoid with an anti-inflammatory potency twice that of prednisone, causes less calcium and nitrogen excretion than does prednisone in equipotent doses. Therefore a double-blind study was undertaken comparing the effects of alternate-day cloprednol and prednisone therapy on bone mineral density in 39 patients (cloprendol: 13 men and 8 women aged 48.5 +/- 2.8 years; prednisone: 9 men and 9 women aged 49.7 +/- 1.7 years) with lung diseases. Ten patients with asthma (9 men and 1 woman aged 37.8 +/- 3.7 years) inhaling daily beclomethasone served as control subjects. Trabecular and total bone density of the distal tibia and radius was determined quarterly during 1 year with a special-purpose computed tomographic system. Initial mean trabecular bone density of the patients receiving cloprednol and prednisone was 17% below normal. After a treatment period of 1 year, we found a loss of radial trabecular bone density (mean +/- SEM) of 1.33% +/- 0.49% in the cloprednol group and 2.38% +/- 0.69% in the prednisone group. In postmenopausal women, prednisone but not cloprednol therapy caused significant (p less than 0.01) trabecular bone loss (5.29% +/- 0.99% versus 0.70% +/- 0.65%). The control group lost 0.91% +/- 0.79%. Loss of cortical bone was insignificant in all three groups. In post-menopausal women, 1 year of alternate-day cloprednol therapy was associated with significantly less bone loss than was prednisone therapy in equipotent dosages.\r"

Lovastatin did not alter chlorpropamide kinetics or glycemic profiles. No patient had an elevation in serum transaminases or creatinine phosphokinase, and no patient had any other laboratory or clinical drug-related adverse experience during the study. Lovastatin was as effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with NIDDM as in nondiabetic subjects. Diabetic control was unaltered, and no evidence of alteration in lovastatin or chlorpropamide blood levels was noted.\r"

Eight volunteers were extensive metabolizers of S-mephenytoin, and eight were poor metabolizers of S-mephenytoin. Plasma levels of diazepam and its demethyl metabolite were determined by HPLC in blood samples drawn during 4 weeks. There was no difference in diazepam disposition between the two phenotypes. However, the plasma half-life of demethyldiazepam was longer in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers of mephenytoin (mean +/- SD: 161 +/- 37 and 116 +/- 29 hours, respectively; p less than 0.02). The plasma concentrations of demethyldiazepam at 7, 14, and 21 days after intake of diazepam were significantly higher in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers. We compared the pharmacokinetic parameters of diazepam in Chinese subjects with our previously reported data from white subjects. The mean plasma half-life values of diazepam in Chinese extensive metabolizers (85.1 hours) and poor metabolizers (88.3 hours) were very similar to those in white subjects who were poor metabolizers (88.3 hours), and more than twice those in white subjects who were extensive metabolizers (40.8 hours). In parallel, the mean clearance of diazepam in Chinese subjects (independent of phenotype) was similar to that in white subjects who were poor metabolizers, but half that in white subjects who were extensive metabolizers. Chinese subjects had a slightly larger volume of distribution of diazepam than white subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Continuous-infusion inulin clearance (CLIN), 4-hour creatinine clearance (CLCR,m), and 24-hour creatinine clearance (CLCR,a) were measured in 109 subjects (86 men and 23 women) with varying degrees of stable renal function (CLIN, 6 to 209 ml/min) and compared with CLCR values as predicted by five equations on the basis of plasma creatinine concentrations, age, weight, and/or height. The CLCR,m was positively correlated with CLIN (r = 0.92; p less than 0.0001) but exceeded CLIN by 15% between the range of 30 and 209 ml/min (CLIN). Similarly, CLCR,a correlated well with both CLCR,m (r = 0.84; p less than 0.0005) and CLIN (r = 0.84; p less than 0.0001). The relative role of tubular secretion in the overall clearance of creatinine increased with declining CLIN and exceeded 40% when CLIN was below 30 ml/min. CLCR estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault and Mawer methods did not significantly differ from either CLCR,m or CLCR,m, whereas the other equations generally underestimated CLCR. Among the numerous mathematical equations, CLCR as estimated by the method proposed either by Mawer or Cockcroft and Gault was the best predictor of CLIN (CLIN = 1.05CLRCR - 18.38 or CLIN = 1.12CLCR - 20.60, respectively; r = 0.81; p less than 0.0001). The present data support the use of estimator equations proposed by Cockcroft and Gault or Mawer for rapid estimation of renal function in the clinical setting.\r"

Pharmacologic response was assessed by use of standardized treadmill tests during 24 hours after administration of oral labetalol. Oral clearance of labetalol decreased with cimetidine administration (58.7 +/- 23.3 to 32.9 +/- 13.2 ml/min/kg; p less than 0.05), thereby causing a 79% increase in area under the curve. Labetalol systemic clearance also decreased (23.2 +/- 5.3 to 17.7 +/- 3.7 ml/min/kg; p less than 0.05), but the volume of distribution was unchanged. Labetalol caused significant beta-blockade for 8 hours after the last oral dose, but cimetidine did not alter pharmacologic response. The Emax model provided a good description of the concentration-effect relationship. At peak labetalol concentrations after oral administration, (R,R)-labetalol concentrations were significantly lower than those of the other three stereoisomers (p less than 0.05). Cimetidine caused an increase in the concentrations of each stereoisomer, but the difference was significant (p less than 0.05) for only the (S,R)-, (S,S)-, and (R,S)-isomers. This first evidence of labetalol stereoselective disposition is consistent with the findings of previous (R,R)-labetalol pharmacokinetic studies and with previous pharmacodynamic investigations of labetalol and (R,R)-labetalol.\r"

We also investigated the usefulness of noninvasive sampling techniques to obtain parameter estimates for drug disposition in these developmentally disabled individuals. After administration of 5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg oral doses of acetaminophen, subjects with Down's syndrome resembled control subjects in most pharmacokinetic and metabolic parameters, including apparent half-life, volume of distribution per kilogram body mass, total body clearance per kilogram of body mass, extrapolated saliva concentration at time zero, and the urinary excretion of acetaminophen glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Glutathione conjugation tended to increase and sulfate conjugation tended to decrease in all subjects as the acetaminophen dose increased from 5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. Results based on these samples of very limited size also suggest that acetaminophen metabolism to glutathione-derived conjugates may have been increased in subjects with Down's syndrome. The similarity of estimates of acetaminophen pharmacokinetics and data on metabolic fate between subjects with Down's syndrome and normal volunteers indicates that large effects of trisomy 21 on these processes are unlikely. Also, these results were in agreement with extensive data obtained with invasive techniques, indicating that simple noninvasive methodologies appear to be well suited for studying acetaminophen disposition in populations of developmentally disabled individuals.\r"

The ovulation time was characterized by luteinizing hormone levels, body basal temperatures, and progesterone and estradiol serum levels. D-Xylose was assayed in plasma and urine with a phloroglucinol-based colorimetric method. The findings of this study indicated that menstrual cycle did not significantly affect D-xylose absorption. After oral administration, the total clearance was significantly increased in cycle 2 during the luteal phase (p = 0.004). After intravenous administration in both cycles, D-xylose total clearance was also significantly faster during the luteal phase (p = 0.038 and p = 0.041, respectively). After oral administration, the renal clearance tended to be higher during the luteal phase in both cycles studied. After intravenous administration, this parameter was increased during the luteal phase by 24% and 25% in cycle 1 and by 8% and 12% in cycle 2. These findings are consistent with those of others showing an increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The findings of this study seem to be explained by the hormonal changes occurring during the menstrual cycle. Further investigations are warranted with use of specific probes of renal processes (GFR, renal reabsorption and tubular secretion) to confirm our findings and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.\r"

Guanadrel reduced sympathetic tone (i.e., plasma norepinephrine and norepinephrine release rate), whereas venous responses to phenylephrine and clonidine were both augmented during guanadrel treatment. The effect on phenylephrine responses was primarily attributable to a decrease in the median effective concentration with a small increase in maximum response. Clonidine showed a markedly increased maximum response with a small increase in the median effective concentration. Platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors increased slightly but there was no change in the amount of platelet pertussis toxin substrate during guanadrel treatment. Thus reduction in sympathetic tone in normal young men results in increased venous responses to both alpha 1- and alpha 2-agonists.\r"

This electroencephalographic parameter could then be used to relate midazolam plasma concentrations and electroencephalographic drug effect (pharmacodynamic modeling). Intravenous doses of midazolam (3.75 to 25 mg) were given to five men at an infusion rate of 5 mg/min. A cortical electroencephalogram was continuously recorded. Two waveform analysis approaches were examined: fast Fourier transformation and aperiodic analysis. From fast Fourier transformation and aperiodic analysis a set of parameters were examined as measures of drug effect. We conclude that the voltage per second from aperiodic analysis provided the electroencephalographic parameter that optimally measured the effect of midazolam on the central nervous system.\r"

Arterial plasma concentration and electroencephalogram voltage were related with nonparameteric and parametric pharmacodynamic models. The peak increases in voltage (maximal effect) and the slopes of the plasma concentration versus effect curve were similar for both drugs. The half-time of blood:brain equilibration was significantly longer for midazolam than diazepam (4.8 minutes versus 1.6 minutes). Midazolam was found to have an intrinsic steady-state potency that was approximately five times greater than that of diazepam (152 ng/ml versus 958 ng/ml).\r"

Subjects received oral doses of either 250 mg caffeine (n = 6) or placebo (n = 4), and hemodynamic changes were studied at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after drug administration. Thirty minutes after the caffeine dose, blood pressure had risen from 127 +/- 8/57 +/- 4 mm Hg to 136 +/- 3/68 +/- 5 mm Hg, heart rate was unchanged, and the baroreflex slope had decreased from 31 +/- 7 msec/mm Hg to 11.6 +/- 2 msec/mm Hg. Baroreflex sensitivity remained inhibited for the rest of the single-dose experimental period. In contrast, no significant changes were observed after either long-term caffeine ingestion in the same group or in the placebo group during the single- or multiple-dose study. These findings indicate that single but not multiple caffeine administration inhibits baroreflex activation in normotensive volunteers and this could contribute to the acute hemodynamic effects of caffeine.\r"

The kidney contains high activities of gamma-glutamyltransferase in the brush border membrane of the proximal tubule, from which it is released into urine. This study investigated the effect of phenobarbital and antipyrine, two inducers of hepatic monoxygenases and gamma-glutamyltransferase, on the urinary excretion of renal gamma-glutamyltransferase. Three groups (n = 6) of healthy male volunteers received 100 mg phenobarbital for 7 and 14 days and 1200 mg antipyrine for 7 days, respectively. Antipyrine and phenobarbital increased antipyrine elimination, serum gamma-glutamyltransferase, and the urinary excretion of renal gamma-glutamyltransferase, whereas urinary beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-glucuronidase, and total protein and glucose excretion were unchanged. No correlation was found between serum and urinary gamma-glutamyltransferase or both enzymes and antipyrine elimination. Increases in antipyrine elimination were positively correlated to increases in serum, but not urinary gamma-glutamyltransferase. The findings suggest that antipyrine and phenobarbital increase urinary gamma-glutamyltransferase excretion. However, the increase in urinary gamma-glutamyltransferase does not reflect the magnitude of hepatic enzyme induction.\r"

Patients received indecainide, 50 mg by mouth, every 6 hours and the dose was increased until greater than or equal to 80% suppression was noted, adverse effects occurred, or a maximum dose of 100 mg indecainide was given every 6 hours. Ventricular premature complexes were suppressed greater than or equal to 80% in nine patients (p less than 0.05) and ventricular tachycardia episodes were completely suppressed in five of eight patients. The effective or maximal mean daily indecainide dose was 191 +/- 32 mg; half of the responders achieved achieved efficacy at serum drug concentration greater than or equal to 600 ng/ml. Serum drug concentration was directly related to gender (r = 0.78, p less than 0.04) and inversely related to creatinine clearance (r = 0.74, p less than 0.05) and ejection fraction (r = 0.71, p less than 0.02). Indecainide prolonged mean PR and QRS intervals (p less than 0.05) but not QT or QTc. There was a linear relation between percent change in PR (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001) and QRS (r = 0.66, p less than 0.001) intervals and serum drug concentration. After starting or increasing the dose, careful observation of patients with decreased renal function or reduced ejection fraction should be exercised because they attain higher drug concentration than normal subjects.\r"

A higher glomerular filtration rate and a higher serum concentration of urea were seen in 50-day-old essential fatty acid-deficient rats compared with age-matched controls. Later, the glomerular filtration rate progressively deteriorated in parallel with a decline in effective renal plasma flow and with a concomittant rise in serum levels of urea and creatinine. The serum concentration of protein was lower in the rats with essential fatty acid deficiency and that of sodium was higher than in the control rats. The non-renal clearance of tobramycin was increased in the rats with essential fatty acid deficiency. 3. The early hyperfiltration in essential fatty acid-deficient rats with the subsequent fall in glomerular filtration rate, which was paralleled by a rise in serum levels of urea and creatinine, as well as the increased non-renal clearance of tobramycin, are in accordance with the clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis. Rats with essential fatty acid deficiency might be a useful model with which to study the pathophysiological renal changes in cystic fibrosis related to the progressive essential fatty acid deficiency in this disease.\r"

To determine the effects of facial cooling on intraoral thermal events, we placed a thermal conductivity sensor on the buccal surface of the left cheek in six normal and six asthmatic subjects. Room temperature and cold stimuli were then applied to the integument surface of both sides of the face while mucosal surface temperature and thermal conductivity, as an index of blood flow, were recorded. 2. The room temperature challenge had no effect. Application of the cold stimulus to the exterior of the left cheek caused a monotonic decrease in temperature in the mouth in all subjects and was associated with a change in thermal conductivity in which blood flow increased and then fell to baseline despite a continued drop in temperature. These responses were purely local in that cooling of the right side of the face did not change the temperature or blood flow on the left side. No differences were noted between the asthmatic and normal subjects. 3. The data indicate that lowering the temperature of the skin of the face produces significant alterations in the thermal environment within the mouth. With facial cooling, buccal temperature falls and mucosal blood supply transiently rises. This effect appears to be a purely local thermally mediated event. Facial pressure and cutaneous reflexes do not play a role. The above changes may contribute to the conditioning of inspired air during oral breathing.\r"

Plasma and samples from the quadriceps femoris muscle (percutaneous muscle biopsy) for amino acid determination were collection before and at 1, 3, 5 and 7 h after the meal. 2. After the protein-free meal the concentrations of most essential amino acids and of some non-essential amino acids in plasma decreased continuously below basal levels at 5-7 h. The muscle concentration of essential amino acids fell too, reaching its nadir 3-5 h after the meal. The decrease in plasma amino acid concentration was smaller than the decrease in muscle concentration for all essential amino acids except phenylalanine. 3. The concentrations of most amino acids in plasma increased transiently 1 and 3 h after the protein-rich meal; histidine and several non-essential amino acids fell below the basal levels at 5-7 h after the meal.

Substrate movements in forearm muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue were studied, by measurement of arteriovenous differences and blood flow, in seven normal subjects after an overnight fast and then for 6 h after ingestion of a mixed meal. Overall substrate balances were examined in terms of the flux of gram-atoms of carbon. 2. As found previously, the forearm was approximately in carbon balance (import equal to export) after the overnight fast, whereas adipose tissue was a net exporter of carbon, mainly in the form of non-esterified fatty acids. 3. After the meal, arterialized plasma concentrations of glucose and lactate rose sharply (peak at 60 min), whereas those of non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol fell (nadir at 60-120 min). Plasma triacylglycerol concentrations rose slowly to peak at 240 min;much of this rise was accounted for by a rise in the chylomicron fraction. 4. Both tissues took up glucose at an increased rate after the meal. Release of non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol from adipose tissue was suppressed. Clearance of triacylglycerol by both tissues increased after the meal, but was more marked in adipose tissue, where the fractional extraction of chylomicron-triacylglycerol reached 44% at 240 min. 5. The forearm rapidly became a considerable net importer of carbon, and remained so until 6 h after the meal when it was again in approximate carbon balance. Glucose uptake dominated the forearm carbon balance. Adipose tissue was a net importer of carbon from 30 min until 5 h after the meal and then reverted to net export. Clearance of triacylglycerol carbon made the largest contribution to this positive balance, but towards the end of the study this was increasingly counterbalanced by simultaneous non-esterified fatty acid release.\r"

Chyme fatty acid concentrations were measured during a 4 h incubation (a) without an inhibitor, (b) after acid treatment, (c) after addition of p-bromophenylboronic acid and (d) after heating. 3. In a separate experiment, fresh chyme was incubated to allow equilibration of lipolysis. Aliquots were treated by each inactivation method and ultracentrifuged overnight to separate the phases. Total and micellar fatty acids and glycerides were measured. 4. In the first experiment, acid treatment completely inhibited fatty acid generation producing 4 h concentrations which were 93.4 +/- 5.6% (mean +/- SEM) of initial values compared with 398.0 +/- 54.0% (P less than 0.05) for uninhibited samples. p-Bromophenylboronic acid and heating gave significant but incomplete inhibition (132.9 +/- 6.6% and 166.1 +/- 15.2% of initial concentrations, respectively). 5. Ultracentrifugation disclosed five phases in all except the acid-treated samples, which had four. Micellar phase fatty acid concentrations were significantly higher in the acid-treated than in the untreated samples (2.6 +/- 0.7 versus 1.7 +/- 0.5 mmol/l, P = 0.05), as were glyceride concentrations (1.5 +/- 0.4 vs 0.6 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, P = 0.05). 6. It was concluded that acid treatment was the most efficient inhibitor of fatty acid production, but it disrupted the phases. p-Bromophenylboronic acid gave significant inhibition without causing phase disruption and was therefore the most useful inhibitor overall.\r"

Ammonium chloride washout induced a profound intracellular acidosis, stimulating Na+/H+ exchange. This led to a 236% increase in Na+ influx. Eighty-eight per cent of this increase was inhibited by 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride. This demonstrates that 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride is an effective inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange in human leucocytes. 4. The recovery from intracellular acidosis was shown to be dependent entirely on the presence of extracellular Na+. The Ki for inhibition by 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride of the recovery was 0.5 mumol/l. 5. Incubation with serum increased Na+ influx and Na+ content: the maximal effect was reached at 20% dilution. Serum (10%, v/v) increased influx by 40%, and 20% (v/v) serum by 102%, over resting levels. Only 43% of the serum-induced increase in Na+ influx was inhibited by 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride. This represented one-fifth of total Na+ influx. 6. Leucocyte intracellular pH increased on incubation with serum. This alkalinization was inhibited using 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride. 7.

In a control series, the renal perfusate flow was stable but the glomerular filtration rate, as measured by [14C]inulin clearance, declined with time. A stable glomerular filtration rate could be obtained by increasing the basal perfusate amino acid concentration to 14 mmol/l. 3. The addition of 6 mmol/l mixed amino acids produced a sustained increase in renal perfusate flow and an increase in [14C]inulin clearance, reversing its time-dependent fall. Sodium reabsorption was enhanced, but, unlike the control series, no increase in fractional albumin excretion was obtained. 4. Renal perfusate flow was increased by glycine (6 mmol/l), L-arginine hydrochloride (6 mmol/l) and sodium glutamate (6 mmol/l) but remained unaffected by L-leucine. The vasodilatation induced by L-arginine hydrochloride and sodium glutamate was not sustained. 5. The time-dependent fall in [14C]inulin clearance was prevented by glycine, L-arginine and glutamic acid, but not by L-leucine. L-Arginine hydrochloride, like the mixed amino acid solution, produced a significant increase in [14C]inulin clearance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Incubation in vitro with increasing amiodarone concentrations led to a progressive stomatocytic shape transformation and a decreased deformability of the erythrocytes. 3. Amiodarone treatment in eight patients did not affect erythrocyte morphology and deformability. However, an increase in the membrane cholesterol/phospholipid ratio was found. 4. The stomatocytic shape transformation of erythrocytes in vitro indicates that amiodarone intercalates in the inner hemileaflet of the lipid bilayer leading to membrane internalization.

The regional haemodynamic effects of intravenous bolus doses of captopril, enalaprilat and lisinopril were assessed in conscious Brattleboro (i.e. vasopressin-deficient) rats, chronically instrumented with miniaturized pulsed Doppler probes and intravascular catheters. 2. Responses to incremental doses of each drug (spanning the median effective dose for the inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I) were examined in both water-replete and water-deprived states. 3. In the water-replete state, the haemodynamic profiles of captopril, enalaprilat and lisinopril were generally similar, with incremental doses causing rises in mesenteric and renal flow and, to a lesser extent, hindquarters flow. There were small tachycardias and only slight falls in mean blood pressure. 4. In the water-deprived state, the effects of all three drugs were greatly enhanced; tachycardic and hypotensive effects occurred together with increases in mesenteric, renal and hindquarters flows. However, for renal flow and renal vascular conductance the effectiveness of the drugs decreased in the order enalaprilat greater than captopril greater than lisinopril, whereas for mesenteric flow and mesenteric vascular conductance the order was captopril greater than enalaprilat greater than lisinopril. 5. Since marked haemodynamic actions were seen with doses one-tenth of the median effective dose for the inhibition of the pressor effect of angiotensin I, it is likely these effects were due to inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme, although not necessarily to inhibition of angiotensin II production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results are presented of a cross-sectional study of 25 non-pregnant and 125 pregnant/postnatal women in whom platelet angiotensin II binding and plasma angiotensin II, plasma renin concentration and plasma renin substrate were measured. 2. Platelet angiotensin II binding was significantly lower in the first-trimester patients as compared with the non-pregnant women (P less than 0.001). Specific binding remained low in the second and third trimesters, and in those patients studied 24 h after delivery. However, higher values, approximating to the non-pregnant level, were found 6 weeks postnatally (n = 25 for each group). 3. Plasma angiotensin II, plasma renin concentration and plasma renin substrate increased in pregnancy, with the increase becoming statistically significant as compared with the non-pregnant women in the second trimester. Maximal median values of plasma angiotensin II and plasma renin substrate were found in the third trimester, but maximal median values of plasma renin concentration were found in the second trimester. The concentrations of all three hormones fell after delivery. 4. There was an inverse correlation between platelet angiotensin II binding and simultaneously measured endogenous levels of plasma angiotensin II (P less than 0.02) and plasma renin substrate (P less than 0.05) in the 25 non-pregnant subjects. These findings support the concept of the angiotensin II receptor concentration being regulated by the plasma angiotensin II level. There was no correlation between platelet angiotensin II binding and plasma renin concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) concentrations in plasma of humans and pigs with pseudo-vitamin D deficiency rickets type I (PVDRI) have been reported to be significantly lower than in normal subjects and animals. Sometimes, however, calcitriol concentrations are relatively high in these subjects and animals (50-80 pmol/l) and nevertheless clinical symptoms of rickets develop. We have studied whether or not the development of rachitic lesions in piglets with PVDRI is due to altered binding properties of the intestinal calcitriol receptor in addition to the defective renal production of calcitriol. PVDRI piglets with clinical and biochemical symptoms of rickets (hypocalcaemia, increased activity of alkaline phosphatase) and with calcitriol concentrations in plasma of 83.7 +/- 4.2 pmol/l (n = 7) were used. They were compared with unaffected piglets with normal calcitriol concentrations (178.0 +/- 17.7 pmol/l, n = 9). 2.

In all, irrespective of distribution of coronary artery disease or use of pharmacologic support, a transient depression of RV systolic function with respect to both preinduction and initial postoperative (Postop) values occurred 262 +/- 116 min post-CPB as represented by a decrease in RV stroke volume index (25.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 33.4 +/- 1.9 ml/m2 Postop) and RV ejection fraction (31.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 45.6 +/- 2.5% Postop), and an increase in RV end-systolic and end-diastolic volume indices. This depression responded readily to pharmacologic therapy within 2 h, resolved within 24 h, and had no adverse consequences in these otherwise healthy patients. Further studies are needed to identify the cause of this phenomenon and its importance in patients with preexisting cardiac dysfunction.\r"

Eleven patients with uncomplicated CAP were compared with 16 patients with fulminating pneumonia requiring intensive care management. An appropriate increase in quantitative alpha 1 PI was demonstrated in all patients. A significant functional inactivation of alpha 1 PI was demonstrated in the ICU-treated patients that was not apparent in the uncomplicated CAP patients (p less than .01). This low EIC returned to normal 4 wk after hospital discharge in all survivors. A significant (p less than .02) difference in EIC between the pulmonary arterial and systemic arterial blood was found in the nonsurvivors on admission, which suggests that alpha 1 PI is inactivated in the lungs of patients with fulminating CAP. The present data demonstrate that alpha 1 PI is functionally inactivated in patients with fulminating CAP. This low serum functional alpha 1 PI may result in proteolytic lung damage and an unfavorable outcome.\r"

In both group 1 (n = 12) and group 2 (n = 10) patients, we measured serum P, creatinine, ionized Ca, urinary P excretion, and creatinine clearance daily for the first 3 to 4 days postinjury. Patients in group 2 also received 0.5 mmol/kg.day of PO4 for the first 48 h after admission. Group 1 patients exhibited a significant (p less than .05) decrease in serum P over the first 24 h (1.00 +/- 0.30 to 0.75 +/- 0.23 mmol/L). In contrast, group 2 patients did not demonstrate a decrease in serum P. Urinary P excretion in group 1 accounts for the observed decrease in serum P. The results of our study show that the immediate posttraumatic period is associated with a decrease in serum P and massive urinary P excretion. We also showed that prophylactic administration of 0.5 mmol PO4/kg.day prevents serum P decrease.\r"

Five hypocalcemic patients were studied and were found to have higher calcitonin levels than normocalcemic patients and healthy controls and higher PTH levels than healthy controls. 25(OH)D3 and 1-25(OH)2D3 were not significantly different in the three groups of patients. Gastrin levels were low in critically ill patients, whether or not they were hypocalcemic. We conclude that hypocalcemia occurs frequently in critically ill children.

Radiography confirmed proper position in 97%. Duration of indwelling venous catheters was 2.5 +/- 1.6 days. All catheters functioned well until removal. We conclude that our technique of JBC is safe and highly successful. It compares favorably with previous, smaller series and with standard anterograde internal jugular catheterization in both children and adults.\r"

Correlation between the predictive and the reference methods was poor or absent. A discriminant analysis revealed that measurement of urinary creatinine was a major factor in CC estimation. In conclusion, the reference method of CC assessment is preferred to obtain a reliable estimation of glomerular filtration rate in ICU patients.\r"

Thirty-six patients received either FDA (n = 21) or crystalloid/hydroxyethyl starch (CHS) (n = 15) as part of a randomized, controlled trial. Ten patients received FDA as part of a humanitarian protocol. All were Jehovah's Witnesses who refused transfusion, had bled recently, and had average Hgb levels of 4.3 g/dl. After pulmonary artery catheter insertion, each patient was infused with CHS to attain a pulmonary artery wedge pressure (WP) of 10 to 18 mm Hg. FDA was given as a one-time dose of 30 ml/kg. Data were collected at baseline, 12, 24, and 48 h. None of the patients with negative reactions to a 0.5-ml test dose of FDA had adverse reactions to the subsequent infusion. The plasma or dissolved component of oxygen content was significantly higher in the FDA group at 12 h (FDA group 1.58 +/- 0.47 ml/dl, control group 1.01 +/- 0.31 ml/dl, p less than .02, t-test). Nineteen patients died: 12 (37.5%) FDA, seven (46.6%) control. The difference was not significant. We conclude the following: a) FDA can be given safely to severely anemic patients in doses of 30 ml/kg; b) FDA significantly increased the dissolved component of oxygen content after 12 h but the effect did not persist; c) severely anemic patients can survive without transfusion although mortality is high. In this study, inability of FDA to sustain increased oxygen content was due in part to the rapid elimination of FDA and also to the limited amount given.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Only two patients were discharged with the tracheostomy in situ. All patients were successfully decannulated at the first attempt. No tracheostomy-related complications or symptoms were reported apart from croup in two patients. On review, lung volumes and maximal inspiratory and expiratory flows were normal. There was no evidence of tracheal stenosis or significant tracheomalacia. RMS tests were normal. In this hospital, tracheostomy is a safe, well-tolerated procedure in the management of infants and children with GBS who need long-term ventilation. There were no deaths and all patients returned to their normal school or were gainfully employed after their illness, although 12 patients had mild persistent weakness of at least foot dorsiflexion.\r"

Twenty-eight patients were randomly allocated into a study group (A, n = 13) in which a nonabsorbable paste containing 2% tobramycin, 2% amphotericin B, and 2% polymyxin E was administered locally to decontaminate the oropharynx, and a control group (B, n = 15) in which a paste without antibiotics was also applied to the oropharynx. We studied the effectiveness of the prophylactic technique in decontaminating the oropharynx and trachea of organisms potentially pathogenic for the respiratory system. Decontamination was successful in ten of 13 patients in group A vs. one of 15 patients in group B (p less than .001). The results demonstrated a lower rate of infection in the lower respiratory tract in the study group (three patients with tracheobronchitis and no pneumonias) than in the control group (three patients with tracheobronchitis and 11 with pneumonia), the difference between both being highly significant (p less than .001). Two (15%) patients in group B developed sepsis of pulmonary origin. None of the patients on prophylactic treatment developed this complication. Although the overall mortality was similar in both groups (group A, 30% vs. group B, 33%), we believe that infection contributed to a great extent to the death of two of five patients in group B. We conclude that nosocomial pneumonia, which is a frequent complication in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation, could be prevented by local application of nonabsorbable antibiotics to the oropharynx.\r"

These abnormalities in immune response may contribute to the increased susceptibility to infection after injury and hemorrhage. To examine the relationship between serum Ig levels and bacterial antigen-specific plasma cell numbers and frequencies after blood loss, we treated hemorrhaged mice with intravenous Ig (IVIG). Hemorrhaged mice given IVIG had increased total numbers of splenic plasma cells compared with normal or hemorrhaged, untreated mice. Immunization with the bacterial polysaccharide antigen levan immediately after hemorrhage resulted in approximately 60% fewer levan-specific splenic plasma cells than those seen in normal unhemorrhaged mice. Treatment of hemorrhaged mice with IVIG did not correct the decrease in levan-specific plasma cells. These results demonstrate that hemorrhage-induced alterations in the numbers and frequencies of bacterial antigen-specific B cells are not related to changes in serum Ig levels and cannot be corrected through administration of IVIG.\r"

After a control period, animals were exposed to a simulated altitude of 8,000 ft (barometric pressure 564 torr), followed by a second control period at ground level. Both experimental groups had similar values of PaCO2 at ground level and during exposure to reduced barometric pressure. The tidal volume necessary to maintain eucapnia was higher in oleic acid-injured animals compared with the control group; cardiac output and functional residual capacity were lower. The alveolar-arterial oxygen difference was substantially larger in the oleic acid group.

  ".W": "The effects of Ringer's acetate, 6% dextran-70, 7.5% NaCl, and the combination of 7.5% NaCl and dextran-70 were tested in resuscitation from endotoxin shock induced by continuous iv infusion of Escherichia coli endotoxin in pigs. After about 3 h, a reproducible shock state was achieved and treatment was started, governed by the left atrial pressure. The hypertonic solutions (7.5% NaCl and 7.5% NaCl in dextran-70) did not show any overall advantages over the isotonic solutions (Ringer's acetate and dextran-70). Only transient beneficial hemodynamic effects lasting less than 30 min after infusion were seen. When dextran-70 was administered, cardiovascular function was markedly improved and oxygen delivery (DO2) and survival were significantly higher compared with the crystalloid groups (Ringer's acetate and 7.5% NaCl). Administration of large amounts of Ringer's acetate resulted in an immediate deterioration of pulmonary function. It was difficult to elevate left atrial pressure or even to keep it at baseline level, and cardiac index was only transiently increased. The overall result was a deterioration of DO2 and poor survival compared with the dextran-70 treated pigs. We conclude that dextran-70 is superior to Ringer's acetate in resuscitation from endotoxin-induced shock in pigs. Furthermore, we found no role for the use of hypertonic saline, alone or in combination with dextran, in the treatment of this type of prolonged endotoxin shock.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the validity of three equations for estimation of thoracic electrical field size in a new bioimpedance algorithm, stroke volume (SV) as calculated by these equations was compared with that calculated by Doppler echocardiography in 48 healthy volunteers, both lean and obese. When the volume of electrically participating tissue was estimated from body height (modified Sramek) or body height corrected for body habitus (Sramek-Bernstein), there was considerable variation between bioimpedance and Doppler stroke volumes. When the volume of electrically participating tissue was estimated from the actual measurement of the height of the thorax and the circumference at the base of the thorax, the variation in SV differences decreased substantially (Sramek equation), although still considerable for clinical use, and there was no relationship between SV thus obtained and body habitus. Analysis of calculated stroke indices derived by our Doppler echocardiographic standard, as compared with values in the literature, revealed a systematic underestimation. We conclude that the original Sramek equation systematically underestimates SV by 15% to 20%, and the modified Sramek and Sramek-Bernstein equations systematically underestimates SV by 15% to 20%, and the modified Sramek and Sramek-Bernstein equations systematically overestimate SV in females by about 15%, but provide SV values in males in the predicted range. Further studies on the current assumption that the electrical field size is a truncated cone may improve precision of the bioimpedance method.\r"

Based on national hospital survey data from Statistics Canada, we calculated the utilization of ICUs in all Canadian general hospitals from 1969 to 1986 and estimated costs for 1986. Using the American Hospital Association's Annual Survey, we estimated comparable trend data from U.S. hospitals for the period of 1979 to 1986, and national ICU costs for 1986. The results demonstrated steady growth in Canadian utilization from 1969 to 1986, with increased ICU patient days (17 to 42 days/1000 population). National costs for 1986 were estimated at $1.03 billion (Canadian), which was roughly 8% of total inpatient costs and 0.2% of Canada's gross national product (GNP). Utilization trend data for the United States showed a rapid increase from 1979 through 1982 with slower growth after that. In the United States, ICU utilization in 1986 was estimated at 108 patient days/1000 population. Total ICU costs were estimated at $33.9 billion (U.S.), which is 20% of all inpatient hospital costs and accounts for 0.8% of the GNP. ICU utilization in the United States is 2.5 times that of Canada.\r"

Despite these findings, tuberculin skin tests were not performed in any of the patients. Acid-fast smears of sputum were obtained in three cases and bronchoscopy performed in only four, reflecting the low index of suspicion for tuberculosis. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was the presumptive diagnosis in nine cases but was confirmed in only one case. Autopsy revealed tuberculosis as the cause of death in four patients. Of the seven patients who did not undergo autopsy, disseminated tuberculosis, manifest by mycobacteremia, was the only life-threatening illness identified and probably contributed to death. Increased awareness of the clinical and roentgenographic features of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients, combined with more intensive use of acid-fast smears and tuberculin skin testing, are necessary in order to decrease mortality from this treatable complication of HIV-infection.\r"

Non-white PE mortality was greater than white PE mortality; men had a greater risk of PE death than women. Age-specific patterns (more than 40 years of age) of PE mortality followed those of the age-adjusted death rates, with increases noted in all groups between 1962 and 1974 and declines during the 1975-1984 period. These patterns might reflect improved ascertainment of cases and better prevention of disease. The magnitude of the rates suggests that the list of indications for prophylactic anticoagulation should be re-examined for possible expansion.\r"

Post-phlebotomy the maximal oxygen consumption increased from 1.09 +/- 0.34 L/min to 1.26 +/- 0.43 L/min (p less than 0.05) and the maximum workload increased from 56.5 +/- 32.6 watts to 74.5 +/- 23.4 watts (p less than 0.05).

Three patients are reviewed. The perforations included one spontaneous, one from erosion of an esophageal carcinoma, and one iatrogenic. In two of the three patients, the diagnosis of perforated esophagus had not been made initially and in one patient the initial esophagram was interpreted as normal. Computed tomography of the chest in each patient led to the suspected diagnosis of perforated esophagus. Prompt appropriate surgical intervention followed. The findings of mediastinal fluid and more importantly mediastinal air on CT of the chest are strongly suggestive of esophageal perforation.\r"

We applied the Quality of Well-Being scale (QWB) in 28 patients with CF before and after a two-week course of oral ciprofloxacin used to treat pulmonary exacerbations. There were significant correlations between changes in QWB and various pulmonary function test results; QWB vs FEV1: r = 0.4, p less than 0.03; QWB vs FVC: r = 0.5, p less than 0.01; and QWB vs SaO2: r = 0.4, p less than 0.05. Thus, the QWB can track changes in general well-being in CF patients over a brief time and detect changes associated with pulmonary exacerbation and its treatment.\r"

Sixteen of 19 patients with MVD showed significant increase in respiratory resistance in methacholine inhalation test, while all normal subjects did not. The maximal expiratory flow at 25 percent of vital capacity (Vmax25), a parameter of small airway disease, correlated significantly with log cumulative dose producing a 35 percent decrease in respiratory conductance (PD35Grs) (r = 0.536) and the duration of symptoms (r = -0.682). There was a significant correlation between log PD35Grs and mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (r = -0.466). After MVR, log PD35Grs was significantly improved in all seven operated-on patients, although six patients retained BHR. We conclude that patients with long-term MVD have marked BHR and that BHR in long-term MVD is related to peripheral airway narrowing with organic remodeling, which was not ameliorated with MVR procedure, in addition to pulmonary congestion.\r"

The patients with CHF had a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 26 +/- 7 percent. Maximal respiratory pressures were significantly reduced; group mean values (+/- SD) for PImax at FRC were 41.4 +/- 5.6 cm H2O (CHF) and 102.1 +/- 27.4 cm H2O (AMN) (p less than 0.001), with PImax values in five patients with CHF as low as 20 to 30 cm H2O. In most patients, PEmax was comparably reduced. Handgrip force was less dramatically reduced, suggesting selective respiratory muscle weakness. Possible explanations include reduction in respiratory muscle blood flow or generalized muscular atrophy and weakness related to cardiac cachexia.\r"

Of the 35 patients completing the study, analysis of variance demonstrated no difference in percentage of change in FEV1 between glycopyrrolate and metaproterenol. Two hours after the initial dose, there was a 30 percent increase in FEV1 for glycopyrrolate compared with a 25 percent increase for metaproterenol (p greater than 0.05, NS). In contrast to the comparable bronchodilator activity, the side effects profile of the two agents were markedly dissimilar. Not only were subjective complaints of tremor, palpitations, and paresthesias increased for metaproterenol, but the heart rate response was significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) compared with glycopyrrolate. Based on these data, administration of the aerosolized anticholinergic agent, glycopyrrolate, is a reasonable therapeutic alternative for acute asthma.\r"

Follow-up reveals that only one patient has died secondary to an arrhythmia. All patients except one are symptomatically improved, and 18 patients remain angina free at a mean follow-up of 22.3 months.

  ".W": "Pulmonary hypertension causes right ventricular ischemia and failure as a result of increased afterload combined with reduced coronary blood flow. Increasing coronary driving pressure by raising aortic pressure with phenylephrine has been shown to reverse right ventricular ischemia from pulmonary hypertension in animals. Since vasodilators often fail to reduce afterload, we tested whether raising the coronary driving pressure would improve right ventricular function in man. Ten patients with pulmonary hypertension had hemodynamics and right ventricular coronary driving pressure measured before and 10 minutes after a steady state was reached with a phenylephrine infusion titrated to raise aortic pressure by 25 percent. Phenylephrine caused a significant (p less than .01) increase in mean aortic pressure (84 to 108 mm Hg) and right ventricular coronary driving pressure (46 to 69 mm Hg). In response, there was a significant (p less than .01) rise in mean pulmonary artery pressure (58 to 67 mm Hg), right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (10 to 16 mm Hg) and wedge pressure (5 to 9 mm Hg), and an insignificant fall in cardiac output (3.26 to 3.09 L/min) and pulmonary artery O2 saturation (57 to 49 percent). Although phenylephrine increased right ventricular coronary driving pressure, it worsened right ventricular function as manifest by a rise in end-diastolic pressure and fall in cardiac output. Any benefit of raising right ventricular coronary driving pressure may have been offset by alpha vasoconstriction of right ventricular coronary blood flow and/or pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction. Phenylephrine does not appear to be a useful therapy of right ventricular failure from pulmonary hypertension in patients who fail vasodilators.\r"

Our group recently extended this treatment to three patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. All patients had marked decreases in pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance and increases in cardiac output following single lung transplantation. Spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity were not different in comparison to preoperative studies. Quantitative ventilation-perfusion scans revealed the majority of perfusion distributed to the transplanted lung, with ventilation approximately equally divided between the native and the transplanted lung. Despite ventilation-perfusion imbalance, there was no resting hypoxemia and there was no arterial oxygen desaturation with exercise. One patient expired on the 30th postoperative day due to cytomegalovirus infection of the lungs. In the remaining two patients, maximum exercise capacity following transplantation was near normal in one recipient and reduced in the second recipient. Of note, there was no evidence of ventilatory limitation or impaired oxygenation during exercise in these two recipients. Although an exaggerated exercise ventilatory response was present, this did not limit exercise performance. This report supports the use of single lung transplantation for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension.\r"

A total of 40 patients with a nonspecific histologic findings of pleural biopsy specimen were categorized based on their ultimate diagnosis as having tuberculous (n = 15), carcinomatous (n = 10) or nontuberculous, benign pleuritis (n = 15). The pleural biopsy specimen of patients with nontuberculous, benign pleuritis frequently showed a band-like infiltration of mononuclear cells in the subpleural adipose tissue with minimal pleural inflammatory infiltrate (10 out of 15 patients), while the same finding was infrequent in those with tuberculous pleuritis (0 out of 15, p = 0.0001) and pleuritis associated with carcinoma (three out of 10, p = 0.082). Based on these results, the presence of band-like infiltration of mononuclear cells in the subpleural adipose tissue with minimal pleural inflammatory infiltrate in pleural biopsy specimens of patients with lymphocyte-rich pleural effusion suggests that the pleuritis is nontuberculous in its nature.\r"

Ossification, calcification and fibrovascular ingrowth into the normally avascular hyaline bronchial cartilage were observed in almost all patients and were independent of small or large airway inflammation. Alterations in the integrity of hyaline cartilage have been produced by others in animals by ligation of the blood supply. Finding similar changes in airway cartilage of all transplanted lungs argues that there is relatively poor perfusion to the proximal air-conducting passage. Such a mechanism may contribute to the development of OB, bronchiectasis and a predilection for infections following pulmonary transplantation.\r"

To determine the frequency, chemical characteristics and clinical associations of hypothyroidism and pleural effusions, the medical records of 128 patients with hypothyroidism (defined by an increased serum TSH concentration) were reviewed. The majority of effusions in patients with hypothyroidism were due to other diseases. Effusions solely due to hypothyroidism appeared to be a real entity.

To explore this hypothesis, we assessed the responsiveness of EA and bronchi and the cough sensitivity to inhaled histamine in nine hypertensive patients with captopril-induced cough (group 1) during treatment and one month after withdrawal of the drug treatment. Nine patients who were asymptomatic while receiving captopril (group 2) and nine patients receiving no current treatment (group 3) served as controls. The EA responsiveness was assessed by using the maximal midinspiratory flow (MIF50) as an arbitrary index of EA constriction and was expressed as the histamine concentration causing a 25 percent decrease in MIF50 (PC25MIF50). PC15FEV1 was the index of bronchial responsiveness and PCcough (dose causing five or more coughs) was that of cough sensitivity. Airway hyperresponsiveness (EA-HR or BHR) was diagnosed when PC25MIF50 or PC15FEV1 were 8 mg/ml or lower. Patients with captopril-cough, as compared with controls, had significantly lower values of PC25MIF50, PC15FEV1, and PCcough; EA-HR and BHR were found, respectively, in seven and three of these patients and in none of the control subjects. In all the patients of group 1, cough and EA-HR resolved after withdrawal of captopril treatment, while BHR persisted in one. PC25MIF50, PC15FEV1, and PCcough were all significantly improved. Our findings suggest that cough during captopril therapy may originate from receptors in the EA.\r"

Six autopsy lung specimens were studied. Thalassemia patients exhibited pulmonary dysfunction, characterized by hypoxemia (85 percent of the patients were outside the 95 percent confidence limits), reduced lung volumes (51 percent), flow rates (63 percent) and DCO (50 percent). Right ventricular dysfunction was more prevalent than left ventricular dysfunction. Furthermore, 75 percent of the patients had evidence of pulmonary hypertension consistent with more frequent right ventricular rather than left ventricular dysfunction.

This abnormal spot was definitely identified as liquid paraffin by infrared spectroscopy and gas liquid chromatography for the first patient. The number and percentage of AMs were largely decreased in the BALF of each patient, whereas the number of neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes was increased.

The time required to obtain a pathologic diagnosis also is important. We are able to obtain the results of a cytologic diagnosis within 10 min. Cytologic diagnosis of malignancy during thoractomy may be a feasible and convenient method of diagnosis, especially where malignancy is suspected.\r"

The results show that simultaneous determination of TATI in plasma and pleural fluid improves the diagnosis of cancer only marginally. Our results also support the hypothesis that elevated TATI levels may reflect an acute phase reaction caused by inflammatory disease or tissue destruction associated with cancer not only in inflammatory conditions, but also in malignant disease where the tumor itself is not producing TATI.\r"
