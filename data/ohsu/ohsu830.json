  ".W": "The hemodynamic effects of the calcium entry blocker felodipine were studied during and after different infusion rates. Eight healthy normotensive volunteers had their individual pharmacokinetics of felodipine determined, and they subsequently entered a double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Individualized infusions of felodipine were given by a computerized infusion pump to reach plasma concentrations of 6 ng/ml (15.6 nmol/L) after 20 minutes, to be sustained for 8 hours (fast infusion) or the same plasma concentration after 8 hours (slow infusion). Control infusions with saline and vehicle were given. Blood pressure, heart rate, ECG conduction times, and baroreceptor sensitivity by the Valsalva test were measured, as well as the plasma concentrations of felodipine. The infusion system used produced the expected plasma concentration-time profiles with higher plasma concentrations after the fast infusion until 8 hours. Both slow and fast infusion increased heart rate (p less than 0.05) and produced a similar decrease in diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05). Slow infusion therefore reduced blood pressure more effectively. The tachycardia after the fast infusion was more pronounced during the first hour of the infusion but was indistinguishable from the slow infusion later, when plasma concentrations were still significantly different. Baroreceptor responsiveness was diminished by both felodipine treatments. There was no obvious difference in side effects caused by the two infusion regimes. The initial tachycardia after felodipine can be diminished by a slow rate of administration of the drug with a similar effect on blood pressure.\r"

Forty-nine patients with primary hypertension were included in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, and 44 completed the trial. Both diltiazem and metoprolol significantly lowered office (p less than 0.001) and diurnal ambulatory BP (p less than 0.01). After 16 weeks of therapy with diltiazem, mean ambulatory BP decreased 10/7 mm Hg, whereas metoprolol lowered BP by 16/10 mm Hg (p less than 0.001 for systolic BP and p less than 0.01 for diastolic BP). Moreover, metoprolol seemed to induce a greater reduction in morning BP at work. Although diltiazem had no effect on lipid levels, treatment with metoprolol was associated with a significant rise in triglyceride levels (p less than 0.001 vs baseline and diltiazem), total cholesterol levels (p less than 0.05 vs baseline), atherogenic index (p less than 0.05 vs baseline and diltiazem) and very low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol levels (p less than 0.001 vs baseline and diltiazem) and a significant decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p less than 0.01 vs baseline and p less than 0.001 vs diltiazem). These data suggest that both diltiazem and metoprolol provide adequate office BP control. The deleterious effects of metoprolol on lipid and lipoprotein levels may counterbalance its beneficial effects on reduction of ambulatory BP.\r"

The present study was designed to simplify the original protocol, which is too cumbersome for epidemiological studies. 2. A preliminary study conducted on nine volunteers showed that sharp modifications of lithium intake are detected within 24 h in urinary excretion. The average intake over a 5-day period could be predicted by the mean excretion of the last 3 days. Lithium recovery established from 1 baseline day and 3 plateau days was 95 +/- 6% (mean +/- SD), not significantly different from the recovery obtained by the integrated excretion curve over 12 days. 3. A simplified protocol was therefore developed, reducing to 4 the 12 days of urine collection originally required. 4. This simplified protocol was tested on five households (14 adults and five children). All domestic salt was substituted with lithium-tagged salt. Urine samples were collected on 1 baseline day and on 3 plateau days. The lithium/sodium ratio of all urine collections (both complete and incomplete) could be used to estimate the proportion of discretionary sodium. In our sample it was about 29% of total sodium intake. 5. The simplified protocol can thus be proposed for population studies.\r"

To determine the relationships between parathyroid hormone activity and long-term sodium fluoride therapy in osteoporosis, cytochemical bioassays (for biologically active parathyroid hormone) were performed in 22 osteoporotic control patients and in 18 patients after 15 +/- 10 months of treatment (60 mg of sodium fluoride daily). Ten patients were studied longitudinally by repeated metabolic balances and were therefore common to both groups. All patients were receiving mineral supplements. 2. Cross-sectional data showed a fourfold mean increase in biologically active parathyroid hormone on fluoride treatment (P less than 0.005) together with a 51% increase in serum alkaline phosphatase (P less than 0.005). Longitudinal data showed, in addition, a significant increase in the calcium balance of 2.4 +/- 1.2 (SEM) mmol daily (P less than 0.05) and the development of a positive phosphorus balance (P less than 0.02). 3. Fluoride-treated patients were then analysed in two groups according to the level of biologically active parathyroid hormone. Thirty-two per cent of values were above the upper limit of normal (18 pg/ml). The mean serum alkaline phosphatase level in this group showed no elevation above that of the control patients, the overall rise being accounted for entirely by patients with normal levels of biologically active parathyroid hormone. High levels of biologically active parathyroid hormone were also associated with relative hypophosphataemia (P less than 0.01), relative hypercalciuria (P less than 0.05) and an increased urine/faecal calcium ratio (P less than 0.025). 4. Results show that long-term fluoride and calcium therapy increase biologically active parathyroid hormone in osteoporosis and that excessive parathyroid hormone activity may account for certain features of the refractory state.\r"

The possibility that abnormalities of skeletal muscle may limit the exercise tolerance of patients with chronic renal failure was investigated in patients undergoing regular haemodialysis. 2. Blood flow to the calf, a vascular bed consisting predominantly of skeletal muscle, was measured in six patients before and after exercise and compared with values obtained from 12 control subjects. 3. The patients were limited on exertion and had an abnormal response of calf blood flow to bicycle exercise. Resting calf blood flow was similar in patients and control subjects, but the mean increase in calf blood flow in response to submaximal exercise was 0.55 (SEM 0.12) ml min-1 100 ml-1 in the patients and 1.43 (SEM 0.17) ml min-1 100 ml-1 in the control subjects. The increase after symptom-limited maximal exercise was 1.50 (SEM 0.80) ml min-1 100 ml-1 in the patients and 4.20 (SEM 0.40) ml min-1 100 ml-1 in the control subjects. 4. Skeletal muscle biopsies from eight haemodialysis patients were studied by histochemistry and electron microscopy. 5. Oxidative enzyme activity was increased and there were large subsarcolemmal aggregates of structurally normal mitochondria. Necrotic capillaries were observed as empty basement membrane tubes containing fragments of degenerating endothelium. 6. The changes were compatible with a response to a chronic reduction in skeletal muscle blood flow.\r"

The recovery of label was measured as [15N2]urea or [14N, 15N]urea in urine and as 15N in stool. 2. Five patients with a loop colostomy allowed a comparison of the right functioning colon with the left defunctioned colon in the same individual. Five subjects with a left end-colostomy enabled a comparison of the right with the left functioning colon. 3. A significantly greater proportion of labelled urea was recovered as [15N2]urea in the urine when the dose was placed in the left defunctioned colon (29%) compared with either the left or the right functioning colon (9 and 4%, respectively). This is interpreted as being a result of a decrease in the bacterial activity and concomitant urea hydrolysis in the defunctioned colon. 4. On average more than half of the label was retained in the body, regardless of whether the urea was placed in the functioning or the defunctioned colon, on the left or on the right. 5. The data confirm that the colon is permeable to the intact urea molecule. Intraluminal urea is readily hydrolysed in the functioning colon. A large proportion of the nitrogen released by urea hydrolysis may be retained within the metabolic nitrogen pool of the host. There are significant differences in the handling of urea nitrogen in the defunctioned colon relative to the functioning colon.\r"

Using this regimen, tubular, glomerular or vascular morphological damage was not evident on light microscopy. 3. The administration of nifedipine simultaneously with cyclosporin A from day 1 prevented the characteristic decline in renal function and increase in renal vascular resistance. However, the administration of nifedipine to spontaneously hypertensive rats previously exposed to cyclosporin A for 7 days failed to improve renal haemodynamics. 4. This study suggests that the beneficial effect conferred by nifedipine on cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity is present only when treatment is initiated simultaneously with cyclosporin A.\r"

This paper reports a comparison of the kinetics of influx into hamster jejunum of a series of dipeptides of neutral, basic and acidic amino acids, and a tripeptide of neutral amino acids, with those of corresponding free amino acids. 2. Kt, the substrate concentration at which the transport rate is half the maximal transport rate, and Vmax, the maximal transport rate, were more similar from one peptide to another than among amino acids, with the result that, over a wide range of concentrations, rates of influx of individual peptides varied much less than those of amino acids. 3. It is suggested that this may account for the rates of absorption of amino acids being closely related to the amino acid composition of the protein fed, instead of being widely dissimilar as with corresponding mixtures of free amino acids. 4. With neutral amino acids, both Kt and Vmax. fell with increasing length of the side-chain, as observed on many previous occasions. This did not occur with the corresponding homologous dipeptides, which shows that the hypothesis that the apparent affinity for transport is related to the lipophilic properties of the side-chain cannot be applied to peptides.\r"

NG-Monomethyl-L-arginine, the novel inhibitor of endothelium-derived relaxing factor synthesis, caused concentration-dependent but only partial inhibition of maximal relaxation induced by acetylcholine in human subcutaneous resistance arteries. 3. The inhibitory action of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine on acetylcholine-induced maximal relaxation was partially reversed by incubation of the arteries in equimolar concentrations of L-arginine and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Subsequent incubation in L-arginine led to further reversal, but this was no greater than with incubation in physiological saline. 4. A component of acetylcholine-induced relaxation was sensitive to indomethacin, suggesting that this response is mediated by prostanoids as well as by endothelium-derived relaxing factor. 5. NG-Monomethyl-L-arginine did not increase the tension of resting human subcutaneous resistance arteries. NG-Monomethyl-L-arginine did enhance the contractile response to noradrenaline, possibly due to inhibition of release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor resulting from stimulation of alpha 2-adrenoreceptors on the endothelial cells.\r"

After 24 h occlusion with a plastic chamber on the 4th day, skin surface water loss (SSWL) (g/m2h) was recorded continuously for 25 min with an evaporimeter. The differences between the surfactants were statistically significant (Friedman's test p less than 0.01). SLS and the A/N mix revealed significant differences compared to the other compounds (p less than 0.05), both in decay constants and in values recorded at the beginning and at the end of the decay curve. The study suggests a mechanism for the high irritant potential of sodium lauryl sulphate compared to other surfactants: sorbitan monolaurate and benzalkonium chloride seem to influence (at the concentrations tested) to a lesser extent the water-holding capacity of the stratum corneum. The clinical and biological relevance of these observations requires long-term clinical correlations with final product use tests.\r"

It was found that 2/3 of the patients had consulted a doctor on some occasion and 1/5 had been on sick leave for their hand eczema. The mean total time on sick leave was 18.9 weeks, the median 8 weeks. Patients in service occupations reported more periods of sick leave than other occupational groups. Local steroid preparations were used by 1/2 the patients, emollients by 85%. Change of work was reported by 8% and was most common in service occupations. Hairdressers had the highest rate of change. 80% of the patients experienced some kind of disturbance to their social and emotional lives, considered to be caused by the hand eczema. Frequent itching was reported by 1/2 the patients, occasional itching by another 1/3. Comparing different types of hand eczema, allergic contact dermatitis seemed throughout to cause more serious consequences. It is concluded that good care of a hand eczema patient includes attention to the impact of the disease on the patient's total situation.\r"

  ".W": "PRL is known to be a hormone carrying luteotropic action in rats and enhances progesterone secretion by suppressing 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20 alpha HSD) activity in the corpus luteum. In this study, we investigated the effects of PRL and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) on the 20 alpha HSD activity of rat luteal cells in vitro and examined whether TGF beta is involved in the luteotropic action of PRL. 20 alpha HSD activity of luteal cells (from midpseudopregnant rats), which had been suppressed by PRL in vivo, increased when the cells were cultured for 48 h without PRL addition. TGF beta (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 ng/ml) as well as PRL (2, 20, 200, and 2000 ng/ml) suppressed this increase in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of PRL on 20 alpha HSD activity was significantly attenuated by anti-TGF beta antibody. Activin, having homology with TGF beta in its chemical structure, also suppressed the increase in enzyme activity, although the effect was much less marked than that of TGF beta. TGF beta or PRL did not affect total progestin (progesterone plus 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone) secretion, but induced reduction in 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone secretion during a 48-h culture period, without any alteration of DNA or protein content per culture dish. These results indicate that TGF beta, like PRL, can suppress luteal 20 alpha HSD activity without producing nonspecific cell damage, and that the luteotropic action of PRL is at least in part mediated by TGF beta or an immunoreactive TGF beta-like substance(s).\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis after discontinuation of prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids, we employed adult male Sprague-Dawley rats which were implanted sc with osmotic minipumps filled with saline (vehicle) or dexamethasone (DEX), 100 micrograms/day, for 7 days. At the end of the glucocorticoid treatment period, the minipumps were removed and both saline- and DEX-treated rats were randomly assigned to five different groups tested at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after removal of the minipumps. Each group was divided into two subgroups receiving either arecoline (ARE), or ovine CRH (oCRH) stimulation tests. ARE was chosen because it has been shown to selectively stimulate the hypothalamic CRH neuron, whereas oCRH was selected as a probe of the pituitary component of the HPA axis. ARE (0.2 mg/kg) and oCRH (10 micrograms/kg) were injected iv to catheterized, freely moving rats and serial blood samples for plasma ACTH and corticosterone determinations were drawn from the catheter before, and 5, 15, 30, and 60 min after the injection. The day after the tests were performed, the rats were killed by decapitation, and body, adrenal and thymus weights, as well as hypothalamic CRH and pituitary ACTH content were determined. On the day of the stimulation tests, basal plasma levels of ACTH and corticosterone were not different between saline- and DEX-treated rats at any time-point after discontinuation of treatment. The ACTH response to ARE, on the other hand, was suppressed one day after, but became normal 3 days after discontinuation of DEX treatment. ACTH response to oCRH normalized later, after 7 days. Interestingly, corticosterone responses to both ARE and oCRH normalized 7 days after discontinuation of glucocorticoid administration. Body, adrenal and thymus weights were significantly reduced by DEX treatment. They recovered slowly and only after 22 days there was no difference between DEX- and saline-treated rats in body and adrenal weight. In contrast, thymus weight was still low on day 8, began to increase after 15 days, and by day 22 did not reach the values recorded in saline-treated rats. Hypothalamic immunoreactive CRH content was not different between DEX- and saline-treated rats, whereas the content of ACTH in the pituitary gland was lower in the DEX-treated rats the second day after discontinuation of GC treatment, normalized after 4 days and increased significantly after 8 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dietary iodine has been shown to be important in the induction of thyroiditis in susceptible chicken strains although the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Iodine may exert its effects through the formation of reactive oxidative radicals which would cause thyroidal injury and initiate infiltration. We have tested this hypothesis by examining the ability of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), ethoxyquin, and other antioxidants to prevent thyroiditis in Obese strain (OS) chickens, a strain that develops severe disease by 4 weeks of age. BHA, when administered from hatching until death at 5 weeks of age, reduced thyroidal infiltration and serum levels of antibodies binding thyroglobulin, T3, T4. Similar effects were observed with the antioxidant ethoxyquin. Weaker antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and beta-carotene had only slight or negligible effects on these parameters. BHA reduced thyroiditis in OS chicks killed at 3 and 5 weeks of age, but not at 8 weeks. When BHA treatment was initiated after the development of severe disease, it did not reduce thyroglobulin antibody levels. To determine the mechanism by which BHA reduces thyroiditis, studies were performed to assess the effect of BHA on thyroid function and on the immune responses to exogenous antigens. BHA had no effect on thyroid function in normal strain chickens since thyroidal radioiodine uptake and organification and serum T3 and T4 levels were unaffected. BHA did not alter immune responses to exogenous antigens such as sheep red blood cells or Brucella abortus in OS chickens. In summary, potent antioxidant drugs delayed the onset of thyroiditis when treatment was initiated before the onset of disease, suggesting that reactive oxygen intermediates are involved in the early stages of pathogenesis. However, the site of action remains unknown since they had no detectable effects on thyroid function or general immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "Excess iodine has been associated with an increased incidence of lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT) in the BB/W rat, obese strain chicken, and hamster. The spontaneous incidence of LT in the Buffalo (Buf) rat is increased by neonatal thymectomy. In the present study, the effect of combined thymectomy and excess iodine ingestion on the incidence of LT in Buf rats has been examined. Buf rats were thymectomized at 1 day of age and randomized at 4 weeks of age to receive either standard rat chow with tap water (controls), or standard rat chow with 0.05% iodine in the drinking water (iodine group) for 12 weeks. The serum was assayed for TSH, antithyroglobulin antibodies, and iodine. The thyroids were fixed in Bouin's solution and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and the presence of thyroiditis was determined. Iodine increased the incidence of LT from 31% in the control group to 73% in the iodine-treated group (P less than 0.05). Serum TSH concentrations and levels of thyroglobulin antibodies were significantly higher in the iodine-treated rats, primarily due to the increased incidence of LT and subsequent iodine-induced hypothyroidism. These data suggest that iodine enhances the effect of neonatal thymectomy on LT in Buf rats and support the concept that iodine may play an important role in the expression of LT in predisposed animals.\r"

The identification of this T3 metabolite was based on the following evidence: 1) the compound co-eluted in two different HPLC systems with synthetic 3,3'-TA2S; 2) its chromatographic behavior on Sephadex LH-20 was characteristic for a conjugated iodothyronine derivative; and 3) the metabolite was hydrolyzed by arylsulfatase and the liberated product comigrated with synthetic 3,3'-TA2 on HPLC. Marked accumulation of 3,3'-TA2S was observed only in rats with impaired type I deidodinase activity but not in controls. Furthermore, plasma and biliary 3,3'-TA2S levels varied with the experimental conditions such as anesthesia, i.e. both were increased in ketamine-anesthetized over pentobarbital-anesthetized animals. It was not possible to indicate the exact pathway through which 3,3'-TA2S is generated from T3; neither is it known how much of T3 is actually metabolized via 3,3'-TA2S. However, the significant plasma 3,3'-TA2S levels, even in unanesthetized animals, illustrate the physiological relevance of this T3 metabolite.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of locally produced insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in connective tissues has recently been recognized. It has been postulated that the action of anabolic hormones on bone may be mediated through local IGF-I release. However, whether IGF-I can also be modulated by other locally acting cytokines has not been addressed. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) is a polypeptide thought to be involved in the regulation of tissue growth and repair. Although the occurrence of TGF beta is ubiquitous, particularly high amounts are found in bone and cartilage. In this study the effect of TGF beta-1 on immunoreactive IGF-I production by osteoblasts and chondrocytes was investigated and compared to that of PTH on osteoblasts or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on chondrocytes. Both TGF beta-1 and PTH stimulated IGF-I release from osteoblasts, which was further enhanced when both were consecutively present. Contrastingly, although bFGF stimulated IGF-I release by chondrocytes, TGF beta-1 was inhibitory and also blunted the effect of bFGF when both were present concurrently. These findings demonstrate that the regulation of local IGF-I production in bone and cartilage may differ and illustrate the complex nature of local cytokine interactions.\r"

  ".U": "90382310\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of amiodarone, an iodinated antiarrhythmic drug, on thyroid hormone metabolism are known. It is not known whether the main metabolite, desethylamiodarone, is responsible. We investigated the influence of both compounds on the intracellular rT3, T4, and T3 concentrations in tissues of the rat, the source of T3 (plasma-derived vs. produced locally from T4) and T3 and T4 production by the thyroid. Special attention is paid to the heart. We found that both amiodarone and desethylamiodarone cause a decrease in intracellular T3 in all tissues (P less than 0.001), in most tissues an increase in T4 and a greater increase in the rT3 concentration. Both compounds inhibit both deiodination (P less than 0.0001) and T3 production by the thyroid (P less than 0.0001); T4 production was enhanced (P less than 0.05). In the heart a hypothyroid-like state, caused by decreased plasma-derived T3 (P less than 0.0001), was found. But a pool of T3 produced locally from T4 was present (21% of the total T3, P less than 0.01), which has never been demonstrated under normal conditions. This pool might play a role in the mechanism of action of the drugs. Differences between the drugs were organ-specific, but the effects of desethylamiodarone were as strong as or stronger than those of amiodarone. We conclude that desethylamiodarone was responsible for the changes, although the possibility of a common metabolite, generated later, has not been excluded.\r"

GR mRNA levels were 2-fold higher in female than in male abdominal tissue or adipocytes, whereas in gluteal tissue or adipocytes no sex differences were observed. GR mRNA levels in female abdominal adipocytes were 50% higher than in corresponding female gluteal adipocytes; the opposite was observed corresponding in males. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA isolated from abdominal and gluteal adipocytes showed hybridization of the human GR probe to an RNA species of approximately 7.1 kilobases in both regions. No sex or regional differences in GR mRNA stability were observed. The human metallothionein II (hMTII) mRNA, which is regulated by glucocorticoids at the transcriptional level, showed an opposite sex and regional pattern as GR mRNA. However, in gluteal adipose tissue no sex differences were observed in hMTII mRNA levels. The expression of beta-actin mRNA, which is not regulated by glucocorticoids, showed no sex or regional variation. By immunocytochemistry, using an anti-GR-monoclonal antibody, cytoplasmic as well as nuclear staining for GR was demonstrated in both sexes and both regions. In conclusion, variations in GR mRNA levels between sexes and body regions may explain the well known sex and tissue differences in effects of glucocorticoids on human adipose tissue.\r"

  ".W": "In baboons, transplacental cortisol (F)/cortisone (E) metabolism changes from reduction (E to F) at midgestation to oxidation (F to E) near term when estrogen becomes elevated. Indeed, estrogen regulates the placental microsomal 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD) enzyme catalyzing F oxidation. However, regulation of 11 beta-HSD-reductase (E to F) is unknown, because this enzyme is destroyed by microsomal isolation. Therefore, we used cell culture to determine the role of estrogen on placental reduction of E to F and to ascertain whether estrogen regulation of the oxidation of F to E was specific to trophoblast. Placentas were obtained on day 165 (n = 6; term, day 184) and on day 100 of gestation from baboons untreated (n = 8) or treated (n = 6) with 50-mg implants of androstenedione (delta 4A) inserted sc in the mother between days 70 and 100 of gestation to increase placental estrogen production. After removal of fetal membranes, the decidua basalis and trophoblast were separated, rinsed repeatedly in medium-199, minced, and then incubated in trypsin/DNase. Dispersed cells were layered onto a discontinuous Percoll gradient (5-70%), and purified cytotrophoblast (TC; 1.048-1.062 g/ml) and decidua (DC; 1.048-1.062 g/ml) were harvested. After incubation in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum to permit attachment, cells were incubated (24 h) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10,100, or 500 ng [3H]F or [3H]E. F and E in medium were purified by HPLC and the interconversion of F/E calculated. Equilibrium was achieved by 12 h, and F/E metabolism was proportional to cell number and substrate (10-500 ng) concentration. At substrate concentrations of 500 ng/ml, the reduction of E to F (range, 81-195 ng F produced/24 h) in the DC (0.5 x 10(6) cells) was greater (P less than 0.05) than oxidation of F to E (19-28 ng E/24 h) in all groups. This pattern of metabolism by DC was not affected by time of gestation or treatment with delta 4A. In the TC (2.5 x 10(6) cells), oxidation of F to E always exceeded (P less than 0.05) reduction of E to F. Moreover, the conversion of F to E by TC of day 100 (86 +/- 26 ng E/24 h; mean +/- SE) was increased (P less than 0.05) by delta 4A (195 +/- 35) and greater (P less than 0.05) at day 165 (213 +/- 40). In contrast, TC metabolism of E (21-57 ng F/24 h) was similar in all groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ovine PRL (oPRL) was employed to investigate the role of anterior pituitary lobe microtubules in suckling-induced PRL secretion in the lactating rat. Groups of primiparous rats on days 12-14 postpartum were isolated from their pups for 4-5 h, then suckled for 10 min, and killed, and the anterior pituitary lobes were dissected out. Each pituitary lobe was processed to obtain the two tubulin pools, viz. soluble and polymerized tubulin fractions. After 10 min of suckling the pituitary soluble tubulin levels were reduced by about 25% (P less than 0.05), and polymerized tubulin levels increased by about 40% (P less than 0.05). When 3 mg oPRL were injected 4 h before suckling, the suckling-induced rise in the polymerized tubulin levels in the anterior pituitary lobe as well as plasma PRL levels were significantly inhibited (P less than 0.05). In the suckled rats injected with oPRL a 25% reduction in the total tubulin levels (soluble and polymerized) was observed. In a second experiment, each anterior pituitary lobe obtained from groups of rats suckled for 10 min was processed to obtain the total tubulin fraction. Suckling for 10 min stimulated the in vitro assembly of total tubulin fraction into microtubules by about 150% (P less than 0.05); 3 mg oPRL injected 4 h before suckling inhibited the suckling-induced rise in tubulin assembly (P less than 0.05). In a third experiment, suckling for 10 min stimulated GTPase activity in the total tubulin fraction by about 60% (P less than 0.05). Administration of oPRL 4 h before suckling caused about an 80% increase in GTPase activity. At a 1:2000 dilution, antitubulin antibodies maximally inhibited GTPase activity by about 40%, suggesting that a significant proportion of the enzyme activity can be due to tubulin present in the pituitary. These results suggest that PRL secretion is coupled to pituitary microtubules and that in addition to tubulin, other GTP-binding proteins might be involved in PRL secretion.\r"

  ".U": "90382322\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported that in contrast to what has been described in adult lung, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] has specific binding sites in rat fetal lung at the end of gestation, and it stimulates in vitro the phospholipid biosynthesis and surfactant release from fetal rat type II pneumocytes. In the present study an immunohistochemical technique using a rat monoclonal antibody (9A7 gamma) and binding studies were carried out on fresh lung tissues from fetal and newborn rats during the perinatal period to identify the cell(s) directly responsive to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in fetal lung and to look for a down-regulation of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors in the perinatal period. We also searched for a regulation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding to fetal lung by 1,25-(OH)2D3 itself and by factors known to affect lung maturation or be involved in parturition. Our results suggest that 1) fetal type II pneumocytes are target cells for 1,25-(OH)2D3; 2) a physiological down-regulation of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors in rat lung occurs in the perinatal period, starting a few hours before birth and lasting at least up to the fifth day of life; and 3) the capacity of rat fetal lung to bind 1,25-(OH)2D3 can be modulated in vitro by different hormones; a small inhibitory effect is observed with oxytocin (100 microU/ml), while PRL (10(-8) M), T4 (10(-6)-10(-10) M), 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10(-9)-10(-10) M), and, to a lesser extent, dexamethasone (10(-7) M) induce a 2- to 4-fold increase in the number of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors without altering the binding affinity of receptor for 1,25-(OH)2D3.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an inflammatory cytokine that stimulates T-cell activation and B-cell differentiation. We recently reported that picomolar concentrations of IL-6 stimulated PRL, GH, and LH release in vitro. These data suggested that IL-6 may function as a hypothalamic releasing factor for anterior pituitary hormones. Medial basal hypothalami (MBH) were incubated for 60-90 min in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 0.025% BSA, and the conditioned medium was assayed for IL-6 concentrations by the 7TD1 cell growth factor assay. It was found that MBH released IL-6 in vitro. Although depolarizing concentrations of K+ (56 mM) did not increase IL-6 release, somatostatin release from the MBH was increased significantly. The bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1-100 ng/ml) induced significant increases in IL-6 release from the MBH. The presence of IL-6 in the hypothalamus suggested a possible role for this cytokine in the regulation of neuropeptide release; however, the release of somatostatin was not affected by 20 ng/ml IL-6. Comparison studies of neural and neuroendocrine tissues revealed that the anterior and posterior pituitaries released larger amounts of bioactive IL-6 than the MBH or parietal cortex during a 4-h incubation; induction of IL-6 release by endotoxin occurred only in the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus. IL-6 mRNA was detectable in the MBH and anterior pituitary tissue after a 4-h incubation; however, no IL-6 mRNA was detectable in freshly isolated tissues. LPS (100 ng/ml) and (Bu)2cAMP (1 mM) increased IL-6 mRNA accumulation in and IL-6 release from the MBH and anterior pituitary. These data suggest that the MBH synthesizes and releases IL-6 via a nonneuronal source in vitro.\r"

  ".U": "90382327\r", 
  ".W": "The neonatal period is a time of transition between pituitary-independent fetal growth and the pituitary-dependent growth seen in older mammals. To evaluate pituitary-dependent neonatal growth, Wistar rats were hypophysectomized (Hx) on postnatal day 6. Nineteen days post-Hx, body weight and tail length were inhibited 48% and 34%, respectively, compared with sham-Hx controls. Organ weights determined on days 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 revealed three patterns of pituitary-dependence: 1) pituitary-independent growth in the brain and lung; 2) moderate pituitary-dependent growth in the heart, liver, kidney, and intestine; and 3) marked pituitary-dependent growth in the adrenals, spleen, and testes. Both serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and -II levels fell significantly in Hx pups by 54 h after Hx (P = 0.0005), and Northern analysis on day 15 showed a significant decrease in liver messenger RNA (mRNA) for IGF-II. Analysis of the major IGF binding proteins (BPs) was performed by Western ligand blots. Hx performed on day 6 resulted in a linear decrease in the amount of the 22k BP from day 10 to day 30. In contrast, the major neonatal BP (IGFBP-2, a 29.5k molecule) showed a biphasic response to neonatal Hx. On postnatal day 10, 4 days after Hx, a significant decrease in IGFBP-2 occurred, which persisted through day 15; by postnatal day 20 and continuing through postnatal day 30, the amount of IGFBP-2 in the serum dramatically increased. The 40 to 50k fraction of IGFBP-3 first appeared in significant quantities by postnatal day 20, and after Hx dropped to 10% of sham-control values. Similarly, Northern analysis on day 15 demonstrated a significant decrease in liver, but not brain, mRNA for IGFBP-2 after Hx, whereas on postnatal day 25, liver mRNA for IGFBP-2 was increased in Hx pups compared with sham controls. We conclude that the pituitary gland exerts significant but selective effects on neonatal growth, with the notable exception of brain growth. Serum levels of both IGF-I and IGF-II, as well as their BPs, are pituitary dependent in the neonatal period. Pituitary-dependent neonatal growth thus appears to be mediated by IGF and modulated by IGF-binding proteins. On the other hand, that portion of the persistent growth in the neonatal Hx rat that is independent of the pituitary-IGF axis may be a good model for investigation of fetal growth.\r"

HX rats were supplemented daily with 3% sucrose water, T4, and corticosterone. Rats received vehicle or human PTH-(1-34) at 8 micrograms/100 g, sc, once daily, alone or in combination with rat or ovine GH at 0.2 mg/100 g, sc, twice daily or 12 micrograms ovine GH/100 g.day by continuous sc infusion. After 12 days, rats were sedated, and blood, femurs, and tibias were removed. Femur trabecular and cortical bone calcium (Ca), dry weight (DW), and hydroxyproline were measured. PTH increased bone Ca, DW, and hydroxyproline in shams by approximately 30%, but consistently failed to induce an anabolic response in HX rats. GH alone stimulated systemic growth in HX rats and increased their bone Ca and DW by 2-fold. The anabolic effect of PTH was restored in HX rats given both PTH and GH. Total bone mass in these rats was approximately 20% more (P less than 0.05) than the bone mass of rats given GH alone. When food was restricted in shams to limit systemic growth, PTH still induced an increase in bone mass. We conclude that GH or GH-dependent factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-I, which increases in PTH-treated bones in vitro, are required for the anabolic response of bone to PTH in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Although it has been demonstrated that glucocorticoids can inhibit basal and stimulus-induced increase in fetal plasma ACTH concentrations, the site(s) of action of the glucocorticoids in the fetal hypothalamo-pituitary axis are unclear. We have investigated the ontogeny of the negative feedback effect of cortisol on basal and CRF-stimulated ACTH secretion in intact fetal sheep and in fetal sheep after surgical disconnection of the hypothalamus and pituitary (HPD). In saline-pretreated fetal sheep there was a significant increase in plasma ACTH concentrations in response to an ovine CRF (oCRF) bolus (1 microgram) in HPD and intact fetuses at 120-128 days and at 138-149 days gestation. In the intact group the ACTH response at 120-240 min after oCRF was significantly lower (P less than 0.01) after 138 days compared with before 128 days. In this group the cortisol response during the first hour after oCRF was significantly greater (P less than 0.005) after 138 days than in the younger fetuses. In the HPD group there was no significant difference between the two gestational age ranges in either the ACTH or cortisol responses to oCRF. Between 120 and 128 days gestation, increasing plasma cortisol concentrations (110-170 nmol/liter above baseline values) by exogenous infusion had no significant effect on the basal fetal plasma ACTH concentrations in HPD or in intact fetuses. In contrast, after 138 days gestation, the basal plasma ACTH concentrations were significantly decreased by 50% during the cortisol infusion period in the intact but not in the HPD group. It would appear therefore, that the development of the negative feedback action of cortisol to suppress basal fetal plasma concentrations of ACTH is dependent on the presence of a functional fetal hypothalamus. In HPD and intact fetuses cortisol infusion abolished the fetal ACTH response to the oCRF bolus from as early as 120 days gestation. Thus the negative feedback action of cortisol on the CRF-induced increases in fetal plasma ACTH concentrations can occur directly at the fetal pituitary.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and serum albumin are decreased under conditions of chronic dietary protein limitation. To investigate the biochemical mechanism(s) involved in the regulation of IGF-I and serum albumin synthesis by dietary protein, we studied the effects of protein limitation on IGF-I and serum albumin gene expression in young growing rats maintained on isocaloric diets containing 20%, 12%, 8%, or 4% protein. Animals maintained on the 12%, 8%, or 4% protein diets exhibited slight, moderate, or severe growth deficiency, respectively, and a decreased abundance of hepatic IGF-I messenger RNA (mRNA). The decrease in IGF-I mRNA was most pronounced for the largest [7.7 kilobase (kb)] species, which was decreased by 87% in animals maintained on the 4% protein diet compared with animals on the 20% protein diet. The 0.9 kb species of IGF-I mRNA exhibited a smaller (46%) reduction in abundance in animals maintained on the 4% protein diet. The differential regulation of the 7.7 kb IGF-I mRNA species compared with the shorter IGF-I mRNA species suggests that a sequence or sequences within the long 3'-untranslated region of this mRNA species may play a role in regulating its abundance under conditions of protein limitation. Serum albumin mRNA was also decreased (by 62%) in the animals maintained on the 4% protein diet. The level of serum albumin gene transcription was not decreased in animals on the low protein diets, suggesting that nutrition regulates albumin mRNA at a posttranscriptional step. There was considerable animal-to-animal variability in the level of IGF-I gene transcription within each dietary group. The mean level of IGF-I gene transcription was decreased by 46% in the animals on the 4% protein diet compared with animals on the 20% protein diet, although this decrease was not statistically significant because of the animal-to-animal variability in IGF-I gene transcription within the dietary groups. Additional studies of brain RNA from animals on the four diets indicated that brain IGF-II mRNA was decreased by 57% in animals on the 4% protein diet. It has been demonstrated recently that expression of the gene for IGF binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) is strongly induced in the liver of fasting animals. To investigate the possible regulation of the IGFBP-2 gene in the protein-limited animals, the abundance of liver and brain IGFBP-2 mRNA was analyzed in animals on the four diets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90382336\r", 
  ".W": "In FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, hydrocortisone alters two TSH-increased cAMP-mediated activities in an opposite manner. Thus, in a concentration-dependent fashion, hydrocortisone synergistically enhances TSH-increased thymidine incorporation into DNA, whereas it inhibits TSH-induced iodide uptake. The effect of hydrocortisone on TSH-increased thymidine incorporation is specific, in that it has only a minimal ability by itself to increase thymidine incorporation into DNA and slightly inhibits the activity of insulin or insulin-like growth factor-I. The effect of hydrocortisone on TSH-induced iodide uptake does not result from altered iodide efflux, but, rather, from a decrease in the maximal velocity, not the Km, of iodide influx, i.e. from a decrease in the effective number of iodide porters. The action of a cAMP analog to increase thymidine incorporation into DNA or iodide uptake was also increased or decreased, respectively, by hydrocortisone, whereas hydrocortisone did not diminish the ability of TSH to increase cAMP levels in the cells. The different effect of hydrocortisone on these two cAMP-mediated activities reflects, therefore, regulation of cAMP signal action rather than the ability of TSH to generate a cAMP signal. Twenty-four hours after TSH, actinomycin-D superinduces iodide uptake and abolishes the action of hydrocortisone to inhibit iodide uptake. It has been suggested that actinomycin-D superinduces iodide uptake in FRTL-5 cells by a posttranscriptional action, inhibition of mRNA degradation, rather than by its known transcriptional actions linked to DNA synthesis. More recent studies of the effect of actinomycin-D, given under identical circumstances, on TSH-stimulated malic enzyme mRNA levels directly validate this hypothesis. We, thus, suggest that the opposite action of hydrocortisone on the two cAMP-mediated activities may reflect positive and negative regulation of the action of cAMP at different steps in the transduction process, one being transcriptional (DNA synthesis) and the other posttranscriptional (induction of iodide porter activity).\r"

In the steroidogenic pathway, 17 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 (P-450(17) alpha) is a key enzyme controlling the formation of cortisol and androgens. Recently, we demonstrated that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) is a potent inhibitor of steroid production in ovine adrenocortical cells. In the present study we used a polyclonal antibody to P450(17) alpha to determine adrenal cell P-450(17) alpha enzyme content by Western analysis. In addition, we used a cDNA probe encoding for bovine P-450(17) alpha mRNA to determine levels of P-450(17) alpha mRNA in sheep ovarian adrenocortical cells in primary culture. When cells were cultured in a serum-free medium in the presence of ACTH for 48 h, P-450(17) alpha activity, enzyme content, and mRNA levels for P-450(17) alpha increased by 3- to more than 10-fold. TGF beta decreased the basal level and completely blocked the stimulatory action of ACTH on P-450(17) alpha enzyme activity. The effects of TGF beta on P-450(17) alpha enzyme content and mRNA levels were manifested in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal inhibition observed using 1 ng/ml TGF beta. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of TGF beta on P-450(17) alpha were not overcome by (Bu)2cAMP. These findings indicate that TGF beta is a potent negative regulator of P-450, and the inhibitory action appears to be at the level of P-450(17) alpha gene expression. The ability of TGF beta to suppress the positive stimulatory action of ACTH suggests that TGF beta could play a role in determining the pathway of steroidogenesis and, thereby, the specific steroids secreted by adrenocortical cells.\r"

  ".W": "Glandular kallikrein (GK) is a trypsin-like serine protease characterized by an ability to generate bioactive peptides from inactive precursors with high specificity. In rat pituitary lactotrophs, GK is an estrogen-induced dopamine-repressed protein which is coregulated with PRL and is localized in organelles associated with precursor processing, suggesting a function to process PRL to novel forms with unique biological activities. To investigate this hypothesis we studied the ability of GK to cleave PRL in vitro and also examined rat pituitary extracts for processed forms of PRL using Western blot analysis. GK did not cleave rat PRL under routine incubation conditions. However, GK converted PRL from a 25K form to a 22K form (by gel electrophoresis) in the presence of thiols (dithiothreitol or mercaptoethanol) and Triton X-100. These reagents appear to elicit proteolysis by altering PRL's conformation; thiols were essential for proteolysis and Triton X-100 enhanced the thiol effects. Sequencing of processed PRL revealed 3 cleavage sites: Arg174-Arg175,Lys185-Phe186, and Arg188-Cys189. The cleavage sites are clustered close to the C-terminus on a 16-amino acid domain bracketed by cysteine residues. The cleavage sites in PRL resemble those of other GK substrates in their structural features and are in a highly conserved domain of PRL. Western blot analysis of rat pituitary extracts using antiserum against rat PRL revealed 22K PRL variants that were highly estrogen dependent and whose levels were markedly increased by in vivo administration of cysteamine, a biological thiol known to alter pituitary PRL conformation in vivo. The 22K PRL variants comigrated with PRL bands generated by sequential in vitro processing with GK and carboxypeptidase-B. The present findings support the hypothesis that GK may function to process PRL to novel forms in rat lactotrophs.\r"

The N-terminal amino acid sequence (37 residues) of hamster CBG was determined and compared with published cDNA-deduced sequence information for rat and human CBG. Hamster CBG showed considerable sequence homology with both rat (70%) and human (59%) CBG. Because of the high level of homology, we were able to use a cRNA prepared from a rat CBG cDNA as a probe in Northern blot and solution hybridization analyses. Northern blots of hamster and rat liver RNA extracts revealed that the rat CBG cDNA probe hybridized to RNAs that were the same size in rats and hamsters. Further, the Northern blot showed that pregnant hamster liver contained substantially more CBG mRNA than nonpregnant hamster liver. The relative amounts of CBG mRNA in pregnant and nonpregnant hamster livers were compared using a solution hybridization assay. Slope-ratio analysis of the hybridization data revealed that pregnant hamster liver (day 14) contained 40-fold more CBG mRNA than nonpregnant hamster liver. When other tissues (kidney, spleen, small intestine, and decidual tissue) were assayed for CBG mRNA, a small amount of hybridization was detected by solution hybridization. However, Northern blot analysis of RNA extracts from nonhepatic tissues showed that the hybridizable sequences did not migrate at the same position as mature CBG mRNA. These results indicate that the observed increase in serum CBG during hamster pregnancy is largely attributable to an increase in hepatic CBG mRNA.\r"

Chondrocytes were isolated from the growth plates from the long bones of 3- to 5-week-old chicks. Conditioned medium was harvested from short term monolayer cultures for the assay of TGF beta production by these cells. A receptor competition assay using [125I]TGF beta was used to quantitate the amount of TGF beta in the conditioned medium. Acid-activated conditioned medium contained 5.0 +/- 0.4 ng/ml TGF beta, while conditioned medium that had not been exposed to acid had undetectable levels of the peptide by this assay. The initial cell plating density was inversely related to the amount of TGF beta produced on a per cell basis. Growth plate chondrocytes separated by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation into maturationally distinct subpopulations had different rates of TGF beta production; hypertropic chondrocytes produced significantly more TGF beta (4.5 ng/10(6) cells) than the smallest chondrocytes isolated (2.3 ng/10(6) cells). A variety of other growth mediators were tested for their ability to influence TGF beta production by chondrocytes, and it was found that only basic fibroblast growth factor could significantly influence TGF beta production, producing a 6-fold increase in TGF beta recovered in the conditioned medium. The production of TGF beta by growth plate chondrocytes implicates it as an important autocrine or paracrine regulator in the process of endochondral calcification.\r"

In primary cultures of dispersed normal female rat anterior pituitary cells the interactions of dopamine and neurotensin were examined with reference to the rate of PRL release, the magnitude of 45Ca2+ uptake, the rate of fractional 45Ca2+ efflux, and the dynamic response of the intracellular calcium concentration (Cai) monitored with the fluorescent dye, Indo-1. Neurotensin stimulated calcium uptake and also mobilized a pool of intracellular calcium to increase Cai in a sustained plateau-like pattern. The response of PRL release and fractional efflux to neurotensin, however, each displayed typical spike and plateau profiles. In the presence of dopamine the stimulation of PRL release and calcium uptake due to neurotensin were abolished, and the rise in Cai was barely detectable, but neurotensin-stimulated fractional efflux persisted almost unchanged. These data suggest that dopamine may modulate Cai by inhibiting calcium uptake and possibly also by enhancing cellular calcium extrusion under stimulated conditions. Further, the increased inositol trisphosphate production reportedly stimulated by neurotensin apparently does not generate a spike-like response of intracellular calcium, and stimulated hormone release may display a spike and plateau pattern solely with a plateau Cai profile.\r"

  ".U": "90382348\r", 
  ".W": "An in vitro bioassay for steroidogenesis-stimulating activity (SSA) in charcoal-extracted rat testicular interstitial fluid (IF) was developed. The bioassay was based upon stimulation of testosterone production by Percoll gradient-purified adult rat Leydig cells during a 20 h incubation in the presence of a maximally stimulating dose of human CG (hCG). The hCG-stimulated conditions were employed to avoid assay interference by endogenous LH in the sample preparations. The standard preparation (a pool of IF from normal adult rats) stimulated testosterone production 3- to 4-fold above that obtained with a maximal dose of either hCG or LH alone, and a linear log dose-testosterone response was observed over the range from 150% to 300% of hCG-stimulated testosterone production. The bioassay had a mean index of precision (lambda) of 0.13 (n = 10 assays), a between assay variation of 10.7-11.7%, and a useful working range from 4.9-28 microliters IF including at least three serial half-dilutions. Parallelism with the IF standard was obtained with IF collected from aged (greater than 15 months old) rats, adult rats made bilaterally cryptorchid for either 4 weeks or 12 months, or injected 6 h previously with 100 IU hCG, and with ovine testicular lymph. Testicular SSA was not affected by coincubation with rat LH antiserum and was not attributable to prevention of oxygen-mediated enzyme damage during the incubation period. Although charcoal-extracted rat serum log dose-response relationships were nonparallel with the standard, serum displayed an apparent relative bioactivity of approximately 20% that of normal IF based on ED50 comparisons. The activity of testicular IF was not affected by coincubation with serum. Untreated and charcoal-extracted rat albumin, at an assay concentration equivalent to that present in normal rat serum or IF, caused only a minor stimulation of testosterone production. Charcoal-extracted bovine albumin, ovalbumin, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, bovine 31 kDa inhibin, and transforming growth factor-beta were inactive. Activity was nondetectable in rat thoracic duct lymph or high speed supernatants of adult rat testicular extracts. Testicular SSA and serum from normal rats displayed slightly different time-courses of action, with SSA active during both acute (1.0 h) and longer term (2.0-20 h) incubations, while serum stimulated testosterone production only in the longer term incubations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The effects of decidualization on uterine expression of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) have been examined in the hypophysectomized-ovariectomized (hypox-ovx) rat and the pituitary-intact (ovx) rat. Decidualization was induced by uterine stimulation of animals treated with a combination of 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone. The patterns of change in uterine IGF-I mRNA and IGFBP-1 mRNA abundance were similar to hypox-ovx rats, hypox-ovx rats replaced with GH and T4, and ovx rats. The changes in IGF-I mRNA abundance were temporally related to 17 beta-estradiol injections. IGFBP-1 mRNA was undetectable early in the decidualization process and reached maximal levels on day 6. Mechanical separation of the deciduoma tissue from the underlying myometrium revealed that the deciduoma tissue was depleted in IGF-I mRNA, while the majority of the IGFBP-1 was located in the deciduoma tissue. The in situ hybridization technique was used to localize IGF-I and IGFBP-1 mRNA in the decidualized uterus. The majority of the IGF-I expression was localized to the outer stroma and smooth muscle cell layer, whereas IGFBP-1 mRNA was detected in uterine epithelial cells and stromal glands. These experiments demonstrated that uterine IGF-I and IGFBP-1 expression during the process of decidualization are pituitary independent. Furthermore, our observations support the hypothesis that the expression of IGFBP-1, a protein capable of inhibiting the mitogenic activity of IGF-I, in deciduoma tissue may inhibit paracrine IGF-1 actin and allow for the differentiation of stromal tissue.\r"

Testosterone increased total acid phosphatase activity approximately 2-fold in epithelial cell cultures. This increase occurred only after the cessation of cell proliferation (i.e. upon reaching a confluent monolayer). In contrast, stromal cells showed no significant change in total acid phosphatase activity in response to androgen. Polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing of total acid phosphatase activity from epithelial and stromal cell extracts revealed that secretory acid phosphatase activity was localized exclusively in the epithelial cells while lysosomal acid phosphatase activity was present in both cell types. Furthermore, the androgen-induced increases in epithelial total acid phosphatase activity were found to result from increases in the secretory isoform.\r"

Superimposed on this change in blood pressure (BP) was a profound bradycardia characterized by a rate about half that recorded before stimulation. Changes in heart rate (HR) and BP observed during amygdaloid kindled seizures were similar to those observed during secondary spontaneous seizures. These effects apparently are independent of the kindling stimulus because stimulus-induced cardiovascular changes were not present at the beginning of the kindling process. These results suggest that the kindling seizure model is useful to study the underlying mechanisms of seizure-induced cardiac arrhythmias and possibly the clinical phenomenon of sudden unexplained death in epileptic patients.\r"

The maximum anticonvulsant effect of DM (30 mg/kg) on fully kindled seizures appeared within 30 min of administration and lasted for at least 2 h. DM decreased, in a dose-dependent manner [10-70 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)], the severity of kindled seizures 30 min after injection, but the estimated ED50 was 3 times higher than the previously reported value for maximal electroshock convulsions. Furthermore, the high dose (70 mg/kg), while suppressing kindled seizures, produced myoclonus which coincided with EEG spike activity in the amygdala and the cortex. When tested on the development of kindling, 30 mg/kg DM retarded the growth of afterdischarge in the amygdala and the cortex, but had no effect on the development of behavioral seizures. DM 60 mg/kg accelerated development of kindling and produced spontaneous seizures. These results indicate that DM, unlike other NMDA antagonists, has a narrow therapeutic window as an anticonvulsant on kindled seizures and that higher doses may potentiate the kindling process.\r"

In animals, adenosine and adenosine analogues have anticonvulsant effects that may be due to interactions with central A1 adenosine receptors. CBZ (at therapeutically relevant concentrations) inhibits the binding of agonists and antagonists to brain A1 adenosine receptors, but whether as an agonist/antagonist is not clear. The adenosine agonist, N6-[3H]cyclohexyladenosine ([3H]CHA), binds to membranes from rat cortex and hippocampus at two nanomolar binding sites or states. To clarify the actions of carbamazepine at the A1 adenosine receptor, its inhibitory actions were compared with those of known adenosine agonists and xanthine antagonists using 0.1 nM[3H]CHA, in which almost all binding is to the higher affinity state, or 10 nM [3H]CHA, in which there is a substantial contribution of binding from both states. The ratios of the IC50 values (concentration that inhibits specific binding by 50%) at 10 nM [3H]CHA to the IC50 values at 0.1 nM [3H]CHA were 18-31 for the agonists and 4-10 for the xanthine antagonists. CBZ had a ratio of 3. The inhibitory effects of GTP on [3H]CHA binding were less in the presence of the adenosine agonist, 2-chloroadenosine than were inhibitory effects in the presence of the xanthine antagonist theophylline or CBZ in both cortex and hippocampus. These in vitro studies indicate that CBZ is an antagonist at A1 adenosine receptors in cerebral cortical and hippocampal membranes from rat brain. Agonist activity at A1 adenosine receptors would have been compatible with the sedative anticonvulsant effects of CBZ, but these data do not support a role of the anticonvulsant action of carbamazepine on A1 adenosine receptors in cerebral cortex or hippocampus.\r"

Localization of the epileptic area was obtained from the recording of three spontaneous seizures and from stimulation data including self-reported auras, seizures, and intracranial EEG afterdischarges recorded during an incremental stimulation sequence at all cortical pairs of contacts. Positive responses to stimulation were obtained in 63% of patients. Concordance between spontaneous and induced auras or seizures was greater than 90% with single unilateral foci and less with multiple foci. Stimulation data reliably predicted the resection area in unilateral and bilateral temporal foci but not in other locations. Afterdischarge thresholds were not reliable predictors of the spontaneous seizure focus. The intracranial stimulation procedure used appears to provide useful confirmatory and complementary localizing information in relation to that obtained from spontaneous seizures.\r"

In the preresection ECOG, MTH increased the frequency of spikes in 78%, the area of cortical spiking in 30% and induced seemingly \"new\" spike foci in 43%. Similar although less dramatic changes occurred in the final (i.e., postresection) ECOG. Whether these changes induced by MTH, specifically the new spike foci, are significant was assessed by correlating surgical results with the presence of \"residual spikes\" (i.e., after all resections, not spontaneously occurring but activated by MTH). Surprisingly, nine patients with residual \"MTH-spikes\" did not have any postoperative seizures whereas two had some. This raises the question of whether MTH effects are significant overall. Caution is advised in the use of MTH in intraoperative assessment of interictal spike fields, especially when new spike foci are activated. Further study of the possibility of false activation, with a larger series, is advised.\r"

During prolonged video-EEG monitoring, two patients had a convulsive seizure after a typical NPD episode and on these occasions EEG showed epileptiform discharge. In the three patients, attacks occurred repeatedly with different intensity, representing \"fragments\" of the same seizure. These fragments of the attack could occur periodically every 20-40 s. We postulate that short NPD attacks are actually epileptic seizures originating from the frontal lobes. The rhythmicity of the episodes may be due to rhythmic oscillation of cortical function during non-REM sleep.\r"

Case 3 has shown only febrile seizures. Any association between the excess of genetic material and the EEG trait \"generalized SW\" might not be a chance occurrence in this disorder; however, both EEG findings and clinical features (seizure type and frequency) in the 23 cases reported in the literature are too scanty to allow confirmation of such an association.\r"

  ".W": "From the medical records of 238 intensive care unit (ICU) patients who had infections with gram-negative pathogens commonly associated with serious illness, we developed a predictive score of clinical risk factors for seizures. To evaluate the predictive ability of this score, we applied it to a separate population of 645 seriously ill hospitalized patients with similar gram-negative infections who were in antibiotic clinical trials. The patients at highest risk were classified into one of the following three categories: (a) patients with major central nervous system (CNS) insults (CNS surgery, hemorrhage, infection, or other lesion within 1 month before hospital admission or any history of CNS neoplasia), (b) patients with a predisposing factor (renal impairment or a history of seizures) plus a precipitating factor (anoxic encephalopathy/coma or an acute hypotensive episode), and (c) patients with both renal impairment and a history of seizures. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated in each of the two populations. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) represents the probability that the score would rank a randomly chosen patient who subsequently had a seizure as having had a greater prior level of seizure risk than a randomly chosen patient who did not experience a seizure. The AUC was 0.87 (SE = 0.05) for the original population used to develop the score and 0.81 (SE = 0.04) for the population used for the validation study. The clinical risk score, based on readily available information, provides a useful means to identify among seriously ill infectious disease service patients, those who are at highest risk for seizures. It also serves as a baseline for evaluating the non-drug-related risk factors for seizures in patients treated with antibiotics.\r"

Twelve healthy male volunteers received PHT sodium (250 mg/5 ml; 229.95 mg free acid) and ACC-9653 (375 mg/5 ml; 232.87 mg free acid) i.v. in 30 min in a randomized, double-blind cross-over fashion.

The PHT area under the curve (AUC) was not statistically different between treatments; the bioavailability of PHT after ACC-9653 was 99 +/- 11%. The fraction of unbound converted PHT at the end of the prodrug infusion, in the presence of 44 micrograms/ml ACC-9653, was significantly higher than at 180 min, when the concentration of ACC-9653 was 0.1 microgram/ml. ACC-9653 was shown to be a bioequivalent PHT prodrug exhibiting less irritation at the injection site than the current marketed PHT.\r"

Twenty-three studies were performed; 10 patients had ascites. Liver function was assessed from the plasma elimination rates of antipyrine, caffeine and stable isotopes of cholic acid, the latter administered both orally [2,2,4,4-2H] and intravenously [24-13C]. Portosystemic shunt fraction was calculated as the ratio of the intravenous and oral clearances of the isotopes of cholic acid. Portosystemic shunt fraction was similar in patients with and without ascites (61% +/- 16% vs. 64% +/- 11%) and unrelated to urinary sodium excretion in patients with ascites (r = -0.145). Patients with ascites had significantly lower elimination rates of all administered compounds as compared with patients without ascites (antipyrine = 0.012 +/- 0.007 vs. 0.031 +/- 0.016/hr, p less than 0.001; caffeine = 0.014 +/- 0.013 vs. 0.061 +/- 0.041/hr, p less than 0.002; intravenous cholic acid = 1.355 +/- 0.442 vs. 2.284 +/- 0.885/hr, p = 0.005; orally administered cholic acid = 2.178 +/- 0.841 vs. 4.056 +/- 1.837/hr, p = 0.007). However, urinary sodium excretion in patients with ascites was not related to the elimination constants of these compounds (r = 0.360, 0.319, 0.067, -0.073, respectively). Ascites complicating alcoholic liver disease is associated with impaired liver function but not the extent of portosystemic shunting.\r"

In study I, gastric mucosal blood flow, measured by hydrogen gas clearance, and acid output were determined in basal conditions and after the administration of propranolol (0.3 mg/kg/min) or vehicle infusion in portal hypertensive and sham-operated rats. Gastric mucosal blood flow was significantly higher (p less than 0.005) in portal hypertensive rats than in sham-operated rats, and it was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) after propranolol infusion in portal hypertensive rats (39 +/- 2 vs. 35 +/- 3 ml/min/100 gm). Basal acid output was not significantly modified with propranolol infusion, either in portal hypertensive or sham-operated animals. In study II, acid output was measured in portal hypertensive rats in basal conditions, during pentagastrin (20 micrograms/kg/hr) infusion and after the combined infusion of pentagastrin and propranolol (or vehicle). Pentagastrin infusion significantly increased (p less than 0.001) acid output, but propranolol did not modify stimulated gastric acid secretion. In conclusion, propranolol induced a slight but significant reduction in gastric mucosal blood flow and did not change basal or stimulated gastric acid secretion.\r"

To elucidate the role of beta-adrenergic receptor alteration in this phenomenon, we measured heart rate responsiveness to isoprenaline and myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor-binding characteristics in three groups of rats: those that were sham operated, those that had portal vein stenosis and those that were cirrhotic because of bile duct ligation. Responsiveness to isoprenaline was evaluated in conscious rats by the dose of isoprenaline needed to increase basal heart rate by 50 beats/min and by the maximal heart rate response. beta-Receptor characteristics in heart membranes were derived from 125I-iodocyanopindolol binding data. Compared with sham-operated controls, cirrhotic rats needed a significantly higher dose of isoprenaline to raise basal heart rate by 50 beats/min (102.3 +/- 19.1 vs. 28.3 +/- 11.3 ng/kg) and lower maximal heart rate response (104 +/- 29 vs. 158 +/- 61 beats/min). In addition, myocardial beta-receptor density was significantly lower in cirrhotic rats (26.5 +/- 4.6 vs. 37.5 +/- 10.3 fmol/mg protein) and the dissociation constant was higher (31.6 +/- 17.0 vs. 14.0 +/- 2.5 pmol/L). Analysis of beta 1/beta 2 subpopulations revealed that the decreased total beta-receptor density was entirely due to selective beta 1-receptor down-regulation. beta-Receptor affinity for agonist was not altered in cirrhotic rats. Rats with portal vein stenosis showed no significant differences in either isoprenaline responsiveness or beta-receptor characteristics when compared with controls. These results indicate that beta-adrenergic receptor down-regulation may be responsible for the myocardial hyporesponsiveness to catecholamines observed in cirrhosis.\r"

Hepatocytes were obtained by collagenase perfusion of healthy human liver tissue and were treated with glycochenodeoxycholate for 24 hr 1 day after plating. Clear signs of cytotoxicity were observed at concentrations of about 100 mumol/L glycochenodeoxycholate. Toxicity was determined by release of alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, AST, ALT or lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium, by measuring DNA synthesis of the cultured liver cells and by testing the viability of the hepatocytes using trypan-blue dye exclusion. Addition of ursodeoxycholate, which by itself proved to be of little toxicity, significantly reduced the hepatotoxic effects of glycochenodeoxycholate: 72% +/- 6% of the cells survived treatment with 500 mumol/L glycochenodeoxycholate alone, but addition of 100 mumol/L ursodeoxycholate increased the survival rate to 87% +/- 4% (p less than 0.05). Moreover, all enzymes tested were secreted at a significantly lower level when ursodeoxycholate was present. Similarly, the cellular DNA synthesis was maintained at significantly higher levels as a result of ursodeoxycholate treatment. We conclude that (a) primary human hepatocytes are a suitable model for studying hepatotoxicity of bile salts in vitro, (b) ursodeoxycholate reduces hepatotoxicity of other bile salts and (c) ursodeoxycholate can act hepatoprotectively by itself (i.e., alteration of the metabolism of other bile salts is not necessarily required).\r"

The changes in serum and urinary bile acids induced by ursodeoxycholic acid treatment were studied. After 29 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (750 to 1,000 mg/day) for 6 to 12 mo because of an increase in ursodeoxycholic acid, total plasma bile acids increased from 30.5 +/- 6 mumol/L (mean +/- S.E.M.) to 52.7 +/- 11.7 mumol/L (p less than 0.01). The increase in total plasma bile acids correlated significantly with concentrations of plasma bile acid before treatment (p less than 0.01). The concentrations of endogenous bile acids decreased, mainly because of a decrease of cholic acid. During treatment, glycine conjugation increased and taurine conjugation decreased, whereas sulfation and glucuronidation of bile acids were unchanged. In 10 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis in stages III and IV, urinary excretion of bile acids was also studied. After treatment, ursodeoxycholic acid and its 3-beta isomer and C-1-hydroxylated and C-6-hydroxylated derivatives were also excreted. During treatment, urinary excretion of endogenous bile acids decreased. The increase of ursodeoxycholic acid and the decrease of endogenous bile acids may both be related to the improvement of biochemical liver tests in precirrhotic stages of the disease. In cirrhosis, endogenous bile acids in plasma remained high and changes in liver tests were small.\r"

Our studies of isolated perfused rat liver previously demonstrated saturable uptake of nontransferrin-bound iron that continues despite hepatic iron overload. To further characterize the mechanism of transport of this form of iron, we measured binding of 55Fe-labeled ferrous ascorbate to rat liver plasma membrane vesicles under varying conditions. Binding of 5 mumol/L iron by both basolateral and canalicular membranes was time-dependent and linear for the first 5 sec. Initial rate of binding of ferrous ascorbate to basolateral membrane vesicles was temperature dependent and increased by calcium but, in contrast to the perfused rat liver, was not inhibited by other divalent cations. Binding velocities by basolateral membrane vesicles were saturable at increasing iron concentration (Km = 33 mumol/L, Vmax = 16 pmol/mg protein/sec). Ferrous iron binding by canalicular membrane vesicles was also temperature dependent, but initial association rates were not saturable over the concentration range studied (2 to 20 mumol/L). We conclude that nontransferrin-bound iron associates with basolateral liver plasma membrane vesicles by a saturable mechanism sensitive to temperature and calcium and consistent with a membrane carrier. Other divalent cations do not inhibit membrane association but may compete for a subsequent cytosolic binding site.\r"

The epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA, quantified by solution hybridization, decreased after partial hepatectomy, with a nadir of about 35% 18 hr after hepatectomy. An even stronger decrease in the number of epidermal growth factor binding sites after partial hepatectomy was observed in a Golgi-enriched low-density membrane fraction, reflecting available newly synthesized epidermal growth factor receptors. It is suggested that this decrease in newly synthesized available epidermal growth factor receptors is caused primarily, but not entirely, by decreased epidermal growth factor receptor mRNA levels and the additional down-regulation of epidermal growth factor binding sites may involve posttranslational mechanisms such as intracellular occupation by transforming growth factor-alpha. The observation that the number of specific epidermal growth factor binding sites after partial hepatectomy was only moderately reduced in prelysosomal endosomes and in lysosomes, compared with the newly synthesized receptors, may indicate that a pool of receptors targeted for lysosomes exists and these receptors are regulated in a different manner than the receptor pool targeted for the cell surface. Furthermore, at least two separable endocytic subcompartments are involved in the transport of the epidermal growth factor/epidermal growth factor receptor complex in the liver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum putrescine levels were variably increased after partial hepatectomy and did not correlate with hepatic regenerative activity. Serum spermidine levels remained unaltered and spermine levels were undetectable both before and after partial hepatectomy. In hepatic tissue, only putrescine concentrations increased in proportion to the extent of hepatic resection. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between hepatic putrescine concentrations and restitution of liver mass (r = 0.778), DNA synthesis (r = 0.8026) and protein synthesis (r = 0.7034) (p less than 0.05). No significant correlations existed between hepatic spermidine or spermine concentrations and these parameters of hepatic regeneration.

Animals with portacaval shunts were smaller than those without shunts. Moreover, they had reduced serum levels of testosterone and estradiol. The reduction in serum testosterone was greater than that of estradiol. As a result, the calculated estrogen/testosterone ratio of the two groups of animals was greater for the portacaval shunt animals than for the controls. The dissociation constant values for the androgen receptor and estrogen receptor in the liver did not differ between groups. The activity of the androgen receptor (p less than 0.01) and estrogen receptor (p less than 0.05) was reduced markedly in the animals with portacaval shunts compared with controls. Moreover, the hepatic cytosolic estrogen receptor activity--but not that of the androgen receptor--correlated with the measured hepatic mass in both groups of animals.

  ".W": "Orthotopic liver transplantation may be associated during the postoperative period with hepatic artery thrombosis, a catastrophic occurrence generally necessitating emergency retransplantation. To assess the contribution of the coagulation mechanism to this complication, the levels of procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins were followed in 41 liver transplant patients during the first 10 postoperative days. The mean activities of all procoagulant factors reach normal values on day 1 except for factors V and VII, which achieve normal activity by day 3. Supernormal levels of factor VIII activity and antigen are noted (peak values on day 5 of 334% +/- 113% and 481% +/- 260%, respectively). The anticoagulant proteins show delayed recovery, with deficient antithrombin III levels seen in 81% of patients on day 3 and 57% on day 5. Similarly, proteins C and S are subnormal in 24% and 21%, respectively on day 3, and 20% and 10%, respectively, on day 5. During this period, elevated levels of thrombin/antithrombin complexes are encountered, reflecting in vivo activation of the coagulation mechanism. Activated thrombin is, therefore, being generated at a time when a decrease in the major regulatory anticoagulant proteins exists. These data suggest an imbalance between the hemostatic and thrombotic mechanisms and indicate a sustained prothrombotic state that may contribute to the risk for hepatic artery thrombosis. Using a regimen of low-dose heparin and fresh frozen plasma infusion, no thromboses have been seen in 65 consecutive liver transplants.\r"

  ".W": "Lidocaine, an aminoethylamide, undergoes deethylation in the liver after intravenous injection, resulting in the formation of monoethylglycinexylidide. Serum monoethylglycinexylidide concentration can be measured by a simple, rapid fluorescent polarization immunoassay. We sought to determine whether lidocaine metabolism, as indicated by monoethylglycinexylidide formation, could be used as a quantitative index of hepatic function. Therefore we measured monoethylglycinexylidide formation in 10 healthy children and in 28 children with chronic liver disease. Patients with chronic liver disease were divided by disease severity as being at low, moderate or high risk for deterioration based on a clinical scoring system for liver transplant candidates. In healthy controls, the peak monoethylglycinexylidide concentration 15 min after injection of lidocaine (1 mg/kg) was 97 +/- 12 micrograms/L (mean +/- S.E.). However, monoethylglycinexylidide concentration was decreased in 28 children with chronic liver disease (32 +/- 5 micrograms/L, p less than 0.001). Furthermore, this value was inversely proportional to the severity of liver disease. The mean difference in monoethylglycinexylidide concentration between the low-risk and high-risk groups was statistically significant (42 +/- 6 vs. 11 +/- 4 micrograms/L, respectively, p less than 0.01). We conclude that the rate of formation of the lidocaine metabolite monoethylglycinexylidide is decreased in patients with chronic liver disease and is inversely related to disease severity. Therefore measurement of monoethylglycinexylidide concentration after lidocaine injection may be used as a quantitative assessment of liver function in children. We speculate that monoethylglycinexylidide formation may be a useful prognostic index in children with liver disease.\r"

During 1 yr, 110 French patients were admitted to Hopital Beaujon for chronic hepatitis B. Fourteen were found to have hepatitis B virus reactivation; of these, three were anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1-positive. These 14 patients were HBsAg-positive for 60 mo (range = 6 to 180 mo). Clinical manifestations related to reappearance of hepatitis B virus DNA were present in 11 patients. HBeAg/anti-HBe status did not change in nine patients in whom hepatitis B virus reactivation would not have been recognized without hepatitis B virus DNA testing. Cirrhosis was present in nine patients. Four patients, of whom two were anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1-positive, had fulminant liver failure. Two patients died; one was anti-human immunodeficiency virus-1-positive. One patient was given an emergency transplant.\r"

The patients studied included 43 patients with nonalcoholic chronic liver disease, 21 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 48 control patients with other hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal diseases. To confirm the specificity of the intrahepatic hepatitis B virus DNA signal and to understand the structure of the integrated viral sequences, molecular cloning and DNA sequencing of an integrated hepatitis B virus DNA were done in one patient. Among 13 patients without serological evidence of previous hepatitis B virus infection, no hepatitis B virus sequences were found in the liver. In other HBsAg-negative patients with evidence of previous hepatitis B virus exposure, a substantial positive rate of intrahepatic hepatitis B virus DNA was found (7%). The intrahepatic hepatitis B virus DNA was all in integrated form. The positive rate among patients with nonalcoholic chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis (2%) was not different from that of the control group with other hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal diseases (4%). However, the positive rate of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA between hepatocellular carcinoma patients and nonhepatocellular carcinoma patients was statistically significant (19% vs. 3%, p less than 0.05). Molecular cloning and sequencing of a 3.0 kb EcoRI fragment of an integrated hepatitis B virus DNA from an anti-HBs-positive patient revealed that it was a partial copy of the hepatitis B virus genome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Replicative forms of hepatitis B virus DNA were detected in the neoplastic and nonneoplastic liver tissues from 34% and 62% of 29 HBsAg-positive patients and 0% and 20% of five HBsAg-negative patients by Southern blot hybridization analysis. Of the 10 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection in whom hepatocellular carcinoma developed during follow-up, hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B virus DNA were detected in the sera of seven and eight patients, respectively, at presentation, 13 to 43 mo before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In nine patients, hepatitis B virus DNA was persistently or intermittently detected in the serum during follow-up. Five patients remained hepatitis B e antigen-positive and seven were detectable for hepatitis B virus DNA in serum when hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed. Four patients had one or more episodes of exacerbations before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma; in three, the exacerbations were associated with changes in level of hepatitis B virus replication. Our study demonstrated that despite the long interval between the onset of hepatitis B virus infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis B virus replication persisted in most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, albeit at a low level.\r"

Lack of applicability is the main reason community hospitals have been slow to use health services research generated at teaching hospitals, say experts. Now, that is changing. Executives are finding that the exacting work required to design tailored clinical appropriateness studies for their institution results in improved physician relations and better patient care. \"Almost consistently we find that physicians who practice at the high end respond [to this feedback] by altering their practice patterns and cutting the rate at which they perform a particular service or procedure,\" says Robert Keller, M.D., executive director of the Maine Medical Assessment Foundation.\r"

The longest reported survival on haemodialysis of a patient with primary hyperoxaluria is eight and a half years. We report a patient who survived for eleven years on haemodialysis after reaching ESRF due to primary hyperoxaluria, and suggest that this prolonged survival was due to relatively mild disease severity rather than exceptional treatment.\r"

The original procedure featured the preliminary washing of the dialysis circuit with heparin, which was then recirculated and eliminated, and the two drugs, heparin and defibrotide, are known to interact with each other. The purpose of this present study was to explore the ex-vivo heparin activity (assessed as anti-Xa activity) in diverse hemodialysis models using defibrotide (800 mg intravenous, in 4 bolus injections) and various dosages of heparin. Anti-Xa activity is negligible in dialysis conducted with defibrotide alone. When the circuit was prewashed with heparin (5000 and 2500 IU), there was evident anti-Xa activity (0.3-0.5 U/ml) in the first 30-60 minutes of dialysis; continuous heparin infusion (500 U/hour) resulted in high anti-Xa activity levels at the end of dialysis. Thus the best hemodialysis procedure for patients at high risk of bleeding should be one utilizing only defibrotide, or defibrotide plus small amounts of calcium heparin infused at the rate of 500 U/hour for not more than two hours.\r"

On polyamide and polypropylene membranes a sufficient cell seeding was possible. Coating with collagen or fibronectin improves the attachment and spreading on all membranes. Differences between collagen and fibronectin were detected, observing the morphology of the cells: on collagen, most of the cells spread, whilst on fibronectin, most of the cells spread and flattened polygonally. If the adhesion of hepatocytes prolongs their metabolic function, a large adhesion surface in bioreactors is necessary. To reach a high surface area for cell adhesion in bioreactors one possibility is the use of polyamide and polypropylene membranes.\r"

Ablative surgical procedures have been directed against either the trigeminal nerve or the nervus intermedius/greater superficial petrosal (NI/GSP) pathway. Both carry nociceptive impulses from the head and face, and the NI also carries parasympathetic fibres which appear to be responsible for the autonomic concomitants of cluster headache. Trigeminal operative procedures are not consistently helpful in chronic cluster headache, while NI section has been shown to give potentially long lasting relief but carries the potential risks of cerebellopontine angle surgery. In eight selected cases of chronic cluster headache we have demonstrated a high early success rate for pain relief, with few complications, in the performance of NI section, combined, when indicated, with microvascular decompression of the trigeminal main sensory root. We believe that cochlear nerve monitoring helps prevent postoperative hearing impairment. An intimate relationship between the NI and arterial loops of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) or the internal auditory artery has been frequently observed in our chronic cluster headache patients.\r"

Changes in the entire, uniformly metrically divided suprathreshold sensitivity range were measured. In 24 healthy volunteer subjects, pain was induced experimentally at 0200, 0600, 1000, 1400, 1800, and 2200 hours in the pericranial musculature. Blood circulation in both superficial temporal and occipital arteries was reduced by applying a cuff to the head pumping up to 200 mmHg during rhythmic chewing on a spring, thereby producing a continuously increasing bilateral, dull, frontal headache. The subjects rated the intensity continuously using a category sub-dividing procedure ranging from pain threshold to pain tolerance limit. At low levels of headache intensity there were no significant diurnal differences in pain sensitivity. Sensitivity to very intense headache, however, varied significantly over the course of the day: sensitivity was greatest at 0200 hours; it decreased at a constant rate until 1400 hours, and increased again continuously until 2200 hours (p less than or equal to .05). Also the findings showed significant effects of sex on the pain sensitivity of pericranial musculature for all pain intensities: women are approx. twice as sensitive as men (p less than or equal to 0.05). These results suggest that not only sex, but also time of day, must be taken into consideration in the clinical determination of pain sensitivity of pericranial musculature in the course of headache diagnostics.\r"

One hundred and eight persistent headache patients, referred for cognitive-behavioral management of their disorder, completed questionnaires designed to assess: distressing thoughts and feelings experienced during headache attacks, evaluation of the experienced pain, perceived influence of stress and worry on headaches, and capacity to verbally express emotions. The results showed that the intensity of head pain correlated with measures of headache-related distress and with the proportion of headache-related distress to situation-related distress. Duration of head pain was also associated with the proportion of headache-related distress to situation-related distress, and additionally with a tendency to deny the influence of stress and worry on headaches and with difficulty in expressing emotions. These findings were taken as support of our previously stated hypothesis that head pain of increased severity is associated with a cognitive shift whereby the patient's primary concern moves from situational and interpersonal distress to distress associated with the disorder itself. In addition, these findings point to affective distress and lack of emotional expressiveness as correlating differentially with the headache dimensions of intensity and duration.\r"

Our study population comprised 37 female migraine patients and 34 matched controls. Heart rate, skin conductance, pulse amplitude of the temporal artery and an EMG of the temporal muscle were registered during a baseline situation and during a mental stressor. In addition, state anxiety, trait anxiety, facilitating anxiety and stress tolerance were assessed. Migraine patients reported higher levels of trait anxiety, greater fear of failure, lower stress tolerance and higher levels of state anxiety than nonheadache controls. Physiological baseline levels and stress reactions did not differ between migraine patients and controls. Linear combinations of psychological and psychophysiological data sets did not show an acceptable degree of accuracy in the classification of individual response profiles into groups. Within the migraine group, 54% of the average duration of migraine attacks and 33% of the variation in average maximum headache intensity could be explained by a combination of psychological, psychophysiological and socio-demographic variables. It is concluded that measures from both the psychological and the physiological domain should be included when studying the effects of stress in migraine.\r"

Femoral artery, saphenous vein, and lateral saphenous lymphatic vessels were cannulated in an anesthetized dog. Baseline samples were collected, the hind paw was subjected to scald injury, and samples were collected serially for up to 6 hours after burn injury. Tissue fluid beneath the scald injury was harvested at the end of the experiments. In the absence of significant serologic evidence for inhibition, lymph and tissue fluid exhibited early and prolonged suppression of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation. We concluded that edema fluid capable of cell-mediated immune suppression forms early after thermal injury and that lymph generated from the site of burn injury is immunosuppressive.\r"

Prostaglandin E2 was released by KCs from burned guinea pigs at a consistently and significantly high level when stimulated with endotoxin. On postburn day 8, KCs that were cocultured with hepatocytes released significantly less PGE2. There was also a significant decrease in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity on postburn day 1. Kupffer cells can mediate immune suppression in burn injury by a prolonged increased production of PGE2 that has immunosuppressive effects on other cells and by a decreased cytotoxic effect soon after burn injury.\r"

Peripheral PMNs isolated from rats that received 10% or 30% body surface area full-thickness thermal injuries were quantitated and examined for functional alterations in membrane potential and cytosolic hydrogen peroxide production for 35 days after thermal injury. With 10% thermal injury, leukocytes increased quantitatively to experimental maximums that were 70% above normal on day 7 before a return to normal by day 28. Platelet levels showed a nonsignificant decrease for 2 days after thermal injury before increasing to levels 20% to 40% above normal through day 28. Phorbol myristate acetate-induced PMN membrane depolarization was inhibited as much as 30% for 21 days after 10% thermal injury. No changes in oxidative activity were apparent except for day 14, when hydrogen peroxide production was 40% above normal. With 30% thermal injury, leukocyte quantities were three to five times normal, with increased relative numbers of PMNs and decreased lymphocytes through day 28. Platelet levels decreased for 4 days before increasing to levels 30% to 47% above normal through day 21. Compared with 10% thermal injury, 30% thermal injury further reduced the ability of PMN membranes to depolarize through day 35. In addition, PMN hydrogen peroxide production was 30% lower on day 1 and increased thereafter to levels that were 40% above normal on day 21.\r"

Fifty percent of the patients with genital burns and 20% of the patients with perineal and/or buttock burns required skin grafting in the acute stage. No patient required suprapubic cystostomies, diverting colostomies, or local flap coverage of exposed testicles. Burn scar contractures were the most frequent complications. Thirty-two patients (56%) required contracture release of the perineum and coverage with either skin grafts or local skin flaps. In three patients (6%) contracture required release of the penis and scrotum. One patient lost a testicle. Three patients developed rectal prolapse and were treated without surgery. Four patients developed rectal stenosis with fecal incontinence because of burn scar contracture and were treated by anal dilatation, local transposition flaps, and/or excision of the scar and primary closure. Acute management of pediatric patients with such injuries can be conservative. Delayed complications of contractures of the perineum and genitals can be easily corrected with scar excisions, skin grafts, or the use of local skin flaps.\r"

Using the device, four subjects with stiff hands were measured before and after dynamic splinting treatments. During the 3-day treatment period, there were statistically significant differences in the angle of primary resistance (p less than 0.0001) and reactive torque (p less than 0.001). This initial trial suggests that: (1) finger stiffness can be quantified in terms of reactive torque as well as joint excursion, (2) dynamic rubber-band flexion splinting does alter joint condition and allow increased motion, (3) the amount of initial joint stiffness may be an indicator of treatment outcome, and (4) increasing treatment time may not enhance outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Smoke alarm giveaway programs can be successful, as demonstrated by the experience of the extensive 1982 Baltimore Fire Department project. In the absence of municipal government commitment for such an intensive campaign, a community program that involves many sectors can also be successful. It may, in fact, reach elements of the high-risk population who do not traditionally participate in smoke detector programs, such as renters. A decrease in \"extra-alarm\" fires and fire deaths can be achieved with multifaceted programs. In Dade County, with a growing population of approximately 1.7 million people that includes large migrant and illegal alien populations, fire-related deaths decreased from 26 in 1985 and 27 in 1986 to 17 in 1987. In the city of Miami, the county's inner core, fire-related deaths decreased by half from 1985 to 1987, in spite of an increase in high-risk population groups and substandard housing. Thus through extensive networking, the integrated efforts of a cross-section of the community can result in a successful safety campaign that has little overhead or political constraints. Designed as multifaceted, ongoing community-based programs, such efforts can, over time and through \"persistent learning,\" lead to desired changes in behavior.\r"

In contrast to the adult monkey, in which binding was confined to the adrenal gland, kidney, and smooth muscle, autoradiographic studies in the monkey fetus revealed the presence of high density binding in mesenchymal tissue throughout the body, especially in skeletal muscle and dermis. In the kidney at 11 weeks, binding was mainly associated with connective tissue surrounding primitive nephrons, while at 17 weeks, binding distribution was similar to that in the adult primate kidney, being confined to the glomeruli and smooth muscle of blood vessels, with low binding in the tubules. In fetal monkey adrenal, binding was high in the medulla and connective tissue of the capsule, and low in the zona glomerulosa, while in the adult, binding was high in the zona glomerulosa and medulla. In membrane preparations from fetal monkey skin and skeletal muscle, binding was specific for AII analogs, but in contrast to the adult adrenal, it was not affected by guanyl nucleotides. Scatchard analysis showed a single class of sites with a Kd of 0.6 +/- 0.1 nM and a capacity of 3060 +/- 8.3 fmol/mg, higher than that of the adult adrenal glomerulosa (605 +/- 30 fmol/mg). Specific binding for AII analogs was also present in human fetal skin and skeletal muscle membranes, where Scatchard analysis indicated a Kd of 0.8 nM and a binding capacity of 640 fmol/mg. The transient expression of abundant AII receptors during the phase of rapid growth in the fetus in conjunction with the known effects of AII on cellular growth suggest a role for AII during fetal development in the primate.\r"

Serum PIIINP and HA concentrations were measured in different thyroid function states, the former by two different assays, one detecting intact and aggregated PIIINP (PIIINP assay) and another detecting low mol wt degradation products of PIIINP as well (Fab-PIIINP assay). Two thirds of 28 hyperthyroid patients had elevated serum PIIINP values (mean, 192% in the PIIINP assay and 243% in the Fab-PIIINP assay) compared to age- and sex-matched controls (P less than 0.001). Normalization was seen after medical treatment (n = 16). In contrast, serum HA levels increased from 49 +/- 30 to 68 +/- 37 ng/mL (P less than 0.01) when a euthyroid state was achieved. Hypothyroid patients (n = 23) had increased serum HA levels (mean, 162%; P less than 0.05), which normalized after L-T4 treatment (71 +/- 50 before and 41 +/- 20 ng/mL after treatment (n = 16; P less than 0.02). L-T4 treatment also increased serum PIIINP levels significantly. Subjects with familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (n = 8), representing a situation with elevated circulating levels of T4 due to enhanced protein binding, and patients with nontoxic goiter with serum TSH levels ranging from 3.6-0.05 mU/L had normal serum levels of PIIINP and HA. Our data suggest that the secretion of procollagen III and that of HA from fibroblasts are influenced differently by thyroid hormones, since the secretion of procollagen III seems enhanced by thyroid hormones, whereas the secretion of HA seems reduced. Neither euthyroidism with enhanced serum T4 levels (familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia) nor euthyroidism with reduced serum TSH levels (nontoxic goiter) seems associated with alterations at the connective tissue level.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities in fasting lipid and lipoprotein levels are known to occur in obesity and other hyperinsulinemic states. However, postprandial lipoprotein metabolism has not been studied systematically in obese subjects using sensitive techniques to distinguish between triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles derived from the intestine and the liver. In the present study the vitamin A fat-loading test was used to label intestinally derived triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles in the postprandial state. Lipid parameters in seven normolipidemic obese subjects [body mass index, 43.7 +/- 2.81 kg/m2 (mean +/- SEM)] were compared to those in eight matched normal weight controls (body mass index, 23.6 +/- 0.72 kg/m2) during the 24-h period following ingestion of a mixed meal with a high fat content to which vitamin A had been added. Although subjects were selected for normal fasting lipid levels, in the obese group fasting triglycerides were significantly higher (1.35 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.68 +/- 0.08 mmol/L; P less than 0.0005) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was lower (0.94 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.35 +/- 0.11 mmol/L; P less than 0.01). The obese subjects had a greater postprandial triglyceride response to the test meal (P less than 0.05). The cumulative increment in total plasma triglycerides was 3.35-fold greater in obese than control subjects, while that of retinyl ester was only 1.63-fold greater, suggesting that a significant portion of the postprandial triglyceride response is due to endogenous hepatic lipoproteins. Postprandial plasma triglyceride and retinyl ester increment correlated with basal triglycerides (r = 0.72; P less than 0.005 and r = 0.57; P less than 0.03, respectively) and negatively with fasting HDL (r = -0.51; P less than 0.05 and r = -0.60; P less than 0.02, respectively). In the obese, the HDL triglyceride content increased maximally 4 h postprandially (4.1% to 6.1%; P less than 0.005) and phospholipid at 12 h (25.8% to 28.7%; P less than 0.05), with lower cholesteryl ester (21.1% to 17.5%; P less than 0.002) at 8 h, reflecting exchange of surface and core lipids with triglyceride-rich particles after the meal. In obese and control subjects the magnitude of HDL triglyceride enrichment after the meal correlated positively with the postprandial triglyceride increment (r = 0.74; P less than 0.007) and negatively with the fasting HDL cholesterol concentration (r = -0.80; P = 0.002). We conclude that even normolipidemic obese subjects have greater postprandial lipemia and triglyceride enrichment of HDL after ingestion of a high fat meal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Its etiology is uncertain; however, a few reports have indicated the occurrence of TSH binding-inhibiting immunoglobulins (TBII) and thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAb) in some of the patients. The present study was undertaken to evaluate thyroid function and the occurrence of TBII and TSAb and thyroid autoantibodies (antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal) in 53 patients with silent thyroiditis during the course of their disease. The patients were divided into 2 major groups: I) those who developed transient hypothyroidism and II) those who did not. All patients initially had significantly increased concentrations of serum T4, free T4, and free T3, suppressed TSH levels, and decreased thyroid radioiodine uptake. TBII and TSAb were initially positive in 8 (15.1%) and 10 patients (18.9%), respectively. Forty patients were available for follow-up. TBII was positive in 6 of 24 (25.0%), and TSAb was positive in 8 of 24 (33.3%) of the patients who developed transient hypothyroidism during the course of their disease. Among the patients who did not become hypothyroid at any time, TBII was positive in only 2 of 16 (12.5%), and none of the patients became TSAb positive. The findings indicate that increased TSAb and TBII activity may be detected in patients with silent thyroiditis and, when present, are associated with transient hypothyroidism during the course of the disease.\r"

While naloxone had no effect on heart rate or blood pressure at orgasm, a decrease in the level of subjective arousal and pleasure at orgasm was noted. We conclude that opioid receptor blockade with naloxone has an inhibitory effect on the neural pathways mediating the oxytocin response at orgasm.\r"

A pentagastrin test was performed as screening for familial MTC in eight patients with confirmed MTC at subsequent surgery; the calcitonin peak was equal or greater than 38 ng/L. Large differences exist between CT levels measured by RIA and immunoradiometric assay. The latter method provides a greater sensitivity to pentagastrin test and allows a better identification of microcarcinoma in hereditary cases of MTC.\r"

Endocrinological examination then demonstrated elevated plasma CRH and markedly elevated plasma ACTH, beta-lipotropin, and cortisol concentrations, increased urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid and 17-ketosteroid excretion, and no suppression of serum cortisol after low or high dose dexamethasone administration. Urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion increased in response to metyrapone, and lysine vasopressin elicited a striking increase in plasma ACTH. A computed tomographic scan of abdomen revealed multiple hypodense areas in the liver and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Postmortem histological examination revealed a necrotic hemorrhagic pituitary carcinoma with metastases to the liver, lung, and olfactory bulb. Immunohistochemical staining, gel filtration, and Northern blot analysis of liver and lung metastases revealed evidence of the production of both CRH and ACTH in these metastases.

Estradiol-17 beta (E2) silastic implants were inserted infrascapularly into 12 long-term ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) resulting in an average peripheral serum level of approximately 100 pg/ml estradiol. On day 6 of E2 treatment four treatment groups were initiated: Group I--estradiol implants only; Group II--estradiol implants plus 11 mumol progesterone/kg bodyweight in sesame oil via im injections on days 6,7,8; Group III--estradiol implants plus 2.2 mumol RU 486/kg in sesame oil via im injections on day 6,7,8; Group IV--estradiol implants plus 11 mumol RU 486/kg via im injections on day 6,7,8. On treatment day 9 endometrial biopsies were removed by hysterotomies. Cytosolic and nuclear estradiol receptor contents of tissues were estimated by charcoal method. In Group I, the tissue contained 376 +/- 123 pmol bound H-E2/g protein; the nuclear portion was about 16%. In Group II, the tissue contained 216 +/- 64 pmol bound 3H-E2/g protein; the nuclear portion was only 8%. In Group III, tissue contained 654 +/- 47 pmol bound H-E2/g protein; the nuclear portion was about 22%. In Group IV, the tissue contained 1198 +/- 172 pmol bound 3H-E2/g protein; the nuclear portion was about 17%. Scatchard plot analysis indicated a Kd app of 1.04 x 10(-9) M. This study demonstrates that after physiologic E2 replacement therapy estradiol receptor concentrations rise dramatically following anti-progestin treatment; this effect was dose dependent.\r"

The first family carries a single base substitution in the 29th codon which lies in the so-called CAGYC region; GCA (glycine) is replaced by AGA (arginine). This substitution induces conformational changes of the beta-polypeptide which make it unable to associate with the alpha-subunit. This mutation generates a new cleavage site for a restriction endonuclease MaeI, a new marker that can be used for DNA diagnosis. The second and third families were found to carry the same nucleotide substitution. Also, all three families were associated with an additional single base substitution in intron 2 as a polymorphic change, suggesting that these three families may have originated from the same single founder from Shikoku Island in Japan. The nucleotide sequence from the fourth and fifth families showed no alterations in the TSH beta gene from the about -200 basepair up-stream region to the polyadenylation site.\r"

  ".W": "Dexamethasone-suppression (DS) adrenal scintigraphy localizes an aldosteronoma, but with false-negative results, i.e. 2 of 19 cases in our study. Our aim was to clarify the clinical meaningfulness of this test. Adrenal iodomethyl-norcholesterol (NP-59) uptake on the adenoma side correlated with the estimated adenoma volume (n = 15, r = 0.843, P less than 0.001). Accordingly, the uptake ratio on the adenoma side to that on the opposite side depended on the adenoma volume (r = 0.683, P less than 0.01). This explains the false-negative results (uptake ratio less than 2) in two cases with small adenomas. The NP-59 uptake correlated weakly with the plasma aldosterone level (r = 0.516, P less than 0.05). This result indicates the low correlation between NP-59 uptake and the ability to secrete aldosterone. NP-59 accumulation in the surgically removed gland was analyzed by autoradiography in six cases where DS scintigraphy was done just before surgery. The density was higher in the adenoma cells than in the adjacent cortical cells in five cases, but the difference was rather small, i.e., within a 2-fold difference in four cases. In one case, almost the same density was observed in both types of cells. Thus, the laterality of NP-59 uptake primarily depends on the adenoma volume although NP-59 uptake somewhat reflects the adenoma's ability to secrete aldosterone or the adenoma cell's activity in accumulating NP-59. Care must be taken in interpreting the findings from DS scintigraphy where the adenoma is small or adrenal uptake is low.\r"

In the present study gastrin releasing peptide (GRP)-like immunoreactivity was measured in tissue extracts from these 34 MTC (25 inherited, 7 sporadic, 2 unclassified) and in 7 normal thyroid tissue. Plasma SRIH, calcitonin (CT) and carcinoembryonic antigen were assayed in all patients. Normal thyroid tissue contained less than 61 pmol GRP per g wet weight; in contrast GRP concentration was elevated (62-7800 pmol/g) in 32/34 tumor extracts. The distribution of tissue GRP values were similar in sporadic as well as in familial MTC. We found no significant correlation between tumor GRP concentration and plasma SRIH (r = -0.05), plasma CT (r = -0.24), or plasma carcinoembryonic antigen levels (r = -0.21). Tumor concentrations of immunoreactive GRP and SRIH were positively correlated when logarithmic transformation was used (P less than 0.01). Thus GRP, as well as SRIH, is a major product of tumoral C cells in human MTC when systematically evaluated in a large number of cases.\r"

PST-LI output (mean +/- SEM) in urine of normal subjects was 74.6 +/- 8.5 pmol/day and 87.1 +/- 11.7 pmol/g creatinine. That in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was 78.1 +/- 9.0 (SEM) pmol/day and 85.6 +/- 9.0 pmol/g creatinine and was not significantly different from that in normal subjects. Gel filtration analysis showed that PST-LI molecules excreted in urine of these two groups were smaller than human pancreastatin (43-52) (hPST-10) of C-terminal fragment. The PST-LI molecular forms were deduced to be nonbioactive from the result that hPST-10 did not inhibit pancreatic exocrine secretion. PST-LI excretion in patients with chronic renal failure was 258.5 +/- 62.9 pmol/day and 713.2 +/- 219.6 pmol/g creatinine. A molecular form corresponding to hPST-52 and a larger form eluted in the high mol wt region (approximately mol wt 15 K) were detected by gel filtration of urine from these patients, indicating that PST-LI is excreted in urine without degradation in patients with chronic renal failure. These results support the suggestion that the kidney may play an important role in PST degradation or metabolism.\r"

  ".U": "90383294\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated the mechanisms by which androgens increase mean circulating GH concentrations in boys. We tested two hypotheses: 1) testosterone increases serum GH concentrations at least in part via an androgen receptor-mediated mechanism, rather than exclusively by way of aromatization to estrogen; 2) androgen augments one or more specific features to GH secretion (secretory burst number, amplitude, and/or duration) and/or prolongs the half-life of GH removal. To examine these hypotheses, prepubertal boys with constitutionally delayed development and/or growth were given injections of testosterone (100 mg monthly; n = 7) or treated with oral oxandrolone, a nonaromatizable androgen (1.25 mg twice daily; n = 5). Pulsatile GH release was studied before and during androgen administration by sampling blood at 20-min intervals for 24 h. The immunoreactive GH time series were subjected to a novel deconvolution technique, which revealed that 1) testosterone and oxandrolone each increased mean (24-h) serum GH concentrations significantly; 2) both androgens augmented the daily endogenous GH secretory rate significantly; 3) increased GH production resulted from a higher mass of GH secreted per burst and a higher maximal rate of GH secretion within each burst; and 4) androgens amplified the magnitude of the nyctohemeral rhythm in the mass (but not frequency) of GH secretory pulses. The observed effects of androgen were specific, since the number and duration of GH secretory bursts and the subject-specific GH half-life were unaltered by androgen treatment. We conclude that androgen acting apart from conversion to estrogen is capable of specifically activating the somatotropic axis via distinct neuroendocrine secretory mechanisms.\r"

TBII was measured by a RRA, and thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSab) and thyroid-stimulation-blocking antibody (TSBab) were determined using porcine thyroid cells. The prevalence of patients having TBII was 11% or 7.4% of 148 patients, which was not significantly different from that of 5% or 9.6% of 52 patients with atrophic thyroiditis. Although TBII was shown to be TSBab in 6, TSab was found in the other 5 patients despite hypothyroidism. There was little correlation between severity of hypothyroidism and TBII or TSBab activity. One patient continued to be latently hypothyroid despite apparently positive TSBab. Five other patients with TSBab and 2 patients with TSab suffered from overt, irreversible hypothyroidism, and 2 of the patients with TSBab continued to be hypothyroid even after the disappearance of TSBab. Biopsy of the thyroid gland performed in 4 patients revealed severely damaged thyroid follicles with mononuclear cell infiltration with or without fibrosis. Three of the patients with TSab had been taking excess iodine, and recovery of thyroid function was observed after iodine restriction. A perchlorate discharge test performed in two of these patients was positive, suggesting an iodide organification defect. These results indicate that, although TBII is not infrequently found in goitrous hypothyroidism, cellular or chemical damage of the thyroid gland plays an important role in the pathogenesis of thyroid hypofunction and TSBab may only have a precipitating role.\r"

Eight healthy men were given four different diets varying in animal protein and in sodium content for 1 week each. On a high protein intake (2 g/kg.day) significant changes in urinary calcium, uric acid, and citrate excretion rates were found. Similar changes in calcium and citrate were induced by a high sodium intake (310 mmol/day). The changes were more pronounced when a high protein was combined with a high sodium diet. Urinary calcium increased from 3.79 +/- 0.31 to 6.42 +/- 0.61 mmol/24 h and urinary uric acid from 4.69 +/- 0.26 to 8.0 +/- 0.47, whereas urinary citrate decreased from 3.93 +/- 0.53 to 2.79 +/- 0.34 mmol/24 h. All three dietary regimens induced a significant decrease in the ability of urines to inhibit calcium oxalate monohydrate crystal agglomeration, which was most marked during the combined diet (from 345 +/- 39 to 205 +/- 28 min). The ability of urines to inhibit crystal agglomeration was related to their citrate content (r = 0.69, P less than 0.0001). These results show that high animal protein and/or sodium intake decrease the ability of urines to inhibit the agglomeration of calcium oxalate crystals and provide a possible physicochemical explanation for the adverse effects of dietary aberrations on renal stone formation.\r"

The location of cells accumulating radioactivity 60 min later was examined by autoradiography in two males and two females. In females, labeled neurons were observed in the hypothalamus, preoptic area, and amygdala, but not in the cerebral cortex. In one male a similar pattern of uptake was observed, but percentages of labeled neurons were lower, and in the other male very little labeling was observed in any region. The chemical identity of the radioactivity in cell nuclei was determined by high performance liquid chromatography in three males and four females. Concentrations of radioactivity in nuclear pellets were highest in the hypothalamus and lowest in the cerebral cortex. This regional variation was highly significant (P less than 0.001), but there was no significant difference between nuclear concentrations of radioactivity in males and females. In supernatant fractions, concentrations of radioactivity showed no significant variation between brain regions and after 60 min, 52-67% of the extracted radioactivity was no longer in the form of [3H]DES. Nuclear levels of radioactivity in pituitary glands and genital tracts of both male and female fetuses were 2-5 times higher than those in hypothalamus. The results demonstrated a direct interaction between DES and cell nuclei from specific regions of the brain, pituitary gland, and genital tract at this stage of gestation in a primate.\r"

In addition low levels of TTR mRNA were identified in the rat and human pancreas. All of the endocrine pancreatic tumors (two glucagonomas, two insulinomas, and one nonfunctional tumor) and the gut carcinoid also contained TTR mRNA, whereas other endocrine tumors (two pheochromocytomas and one paraganglioma) and one adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were TTR mRNA negative. The level of TTR mRNA expression in most of the endocrine pancreatic tumors exceeded that in the liver. The in vitro translations produced pre-TTR molecules of similar size for all TTR mRNA-positive human organs and tumors.\r"

  ".W": "PRL secretion from human endometrium is a continuous process extending from the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle throughout the entire gestational stage. We have developed a long term primary cell culture system to elucidate the hormonal requirements for this sustained production of PRL. The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), progesterone, and relaxin (RLX) on the production of immunoreactive PRL were investigated. MPA stimulated cell growth and PRL production rate during days 5-20 of culture. Progesterone was 20-40% less effective in stimulating PRL than MPA. Stimulation of PRL was continued 1-2 weeks after MPA withdrawal. Relaxin did not promote cell growth. However, it induced the PRL production which fluctuated during the long term culture. The maximal response to RLX was 2- to 3-fold higher or similar to that of MPA. Only five of nine endometrial specimens examined responded to RLX alone. The effect of MPA plus RLX was significantly greater than that of MPA or RLX alone. The highest production rate was shown in cells treated with MPA and then RLX in sequence. After a month of culture, the production rates (micrograms of PRL per 0.1 mg cell DNA/day) under various culture conditions (A, control; B, MPA; C, MPA for 10-15 days and no hormone afterward; D, both MPA and RLX; and E, MPA and RLX in sequence) were: A, about 0-0.01 (n = 12); B, 2.5 +/- 0.9 (n = 8); C, 4.8 +/- 2.5 (n = 8); D, 5.7 +/- 3.0 (n = 5); and E, 11 +/- 3.7 (n = 7); mean +/- SD; n, number of specimens). Endometrial stromal cells were incubated with [35S]methionine, and [35S]immunoreactive PRL and other secretory proteins were analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to characterize the size and isoforms of immunoreactive PRL. PRL was one of the five major secretory proteins (23-25K, 32K, 42K, 78K, and 150K daltons, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing condition) induced by MPA and RLX in endometrial stromal cells. More than 90% of immunoreactive PRL was secreted into the medium. The apparent mol wt of immunoreactive PRL were 21K, 23K (the predominant size), and 25K daltons. Results obtained from the incorporation of [14C]glucosamine into immunoreactive PRL indicated that both 23K and 25K PRL contained glycosylated PRL. A 45K-dalton glycosylated immunoreactive PRL was also present in the culture medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Circulating levels of adrenal delta 5-androgens [dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and its sulfate (DS)] selectively decrease with age in both sexes, while cortisol secretion remains unchanged. The mechanism(s) to account for this dissociation is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that a reduced enzymatic activity for delta 5-androgen biosynthesis may be responsible for this phenomenon by examining the ultradian and circadian rhythmicity (15-min sampling frequency for 24 h) of DHEA and cortisol and the responsiveness of DHEA, DS, and cortisol to human CRF stimulation and by the analysis of relative enzymatic activities in the biosynthesis of adrenal steroids in older postmenopausal women (PMW) and younger cycling women (NCW). Our data show that the timing of the circadian rhythm of DHEA secretion was not altered, but the acrophase amplitude was decreased (P less than 0.01) in aged PMW compared to NCW. While the pulse frequency of DHEA remained unchanged, the pulse amplitude was markedly attenuated in PMW compared with NCW (3.5 +/- 0.6 vs. 8.1 +/- 1.1 nmol/L; P less than 0.01). Correspondingly, the 24-h mean of DHEA was markedly reduced (P less than 0.001) in PMW (5.5 +/- 0.8 nmol/L) from that in NCW (12.1 +/- 1.4 nmol/L). For cortisol, all parameters were similar between the two groups. Thus, compared to NCW, the decline of circulating DHEA level in PMW was expressed by attenuations of pulse amplitude and circadian amplitude, without changes in the timing of the circadian rhythm or pulse frequency. Further, DHEA and DS, but not cortisol, responses to 8-h hCRF infusion were significantly (P less than 0.01) diminished in PMW. These findings together with decreased product/precursor ratios for DHEA/17-hydroxypregnenolone (P less than 0.01) and androstenedione/17-hydroxyprogesterone (P less than 0.05) suggest a reduction of 17,20-desmolase enzymatic activity in PMW compared to that in NCW. Steroid ratios for 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase were unaltered. We conclude from these preliminary data that the disparity of DHEA and cortisol secretion in aged PMW is probably related to an intraadrenal event, resulting from a decrease in 17,20-desmolase expression, which governs the biosynthesis of delta 5-adrenal androgen.\r"

Compared with that in normal subjects, CRH-BP binding decreased in patients with Cushing's syndrome of pituitary or adrenal origin and in patients who were treated with a high dose of glucocorticoids over a long period of time. On the other hand, CRH-BP binding increased in patients with Addison's disease or hypopituitarism. In patients with Addison's disease, the high level of CRH-BP binding fell to the control level after glucocorticoid replacement. In patients with Cushing's syndrome, CRH-BP binding gradually increased and reached the higher level about 1 yr after surgery. Thereafter, it returned to the control level. There was a good negative correlation between the levels of plasma cortisol and CRH-BP binding in patients with Cushing's syndrome before and after surgery. A Scatchard analysis of CRH-BP binding in patients with Cushing's syndrome and in normal subjects showed that the binding affinity was similar in both groups, but that the number of binding sites was low in patients with Cushing's syndrome. These results suggest that in human plasma, glucocorticoids decrease CRH-BP binding. This seems to be caused by a decrease in the concentration of CRH-BP in the plasma of patients with hypercortisolemia.\r"

Free T and non-SHBG-bound T were calculated using the measured total T, the concentrations of albumin and SHBG, and the association constants of T to albumin and SHBG. Total body fat content was measured by deuterium-water isotope dilution. Findings were as follows. 1) BMI was very highly correlated with total body fat content (r = 0.96; P less than 0.001); thus, the degree of obesity can be calculated just as appropriately from simple height and weight measurements as from measurements of total body fat content. 2) Total, non-SHBG-bound, and free T were all highly correlated inversely with BMI; for total T, r = -0.727, P less than 0.01; for non-SHBG-bound T, r = 0.677, P less than 0.01; and for free T, r = -0.653, P less than 0.01. Thus, free T and non-SHBG-bound T are decreased in obese men in proportion to the degree of obesity, just as is the case for total T; percentage-wise, the decrease was the same for all 3 parameters.\r"

The same study was carried out in 9 age- and weight-matched normal cycling women who served as controls. Mean (+/- SE) serum GH concentrations over the 14-h period were markedly lower in the subjects with PCO (0.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms/L; P less than 0.005). Eight of 10 subjects with PCO had mean serum GH concentrations below 1.2 micrograms/L, while only 1 of 9 control subjects had corresponding values below this concentration. In contrast, mean circulating serum concentrations of IGF-I were indistinguishable in the 2 groups. We conclude from these data that PCO is characterized by decreased serum GH concentrations in the face of normal serum IGF-I concentrations. The mechanisms underlying this alteration in the GH/IGF-I axis and its role in the pathogenesis of PCO remain to be clarified.\r"

  ".U": "90383314\r", 
  ".W": "The relative contributions of GH, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), estradiol, and testosterone to the pubertal growth spurt are incompletely understood. We studied 8 patients (5 girls and 3 boys) with true precocious puberty and GH deficiency due to CNS lesions to assess the role of sex steroids in pubertal growth independent of an increase in circulating GH. Included is 1 patient with an unusual hypothalamic lesion due to head trauma. A control group of 17 GH-sufficient patients with true precocious puberty (13 girls and 4 boys) was matched for chronological age. The GH-deficient girls grew at a mean velocity of 9.2 cm/yr (range, 7.2-14.4), and the boy's mean height velocity was 7.9 cm/yr (6.1-9.9). Mean bone age was advanced in the GH-deficient group (girls, +2.7 SD; boys, +2.6 SD), but not as much as the GH-sufficient controls (girls, +5.4 SD; boys, +4.3 SD). The mean concentration of plasma IGF-I was lower in the GH-deficient group than in the control group, but was greater than the mean concentration in age-matched prepubertal GH-deficient patients. Four GH-deficient patients were treated with a potent agonist of LRF. This caused suppression of gonadal sex steroid concentrations and a fall in mean height velocity from 9.1 to 4.3 cm/yr after 1 yr of therapy; however, circulating GH and IGF-I values were not uniformly altered. We conclude that a substantial pubertal growth spurt can occur in patients with true precocious puberty and GH deficiency that is dependent on gonadal sex steroids yet unaccompanied by normal pubertal levels of circulating GH or IGF-I. Reversal of this growth acceleration is possible with sex steroid suppression. The results, in light of previous in vivo and in vitro studies, suggest that the normal pubertal growth spurt is mediated in part by direct effects of sex steroids at the growth plate.\r"

Follicular stimulation with purified FSH after the suppression of ACTH and gonadotropin secretion by corticoid analogs and superactive GnRH agonist permitted ovum pick-up and the study of steroid synthesis in the obtained granulosa cells. Progesterone synthesis was elevated while 17 alpha-hydroxy progesterone, testosterone, androstenedione, and estrogen production was minimal. Aromatase activity was retained in these cells, as demonstrated by the 100-fold increase in estrogen levels after the addition of androgens. Progesterone levels in follicular fluids were in the normal range, while estrogen, 17 alpha-hydroxy progesterone, and androgen levels were minimal. These results provide in vitro evidence of 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency in the granulosa cells of this patient.\r"

To determine the skeletal effect of weight-bearing exercise in premenopausal women, we prospectively evaluated the effects of a weight-training program on lumbar spine bone mass in 10 women (mean +/- SEM, 36.2 +/- 1.3 yr) and compared the results with those in 7 sedentary women (40.4 +/- 1.6 yr). None of the women had previously participated in a weight-training program, and all ingested a 500-mg calcium supplement each day throughout the study. Axial loading and balance of large muscle groups were emphasized. Individual strength increased by 57 +/- 8% over 9 months. Despite the increase in muscle strength, lumbar spine bone density in the exercising women decreased by 2.90% at 4.5 months and 3.96% at 9 months (P = 0.01). In contrast, there was no change in lumbar density in the controls over the 9-month period. We conclude that short term weight training at this frequency and intensity decreases vertebral bone mass in premenopausal women.\r"

The histological picture characteristically showed broad strands of medium sized cells with irregularly shaped nuclei and a fairly broad rim of slightly basophilic cytoplasm. One case developed into a centroblastic polymorphic lymphoma. Bone marrow infiltration was documented in three cases and leukaemic conversion in one case of MBCL. Seven patients had enlarged spleens. Eight patients were in stage I, five in stage II/IIE, two in stage IIIs and six in stage IV at the time of diagnosis. Of 18 patients subsequently followed up, eight were in complete remission, two in partial remission, and three were undergoing treatment at completion of the study; five patients had died. Relapse occurred in nine patients and was a common feature of MBCL. The prognosis of MBCL was comparable with that of other low grade malignant lymphomas. Fourteen patients presented with primary nodal lymphoma. In seven patients with nodal MBCL, however, a concomitant low grade B cell lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) was also found in the stomach (n = 4), nasopharynx (n = 1), salivary glands (n = 1) and thyroid gland (n = 1). Two of these cases developed into high grade lymphoma. These extra-nodal manifestations were found simultaneously with MBCL in five patients. In another two patients, however, these symptoms occurred in a later phase of the disease. It is emphasised that adequate staging procedures must be carried out in any case of nodal MBCL to exclude underlying low grade B cell lymphoma of the MALT.\r"

The influence of the number of cells with increased DNA content (more than 2N) on survival was evaluated. Analyses were carried out on the small samples obtained by needle aspiration biopsy of lymph nodes before treatment, using microdensitometry and Feulgen staining. Patients whose lymphomas contained less than 6% of cells with increased DNA content had a mean survival of 81.3 months and those whose lymphomas contained 6% or more of such cells had a mean survival of 18.5 months. A significant difference in survival using the same criteria was also noticed for patients with both low grade lymphomas and those with intermediate and high grade lymphomas. It is concluded that cytophotometric analysis of lymph node aspirates is of prognostic value in the initial assessment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

The highest incidence of disease (83%) was seen in small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and the lowest (19%) in diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL). Among cases with positive marrows, disease was bilateral in all 15 cases of SLL but in only 10 of 20 (50%) of the DLCL cases. In 30 of 99 (30%) positive marrows disease was unilateral. Follicular lymphomas were strongly associated with a paratrabecular pattern, with 40 of 45 positive cases showing this. Discordant histology was seen in six of 20 positive cases of DLCL and two of 37 positive cases of follicular small cleaved cell lymphomas (FSCCL). A bone marrow aspirate was positive in only 56 of the 99 (57%) cases. Peripheral blood disease was present in 15% of the bone marrow positive cases and in 6% of the cases overall. The incidence of marrow disease varies with the histological subtype of lymphoma. The paratrabecular pattern is associated with follicular lymphoma, and bilateral biopsy specimens increase the positivity rate in most subtypes of NHL.\r"

Cytomegalovirus infection occurred in only six allogeneic recipients. Herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus infections occurred infrequently. Seven patients who were considered at the time of death to have died due to an infectious cause were studied virologically at necropsy. In only one patient was a virus infection thought to have been the cause of death. Prophylaxis with acyclovir may have influenced the rate and clinical prominence of herpes virus infections.

Grade 1 villous flattening was observed in 41% of cases positive for Giardia and in 37.5% of the control cases. The mean content of intraepithelial lymphocytes was 24.5 compared with 22.6 intraepithelial lymphocytes/100 epithelial cells in the positive and negative groups, respectively. Lymphoid follicles were more frequently observed in Giardia positive specimens, but their incidence was not significantly higher compared with that of controls. Twenty five per cent of patients positive for Giardia showed light, 41% intermediate, and 34% heavy colonisation by Giardia trophozoites. In 76% the parasites were observed in all specimens obtained.

Digestion of DNA with HaeIII, which gave the clearest band pattern of the 20 enzymes tested, showed that each set of isolates from a single patient had a unique band pattern. The DNA signature band patterns of strains from different patients were less than or equal to 62% similar (average 43%); similarities of patterns from the same patient were generally greater than or equal to 86%. Some minor but reproducible polymorphisms (less than or equal to five bands) in the signature region were detected in most consecutive isolates. Plasmid DNA was detected in isolates from five patients, but major pattern differences were attributed to genomic variation. It is concluded that the HaeIII DNA digest signature fingerprints provide a reproducible and sensitive method of discriminating between isolates of H pylori.\r"

Cytochemical examination of the ultrastructural calcium localisation using the phosphate-pyroantimonate method showed considerable variation in the subcellular calcium distribution. In normal myocytes calcium precipitates were confined to the inner leaflet of the sarcolemma, T-tubules, intercalated disks, and sporadically to mitochondria. In contrast, extensive calcification of mitochondria and loss of sarcolemmal calcium was evident in necrotic myocytes. A number of grossly normal myocytes also showed an increase of calcium precipitates in slightly swollen mitochondria. These findings suggest that myocardial calcium overload in this case started in viable myocytes and was not merely a secondary phenomenon occurring after cell death.\r"

For every 50 cells the mean AgNOR counts were as follows: normal endocervical cells (n = 15) 79.8 (95% Cl 68-91); AIS (n = 20) 200.7 (95% Cl 182-219); and invasive adenocarcinoma (n = 30) 299 (271-328). There was no overlap between the groups of normal endocervical cells and invasive adenocarcinoma, but there was significant overlap between cases of invasive adenocarcinoma and carcinoma in situ. In six out of 17 cases with AIS, NOR count in adjacent morphologically normal glandular cells (\"internal\" controls) was increased when compared with the \"external\" (normal endocervical) control group. This suggests the presence of wider field changes not previously identified using routine histological methods. The findings suggest that AIS is a potential premalignant precursor of invasive adenocarcinoma, but that assessment of NORs is of no practical use in discriminating between the histological types of cervical carcinoma.\r"

The age specific incidence of complete mole was minimal between the ages of 30 and 34 years (relative risk 1), showed a minor peak in teenagers (relative risk 3.1, 95% confidence interval 6.5-1.4), and a major peak in those of 35 years and over.

No age group showed a significantly increased risk of partial mole. The women of Abu Dhabi had increased risks of both forms of molar pregnancy relative to women in Nottingham, England (relative risk 1): the risk of complete mole was increased threefold (95% CI 4.2-2.2) and that of partial mole twofold (95% CI 4.0-1.2). The increased risk of complete mole was greatest in Gulf Arabs (mainly Omanis and Yemenis) who had a sixfold increase in crude relative risk (95% CI 10.7-3.5).

Blood (2 microliters) is added to 2 ml of 0.4 microM thiazole orange in phosphate buffered saline, incubated at room temperature for 90 minutes, and analysed on a Coulter EPICS Profile flow cytometer, with gating for red cells on the basis of forward and right angled light scatter. Blood (2 microliters) is also incubated with phosphate buffered saline alone as an unstained control. The adult reference range (mean +/- 2 SD), established from 30 laboratory personnel, is 19.4-59.2 x 10(9)/l (0.2-1.6%). Comparison of this technique was made on 39 selected patient samples with visual counting of cells stained with brilliant cresyl blue. The correlation between the two methods was 0.99 with slope 0.96 and intercept 0.02. The precision of the automated technique in three subjects with reticulocyte counts of 0.12%, 1.84%, and 14.3% was 33.3%, 7.3%, and 1.4%, respectively (coefficient of variations). In three patients studied serially after intensive chemotherapy, in whom the reticulocyte count quantitated by routine visual methods approached zero (0-0.1%) for eight to 18 days, the automated counts varied between 0 and 0.5%. Flow cytometric reticulocyte counting is thus a simple and highly reliable methodology for the quantitation of normal and raised reticulocyte counts but cannot be reliably used to quantitate a subnormal level.\r"

Twenty abnormal samples covering a wide spectrum of International Normalised Ratio (INR) were distributed to users of the KC4/KC10 and Coag-a-Mate instruments. Coagulometer results were compared with those of the manual method. A substantial minority with each system showed good agreement with the manual reference values. There was, however, a considerable variation between instruments, meaningful in clinical terms, evidenced by varying regression slopes and local system International Sensitivity Indices (ISI). For intense anticoagulation (3.0 to 4.5 INR) a larger dose of warfarin is needed with the Coag-a-Mate than with the KC instruments. With a manual INR of 4.0 the KC instruments tended to give longer PT (mean INR + 0.3); the Coag-a-Mate PT was generally shorter (mean INR -0.1). With both systems the mean normal PT were shorter than the manual but the degree of shortening did not parallel that of the abnormal samples. This effect undermines the use of a simple prothrombin ratio and of an INR value derived from it, based on a manual ISI. The use of a system related ISI cannot, however, be recommended until local instrument variables are controlled.\r"

Antigen was detected in the urine of 93 (77%) of 120 patients, overall, and in 86% of patients from whom a specimen obtained within seven days of onset of illness was available. On all but one occasion the first urine sample taken from a patient for whom a positive ELISA result was obtained, was itself positive. In one case antigen was not detected at four days but was present on the fifth day after onset of symptoms. In two patients urinary antigen was detectable as early as two days after onset of symptoms. In another the antigen persisted for at least 60 days. More than half the patients, however, had stopped producing detectable antigen within 14 days of onset of symptoms. It is therefore important that where Legionnaires' disease is suspected urine is collected as early as possible in the course of the disease.\r"

The positive predictive value of the test was 63%, and the greatest difficulty was posed by the detection of IgM EBV VCA positive, heterophile antibody negative samples. Significant false positive results were obtained in sera with evidence of current Toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus infection. Rheumatoid factor was not a problem. Modification of the test protocol improved its performance: the positive predictive value rose to 87% and the negative predictive value to 81%. Although our modifications did not increase the speed of the test, there was reliable information on the EBNA-1 state.

Parenteral administration of either vaccine followed by infection was much more effective than infection alone in the induction of either homologous or heterologous immunity. On the basis of this model simulation of human experience and other earlier studies, it seems that purified NA vaccine may offer an important new strategy as an initial step in immunization against influenza in humans.\r"

Monitoring included daily recording of the presence of diarrhea and weekly stool collection. Stool specimens containing rotavirus were analyzed by a monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based ELISA specific for the VP7 protein of serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 and by gel electrophoresis. A total of 318 children had 362 rotavirus episodes; 149 could be serotyped. Serotype distribution of this population was similar to that of children hospitalized for diarrhea in a large pediatric hospital in Houston during the same period. Symptomatic infections were predominantly due to serotype 1 rotaviruses in season 2 and serotype 3 rotaviruses in season 3. Episodes recurred in 43 children; 2 children had second symptomatic infections of the same serotype as the first. Electrophoretic differences among rotaviruses of a same serotype were common and more frequent among serotype 1 than serotype 3 viruses.\r"

Multivariate analysis indicated that prevalence was higher among men, blacks, and unmarried men and peaked at ages 30-34. The crude incidence density was 0.20/1000 person-years, and multivariate analysis of incidence revealed patterns similar to those for prevalence. Comparison of prevalence and incidence data provides evidence that an increasing proportion of infection is occurring among women and in nonmetropolitan and small urban areas.\r"

In most cases, this antigen-specific lysis is not mediated by T lymphocytes. Lymphoblastoid cell lines infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing different forms of the envelope protein of HIV-1 were used as target cells in chromium-release assays of primary cytotoxic effector cells and of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). By depleting effector cells of CD16+ lymphocytes, or by blocking target cell lysis with an anti-human IgG serum, primary env-specific lysis was found to be due to ADCC, the effector cells being armed in vivo with specific, cytophilic antibodies. This phenomenon is dependent on cell surface expression of the envelope protein and is directed against both gp120 and gp41. Human HIV-1 antibody-positive sera are able to mediate ADCC against HIV-infected CD4+ T lymphocytes, suggesting a possible role of ADCC in the natural infection.\r"

Brain sections from normal autopsies (n = 17) and other neurologic conditions (n = 4) were used as controls. Specific amplified products were detected in 20 (83%) of 24 patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. PCR did not amplify JCV or human beta-globin gene sequences in four patients with characteristic demyelinating lesions of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy that were positive for JCV by in situ hybridization or immunocytochemistry. PCR from biopsy sections resulted in more intense amplification signals than PCR from autopsy tissue. Normal brain sections from 17 autopsies were negative by PCR. Low-grade amplification of JCV was observed in one patient with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. PCR served as a more rapid test for confirmation of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy than in situ hybridization. However, PCR performance was altered by prolonged formalin fixation of tissue and undetermined inhibitors of the amplification reaction. Laboratories and clinicians should be aware of the difficulties encountered when using paraffin-embedded tissue for PCR.\r"

None of the HIV-seronegative individuals lost reactivity to a treponemal test, whereas 7% of the seropositive asymptomatic individuals and 38% of those with symptomatic HIV infection had loss of reactivity. Symptomatic HIV infection was associated with loss of reactivity, as a T4 lymphocyte count less than 200 X 10(6)/1, a T4-to-T8 ratio less than 0.6, a single prior episode of syphilis, and a low VDRL titer at the time of the last documented episode of syphilis. Although no conclusions can be drawn about the sensitivity of treponemal tests in patients with active syphilis and HIV infection, these data suggest that treponemal tests may not identify those previously infected with Treponema pallidum.\r"

Penetration of HEp-2 epithelial cells by C. jejuni was significantly inhibited (P less than .05) with C. jejuni lysate and a monoclonal antibody (MAb 1B4) in competitive inhibition assays. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that MAb 1B4 bound to the flagella and cell surface of low-passage (invasive) C. jejuni M 96, whereas only the flagella of high-passage (noninvasive) C. jejuni M 96 were labeled. Western blot analysis revealed that MAb 1B4 identified an epitope on antigens of 64-44 kDa in lysates prepared from invasive and noninvasive isolates. In addition, antigens of 42-38 kDa were recognized in lysates prepared from only invasive C. jejuni strains. Proteinase K and sodium meta-periodate chemical treatment of C. jejuni M 96 lysate changed the mobility of antigens recognized by MAb 1B4. The increase in mobility demonstrated a decrease in size of molecules and suggested that antigens required for HEp-2 cell invasion by Campylobacter species may be glycoprotein in nature.\r"

  ".W": "The specific binding of radiolabeled polymyxin B (PmB) to rat alveolar macrophages was investigated. PmB retained its ability to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor production by macrophages as long as one of five amino groups on PmB was unbound. Binding was saturable and temperature- and time-dependent, reaching steady state by 30 min at 37 degrees C and by 18 h at 4 degrees C. Macrophages had approximately 1.6 X 10(7) (Kd = 0.28 nM) PmB binding sites per cell. Lipid A had no appreciable effect on the number of sites. Binding did not occur to rat platelets, L929 fibroblast cells, a rat thymoma cell line, or precursor monocytic and myeloid cell lines. Precursor cells activated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate acquired binding similar to that seen in alveolar macrophages, but L929 fibroblasts did not. Binding sites were sensitive to trypsin but not to phospholipase C. PmB may interact with specific binding sites involved in lipopolysaccharide-induced activation, production, or release of tumor necrosis factor by macrophages, inhibiting the effects of lipopolysaccharide on macrophages.\r"

Light and electron microscopic observations indicated delay in development of the outer hyphal wall. Cilofungin also blocked incorporation of the chitin substrate, N-acetylglucosamine, into mycelia. However, when C. immitis was grown under conditions that induced spherule development, drug effects were dramatically decreased. Furthermore, efficacy of cilofungin in treatment of murine coccidioidomycosis could not be demonstrated. These studies indicate that glucan-synthase inhibitors have activity against C. immitis, and other compounds with different pharmacologic properties or in combination with other antifungal drugs may exploit this biologic effect.\r"

Nearly all injuries (greater than 98%) were needlesticks; less than 5% were reported to occupational health services. Rates of ward-related injury were highest for students (0.97/py) and decreased during training. Most injuries were due to recapping of used needles. In contrast to ward-related injury, rates of operating room-related injury were relatively low for nonsurgical students and interns (0.3/py), higher for surgical students (1.36/py), and stable over surgical residency training (mean, 5.4/py). Virtually all surgical injuries occurred during suturing. Further research into mechanisms of needlestick injuries and product design for their prevention are needed.\r"

Staphylococcus aureus was the infecting microorganism in 75% of the HIV-positive patients and 86% of the HIV-negative patients. Overall survival for the HIV-positive patients was 85% compared with 93% for the HIV-negative patients. Ninety percent of patients with asymptomatic HIV infection survived, whereas 60% of patients in CDC group IV survived (P = .052). In contrast to New Jersey seroprevalence surveys showing HIV antibody in 10%-50% of intravenous drug users, HIV antibody seroprevalence rate in this selected population was 75%. IE in the HIV-seropositive intravenous drug user is essentially the same as in the seronegative user. However, patients with symptomatic HIV infection may be more likely to die from their IE. Intravenous drug users with IE have a greater-than-expected seroprevalence of HIV; the reason remains to be determined.\r"

The military forces, as a precaution against further spread of the virus, vaccinated all recruits in late September. They received oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) simultaneously with prophylactic immune serum globulin (ISG) to protect against hepatitis A virus infection. Since it is generally not recommended to administer live vaccines simultaneously with ISG, the serologic response to OPV given at the same time as ISG was compared with the response when OPV was given alone; specimens were also available from a control group receiving ISG alone. No effect of ISG on the antibody response to OPV was found, and thus there appears to be no contraindication to giving OPV at the same time as injecting pooled ISG--particularly relevant for travelers to areas endemic for both diseases, who have to leave at short notice. Of recruits 18-19 years of age, 21% lacked antibodies to type 1 poliovirus, suggesting either a decline in antibody titers with age or a lack of vaccine potency during earlier years. After the booster, only 2% lacked type 1 antibody, and the geometric mean titer increased from 1:16 to 1:698.\r"

C. trachomatis was amplified by all three primer pairs and the amplified fragment was digested by EcoRI. C. pneumoniae was amplified by only two of the three primer pairs, and the amplified fragment was digested by EcoRI. C. psittaci was amplified by only two of the pairs and the amplified fragment was EcoRI-resistant. C. trachomatis was detected in direct patient specimens, tissue culture specimens, and fixed specimens, and all serovars of C. trachomatis were detectable. The polymerase chain reaction can detect and differentiate the three species of Chlamydia and may prove a valuable diagnostic tool.\r"

Retrospective analysis revealed that 8% of stool samples harbored B. hominis. The median age of the carriers was 37 years; 55% were female. Prospective analysis of 139 patients showed that most (76%) of 86 in whom B. hominis was the sole organism found (and for whom data were complete) continued to harbor the parasite in stool samples submitted a median of 57 days after the first sample. There was no correlation between the presence of B. hominis and symptoms. Thus, B. hominis, though commonly seen in stool samples submitted to this laboratory, is thought to be a commensal organism.\r"

Gastroduodenal intubation was performed in six healthy subjects and five patients with Wilson's disease. After intravenous infusion of octapeptide of cholecystokinin (40 ng/kg/hr) the pancreaticobiliary secretion of zinc increased from a basal rate of 283.1 +/- 75.8 nmol/L/min to a peak of 716.6 +/- 175.3 nmol/L/min in normal subjects. Normal subjects with a zinc-deficient diet had both lower basal (66.8 +/- 15.8 nmol/L/min) and stimulated (559.5 +/- 31 nmol/L/min) pancreaticobiliary secretion of zinc than with a zinc-sufficient diet. In contrast to the markedly reduced pancreaticobiliary secretion of copper, patients with Wilson's disease not treated with zinc had normal basal (226.6 +/- 126 nmol/L/min) and stimulated (728.7 +/- 195.5 nmol/L/min) zinc secretion. These studies indicate that a considerable amount of zinc is being secreted in pancreaticobiliary fluid in healthy subjects and there was no impairment of zinc secretion in patients with Wilson's disease. Our data also indicate that pancreaticobiliary secretion of zinc is dependent on the zinc status of the subjects, suggesting that endogenous secretion of zinc may play a significant role in the homeostasis of zinc.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier experiments showed that platelet agglutination induced by von Willebrand factor (vWf) plus ristocetin was greatly diminished if adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was added first in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (to prevent aggregation). Platelets treated with ADP and then fixed also agglutinated less than control fixed platelets. The studies reported here demonstrate that ADP did not decrease ristocetin-induced binding of vWf whether binding was measured on suspended platelets with iodine 125-labeled vWf or on suspended or agglutinated platelets with the use of any of three 125I-labeled monoclonal antibodies that bind to vWf but that do not interfere with ristocetin-induced agglutination. Equal amounts of vWf were eluted from ristocetin/vWf-treated platelets when they were resuspended without ristocetin, whether or not the platelets had been exposed to ADP, and the vWf recovered in either case was composed only of large multimers. No evidence for an agglutination site other than glycoprotein Ib could be demonstrated by measuring agglutination of a mixture of platelets fixed after inhibition with antibody against glycoprotein Ib and platelets fixed after inhibition with ADP. We conclude that inhibition of agglutination by ADP must involve the way in which vWf is bound, because it does not result from a decreased amount or from a difference in multimer size of bound vWf.\r"

For both blacks and whites serum creatinine levels increased slowly with age, until 11 years of age when a steeper increase occurred to around 19 years of age. Before this age there was a significant age by sex interaction (p less than 0.0001) in the distributions of serum creatinine. After the age of 19 years mean serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in black men than in white men (1.16 mg/dl vs 1.09 mg/dl, p less than 0.0005) and in black women than in white women (0.87 mg/dl vs 0.84 mg/dl, p less than 0.08). Creatinine levels were also significantly higher in men than in women (1.11 mg/dl vs 0.85 mg/dl, p less than 0.0001). Creatinine clearance, estimated from an equation using serum creatine, age, and weight, showed a steady increase until 13 years of age when a maximum range of 120 to 140 ml/min was reached. By the age of 19 years the clearance had declined to a relatively constant range of 100 to 120 ml/min. Black men had the highest correlation of serum creatinine concentration with height, weight, and lean body mass after adjusting for age. White men had the highest correlation of serum creatinine concentration with uric acid. Diastolic blood pressure becomes an important determinant of creatinine levels by the age of 11 years. The race-sex differences in serum creatinine levels in children and young adults are likely related to body mass.\r"

Because of the regulatory role of iron in transferrin receptor expression, we have now examined the relationship between iron and the release of soluble transferrin receptor from HL60 cells. Cells grown in serum-free, transferrin-free medium containing iron-pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (Fe-PIH) displayed approximately 70% less iodine 125-labeled transferrin surface binding and released 60% less soluble transferrin receptor than cells grown in serum-supplemented medium. Incubation of cells with increasing concentrations of Fe-PIH resulted in a progressive decrease in the release of soluble transferrin receptor over 18 hours of incubation. In contrast, receptor release was increased after incubation of cells with the iron chelator deferoxamine. This effect was completely blocked by cycloheximide. Transferrin receptor release from cells over 2 hours was unaffected by the presence of transferrin-iron, suggesting that transferrin receptor release occurs independent of the cellular handling of its ligand. Exposure of cells to phorbol myristate acetate resulted in a decrease in cell surface transferrin receptor and a decrease in the release of soluble transferrin receptor. Our studies show that transferrin receptor release from HL60 cells changes during iron excess or iron deficiency and that these changes are the result of alterations in cell surface transferrin receptor density. Our studies suggest that elevated serum transferrin receptor levels seen in clinical iron deficiency reflect corresponding increases in transferrin receptors at the cellular level.\r"

  ".W": "Detailed studies in murine models show inhaled staphylococci are killed mainly by alveolar macrophages. Recently, using histology and lung lavage to determine the site of killing of inhaled 59Fe-labeled pneumococci in rats, we found unexpectedly that most of the organisms were killed extracellularly. In the present studies we compared clearance of inhaled 59Fe-pneumococci in rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits to determine if extracellular killing of pneumococci is species-dependent. Absolute clearance rates were measured using Andersen plates. lung lavage and differential centrifugation were used to measure leukocyte-associated and free 59Fe-pneumococci and nonsedimentable 59Fe. Clearance was rapid in all species but was fastest in rabbits, which killed pneumococci almost as quickly as they were deposited (p less than 0.025 versus rats and guinea pigs). At 1-1/2 hours after pneumococcal deposition in rats, when clearance had reached 92%, alveolar macrophages contained only 31% of the total 59Fe while 56% was in the nonsedimentable, extracellular fraction. At 1-1/2 hours in guinea pigs, when clearance was 96% complete, macrophages contained 51% of the 59Fe and 34% was nonsedimentable (p less than 0.002 versus rats). In rabbits at 1-1/2 hours, macrophages had 94% of the 59Fe and only 4% was nonsedimentable (p less than 0.001 versus the other species). In no species were opsonic antibodies detected in sera or concentrated lavage. In vitro, rabbit and guinea pig alveolar macrophages killed pneumococci opsonized with both specific antibody and fresh serum, while rat macrophages had little activity (p less than 0.001). We conclude that the role of alveolar macrophages in killing inhaled pneumococci varies in different species.\r"

In four patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II (family E) and type VI (family M), the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of fibronectin receptor was significantly decreased to 2.2 to 2.9 x 10(3) sites/cell (normal range 6.3 +/- 1.5 x 10(3) sites/cell). The Bmax values of healthy members of their families were normal or moderately decreased to 3.8 to 5.1 x 10(3) sites/cell. In a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta type III (family K) the Bmax was significantly decreased to 1.1 x 10(3) sites/cell, but healthy members of his family had normal Bmax values. In a patient with Marfan syndrome (family A) the Bmax was decreased to 4.3 x 10(3) sites/cell. The dissociation constant of the fibronectin receptor was normal in all subjects examined. Some healthy members of the families of the patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome had moderately decreased Bmax values, suggesting that they are carriers of an abnormal gene causing this disorder. These data suggest that fibronectin receptor is closely related to the pathogenesis of hereditary connective tissue diseases.\r"

  ".W": "In using National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (for desirable low risk, a total cholesterol level less than 200 mg/dl, and for high risk, a level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) less than 35 mg/dl), our specific aim was to examine lack of concordance in classification of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk by HDLC less than 35 mg/dl in subjects with total cholesterol less than 200 and to determine whether lack of concordance increased as group CHD risk increased. We studied four cohorts ranging from putatively low to high CHD risk. These included self-referred subjects in a public urban total cholesterol screening (n = 897), hospitalized patients with depression (n = 144), Cholesterol Center referrals at presumed high CHD risk (n = 1120), and patients having coronary arteriography (n = 145) because of presumed coronary artery disease. Total cholesterol was less than 200 mg/dl in 25% of subjects from the urban sampling, in 54% of hospitalized patients with depression, in 27% of Cholesterol Center referrals, and in 41% of those undergoing cardiac catheterization. In these four cohorts, of subjects with total cholesterol less than 200, 7%, 26%, 25%, and 48%, respectively, had HDLC less than 35 mg/dl. The likelihood of having total cholesterol less than 200 and HDLC less than 35 mg/dl was 1.7% in urban public subjects, 6.8% in Cholesterol Center referrals, 13.9% in depressed patients, and 20% in cardiac catheterization patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cell calcium, which in the controls was 5.5 mumol/L of cells, was elevated in patients with CRF--30.6 +/- 6.8 mumol/L of cells (p less than 0.002)--and in patients receiving CAPD-23.6 +/- 6.7 mumol/L of cells (p less than 0.02). Basal CaATPase activity in controls was 850.7 +/- 66.7 nmol inorganic phosphate per milligram of protein per hour. It was suppressed in patients with CRF and patients receiving CAPD: 504.9 +/- 34.4 nmol inorganic phosphate per milligram of protein per hour and 618.2 +/- 47.3 nmol inorganic phosphate per milligram of protein per hour, respectively (p less than 0.01). Calmodulin-stimulated CaATPase revealed a pattern similar to that of CaATPase basal activity. RBC calcium showed an inverse correlation with CaATPase activity (r = -0.935, p less than 0.005) in patients with CRF. Calcium influx was increased in patients with CRF and in patients receiving CAPD: 12.00 +/- 1.34 mumol/L of cells per hour and 13.60 +/- 1.70, respectively, compared with 4.61 +/- 0.39 mumol/L of cells per hour in controls (p less than 0.001). Patients with CRF have elevated RBC calcium levels mainly related to decreased extrusion and to increased influx. CAPD fails to improve substantially these abnormalities.

  ".W": "Filtration of red blood cells through agarose gels (Sephadex, Sepharose, and Superose) was used to assess red cell deformability and simultaneously obtain fractions of red cells with different properties. The hemoglobin concentration in each fraction was used to define a filtration profile of red cells. It was found that gel filtration was a reproducible process. A gel filtration index (GFI) was derived from the height and the width of the filtration curve at half the maximum height. Osmotically treated red cells, red cells partially hardened with increasing glutaraldehyde concentrations, and mixtures of normal and hardened red cells were used to test the method. Changes in red cell deformability were sensitively detected by the GFI. The first fractions eluted from the column contained red cells with normal deformability, whereas the later fractions contained primarily less deformable cells with an increased membrane elastic modulus. By repeated filtration of late fractions it was possible to enrich the suspensions with less deformable cells. Patients with chronic renal failure had a decreased filterability; their GFI was 1.04 +/- 0.27 (n = 15) compared with 1.18 +/- 0.17 in controls (n = 20, p less than 0.05). We conclude that gel filtration is useful to detect and isolate abnormal red cell subpopulations. It could be a valuable tool for the investigation of disorders such as sickle cell anemia.\r"

Immunologically naive, immunosuppressed mice infected with a low-passage clinical HSV-1 isolate developed local site lesions, monoplegia, paraplegia, and died within 8 days. Mice that had recovered from a previous HSV-1 infection and were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and then rechallenged with live virus showed no symptoms and survived. Untreated mice that had recovered from infection (primed mice) had high titers of anti-HSV-1 antibody and a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to virus challenge. Cyclophosphamide treatment, but not lethal irradiation, could ablate the DTH response, resulting in a lack of antivirus cell-mediated immunity. Antibody was the only demonstrable protective immune function in the cyclophosphamide-treated animals. This indicates that cell-mediated immunity is not required for protection against HSV-1 challenge in individuals with virus-specific antibody.\r"

The patients reported their smoking habits, use of oral snuff, use of alcohol, physical exercise and heredity for hypertension in a simple questionnaire. GFR was assessed with 51Cr-EDTA-clearance and glomerular hyperfiltration was defined as a value exceeding +2 SD of the age-adjusted normal value. We found a significantly higher prevalence of glomerular hyperfiltration in smokers than in non-smokers (41% vs. 18%), but no increased prevalence in users of oral snuff. In cigarette smokers a multivariate analysis revealed that GFR was positively related to body mass index (BMI), and negatively related to the number of cigarettes smoked per week and the mean blood pressure. In non-smokers GFR was dependent only on age. We conclude that in insulin-treated diabetics glomerular hyperfiltration is related to smoking, and that the GFR in smoking diabetics is directly dependent on the smoke doses. As glomerular hyperfiltration is regarded as a risk factor for diabetic nephropathy, our findings should be relevant to preventive measures in clinical work.\r"

The results were compared with those for a control group (n = 32). There was no tendency to hyperventilate in the patient group, either after discontinuing hyperventilation or during the ensuing relaxation period. PETCO2 measurements during this time thus showed no significant differences between the patient group and the control group. During the HVPT, 44% of patients reported three or more listed symptoms familiar to them from earlier occasions and regarded as typical of hyperventilation, compared to 23% of the controls (P less than 0.05). In a previously reported study, 38% of the patients were found to have similar symptoms during standardized mental stress, despite lack of hypocapnia. It is concluded that, on the basis of PETCO2 measurements, there were no signs of abnormal hyperventilation in the patient group. Moreover, the HVPT did not appear to be specific for diagnosis of hyperventilation syndrome, since mental stress itself was able to reproduce symptoms without concomitant hypocapnia, and since the provocation test was 'positive' in many control subjects.\r"

We here present the results of a 2-year follow-up investigation, which includes 40 patients with subclinical thyrotoxicosis and 40 euthyroid control patients. The group with subclinical thyrotoxicosis was characterized by a mean age of 65 years and a high prevalence of nodular goitre. Twelve (30%) of the patients but none of the individuals in the control group were treated during the follow-up period because of clinical thyroid disease. Atrial fibrillation was found in 11 (28%) patients compared to four (10%) of the controls. Therapy should be considered more often than previously in patients with nodular goitre and subclinical thyrotoxicosis, particularly in conjunction with atrial fibrillation.\r"

The blood samples were taken after a 40-min standardized whole body cooling test. The mean s-Mg level in the group with RP was significantly lower than in the controls (0.81 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.07 mmol l-1, P less than 0.05). One year later, 66 members of the RP group and 22 members of the control group were investigated further, but without any exposure to cold. No differences in mean s-Mg values were found between the groups. The mean s-Mg level was significantly higher in the blood samples taken later without cold exposure than at the initial examinations after exposure to cold in the RP group, but not in the controls. The s-Mg level was lower after exposure to cold in 82% of the women with RP, compared to 45% of the controls (P less than 0.001). No differences in the other electrolytes were found. It is concluded that exposure to cold under standardized conditions may decrease the s-Mg level in women with primary RP. Further studies of the role of magnesium in patients with RP are required.\r"

The event rate from ischaemic cardiovascular disease was lower among non-consenters than among participants (49.3% vs. 74.8%), as was the rate of death during the first year of follow-up. In conclusion, the differing mortality and dissimilar patterns of specific causes of death in non-consenters and placebo-treated participants emphasize the need for caution in extrapolation of treatment effects to the non-consenting group.

The activity of salt resistant lipase in postheparin plasma was elevated in two of the patients, indicating that the high enzyme activity in adrenal cortex may originate from the liver. Lipoprotein lipase activity in postheparin plasma was clearly depressed in all patients with Cushing's disease and was associated with moderate hypertriglyceridaemia and slightly lowered HDL cholesterol levels. Thus high ACTH and/or corticosteroid levels appear to affect lipoprotein metabolism by a number of mechanisms.\r"

Five consecutive groups of 33 patients received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF); fluorouracil, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cyclophosphamide (FAC); or fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC). The regimens for the five groups were as follows: group 1, three cycles of CMF; group 2, four cycles of CMF; group 3, three cycles of FAC; group 4, four cycles of FAC; and group 5, three cycles of FEC. In response to primary chemotherapy, 157 of the 161 assessable patients showed measurable tumor shrinkage; progressive disease was documented in four. Tumor shrinkage to less than 3 cm was documented in 127 (81%) of the 157 women subjected to surgery, thus allowing a breast-saving procedure, rather than modified radical mastectomy, in these 127 women. Histopathologic complete remission was documented in seven patients. Tumor response was unrelated to age, menopausal status, DNA content (ploidy), [3H]thymidine-labeling index, drug combination used, or number of treatment cycles in excess of three. The degree of response was inversely proportional to the initial tumor size, and the frequency of response was greater in receptor-negative tumors. Severe vomiting and hair loss were less frequent with CMF than with anthracycline-containing regimens, and the frequency of severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia was minimal. Our results challenge the classical indication for primary mastectomy by showing that use of full-dose primary chemotherapy, sequentially combined with conservative surgery and radiation, can offer an effective and safe alternative to women concerned about the preservation of body integrity.\r"

  ".W": "The breast cancer incidence rate (i.e., the detected number of new cases per 100,000 women) increased by 31% in western Washington State between the time periods 1974-1978 and 1986-1987. If this increase is largely due to earlier detection of cases through mammography, it is encouraging; otherwise (if it cannot be attributed to mammography alone), investigation of other factors may be needed. The observed increase, based on 18,559 documented breast cancer cases from the Seattle-Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry, was compared with the predicted increase based on mammography utilization by year from a survey of 1,212 women in western Washington and on data from published studies regarding the impact of mammography on the detection rate for new breast cancer cases. Among women aged 45-64, all of the increase was associated with local stage disease and with tumors detected at a smaller size. Further, the 15% observed increase in incidence in this age group was less than the 20% increase predicted due to the utilization of mammography. However, the observed increase was approximately twice the predicted increase for women aged 65-74 (observed 57%, predicted 26%) and for women aged 25-44 (observed 29%, predicted 12%). Thus, all of the increase in detected breast cancer among 45-64 year old women appears to be explained by the increased use of mammography, while among older women and younger women there may be other contributing factors. The limitations and implications of this analysis are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90383880\r", 
  ".W": "HT1080/DR4 (DR4) is a doxorubicin-resistant human fibrosarcoma line that exhibits 150-fold cross-resistance to etoposide but does not overexpress P-glycoprotein (one mechanism of multiple drug resistance). We examined another possible mechanism that could explain resistance to both doxorubicin and etoposide: a quantitative or qualitative alteration in topoisomerase II, the putative nuclear target of these agents. The amount of immunoreactive topoisomerase II present in whole-cell lysates and nuclear extracts was three- to 10-fold lower in DR4 than in HT1080 cells. However, the topoisomerase II in nuclear extracts from both lines was sensitive to the effects of amsacrine (AMSA) and etoposide. Following treatment with AMSA, etoposide, and 5-iminodaunorubicin, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage in DR4 cells and nuclei was reduced compared with cleavage in HT1080 parent cells and nuclei. The difference between the HT1080 and DR4 lines in AMSA- and 5-iminodaunorubicin-induced cleavage was similar in cells and nuclei and could be due to the lower amount of DR4 topoisomerase II. By contrast, the difference between the HT1080 and DR4 lines in etoposide-induced DNA cleavage was much greater in cells than in nuclei. This finding suggested that cytosolic factors, removed from isolated nuclei, could influence the susceptibility of intact cells to the cytotoxic and DNA-cleaving actions of etoposide. The specific activities of several antioxidant enzymes, components of the cell's defense against free-radical damage that may be produced by doxorubicin or etoposide, were significantly different in HT1080 and DR4 cytosolic extracts. These differences may constitute an additional mechanism of resistance. Regardless, the magnitude of the resistance of DR4 to doxorubicin and etoposide cannot be explained solely on the basis of a topoisomerase II-related mechanism.\r"

While illudins are toxic to most tumor cells after prolonged exposure (greater than or equal to 48 hr), with shorter exposure times (less than or equal to 2 hr), they show selective toxicity for human myelocytic leukemia and epidermoid, lung, ovarian, and breast carcinoma cells of various species of origin. The apparent histologic specificity of illudin S toxicity is based on an energy-dependent transport mechanism present in sensitive cells, but absent in cells relatively resistant to illudin S. For human myeloid leukemia HL60 cells, the Michaelis constant was 4.2 microM and the maximum velocity was 12.2 pmol/minute per 10 million cells or 730 pmol/hour per 10 million cells. The energy-dependent transport mechanism was detected in other mammalian tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "Despite recent gains in admission to medical school and in obtaining junior faculty positions, women remain underrepresented at senior academic ranks and in leadership positions in medicine. This discrepancy has been interpreted as evidence of a \"glass ceiling\" that prevents all but a few exceptional women from gaining access to leadership positions. We analyzed data from Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY, for all faculty hired from 1969 through 1988 and found that the likelihood of promotion on the tenure track was 0.40 for women and 0.48 for men (ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 1.20); on the clinical track the likelihood of promotion was 0.75 for women and 0.72 for men (ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 1.94). Additional analysis of current faculty showed that in the academic year 1988-1989 the proportion of women at each tenure track rank at the College of Physicians & Surgeons equaled or exceeded the national proportion of women graduating from medical school, once allowance was made for the average time lag necessary to attain each rank. On the clinical track women were somewhat overrepresented, particularly at the junior rank. National data that describe medical school faculty, which combine tenure and clinical tracks, showed that in 1988 women were proportionately represented at each rank once the lead time from graduation was considered. We conclude that objective evidence shows that women can succeed and are succeeding in gaining promotions in academic medicine.\r"

Whether this cost-lowering effect persists after discharge was assessed for 203 patients who received cadaver kidneys at the University of California, San Francisco, between July 1982 and June 1986. During the transplantation hospitalization period, cyclosporine was associated with significantly better graft survival (88.7% vs 71.0%) and lower (standardized) costs ($37,174 vs $52,983). Following discharge, however, there were no significant differences in graft survival, total charges ($29,716 vs $34,434), the number of readmissions, the total number of days hospitalized, or physician charges, although cyclosporine was associated with higher drug costs ($3885 vs $373). The results suggest that the initial association of cyclosporine with lower costs diminished substantially over time. For grafts that survive beyond several months, there may be little additional cost-reducing benefits of cyclosporine.\r"

All patients in group A were in cardiorespiratory arrest. None could be successfully resuscitated despite effective rewarming by cardiopulmonary bypass or peritoneal lavage. In contrast, all of the patients in group B recovered from hypothermia, including two in cardiorespiratory arrest. Thus, extreme hyperkalemia during acute hypothermia appears to be a reliable marker of death. It might be used to select those patients in whom heroic resuscitation efforts can be useful.\r"

  ".W": "Despite provision of adequate calories, defined formula diets in rats lead to bacterial translocation (BT), fatty infiltration of the liver, and an increased susceptibility to endotoxin. These deleterious effects may be due in part to a loss of intestinal barrier integrity resulting from bowel atrophy. Defined formula diets lack both glutamine and fiber, substances which may help maintain intestinal mass. To determine whether supplementation of defined formula diets with either glutamine or fiber might prevent bowel atrophy and, thus, BT, hepatic steatosis, and the altered response to endotoxin, Wistar rats were fed (1) defined formula diet ad libitum (DFD), (2) (DFD + 2% (w/v) glutamine, (GLUT), or (3) DFD + 2% (w/v) psyllium (FIBER). Rats given standard food isocalorically pair-fed to DFD were used as controls. Nutritional status was assessed by daily weight gain, as well as the ability to maintain serum albumin, hematocrit and white blood counts. After 2 weeks of these feeding regimens, animals were sacrificed, and organ weights and composition were determined, with rates of bacterial translocation determined by mesenteric lymph node, abdominal viscera, and cecal cultures. Additional animals receiving the same experimental diets were subsequently challenged with endotoxin and observed for mortality with rates of post-endotoxin BT and the responses of acute phase proteins and cytokines measured. All dietary regimens resulted in equivalent weight gain and other nutritional parameters. Both glutamine and fiber supplementation maintained small bowel mass, but only GLUT preserved normal jejunal mucosal architecture. Neither fiber nor glutamine supplementation prevented cecal bacterial overgrowth or BT, resulting from the DFD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At the end of two weeks feeding of the experimental diets, mice were challenged with Ps. aeruginosa intraperitoneally and mortality was recorded over one week. No significant differences in survival among groups fed different levels of protein were seen. Similarly, type of protein used did not affect outcome. We conclude that overall two-week manipulation of dietary protein did not significantly affect outcome from infection in this model.\r"

No effect of cholesterol was observed on any of the measurements and no effect of taurine was observed on any of the biochemical measures with the exception that taurine concentrations in plasma and urine (reduced in infants fed formula alone) were corrected to concentrations observed in breastfed infants. Taurine supplementation had no effect on the rate of weight gain or on linear growth over the complete course of the study. Thus, taurine supplementation of formulas returns plasma and urine concentrations of this amino acid to those found in human milk-fed infants. However, these data indicate that the supplementation of formulas with taurine has no benefit with respect to growth.\r"

Delayed pneumothorax required treatment with tube thoracostomy more frequently than immediate pneumothorax.

  ".W": "Glutamine is an important amino acid because of its key role in the transfer of both carbon and nitrogen between tissues in the body. Specific tissues are usually associated with either net synthesis or net utilization of glutamine, but the liver plays a central role in glutamine homeostasis, in that it can shift to function in either capacity. This capability, along with the localization of urea biosynthesis in the periportal hepatocytes, focuses attention on the transport mechanisms in hepatocytes for uptake and release of glutamine. Active transport of glutamine by hepatocytes is mediated by a Na(+)-dependent activity termed system N, which exhibits a rather narrow substrate specificity mediating uptake of histidine and asparagine as well as of glutamine. This secondary active transport system allows for the net accumulation of glutamine against a concentration gradient and maintenance of intracellular concentrations of glutamine between 4 and 8 mM in the face of a plasma concentration of 0.6 mM. Utilization of the Na+ electrochemical gradient as a driving force ensures that the system N carrier catalyzes a unidirectional transport event favoring the cytoplasm. It is obvious from the glutamine gradient across the plasma membrane that efflux of this amino acid is typically slower than accumulation; measurement of saturable, Na(+)-independent glutamine transport by system L substantiates this proposal. However, it is clear that under certain metabolic conditions the liver represents a source of glutamine for other tissues in the body and net efflux must occur. The system N transport activity in hepatocytes is regulated by hormones such as insulin, glucagon, and glucocorticoids, as demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have characterized taurine transport into confluent monolayers of two continuous renal epithelial cell lines: LLC-PK1, a cell of porcine proximal tubular origin, and the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell line (MDCK) of distal origin. Taurine uptake is linear up to 90 minutes in LLC-PK1 cells and 180 minutes in MDCK cells. This process is highly dependent upon Na+ as the cation and either Cl- or Br- as the anion. Taurine uptake is inhibited by another beta-amino acid, beta-alanine, to a greater extent than the alpha-analog, L-alanine or other alpha-amino acids. Incubation of cell monolayers with taurine-free medium (0 microM taurine) induces an increase in Na(+)-dependent taurine uptake when compared to cells exposed to standard medium (50 microM taurine). When cells were incubated in medium containing high taurine (500 microM), uptake was decreased as compared to control cells. This adaptive response is evident by 12 hours in both cell lines and is the result of changes in the apparent transport maximum (Jmax) rather than the apparent Km for taurine. The changes in transport observed after manipulation of medium taurine concentration were not associated with differences in taurine efflux. In summary, taurine is transported by a beta-specific, Na-Cl dependent process in both renal epithelial cell lines. Although the factors which regulate taurine transport are not known, an increased transport maximum is observed in cells which have been taurine-starved, and a decreased Jmax is seen in cells supplied with excess taurine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined the interaction between dietary protein and the renin-angiotensin system in subtotally nephrectomized rats (1-2/3 nephrectomy). No difference was seen in tissue renin activity in rats ingesting a high (30%) versus a low (6%) protein diet. To determine the pathophysiological role of angiotensin II in subtotally nephrectomized rats, we examined the acute renal response to an intrarenal infusion of the angiotensin II antagonist Sar1 Gly8-angiotensin II (10 micrograms/kg/min). Only those subtotally nephrectomized animals ingesting a high protein diet exhibited a consistent improvement in glomerular permselectivity, as manifested by a 24% fall in the fractional clearance of albumin (basal 16.19 +/- 3.65 x 10(-4) vs. Sar1 Gly8-AII 12.26 +/- 3.21 x 10(-4); P less than 0.02) and a 19% fall in the fractional clearance of IgG (basal 3.75 +/- 0.67 x 10(-4) vs. Sar1 Gly8-AII 3.03 +/- 0.48 x 10(-4); P less than 0.02). No consistent change occurred in glomerular permselectivity in the rats on the low protein diet or rats infused with vehicle only. No change in mean arterial pressure or whole-kidney hemodynamics were seen with angiotensin II blockade. Decrements in SNGFR and glomerular capillary pressure occurred with angiotensin blockade in the animals ingesting the high protein diet, suggesting hemodynamic factors as a mechanism for the improvement in permselective defects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Monocytes, T cells, fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells secrete IL-6. Since IL-6 responsive cell-types may participate in the pathogenesis of glomerular inflammation, we studied the secretion of IL-6 by rat MCs, using the IL-6 dependent hybridoma cell line B9. The results of our studies indicate that MCs secrete IL-6 with a molecular weight of 17-42 kDa and isoelectric point of 4.0 to 5.3 MC-IL-6 activity could be blocked by a polyclonal antimurine-IL-6 antibody. MC express IL-6 mRNA as determined by Northern blot. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that IL-6 acts as an autocrine growth factor for MC. Incubation of subconfluent MC with recombinant IL-6 results in a dose-dependent increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation and number of MCs. Moreover, reverse phase HPLC fractions of MC-CM containing IL-6 activity increase 3H-thymidine incorporation by MC. In addition to its possible paracrine role in mediating the immune response in the glomerulus, MC-IL-6 may also be one of the autocrine signals leading to mesangial cell proliferation in vivo.\r"

The present study was performed to localize the nephron segment(s) involved in the restoration of the phosphaturic effect of PTH by propranolol infusion in respiratory alkalotic rats. PTH infusion increased the fractional delivery of phosphate (FDPi) to the late proximal tubule to similar levels in the propranolol and vehicle-infused respiratory alkalotic rats (FDPi 46.6 +/- 4.4% and 48.6 +/- 4.2%, respectively). In contrast, PTH only increased FDPi to the early distal tubules (to 17.1 +/- 0.9%) in the absence of propranolol compared to FDPi 41.9 +/- 2.5% in the presence of propranolol in respiratory alkalotic animals. We conclude that the restoration of the phosphaturic effect of PTH in respiratory alkalotic rats by propranolol infusion is due primarily to decreased reabsorption of phosphate by the straight segment of the proximal tubule.\r"

A surface coil of 14 cm diameter was used for acquiring phosphorus signals solely from a volume-of-interest located within the kidney. To determine the effects of kidney transplantation on renal metabolism, patients with well functioning allografts were studied. Little or no phosphocreatine in all spectra verifies the absence of muscle contamination, and is consistent with proper volume localization. The intensity ratio of phosphomonoesters (PME) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) resonances in transplanted kidneys (PME/ATP = 1.1 +/- 0.4) was slightly elevated (P = 0.2) compared to that of healthy normal kidneys (PME/ATP = 0.8 +/- 0.3). The inorganic phosphate (Pi) to ATP ratio was similar in the two groups (Pi/ATP = 1.1 +/- 0.1 in transplanted kidneys vs. 1.2 +/- 0.6 in normal kidneys). Acid/base status, as evidenced from the chemical shift of Pi, was the same in both normal controls and transplanted kidneys. Despite the practical problems produced by organ depth, respiratory movement, and tissue heterogeneity, these results demonstrate that image-guided 31P MR spectra can reliably be obtained from human kidneys.\r"

In 10 patients, after intravenous infusion of either 5% or 2.5% NaCl (6 mEq per kg body wt for 120 minutes in both solutions), the maximum increase in plasma potassium averaged 0.6 (range 0.3 to 1.3) mmol/liter (P less than 0.01) or 0.3 (range 0.2 to 0.6) mmol/liter (P less than 0.01), respectively. The rise of both plasma potassium and osmolality was significantly higher during 5% NaCl than during 2.5% NaCl infusion (P less than 0.01). A significant linear correlation (P less than 0.01) between plasma potassium and osmolality was observed. Urinary potassium excretion was increased to a similar extent by 5% NaCl and 2.5% NaCl infusion. The observed hyperkalemia, secondary to NaCl infusion, was independent of venous pH, plasma bicarbonate, anion gap, insulin levels, and urinary norepinephrine and epinephrine excretion, and was associated with a fall in plasma aldosterone concentration. In separate studies, nine patients were treated with desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA; 20 mg i.m. for three days) before receiving saline (5%) infusion. DOCA did not prevent the level increase in plasma potassium that remained significantly correlated with plasma osmolality (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, hypertonic NaCl infusion in patients with renal failure causes a clinically relevant hyperkalemia despite increased renal excretion of potassium. This hyperkalemia is independent of acid-base or hormonal mechanisms known to regulate extrarenal homeostasis of potassium, and is strictly correlated with a rise in plasma osmolality.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was performed to investigate the effects of dietary fish oil supplements on renal function and renal prostaglandin (PG) E metabolism. The usual \"western\" diet of 10 healthy volunteers (six female and 4 male) aged between 21 and 35 years was supplemented with 6 g/day of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [3.6 g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 2.4 g of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] for six weeks. Supine arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), renal hemodynamics, renal excretory function and urinary excretion of PGE2 and PGE3 were determined before and at the end of the fish oil supplementation period. No changes could be observed in BP and HR while renal plasma flow (RPF), determined as the clearance of PAH, significantly increased from 559 +/- 44 to 738 +/- 47 ml/min (P less than 0.001) with the fish oil supplements. This was associated with a decrease in renal vascular resistance from (8.11 +/- 0.54).10(-2) to (6.37 +/- 0.38).10(-2) mm Hg.min.ml-1 (P less than 0.01). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), determined as the clearance of inulin, increased from 97 +/- 3 to 107 +/- 3 ml/min (P less than 0.01), resulting in a decrease in filtration fraction from an average of 0.19 +/- 0.01 to 0.15 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Much evidence suggests that primary IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MN) are immune complex mediated diseases. Moreover, genetic factors may play an important role in their pathogenesis. Recently, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes have been described which appear to associate with glomerulonephritis. We have studied RFLPs of the switch region of the IgM (S mu) and IgA1 (S alpha 1) heavy chain in MN and IgAN. DNA obtained from British Caucasoids with IgAN (N = 75), MN (N = 43), and normal controls (N = 73), was digested with the restriction enzyme Sac1, and studied using Southern blot techniques and hybridization with a 32P labelled DNA probe homologous to S mu. This probe detects RFLPs at the S mu and S alpha 1 loci. The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the S mu and S alpha 1 alleles in IgAN and MN was similar to normal controls. Caucasoid subjects with IgAN from Northern and Southern Europe (Finland and Italy, respectively) were also studied to determine whether an ethnic variation in genetic susceptibility to IgAN exists. The frequency of the S mu and S alpha 1 alleles was similar between the patient groups and their respective local healthy controls. These results do not support the recent findings of an association with RFLPs of the S mu and S alpha 1 loci in IgAN and MN, and suggest that the immunoglobulin heavy chain switch region genes are not important in conferring disease susceptibility to IgAN or MN.\r"

Fistulograms were performed on 22 out of 25 patients with greater than 0.15 fractional recirculation at a 400 ml/minute blood pump setting. Clinically significant abnormalities were found in 82% (N = 18) and treated in 17. Two patients had second episodes of elevated recirculations and were treated again within the period of follow-up. Treatment with angioplasty (N = 11) or surgical revision (N = 8) resulted in a fall in recirculation from 0.33 +/- 0.04 to 0.12 +/- 0.02 (P = 0.001). The fractional reduction of urea clearance due to recirculation fell from 0.20 +/- 0.03 to 0.08 +/- 0.02 (P = 0.001) and the effective urea clearance of the dialysis treatment rose by 16% from 193 +/- 7 ml/min to 224 +/- 6 ml/min (P = 0.001). Pre-dialysis BUN fell from 72 +/- 4 mg/100 ml to 62 +/- 3 mg/100 ml (P = 0.012).

Venous pressures in 20 of the patients in our dialysis unit with recirculations of less than 0.10 were 201 +/- 6 mm Hg (P = NS compared to patients with recirculation greater than or equal to 0.15 at 400 ml/min blood flow).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A population-based prevalence cohort of 1,111 residents of Rochester, Minnesota, who had diabetes mellitus on Jan. 1, 1975, was subjected to follow-up assessment for hospitalizations through Dec. 31, 1980. On the basis of these data, hospitalization rates were calculated for various clinical types of diabetes, and a risk factor analysis was done for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) to identify high-risk persons for subsequent intervention studies. The adjusted incidence density of hospitalization was 141.6 per 1,000 person-years for NIDDM and 331.3 per 1,000 person-years for insulin-dependent diabetes. Although the modeled clinical characteristics accounted for little variability in NIDDM-related hospitalization, age modified by the effect of gender was the strongest risk factor found (multivariate hazard ratios: 1.0 and 1.43, respectively, for male and female patients younger than 65 years old; 1.88 and 1.83, respectively, for male and female patients 65 years old or older); coronary heart disease, diabetic retinopathy, and persistent proteinuria were associated with a 50% increased risk. Although older patients with NIDDM (especially men) are at greatest risk for a first hospitalization, clinical factors alone seem inadequate to account for these hospitalizations. The effect of Medicare's prospective payment systems (PPS) was studied by using a data base for Olmsted County, Minnesota, to determine whether PPS decreased the rate of hospitalizations among patients with diabetes. Among Olmsted County residents 65 years of age or older, the adjusted rate of diabetes-associated hospitalizations decreased from 26.5 per 1,000 person-years in 1980 to 16.7 in 1985, whereas the adjusted rate of all other hospitalizations increased from 259.5 per 1,000 person-years to 261.9. Thus, PPS may have reduced hospitalization rates in elderly patients with diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "During the 11-year period 1975 through 1985, 1,063 surgical procedures were performed on 795 Mayo Clinic patients 90 years of age or older. Preoperative conditions, surgical setting, and perioperative morbidity and mortality were analyzed in a comparison of the local residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (N = 224), with patients from outside the county but within 250 miles (N = 456) or referrals from a distance of 250 miles or further (N = 115). In comparison with non-Olmsted County patients, Olmsted County patients were generally older, had more preoperative chronic diseases, and underwent more emergency operations. Patients who had traveled 250 miles or more to the Mayo Clinic were more likely to be men and referred for cancer-related surgical procedures. The risks of major morbidity and mortality within 48 hours postoperatively were increased in patients with more preoperative chronic diseases and those undergoing emergency procedures, characteristics most common in Olmsted County patients. Because of differences in these factors between groups, perioperative risks averaged over our entire patient series underestimated risks that would be expected from a population-based cohort such as Olmsted County residents. In general, data from tertiary medical centers probably do not accurately reflect overall practice or outcomes in community settings.\r"

  ".W": "We identified all residents of Rochester, Minnesota, who sought medical assistance for the first time in 1985 because of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the hip or knee that was unrelated to a specific disease. Of these residents, 98 (59 women and 39 men) had 122 symptomatic joints (95 knees and 27 hips), for age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates of 205 new patients and 255 newly affected joints per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of osteoarthritis of the hip was greater in women than in men, whereas the sex ratio for occurrence of osteoarthritis of the knee approached unity. Rates at both sites increased steadily with aging in men but plateaued after the menopause in women; similar patterns were seen whether or not grade 1 disease was included. Projected nationally, these first population-based data indicate that as many as approximately half a million new symptomatic cases of idiopathic osteoarthritis of the knee and hip may arise annually in the white population of the United States. With increasing longevity, osteoarthritis may exact an even greater toll in the future.\r"

Herein we describe such a patient, in whom serial tomographic imaging with a new radiopharmaceutical agent, technetium-99m sestamibi, was useful in demonstrating a large area of myocardium at risk and subsequent substantial benefit from acute reperfusion therapy. Because this perfusion agent washes out slowly from the myocardium, imaging can be delayed for several hours; thus, acute reperfusion therapy can be performed without delay. Subsequent imaging, however, will reflect myocardial perfusion at the time of administration of the radionuclide. Additional studies with this agent may be valuable in identifying those patients with ST-segment depression who will benefit from acute reperfusion therapy.\r"

The high frequency of loss of heterozygosity on 17p was confirmed, and a third of informative tumours had also lost an allele at the long arm locus THH59. On the short arm two distinct regions of loss of heterozygosity were identified, in bands p13-3 and p13-1. The latter probably involves the structural gene p53, which has been implicated as an oncogene or as a tumour suppressor in various human cancers. 17p 13-3, however, showed a significantly higher frequency of loss of heterozygosity, and there was no correlation between allele losses at the two sites. Nevertheless, loss of heterozygosity at 17p 13-3 is associated with overexpression of p53 mRNA, suggesting the existence of a gene some 20 megabases telomeric of p53 that regulates its expression. Lesions of this regulatory gene seem to be involved in the majority of breast cancers.\r"

There were 3 deaths. Age and dose seemed to be related to occurrence of agranulocytosis. The frequency of the complication seemed to be higher than that reported for other countries, perhaps because higher doses were prescribed in New Zealand but also perhaps because of a selection bias in surveys elsewhere. The occurrence of agranulocytosis with mianserin in New Zealand is higher than that of white-cell dyscrasias reported with use of chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone, and oxyphenbutazone, and although the case-fatality rate of agranulocytosis is lower with mianserin than with the other drugs, the overall mortality rate may be higher.\r"
