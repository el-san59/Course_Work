To address the safety and clinical usefulness of endometrial sampling, a chart review of 310 endometrial sampling procedures performed by practicing family physicians was undertaken. Cases were identified by billing records and chart auditing to assure complete recording of all procedures performed by study practitioners since the beginning of their practices. A prestudy survey revealed that 26% of rural family physicians and none of the urban family physicians in western New York were doing endometrial sampling. Practitioners were doing an average of 1.2 per month. Of the 310 procedures 14.5% were unsuccessful because of cervical stenosis or inadequate sample. There were no reported complications, and three cases of endometrial carcinoma were discovered. Endometrial sampling is safe and clinically useful when performed by family physicians.\r"

Forty-seven percent of family physicians and 41.9% of the internists who were still in practice returned the questionnaire. When asked about their choice of antihypertensive drug therapy for specific patients (based upon age, race, sex, and coexisting disease), the responses of the two specialties were similar. The only statistically significant difference was observed in the responses for a 58-year-old obese white woman with diabetes and renal impairment. In this example, the family physicians were more likely than internists to recommend an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or a beta-blocker (P = .036). This study demonstrates that the majority of physicians individualized initial therapy for hypertension to the specific patient rather than strictly following a stepped-care approach with diuretics or beta-blockers as initial therapy.\r"

These reminders, however, are often costly to maintain and modify. This study investigates the influence of a microcomputer tickler system on the ordering of mammograms. All women (N = 1262) aged 40 years and older who made visits to an outpatient office during a 6-month period were randomly assigned to one of two groups. For the experimental group, the date of the last mammogram ordered and recorded in the clinical database was printed on the encounter form generated for each patient visit. No information regarding previous mammograms was printed for patients in the control group. Women in the experimental group were more likely to have a mammogram ordered during the study period (19% compared with 12%, P = .001) and, as a result, were more likely to be in compliance with mammography guidelines at the study's completion (27% compared with 21%, P = .011). Microcomputerized data storage and retrieval systems may help increase physicians' attention to preventive health screening recommendations.\r"

Nevertheless, 55% of the physicians rated mammography as a very effective breast-screening procedure; 28% rated breast self-examination and 16% rated clinical breast examination as very effective. Three fourths of the physicians showed great interest in learning more about breast palpation, breast self-examination instruction, and mammography. Individual instruction in the office was preferred over a group workshop format, and a trained nonphysician health professional was considered as acceptable as a physician to provide the instruction. Results suggest that breast cancer screening education for family physicians is a high priority, and that physicians will welcome such training, particularly if it is office-based.\r"

To determine which specialists provide this family care, a subset of families (N = 447) enrolled in the Rand Health Insurance Experiment were examined. Among families designating a single primary care physician, family physicians and general practitioners provided 65.9% to 89.7% of their family care. Internists provided 20.0% and 27.3% of family care for younger and older couples, respectively. The remaining specialties, including pediatrics and obstetrics-gynecology, each provided less than 5% of family care; these small proportions of family care may reflect the specialists' self-imposed limits in primary care roles. As family members matured, families used fewer pediatricians and obstetrician-gynecologists for primary care and concurrently increased their use of family physicians or general practitioners. Care for intact families is provided predominantly by family physicians or general practitioners, although in families without children, internists also play an important role. Self-defined limits in primary care roles by physicians in various specialties and the changing use of specialties during the family life cycle largely determined which specialties provided family care.\r"

Two pure types closely resemble the DSM-III portrait of ASPD. Two other pure types consisted of alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms and indicators of illicit drug use for recreational purposes. Only two of the symptomatic pure types were common among women. The first of these was characterized by marital instability, other domestic problems, and employment difficulties; as such this type resembles the DSM-III description of borderline and/or histrionic personality disorder. The other female pure type was characterized by multiple symptoms of depression and selected symptoms of other axis I disorders. The final pure type was characterized by an absence of psychiatric symptoms and served as a comparison group against which the symptomatic pure types were compared.\r"

We normalized the diurnal weight gain (NDWG) as a percentage by subtracting the 7 a.m. weight from 4 p.m. weight, multiplying the difference by 100, and then dividing the result by the 7 a.m. weight. NDWG was .509% +/- .337%, 2.209% +/- 1.529%, .631% +/- .405%, and .533% +/- .410%, among the geriatric men, nongeriatric men, control subjects, and normal subjects respectively.

Severely traumatized Cambodian refugee patients (N = 68) who suffered from chronic PTSD and major depression improved symptomatically when treated with a combination of clonidine and imipramine. A prospective pilot study of nine patients using this combination of an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist and a tricyclic antidepressant resulted in improved symptoms of depression in six patients, five to the point that DSM-III-R diagnoses were no longer met. The average decrease in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score was 16. PTSD global symptoms improved in six patients but only in two to the point that DSM-III-R diagnoses were not met. There was no further sleep disorder in five and the frequency of nightmares lessened in seven patients. Startle reaction improved only in four patients; avoidance behavior showed little improvement in any of the nine. The imipramine-clonidine combination was well tolerated and presents a promising treatment for severely depressed and traumatized patients, although further studies are needed.\r"

A detailed investigation of all network television suicide news stories broadcast between January 1, 1973, and December 31, 1984, was undertaken to resolve this inconsistency. The information about television coverage of suicides was more comprehensive than in previous studies. The analyses show that there was no reliable association between news stories and suicides among adults at any time over the 12 years investigated. A reliable association existed among teenagers between 1973 and 1980. This association reversed in 1981, however, and the relative risk of suicide associated with network news stories was consistently less than 1.0 through the end of the study period.\r"

Concern that this policy risked misdiagnosing a benign tumour prompted us to examine the accuracy of CT scanning in diagnosing malignant lesions. The study was designed to determine whether within a group of 300 patients with intracerebral mass lesions of known pathology, two sub-groups existed: one with appearances so specific for malignant glioma that biopsy was unnecessary, and the other in which the appearances were characteristic of malignancy, though not specific for glioma. Three neuroradiologists independently reviewed the CT scans, together with brief clinical details. When diagnosing malignant tumours, all made errors: nine benign lesions were considered to be malignant. When diagnosing malignant glioma, one neuroradiologist made errors, but the other two adopted a more cautious approach and were accurate. The restricted a \"certain\" diagnosis to about one in five scans considered to show malignant tumour. Those diagnosed specifically as malignant glioma were intrinsic, irregular, mixed density lesions, exhibiting variable enhancement and infiltrating the peri-ventricular tissues, especially the corpus callosum. Using these criteria, they could correctly identify a small proportion of patients with malignant gliomas. In all other patients, biopsy remains the only means of obtaining a definitive diagnosis.\r"

The CSF findings were therefore reviewed of 111 patients with a proven SAH. All patients had xanthochromia of the CSF. Lumbar punctures were performed between 12 hours and one week after the ictus. Xanthochromia was still present in all (41) patients after 1 week, in all (32) patients after 2 weeks, in 20 of 22 patients after three weeks and in 10 of 14 patients after four weeks. In six years we identified only 12 patients with sudden headache, normal CT, bloodstained CSF, and no xanthochromia. Angiography was carried out in three and was negative. All 12 patients survived without disability and were not re-admitted with a SAH (mean follow up 4 years). It is concluded that it is still xanthochromia that is important in the diagnosis of SAH and not bloodstained CSF. Furthermore a normal CT scan and the absence of xanthochromia do exclude a ruptured aneurysm, provided xanthochromia is investigated by spectrophotometry and lumbar puncture is carried out between 12 hours and 2 weeks after the ictus.\r"

  ".W": "From January 1981 to June 1986 116 patients with anticoagulation-related intracranial haemorrhage were referred to hospital. Seventy six of these haemorrhages were extracerebral, 69 were in the subdural and seven in the subarachnoid space. No epidural haemorrhages were identified. Compared with non-anticoagulation-related haematomas, the risk of haemorrhage was calculated to be increased fourfold in men and thirteenfold in women. An acute subdural haematoma, mostly due to contusion, was more frequently accompanied by an additional intracerebral haematoma than a chronic subdural haematoma. Trauma was a more important factor in acute subdural haematomas than in chronic. Almost half of the patients (48%) had a history of hypertension, more than a third (35%) had heart disease and about one fifth (18%) were diabetic. Headache was the most frequent initial symptom. Later decreased level of consciousness and focal neurological signs exceeded the frequency of headache. Three patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage and nine patients with acute subdural haematomas died, while those with chronic subdural haematomas all survived and had at the most mild, non-disabling sequelae. Myocardial infarction (22%), pulmonary embolism (20%), and arterial disease (20%) were the most frequent reasons for anticoagulant treatment. Critical review based on established criteria for anticoagulation treatment suggests there was no medical reason to treat a third of these patients. The single most useful measure that could be taken to reduce the risk of anticoagulation-induced intracranial haemorrhage would be to identify patients who are being unnecessarily treated and to discontinue anticoagulants.\r"

Descriptions of rear-end automobile accidents were presented to two groups. One group (n = 22) rated the likelihood of a variety of physical, affective, cognitive, and distractor (never or rarely reported by trauma victims) symptoms. A second group (n = 21) judged the speed necessary to cause each of the symptoms. The results indicated that highly exaggerated speeds were thought necessary to produce even the most common physical symptoms. Moreover, cognitive symptoms were thought to be no more likely than were distractor symptoms. In contrast, the knowledge about physical symptoms, the effects of loss of consciousness and whiplash versus direct head injuries was consistent with what is known from research literature.\r"

Seventeen patients were matched for age and sex with one hospitalised and two general population controls. Among the risk factors considered we found a significant statistical association between VEGAS and hypertension (odds ratio = 3.14; p = 0.032), ischaemic heart disease (odds ratio = 4.20; p = 0.013), ECG ischaemic changes (odds ratio = 3.67; p = 0.029), low HDL-cholesterol levels (odds ratio = 3.75; p = 0.028) and diabetes (odds ratio = 6.00; p = 0.018).

If the disease runs a milder course in children, the problems experienced with PE might outweight the benefit. In order to evaluate the need for such a specific treatment in children, we compared the severity of the disease between 18 children and 50 adults; no significant differences were found. The mean duration of hospitalisation of all children was 84 days, four children needed artificial ventilation for a mean of 21.5 days and two children died. We conclude therefore that PE is indicated in children with a severe GBS. The final decision, however, depends also on the practical feasibility of the procedure.\r"

Sural nerve and anterior tibial muscle biopsies were performed. A severe but shortlasting impairment of the parasympathetic vagal reflex arc was found.

The neurophysiological variables of somatic nerve function showed signs of a mainly demyelinating mixed sensory/motor neuropathy. The recovery of these variables was slow.

Although a significant peak of Parkinson births (compared with the age profile of the Aberdeen population in 1983) occurred in 1902, there appeared to be no systematic relationship between Parkinson births and influenza deaths. In addition, no season of birth effect could be detected in a comparison with 232 matched controls. The presence of peaks of birth years, for whatever aetiological reason, is of significance to epidemiological studies in that prevalence estimates may be influenced by the year of study relative to these mini-cohorts.\r"

However, information about the initial stage and the final extent of such remyelination is not available. We describe the morphologic findings of a demyelinating lesion with evidence of early remyelination in a biopsy obtained from a 15-year-old boy about two weeks after the onset of neurologic symptoms. The demyelinated area appeared hypercellular with a relatively large number of oligodendrocytes frequently seen in the process of new myelin formation. In addition to the usual reactive changes, the astrocytes were often seen to contain otherwise normal-looking oligodendrocytes within their cytoplasm. In the ensuing months, the patient made apparently total functional recovery accompanied by nearly complete resolution of the white matter lesions demonstrated by the subsequent magnetic resonance studies. These observations suggested that the initial remyelination seen in the biopsy eventually succeeded in producing extensive remyelination in the lesion. Although the exact nature of the demyelinating disorder in our patient remains undetermined, this study indicates that clinically significant remyelination is possible in human CNS. Also, our findings appeared strikingly similar to those described in certain experimental animal models in which widespread remyelination is known to occur.\r"

  ".W": "Mice with the autosomal recessive gene \"wasted\" (wst/wst) manifest hindlimb paralysis and tremulousness, develop reduced secretory immune responses, and have abnormal DNA repair mechanisms. There is prominent vacuolar degeneration of neurons within anterior horns of the spinal cord and motor nuclei of the brainstem. A morphometric analysis of motor neurons in the spinal cord was performed on 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-embedded tissue from ten wst/wst mice, ten littermates (wst/+, +/+) without clinical deficits, and ten parental (+/+) control mice. Vacuolated neurons were present only in wst/wst mice (p = 0.0008). Fibrillary neurons were more numerous in the wst/wst mice than in littermates (p = 0.01) or controls (p = 0.007). The number of total or normal neurons did not differ significantly among the three groups. Volume measurements for normal, fibrillary, vacuolated, and total neurons were greater in wst/wst mice (p less than 0.008). Electron microscopic studies revealed vacuolar degeneration exclusively within neurons of wst/wst mice with the prominent accumulation of neurofilaments. Immunocytochemical staining of Araldite-embedded sections with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to 68 kDa, 160 kDa, and 200 kDa neurofilament proteins showed prominent staining of vacuolated and fibrillary neurons in wst/wst mice exclusively with the MAb to 200 kDa neurofilaments. Dephosphorylation of tissue reduced the staining of 200 kDa neurofilaments in wst/wst mice. These studies suggest that phosphorylated neurofilaments may be important in events producing neuronal dysfunction. Therefore the \"wasted\" mutation may be an excellent model for the study of motor neuron disease.\r"

  ".W": "A rat model was developed to examine changes in the posterior circle of Willis and the basilar and intracranial vertebral arteries after bilateral common carotid ligation. This procedure produced a major redistribution of blood to the head, with increased flow through the vertebral and basilar arteries. Changes in the vertebral, basilar, posterior communicating and proximal segments of the posterior cerebral arteries and neck vessels were assessed by postmortem barium sulfate arteriography and by histology of the middle portion of the basilar arteries serially at four days, and one, two, four and 15 weeks post-ligation. The changes noted were basilar and vertebral artery tortuosity, enlargement, and duplication of the vertebro-basilar junction. By 15 weeks, these intracranial vascular changes had largely regressed toward normal, commensurate with the appearance of multiple collateral vessels which were scattered throughout the soft tissues of the neck and shunted the original ligation sites. A mechanism that could explain these trophic vessel changes in response to increased blood flow is discussed. Some possible correlates of these findings with several brain vascular diseases are presented.\r"

Animals were studied at one, two and seven days after irradiation. Blood-brain barrier damage was detected by the intravenous injection of Evans blue, horseradish peroxidase and heterologous immunoglobulins. At one and two days after irradiation, the lesions were characterized by extravasation of immunoglobulin and Evans blue, and by edema, ischemia and infiltration by monocytes. On the seventh day after irradiation, the lesion was smaller than it had been two days after irradiation, and had reactive changes at its edges and coagulative necrosis at its center. Extravasation of Evans blue and immunoglobulin was markedly reduced by the seventh day after irradiation, but uptake of horseradish peroxidase by macrophages located at the periphery of the lesion was evident.\r"

Standard reference beads containing a known amount of fluorescein were used to calibrate the flow cytometer; however, the intensity of fluorescence from these beads was too weak to allow direct comparison with the fluorescence from the stained cells. Therefore, the flow cytometer was recalibrated using reference beads with a fluorescence intensity similar to that of the glioma cells. By comparing the fluorescence intensities of the two types of reference beads, it was possible to determine the fluorescein content of the stained cells directly from the relative fluorescence intensity (channel number). Glioma cell lines 343 MGA, SF 126, SF 188, U 251, and U 87 had fluorescein concentrations of 72.0 +/- 6.8, 8.1 +/- 0.3, 52.6 +/- 3.1, 86.4 +/- 4.0, and 56.2 +/- 2.9 x 10(5) (mean +/- standard error) Eq Sol Mol (equivalent solution of mole), respectively. The GFAP content of these cell lines, determined by ELISA, was 15.7 +/- 5.2, 0.5 +/- 0.1, 11.1 +/- 2.0, 20.8 +/- 4.6, and 9.5 +/- 2.7 pg GFAP/cell, respectively, and correlated closely with the results of FCM (R = 0.983, p less than 0.0028). A linear regression analysis yielded the following equation: pg GFAP/cell = -2.3376 + 0.2518 x FCM integrated mean channel number (fluorescein concentration: 10(5) Eq Sol Mol).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found no loss in cell number ten or 20 weeks after axotomy. The average size of the neurons in each case is slightly but significantly reduced. These findings unequivocally demonstrate that the somata of long tract neurons of the rubrospinal and corticospinal systems persist in an atrophic and presumably inactive state for at least 20 weeks, and raise the possibility that treatment of spinal cord injury may normalize cell activity and allow long tract regeneration.\r"

SAM-P/8 and SAM-P/8/Ta showed no clinical neurological abnormalities, yet there was a deterioration in learning and memory abilities. Light microscopic examination revealed a spongy degeneration in the brain stem and spinal cord, in the reticular formation, and proliferation of hypertrophic astrocytes in the spongy area. The spongiform degeneration progressed with advancing age from four to eight months, after which the entire brain was involved. Astrocytosis increased with advancing degeneration. Ultrastructurally, mild dendritic swelling occurred at one month of age. At two months of age, moderate postsynaptic swelling and a widening of intracellular membrane structure were observed, and at age five months there were large vacuoles circumscribed by membranous lamellae, identifiable as myelin. Vacuoles in SAM-P/8 proved to be swollen neuronal processes and oligodendroglial processes. These SAM-P/8 and SAM-P/8/Ta strains of mice are new memory-deficient strains with spontaneous spongy degeneration associated with aging.\r"

We compared this device with an automated oscillometric blood pressure monitor (Dinamap 1846SX) in 20 patients during spinal anesthesia for nonemergency cesarean section according to a procedure suggested by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. After administration of the spinal anesthetic, the Finapres monitor produced systolic, mean, and diastolic pressure measurements greater than those of the Dinamap monitor (6.6 +/- 12.5, 3.3 +/- 10.4, and 7.2 +/- 9.8 mm Hg, respectively). In most patients, the Finapres measurements were similar to those determined by the Dinamap; however, in 4 patients, mean systolic differences were greater than 20 mm Hg. These patients did not differ from the others in age, height, weight, or baseline blood pressure, and the pressure values recorded by the Finapres monitor were substantially higher than those measured by auscultation in the labor room. In 30% of the patients, the offset between Dinamap and Finapres blood pressure measurements changed markedly over the course of the surgical procedure. The Finapres monitor occasionally stopped working and had to be restarted. In 1 patient (not included in this analysis), the Dinamap monitor was unable to determine the blood pressure due to patient shivering; this did not appear to interfere with the Finapres. We conclude that the Finapres monitor does not consistently provide blood pressure information equivalent to that of the Dinamap in obstetric patients undergoing spinal anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Assessing the adequacy of anesthesia in the patient who is without neuromuscular blockade is usually based on somatic as well as sympathetic and hemodynamic responses to stimulation. Because somatic responses are lost in the patient with neuromuscular blockade, a method is needed to replace these signs as an indicator of inadequate anesthesia. This study attempted to determine the relationship between lower esophageal contractility and somatic signs in detecting inadequate fentanyl anesthesia in 20 patients who were undergoing coronary artery surgery and who were hemodynamically stable in the preoperative period. Premedication included midazolam, 0.05 mg/kg intramuscularly, and ranitidine, 2 mg/kg orally. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, 50 micrograms/kg, and maintained by an infusion of fentanyl, 0.2 microgram.kg-1.min-1. After endotracheal intubation, a disposable 24-F esophageal monitoring probe equipped with provoking and measuring balloons was inserted, and both the amplitude of provoked and the rate of spontaneous lower esophageal contractions were displayed and recorded. Inadequate anesthesia was indicated by defined somatic signs in response to noxious stimulation. The presence of these responses was correlated with the amplitude of the provoked and the rate of the spontaneous contractions at five specific times during the period preceding initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. A total of 208 episodes of stimulation were recorded: at insertion of the nasal temperature probe (n = 8), at skin penetration by towel clips (n = 25), at skin incision (n = 20), at sternotomy (n = 20), and during multiple episodes of electrocauterization (n = 135). These provoked 23 somatic responses. The fentanyl concentration in plasma of the 20 patients during the study period was 30 +/- 10 ng/ml (mean +/- SD).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patient movements unrelated to breathing introduce severe errors in ventilator inductive plethysmographic measurements and restrict its usefulness. The purpose of this research was to develop and test a microprocessor-based real-time digital signal processor that uses an adaptive filter to detect patient movements unrelated to breathing. The adaptive filter processor was tested for retrospective identification of artifacts in 20 male volunteers who performed the following specific movements between epochs of quiet, supine breathing: raising arms and legs (slowly, quickly, once, and several times), sitting up, breathing deeply and rapidly, and rolling from a supine to a lateral decubitus position. Flow was simultaneously measured directly with a pneumotachography attached to a mouthpiece. A multilinear regression was used to continuously calculate the calibration constants that relate the pneumotachographic and ventilatory inductive plethysmographic signals. Ventilatory inductive plethysmographic data were then processed, and results scored. There were a total of 166 movements. The calibration coefficients changed dramatically in 146 (88%) of the 166 movements. These movements would have significant errors on ventilatory inductive plethysmographic flow calculation. The changes lasted for the duration of the movements and returned to baseline within two to three breaths. The changes in the coefficients were five or more times larger than the variability around baseline during quiet, supine breathing. All of the total body movements and changes in breathing patterns were detected accurately. The filter detected 46 of 53 upper body movements, 34 of 36 lower body movements, 38 of 38 total body movements, and 19 of 19 breathing pattern changes where the calibration changed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One program performed sorting without errors, provided the field order of the template used to enter references was unchanged. Both programs used \"punctuation files,\" that is, templates for controlling author presentation; punctuation to suit style requirements of individual journals; and order of particular fields, such as publisher and year of publication. Each program was able to format journal, book, and chapter references correctly, but the resulting output required some refining in a word processor. Both require a major time commitment to learn and to create custom punctuation files for journals not included in the predesigned punctuation files. Once mastered, both programs are quite competent at organizing reprints and formatting journal references.\r"

For an alarm system to be successful when an adverse condition occurs, an alarm must be generated and identified, the problem identified and corrected, and the patient stabilized before injury results. The authors describe the characteristics of a structured alarm system that maximizes the time available to correct a potential problem before injury begins, that clearly identifies the cause of the problem, and that prioritizes alarms according to the urgency of the required response. Alarms should be easy to temporarily silence, have built-in alarm default settings to prevent the inadvertant use of settings meant for a previous patient, and have a graphic display that enables the operator to detect problems or trends before an alarm sounds.\r"

  ".W": "Prognostic factors have been examined in 644 patients with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage T1 breast carcinoma treated by mastectomy and followed for a median of 18.2 years. Overall, 148 patients (23%) died of recurrent breast carcinoma. Eighteen (3%) were alive with recurrent disease and 478 (74%) were alive or died of other causes without recurrence. Unfavorable clinicopathologic features were larger tumor size (1.1 to 2.0 cm v less than or equal to 1 cm), perimenopausal menstrual status, the number of axillary lymph node metastases, poorly differentiated grade, presence of lymphatic tumor emboli (LI) in breast tissue near the primary tumor, blood vessel invasion (BVI), and an intense lymphoplasmacytic reaction around the tumor. Median survival after recurrence for the entire series was 2 years. This was not significantly influenced by tumor size, the number of axillary nodal metastases, the type of treatment for recurrence, or the interval to recurrence. The proportions surviving 5 and 10 years after recurrence were 17% and 5%, respectively. Among T1N0M0 cases, the chance of a local recurrence was 2.8% within 20 years. Median survival of T1N0M0 cases after local recurrence (4.5 years) was significantly longer than after systemic recurrence (1.5 years). A similar trend (3.7 v 2.0 years), not statistically significant, was seen in T1N1M0 patients, who had a 6.5% chance of local recurrence within 20 years. Median survival following systemic recurrence detected 10 or more years after diagnosis in T1N0M0 and in T1N1M0 patients was significantly longer than the median survival for systemic recurrences found in the first decade of follow-up. This difference did not apply following local recurrence in either T1N0M0 or T1N1M0 cases. It is evident that patients with T1 breast carcinoma can be subdivided into differing prognostic groups and this must be taken into account when considering the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage I disease. Systemic adjuvant treatment may prove to be beneficial for patients with unfavorable prognostic factors, while women with an especially low risk for recurrence (eg, T1N0M0 tumor 1.0 cm or less) might be spared such treatment.\r"

  ".U": "89361559\r", 
  ".W": "In an effort to increase the proportion of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remaining in continued complete remission (CCR), we administered intensive postremission consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) and daunorubicin. Eighty-seven patients, with a median age of 38 years (range, 7 to 71), received consolidation therapy after first complete remission was obtained with standard induction chemotherapy that included conventional doses of Ara-C. Consolidation therapy consisted of from one to three cycles of high-dose Ara-C (3 g/m2 intravenously [IV] over 1 hour every 12 hours for 12 doses) followed by daunorubicin (30 mg/m2/d IV bolus for 3 days). After completion of the high-dose Ara-C and daunorubicin, no further therapy was administered. Myelosuppression encountered with consolidation resulted in a median duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia of 3 weeks. Four patients (5%) died during consolidation due to infection and/or hemorrhage; 59% of patients experienced severe but nonfatal infectious or extramedullary organ toxicity. With a median follow-up of more than 3.5 years from diagnosis, the proportion of patients, by Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate, remaining in CCR is 49% (95% confidence limits, 37% to 61%). In a Cox multivariate analysis, only age significantly (P less than .001) influenced the probability of remaining in CCR. The probability of remaining in CCR was 83%, 50%, and 23% for age groups of 25 or less, 26 to 45, and more than 45 years, respectively. These survival curves all have stable long-term plateaus, suggesting cure. In this study, the administration of brief, intensive nonmarrow ablative chemotherapy resulted in a large proportion of patients with AML remaining in CCR, results similar to those reported with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Relapse of acute leukemia was still the major reason for therapy failure, suggesting that more effective or additional postremission therapy will be required to further improve the likelihood of cure especially for older patients.\r"

  ".W": "Primary lymphoma of bone (PLB) occurs infrequently in children. Between January 1962 and November 1988, 395 children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Eleven of these patients (2.8%) presented with a bone primary, usually in the femur (eight of 11 patients). The median age of these seven boys and four girls at presentation was 13 years (range, 5.5 to 19 years). Seven patients had one or more additional bones involved. All patients had high-grade lymphomas based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Working Formulation. The histologic subtypes included six large-cell lymphomas, three lymphoblastic lymphomas, one small-noncleaved, non-Burkitt's lymphoma, and one unclassifiable lymphoma. Treatment consisted of multiagent chemotherapy combined with local radiation therapy in seven of 11 patients. Six of 10 children who received chemotherapy as a component of their initial therapy, including all who presented with localized tumor, are alive with no evidence of disease 2+ to 85+ months (median, 42.5 months) after cessation of treatment; one patient has just completed chemotherapy. Each of the four patients who died showed leukemic conversion 5 to 11 months after diagnosis, and three died of progressive disease. One patient died of sepsis during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia with no evidence of disease at necropsy. We conclude that optimal therapy for PLB, as with all other forms of NHL, should focus on the histologic subtype and stage of disease.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-four patients with locally advanced, nonresectable gastric cancer (staged by laparotomy) received etoposide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and cisplatin (EAP). Thirty-three patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Second-look surgery with removal of residual tumor by gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy was performed in case of complete/partial remission (CR/PR) after EAP. After successful resection (R0- and R1-resection), two cycles of EAP were administered for consolidation therapy. Patients refusing reoperation received up to six cycles of EAP. The response rate (CR/PR) after EAP was 70% (23/33), including a 21% (7/33) rate of clinical CRs (CCRs). Two patients had minor remission (MR)/no change and seven had progressive disease. There was one early death. Nineteen of 23 responders (5 CCRs, 14 clinical PRs [CPRs]) and one patient with MR underwent second-look surgery. Five CCRs were pathologically confirmed; 10 patients with CPR were without evidence of disease (NED) after resection. In three patients (CPR), R1-resections (microscopically tumor-cell positive proximal margin) were performed; two patients are disease-free, 22+ and 33+ months after consolidation chemotherapy. In two patients, the tumor was again considered nonresectable. Twenty patients were disease-free after EAP +/- surgery +/- consolidation chemotherapy. Toxicity was primarily hematologic. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia of World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 occurred in 30% and 9%, respectively and grade 4 in 18% and 9% of the patients, respectively. There was no increased peri- or postoperative morbidity. After a median follow-up of 20 months for disease-free patients, the relapse rate is 60% (12/20). The median survival time for all patients is 18 months and for disease-free patients 24 months. EAP is highly effective in locally advanced gastric cancer, and offers a chance for surgery with curative intention in patients with an otherwise fatal prognosis.\r"

We examined the chemosensitizing activity of a new triphenylethylene, toremifene, and its major metabolites in a doxorubicin-resistant human breast cell line, MCF-7/DOX. In addition, we examined the chemosensitizing activity of unbound plasma toremifene and its metabolites isolated from patients treated with toremifene doses of 20 to 400 mg/d. MCF-7/DOX cells were exposed to ultrafiltrate plasma specimens in the absence and presence of doxorubicin. These latter studies were single-blinded. Toremifene and its major metabolites were capable of sensitizing multidrug-resistant cells to doxorubicin. The degree of chemosensitizing activity in vitro correlated with the plasma concentrations of toremifene and its metabolites (P less than .05). Plasma samples isolated from patients receiving high-dose toremifene (400 mg/d) had the greatest chemosensitizing activity. We present evidence that toremifene and its metabolites can sensitize resistant MCF-7/DOX cells to doxorubicin, that this effect is concentration-dependent, and that sensitizing activity can be detected at clinically achieved concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "New medical knowledge is emerging at a tremendous rate. Diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Parkinson's disease, cancer, and others (diseases once considered beyond the scope of medicine) are receiving a great deal of attention. Yet it is a paradox that, at a time when we are learning more about the biology of the human being, it is more difficult to creatively develop the new knowledge into diagnostic tests, surgical interventions, and preventive strategies. The pace of biomedical innovation is being slowed by an increase in the intervention of nonmedical \"managers of care.\" The driving force behind managed care is concern over cost. The managers of medical care have sought to control costs by controlling the doctor's decision making. This is the focus of managed care. The physicians of today, therefore, face a remarkable challenge. They must respond to the needs of patients while being held accountable to an increasing number of overseers in the public and private sectors. These managers of care justify their activities on the notion that the patient will be better off and the cost less if the doctor-patient encounter is regulated by protocols, statistical comparison, utilization review, and fee schedules. While doctor's decisions are being managed by others, who is managing the managers? The answer should be the medical community, principally doctors. Unfortunately, the answer at the moment is the payors--governmental reimbursement agencies, intermediaries, employers, hospitals, or new corporations designed to manage medical costs. The challenge to the physician is to retain the responsibility for those things for which he or she is held accountable. The challenge should not be ignored.\r"

  ".W": "The localization of cortical sites essential for language was assessed by stimulation mapping in the left, dominant hemispheres of 117 patients. Sites were related to language when stimulation at a current below the threshold for afterdischarge evoked repeated statistically significant errors in object naming. The language center was highly localized in many patients to form several mosaics of 1 to 2 sq cm, usually one in the frontal and one or more in the temporoparietal lobe. The area of individual mosaics, and the total area related to language was usually much smaller than the traditional Broca-Wernicke areas. There was substantial individual variability in the exact location of language function, some of which correlated with the patient's sex and verbal intelligence. These features were present for patients as young as 4 years and as old as 80 years, and for those with lesions acquired in early life or adulthood. These findings indicate a need for revision of the classical model of language localization. The combination of discrete localization in individual patients but substantial individual variability between patients also has major clinical implications for cortical resections of the dominant hemisphere, for it means that language cannot be reliably localized on anatomic criteria alone. A maximal resection with minimal risk of postoperative aphasia requires individual localization of language with a technique like stimulation mapping.\r"

Patients who were rendered totally seizure-free by ATL showed significant improvements on multiple indices of psychological distress and psychological well-being, improvement that continued up to 3 months after surgery and remained constant at 6 months postoperatively. Patients who were significantly improved (greater than 75% reduction in seizure frequency) but continued to experience some seizure activity showed no significant improvements in behavioral or emotional adjustment. The clinical and theoretical significance of these findings is discussed, and it is suggested that functional outcome (for instance, mental health) following ATL may be best predicted by a binary seizure outcome classification (seizure-free or not seizure-free).\r"

The tumor specimens were stained for BUdR using the immunoperoxidase method; the BUdR labeling index (LI), or S-phase fraction, was calculated as the percentage of BUdR-positive cells. The median BUdR LI's for 127 primary moderately anaplastic astrocytomas, highly anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas (less than 1%, 2.7%, and 7.3%, respectively; range 0% to 38.1%) were not significantly different from those of 55 similar recurrent tumors (less than 1%, 4.3%, and 7.4%, respectively; range 0% to 30.5%). The mean LI was significantly higher in tumors from patients over 50 years of age than in tumors from younger patients (p less than 0.001). The age-related difference in LI's was found in both groups of patients with astrocytomas but not in those with glioblastomas. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a significantly greater probability of survival among patients whose tumors had LI's of less than 1% than among those with LI's greater than 5%; survival probability of patients with tumor LI's of 1% to 5% was intermediate between the two extremes. Thus, the BUdR LI appears to reflect the proliferative potential more accurately than the histopathological diagnosis and should therefore be considered an important factor in determining the prognosis of individual patients with intracranial gliomas and in selecting their treatment.\r"

The prediction of recurrence by clinical and histopathological means is inadequate. Flow cytometric analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in meningiomas has shown a correlation between a high proliferative index based on tumor cell-cycle stage (%S + %G2/M) and clinically aggressive behavior. Accordingly, the DNA analysis of meningioma tissue may be of value in predicting recurrence of these tumors. To test this hypothesis, the DNA of paraffin-embedded archival tissue from known recurrent meningiomas was compared with an age- and sex-matched nonrecurrent group. Both groups had comparable follow-up periods. Forty patients with total macroscopic removal at the time of surgery were analyzed. The paraffin blocks of these tumors were retrieved and reclassified histologically according to the World Health Organization system. Sections were then taken for flow cytometric study. The DNA analysis showed that the proliferative index of the recurrent group was significantly higher than that of the nonrecurrent group (p less than 0.002), although the histological subtyping of the two groups was similar. These results support the suggestion that flow cytometry may be of value in the prediction of recurrence of histologically benign, macroscopically removed meningiomas.\r"

Eleven fistulas were located in the transverse sinus, two in the cavernous sinus, two in the straight sinus, and one in the falx-tentorial region near the vein of Galen. The patients were treated with a combination of endovascular and neurosurgical techniques. Fourteen patients underwent preoperative transarterial embolization; this procedure closed the fistula in one patient. In the remaining 15 patients, surgery was performed to provide access to the fistula for embolization from either the venous or the arterial side, or for excision of the fistula. Transvenous embolization completely obliterated the fistula in seven of nine patients; the fistulas were embolized incompletely through the feeding arteries in two patients; and complete surgical resection of the lesion was accomplished in four patients. Complications related to venous occlusion occurred in two patients and one patient suffered communicating hydrocephalus that was effectively treated by shunting. There were no deaths. The results suggest that combined endovascular and neurosurgical techniques are a safe and effective means for the treatment of selected complex dural AV fistulas.\r"

Patients with distortion of the fifth nerve root caused by extrinsic vascular compression underwent microvascular decompression, those with no compression underwent partial sensory rhizotomy, and those with vascular contact but no distortion of the nerve root underwent decompression and rhizotomy. The mean follow-up period was 5.1 years. An excellent (75%) or good (8%) clinical outcome was achieved in 208 patients; 13 patients (5%) experienced little or no pain relief. Thirty-one patients (12%) suffered recurrent trigeminal neuralgia an average of 1.9 pain-free years after operation; recurrence continued at a rate of approximately 2% per year thereafter. Reoperation for recurrent or persistent pain provided excellent or good results in 85% of reoperated patients, but partial sensory rhizotomy was required in most of these patients. Outcome was affected by previous surgical procedures. A previous percutaneous radiofrequency lesion was associated with a significantly greater incidence of fifth nerve complications and a worse outcome after posterior fossa exploration. Because of this finding, the authors recommend that percutaneous radiofrequency rhizolysis be reserved for patients who have failed posterior fossa exploration or who are not candidates for surgery. Patients with compressive nerve root distortion and a short duration of symptoms before surgery had a significantly better outcome than patients with a longer duration of symptoms. In contrast, there was no relationship between the duration of symptoms and outcome of patients without nerve root distortion. Vascular decompression may cause dysfunction of the trigeminal system in tic douloureux, but in patients who remain untreated for long periods an intrinsic abnormality develops that may perpetuate pain even after microvascular decompression. Posterior fossa exploration is recommended as the procedure of choice for patients with trigeminal neuralgia who are surgical candidates.\r"

Review of available radiographic, operative, and pathological information suggests that most, if not all, occipital encephaloceles are associated with an anomaly of the hindbrain, and the usual anomaly is a rhombic roof encephalocele. In such cases, the site of cranial herniation is caudal to the torcula, regardless of the presence or absence of occipital lobe tissue within the sac. Experimental and clinical analysis suggests that occipital encephaloceles most likely arise from abnormalities in the development of the skull base.\r"

  ".W": "Liposomes have a variety of attributes as a drug delivery system. Targeting of liposomes to specific cells has been investigated by using appropriate cytophilic ligands such as monoclonal antibodies (MAb's). In the present study, liposomes with selective cytotoxicity toward glioma cells were obtained. An MAb which reacts with a glioma-associated antigen, G-22-MAb, was coupled with liposomes by the cross-linking reagent dipalmitoyl L-alpha-phosphatidylethanolamine 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate. Interaction of the liposomes with glioma cells was morphologically observed by fluorescence microscopy, and uptake of liposomal contents into glioma cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using carboxyfluorescein as a marker. It was demonstrated that G-22-MAb could be coupled with liposomes without altering its specificity toward glioma cells and that coupling with the MAb led to a significant increase in the uptake of liposomal contents into glioma cells. Liposomes containing an antitumor drug, methotrexate (MTX), were prepared and their cytotoxicity was examined by a colorimetric growth assay. Upon incorporation of MTX into the MAb-coupled liposomes, the cytotoxicity toward glioma cells was increased 100-fold as compared with free MTX. These results indicate that G-22-MAb-coupled liposomes containing MTX have selective cytotoxicity toward glioma cells and could be utilized for targeting the chemotherapy of gliomas.\r"

  ".W": "Seven human glioblastoma cell lines established in vitro from primary tumor explants were studied. A marked heterogeneity of glial fibrillary acidic protein was observed whereas vimentin was uniformly expressed by all cell lines. Indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytofluorometry revealed a heterogeneous distribution of surface GE 2 and CG 12 tumor-associated antigens (TAA's): three cell lines were positive (greater than 69% TAA-positive cells) and three cell lines were negative (less than 9% TAA-positive cells). One cell line (Hu 228) was moderately positive at early culture passages and subsequently acquired a TAA-negative phenotype. The difference in the relative amounts of surface TAA's of the three positive cell lines was less than twofold. In spite of the heterogeneous distribution of surface TAA's, all cell lines exhibited considerable amounts of intracellular TAA. Treatment with phorbol esters and density-dependent growth arrest decreased the percentage of the TAA-positive cells and the amount of cell-surface TAA's in one cell line (Hu 195). Interferon-gamma treatment in vitro increased the percentage of CG 12-positive cells by 12% and the amount of cell-surface CG 12 antigens by 38% as compared to untreated cells. The percentage of TAA-positive cells among phorbol ester-treated cells of the Hu 195 cell line was lowest 48 hours after treatment, but returned to normal values within the next 48 hours. Reduction of 3H-thymidine incorporation preceded the decrease in number of TAA-positive cells by about 18 hours. Two-color fluorescence analysis performed in positive cell lines for simultaneous determination of surface TAA's and deoxyribonucleic acid content or reactivity with the proliferation-associated Ki67 intracellular marker indicated that GE 2 and CG 12 antigens are expressed preferentially by actively proliferating glioma cells. The results of this study indicate the existence of two different phenotypes in cultured human glioblastoma cells: surface TAA-positive/cytosol TAA-positive and surface TAA-negative/cytosol TAA-positive cell populations. In addition, modulation of TAA expression was dependent on the cell-cycle differentiation stage, culture conditions, and proliferative state of the cells.\r"

In the present study spinal cord blood flow (SCBF), measured by the hydrogen clearance technique, and motor and somatosensory evoked potentials (MEP and SSEP) were recorded to evaluate whether the administration of nimodipine and dextran 40, alone or in combination, could increase posttraumatic SCBF and improve axonal function in the cord after acute SCI. Thirty rats received a 53-gm clip compression injury on the cord at T-1 and were then randomly and blindly allocated to one of six treatment groups (five rats in each). Each group was given an intravenous infusion of one of the following over 1 hour, commencing 1 hour after SCI: placebo and saline; placebo and dextran 40; nimodipine 0.02 mg/kg and saline; nimodipine 0.02 mg/kg and dextran 40; nimodipine 0.05 mg/kg and saline; and nimodipine 0.05 mg/kg and dextran 40. The preinjury physiological parameters, including the SCBF at T-1 (mean +/- standard error of the mean: 56.84 +/- 4.51 ml/100 gm/min), were not significantly different (p greater than 0.05) among the treatment groups. Following SCI, there was a significant decrease in the SCBF at T-1 (24.55 +/- 2.99 ml/100 gm/min; p less than 0.0001) as well as significant changes in the MEP recorded from the spinal cord (MEP-C) (p less than 0.0001), the MEP recorded from the sciatic nerve (MEP-N) (p less than 0.0001), and the SSEP (p less than 0.002). Only the combination of nimodipine 0.02 mg/kg and dextran 40 increased the SCBF at T-1 (43.69 +/- 6.09 ml/100 gm/min; p less than 0.003) and improved the MEP-C (p less than 0.0001), MEP-N (p less than 0.04), and SSEP (p less than 0.002) following SCI. With this combination, the changes in SCBF were significantly related to improvement in axonal function in the motor tracts (p less than 0.0001) and somatosensory tracts (p less than 0.0001) of the cord. This study provides quantitative evidence that an increase in posttraumatic SCBF can significantly improve the function of injured spinal cord axons, and strongly implicates posttraumatic ischemia in the pathogenesis of acute SCI.\r"

Cerebral ischemia was produced by a four-vessel occlusion method. In the control rat, the enzyme activity was 0.87 +/- 0.13 nmol/gm wet weight/min at 25 degrees C (mean +/- standard deviation), of which 92.4% was associated with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent dehydrogenase form and only 7.6% with the oxygen-dependent superoxide-producing oxidase form. However, the ratio of the latter form increased to 43.7% after 30 minutes of global ischemia, despite the total xanthine oxidase activity remaining the same. Thus, it was revealed that uric acid can be synthesized in the rat brain and that cerebral ischemia induced the conversion of xanthine oxidase from an NAD-dependent dehydrogenase to an oxygen-dependent superoxide-producing oxidase. Although the xanthine oxidase pathway has been proposed as a source of oxygen-derived free radicals in various ischemic organs other than brain, the results of the present study suggest the involvement of the oxygen free radicals generated from this pathway in the pathogenesis of the ischemic injury of the rat brain.\r"

  ".W": "To verify whether lipid peroxidation is associated with focal cerebral ischemia, a unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion was carried out in rats. The concentrations of various endogenous antioxidants in the ischemic center were measured, including alpha-tocopherol and ubiquinones as lipid-soluble antioxidants and ascorbate as a water-soluble antioxidant. At 30 minutes after ischemia, alpha-tocopherol decreased to 79% of baseline, reduced ubiquinone-9 to 73%, ubiquinone-10 to 66%, and reduced ascorbate to 76%. Six hours after ischemia, alpha-tocopherol decreased to 63% and reached a plateau, whereas reduced ubiquinones and reduced ascorbate declined further to 16% and 10%, respectively, 12 hours after ischemia and then reached plateau levels. These results suggest functional and durational differences between antioxidants and lipid peroxidation in this ischemic model. Although the reciprocal increase in oxidized ubiquinones during ischemia was not observed, that of oxidized ascorbate was noted. The complementary antioxidant system between cytoplasmic and membranous components, the combination alpha-tocopherol/ascorbate, was estimated from the calculated consumption ratio of these antioxidants on the basis that the loss of these reduced antioxidants is due to neutralization of free radicals. This system is suggested to play an important role in the early ischemic period. Urate also increased during ischemia. The possible involvement of the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system in initiating free radical reactions in cerebral ischemia is also discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine the hypotheses that structural stiffening of the arterial wall contributes to chronic cerebral vasospasm, and that alteration in properties of smooth muscle takes place after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Subarachnoid hemorrhage and subsequent chronic vasospasm were induced in dogs by two cisternal injections of autologous blood (on Day 0 and Day 2). Vasospasm was confirmed by angiography performed on Day 0 and Day 7. Animals in the control group underwent angiography only. On Day 8, the mechanical properties of the basilar arteries were studied in vitro. Passive compliance, measured under total inhibition of spontaneous myogenic tone with diltiazem (10(-4) M) plus papaverine (10(-4) M) was smaller in the SAH group. The length-contraction curve was shifted to the left and the optimum length for maximum contraction (Lmax) was significantly shorter in the spastic blood vessels. The spontaneous myogenic tone was augmented in the SAH group, resulting in an increase in resting tension at each length. By contrast, the maximum contractions in response to KCl and uridine 5'-triphosphate were markedly reduced in the SAH group, without changes in sensitivity to these agents. These differences in mechanical properties were observed in rings both with and without endothelium. The results indicate that, in chronic vasospasm, stiffening of the noncontractile component of the vasculature takes place as well as alterations in the contractile component, both of which presumably contribute to the shift in resting length-tension relationship and length-contraction relationship of the artery. The decreased distensibility, the increase in resting tension, and the shortening of the Lmax all favor a smaller diameter of the artery after SAH, possibly contributing to vasospasm.\r"

  ".U": "89361697\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that following experimental brain injury cerebral arterioles dilate and display endothelial lesions and reduced responsiveness to hypocapnia. These abnormalities are caused by cyclo-oxygenase-dependent free radical generation. There is evidence that the kallikrein-kinin system may in part stimulate the cyclooxygenase-dependent damage since bradykinin is a powerful stimulator of prostaglandin formation and it has recently been shown that a specific kinin receptor blocker decreases the arteriolar abnormalities caused by injury. In order to further examine the hypothesis that the kallikrein-kinin system is important in inducing damage, rat brain tissue was examined for kininogen, the precursor of kinins, at 10 minutes and 1, 3, 6, 15, 24, 48, and 72 hours after injury. A fluid-percussion brain injury device was attached over the right cerebral cortex of rats and a 1.6-atmosphere pressure injury was administered. The kininogen content was determined by a radioimmunoassay procedure in tissues which were free of intravascular blood. After injury, bleeding was confined mainly to the right hemisphere. The kininogen content in the right hemisphere was significantly elevated by one hour after injury, continued to rise until 15 hours after injury, then was significantly decreased by 2 days after injury. In the left hemisphere, kininogen was significantly elevated at 1 hour postinjury, returned toward control levels over the 3- to 6-hour period after injury, then was again elevated at 15 hours after injury. These studies also show that brain water and cerebrovascular permeability were greater at 15 hours postinjury than at earlier time points. The data further support a role for the kallikrein-kinin system in brain injury and, when considered with the results of other studies, suggest that a secondary event is occurring in the 12- to 24-hour period after neural injury. The authors hypothesize that this secondary event is related to endothelial and vascular repair and may be important for the return of normal cerebrovascular function.\r"

Iodine-131 MIBG is a relatively stable radiopharmaceutical that is primarily excreted in the urine. Therefore, impaired renal function would be expected to alter [131I]MIBG pharmacokinetics which would thus affect blood levels, as well as scintigraphy. An 18-yr-old anephric male presented with hypertension and suspected pheochromocytoma. We have compared the [131I]MIBG scintigraphy and blood clearance kinetics in this anephric patient, two patients with renal insufficiency and four patients with normal renal function. The degree of renal insufficiency was directly correlated to the CPM/image (an index of whole-body retention) on all 3 days of imaging and the slower clearance of radioactivity from the blood. The relative distribution of radioactivity between the plasma and cell fractions was greatest in the patients with renal insufficiency. We therefore suggest that attention be paid to plasma creatinine levels prior to the administration of [131I] MIBG to permit accurate interpretation of scintigraphy. In addition, the effect of renal insufficiency on radiation dosimetry should be considered. It may thus be prudent to reduce the administered dose of [131I]MIBG given to anephric or renally insufficient patients to decrease radiation dose.\r"

Peak myocardial extraction (Emax), permeability-surface area products (PScap), and net myocardial extraction (Enet) were compared among serial injections during constant coronary flows. Overall, measures of transcapillary transport (Emax and PScap) for SESTAMIBI were significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than those simultaneously determined for thallium, but estimates of tissue retention (Enet) for SESTAMIBI and thallium were not statistically distinguishable. Hypoxia had no significant effect on mean (+/- s.d.) Emax for SESTAMIBI (0.31 +/- 0.13) or thallium (0.59 +/- 0.11), nor on mean PScap or Enet values. Ouabain (1.5 X 10(-7) M and 1.5 X 10(-6) M) had no effect on SESTAMIBI or thallium Emax (respectively, 0.29 +/- 0.08 and 0.60 +/- 0.05) or on PScap for SESTAMIBI. Thallium PScap was depressed with higher ouabain dose (control, 1.22 +/- 0.40; high ouabain, 1.06 +/- 0.41 ml/min/g; p less than 0.01). Ouabain also caused a significant and progressive increase in average SESTAMIBI Enet (control, 0.23 +/- 0.10 to high ouabain, 0.33 +/- 0.12; p less than 0.05), but depressed thallium Enet (control, 0.38 +/- 0.14 to high ouabain, 0.32 +/- 0.18; p less than 0.01). These results suggest myocardial metabolic and/or functional status have minor influence on transcapillary transport of SESTAMIBI and thallium, but significantly affects cellular retention.\r"

  ".W": "Serial scintigraphic images following injection of [99mTc]iminodiacetic acid compounds such as [99mTc]diisopropyl-iminodiacetic acid (DISIDA) provide qualitative information about liver function. We have investigated approaches for quantitatively describing liver function in terms of the kinetics of DISIDA extraction and excretion by the liver. Several compartmental model configurations were evaluated. A three-compartment model (blood, hepatic parenchyma, intrahepatic bile) was found to fit the data best and was used in conjunction with dynamic image data to obtain estimates of rate constants for liver extraction and excretion of DISIDA, and mean residence time (MRT) of DISIDA in the liver. A noncompartmental approach based on a parametric deconvolution technique was also used to estimate the noncompartmental mean residence time (MRTnc). To assess limitations of the noncompartmental approach, computer simulations were performed using the three-compartment model to generate time-activity curves followed by analysis of these curves by the noncompartmental method. The effect of plasma total bilirubin level on DISIDA uptake and MRT was also investigated. These techniques are readily adaptable to standard nuclear medicine computing facilities, and could be used in the clinical setting to numerically describe serial DISIDA studies (especially in liver transplant patients) efficiently and noninvasively.\r"

  ".W": "Kinetic sensitivity is the ability of a physiochemical parameter to alter the time-activity curve of a radiotracer. The kinetic sensitivity of liver and blood time-activity data resulting from a single bolus injection of [99mTc]galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin [( Tc]NGA) into healthy pigs was examined. Three parameters, hepatic plasma flow scaled as flow per plasma volume, ligand-receptor affinity, and total receptor concentration, were tested using [Tc]NGA injections of various molar doses and affinities. Simultaneous measurements of plasma volume (iodine-125 human serum albumin dilution), and hepatic plasma flow (indocyanine green extraction) were performed during 12 [Tc]NGA studies. Paired data sets demonstrated differences (P(chi v2) less than 0.01) in liver and blood time-activity curves in response to changes in each of the tested parameters. We conclude that the [Tc]NGA radiopharmacokinetic system is therefore sensitive to hepatic plasma flow, ligand-receptor affinity, and receptor concentration. In vivo demonstration of kinetic sensitivity permits delineation of the physiologic parameters that determine the biodistribution of a radiopharmaceutical. This delineation is a prerequisite to a valid analytic assessment of receptor biochemistry via kinetic modeling.\r"

We investigated the organ specificity of this process. Equal amounts of homologous PMN, derived from the intravascular space and labeled with [111In]oxine, were infused either intravenously (i.v.) or intraarterially (i.a.) into pairs of rats. Changes in radioactivity emitted from three regions--representing lung, liver and spleen, and lower body--were determined from images during the following hour. A nonspecific character was demonstrated by the transient sequestration of activity in the lower body following i.a. infusions. However, the rate of initial clearance of activity (first 30 min) from the lungs of i.v.-infused rats was relatively slower than from the lower body of i.a.-infused rats. This suggests the presence of a lung-specific as well, which may be important for localization of PMN-related events to the lung.\r"

Two half-lives were calculated for the biexponential splenic time-activity curve after i.v. injection of 111In-labeled platelets. There was no difference in the mean half-life of the rapid component of the splenic curve (ST1) when patients with negative or slightly positive platelet suspension immunofluorescence test (PSIFT) were compared to those with strongly positive PSIFT (3.0 +/- 0.7 min vs. 3.6 +/- 0.4, p greater than 0.05). Mean half-life of the slow component of the splenic curve (ST2) was found to be longer in patients with a strongly positive than a negative or weakly positive PSIFT (26 +/- 5 min vs. 13.2 +/- 1.0 min, p less than 0.01). It seems that determination of the two components of the splenic time-activity curve provides a useful method for studying platelet kinetics in ITP.\r"

A significant feature of the system was circuitry for performing pulse tail extrapolation and separation of individual pulses involved in pulse pile-up events. System deadtime, flood field uniformity, energy resolution, linearity, spatial resolution, and bar phantom image quality were evaluated for count rates up to 200 kcps in a 20% photopeak window. Our results indicate that this camera design does not compromise image quality at normal clinical count rates and at higher event rates can provide better image quality and increased sensitivity over many Anger cameras currently employed in nuclear medicine.\r"

Family background and home rearing conditions were assessed, and these variables were separated from the correlations between nutrition and outcome by partial correlation methods. Food intake was related to anthropometric status, play behaviors, and total amount of verbalization and play even when the potentially confounding effects of certain family background and home rearing variables were covaried. Food intake was not related to Bayley Mental and Motor scores, but measures of length and weight were, even when family background and home rearing variables were held constant. Mild to moderate malnutrition does appear to affect the child's development adversely even when other environmental characteristics, which also relate to development, are considered.\r"

Patients received 0.125 mg/kg of growth hormone three times per week for 1 year.

At the end of therapy, the mean growth velocity had increased to 8.9 +/- 1.2 cm/yr (range 7.5 to 10.7 cm/yr), and the mean height standard deviation score improved to -2.36 +/- 0.83 (range -1.15 to -3.18). Bone age advancement was consistent with the period of growth. Routine laboratory determinations, including results of glucose tolerance testing, did not vary significantly from pretreatment levels.

Plasma and erythrocyte malonyldialdehyde (MDA) values were significantly higher compared with normal control values, whereas plasma and erythrocyte tocopherol measurements were lower. Oral administration of high doses of vitamin E (300 mg/day for 15 days) resulted in lower serum MDA levels, whereas serum vitamin levels did not change significantly. In erythrocytes, the MDA decreased but not to control levels, and vitamin E increased but to lower values than normal. Hematologic values also improved.

  ".W": "To understand the natural history of chronic hepatitis B virus infection in children, we studied factors affecting the clearance of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). One hundred sixty-nine apparently healthy children whose sera were positive for HBeAg and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and who were recruited by screening were followed prospectively to delineate the HBeAg clearance rate. Another 59 carrier children visiting the outpatient clinic because of symptoms or abnormal liver function were studied for comparison. The annual HBeAg clearance rate was low (less than 2%) during the first 3 years of life but increased with age. The HBeAg clearance rate in children older than 6 years of age was lower in those whose mothers had HBsAg positivity (14.3%) than in those whose mothers had no detectable HBsAg (35.3%). Children who were brought for medical care had higher HBeAg clearance rates (42.4%) than those who were recruited by screening (14.6%) because immune clearance of hepatitis B virus and hence HBeAg often led to hepatocellular damage manifested by abnormal liver function profiles or by symptoms that had caused the parents to seek medical care for their children. We conclude that age, source of subject recruitment, and maternal HBsAg status are important factors affecting HBeAg clearance rate in HBsAg carriers.\r"

Extensive multichannel polygraph recordings were obtained and pulmonary function tests were performed on 50 convalescent infants from the neonatal intensive care unit before, during, and after placement in a Cosco-Peterson First Ride car seat. Mean total dynamic compliance, total pulmonary resistance, and work of breathing improved in the car seat. Thirty percent of premature infants experienced hypoxia, bradycardia, or both in a car seat; in this group, tidal volume was lower (p = 0.02). In 11 of 16 infants with abnormal findings, oxygen desaturation was temporally related to episodes of short and mixed apnea. No term convalescent infant experienced respiratory difficulty in a car seat regardless of primary diagnosis. We conclude that premature infants may have respiratory compromise of a multifactorial nature when in car seats. Further development of car seats is necessary if such respiratory problems are to be avoided.\r"

If this hypothesis were correct, pulmonary resistance should decrease with the administration of oxygen. To test this hypothesis, we studied 10 infants recovering from severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (study weight 2490 +/- 275 gm; birth weight 1010 +/- 89 gm; postnatal age 73 +/- 7 days; postconceptional age 38.5 +/- 1.6 weeks) and 10 matched control infants (study weight 2430 +/- 179 gm; birth weight 2320 +/- 195 gm; postnatal age 25 +/- 4 days; postconceptional age 37.5 +/- 0.8 weeks). Resistance and compliance were measured by means of a mask with a flowmeter and an esophageal balloon (with the PEDS computer program). Measurements in both groups were made in quiet sleep, without sedation, during the inhalation of room air and during the fifth minute of oxygen inhalation. We found that (1) total pulmonary resistance, significantly higher in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia than in control infants, decreased from 206.1 +/- 47 cm H2O.L-1.sec-1 during inhalation of room air to 106.5 +/- 20.9 during inhalation of 100% oxygen (p less than 0.05) and (2) pulmonary dynamic compliance, lower in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia than in control infants, increased significantly with the administration of 100% oxygen. The results suggest that infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia have airway constriction and that this is alleviated by inhalation of oxygen.\r"

Coagulation tests were performed on the day of admission to the study and 4 to 6 days later. Twenty-three patients were enrolled; 12 received immune globulin intravenously plus aspirin, and 11 received aspirin alone. At initiation of the study the groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, race, and time from onset of illness to study entry. Coagulation values were similar at entry with the exception that the aspirin group had a geometric mean platelet count that was higher than the platelet count in the aspirin-immune globulin group (p = 0.02). Four days after entry there were no significant differences between the two groups in any coagulation studies. Although the immune globulin preparation used has been effective in reducing the prevalence of coronary artery aneurysms, it appears to have no early effect on reduction of platelet activation or other measures of coagulopathy. The mechanism of action of immune globulin in patients with Kawasaki syndrome remains to be elucidated.\r"

Control stools contained no drug. Meconium from the infants of drug-dependent mothers showed the presence of at least one drug metabolite: 80% of the infants of drug-dependent mothers showed cocaine (range 0.14 to 19.91 micrograms/gm stool), 55% showed morphine (range 0.41 to 14.97 micrograms/gm stool), and 60% showed cannabinoid (range 0.05 to 0.67 micrograms/gm stool). The concentrations of metabolites were highest during the first 2 days; some stools tested positive up to the third day. In contrast, only 37% of the infants had positive results on a urine screen (fluorescent polarization immunoassay method). Paired urine and meconium specimens, both analyzed by radioimmunoassay, showed a higher concentration of drug metabolites in the latter; eight urine samples had no detectable drugs despite a corresponding positive stool test result. We conclude that meconium is useful for drug screening in the neonate.\r"

A dosage schedule of 15 mg/kg was used on 26 occasions, and a spinal fluid ethionamide concentration of 2.5 micrograms/ml, the in vitro minimal inhibitory concentration for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was exceeded on only seven occasions (27%). A dosage of 20 mg/kg was administered on 13 occasions, and in only two instances (15%) was a concentration of 2.5 micrograms/ml not achieved. Ethionamide in a single daily dosage of 20 mg/kg should be considered for the initial treatment of tuberculous meningitis when the presence of isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis cannot be excluded.\r"

Those with CIN were compared with three non-CIN groups: (1) teenagers who were referred to a teen colposcopy clinic but had no evidence of CIN (high-risk group), (2) teenagers seen at a gynecology clinic without STD symptoms (asymptomatic group), and (3) teenagers seen at the gynecology clinic with STD symptoms (symptomatic group). The percentage of cervical ectopy was measured by colpophotography. Subjects with CIN had more lifetime sexual partners than the asymptomatic group (p less than 0.001) and were more likely to smoke cigarettes than either gynecology clinic group (p less than 0.01). No differences in behaviors existed between the CIN and high-risk groups. The mean age of menarche in those with CIN was 1 year older than all three non-CIN groups (p less than 0.05), and those with CIN had a greater area of ectopy than those without CIN (p less than 0.02). Those with CIN were more likely to have a past or present history of C. trachomatis infection than the two gynecology clinic groups; no difference was found between the CIN and high-risk groups. We conclude that cofactors such as smoking, sexual promiscuity, and C. trachomatis infection may influence cervical vulnerability. However, cervical biologic immaturity is an important risk factor for development of CIN in adolescent girls.\r"

Of those patients followed for more than three months, 90% of endometrial ablation patients had an improvement in menstrual flow, with 79% having scant or no periods. For patients with submucous fibroids or polyps, 91% had resumption of normal menses. For the 15 patients who were infertile and underwent submucous fibroid or polyp resection the term pregnancy rate is 33% to date. With only two complications in the series (perforation and endometritis), the conclusion is that resection of submucous lesions and endometrial ablation using the resectoscope is a safe and highly effective alternative to hysterectomy for those conditions.\r"

Colpotomy was found to be safe and not to increase morbidity in extensive laparoscopy.\r"

The oocytes were donated voluntarily in stimulated cycles by women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization. If the donors agreed to use ovulation-induction agents and be monitored, they were compensated for their time and inconvenience. Between Nov 15, 1987, and Feb 15, 1988, 194 laparoscopic sterilizations were performed. Only 41 women (21%) met certain of the eligibility criteria. Of the remaining group, only five (12%) agreed to participate. The preliminary results suggest that tubal ligation patients are reluctant to donate oocytes despite enthusiastic counseling, the relatively small risks involved and offers of financial compensation.\r"

Serum testosterone and androstenedione levels were decreased postoperatively, while luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol were increased. It seems that the decrease in intraovarian androgens might have reduced the negative feedback system and thus might have increased the secretion of gonadotropin and estradiol, which in turn promoted ovulation induction and pregnancy.\r"

Postoperatively an IUD was inserted in ten of them and conjugated estrogens administered for 30 days with medroxyprogesterone acetate on days 26-30 (group I); the other ten were given no other therapeutic measures (group II). On follow-up hysterography five women in group I had a normal uterine cavity, and five had a residual fundal notch greater than or equal to 1 cm. In group II four had a normal uterine cavity, and six had a residual fundal notch greater than or equal to 1 cm. No intrauterine adhesions were detected in any of the patients. IUD insertion and hormonal therapy after hysteroscopic metroplasty do not seem to be needed to prevent septal fusion.\r"

Nylon sutures, 8-0, were placed through the muscularis and mucosal layers. A short abdominal incision was made. The patients were followed for 3.5 to 7.0 years. The term delivery, intra-uterine pregnancy, spontaneous abortion and ectopic pregnancy rates were 81.2%, 83.8%, 1.7% and 1.7%, respectively; two ectopic pregnancies occurred 14 and 24 months after the reversal procedures. We found that the time interval between sterilization and reversal and the methods of sterilization affected the pregnancy outcome. The success rate with intervals of less than five years was much higher than with intervals of more than five years; Pomeroy cases were more reversible than Uchida cases. We did not observe any influence of the anastomosis site on the pregnancy results. The term delivery rates for isthmus-isthmus, isthmus-ampulla and ampulla-ampulla anastomoses were 78.8%, 80.0% and 84.6%, respectively. Patients should be followed for two years at least to determine the pregnancy outcome as well as the occurrence of ectopic pregnancy.\r"

Fifteen infertile women were treated at laparoscopy with a Nd:YAG laser; one of six with hydrosalpinx achieved pregnancy after salpingostomy using a contact-type probe, two of three with tubal adhesions achieved pregnancy after adhesiolysis with the Nd:YAG laser, and three of six with polycystic ovaries achieved pregnancy after wedge resection using a contact-type probe. Five of fifteen infertile women conceived after Nd:YAG laser surgery with a contact-type probe under laparoscopy. We confirmed that contact irradiation with a ceramic incising probe is capable of creating an adequate incision at low power levels and that laparoscopic Nd:YAG laser surgery for infertile women is an effective treatment.\r"

However, women without previous surgery can also have adhesions. We compared the incidence of significant adhesions in women with and without histories of abdominal surgery. We also examined the outcomes in each group after 955 laparoscopic sterilizations. Two hundred sixty-three women (28%) had had previous surgery. Of them, 61 (23%) displayed significant adhesions. Of the remaining 692 patients, 19 (2.7%) had significant adhesions. There were no major complications in either group. Thus, a history of previous abdominal or pelvic procedures increased the risk of significant adhesion formation nearly tenfold. Since no major complications occurred in those women, we conclude that while such patients are at increased risk, that risk is not inordinate and does not justify the routine use of minilaparotomy.\r"

Twenty-six healthy subjects of similar age and sex served as controls. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was calculated from the sum of the peak tricuspid insufficiency Doppler pressure gradient and an estimate of right atrial pressure based on inferior vena cava size and its degree of inspiratory collapse. Five patients with SLE (14%) had pulmonary hypertension, defined as pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 30 mm Hg. Cardiac indices determined by planimetry of biplane apical 2-dimensional echocardiographic images were low or normal in the patients with pulmonary hypertension implying increased pulmonary vascular resistance as the etiology for elevated pulmonary artery pressure. The mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure in patients with SLE was 25 +/- 10 mm Hg vs 20 +/- 2 in controls (p = 0.002). No control had a pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 23 mm Hg. Patients with pulmonary hypertension had a shorter duration of SLE and steroid therapy and a higher prevalence of cytotoxic treatment and Raynaud's phenomenon in comparison to those with normal pulmonary artery pressures. The prevalence of systemic hypertension, interstitial lung disease, pleurisy, pericarditis, cutaneous manifestations, arthritis, renal disease, central nervous system involvement, and hematologic abnormalities was similar in patients with SLE with normal and elevated pulmonary artery pressure. Our study suggests that pulmonary hypertension in SLE is common but usually mild.\r"

Once entered into this prospective study the patients were followed for up to 16 months (mean 7.7 +/- 4.72 SD) with periodic determinations of APLA. Of the 500 patients with SLE, 88 had had thrombocytopenia, 25 had had hemolytic anemia, 25 had had both, and 362 had no history of these hemocytopenias. If we considered the odds ratio of these 362 patients for having high titer APLA as 1, patients with a history of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia or both had significantly higher odds ratios of having APLA than did those without hemocytopenia. Patients with thrombocytopenia had significantly higher levels of IgG APLA, those with hemolytic anemia had significantly higher titers of IgM APLA and patients with both had significantly higher titers of both of these APLA isotypes, than did patients without hemocytopenias. A correlation between positive direct Coombs' tests and IgM APLA was also found. We conclude that APLA is associated with these hemocytopenias in SLE. This might be due to their interaction with negatively charged phospholipids in the cell walls of the respective cells.\r"

  ".W": "The outcome of total hip replacement (THR) in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is unclear. Concern has often been voiced by both surgeons and physicians regarding potential reankylosis, mechanical failure and poor function. We present an independent review of the patients' perception of outcome in 150 total hip replacements (138 primary + 12 revisions) in 87 subjects with AS. The mean followup was 7.5 years (1-34 years). Twelve were followed for greater than 15 years and 33 for greater than 10 years. Bilateral replacements were performed in 51 of the 87 patients (59%), 33 (65%) of whom had bilateral surgery within a 12-month period. Failures were early and rare. Twelve of 138 (9%) were revised (8 patients, mean of 3.6 years postoperatively) and 3 of the 12 were rerevisions. Twelve total hip replacements followed for 15 years or more resulted in only 2 failures (same patient: reankylosis) while 3 failed out of 33 followed for 10 years or more. Overall, for the 138 total hip replacements in situ (including the revisions), the patients considered outcome to be good or very good in 86%, while 89% had no (63%) or mild (26%) pain. Mobility was good or very good in 44%. On a scale of 1-5 (very poor to very good) patients followed for up to 5 years scored 4.7, as did those followed for greater than 15 years. Sixty-nine percent of the male recipients under age 60 are at work. Reankylosis occurred in only 1 patient (4 hips). In general the first and second hips replaced had an equally good outcome. The long-term outcome of total hip replacement in AS is very good. The few failures occurred early, and patients were as satisfied with the outcome more than 15 years postoperatively as they were within the first 5 years.\r"

  ".W": "Ischemic necrosis of bone, a frequent complication of glucocorticoid therapy, can result in disability due to bone collapse and destruction. Some investigators have suggested that core decompression of involved marrow benefits patients with early disease. As radiographs are normal in early disease, identification of patients has been dependent on nonspecific radionuclide imaging or more specific but invasive hemodynamic studies. In order to define a sensitive, noninvasive diagnostic tool, we compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to 99mtechnetium diphosphonate and 99mtechnetium sulfur colloid scintigraphy in 10 consecutive glucocorticoid treated patients with suspected femoral head ischemic necrosis of bone but normal roentgenograms. MRI identified the ischemic necrosis (defined by characteristic radiographic progression or histology) in 13/13 femoral heads. Both scans together identified only 5/13 of the cases. Only 1/20 osteoarthritic femoral heads had MRI patterns similar to those seen in ischemic necrosis of bone. We conclude that MRI is a sensitive and relatively specific method to detect early femoral head ischemic necrosis of bone.\r"

The levels of DPD were increased significantly in both RA and OA suggesting accelerated bone degradation in both disease groups. PYD concentrations were also significantly increased in both diseases, but larger increases were detected in patients with RA, for which this index correlated with clinical measures of joint involvement and biochemical variables of inflammatory activity. Cross-sectional studies showed that treatment with disease modifying drugs (gold and D-penicillamine) led to decreased crosslink levels but longterm corticosteroids resulted in increased urinary crosslinks, probably due to the induction of bone resorption. Measurement of both pyridinium crosslinks in urine may therefore provide information on the stage, activity, level of bone involvement and efficacy of drug therapy in arthritic diseases.\r"

Synthetic calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals (CPPD) and several ceramics adsorbed small amounts of IgG and the increment of superoxide production was also small. Both the augmentation of O2- and the adsorption of IgG to hydroxyapatite type I synthetic crystals and the remaining ceramics were intermediate. Synthetic monosodium urate crystals adsorbed the most IgG and the O2- increments were large. The increase in superoxide production correlated with the amount of IgG bound onto crystals or ceramics. The greater protein binding and phlogistic potential of some ceramics needs to be taken into consideration in their clinical use.\r"

PAF was found in almost all carcinoma, although it was not detected in most of the matched, nontumor breast tissue samples. Intratumor PAF level was elevated when axillary lymph node involvement was low. Greater axillary extension (two or more positive lymph nodes) was associated with a decreased intratumor PAF level. These findings, along with the independence of other prognostic factors, indicate that PAF is a tumor marker of axillary lymph node involvement.\r"

Both acids significantly prolonged the life spans of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma-bearing mice and inhibited the growth of Ehrlich solid carcinoma in mice compared with the findings in untreated control mice. Methyl esters of these acids also prolonged the survival of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma-bearing mice, but they were less effective in lengthening the survival of mice given transplants of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. In addition, gas-chromatography analysis of tumor cell lipids showed that appreciable changes occurred in the fatty acid composition of the tumor cell grown in mice treated with oleic acid or linoleic acid. Linoleic acid caused more pronounced alterations in fatty acid composition of tumor cell lipids than did oleic acid, a feature that parallels the intensity of the cytotoxicity potential of the two free fatty acids. These results suggest that (a) the free carboxyl group of free fatty acids plays a role in killing tumor cells and (b) the modification of the fatty acid composition of tumor cells also correlates with the antitumor effects of oleic and linoleic acids. In addition, these results indicate that free fatty acids may be of tumor-oriented distribution; as a consequence, free fatty acids selectively inhibit the growth of tumor cells.\r"

Women with scoliosis represent a valuable population for studying this issue because they are exposed to multiple diagnostic x rays during childhood and adolescence, times when the breast may be highly sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of radiation. A study was conducted of 1,030 women with scoliosis who were seen at four Minneapolis area medical facilities between 1935 and 1965. The average age at diagnosis was 12.3 years; 60% of the women had idiopathic scoliosis. Individual x-ray films were counted and the number per patient ranged from 0 to 618 films (mean, 41.5). On average, the x-ray exposures were given over an 8.7-year period. Ninety percent of the women were located, of whom over 92% responded to a mail questionnaire or telephone interview. The average period of observation was 26 years. Overall, 11 cases of breast cancer were reported, compared with six expected (standardized incidence ratio = 1.82, 90% confidence interval = 1.0-3.0). Excess risk increased with time since exposure and was highest among those followed for more than 30 years (standardized incidence ratio = 2.4). Risk also increased with the number of x rays and with the estimated radiation dose to the breast (mean, 13 rad). These data suggest that frequent exposure to low-level diagnostic radiation during childhood or adolescence may increase the risk of breast cancer.\r"

By 1986, after 1,137,415 person-years of follow-up, we had documented 1,799 newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer. Compared with the risk of breast cancer for nonusers of oral contraceptives, the multivariate relative risks were 1.07 (95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.19) for all users, 1.06 (95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.18) for past users, and 1.53 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.19) for current users--women who used oral contraceptives up to 2 years before diagnosis of breast cancer. We conclude that overall past use of oral contraceptives is not associated with a substantial increase in the risk of breast cancer. Although we did not find women who used oral contraceptives before the first pregnancy to have an increased risk of breast cancer, the number of women who used oral contraceptives for a long duration in early reproductive life was too small to permit firm conclusions regarding the risk in this subgroup.\r"

Stereotaxic implantation of 9L gliosarcoma cells (5 X 10(5) into the CSF of the lateral cerebral ventricle resulted in widespread dissemination and median survival of 18.5 and 20 days (range, 10-22) in two experiments. A continuous 7-day infusion of IUDR into the CSF starting on the day of tumor implantation did not provide any beneficial effect. Irradiation of the cranial spinal axis with 800 rad on days 4, 6, and 7 after implantation achieved an increase in survival time that was modest but statistically significant. However, the combination of IUDR infusion and radiotherapy resulted in marked improvement in survival time and a 10% cure rate (two of 20 rats). This is the first demonstration in vivo that IUDR administered into the CSF can be a potent radiosensitizer.\r"

  ".U": "89362587\r", 
  ".W": "Aldosterone is a major regulator of fluid and electrolyte balance after hemorrhage and is released from the adrenal cortex by the action of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and angiotensin II (AII). Past work has shown that the hemorrhage-induced release of ACTH and cortisol is potentiated by prior hemorrhage. We therefore studied the response of adrenal aldosterone secretion to repeated hemorrhage and its control by ACTH and AII. Six awake dogs with chronic lumboadrenal vein catheters were bled 10% of measured blood volume (H1) with reinfusion at 30 minutes. The hemorrhage was repeated 5 hours later (H2). Adrenal presentation rates for AII (AII-PR) and ACTH (ACTH-PR) were calculated for each sample. Control hormonal and hemodynamic parameters before each hemorrhage were not different; hemodynamic responses to H1 and H2 did not differ. Aldosterone secretion increased significantly after each hemorrhage. The increase in aldosterone secretion after H1 was associated with an early increase in AII-PR and late increase in ACTH-PR. Aldosterone secretion following H2 was greater than that following H1 and was associated with early and larger responses of AII-PR and ACTH-PR. Aldosterone secretion following H1 correlated with the AII-PR (r = 0.75; p less than 0.001), but not with the ACTH-PR. In contrast, aldosterone secretion following H2 correlated with both the AII-PR (r = 0.54; p less than 0.01) and ACTH-PR (r = 0.71; p less than 0.001) and multiple regression analysis showed a highly significant relation with both AII and ACTH (r = 0.81; p less than 0.001). The data suggest that aldosterone secretion after initial small hemorrhage occurs as a result of increased AII, whereas both AII and ACTH may contribute to the larger aldosterone secretory response to H2. Since major trauma commonly involves at least two insults separated in time (e.g., injury followed by surgery), potentiated responses of aldosterone and other pituitary-adrenal hormones (ACTH, vasopressin, and cortisol) may have important implications for the control of fluid and electrolyte balance and metabolism in injured patients.\r"

This paper analyzes the causes, incidence, and mortality in 16,524 patients (33.6% of the trauma center patients) with injury to the brain or skull and compares them to patients without head injury. Relative to its incidence, patients with head injury composed a disproportionately high percentage (60%) of all the deaths. This was due to the high mortality rate for head-injured patients. Overall mortality of patients with head injury (18.2%) was three times higher than if no head injury occurred (6.1%). This mortality was little influenced by extracranial injuries except when minor and moderate head injuries were accompanied by very severe (AIS levels 4 to 6) injuries elsewhere. The cause of death in head-injured patients was approximated and it was found that 67.8% were due to head injury, 6.6% to extracranial injury, and 25.6% to both. Head injury is thus associated with more deaths (3,010 vs. 1,972) than all other injuries and causes almost as many deaths (2,040 vs. 2,170) as extracranial injuries. Because of its high mortality, head injury is the single largest contributor to trauma center deaths.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous national trauma leaders have expressed concern about the lack of uniformity of trauma training in this country. In 1984 we instituted a trauma rotation between the University of Louisville (U.L.), with a large trauma volume, and Loyola University (L.U.) in the planning stages of trauma center development. Third year L.U. residents rotated at U.L. in 3-month blocks with an increased level of responsibility monthly, culminating in major decision-making roles and operative treatment under the chief resident's direction. The L.U. residents functioned as full members of the team and not as passive observers. Fifteen L.U. residents and 12 U.L. residents rotated during this period. Yearly major trauma visits, helicopter flights, and trauma service admissions average 1,908, 700, and 1,520, respectively. U.L. chief residents averaged 136 major operative trauma cases and 115 nonoperative trauma cases each were managed during this time period (RRC records greater than 85th percentile for all U.L. residents). L.U. residents performed an average of 30 major operative cases, nine as teaching assistant, in 3 months. Each managed more than 75 nonoperative cases. Several elements are critical in such a multi-institutional rotation: 1) active communication among the program directors, 2) commitment to one sharing arrangement only, 3) financing and malpractice for off-site residents, 4) housing, and 5) the ability to assimilate off-site residents as true trauma team members. The resident-to-resident interplay is crucial and has succeeded because both residency staffs have had excellent early training.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89362591\r", 
  ".W": "Conservative splenic surgery such as partial splenectomy is advocated for splenic injuries, since splenectomy predisposes individuals to overwhelming sepsis with encapsulated organisms, of which Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequently isolated. The respiratory route is argued to be the most likely portal of entry of pneumococci; however, little data exist on the interaction of the spleen and pulmonary defense mechanisms against pneumococcal invasion. We studied the effect of splenectomy, 50% splenectomy (hemisplenectomy), 25% splenectomy, and sham operation on in vivo clearance of live pneumococci from the lungs of male CD-1 mice following an aerosol challenge of pneumococci. Splenectomy impaired pneumococcal clearance from mouse lung pairs and allowed for increased translocation of live pneumococci to tracheobronchial lymph nodes compared to sham-operated controls. Preservation of splenic mass by partial splenectomy improved lung clearance and allowed for fewer bacteria to be cultured from tracheobronchial lymph nodes compared to splenectomized animals. Clearance of live pneumococci from the lungs and survival were directly proportional to the amount of splenic tissue remaining. Splenic factors probably exist which regulate reticuloendothelial cell function throughout the host. Maintaining adequate splenic mass, therefore, is an important consideration when operating for splenic trauma.\r"

These physicians usually have little or no training in the forensic aspects of emergency medical care and therefore necessary evidence may often be overlooked, lost, inadvertently discarded, or its admissibility denied because of improper handling or documentation. Criteria were developed to evaluate the forensic medical aspects of such trauma cases and to discern the magnitude of the problem. The majority of the cases reviewed demonstrated significant forensic medical deficiencies primarily in the areas of documentation and/or handling or securing of evidence. Trauma physicians have the responsibility and potential liability to insure that necessary evidence is properly secured and preserved while caring for their patients. Educational programs should be developed for this purpose.\r"

Thirty (17.8%) of the 169 patients were operated upon because of clinical concern. Injuries were found in two of these patients: a diaphragmatic injury in one and a combined diaphragmatic and liver injury in the other. None of the 139 patients observed developed any sequelae. Twenty of the 33 patients with a positive CT were taken to the operating room where 16 were found to have a significant injury. Seven of these 16 patients had additional injuries not identified on CT. There were four false positive scans. Thirteen patients with a positive scan and two patients with an equivocal scan were observed based upon clinical judgment. Ten of these 15 patients had minor isolated renal or hepatic injuries seen on scan. None of these developed complications. It is concluded that abdominal computed tomography, with a sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 98%, and accuracy of 97% is a reliable study in the evaluation of patients with stab wounds to the back.\r"

Bacteria translocated to the MLNs of Balb/c but not the CD-1 or C57/bl mice receiving 25% body burns. The increased incidence of bacterial translocation in the burned Balb/c mice appeared to be due to a burn-induced gut mucosal injury, since the intestinal mucosa of the Balb/c but not the CD-1 or C57/bl mice was damaged 24 hr after the thermal injury. The mucosal injury appears to be mediated, at least in part, by xanthine oxidase-generated oxygen-free radicals, since inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity with allopurinol, or inactivation of xanthine oxidase activity by a molybdenum-free tungsten diet, prevented the mucosal injury and reduced the extent of bacterial translocation.\r"

Falls represented the seventh leading cause of traumatic death in all children 15 years of age or younger, but the third leading cause of death in children 1 to 4 years old. The mean age of those with accidental falls was 2.3 years, which is markedly younger than that seen in hospital admission series, suggesting that infants are much more likely to die from a fall than older children. Forty-one per cent of the deaths occurred from \"minor\" falls such as falls from furniture or while playing; 50% were falls from a height of one story or greater; the remainder were falls down stairs. Of children falling from less than five stories, death was due to a lethal head injury in 86%. Additionally, 61.3% of the children with head injuries had mass lesions which would have required acute neurosurgical intervention. The need for an organized pediatric trauma system is demonstrated as more than one third of the children were transferred to another hospital, with more than half of these deteriorating during the delay. Of the patients with \"minor\" falls, 38% had parental delay in seeking medical attention, with deterioration of all. The trauma system must also incorporate the education of parents and medical personnel to the potential lethality of \"minor\" falls in infants and must legislate injury prevention programs.\r"

After a minimum of 1 week washout, the volunteers ingested an identical ethanol dose but in addition received 60 grams of SAC and 300 ml of 5.8% magnesium citrate solution 1 and 3 hours post ingestion. The data was compared using the paired t-test with p less than 0.05 considered significant. Nine volunteers completed the study. Volunteers had difficulty ingesting the full second 60 gram SAC dose. The AUC (mean 1184 mcg x hr/ml) and highest ethanol concentrations (mean 46.3 mg/dl) for the control group were not significantly greater than in the SAC group (mean AUC 1167 mcg x hr/ml and highest ethanol concentration of 49.0 mg/dl). The ethanol concentration in the SAC group was significantly less than control only at 2.0 hours (31.6 mg/dl vs 36.6 mg/dl, p less than 0.01). The peak ethanol concentration in the SAC group occurred at 1.0 hours in 7 of 9 volunteers, while in the control group, peak concentration occurred randomly between 0.5 and 2.0 hours. We conclude SAC in the dose used is not effective in decreasing AUC, highest ethanol concentration, and blood ethanol levels when given 1 and 3 hours after ethanol ingestion.\r"

Serial samples of blood and urine were collected from two 3 kg rabbits after arterial injection of 2 mg 3H-DMI and, about 1.5 hr later, after injection of approximately 1 g Fab (prepared from sheep total IgG). Protein-free filtrates of serum and urine samples were obtained by ultrafiltration; concentrations of apparent total and apparent free DMI (apparent DMI, aDMI = DMI + metabolites) were calculated based on the radioactivity in the sample and ultrafiltrate, respectively. Treatment with Fab induced significant changes in the absolute and relative concentrations of free and total aDMI in both serum and urine. Changes in the serum included increases in the total and free aDMI levels. Changes in the urine included the appearances of a protein-bound aDMI fraction and Fab, and an increase in the percent of unmetabolized DMI. These results demonstrate that TCA-specific Fab influence the distribution and elimination of desipramine in DMI-treated rabbits and suggest that further studies on the use of TCA-specific Fab for antidotal treatment of TCA overdose are warranted.\r"

This one year retrospective audit of patients presenting with a history of recent toxic ingestion was designed to determine the time to stool of a charcoal/sorbitol slurry (CSS) when used for differing ingestants. A total of 69 patients received a CSS. 50.7% took less than 6 hours for their first charcoal stool, while 26.1% had emesis of the CSS within 30 minutes of administration. Ingestion of drugs which may increase gastrointestinal transit time (i.e. opioids, cyclic antidepressants) correlated with prolonged time to stool despite treatment with the CSS. Though a prospective, controlled study needs to be performed, variation in dosage of the CSS may be appropriate in select patient groups to offset the effects of the ingestant on bowel motility.\r"

  ".W": "Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy monotherapy was performed in 642 patients for 1 year with an EDAP-LT01 piezoelectric lithotriptor. Of 642 patients 398 completed extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy treatment and 244 still are undergoing multiple extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy sessions. The 398 patients had renal (64.6 per cent) or ureteral (35.4 per cent) stones 0.6 to 4.8 cm. in diameter (mean 1.4 cm.). No general or regional anesthesia was required except in 7 children. Among 398 patients who completed extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy the rate free of stones was 73.4 per cent and the rate of clinically insignificant residual fragments was 12.8 per cent. The success rate (rate free of calculi plus that of clinically insignificant renal fragments) ranged from 95.6 per cent for stones 0.6 to 1.0 cm. in diameter to 52.6 per cent for stones larger than 3.0 cm. (mean 86.2 per cent). The number of treatment sessions in 343 patients with successful results increased in accordance with the stone size, with an average of 1.6 sessions. Double-J* stents were placed in 7 patients and ureteral catheterization was performed in 11 as post-extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy adjunctive measures. The steinstrasse phenomenon was noted in 14 patients, of whom only 1 required Double-J stenting. There were no significant complications. Therefore, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy monotherapy with the piezoelectric lithotriptor is considered to be a safe and efficient outpatient procedure for the initial treatment of urinary stones regardless of stone sizes.\r"

The experience with use of 2 Wolf Piezolith machines for 1 year is presented. Different second generation lithotriptors have varying techniques of production of shock waves and different imaging methods. The Wolf Piezolith device uses ultrasound imaging and piezoelectric crystals for shock wave generation. Between June 1987 and May 1988, 545 patients 5 to 84 years old were treated with the Wolf Piezolith device. Of these patients 2-month followup data are available for 367 (398 renal units). Outpatient treatment was used routinely. For renal calculi complete fragmentation (into particles less than 2 mm. in size) was achieved in 94 per cent of the patients, with 53 per cent being completely free of stone at 2 months. For ureteral stones treated in situ the best results were obtained in the upper and lower ureter. Over-all, 62 per cent of the patients required more than 1 treatment, with the number of treatment sessions required increasing with the size of the stone treated. Morbidity was low. Ultrasound imaging has proved to be as effective as x-ray imaging. Compared to Dornier HM-3 lithotripsy, installation and running costs were low. The machine offers a favorable alternative to first generation lithotriptors.\r"

Of these patients 14 were treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy; the calculi in 2 could not be localized and focused at the F2 focal point, and 1 was asymptomatic and has been followed conservatively. Four patients required repeat extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Adjunctive procedures included preoperative retrograde catheter placement (5 patients), postoperative percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (1), ureteroscopy for ureteral fragments (2) and placement of a double pigtail stent (1). Of 14 patients 11 (79 per cent) have been rendered free of fragments with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and adjunctive measures as needed. We conclude that most patients with calculi in a horseshoe kidney can be managed primarily with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.\r"

It is proposed that bilateral tumors are distinct genetically from unilateral tumors and that most bilateral tumors have a genetic propensity to either enhanced metastatic spread to other renal tissue or spontaneous degeneration.\r"

In contrast, 19 of the bladder cancer patients produced 26 gastrointestinal lesions, including 5 carcinomas. The latter incidence is higher than expected in our population. This difference between the 2 sets of patients in regard to skin and gastrointestinal lesions is statistically significant. Few gynecological lesions were noted in either group but a common factor was human papillomavirus infection, as indicated by the presence of koilocytosis. The latter also was present in 17 per cent of 41 otherwise negative smears from patients with bladder neoplasia, that is considerably more than expected (less than 1 per cent), and is similar to that reported previously in patients with melanoma.\r"

Of all treated patients 78 per cent responded to initial therapy, with a followup of 13 to 120 months (median 67 months). Of the 18 patients who failed 10 were treated with repeat, intensified courses. Nine patients who had recurrent tumors within 3 to 30 months after initiation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy (median 6 months) eventually ceased having recurrence. Status free of disease in the 9 patients ranged from 25 to 90 months since the last recurrence (median 64 months). With retreatment of some of the early failures, the initial success rate of 78 per cent was increased to 89 per cent. These data support the concept that intravesical immunotherapy with bacillus Calmette-Guerin should be repeated in patients who initially appear not to respond. The data also suggest that bacillus Calmette-Guerin induces a durable beneficial response rather than simply delays eventual tumor recurrence.\r"

During tumescence and full erection the electrical activity of the corpus cavernosum almost ceased but in the diabetic patient (neurogenic impotence) an increase was observed. This discoordination might be the cause of the erectile dysfunction. Recording the electrical activity of the corpus cavernosum in patients with suspected neurogenic erectile dysfunction could become clinically valuable, since this is the first test possible to study the function of the autonomic motor system that normally regulates penile function.\r"

Among these 14 patients 11 used the device at home for a minimum of 30 days after an acceptable office demonstration. Three patients did not desire the negative pressure device after an office visit test. Of the 11 home users 10 (91 per cent) reported at least satisfactory erections and successful intercourse. Interestingly, 5 of 6 patients in whom explantation was due to infection were able to use the negative pressure device successfully. Over-all, 10 of the 14 explant patients (71 per cent) engaged in regular successful intercourse using the device. The negative-pressure device can be a useful therapy for erectile impotence even in the sometimes challenging explant population. Despite previous corporeal infection and presumed fibrosis, negative pressure devices can provide patients with a functional erection-like state.\r"

Continence was graded as good or satisfactory in 95 per cent of the patients and poor in 5 per cent. The penile implants were functional in 98 per cent of the patients. Of the 60 patients 33 required 59 corrections, for an average of 0.98 correction per patient.

Urethral erosion was a late complication, 80 per cent (4 of 5) of the time in our series, that usually presented several months after implantation of the prosthesis. We believe that the etiological factors that contributed to this disastrous complication were the friction and inflammation associated with catheterization. We currently construct a perineal urethrostomy in patients who desire a penile prosthesis and who perform intermittent catheterization. If intermittent catheterization is not feasible, insertion of a suprapubic tube is recommended. We additionally recommend insertion of an inflatable penile prosthesis, since this type is relatively soft most of the time and will not cause as much pressure at the end of the penis. Since instituting these procedures we have not encountered any erosion.\r"

At exploration 44 per cent of the group 1 patients required orchiectomy versus 8 per cent in group 2. Patients less than 18 years old are a high risk group for testicular loss after torsion and represent more than 90 per cent of the orchiectomies performed. We believe that this group should be targeted for improved health education, emphasizing early evaluation of scrotal pain to improve testicular salvage.\r"

The patients, who had been treated surgically when they were 2 to 5 or 9 to 12 years old and who were examined when they were 18 to 39 years old, were divided into 4 groups: group 1 (61 patients) underwent bilateral orchiopexy, group 2 (149) underwent unilateral orchiopexy, group 3 (26) underwent unilateral orchiectomy and group 4 (38) received no surgical treatment for a unilateral undescended testis. Significant differences in the sperm density and motility were detected between group 1 (normal range 0 to 7 per cent) and group 2 or 3 (normal range 72 to 79 per cent), and between group 2 or 3 and group 4 (normal range 42 to 58 per cent). Histopathological differences were significant between group 1 or 2 (Johnsen's score count 6.06 to 6.11) and group 4 (4.72) for the affected side, and between group 2 or 3 (9.09 to 9.20) and group 4 (8.60) for the unaffected side. The results suggest that surgical treatment may not significantly ameliorate the fertility potential of patients with bilateral undescended testes. On the other hand, in patients with unilateral undescended testis an operation not later than at early puberty is advisable to maintain the spermatogenic function in the unaffected testis. It is suggested that some unknown factors relating to the highly impaired unilateral undescended testis may in some way inhibit function of the contralateral unaffected testis.\r"

  ".W": "In 176 radical prostatectomy specimens areas of capsule penetration by cancer and positive surgical margins were quantified and located over the prostate surface. The presence of cancer within the perineural space was sought in these areas and compared to the normal distribution of prostatic nerve branches. Capsule penetration was found in 78 of 156 stage B carcinomas, and in 39 of these 78 (50 per cent) it occurred entirely by cancer extension through the capsule within perineural spaces. In the remaining 39 prostates capsule penetration by perineural space invasion predominated but direct spread also was found. Most often, perineural space invasion followed the oblique vertical course of nerve branches that extended superiorly to the superior pedicle near the prostate base. In such cases capsule penetration areas were localized near the superior margin of the cancer, and in 11 per cent positive superior pedicle margins resulted from continued perineural space invasion outside the capsule. In cancers near the prostate apex capsule penetration by perineural space invasion produced positive margins in 89 per cent of 18 cases because of the short inferior pedicle. The role of perineural space invasion by cancer was less prominent in 4 of 20 stage A cancers that showed capsule penetration.\r"

Autopsy findings also were reviewed. Of the patients 84 per cent had no complaints referable to the urinary system, 2 per cent had gross hematuria (all with a negative diagnostic evaluation) and 14 per cent had urinary infections. We conclude that only a small percentage of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome suffer from significant urological manifestations and that a full urological evaluation of such patients generally is not warranted. If the patient presents with gross hematuria excretory urography should be performed if there is no infectious etiology, and cytoscopy should be performed only if the hematuria is life-threatening or prolonged and possibly to confirm significant urographic findings.\r"

This system has been evaluated in 19 studies performed on 15 patients. The mean duration of the studies was 3 hours 51 minutes (standard deviation +/- 1 hour 3 minutes) and the mean number of voids per patient was 3.8 +/- 2.2. Visual inspection of the recorded data showed that subtraction of the rectal trace from the bladder trace provided a useful detrusor trace when subjects were ambulant as well as resting. When ambulant, movement caused typical peak-to-peak pressure variability in the bladder and rectal traces of approximately 30 +/- 20 cm. water (mean and standard deviation of peak-to-peak pressure for typical ambulant 5-minute sections for each patient), which after subtraction was reduced on the detrusor trace to 10 +/- 5 cm. water. The equivalent figures when resting were 9 +/- 5 cm. water, subtracting to less than 5 cm. water for the detrusor. Further measurements also were calculated for the whole of each trace. The system provided good quality recordings and should prove useful in future evaluations of natural fill urodynamic studies.\r"

After prostatic resection improved voiding was documented in most physiological parameters. However, the total work capacity of the bladder remained constant and appeared to be a fixed property of the healthy bladder. An increase in the volume voided postoperatively was related to an increase in the bladder capacity associated with a decrease in detrusor instability, and was not related to a decrease in residual urine.\r"

These children did not have hydronephrosis, renal failure or urinary tract obstruction. In all cases both studies were conducted within a 10-month period. The findings from both modalities were in agreement for 51 of the 64 renal units evaluated (80 per cent). Evaluation of the excretory urogram indicated 6 cases of diffuse and 2 of focal scarring that were not detected by evaluation of the renal scan. The sensitivity of excretory urography to detect renal scars was 84 per cent and the specificity was 83 per cent. The 99mtechnetium-dimercapto-succinic acid renal scan showed 5 cases of focal renal scarring not detected by excretory urography. The sensitivity of the renal scan to detect renal scars was 77 per cent and the specificity was 75 per cent. We conclude that neither study alone could effectively replace the other for the detection of renal scars, and recommend that both be included in the initial evaluation and followup of patients with renal scars.\r"

Primary anatomical bladder closure was performed in 137 patients, of whom 42 (31 per cent) eventually required urinary diversion. Primary urinary diversion was the initial treatment in 70 patients, including ureterosigmoidostomy in 40, ileal conduit in 17, colon conduit in 11 and cutaneous ureterostomy in 2. Secondary urinary diversion was necessary in 35 patients and included continent diversion in 7. Primary anatomical bladder closure, done within 72 hours of birth and followed by staged reconstruction of the bladder neck, was the most successful surgical regimen for the treatment of bladder exstrophy. Acceptable urinary continence was achieved in 82 per cent of our patients with this approach. However, multiple procedures often were required to achieve continence.\r"

Of 20 patients with the prune belly syndrome treated at our institution during the last 18 years 15 underwent comprehensive reconstruction. Abdominoplasty was performed in 16 patients. Results were evaluated as to cosmetic appearance, functional performance, and preoperative and postoperative electromyography. Immediate good results were obtained in 9 patients. Of 16 patients 6 required more than 1 abdominal wall tailoring and 3 had minor complications that did not compromise the ultimate result. Transabdominal orchiopexy was performed on 32 testes; 28 (88 per cent) are in the scrotum and growing. Of the 4 failures 3 occurred in patients greater than 2 years old at repair. Selective urinary tract reconstruction has been performed; 13 patients underwent tapering and reimplantation of 1 or both ureters. Reduction cystoplasty was done in all 15 patients. Functional assessment of the upper urinary tract by improved radiological techniques and the necessity for long-term antibiotic prophylaxis have led to a more conservative approach in 5 recent patients. Renal function as measured by serum creatinine and/or glomerular filtration rate has remained stable in 12 of 15 patients (92 per cent) undergoing comprehensive reconstruction. Aggressive surgical management of patients with the prune belly syndrome provides improved abdominal wall function and appearance, and offers excellent testicular salvage. Surgical reconstruction of deformed ureters should be selective and decided on longitudinal studies of renal function.\r"

  ".U": "89362702\r", 
  ".W": "The gubernaculum testis is a loose connective tissue organ that plays an essential mechanical role in testicular descent. In the pig, the first phase of descent (transabdominal migration) is brought about by growth of the gubernaculum through the inguinal canal into the scrotum and simultaneous somatic growth of the fetus. During the second phase the gubernaculum condenses, thus allowing the testis to descend into the scrotum. The nature of gubernaculum development (growth and differentiation) was investigated with respect to cell proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, and acid hydrolases. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was used as a measure of cell number and hydroxyproline (HYP) was an estimate of interstitial collagen. The first phase of gubernaculum development was characterized by rapid cell proliferation and concomitant synthesis of sulphated glycosaminoglycans (S-GAG), hyaluronic acid (HA) and collagen. During the second phase cell proliferation ceased and DNA concentration increased. The amount of S-GAG remained closely related to the amount of DNA while HYP increased further. However, HA decreased during the second phase and thus HA metabolism seems to play a crucial role in biphasic development of the gubernaculum. The activities of the enzymes that are needed for biodegradation of HA (hyaluronidase, beta-glucuronidase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase) were measured in gubernaculum homogenate from animals during the first and second phase of testicular descent. These enzymes were detectable in gubernaculum and rose during the second phase of testicular descent. It was concluded that a very distinct dichotomy in the nature of gubernaculum development during the first and second phase could be discerned with respect to cell proliferation rate and ECM synthesis and degradation. These observations provide useful tools for future in vivo and in vitro investigations into the process and regulation of testicular descent.\r"

Mice infected with Semliki Forest Virus showed a decreased body weight when compared with control animals, although their bladders were proportionately heavier. The pharmacological results indicated a selective change in purinergic transmission in the bladders of mice infected with Semliki Forest Virus, while cholinergic transmission remained unchanged. This was demonstrated by a significant increase in the contractile response to beta,gamma-methylene ATP accompanied by an increase in the proportion of the nerve-mediated response blocked by alpha,beta-methylene ATP. In contrast, the contractile response to acetylcholine and the atropine-sensitive component of the neurogenic response were not significantly different between the two groups of animals. Active length-tension curves were also unchanged in the mice infected with Semliki Forest Virus when compared with controls. The results are discussed in relation to those obtained from models of urinary bladder dysfunction associated with hypertrophy; whether the alteration of atropine-resistant (purinergic) function reported here is a general secondary feature of this type of bladder dysfunction or a change specific to the Semliki Forest Virus model of multiple sclerosis is not resolved. This study provides evidence that peripheral changes as well as central nervous system demyelination occur in the Semliki Forest Virus-infected mouse.\r"

A four-channel catheter with one side-hole per channel was used to measure four UPP's simultaneously in different directions. The dynamic properties of the system have been improved significantly by replacing the conventional perfusion system by a pneumo-hydraulic perfusion system, according to the design of Arndorfer. The UPP's thus obtained consistently show multiple peaks which depend on catheter orientation. These observations are explained in terms of the presence of several symmetrical as well as asymmetrical muscles in and around the canine urethral wall. Clinical application of the developed technique is expected to yield new information on the functional anatomy of the human urethra.\r"

  ".W": "Although the use of ileocystoplasty has increased significantly in recent years, very little is known concerning the smooth muscle properties of the implanted bowel segment. In a previous study, preliminary evidence was presented which indicated that the pharmacological response of the cytoplastic ileal segment to autonomic agonists changed toward that of the bladder. The present study extends and expands these preliminary observations on the physiology and pharmacology of augmentation cystoplasty. Augmentation cystoplasty with detubularized ileum was carried out in 16 rabbits. In vivo and in vitro physiological and pharmacological studies were carried out one and three months after surgery. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) in-vivo CMG at one month was similar to that of the preoperative bladder, but at three months there was a 24% increase in capacity, with the presence of multiple phasic contractions beginning at a volume of approximately 65% of capacity. 2) The frequency and magnitude of spontaneous activity in the cystoplastic ileum did not significantly alter from that of the normal ileum. 3) Cystoplastic ileum responded to muscarinic stimulation differently from the normal ileum. The bladder responded with an increase in the tension whereas the ileum responded with an increase in the frequency and amplitude of phasic contractions. The cystoplastic ileum responded with a pronounced sustained contraction with phasic contractions superimposed. The tonic contraction at three months was of a significantly greater magnitude than that at one month. 4) The qualitative and quantitative response to field stimulation of the cystoplastic ileum was altered from that of the ileum towards that of the bladder. 5) The normal bladder contains greater amount of creatine phosphate and lesser amounts of creatine than the normal ileum. Cystoplasty, after three months induced a change in the ileal segment towards the bladder (increased creatine phosphate and decreased creatine). 6) The normal ileum was found to have greater number of muscarinic receptors than the normal bladder whereas the cystoplastic ileum at three months was intermediate.\r"

  ".W": "Light activation of dihematoporphyrin ether (photofrin II) has been used in the treatment of bladder tumors, yet the effects of this treatment on the normal urinary bladder microcirculation have not been determined. This study involved the use of in vivo television microscopy to observe the effects of light activation (530 to 560 nm., 175 mW/cm.) on the urinary bladder microcirculation of female Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals pretreated with dihematoporphyrin ether 30 minutes prior to light activation had high serum and low tissue concentrations of the photosensitizer and activation resulted in a statistically significant reduction of red blood cell column diameter in both arterioles and venules. The reduction was primarily due to mural thrombus formation with the occlusion remaining 60 minutes after activation. Animals pretreated 48 hours before activation had low serum and high tissue concentrations of dihematoporphyrin ether and activation had no microcirculatory effects apart from occasional platelet aggregation. These results suggest that the photodynamic effect on normal (non-neoplastic) tissue treated more than 48 hours after administration of dihematoporphyrin ether is probably due to a direct effect of light and the sensitizer on the smooth muscle of the bladder rather than an effect on the microcirculation.\r"

The role of neuroreceptors in the development of detrusor dysfunction has not been studied previously. Control bladder tissue specimens were obtained from eight children with ureterovesical reflux undergoing ureteral reimplantation and 14 adults with bladder carcinoma undergoing cystectomy. Neurogenic bladder specimens were obtained from 10 children with myelomeningocele and five adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction undergoing augmentation cystoplasty. Saturation experiments using 3H-N-methylscopolamine (3H-NMS) were performed in these control and neurogenic bladder homogenates. The mean equilibrium dissociation constants in the neurogenic and control bladders were 0.41 nM and 0.55 nM, respectively. The mean density of muscarinic cholinergic (MCh) receptor binding sites in the neurogenic and control bladders was 0.34 fmol/mg wet wt. and 0.65 fmol/mg. wet wt., respectively. Competitive binding experiments with 3H-NMS and various unlabelled MCh antagonists indicated that the pharmacology of MCh binding sites was similar in neurogenic and control bladders. Age was not significantly correlated with MCh receptor density in the control and neurogenic bladders. Muscarinic cholinergic binding sites are homogeneous in neurogenic and control bladders. The lower density of MCh receptors in the neurogenic bladders may represent down regulation of MCh receptors or a replacement of smooth muscle by fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "The microvascular architecture of the human corpus cavernosum penis was studied by scanning electron microscopy of vascular corrosion casts. The corpus cavernosum was supplied by the penile deep artery. It gave off branches to become either arteries distributed within the corpus cavernosum or those directly supplying the corpus spongiosum urethrae. The former arteries further divided into small arteries which fell into two categories: 1) arteries breaking up into capillaries, and 2) arteries draining directly into the cavernous sinuses. The capillaries were collected into venular networks just beneath the tunica albuginea (the subalbugineal venular plexus), while the cavernous sinuses were collected into venules at the periphery of the corpus cavernosum. These postcavernous venules also received venules from the subalbugineal venular plexus, and left the corpus cavernosum. Thus, two circulatory routes are evident within the corpus cavernosum. These findings suggested that the penile erectile cycle is controlled by hemodynamic changes between these two routes within the corpus cavernosum.\r"

Normal prostatic specimens contained 15.18 +/- 10.03 ng./gm. wet weight (mean +/- S.D., n = 20), with a range of 1.50 to 39.62 ng./gm. The result for the hyperplastic tissue samples (n = 20) averaged 0.63 +/- 0.39 ng./gm. with a range of 0.22 to 1.49 ng./gm. This difference was statistically significant (p less than .0001). Dilution profiles for the prostatic calcitonin and synthetic monomeric human calcitonin were congruent, suggesting that the two peptides are identical. A comparison of calcitonin levels and the number of immunohistochemically derived neuroendocrine cells in contiguous tissue sections showed an empiric correlation. The mean calcitonin level in normal human prostate tissue was found to exceed values previously reported for numerous other organs, with the exception of the thyroid gland, the principal source of circulating calcitonin. We propose that a subpopulation of neuroendocrine cells within the prostate gland produce calcitonin, as is the case in the gastrointestinal tract, lung, and other organs. Our findings also support the hypothesis that the calcitonin found in seminal fluid originates in the prostate. Putative roles for calcitonin in the genitourinary system are discussed.\r"

In the same years the rate for 1500- to 2499-g infants went from 21% to 26% and the rate for 2500- to 7000-g infants went from 14% to 18%. We studied first-day death rates in very low-birth weight infants as an indicator of potential benefit from this increase in cesarean sections. During the 5-year period first-day deaths averaged 10% and 22% in the cesarean and vaginal birth groups, respectively. This difference was explained almost entirely by deaths in the 500- to 740-g birth weight group, where the death rates were 33% and 59%, respectively. Although this difference remained statistically significant after adjustment for gestational age and other factors that differed between the groups, it was nullified by an excess of deaths in the succeeding 6 days of life. Overall, the odds of death in the first week in these infants weighing 500 to 749 g was 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.39) in the cesarean vs vaginal deliveries. We conclude that there is little evidence that the use of cesarean section for the delivery of very low-birth weight infants, independent of maternal or fetal compromise, improves overall survival. We were unable to find reasons to justify the sharp increase in the use of cesarean sections for these small infants.\r"

  ".W": "As part of the National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area study, 7954 respondents were questioned at baseline and 1 year later about sleep complaints and psychiatric symptoms using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Of this community sample, 10.2% and 3.2% noted insomnia and hypersomnia, respectively, at the first interview. Forty percent of those with insomnia and 46.5% of those with hypersomnia had a psychiatric disorder compared with 16.4% of those with no sleep complaints. The risk of developing new major depression was much higher in those who had insomnia at both interviews compared with those without insomnia (odds ratio, 39.8; 95% confidence interval, 19.8 to 80.0). The risk of developing new major depression was much less for those who had insomnia that had resolved by the second visit (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 5.3). Further research is needed to determine if early recognition and treatment of sleep disturbances can prevent future psychiatric disorders.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the higher prevalence of diabetes found among blacks in the United States is explained by racial differences in obesity, we examined the prevalence of diabetes adjusted for adiposity, education, and income in a cohort of US Army veterans from the Vietnam era. Among 12,558 white men and 1677 black men, aged 30 to 47 years, blacks were more likely than whites to have diagnosed diabetes (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.7). Within every age, adiposity, and socioeconomic stratum, blacks had a higher prevalence of diagnosed diabetes than whites. In a subgroup of veterans for whom fasting serum glucose values were measured, blacks were more likely than whites to have fasting hyperglycemia (fasting serum glucose value greater than or equal to 7.8 mmol/L) (adjusted prevalence ratio, 5.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.7 to 12.0). These data provide evidence that the higher prevalence of diabetes found among blacks is not explained by differences in obesity.\r"

  ".W": "By combining data from the National Center for Health Statistics and computerized searching of news stories, we identified 157 dog bite-related fatalities that occurred in the United States from 1979 through 1988. Of the 157 deaths, 70% occurred among children who were less than 10 years of age. The death rate for neonates was almost 370 times that of adults who were 30 to 49 years of age. Pit bull breeds were involved in 42 (41.6%) of 101 deaths where dog breed was reported, almost three times more than German shepherds, the next most commonly reported breed. The proportion of deaths attributable to pit bulls increased from 20% in 1979 and 1980 to 62% in 1987 and 1988. Pit bull attacks were almost twice as likely to be caused by strays as attacks by other breeds. Extrapolated estimates suggest 183 to 204 dog bite-related fatalities from 1979 through 1988. To prevent such deaths, we recommend stronger animal control laws, public education regarding dog bites, and more responsible dog ownership. Parents and physicians should be aware that infants left alone with a dog may be at risk of death.\r"
