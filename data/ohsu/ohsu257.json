  ".U": "88125825\r", 
  ".W": "Experience using ultrafast CT in the diagnostic evaluation of more than 50 infants and children indicates that this new technique is highly accurate and easily performed. Ultrafast CT offers several advantages compared to conventional CT. Scan times of either 0.05 or 0.1 seconds were sufficiently short to eliminate motion artifacts, even without patient sedation; sedation is a routine procedure for the conventional CT examination of most infants and small children and carries a finite risk. Procedure time appears to be shorter using ultrafast CT, 15 minutes or less, than with conventional CT. No control data using conventional CT are available for this patient population, but generally pediatric body CT studies are scheduled at hourly intervals at our medical center and are rarely completed in less than 30 minutes. Dynamic imaging alternatives for evaluation of the pediatric heart and airway include angiocardiography, digital subtraction studies, and fluoroscopy, which are limited by relatively high radiation exposure and by the inability to display all wall motions simultaneously due to their projectional rather than tomographic orientation. The potential for acquiring serial 0.05-second images of rapidly moving structures, including the heart, airway, and lungs, is unique to the ultrafast CT technique and facilitates the identification of functional abnormalities, including intracardiac shunts, valvular obstructions, tracheomalacia, and segmental bronchial obstruction. The relationships of mediastinal soft tissue structures and vessels are well defined by both ultrafast and conventional CT. In situations in which fine spatial resolution is pivotally important, the radiologist has the option with the C-100 scanner to select the 0.1-second scanning mode. This mode results in a higher radiation exposure per slice, approximately two-fold, and also uses an array of more closely spaced detectors, 864, to increase dose efficiency and spatial resolution. Although not generally required for our pediatric patients, one has the additional option of performing repeated 0.1-second images at any level, as many as ten exposures, totaling 1.0 seconds, to increase photon flux and increase resolution. Thus, the choice of scanning options can markedly influence both radiation dose, resolution, and contrast sensitivity characteristics.\r"

MR images were analyzed for (a) location and size of the primary tumor; (b) tumor extension to the uterine corpus, vagina, parametria, pelvic sidewall, bladder, or rectum; and (c) pelvic lymphadenopathy. The accuracy of MR imaging in determination of tumor location was 91% and for determination of tumor size within 0.5 cm, 70%. Its accuracy was 93% for vaginal extension and 88% for parametrial extension. Pelvic sidewall, bladder, and rectal involvement were accurately excluded in all patients, but the positive predictive values were 75%, 67%, and 100%, respectively. Overall, the accuracy of MR imaging in staging was 81%. MR imaging is valuable because it can accurately demonstrate tumor location, tumor size, degree of stromal penetration, and lower uterine segment involvement. It is also valuable for ruling out parametrial, pelvic sidewall, bladder, and rectal involvement.\r"

Overall, MR imaging demonstrated 101 of 106 lesions (95%), including all 93 tumors that were larger than 3 cm in diameter but only eight of the 13 smaller tumors (62%). MR imaging enabled accurate staging of 82% of all detected lesions but led to the understaging of nine lesions and the overstaging of nine. At present, MR imaging cannot be used as a screening modality for renal tumors. However, its negative predictive values of 98% and 99%, respectively, for the evaluation of tumor vascular extension and tumor spread to adjacent structures makes it an excellent staging modality that should be used when the CT findings are equivocal. MR imaging is not accurate in indicating bowel and mesentery involvement, but rapid technical advances and the introduction of bowel contrast medium may improve this present limitation.\r"

The sensitivity at a specificity level of 90% was determined for each reviewer (100%, 96%, and 83%, respectively).

The stainless-steel GF was evaluated in vitro for its propensity to perforate canine inferior venae cavae (IVC). Magnetic force and torque at 1.5 T did not dislodge the GF or result in perforation of canine IVC by the GF. Beta-3 titanium alloy (used in a new percutaneous version of the GF) is apparently one of the best-suited metals for use with MR imaging because of its lack of ferromagnetism (up to 4.7 T) and absence of MR imaging artifacts (at 0.35 T). Devices composed of Elgiloy (Mobin-Uddin filter), nitinol, and MP32-N (Amplatz filter) alloys all created mild artifacts. Devices fashioned from 304 and 316L (GF and Palmaz stent) stainless-steel alloys created severe \"black-hole\" artifacts, with the 304 alloy devices also showing marked image distortion. Generally, the greater the ferromagnetism of a device, the greater its magnetic susceptibility artifact.\r"

Three stones completely dissolved within 30 minutes, seven were reduced in size, and three were visibly unaffected. All stones not completely dissolved were easily extracted by means of a stone basket except for one in a patient taken to surgery. Although MTBE perfusion is an effective technique for management of biliary calculi, practitioners should be aware that its use is quite time consuming and its odor difficult to control.\r"

The postembolization syndrome (fever, elevated white blood cell count, and discomfort) was encountered after 42.7% of the procedures, and in 43.7%, no significant adverse reactions were documented. The major complications and deaths were encountered in patients with a serious underlying abnormality in whom no alternative form of treatment was available and who were extremely sick prior to the procedure. When considered in relationship to the natural progress of the disease and the lack of other treatment options, the overall complication rate seems acceptable.\r"

The occluded portions were canalized by advancing a ceramic-capped delivery system and delivering intermittent laser emissions. The canal was widened by simultaneous inflation of three or four Gruentzig balloon catheters. In two of the three cases, this procedure was done after unsuccessful canalization of the occluded portions by conventional means. Postoperatively, all patients showed disappearance of Budd-Chiari syndrome. One patient also showed marked regression of a huge intraluminal thrombus. There were no serious complications during and after the procedures. Use of the Nd-YAG laser seems to be of value in PTA for the treatment of hepatic IVC obstructions as well as in treatment of arteriosclerotic lesions.\r"

In patients with dysrhaphism, most abnormalities, including hydromyelia, inclusion tumors, and sites of cord tether, were demonstrated with MR imaging. Diastematomyelia and small hydromyelic cavities were indistinguishable on routine coronal and sagittal T1-weighted images; axial images with T2 weighting were optimal for this differentiation. MR imaging did not enable direct visualization of a thickened filum or evaluation of tethering with a thin, dorsally positioned neural placode. Congenital or severe scoliosis required lengthy studies with multiple planes of imaging or myelography and CT. Milder curvatures were readily evaluated with MR imaging, and neoplastic lesions, with the exception of intrathecal tumor seeding, were adequately defined.\r"

The T1 relaxivity of Gd-DOTA (meglumine salt) determined in saline and in liver tissue at 20 MHz was similar to the relaxivity of Gd-DTPA. Tissue proton relaxation enhancement (PRE) correlated closely with chemical measurement of tissue gadolinium concentration. In rats, the biodistribution of Gd-DOTA was similar to Gd-DTPA with a distribution half-life of 3 minutes and an elimination half-life of 18 minutes. The median lethal dose (LD50) in mice of Gd-DOTA was 93% higher than that of Gd-DTPA; the calculated safety factor (ratio of LD50 to effective dose) was 53 for Gd-DOTA and 28 for Gd-DTPA.

The authors performed a prospective study to reevaluate this concept and to clarify the nature of the pathologic findings underlying the observed radiographic changes. Specimens were examined for 50 consecutive patients undergoing resection of pulmonary carcinoma. Histologic changes interpreted as noninfectious were found in 42 cases. Findings suggestive of recent or remote infection were also present in nine of these 42 specimens and were localized predominantly in relation to small- to medium-sized airways (acute bronchitis or bronchiolitis); these changes were always present in a background of noninfectious pneumonitis. The authors conclude that the radiographic changes seen in airway obstruction in surgically excised lungs are usually due to consolidation of lung parenchyma by a noninfectious process. When infection does occur, it involves primarily the airways and is not likely to be radiographically detectable.\r"

Certain characteristic findings on CT scans were evident: uneven thickening of bronchovascular bundles, thickening of isolated interstitial lines, and the presence of polygonal lines. These findings may be seen on CT scans even if the findings on chest radiographs are normal or nonspecific. The pathologic basis for these characteristic CT findings may relate to tumor thrombi in lymphatic vessels rather than edema and fibrosis, at least in the early stages of disease.\r"

Thin-section HRCT scans were obtained at five discrete levels through the mid and lower thorax in both prone and supine positions. The same technique was used in 34 age-similar control patients. Parenchymal abnormalities were seen most frequently in the posterior portion of the lung bases in the asbestos-exposed subjects. HRCT prone scans enabled basal structural abnormalities to be reliably distinguished from gravity-related physiologic phenomena in 25 asbestos-exposed subjects. HRCT was more sensitive than CT in detection of both pleural and parenchymal fibrosis. In subjects with clinical asbestosis, HRCT demonstrated parenchymal abnormality in 96%, compared with 83% for CT. Similarly, pleural thickening was shown in 100% of subjects at HRCT, compared with 93% at CT. HRCT could be an important adjunct in the evaluation of asbestos-related pleuroparenchymal fibrosis. An HRCT study including prone scans is a sensitive, reliable means of detecting thoracic abnormalities in asbestos-exposed individuals.\r"

For four common, relatively new mammographic units, phototimed density decreases markedly as breast thickness increases. This trend is attributed to three factors: beam hardening, film reciprocity law failure (RFL), and photosensor dark or leakage current. The contributions of these three factors were experimentally quantitated for the phototimer of a Senographe 500T mammography unit. For a phototimed 28-kVp nongrid technique, the density varied from 2.0 for a 2.5-cm-thick phantom to 0.3 for one 7.6 cm thick. Of the 1.7 difference in film density, 1.1 was attributed to beam hardening, 0.2 to RFL, and 0.4 to photomultiplier tube dark current. A circuit modification was installed in the phototimer that offsets the photomultiplier dark current and has a nonlinear response to compensate for beam hardening and RFL effects. The modified phototimer tracked to within +/- 0.06 density for a 28-kVp grid technique as phantom thickness was varied from 2.0 to 6.0 cm. Similar results were obtained for nongrid techniques.\r"

Six other patients had transversely oriented fractures that extended through the carotid canal and petrous temporal bone. While less frequently contributing directly to mortality, transverse fractures were also associated with cerebrospinal fluid leaks (two patients) and a cavernous sinus-carotid fistula (one patient). They were not as frequently associated with Horner syndrome or cranial nerve deficits as suggested in the current literature. This retrospective evaluation reveals two distinct injury patterns that demonstrate a difference in related morbidity and mortality.\r"

Reliable criteria for pyogenic infection were complete prevertebral soft-tissue involvement, diffuse osteolytic destruction, gas within both bone and soft tissue, and a process centering on an intervertebral disk. Neoplastic disease was characterized by posterior element involvement, partial or absent prevertebral soft-tissue swelling, and osteoblastic alterations. In a limited number of cases, nonpyogenic infection was characterized by focal lytic bone involvement and marginal sclerosis. Blinded testing of these criteria indicated potential for improved diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice.\r"

Anterior migration was evident in 14 of the 19 hips with a superior migration pattern, whereas posterior migration was present in five of the seven hips with a medial migration pattern. In the remainder of cases, no migration in the transverse plane was present. Femoral anteversion as determined with CT, femoral neck-shaft angle, angle of acetabular inclination, and acetabular anteversion angle in this relatively small sample were all found to be within normal limits and appeared to have no influence on the occurrence of a specific pattern of femoral head migration.\r"

Three MR criteria were applied: irregularity or a wavy contour of the anterior margin of the ligament, high-signal-intensity change within the substance of the ligament on T2-weighted images, and discontinuity of that substance. The sagittal T2-weighted image was especially helpful, producing an \"arthrographic\" effect, in which the anterior margin of the ACL is outlined by high-signal-intensity joint fluid. By demonstrating ACL and other extrameniscal lesions, MR imaging may help clarify the mechanisms of knee injury.\r"

All arthroscopically visible ligamentous injuries, including partial cruciate tears, were detected with MR imaging. There was excellent correlation for high-grade cartilaginous lesions, although MR imaging appeared insensitive to small cartilage irregularities. Additionally, MR imaging allowed diagnosis of ten bone abnormalities not accessible to arthroscopic evaluation. The high accuracy of MR imaging that was found in this study was in large part due to the thin, contiguous sections generated in volume imaging. With the added advantage of high patient throughput, fast volume MR imaging is an accurate and efficient method for evaluation of knee abnormality.\r"

Recent developments in sequence design have allowed images of moving spins to be obtained without a loss of signal by rephasing the spins with three or four gradient pulses to compensate for constant velocity or acceleration, respectively. At longer echo times (TE), this approach allowed for low readout gradients and high signal-to-noise ratios. Angiograms with a resolution of 300 micron were obtained. With additional sequences that allow some dephasing but minimal signal loss, separate images of arteries and veins were obtained. Phase information was used to estimate flow velocity. Application of the rephasing scheme to gradient-echo sequences allowed for ungated, fast MR angiograms. Acceleration correction was important for long TE sequences, but velocity-corrected, gradient-echo sequences with a very short TE were comparable to velocity- and acceleration-corrected, gradient-echo sequences with slightly longer TEs. With ungated three-dimensional, gradient-echo sequences, susceptibility artifacts were minimized and excellent contrast-to-noise ratios were obtained.\r"

By angling the sections slightly from the coronal plane and rotating the subject, simultaneous sections can be obtained within the given repetition time through both regions without a loss of the signal-to-noise ratio that would result from the use of true coronal sections. The technique has allowed simultaneous imaging of both shoulders and, with rotation of the subject, both knees.\r"

The algorithm, which resembles a new lightness algorithm recently proposed by Land, is approximately equivalent to filtering the image through a center-surround receptive field in individual chromatic channels. The synthesizing technique, optimal linear estimation, requires only one assumption, that the operator that transforms input into output is linear. This assumption is true for a certain class of early vision algorithms that may therefore be synthesized in a similar way from examples. Other methods of synthesizing algorithms from examples, or \"learning,\" such as back-propagation, do not yield a significantly better lightness algorithm.\r"

GAWTS bypasses cloning and increases the rate of sequence acquisition by at least fivefold. The method involves the attachment of a phage promoter onto at least one of the PCR primers. The segments amplified by PCR are transcribed to further increase the signal and to provide an abundance of single-stranded template for reverse transcriptase-mediated dideoxy sequencing. An end-labeled reverse transcriptase primer complementary to the desired sequence generates the additional specificity required to generate unambiguous sequence data. GAWTS can be performed on as little as a nanogram of genomic DNA. The rate of GAWTS can be increased by coamplification and cotranscription of multiple regions as illustrated by two regions of the factor IX gene. Since GAWTS lends itself well to automation, further increases in the rate of sequence acquisition can be expected.\r"

These include the biological basis and social complexity of the behaviors that must be changed, disagreement about the propriety of educational messages to prevent AIDS, uncertainty about the degree of risk to the majority of Americans, and dual messages of reassurance and alarm from responsible officials. Long-term protection of an individual from infection requires extreme changes in risk-taking behavior. Partial shifts toward safer practices may be epidemiologically important in retarding the rate and extent of spread of infection. Though some striking changes in behavior have occurred, especially in homosexual populations in areas with high prevalence of AIDS, educational efforts to date have succeeded more in raising awareness and knowledge about AIDS than in producing sufficient changes in behavior. The United States has yet to mount a nationwide comprehensive, intensive, and targeted education program to prevent AIDS.\r"

This question pertains to three spheres of public policy in the United States: public health, the delivery of health care, and research. In the public health sphere, vigorous educational efforts will be required, as will modified approaches to intravenous drug use, prostitution, and homosexual and bisexual sexual activity. Carefully targeted, voluntary testing and screening programs should be coupled with counseling and with guarantees of confidentiality and nondiscrimination where these are appropriate. Both health care workers and the health care system have a moral obligation to provide care to people with HIV infection, but heroic self-sacrifice should not be required provided that infection control precautions are observed. Patients with neurological involvement and terminally ill patients will benefit from statutes allowing recognition of advance directives about preferred modes of care or nontreatment. There is a moral imperative to perform intensive research directed toward the understanding, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and AIDS. The research process will raise challenging ethical questions.\r"

Black and Hispanic adults and children have reported rates 3 to 12 times as high as whites. This can be largely attributed to higher reported rates in black and Hispanic intravenous (IV) drug abusers, their sex partners, and infants. In 1986, reported AIDS deaths increased adult male and female mortality in the United States by an estimated 0.7 and 0.07%, respectively, with much greater increases in selected age groups or areas of the country. The greatest variation in infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (0 to 70%) has been found in surveys of IV drug abusers, while surveys of homosexual men reveal infection rates of 20 to 50%. Infection with HIV ranged from 0 to 2.6% in limited sexually transmitted disease clinic surveys of heterosexual men and women without a history of IV drug abuse or known sexual contact with persons at increased risk. The modes of HIV transmission are now well understood, but a large amount of biologic variability in efficiency of transmission remains to be explained. The period between initial infection with HIV and the development of AIDS is variable, but the risk for disease progression increases with duration of infection.\r"

These cells receive synapses from AVM but do not participate in the touch reflex circuit.

The G-PI anchor was found to be heterogeneous with respect to monosaccharide sequence, and several novel glycosidic linkages were present. The results are pertinent to the mechanism of the biosynthesis of G-PI anchors.\r"

  ".U": "88127135\r", 
  ".W": "In rats, an environmental manipulation occurring early in life resulted in changes in the adrenocortical axis that persisted throughout the entire life of the animals and attenuated certain deficits associated with aging. Rats handled during infancy had a permanent increase in concentrations of receptors for glucocorticoids in the hippocampus, a critical region in the negative-feedback inhibition of adrenocortical activity. Increased receptor concentrations led to greater hippocampal sensitivity to glucocorticoids and enhanced negative-feedback efficacy in the handled rats. Thus, at all ages tested, rats that were not handled secreted more glucocorticoids in response to stress than did handled rats. At later ages, nonhandled rats also showed elevated basal glucocorticoid levels, with the result that there was a greater cumulative exposure to glucocorticoids in nonhandled rats. Increased exposure to adrenal glucocorticoids can accelerate hippocampal neuron loss and cognitive impairments in aging. Hippocampal cell loss and pronounced spatial memory deficits emerged with age in the nonhandled rats, but were almost absent in the handled rats. Previous work showed that glucocorticoid hypersecretion, hippocampal neuron death, and cognitive impairments form a complex degenerative cascade of aging in the rat. The present study shows that a subtle manipulation early in life can retard the emergence of this cascade.\r"

In contrast, ICa elevated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent phosphorylation decreases by more than 50 percent. The effect of [Mg2+]i is not due to changes in the concentration of cAMP or in the velocity of phosphorylation but rather appears to be a direct effect on the phosphorylated channel or on channel dephosphorylation.\r"

The skeleton shows many embryonic features and may well be the smallest fossil reptile known (body length 51 millimeters). It reached only 22% of mean adult length whereas modern reptiles of this size do not hatch before they reach about 30% of mean adult length.

Computerized tomography (CT) allows simpler patient positioning, more reliable detection of subtle fractures, better characterization of complex fractures, and detection of associated soft tissue and joint space abnormalities. The addition of multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) provides a better understanding of the pathoanatomy. The sacrum and the sacroiliac joint, traditionally problematic to image, are particularly well defined by CT/MPR. Subtle diastasis and intra-articular fragments are more reliably detected when the transaxial image is supplemented by coronal reconstructions. The degree of comminution and direction of fragment displacement are also best defined by coronal and sagittal formatting. Surgeons often find this protocol useful in preoperative assessment of extent and stability of fractures, and in planning conservative or surgical management.\r"

A microcomputer was used for the storage and manipulation of data based upon 1972 Academy criteria. Control of vertigo was accomplished in 83% of patients; 51% of patients were graded class A or B, according to the 1972 Academy criteria. No serious complications occurred. Problems included the potential for serious complications, the lack of specific criteria for patient selection, and the continued deterioration of hearing with the passage of time. Comparison of data with those presented in 1973 indicates a lower overall success rate, but continued success in the management of vertigo and imbalance. The endolymphatic sac subarachnoid shunt is worthy of consideration in the management of Meniere's disease when surgery is indicated and retention of hearing is desirable.\r"

The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to compare the PIH profile scores of patients demonstrating mild PIH without proteinuria with those of patients demonstrating mild PIH with proteinuria, and (2) to introduce the PIH profile graph as a standardized clinical assessment tool. Serial PIH profile data after 24 weeks' gestation from 46 term primigravid patients with mild PIH (group 1 = 19 patients without proteinuria; group 2 = 27 patients with proteinuria) were plotted on PIH profile graphs and compared. Profile scores from ten normotensive primigravidas at term served as controls. Serial profile scores for groups 1 and 2 showed similar patterns on the profile graph. Based on these data, we believe that PIH without proteinuria is clinically and biochemically a manifestation of true preeclampsia before the onset of proteinuria. Furthermore, the PIH profile graph allows one to identify subtle changes in the disorder and to anticipate the development of severe preeclampsia.\r"

Histochemical demonstration of prostate-specific antigen has a higher sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma than does prostatic acid phosphatase. Similarly, measurement of prostate-specific antigen by immunoassay in serum is a more sensitive indicator of tumor stage and recurrence after therapy than prostatic acid phosphatase. More information is needed, however, regarding the variation in this protein with different therapeutic methods.\r"

The experience with 19 leaks that occurred after 791 gastric bariatric operations performed at North Carolina Memorial Hospital from 1975 to 1986 is described. The incidence of leaks was higher (8.3%) after a second than after a first gastric bariatric operation (2.0%). Ten leaks were life threatening and nine were not. There were no deaths. The diagnosis was made on the basis of Gastrografin swallow in seven patients, clinical findings in six, oral dye studies in three, barium study, a sinogram, and operation in one patient each. Thirteen of 16 patients were operated on within 4 hours of the diagnosis of a leak. One patient with a life-threatening leak and two with non-life-threatening leaks were managed without operations. Three patients were discharged after uncomplicated courses and readmitted, and the diagnosis of a leak was established. To minimize morbidity and mortality related to a leak, it is imperative to (1) recognize that a leak can occur after any gastric bariatric operation, (2) perform a Gastrografin swallow when a leak is suspected, and (3) operate on the patient if the Gastrografin swallow is positive or if the clinical findings suggest a leak.\r"

After a mean follow-up of 84 months and 99 months, respectively, survival of the irradiated patients was significantly better than that of controls (68% versus 52%, p less than 0.05). Disease-free survival of those patients rendered free of disease by treatment was also superior for the irradiated group (84% versus 57%, p less than 0.005). Local recurrence without signs of distant metastases developed only one-third as often in irradiated patients (6% versus 18%). Distant metastases, alone or in combination with local recurrence, were also less common after radiation (12% versus 27%). Second primary tumors developed in 15% and 10% of the respective groups, a difference that was not statistically significant. When we consider the survival benefit of preoperative radiation therapy, long-term complications were relatively mild. Delayed healing of the perineum was noted in two irradiated patients. Persistent diarrhea was severe enough to warrant treatment in only one case, and one patient required a colostomy for intestinal obstruction from pelvic fibrosis.\r"

Epithelial hyperplasia accompanied by round cell infiltration and increased thickness of the wall with fibrosis was observed histologically in the resected bile ducts of all 40 patients. Twenty-two of 26 patients (86.4%) who had bouts of abdominal pain showed that epithelial hyperplasia with round cell infiltration is dominant (glandular type), and 11 of 15 cases (73.7%) with persistent jaundice showed that thickness of the wall with fibrosis is dominant (fibrotic type). Amylase activities in bile of glandular-type cases obtained from the common bile duct intraoperatively were significantly greater than those of fibrotic-type cases (p less than 0.01). The common bile ducts of the canine model, in which whole pancreatic juice passed in the bile duct, dilated cylindrically 3.28 +/- 2.48 times in diameter after 24 to 41 days and histologically showed epithelial hyperplasia with round cell infiltration of the glandular type. These findings suggest that an anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system and the reflux of pancreatic juice into the bile duct affect not only clinical manifestations but also pathologic changes, especially of the glandular type, in patients with congenital dilatation of the bile duct.\r"

A total of 590 aspirates with subsequent follow-up were documented. One hundred thirty-three primary cancers were histologically proved. Of the 133 cancers, 91 (68%) were diagnosed as malignant by aspiration cytologic examination; another 22 (17%) were reported as suspicious. Of the cancers, 8 (6%) had a benign cytologic diagnosis and 12 (9%) had unsatisfactory smears. No cytologic tests positive for malignancy were found to be benign on histologic examination. With an absolute sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 100%, we conclude that FNA cytologic examination is highly accurate in the diagnosis of breast cancer. With no false-positive studies, the finding of a clearly malignant cytologic condition obviates the need for biopsy before mastectomy.\r"

This study was performed to assess the effects of changes in limb position, oxygen inhalation, and arterial reconstruction on TcPO2 values in patients with peripheral vascular disease. In addition, a TcPO2 index (foot TcPO2/chest TcPO2) was compared with the Doppler-derived ankle-to-brachial index (ABI) to determine which was the more effective monitor of the response to revascularization. Foot TcPO2 values of 22 patients with claudication or rest pain were measured before and after vascular reconstruction. TcPO2 increased after revascularization in both groups regardless of limb position or oxygen (O2) administration. The dependent position and O2 inhalation had an additive effect on TcPO2. Preoperative TcPO2 values in patients with rest pain showed the greatest response to the dependent position, increasing from 14 mm Hg to 33 mm Hg at room air and from 21 mm Hg to 53 mm Hg with O2 inhalation. TcPO2 in both patient groups was remarkably enhanced by O2 administration after revascularization. Postoperative supine TcPO2 values measured at room air increased from 50 mm Hg to 124 mm Hg (148%) in patients with claudication and from 40 mm Hg to 109 mm Hg (173%) in patients with rest pain after O2 inhalation. Comparison of the TcPO2 index with the ABI showed that absolute and normalized TcPO2 values are equally effective in monitoring peripheral arterial insufficiency. This study suggests that placing the limb in the dependent position and administering O2 may augment TcPO2 to levels where symptoms may resolve. The response of TcPO2 to O2 inhalation may be an indicator that reflects the response to revascularization.\r"

Aspirin (250 mg/day) and dipyridamole (75 mg/twice daily) were given throughout the study as antiplatelet therapy. Animals were killed 2 and 5 weeks after surgery. Patency rates for seeded grafts in dogs were 75% (6:8) and 83% (10:12) at 2 and 5 weeks, respectively. In control grafts the patency rates were identical. Patency rates for seeded grafts in sheep were 0% (0:5) and 11% (1:9) at 2 and 5 weeks, respectively. Control grafts in sheep had a patency rate of 40% (2:5) and 0% (0:9) at corresponding times. Scanning electron microscopy showed an almost complete endothelialization of seeded grafts in dogs after 5 weeks. Platelet deposition was studied in the dogs by means of chromium-51-labeled autologous platelets. Significantly fewer platelets accumulated on seeded grafts, and the ratio of 6-keto-PCF1 alpha to thromboxane B2 was significantly higher, compared with unseeded grafts, which indicated the presence of a functionally active endothelial lining in seeded grafts. Differences in the hemostatic system could account for the high clotting incidence in sheep, compared with that in dogs. Such species differences make extrapolations to the clinical situation from autologous endothelial seeding in experimental animals hazardous.\r"

Four seeded grafts as well as four nonseeded preclotted control grafts were histologically evaluated immediately after seeding and on preclotting; the other seeded grafts (n = 12) as well as nonseeded preclotted control grafts (n = 12) were implanted into the abdominal aorta of rats and were evaluated after 2 hours (n = 4), 2 days (n = 4), and 1 week (n = 4) with regard to the process of arterial wall regeneration. All grafts, except one seeded graft harvested at 1 week, were patent. All nonseeded control grafts showed no (at 2 hours and at 2 days) or limited (at 1 week) smooth muscle cell ingrowth. Of the 11 patent seeded grafts three also showed poor or limited neomedia development, probably because of improper preclotting. However, eight of the 11 patent seeded grafts showed fast and uniform noemedia development (clearly discernible at 2 days). Moreover, in two patent 1-week seeded grafts there were neomedia comparable in thickness and architecture (circularly arranged smooth muscle cells) to that of normal rat media, and a neointima had already lined 30% to 40% of the lumen. These results clearly demonstrate that smooth muscle cell seeding in biodegradable grafts is feasible and indicate that this seeding can enhance the process of arterial wall regeneration in these grafts.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated oral ingestion as the route of fluorescein administration for fluorescence assessment of skin perfusion. In 10 anesthetized rats, dorsal pedicle flaps were raised to produce graded perfusion; then fluorescein (7.5 mg/kg) was administered via an oropharyngeal tube. Quantification of skin fluorescence, performed with the fiberoptic fluorometer 45 minutes after dye ingestion, delineated a significant difference between the perfusion of flap regions that remained viable and those that subsequently became dystrophic (p less than 0.05). The precision was equivalent to that previously reported after intravenous dye. In addition, the gradual delivery of dye after oral administration permitted monitoring of slope of uptake and time to peak. Each of these pharmacokinetic parameters delineated a significant difference between viable and nonviable sections. As measures of relative change in fluorescence, they are independent of skin color and thickness. This feature suggests that the oral route actually may improve the accuracy and reliability of the fluorescein test.\r"

  ".W": "Reorganization of the arterial wall through natural processes on the resorption of a totally bioresorbable graft was investigated in dogs with Vicryl prostheses coated with two different blends of bioresorbable polyesters capable of slowing down considerably the disintegration of a Vicryl fabric in vivo. The prostheses (8 to 9 mm in internal diameter, 8 to 10 cm long) were implanted in the infrarenal aortic position for up to 24 weeks. All 18 animals implanted with coated prostheses survived, whereas one animal implanted with an uncoated Vicryl prosthesis died because of early rupture of the graft. Patent tubular conduits were present in 14 animals at the time of retrieval. On resorption of the synthetic polymers, the tissue layers that formed on both sides of the prosthetic material either fused or remained separated, depending on the polymer used as a retardant coating. We conclude that polymer composition influences the repair process and that a fully resorbable vascular graft can function effectively in a canine model, provided that tissue organization is sufficiently advanced by the time the prosthesis has lost its mechanical integrity. Further studies are needed to document the performance of the newly formed blood conduit over extended periods, in hypertensive subjects, and when presented with a bacterial challenge.\r"

The long-term incidence of stroke after bilateral carotid endarterectomy is also poorly documented. In this report the results of staged contralateral carotid endarterectomies performed by one surgeon in a consecutive series of 89 patients are analyzed. No deaths occurred after a first or contralateral carotid endarterectomy. Four (4%) neurologic deficits (three minor and one major) occurred after a first operation, whereas only one (1%) major neurologic deficit occurred after a contralateral carotid endarterectomy. Postendarterectomy hypertension was noted in 33 (37%) patients after a first operation, and in 62 (70%) patients after a contralateral carotid endarterectomy (p less than 0.00001). No correlation existed among the intervals between carotid operations and the incidence or duration of hypertension after a contralateral carotid endarterectomy. From our results we conclude that the staged contralateral carotid endarterectomy can be safely performed with a stroke-mortality rate approaching 1%. Postendarterectomy hypertension, although more frequent after the contralateral operation as compared with the first operation, has no correlation with the interval between procedures. After a staged bilateral carotid endarterectomy, only one (1%) patient experienced transient ischemic attack symptoms, but five (6%) patients suffered late stroke (four fatal).\r"

Confirmation of M. hominis infection requires awareness on the part of the clinician and assistance from an informed microbiologist.

Six (66.7%) of them were positive for anti-HD, a prevalence much higher than that in HBsAg carriers without hemophilia in Japan (1/113 or 0.9%, p less than 0.001). Anti-HIV was found in 96 (47.5%), in sharp contrast to the low prevalence (0/1205) in apparently healthy blood donors (p less than 0.001). These results implicated imported plasma products in the transmission of both delta and human immunodeficiency viruses to hemophiliacs.

The molarity of E-64 required to cause complete inhibition of papain activity is equal to the molarity of papain-active sites. Preparations of papain from various sources were assayed for protease activity by hydrolysis of azoalbumin using several variants of the basic technique and also by hydrolysis of azocasein. For each variant of azoprotein assay procedure, the active sites of the papain were measured using E-64. All variations of the azoprotein technique yielded similar estimates of the active site molarity of the papain preparations, whereas the azoprotein assay results alone showed wide variation. Quantitation of the active-site molarity of various papain preparations using E-64 correlated with serologic efficacy.\r"

Negative eluates traditionally have been suspected to be associated with drug reactions. This report confirms that the most frequent cause of a positive DAT and a nonreactive eluate is hypergammaglobulinemia. The results of 74 patient samples with positive DATs were analyzed retrospectively. Eluates prepared from the red cells of 54 patients (72.9%) reacted; eluates from 20 patients (27.1%) did not react. This latter group had identical serologic and clinical findings, suggesting that they made up a homogeneous group. In particular, the patients had a positive DAT, a negative indirect antiglobulin test, and a negative eluate; an increased serum concentration of IgG; and no evidence of hemolysis. In a subsequent study, DATs were performed prospectively on red cells from 44 consecutive patients with elevated serum IgG levels. The serum IgG concentration was highest in the three patients whose red cells had a positive DAT. The DAT also became positive in two patients treated with high-dose intravenous gammaglobulin (IV IgG). These studies indicate that a negative eluate from red cells with a positive DAT, a common serologic finding, is often caused by hypergammaglobulinemia. The authors postulate that IgG binds nonspecifically to the red cells because of the hypergammaglobulinemia.\r"

Four of the eight patients responded to the combined therapy with a mean peak platelet count of 132,000 per microliter (range, 74,000 to 225,000/microliter). Responses lasted approximately 2 weeks. These four patients were among the five who had initially responded to IVGG before becoming refractory; none of the three patients without an initial response to IVGG responded to the combined therapy. Age, duration of disease, and splenectomy status did not appear to be related to response to the combined therapy. Two patients began maintenance treatment (1 PE followed by 1 g/kg IVGG on the same day), but both became unresponsive after three treatments. PE combined with IVGG may be a useful treatment for some patients with refractory ITP who have uncontrollable bleeding or require major surgery. The development of resistance to IVGG effect may be mediated by an increase in the level of antiplatelet antibodies. PE, by lowering antiplatelet antibody levels, may then allow IVGG infusion to be effective again in elevating the platelet count.\r"

The reduction in WB availability was part of a planned statewide shift in blood procurement and processing from hospitals' individual blood banks to a new statewide blood center. Hospital WB use declined 96 percent, from 3400 to 109 units annually, with a net addition of more than 3000 units of plasma to the statewide stocks. A large increase in the use of other blood components occurred when WB was withdrawn, but this use fell sharply in 1984 and 1985, despite the continued relative unavailability of WB. Analysis of individual hospitals' services showed that increases in the use of packed red cells were distributed across all the services that frequently use red cell transfusions. However, a disproportionate rise and then fall in the use of fresh-frozen plasma and platelets for cardiovascular operations were observed. The data suggest that education and more conservative transfusion practices are reducing the use of blood components despite continued restricted availability of WB.\r"

Then they replaced the plasma with an equal volume of 3 percent Dextran 40-electrolyte solution. They administered no protein-containing solutions during or after the plasma exchanges. Despite marked hypoalbuminemia immediately after plasma exchange, the plasma colloid osmotic pressure level fell only slightly because of the high concentration of plasma low-molecular dextran. The hemostatic abnormalities were similar to those seen in patients whose plasma was replaced with albumin solution. The exchanges were tolerated well clinically and no serious complications occurred during or after exchange. The authors believe that the 3 percent Dextran 40-electrolyte solution can be used safely as the sole replacement fluid in intensive plasma exchange programs for patients with malignant paraproteinemia.\r"

Thirteen alloimmunized patients receiving 55 washed platelet concentrates demonstrated a mean 1- to 4-hour corrected count increment of 3.99 X 10(3) per microliter, compared to 3.02 X 10(3) per microliter for 77 unwashed platelet units given to the same patients. This study documents that platelet concentrates maintain viability and efficacy following a semiautomated saline wash method using the Cobe 2991 Blood Cell Processor, a technique that may be helpful for patients who require plasma-depleted platelet transfusions.\r"

  ".W": "In follow-up to previous studies showing that stimulators of adenylate cyclase inhibit the activation of platelets in platelet concentrates (PC), the posttransfusion recovery and survival of autologous platelets prepared and stored after the addition of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) to platelet-rich plasma at a concentration of 1.3 X 10(-8) M were investigated. Six normal subjects were studied on the two occasions, using PC stored with and without PGE1 and radiolabeling with 51Cr. The mean recovery of platelets prepared with PGE1 (35.2 +/- 8.1%) was significantly lower (p less than 0.013) than that of routinely prepared platelet concentrates (46.3 +/- 9.4%). The mean life-spans of platelets prepared with and without PGE1 were 7.1 +/- 0.4 and 6.2 +/- 1.0 days, respectively (p = NS). Despite its ability to inhibit the activation of platelets during concentration and storage, prostaglandin E1 appears to reduce posttransfusion recovery of platelets significantly in this experimental model and cannot be recommended at this time as an adjunct for PC preparation.\r"

More cases of babesiosis are being reported as the range of the vector expands in the United States. Blood donors from an endemic area were tested for antibody to Babesia microti during the summer. Only 3.7 percent of the 779 donors were seropositive, compared with 4.7 percent (p greater than 0.05) of donors from a nonendemic area. An epidemiologic survey of seropositive and matched seronegative controls demonstrated no significant differences that would assist in screening donors.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to investigate body iron stores in so-called remunerated blood donors as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of hemoglobin determination in detecting iron deficiency in two populations of blood donors. The authors studied 522 male donors who were divided into three groups: Group I, first-time volunteer donors with hemoglobin levels greater than or equal to 13 g per dl; Group II, remunerated donors with hemoglobin levels greater than or equal to 13 g per dl; and Group III, remunerated donors rejected because their hemoglobin levels were less than 13 g per dl. Iron stores were evaluated with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for plasma ferritin. In Group I, 4.5 percent were iron-deficient with a mean ferritin value of 55.3 ng per ml; in Group II, 59.7 percent were iron deficient with a mean ferritin level of 17.4 ng per ml, and in Group III, 82.5 percent were iron-deficient and the mean ferritin level was 8.4 ng per ml. The last values represent the highest percentage of iron deficiency and the lowest mean ferritin value thus far reported. In Group I, hemoglobin determination had a sensitivity of 95 percent in detecting iron deficiency, but in Group II had only 40 percent sensitivity. These results indicate that a more accurate and reliable test, such as a plasma or serum ferritin determination, may be necessary to detect iron deficiency in blood donors when they donate more than five times per year, particularly those who are remunerated.\r"

Less than 5 percent of the transfused cells could be detected 48 hours posttransfusion. Her clinical condition deteriorated and renal failure developed. The patient died of pulmonary embolism. Her serum contained a strong (4+) IgM agglutinin and a weakly reactive (microscopically positive) IgG antibody, with anti-EnaTS specificity. EnaFS and EnaTS antigens were severely depressed or absent from the patient's RBCs; the ficin-resistant Ena antigen (EnaFR) appeared to be present. Pretransfusion RBC sialic acid level was 53 +/- 2 percent of normal. The patient's RBC membranes were shown to contain sialoglycoproteins beta and delta by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with periodic acid Schiff's base staining, with weak staining of components in the regions corresponding to alpha, alpha 2 and alpha delta. The nature of these components was not identified, but their presence suggested that the patient's RBCs expressed a previously undescribed sialoglycoprotein alpha variant.\r"

Statistical analysis of the mean PAP levels at the four sampling times in both groups of patients demonstrated no evidence of circadian or diurnal rhythmic variation. Prostate cancer patients did show significantly greater variability in daily PAP than patients without prostatic disease, although a distinct pattern of secretion was not observed in either group. These results underscore the potential inaccuracy of the use of single determination of serum PAP as a parameter of response in patients with metastatic prostatic cancer and in the staging of patients with clinically localized prostatic malignancy. Evaluation of trends of PAP levels over time, however, continues to play a major role in the assessment and management of patients with prostatic carcinoma.\r"

At the time of the repeat study, 35 patients (90%) had recurrent angina or myocardial infarction, and 4 patients (10%) were asymptomatic. Restenosis, defined as greater than 50% loss of PTCA gained diameter, was found in 19 patients (49%). In addition, 20 patients had new lesions or marked progression of existing lesions (defined as greater than 20% or increasing greater than 20% obstruction in coronary diameter) in the previously normal or mildly diseased coronary segments. The new or progressive lesions occurred both in patients with restenosis at the PTCA site (nine of 19) and in patients without restenosis (11 of 20). New or progressive lesions tended to occur more commonly in the artery on which PTCA was performed (13 of 40) than in the artery that did not have PTCA (10 of 77) (p less than 0.02 by chi 2). In arteries that had PTCA, new or progressive lesions occurred more often in the segment proximal to the angioplasty site (seven of 13 or 54%) than in the peri-PTCA segment (two of 13 or 15%) and in the segments distal to it (four of 13 or 31%), but this observation did not reach statistical significance. No other clinical, angiographic, or PTCA procedure variables affected the occurrence of new or progressive lesions. In patients with recurrent angina or myocardial infarction after PTCA, both restenosis and new or progressive lesions are common. New lesions or marked progression of existing lesions tended to occur in the vessel subjected to PTCA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Before PTCA, filling fraction was significantly less in patients with coronary artery disease than in the control group, although there was no significant difference in ejection fraction. Filling fraction improved significantly after PTCA. Regional filling fraction increased significantly in jeopardizing myocardium, but regional filling fraction in nonjeopardized myocardium did not change significantly. Ejection fraction and regional ejection fraction did not change significantly after PTCA. Our results indicate that the improvement of regional diastolic performance in jeopardized myocardium may contribute to the improvement of global diastolic performance after successful PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "A homogeneous group of six patients, who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery, was studied to determine the presence of oxidative stress caused by oxygen-derived free radicals and its relationship with reperfusion cell damage. Biopsies were performed before ischemia and 10 minutes after reperfusion. The samples were assayed for hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence and histochemical succinic dehydrogenase activity; the specimens were also studied by electron microscopy. The preischemic biopsy specimens showed chemiluminescence of 40 +/- 2 (cpm/mg protein) x 10(3), normal succinic dehydrogenase activity (grade 4), and generally preserved ultrastructure (necrotic/normal cells 5/100). However, the reperfusion biopsy specimens showed an increase in chemiluminescence to 91 +/- 19 (cpm/mg protein) x 10(3) (p less than 0.025), a partial loss of enzymatic activity (grade 2.6), and ultrastructural changes characterized by mitochondrial swelling and focal myofibrillar disorganization (necrotic/normal cells: 15/100; p less than 0.001). These observations seem to indicate the presence of oxidative stress during reoxygenation, a situation that may play a major role in the genesis of reperfusion injury. It appears to be the first observation relating free radical-induced oxidative stress to reperfusion injury in humans.\r"

The effects of transluminal angioplasty (TA) on experimental occlusive canine arterial thrombi that closely simulated the clinical condition was examined by a fiberoptic method. Experimental arterial thrombosis was produced by endothelial denudation and induction of luminal stenosis. Eighteen dogs that showed total occlusion of the iliac artery with thrombi were evaluated. Seven dogs (group A) with 6-hour-old thrombi received 20,000 IU/kg intravenous urokinase (UK) but did not show recanalization. TA was performed with a Gruentzig or Simpson-Robert balloon catheter and its effect was evaluated by a vascular fibroscope. Eight dogs (group B) with 6-hour-old thrombi underwent primary TA. After TA, less than 50% luminal obstruction with residual thrombi was visualized in five dogs (71%) of group A and four dogs (50%) of group B. Residual thrombi showed a doughnut-like or globular type shape and consisted of dense fibrin networks and compact platelet aggregates. All dogs in group B received 20,000 IU/kg intravenous UK after TA, but most of them showed progression of thrombus size despite UK infusion. In conclusion, the results suggest (1) that TA is effective in recanalization of an occluded artery with aged thrombus that is resistant to thrombolytic therapy and (2) that vascular fiberscope is a useful method for evaluation of the effects of TA on occlusive arterial thrombus.\r"

  ".U": "88130612\r", 
  ".W": "Although fluoroscopically detected coronary artery calcification is known to correlate with the presence of coronary artery stenosis, age, sex, and extent of calcification influence the strength of this association. To clarify its diagnostic potential, we performed fluoroscopy before coronary angiography in 600 patients and analyzed the results according to all three factors simultaneously. The sensitivity of fluoroscopy for significant stenosis exceeded 65% in all groups except women less than 45 years of age. Specificity exceeded 90% in patients less than 45 years and 85% in patients less than 55 years of age, and declined significantly with age. The number of vessels calcified was an important determinant of predictive value, except in those less than 45 years of age in whom even a single mild calcification markedly increased the chance of stenosis. In patients aged 45 to 64 years, calcification of two or three vessels substantially increased the chances of stenosis, but single-vessel calcification increased the risk only slightly. In patients more than 65 years of age, fluoroscopy was not helpful in detecting stenosis, regardless of the number of vessels calcified. Our findings were similar in men and women. We conclude that if both age and the number of vessels calcified are considered, fluoroscopy can provide useful information regarding the presence of stenosis in young and middle-aged patients.\r"

VFT in milliamperes (VFTmA) increased linearily with CS pressure (CSP) increases up to 41.2 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (VFTmA = 6.5 + 0.14 CSP mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Total coronary venous effluent (CBF) did not change significantly, suggesting compensatory coronary vasodilation. Myocardial O2 consumption also remained unchanged. At higher CSP, both CBF and VFT declined precipitously (VFTmA = 20.9 - 0.27 CSP mm Hg, p less than 0.02). With simultaneous increases of systemic arterial along with CSP, VFT increased again along with the CSP-induced reduction of gradient until it reached 42.8 +/- 3.2 mm Hg. We conclude that with coronary venous obstruction, despite coronary perfusion gradient reduction to about 40 mm Hg, CBF remains constant. This constant flow vasodilation is associated with substantial (82%) VFT increase. The mechanism may involve enhanced homogeneity of CBF distribution and increased extracellular fluid.\r"

However, compared to the placebo treatment, there was a significant (p less than 0.001) 66% reduction in the relative fraction of early-cycle ventricular premature complexes 7 to 9 days after initiation of timolol therapy and a more prolonged significant (p less than 0.001) 73% reduction in the fraction of early-cycle supraventricular complexes throughout the 28-day timolol and placebo comparison period. The frequency distribution of QRS duration was significantly different between the placebo- and timolol-treated patients, with the mean duration 8 msec longer in the placebo-treated patients (p = 0.008). Adverse effects from early administration of timolol did not differ from those in the placebo-treated patients.\r"

  ".W": "During acute superfusion studies by means of the standard microelectrode technique, we previously showed that both amiodarone and its major metabolite, desethylamiodarone, had a modest effect on the lengthening of the action potential duration (APD) at high drug concentrations and produced a rate-dependent block of the sodium channel in cardiac muscle. In this study the comparative electrophysiologic effects of the two compounds in rabbits treated chronically with these compounds were determined with particular reference to repolarization and sinus node automaticity. The changes were correlated with those in serum and tissue drug levels and in thyroid hormone indices. After 1 week neither compound had a significant effect on atrial or sinus nodal potentials; after 3 weeks, amiodarone increased the atrial APD at 90% repolarization time by 10.5% (p less than 0.05) and the effective refractory period (ERP) by 6.7% (p less than 0.05). The corresponding figures for desethylamiodarone were 13% (NS) and 18% (NS). The sinus cycle length was increased 12% (NS) by amiodarone and 27.9% (p less than 0.05) after the metabolite. In animals treated for 6 weeks, amiodarone increased the ventricular APD at 90% repolarization by 58.8% (p less than 0.01) and desethylamiodarone by 42.0% the corresponding figures for the ERP were 63.4% (p less than 0.01 and 47.4% (p less than 0.01), respectively. At the stimulation frequency used, neither compound exerted a significant effect on Vmax. Both amiodarone and desethylamiodarone significantly decreased serum triiodothyronine and increased reverse triiodothyronine levels but had no effect on thyroxine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Electrically-inducible ventricular tachycardia was suppressed by mexiletine alone in 23% of patients tested, and a combined antiarrhythmic drug regimen was effective in 29% of the trials performed. Mexiletine was much more likely to be effective in patients presenting with nonsustained VT or ventricular fibrillation than in patients with sustained VT (p less than 0.005). After 1 and 4 years of treatment, 18% and 42% of the patients treated with mexiletine alone had died suddenly or suffered recurrent symptomatic VT, compared to 11% and 25% of patients treated with the combined antiarrhythmic drug regimens (p = NS). Mexiletine therapy was associated with frequent, though readily reversible, adverse reactions. However, mexiletine treatment had to be discontinued permanently in 8 of 92 patients (9%) because of intolerable side effects. We conclude that the added efficacy and possible improved arrhythmia-free survival associated with combining mexiletine with a class Ia agent should be further investigated.\r"

  ".W": "Parenteral magnesium has been used for several decades in the empiric treatment of various arrhythmias, but the data on its electrophysiologic effects in man are limited. We evaluated the electrophysiologic effects of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) administration in eight normomagnesemic patients with normal mononuclear cell magnesium content, who had no clinically significant heart disease and had normal baseline electrophysiologic properties. After administration of intravenous MgSO4, serum magnesium rose significantly from 1.9 +/- 0.1 to 4.4 +/- 1.7 mg/dl (p less than 0.02). During a maintenance magnesium infusion, we observed significant prolongation of the ECG PR interval (145 +/- 18 to 155 +/- 26 msec, p less than 0.05), AH interval (77 +/- 27 to 83 +/- 26 msec, p less than 0.002), antegrade atrioventricular (AV) nodal effective refractory period (278 +/- 67 to 293 +/- 67 msec, p less than 0.05), and sinoatrial conduction time (60 +/- 34 to 76 +/- 32 msec, p less than 0.02). No significant effect was observed on sinus cycle length, sinus node recovery time, intra-atrial or intraventricular conduction times, QRS duration (during both sinus rhythm and ventricular pacing), QT interval, HV interval, paced cycle length resulting in AV nodal Wenckebach block, AV nodal functional refractory period, retrograde ventriculoatrial (VA) effective refractory period, or atrial and ventricular refractory periods. These findings, in conjunction with the demonstrated ability of magnesium to block slow channels for sodium movement, may provide an explanation of the mechanism by which magnesium exerts its effect in the treatment of atrial and junctional arrhythmias.\r"

We infused the selective dopamine1 receptor agonist, fenoldopam mesylate (SKF 82526 J), to evaluate hemodynamic and neurohumoral changes during continuous intravenous infusion in patients with congestive heart failure and compared them with the effects of nitroprusside, a traditional vasodilator that works by a distinctly different mechanism. In 15 patients with a mean radionuclide ejection fraction of 17%, the agents were infused in a random-ordered, double-blinded, crossover, active drug-controlled protocol after optimal dosing was determined during a titration period. Hemodynamic changes were induced in minutes with both drugs during a mean (+/- standard deviation) infusion dose of 1.45 +/- 1.66 micrograms/kg/min for fenoldopam and 2.99 +/- 1.59 micrograms/kg/min for nitroprusside. At 1 hour, mean blood pressure decreased and cardiac index rose with both drugs, and the effect lasted throughout the 6-hour infusion period. Nitroprusside, but not fenoldopam, reduced right heart filling pressures (including mean pulmonary capillary wedge, mean right atrial, and mean pulmonary artery pressures) during the infusion period. Both drugs caused significant reduction in systemic vascular and pulmonary arteriolar resistances. No significant change occurred in plasma norepinephrine levels. Fenoldopam ameliorates some of the adverse hemodynamic changes that occur during heart failure but does not reduce right heart filling pressures as does nitroprusside. Because of fenoldopam's unique characteristics, it may benefit certain patients with heart failure.\r"

Proven diagnoses were coronary disease in five patients, coronary plus valvular disease in three, valvular disease in seven, and miscellaneous in four. Localized septal hypertrophy was the only cardiac diagnosis in seven patients. The ratio of the thickness of the hypertrophied area to that of the adjacent septum was greater than or equal to 1.7 (mean 1.93 +/- 0.19) in all patients. The ration of the length of the hypertrophied portion (mean 0.34 +/- 06) to the length (apex to base) of the septum was less than 0.39 in all but one patient. Although the mitral valve tended to be more anterior than expected in 20, other features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were generally lacking. Of four patients undergoing left ventricular angiography, the bulge was identified in only one in whom cranial-caudal angulation was added to the 60-degree left anterior oblique view. An autopsy was performed in one patient; the hypertrophy was identified, although results of microscopic examination showed no fiber disarray. These data suggest that, in most instances, localized septal hypertrophy is an incidental echocardiographic finding. The diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should generally not be made on the basis of this feature alone.\r"

In 65 patients with pericardial effusion, the severity of cardiac tamponade was estimated on the basis of the percentage increase in cardiac output resulting from pericardiocentesis: absent = less than 20% (n = 24), mild = 20% to 49% (n = 9), and moderate or severe = greater than or equal to 50% (n = 32). The accuracy of a delta SYST greater than 12 mm Hg and % delta SYST greater than 9% in the identification of tamponade was 92% and 97%, respectively. A % delta SYST greater than 15% with relative hypotension (expiratory systolic pressure less than or equal to 120 mm Hg) or a delta SYST greater than 25 mm Hg or inspiratory pulse obliteration was found in 31 of 32 patients with moderate or severe tamponade compared to 2 of the 33 remaining patients.

  ".W": "With the use of a new echo contrast agent (ECA) that consists of a suspension with microbubbles (100% less than 3.9 micron in a moving system), we were able to opacify the left ventricle by peripheral intravenous injection in 124 of 130 patients (95%) without shunt connection. In 12 patients with aortic valve disease we measured the opacification of the right and left ventricles videodensitometrically by means of increasing doses. Dose 1 (8.7 ml ECA) and dose 4 (50 ml ECA) led to no significant difference in intensity in the right ventricle (168 +/- 32 vs 184 +/- 16 units, respectively; p greater than 0.05); however, opacification of the left ventricle was significantly more evident after dose 4 (60 +/- 60 vs 88 +/- 62 units, respectively; p less than 0.05). On the basis of the farthest distance reached by the regurgitant microbubbles from the aortic valve, the severity of regurgitation was graded on a four-point scale; the results were compared with those of aortography. A significant correlation (r = 0.98, n = 9) was found between ECA grading and aortography in the evaluation of the severity of aortic insufficiency. In addition, flow characteristics in patients with mitral stenosis, aortic insufficiency, and the regurgitation jet in incompetent aortic prosthesis in connection with diastolic inflow over the mitral valve were described. Moreover, it was possible to differentiate between inflow of ECA into the left atrium via an atrial septal defect and across the pulmonary vascular bed. No adverse effects were reported by the patients. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index, stroke volume index, and ejection fraction were determined before and after intravenous injection of increasing doses of ECA by means of the area-length method of Sandler and Dodge. Even after dose 4 we observed no significant changes in left ventricular function. The values before and after injection were in the range of intra- and interobserver reproducibility. Only three patients reported a slight taste sensation. In nine patients with a history of allergies there were no side effects.\r"

Our initial observations of earlier systolic partial closure with higher pulmonary pressures suggested that this phenomenon might relate to pressure. In 30 patients with documented pulmonary hypertension, the timing of systolic partial closure and the corresponding decrease in Doppler flow velocity related inversely to pulmonary artery pressure at catheterization. Peak flow preceded the systolic velocity decrease and also related inversely to pressure. Since changing flow velocity might reflect a changing driving force across the valve, we examined simultaneous high-fidelity catheter pressure tracings from the right ventricle and pulmonary artery from 24 patients with and without pulmonary hypertension. In 30 studies, a positive right ventricular to pulmonary artery pressure gradient was present early in systole, but the gradient decreased to a minimum value in mid-to-late systole. The timing of this minimum also related inversely to pressure. We conjectured that forces opposing ejection occur earlier in pulmonary hypertension, thereby decreasing the forward driving force and allowing earlier partial systolic closure.\r"

The Starr-Edwards valve showed the highest velocities, the Bjork-Shiley the lowest, and the bioprosthetic models showed velocities in between. A significant inverse relation between velocity and size, and standard deviations averaging +/- 14% enabled the technique to measure differences between sizes of the same model. Aortic regurgitation was detected in 24% of the patients. This study, conducted in well and stable patients, established values for maximal velocity across normally functioning aortic mechanical and tissue prostheses of different models and sizes. The intersubject variability was relatively small which, together with a previously shown minimal intrasubject variability, was testimony to a methodology that should prove useful in longitudinal postoperative evaluations.\r"

Mean intertracer variability of 15% exceeded mean intertechnician variability of 11%; this disparity was magnified in the subject who was technically difficult to image. Ninety-five percent confidence limits were: ejection fraction +/- 7%, average wall thickness +/- 9%, left ventricular mass +/- 12%, left ventricular end-diastolic volume +/- 11%, stroke volume +/- 14%, left ventricular end-systolic volume +/- 15%, and left atrial volume +/- 19%.

Eleven of the patients underwent surgical correction of major associated cardiac anomalies. One patient had His bundle ablation, and 25 patients had direct surgical division of 28 bypass tracts with the use of an endocardial approach. Successful division was achieved in 27 (96%; confidence limits 88% to 99%) of 28 bypass tracts identified pre- and intraoperatively. There were no hospital deaths, but on formal follow-up there were three late deaths, all occurring in patients with major associated cardiac pathology. Neither preexcitation nor reciprocating tachycardia recurred, and functional status was excellent among patients without associated cardiac lesions. Because of the safety and, at least on intermediate-term follow-up, apparently curative nature of this operation (particularly for patients without other major cardiac pathology), surgical treatment is recommended for patients with bypass tracts having lethal potential, those with reciprocating tachycardia unresponsive to drugs, and to symptomatic patients facing many years of medications.\r"

  ".W": "Biplane 30-degree RAO and 60-degree LAO RV selective cineangiography was performed in 21 patients with significant ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia in 14, salvos in three, and complex PVCs in seven) and a high presumption of arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia (ARVD), and in a control group of 10 presumed normal individuals. Comparing the two series revealed the lack of specificity of some angiographic images usually reported as suggestive signs of ARVD, such as slow dye evacuation of RV during the levophase and deep fissuring in the anterior wall with a \"pile of plates\" image. Inversely, localized morphologic and contraction abnormalities in the RV free wall were more sensitive and specific signs for diagnosis of ARVD; these were localized akinetic or dyskinetic bulges sometimes giving a true image of aneurysm (90%), wide and deep fissuring of the apex or of the inferior wall (33%), and large areas of akinesia. By order of frequency, these abnormalities were found on the apex in 71%, on the inferior wall in 52%, on the anterior wall in 48%, in the subtricuspid area in 38%, and on the pulmonary infundibulum in 33%. These localized lesions can suffice for the diagnosis of RV dysplasia in the absence of associated pathologies, such as ischemic heart disease or congenital defects. Usually a global RV systolic dysfunction is associated in ARVD, as confirmed by greater RV volumes (134 +/- 26 vs 79 +/- 10 ml/m2 for RVEDV, p less than 0.001; 76 +/- 34 vs 32 +/- 6 ml/m2 for RVESV, p less than 0.001), and lower RV ejection fraction (58 +/- 18% vs 47 +/- 8%, p less than 0.001) in the ARVD group compared to controls. Nevertheless, normal RV volumes and ejection fraction can be observed in some localized forms with mono- or bisegmental lesions in which RV systolic dysfunction is absent or moderate, and extensive forms with multiple segmental lesions where RV systolic dysfunction is constant and often severe. Six out of 21 patients in the ARVD group exhibited obvious global or segmental LV dysfunction, indicating the possibility of biventricular forms, as previously reported in other publications.\r"

Cardiac catheterization was done 50 +/- 20 days (mean + standard deviation) after AMI. Patients with positive responses more often had multivessel coronary artery disease (80 vs 47%, p = 0.001) and a greater than or equal to 75% narrowing in the left anterior descending (LAD) (87 vs 62%, p = 0.003) and left circumflex (71 vs 37%, p = 0.001) arteries, as well as in the proximal LAD segment before the first septal branch (58 vs 29%, p = 0.002). Among patients with positive responses 93% had normal or hypokinetic wall motion in the vascular territory of a severely diseased coronary artery (viable but potentially ischemic myocardium) while 63% of the negative-result group had these findings (p = 0.001). No difference in ejection fraction could be identified between the 2 groups (54 +/- 15% vs 54 +/- 16%). Prior studies of AMI patients have shown that ST-segment depression on a predischarge low-level exercise test will identify patients at higher risk of subsequent cardiac death. Our observations have identified differences in cardiac angiographic findings between patients with positive and negative responses to this test that may explain this difference in outcome.\r"

Two weeks after acute myocardial infarction, low HR variability predicted reduced long-term survival even after adjusting for clinical risk indicators, left ventricular ejection fraction, HR and ventricular arrhythmias. The present study elucidated the causes of differences in HR and HR variability between patients with low and high HR variability. In a matched-pair study, 10 patients with low HR variability (24-hour standard deviation of N-N intervals less than 50 ms) were randomly selected. For each of these 10 patients, a control patient with high HR variability (24-hour standard deviation of N-N intervals greater than or equal to 100 ms), matched for age, left ventricular ejection fraction and rales in the coronary care unit was selected. Patients who were taking either digitalis or beta-adrenergic blocking drugs were excluded. Analysis of 24-hour electrocardiograms showed that for the low HR variability group compared with the high: (1) the daytime and nighttime average HR was faster; (2) the difference between daytime and nighttime HR was less; (3) the proportion of differences greater than 50 ms between successive N-N intervals was smaller; and (4) the number of HR \"spikes\" per day (increase in HR greater than or equal to 10 beats/min, lasting from 3 to 15 minutes) was less.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Simple clinical data, available in all coronary care units, were recorded in 1,013 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In order to identify the patients at highest and lowest risk of mortality during hospital stay, a prognostic index was established from a stepwise logistic discriminant analysis of 10 clinical variables obtained at admission in a consecutive series of 477 patients hospitalized in 1 of 2 coronary care units admitting new patients on alternate days and treating them similarly. This prognostic index was applied to a comparison group of 536 consecutive patients admitted to the other coronary care unit. In the experimental group, 57 of the 477 patients (12%) died during hospital stay; 60 of the 536 patients (11%) died in the comparison group. As individual variables, age, previous history of AMI, anterior site and left ventricular function on admission were associated with increased mortality. Three variables were selected from the stepwise logistic discriminant analysis of the experimental group: age; site (anterior = 1, other = 0); and grade of left ventricular function (0 to 4). Prognostic index = 5.9019 - 0.8961 function - 0.5708 location - 0.0369 age. This index was validated in the comparison group. Patients were allocated into different classes with increasing index values associated with decreasing risk. Three subgroups of patients were identified: high risk of hospital mortality (index less than or equal to 1; mortality: 51%), intermediate risk (index 1 to 3; mortality: 18%) and low risk (index greater than 3; mortality: 4%). The use of this simple prognostic index may improve clinical management and selection of patients for intervention trials.\r"

  ".W": "To define the incidence of mitral regurgitation (MR) and elucidate its potential contribution to the development of severe congestive heart failure after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), Doppler echocardiograms were obtained within 48 hours of onset of AMI in 59 patients. The presence of MR was determined from the apical 4-chamber and parasternal long-axis views with pulsed Doppler. MR was detected in 23 of the 59 patients (39%) and was similarly frequent in patients with anterior (11 of 24 or 46%) and inferior AMI (12 of 34 or 35%). Patients with MR were older (71 +/- 3 vs 62 +/- 2 years, p less than 0.005), had a higher incidence of prior AMI (8 of 23 vs 4 of 36, p less than 0.05) and larger end-diastolic volume indexes by radionuclide ventriculography (112 +/- 9 vs 72 +/- 4, p less than 0.005). A systolic murmur was heard in only 10 of 23 patients with MR detected by Doppler. Mortality determined 8 to 14 months after the index AMI was 48% (11 of 23) in patients with MR but only 11% (4 of 30) in those without it (p less than 0.01). Thus, this study determined that clinically silent MR frequently complicates AMI and its presence is associated with and is a potential determinant of severe congestive heart failure and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "The quantification of left ventricular (LV) volumes and assessment of their relation to systolic and diastolic dysfunction, infarct size and anatomic location were performed in 54 patients with a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Blood pool radionuclide angiography was used to assess LV end-diastolic, end-systolic, and stroke volume indexes, ejection fraction and peak diastolic filling rate. Infarct size was estimated from plasma MB creatine kinase activity. Substantial LV dilation occurred within the initial 24 hours of AMI. The peak diastolic filling rate was low, even in those patients with a normal ejection fraction. In comparison with inferior AMI (n = 25), patients with anterior AMI (n = 29) had a larger end-diastolic volume index (105 +/- 8 vs 81 +/- 4 ml/m2, p less than 0.01) and end-systolic volume index (64 +/- 7 vs 37 +/- 4 ml/m2, p less than 0.001), but similar stroke volume index (41 +/- 3 vs 43 +/- 2 ml/m2, difference not significant). No significant relation was noted between infarct size estimated by MB creatine kinase and any volumetric index. On repeat study (day 10 after AMI), end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes increased further (p less than 0.05 vs day 1) but ejection fraction and peak diastolic filling rate were unchanged. It was concluded that: (1) LV dilation occurs within hours of AMI in both inferior and anterior AMI, but is more marked in the latter; (2) significant LV diastolic dysfunction is the rule, even in patients with preserved LV systolic function; and (3) LV dilation is an early compensatory mechanism that maintains normal stroke volume, even in patients with severely reduced LV function.\r"

All patients received streptokinase. Necrosis was diagnosed by new Q waves and an increase in plasma enzymes. Reperfusion was documented angiographically. Myocardial necrosis occurred in 72 patients and reperfusion in 70 patients, 58 of whom had myocardial necrosis. Of 27 patients with AIVR, 26 had both necrosis and reperfusion (p less than 0.001). AIVR started after a long coupling interval to the preceding sinus rhythm and was regular. Configuration depended on the reperfused infarct vessel. Reperfusion of the left anterior descending branch showed most configurations of AIVR and with the least QRS width. Reperfusion of the circumflex branch never had a left bundle branch block-like configuration. AIVR from reperfusion of the right coronary artery never had an inferior axis. AIVR occurring during persistent ischemic chest pain is a marker for both myocardial necrosis and reperfusion of the infarct vessel. AIVR starts with a long coupling interval and is regular. The QRS configuration may be useful for the noninvasive identification of the infarct vessel.\r"

Patients taking beta blockers were excluded from the study. It was found that the heart rate response to exercise was accentuated in group A at the time of discharge from hospital and that it became attenuated over 9 to 12 months. The blood pressure response was significantly increased over 9 to 12 months in group B. Persistence of ST elevation during exercise, 10 to 12 weeks after AMI, was diagnostic of an LV aneurysm. One year after AMI the sensitivity of ST elevation was 90%, specificity was 95% and the negative predictive value 90%.\r"

  ".W": "Despite initially favorable prognosis in patients with non-Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI), long-term mortality in this subset of patients appears to be similar to or even greater than that in patients with Q-wave AMI. The relatively poor late prognosis is primarily due to a high incidence of unstable angina and recurrent AMI. Between January 1982 and January 1987, 114 patients with suitable coronary narrowing underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for angina pectoris (present either at rest or during mild exertion, and despite optimal pharmacologic therapy), a median of 31 (range 2 to 362) days after a non-Q-wave AMI. Success was achieved in dilating the obstructed artery in 98 patients (113 of the 129 dilated arteries). Emergency bypass surgery was performed in 7 patients. Mean clinical follow-up of 20 (range 3 to 59) months was obtained in all patients and revealed no deaths. Of the 98 patients with successful PTCAs, 6 (6%) developed a nonfatal recurrent AMI and 62 (63%) were asymptomatic. However, recurrent angina affected 31 patients (32%) and was treated by repeat PTCA (n = 18), coronary bypass surgery (n = 5) or pharmacologic therapy (n = 8). At follow-up, 74% of the patients (73 of 98) were asymptomatic after a successful PTCA and, if necessary, a repeat PTCA, without incidence of recurrent AMI, coronary bypass surgery or death. The high initial success rate, low incidence of subsequent death and late recurrent AMI and sustained symptomatic benefit suggest that PTCA is an effective initial treatment strategy in these selected patients.\r"

  ".W": "The coronary morphology of ischemia-related arteries in unstable angina and Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been described. An eccentric stenosis with overhanging edges or irregular borders (type II eccentric) was seen in most lesions less than 100% occluded and probably represented plaque disruption, nonocclusive thrombus or both. The coronary morphology of non-Q AMI has not been described. Thus, the angiograms of 106 consecutive patients catheterized with either unstable angina (n = 73) or non-Q AMI (n = 33) and an identifiable ischemia-related artery were prospectively analyzed. Non-Q AMI was diagnosed by prolonged chest pain and new and persistent ST-T changes or creatine phosphokinase twice the normal level. The results showed a higher incidence of total occlusion of the ischemia-related artery in non-Q AMI (21%) compared with unstable angina (8%) (p = 0.1). The coronary morphology of nonoccluded ischemia-related arteries was similar with preponderance of type II eccentric lesions in both unstable angina and non-Q AMI. These lesions were found in 65% of ischemia-related arteries in non-Q AMI but were uncommon (3%) in nonischemia-related arteries with significant (50% to 100%) stenoses. Therefore, the type II eccentric lesion is a sensitive and specific marker of less than 100% occluded ischemia-related arteries in both unstable angina and non-Q AMI. These similarities in coronary morphology suggest a similar pathogenesis, which, as previously suggested, may relate to plaque disruption with or without thrombus. Unstable angina and non-Q AMI appear to represent part of a continuous spectrum of acute coronary artery disease. Further, the management of patients with non-Q AMI should be similar to patients with unstable angina and possibly include anticoagulation and consideration for early catheterization.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the clinical usefulness of intracoronary Doppler recordings during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), the changes of intracoronary blood flow velocity during PTCA were assessed in 20 patients with single proximal coronary stenosis, using a Doppler probe end-mounted on the tip of a PTCA catheter. A mean of 4 inflations was performed in each patient. Intracoronary velocities were measured before and after each inflation and during peak reactive hyperemia after each transluminal occlusion. Quantitative analysis of the coronary stenosis was assessed before and after PTCA, and the dilatation resulted in an increase in minimal luminal cross-sectional area from 1.1 +/- 0.8 to 2.7 +/- 1.2 mm2. A gradual and significant improvement in velocities was observed after the first 3 dilatations, but in 15 of the 20 patients the resting and hyperemic velocities were not affected by the fourth dilatation. Coronary flow reserve measured during reactive hyperemia after the last dilatation with the PTCA catheter across the lesion was 1.9. This value of coronary flow reserve is compatible with the residual stenosis measured after PTCA when corrected for the presence of the Doppler balloon catheter (0.68 mm2). This application of the Doppler technique may provide a new method of on-line functional monitoring of the PTCA procedure in individual patients, but does not yet allow an accurate prediction of the change in coronary geometry brought about by PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of continued cigarette smoking on restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was retrospectively determined through a study of 160 patients with primary success who underwent follow-up angiography after a mean of 7 +/- 7 months. The average number of narrowings at risk for restenosis was 1.7/patient in the 84 patients who continued to smoke (group 1) and 1.9/patient in the 76 patients who stopped smoking at the time of PTCA (group 2) (difference not significant). The 2 patient groups at baseline were similar with respect to gender, frequency of diabetes mellitus, number of pack/year smoking, angina class and number of diseased coronary arteries. The location of the dilated narrowings, the residual luminal diameter stenosis and the transstenotic gradient after the procedure were similar in both groups. The recurrence of angina greater than or equal to class II was the reason for restudy in 43% and 36% of group 1 and group 2 patients, respectively. Restenosis, defined as the presence of greater than or equal to 50% narrowing at the site of previous successful dilatation at follow-up angiography, was significantly higher in group 1 compared with group 2 patients (55% vs 38%, p = 0.03). Continued smoking was selected as an independent predictor of restenosis by logistic regression analysis. The incidence of coronary artery disease progression (14% vs 10%) was not significantly different between the 2 groups. In conclusion, continued smoking after successful PTCA is associated with an increased risk of restenosis. The higher restenosis rate in smokers emphasizes the need to strengthen educational programs after PTCA.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and twenty-lead body surface potential maps (BSPMs) were recorded at rest, at immediate cessation of exercise and after 1 (early) and 5 minutes (late) of recovery in 14 patients with isolated, critical, left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery stenosis. Exercise endpoints, at an average peak rate of 98 +/- 13, were usual pain worsening in 13 LAD patients, and diagnostic ST depression in lead V5 in 1 patient. Twelve patients also had positive thallium scans. BSPMs were also recorded in 8 normal subjects who exercised to peak heart rates similar to those of the LAD subjects. Spatially, there were similar exercise changes in QRS and ST-segment integral patterns over the precordium and inferior torso in both groups. These were transient in the control group but persisted to late recovery in the LAD group, particularly for ST integral. Quantitatively, multivariate analysis revealed significant temporal differences between the 2 groups. However, the only independent BSPM variable was the sum of ST integral decrease, averaging --2,323 +/- 1,809 microV.s for normal patients between rest and immediate cessation of exercise, compared with -3,828 +/- 2,329 microV.s for the LAD patients (p less than 0.05). Late recovery minus rest difference averaged -1,264 +/- 1,080 microV.s for normal subjects and -2,575 +/- 1,844 microV.s for LAD patients (p less than 0.01). To control for the physiologic changes of exercise, the ST integral temporal differential maps of the normal subjects were subtracted from those of the LAD patients and the sum of negative intergroup differences was assumed to reflect only ischemia. Correlation of ST integral ischemia values at immediate cessation of exercise and late recovery was high (r = 0.88); however, intertechnique correlations of the BSPM variables with quantitative angiographic scores and thallium perfusion scan scores revealed generally low r values (range 0 to 0.52). These data demonstrate that ischemic repolarization changes are detectable and quantifiable by BSPM at low levels of cardiac stress in patients with 1-vessel disease when the usual electrocardiographic criteria of myocardial ischemia are frequently absent. The data further suggest that ST integral changes reflective of myocardial ischemia persist well after the exercise recovery period and that they are complementary to, rather than substitutionary for, other indirect measures of myocardial ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Patients who have a decreased left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) may be denied coronary by-pass grafting (CABG) because it is assumed that improvement in function is unlikely. If the low LVEF were due to myocardial necrosis, this assumption would be valid. If the dysfunction were due to both necrosis and ischemia, however, then improvement may be possible with CABG. A method capable of identifying such patients would be useful. In this study, an \"ischemic index\" was determined for 37 patients based on the difference between the presurgical LVEF estimated from the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram by the Selvester QRS score (indicating the extent of dysfunction due to necrosis) and the presurgical LVEF measured from resting multigated radionuclide angiography (indicating dysfunction due to both necrosis and ischemia). It was hypothesized that a high ischemia index, that is, a large discrepancy between estimated and measured LVEF, would be associated with an improved post-surgical measured LVEF. The results showed that patients with an ischemic index of less than or equal to 0 had a mean decrease in LVEF of 8% (p = 0.02) and those with an index between 0 and 10 had no mean change. Patients with an index greater than or equal to 11, however, had a mean increase of 5% (p = 0.02), suggesting that depressed LVEF may improve following CABG among patients whose low function is due primarily to reversible ischemia as indicated by a high ischemic index.\r"

Nicorandil, 20 mg, was administered sublingually to 11 consecutive patients and 40 mg to 11 others. Systemic blood pressure decreased significantly without affecting the heart rate. Coronary sinus blood flow did not change significantly. As the mean aortic pressure decreased significantly by 13% after 20 mg and 21% after 40 mg of nicorandil, the calculated coronary vascular resistance decreased but did not reach statistical significance. There was a decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption (-14% and -22%, respectively), and this was consistent with a significant decrease in the calculated pressure-rate product of 19% and 24%, respectively. A total of 103 selected coronary segments, including 17 stenotic segments, were analyzed quantitatively using a computer-assisted coronary angiography analysis system. After 20 or 40 mg of nicorandil, a significant increase of the mean diameter was observed in the proximal (+9% and +7%), midportion (+10% and +11%) and distal (+15% and +13%) parts of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Corresponding values for the proximal (+13% and +10%) and distal (+10% and +15%) segments of the circumflex artery were observed. An increase in the obstruction diameter was also observed in all but 3 of the analyzed stenotic segments. The results demonstrate that nicorandil, in the route and doses used, causes a significant vasodilation in the major epicardial coronary segments, including most stenotic segments, and decreases the myocardial oxygen demand with little effect on the resistance vessels.\r"

Another test was done in 291 patients after blockade of the cardiac autonomous nervous system with 0.04 mg/kg of atropine and 2 mg/kg of labetolol. The frequency of positive results in the methergin test increased after blockade from 8 to 19% (p less than 0.01). The increase of positive results was especially obvious among patients with atypical chest pain (from 6 to 14%). Thus, frequency of spasm in these patients with normal coronary arteries or without significative lesions was 11%. This incidence was influenced by the composition of the patient population and increased with blockade of the cardiac autonomous nervous system.\r"

The first PES test was performed from 2 RV pacing sites (apex and outflow tract or septum) using the apex first in each patient. All patients underwent a second PES within 6 to 24 hours of the first; both studies used up to 4 ventricular extrastimuli, in the absence of antiarrhythmic treatment. The second PES was performed from a single RV apical site using a pacing catheter retained from the first study. During the first day's study, 74 patients (49%) had sustained ventricular tachycardia induced from the RV apex. Only 11 of the remaining 76 patients (7% of the total group) were inducible exclusively from a second RV pacing location during the first day's testing. Seven of these 11 patients, as well as 15 additional patients who did not have ventricular tachycardia induced from either site on the first day's study, were inducible from the RV apex during the second drug-free study. Among patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, limiting PES to a single RV site, with the option of performing a second study in those who are initially noninducible is more effective in inducing sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias than is PES performed from 2 RV pacing sites.\r"

Effective catheter ablation correlated with local ventriculoatrial (VA) intervals determined from the coronary sinus catheter at the site of earliest retrograde atrial activation during orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia.

In addition, electrical shorts occurring during the ablation procedure in 2 patients were identified and corrected only with oscilloscopic monitoring of voltage and current waveforms. Significant adverse sequelae were seen in 4 patients. Three patients required sternotomy for control of cardiac tamponade secondary to a ruptured coronary sinus and 1 patient had a small posterior left ventricular infarction related to spasm of a right coronary artery extension branch.

Twelve of these patients also underwent hemodynamic study with cardiac function determined at 5 different pacemaker settings: ventricular demand pacing and dual chamber sequential pacing at 0 or 25, 150, 200 and 250 ms programming atrioventricular (AV) delay. The time delay from right atrial pacing artifact to onset and peak of mitral A wave was linearly related to the time from atrial pacing artifact to LA depolarization on the esophageal lead (p less than 0.001). As pacing mode changed from dual chamber sequential pacing (DVI) mode to atrial synchronous-ventricular pacing (VDD), the A wave came earlier relative to the ventricular pacing spike, linearly related to the LA to ventricular extension with mode change determined with the esophageal lead (r = 0.94, p less than 0.001). The time from atrial pacing to peak of A wave was shorter in patients whose optimal programmed AV delay was 150 ms compared with those whose optimal AV delay was 200 or 250 ms (p less than 0.02).

Eight patients (42%) insisted on early crossover, from VVI to DDD pacing, after only 1.8 +/- 1.4 weeks because of symptoms consistent with pacemaker syndrome.

ATP produced dose-dependent prolongation of spontaneous sinus cycle length. The mean maximal increase in sinus cycle length was 294 +/- 60 ms (n = 10). The mean dose of ATP required to produce this maximal sinus cycle length prolongation was 3.5 +/- 1.0 mg. The dose-response curve for sinus cycle length prolongation was sigmoid in shape with an EC50 of 0.39 mg derived from a median effect plot. There was a negative correlation between the control sinus cycle length and the dose of ATP required to produce the maximal prolongation of cycle length (p less than 0.05). In contrast, the mean dose of ATP producing AV block was 4.4 +/- 0.97 mg and the EC50 was 2.98 mg. There was a positive correlation between the AV nodal functional refractory period and the prolongation of the AH interval with a 2 mg dose (p less than 0.05). Consistent with the AV nodal dose-response curves, 8 mg ATP terminated paroxysmal reentrant supraventricular tachycardia at the AV node in 8 of 9 patients. Thus, SN and AV node responses to ATP have differences in their electrophysiologic correlates and EC50. These findings suggest that ATP has potentially different mechanisms of action on SN automaticity and AV nodal conduction that requires further investigation.\r"

Seven patients had tachycardia requiring only the atria for perpetuation and developed increased AV nodal block (minimum effective adenosine dose range 37.5 to 350 micrograms/kg, mean 131). Thirteen had AV reciprocating tachycardia or AV node reentry tachycardia (minimum effective adenosine dose range 37.5 to 225 micrograms/kg, mean 114). Four other patients received adenosine to rule out preexcitation (minimum effective adenosine dose range 37.5 to 375 micrograms/kg, mean 165). One of the 25 patients had junctional ectopic tachycardia and adenosine administration caused retrograde AV block. Six of the 25 (24%) had noticeable but minor side effects.

A significant (p less than 0.01) increase occurred after propranolol in the mean spontaneous cycle length (mean change 122 ms) and the AH interval (mean 28 ms). The HV interval did not change significantly. The effective refractory period of the His-Purkinje system increased in 4 of 5 patients (mean net change 44 ms, p greater than 0.10). In 7 patients with phase 3 infranodal block, the longest cycle length for producing block increased after propranolol in 5 and remained unchanged in 2 (mean increase 40 ms, p less than 0.02). Two patients showed phase 4 atrioventricular block. Propranolol increased the critical cycle length by an average of 120 ms. Propranolol-induced bradycardia restored stable atrioventricular conduction in 2 patients with intermittent 2:1 block but facilitated the occurrence of high grade infranodal block in 1 patient. Thus, propranolol can impair His-Purkinje conduction in patients with preexisting infranodal abnormalities.\r"

Clinical, exercise test and arteriographic data were analyzed along with follow-up data during a mean of 43 months. Of the 50 patients, 37 had exercise-induced left BBB and 13 had exercise-induced right BBB. Significant coronary artery disease (CAD) was diagnosed in 26 of 37 patients (70%) with exercise-induced left BBB and in all 13 patients (100%) with exercise-induced right BBB. In patients who underwent coronary arteriography, data demonstrated a high prevalence of proximal left anterior descending disease (17 of 20, 85%). Follow-up data revealed that exercise-induced BBB was associated with a 36% (18 of 50) incidence of coronary events, including 16 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and 2 hospitalized for congestive heart failure. Results indicated that exercise-induced BBB was infrequent and occurred primarily in association with CAD, had a high prevalence of proximal left anterior CAD, infrequently had similar onset and offset heart rates, was reproducible and associated with a greater incidence of coronary artery bypass grafting than had been previously reported, although the incidence of cardiac events was similar to those investigations.\r"

  ".W": "Dynamic functional block in 1 limb of a reentrant circuit (\"linking\") can be maintained by either repetitive interference or collision of successive impulses entering the circuit. Occurrence of linking by collision during attempted overdrive pacing of reentrant tachycardias accounts for the entrainment phenomenon. To investigate whether linking by collision can be initiated in the absence of preexisting tachycardia, a human reentrant circuit model was studied. The model consisted of the atrioventricular node and His-Purkinje system as anterograde limb and an electronic stimulator that served as \"retrograde limb\" by initiating a paced atrial impulse at a predetermined ventriculoatrial interval following each sensed ventricular depolarization. In 3 patients with intact ventriculoatrial conduction, \"reentrant tachycardia\" was initiated by a ventricular extra-stimulus (V2), which retrogradely blocked bilaterally below the His bundle. When this same V2 was followed, instead, by a paced V2V2 train at a cycle length equal to the programmed ventriculoatrial interval of the \"tachycardia,\" it could be shown that each beat of the train not only \"traversed\" the simulated \"retrograde limb\" but also retrogradely collided with a prior circulating impulse in the anterograde limb of the circuit, thereby constituting linking by collision at a supra-Hisian level with inability of even a single \"reentrant cycle\" to be completed; \"tachycardia\" became manifest only after termination of the V2V2 train. The findings suggest the existence of a unique mechanism for initiation of certain clinical reentrant tachycardias during incremental pacing.\r"

Heart rate (HR), corrected SN recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time were measured before (basic) and after (intrinsic) autonomic blockade (propranolol 0.2 mg/kg plus atropine 0.04 mg/kg intravenously). Percent of autonomic chronotropies of the SN function were calculated by the following formulas: (1)--(intrinsic HR--basic HR/intrinsic HR) X 100; (2) (intrinsic corrected SN recovery time--basic corrected SN recovery time/intrinsic corrected SN recovery time) X 100; (3) (intrinsic sinoatrial conduction time--basic sinoatrial conduction time/intrinsic sinoatrial conduction time) X 100. Basic HR, basic corrected SN recovery time and basic sinoatrial conduction time did not vary with age. Intrinsic HR decreased with age, but this correlation was weak (r = -0.54, p less than 0.001). Intrinsic corrected SN recovery time and intrinsic sinoatrial conduction time tended to increase with age (r = 0.26, p less than 0.05; r = 0.29, p less than 0.05, respectively). Percent chronotropies of HR, corrected SN recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time were negative values in younger patients and positive values in elderly patients; they correlated positively with age (r = 0.59, p less than 0.001; r = 0.60, p less than 0.001; r = 0.43, p less than 0.001, respectively). Thus, the basic SN function did not change with age, while the intrinsic SN function deteriorated with age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The feasibility of this approach as a tool for detecting improvement of LV function was studied in 16 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Measurements were made daily for 6 consecutive days. The daily variability of peak acceleration examined in 11 normal subjects was +/- 2 m/s/s. In 11 of 16 patients with CHF, peak acceleration increased more than 2 m/s/s by day 6 compared with day 1 (group 1). In 5 of 16 patients, peak acceleration remained unchanged (group 2). In group 1, peak acceleration was 11 +/- 1 m/s/s on day 1 and increased to 16 +/- 1 m/s/s on day 6 (p less than 0.001). In this group, CHF resolved by day 6 in 9 of 11 patients. In group 2, peak acceleration was 9 +/- 1 m/s/s on day 1 and remained unchanged through day 6. In these 5 patients, the signs and symptoms of CHF persisted through day 6. The results suggest that peak acceleration measured noninvasively with continuous wave Doppler can detect improvement of LV function in patients with CHF. The approach provides a simple and reliable bedside means for serial evaluation of LV systolic function.\r"

However, few data are available regarding the effect of AR on noninvasive estimates of aortic valve area by the continuity equation. Therefore, 25 patients with angiographically documented severe AR and peak systolic aortic velocities of greater than 2.5 m/s were studied by continuous wave Doppler to determine the accuracy of pressure gradient and aortic valve area calculations in assessing the severity of aortic stenosis (AS) in this patient population. Peak instantaneous pressure gradient showed a general correlation to but was overestimated by Doppler (r = 0.78, Doppler = 0.70 catheter + 19.9) and did not predict aortic valve area. Mean pressure gradient by Doppler correlated more closely with catheter mean gradient (r = 0.86, Doppler = 0.79 catheter + 6.1) but was a poor predictor of the severity of AS. In contrast, the continuity equation accurately predicted the aortic valve area by catheterization (r = 0.92, Doppler = 0.89 catheter -0.08). Thus, the continuity equation provides a reliable estimate of aortic valve area in patients with severe AR and should be used to evaluate the extent of AS in such patients when high systolic aortic velocities are present.\r"

  ".W": "Most echocardiographic laboratories now use continuous-wave Doppler to measure transvalvular pressure gradients in patients with valvular aortic stenosis (AS). In many cases, particularly in the elderly, this technique can be difficult and time-consuming, and there is no immediate means of verifying the accuracy of the results. In the present study, a new and simple method is proposed to calculate maximal aortic valve gradients from the pulsed-wave Doppler tracing recorded in the left ventricular outflow tract. The method consists of calculating maximal aortic flow velocity and thus the maximal gradient by extrapolating to their point of intersection the initial accelerating velocity and the terminal decelerating velocity recorded on the pulsed Doppler tracing. In 20 patients with varying degrees of AS, there was an excellent correlation (r = 0.96, p less than 0.001) between the results obtained by this method and those obtained by continuous-wave Doppler. In 10 patients who had cardiac catheterization, the results also correlated well with the maximal gradient (r = 0.93, p less than 0.001) measured at cardiac catheterization. Because the method is simple, it should become an integral part of the Doppler examination in patients with AS. Its main advantages will be to serve as an independent confirmation of the results obtained by continuous-wave Doppler and to reduce in many patients the duration of the examination.\r"

The patients were intensively observed by color flow Doppler every day from the day of hospitalization up to 12 days after the onset of the disease and 2 or more times a week thereafter, for up to 28 days. Mitral regurgitation (MR) was found in 9 patients (47%) and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in 10 (53%). MRs were of transient type and confirmed from 7.5 +/- 1.6 (mean +/- standard deviation) to 13.1 +/- 6.5 days after the onset of the disease. Both types of valvular regurgitation were mild. The direction of regurgitation was from the center of valvular coaptation toward the posterior wall of the atrium. Neither valvular prolapse nor valvular deformity was noted. In patients with MR, left ventricular ejection fraction on M-mode echocardiography was significantly lower in the acute phase than in the convalescent phase of the disease (p less than 0.05). Using gallium-67 scintigram, the positive uptake of the isotope was noted in 7 (88%) of 8 patients with MR, but not found at all in 8 patients free of MR. These results suggest that MR and TR are often transient in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease and could be attributed to myocarditis.\r"

Computer-assisted analysis of the M-mode echocardiograms identified abnormalities of diastolic function (impaired left ventricular filling) in patients with sickle cell anemia compared with the normal subjects. The abnormal EF response group had significantly more impaired diastolic function and did less exercise than the normal EF response group. Both groups of patients had a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume during exercise. The patients with sickle cell anemia had abnormalities of systolic and diastolic function on echocardiographic and radionuclide testing. The abnormalities in diastolic and systolic function assumed greater significance at the increased heart rates associated with exercise, accounting for the decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and the abnormal EF response, and contributed to exercise intolerance in patients with sickle cell anemia.\r"

Changes in left ventricular (LV) size and function were assessed with noninvasive techniques (echocardiography and sphygmomanometer). Data were obtained at baseline, at 20 seconds of the strain phase (phase II) and 10 seconds after the release of strain (phase IV). In the control state (before propranolol), blood pressure decreased during phase II and exceeded baseline after the release of strain (\"overshoot\") in phase IV; after the administration of propranolol, the pressure overshoot characteristic of phase IV was no longer present. End-diastolic dimension decreased during the strain phase, but returned to baseline values during recovery in both control and propranolol states. LV stress-dimension and stress-shortening relations before and after propranolol indicate that an increase in LV contractility beginning during phase II and extending into phase IV was attenuated after propranolol. Although the absence of phase IV blood pressure overshoot may be clinically useful in identifying patients with impaired left ventricular function, beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents can also produce this hemodynamic response in the presence of normal ventricular function.\r"

No other clinical, echocardiographic or electrocardiographic indicators of postpericardiotomy syndrome were related to Ga-67 uptake. No patient developed cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis during the 12-week follow-up and the Ga-67 scan results did not predict the occlusion of coronary artery bypass grafts.

  ".W": "Treatment of arterial hypertension is an important part of the medical care provided in industrialized countries today. Its rationale comes from large-scale intervention trials which have shown that lowering of elevated blood pressure reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, during the last few years it has been shown that treated hypertensive patients are still at an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with untreated normotensive subjects of the same age and sex. Possible explanations for this disappointing finding are that blood pressure has not been lowered to strictly normotensive levels; that some elements of the excess morbidity and mortality are not prevented by antihypertensive therapy, e.g., the part attributable to coronary artery disease; or that the drugs used may themselves have negative effects, e.g., on serum lipids, which may offset the positive effects of lowered blood pressure. It is desirable that antihypertensive treatment produces a reversal of hypertension-induced structural cardiovascular changes such as left ventricular hypertrophy or increased wall/lumen ratio in the precapillary blood vessels, but many of the current antihypertensive drug regimens have no effect on structural cardiovascular changes. Against this background it would appear logical to make renewed efforts to reduce blood pressure into the clearly normotensive range in an attempt to lower the excess risk demonstrable in treated hypertensive patients. It would also seem logical to use antihypertensive drugs that could also be expected to have positive effects on hypertension-induced structural cardiovascular changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, nonselective beta blockade carries distinct circulatory disadvantages, which accounts for the search for an \"ideal\" beta-blocking drug for use in this extensive therapeutic field. It is possible to define the desirable cardiodynamic profile of a beta-blocking drug. How far does celiprolol meet this function? What questions should we address in attempting to evaluate the effects of celiprolol on the heart? In contrast to propranolol, in the normal heart, celiprolol does not depress left ventricular pumping function. There is little information on the effects of celiprolol on left ventricular function in the hypertensive patient. However, we now know that most patients with hypertension already have advancing coronary artery disease. It is reasonable, therefore, to examine the effects of celiprolol on left ventricular function in patients with coronary disease because these can not only be used to evaluate the possible efficacy of the drug in patients with angina pectoris, but also to extrapolate to their clinical effectiveness in most patients with hypertension. Celiprolol does not depress left ventricular pumping function at rest or during exercise, in contrast to other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists that reduce both heart rate and left ventricular activity. Moreover, celiprolol possesses anti-ischemic properties equivalent to those of atenolol. It does not appear to aggravate the atherogenic profile of the lipids as much as some other cardioselective beta-blocking drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The preliminary findings in a series of 14 patients (average age 39.7 years) with essential hypertension (World Health Organization stages I to II) who were treated with celiprolol for a period of 6 months are presented. Serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein remained virtually unchanged during treatment. There was, however, a tendency for triglyceride levels to fall with celiprolol treatment, a trend that became significant after 4 weeks. Moreover, high-density lipoproteins tended to increase with treatment and were significantly increased after 2 weeks. In contrast to findings obtained with other beta-blocking agents, no increases in total serum lipids were observed during celiprolol treatment. Blood pressure values of the subjects treated decreased significantly from a mean value (measured in the upright position) of 151/99 to 131/87 mm Hg. Blood pressure values taken in the supine position were also significantly reduced. No significant changes were noted in a variety of laboratory parameters, including blood count, blood coagulation time, blood sugar concentration, liver and kidney tests, electrolyte levels and urinalysis. The significance of these results, which suggest that celiprolol is not associated with adverse changes of lipids and may even positively influence blood chemistry, is discussed.\r"

Celiprolol has been shown in preclinical studies to be a beta 1-selective antagonist with bronchosparing and vasodilating properties, but without any cardiodepressant effect. This has been confirmed by clinical studies undertaken to date. The aim of the present study was to examine the acute effects of intravenous celiprolol on the cardiac hemodynamics of patients pretreated with oral atenolol.\r"

Measurements of diastolic filling were made from gated technetium-99m radionuclide angiograms with postbeat rejection of data outside a 5% RR-interval window. LV time-activity curves were generated and the rapid-filling phase fit with a 3 degrees polynomial to calculate the peak filling rate and the time from end-systole to the point of peak filling. All patients had a radionuclide angiogram performed before and after 0.25 to 3 years of oral verapamil therapy. Verapamil did not change the LV ejection fraction but increased the peak filling rate (3.24 +/- 0.15 to 4.62 +/- 1.05 end-diastolic volume/s,p less than 0.01) and reduced the time to peak filling (217 +/- 57 to 168 +/- 63 ms, p less than 0.01). An increase in exercise endurance as measured by exercise treadmill test and subjective symptomatic improvement were also seen after verapamil therapy. Thus, in children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, symptomatic improvement and LV diastolic filling parameters improved with long-term oral verapamil.\r"

This study determined the incidence of congenital cardiac malformations in relatives of patients with either truncus arteriosus (TA) or interruption of the aortic arch (IAA) seen between 1955 and 1985. Prior to this study, only 2 cases of IAA in siblings had been reported and the recurrence risk of TA had been estimated at 1.2%. In the families of 36 index cases of IAA, there were 98 siblings, 2 with congenital cardiac malformations (2.1%). All recurrences were in IAA type B families. Single cases of congenital cardiac malformations were found in second- and third-degree relatives and 2 cases in more distant relatives. In the families of 49 index cases of TA, there were 106 siblings, 7 with congenital cardiac malformations (6.6%). Two had TA, 3 had other conotruncal anomalies and 2 had other congenital cardiac malformations. Two parents had congenital cardiac malformations, 1 with TA and 1 with conotruncal malformation. Among second- and third-degree relatives, 7 had congenital cardiac malformations (5 were conotruncal, including 1 half sibling). Among greater than third-degree relatives, 3 had congenital cardiac malformations. Thus, in IAA, the recurrence rate of congenital cardiac malformations (2.1%) was higher than expected and could be related to the etiology of IAA type B as a conotruncal malformation. In TA, the recurrence rate of congenital cardiac malformations was 6.6%, higher than previously reported. When TA was complex the recurrence risk was higher (13.6%). These findings must be taken into consideration for satisfactory genetic counseling.\r"

Sixty patients with d-TGA who had the Mustard repair were evaluated by electrophysiologic studies. Thirty-three (55%) had inducible sustained atrial flutter; 17 of them developed spontaneous clinical episodes of atrial flutter (clinical atrial flutter group) and 16 did not (nonclinical atrial flutter group). In 6 of the 17 patients (35%) with clinical inducible atrial flutter, the condition was first documented in the electrophysiologic laboratory with subsequent development of spontaneous clinical episodes. Catheter endocardial mapping, used to determine atrial activation sequences and and conduction intervals, revealed intraatrial conduction delays with late activation of the low atrial sites in all patients. Abnormalities of atrial refractoriness were present, with a greater dispersion of atrial refractoriness found in the clinical atrial flutter group. Severe abnormalities of sinus nodal function appeared to a significantly greater degree among patients who had clinical episodes of atrial flutter. These electrophysiologic abnormalities and associated arrhythmias may predispose patients with d-TGA to sudden death.\r"

Eighty-two tentative dilatations were performed in patients with pulmonary stenosis and 61 in patients with aortic stenosis. The hemodynamics of the right and left heart were monitored during inflation-deflation time. From selected tracings mean beat-to-beat pressures curves were constructed during occlusion-recovery time. The cycle length (RR interval) did not change significantly during occlusion, except for patients with pulmonary occlusion and patent foramen ovale, where a significant increase in cycle length (p less than 0.01) was observed during recovery time. The mean maximal increase in ventricular pressure reached 95% of basal values for the right ventricle and 58% for the left ventricle. The hypertension was retrogradely transmitted to all cardiac chambers. Angiographic observations during occlusion suggest that the atrioventricular valves and the foramen ovale, when patent, become escape orifices during occlusion, for adapting and relieving intracavitary pressures. The ventricle seems to adapt to sudden occlusion by generating hypertensive and hypokinetic contractions, with atrioventricular regurgitation.\r"

Volumes were calculated by the area-length method from casts ranging from 1.4 to 48.9 ml obtained from 30 postmortem cases with heart disease. The casts were divided into 2 groups: group I (n = 17) with abnormal and group II (n = 13) with normal right ventricular hemodynamics. Biplane cinegrams were taken in the anterolateral, anterior and long axial oblique, hepatoclavicular and sitting-up projections. The true volume of each cast was determined from its weight and specific gravity. In both groups, excellent correlations were obtained between measured and true volumes (r = 0.92 to 0.99) in all projections, although each projection overestimated the true volume (slope value less than 1). The regression equations obtained from group I were significantly different from those in group II in all views (p less than 0.025 to 0.05), with smaller mean differences and standard errors of the estimate. These data support the concept that right ventricular hemodynamics influence ventricular septal position and, therefore, LV geometry and measured volumes. Appropriate regression equations are required to allow volume calculation from multiple projections.\r"

From Doppler mitral flow velocity profiles, the percent of LV filling due to atrial systole (percent atrial contribution) and at one-third of diastole (one-third filling fraction), the peak filling rate and the peak filling rate normalized for LV end-diastolic volume and the time from mitral valve opening to peak early velocity and from aortic valve closure to peak early velocity were determined. Good correlations were found between percent atrial contribution (r = 0.83) and one-third filling fraction (r = 0.67) using the 2 techniques. However, Doppler normalized peak filling rate correlated only weakly with radionuclide peak filling rate (r = 0.33, p less than 0.05). There was no significant correlation between Doppler peak filling rate and radionuclide peak filling rate. Neither Doppler time from mitral valve opening to peak early velocity nor Doppler time from aortic closure to peak early velocity correlated with radionuclide time to peak filling rate. Thus, Doppler echocardiography and radionuclide angiography agree on relative diastolic filling indexes but not on peak filling rates or useful diastolic time intervals. Relative filling indexes, such as percent atrial contribution and one-third filling fractions, therefore, may be the most reliable noninvasive indicators of diastolic function.\r"
