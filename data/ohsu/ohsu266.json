Biopsy specimens of normal mucosa (n = 10), hyperplastic polyps (n = 10), adenomas with low-grade dysplasia (n = 20), adenomas with high-grade dysplasia (n = 10), and invasive adenocarcinomas (n = 10) of the large bowel were studied. Labeling index and cell proliferative patterns were analyzed. No statistically significant difference was found in labeling index between normal mucosa and hyperplastic polyps or between adenomas with high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinomas. The labeling index was significantly lower in normal mucosa and in hyperplastic polyps than in adenomas and adenocarcinomas (p less than 0.001). The difference in labeling index between adenomas with high-grade dysplasia and low-grade dysplasia was also statistically significant (0.01 less than p less than 0.05). In normal mucosa and in hyperplastic polyps the proliferative zone was confined to the lower two-thirds of the crypt; no kinetic activity was found in the upper portions of the crypt or in surface epithelium. In adenomas the labeled cells were either present in the upper third or scattered along the whole axis of the crypt and in the surface epithelium. Labeling patterns in invasive carcinomas were similar to those observed in adenomas with high-grade dysplasia. The difference in proliferative patterns between hyperplastic polyps and adenomas supports a different significance of the two polypoid lesions in the histogenesis of large bowel cancer; our results confirm the subsequent steps of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Immunohistochemical labeling patterns observed with monoclonal antibody to bromodeoxyuridine in polypoid and cancer lesions of the large bowel are similar to those described by autoradiographic studies.\r"

We utilized conventional histology and Smith's silver technique for visualizing the myenteric plexus. Neurons within the myenteric plexus were quantified in sections stained with each technique. The abdominal vagus nerves from 5 diabetics (2 with gastroparesis) and 12 nondiabetic controls were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Gomori trichrome, luxol-fast blue, and Holmes' silver stains. There were no abnormalities in the numbers or appearance of neurons or axons in the myenteric plexus of the stomach of diabetics, with or without gastroparesis. Also absent were abnormalities of the smooth muscle or vagus nerve. Thus, no morphologic abnormalities of the gastric wall or abdominal vagus were identified in diabetic gastroparesis.\r"

The role of colonic epithelial cells in oxidation-reduction of nitrite and consequent control of nitrite and nitrate levels is unknown. Isolated rat colonocytes and isolated loops of colon were used to study oxidation and reduction of nitrate and nitrite. Colonocytes oxidized nitrite to nitrate at a rate of 162 +/- 33 nmol/min.g (dry wt) (n = 6) over 0-20 min, a value increased by addition of 5 mM glucose and 1 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (p = less than 0.01), but not altered by antibiotics. Nitrite oxidation correlated linearly with the dry weight of isolated colonocytes (r = 0.92), indicating a cellular reaction. Nitrite was absorbed at a rate of 0.28 nmol/min.cm2 (n = 9) from the colonic lumen, which reflected 74% absorption of the available nitrite. Of the absorbed nitrite, 14.3% reappeared in the colonic lumen as nitrate. Colonocytes may be important in oxidizing nitrite to nitrate, thus preventing excess nitrite from entering into the circulation and returning some nitrate to the colonic lumen for respiration by anaerobic bacteria. The interaction of nitrites and colonocytes deserves further study with regard to the oxidation-reduction of nitrite and to the development of colonic neoplasia in chronic diarrheal conditions.\r"

However, it may be an acid-sensitive microbe and before it can be implicated in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer, it should be consistently found in ulcer patients with normal acid secretion. Thirty-six patients with C. pylori by Warthin-Starry stain underwent gastric analysis; 25 were normochlorhydric and 11 hypochlorhydric. Ulcers were present in 19 normochlorhydric patients (10, gastric; 9, duodenal) and 2 hypochlorhydric patients (gastric). Median basal acid output was higher for those with duodenal ulcer (38 mmol/h) than gastric ulcer (28 mmol/h) or miscellaneous endoscopic features (33 mmol/h). The hypergastrinemia seen in 12 patients with negative secretin provocation tests was believed to be due to various nongastrinoma conditions. Campylobacter pylori was found in 6 normogastrinemic patients with elevated acid output and in 1 gastrinoma patient with marked acid hypersecretion. Histologic chronic gastritis was present in all subjects and 29 had active chronic gastritis. Twenty-three patients were taking H2-receptor antagonists at the time of diagnosis which did not seem to interfere with culture results. Using standard acid secretory tests, we conclude that C. pylori can survive in a wide range of acid conditions.\r"

The effect of ingesting a drink containing 20 g of lactulose on stool output and breath hydrogen production was measured in 13 normal volunteers before and during administration of ampicillin (2 g/day). Small bowel and whole gut transit times were also measured to exclude any direct effect of ampicillin on motor activity. Ingestion of lactulose did not increase stool weight or frequency under control conditions, but during administration of ampicillin, lactulose caused increases in stool weight (p less than 0.02) and frequency (p less than 0.01), in the percentage of unformed stools (p less than 0.001), and in the excretion of galactose and fructose in stool samples collected from 2 volunteers. Administration of ampicillin also significantly reduced the area under the breath hydrogen profile (p less than 0.03). Mouth-to-cecum transit of the lactulose drink was prolonged during ampicillin ingestion (p less than 0.01) but there was no significant change in the whole gut transit time. These results suggest that ampicillin impairs colonic fermentation of carbohydrate and a diet high in unabsorbable carbohydrate increases the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.\r"

  ".W": "Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been used to increase the osmotic pressure of fluids used to cleanse the gastrointestinal tract. However, little is known about its osmotic activity. To investigate this activity systematically, solutions of PEG of differing molecular weights were made and subjected to measurement of osmolality by both freezing point depression and vapor pressure osmometry. Measured osmolality was increasingly greater than predicted from average molecular weight as PEG concentration increased. Measurement of sodium activity in NaCl/PEG solutions by means of an ion-selective electrode suggested that the higher than expected osmolality could be due in part to interactions that, in effect, sequestered water from the solution. Osmolality was consistently greater by freezing point osmometry than by vapor pressure osmometry. To determine which osmometry method reflected biologically relevant osmolality, normal subjects underwent steady-state total gut perfusion with an electrolyte solution containing 105 g/L of PEG 3350. This produced rectal effluent that was hypertonic by freezing point osmometry but isotonic by vapor pressure osmometry. Assuming that luminal fluid reaches osmotic equilibrium with plasma during total gut perfusion, this result suggests that the vapor pressure osmometer accurately reflects the biologically relevant osmolality of intestinal contents. We conclude that PEG exerts more of an osmotic effect than would be predicted from its molecular weight. This phenomenon may reflect interactions between PEG and water molecules that alter the physical chemistry of the solution and sequester water from the solution.\r"

In this study, we purified brush border membrane vesicles enriched in ACE, and characterized the ACE with regard to (a) its stability in the membrane, (b) substrate hydrolysis kinetics compared with pulmonary endothelial ACE, and (c) pharmacologic interaction with Ramipril. These investigations resulted in the following findings. The uninhibited enzyme is stable in native membranes in vitro, with a half-life of 195 +/- 7 h. Kinetic analysis of ACE hydrolysis activity revealed the presence of a single enzyme species, which yielded a high Vmax and displayed a Km similar to purified ACE from lung endothelium. Brush border ACE was inhibited by Ramipril, one of the most specific and potent orally administered ACE inhibitors indicated for hypertension. We determined the brush border ACE value of IC50 = 3 X 10(-9) M Ramipril-diacid, which is the same value for serum and lung ACE. Brush border ACE remains 100% inhibited by 10 microM Ramipril during at least 8 days in vitro. The data indicate that ACE is a prominent jejunal brush border enzyme that behaves pharmacologically and kinetically like its peripheral circulation counterpart. This study suggests that high doses of orally administered ACE inhibitors may affect intestinal epithelial function.\r"

Venous pressure elevation and plasma dilution were used to increase capillary fluid filtration. Both perturbations produced concomitant increases in villous contraction frequency and lymph flow. A highly significant correlation (r = 0.83, p less than 0.001) was obtained between villous contraction frequency and lymph flow. This finding, coupled with the observation that stimulation of net fluid absorption increases villous contraction frequency, suggests that villous motility is increased by a myogenic response elicited by increments in interstitial fluid pressure. In another series of experiments local arterial pressure was reduced in 20-mmHg steps from 120 to 20 mmHg. Although blood flow fell proportionately to arterial pressure, villous contraction frequency and oxygen uptake were maintained at a normal level when arterial pressure was between 120 and 60 mmHg. Villous motility and oxygen consumption fell progressively as arterial pressure was reduced below 60 mmHg. This observation indicates that ischemia does not alter villous contraction frequency unless blood flow is reduced below the level necessary to maintain normal tissue oxygenation.\r"

Using a triple-lumen perfusion technique to determine jejunal absorption, cold pain significantly reduced net water absorption from 34.9 to 15.7 ml/30 cm.50 min (p less than 0.005), net sodium absorption from 2.6 to 0.2 mEq/30 cm.50 min (p less than 0.005), and net chloride absorption from 2.2 to 0.6 mEq/30 cm.50 min (p less than 0.02). These changes were associated with an elevation of blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine during cold pain. During the period following cold pain, systolic blood pressure remained significantly elevated and net jejunal water absorption significantly reduced. These results suggest that physical stress can influence jejunal absorption of salt and water in humans and support the possibility that the central and autonomic nervous systems have a physiologic role in the control of intestinal function.\r"

There was one early death from a cerebrovascular accident (30 day mortality, 4.2%). Cholangitis (30%) was the major early complication and stent blockage (40%) the major late complication; there were no complications directly attributable to radiotherapy. The median survival for patients with pancreatic carcinoma was 250 days and for cholangiocarcinoma, 300 days. This method is technically feasible and may prove safer than the transhepatic technique. The ability of intraluminal irradiation to improve palliation or lengthen survival in patients with malignant bile duct obstruction remains uncertain. Assessment by a prospective, controlled trial is essential.\r"

Gastrooesophageal acid reflux decreased (ns) during the treatment, but tended to return to basal values at the end. Oesophageal body motility was unchanged after healing, while the lower oesophageal sphincter basal tone was significantly increased at the end of the study in the postcibal period. The results suggest that the impairment of the sphincter tone in reflux oesophagitis is secondary to the presence of the oesophageal lesions. Macroscopic healing is not paralleled by improved major pathogenic factors of the disease, however--that is, acid reflux and oesophageal body motility.\r"

Nine normal subjects underwent manometric study using a multilumen tube with an attached inflatable balloon sited 10 cm below the sphincter. Sphincteric and oesophageal motor responses to six graded balloon inflations were recorded in each subject. The sphincter responded to distension with increasing rise in pressure, from a median value of 42.5 mmHg at lowest levels of distension to 95 mmHg at maximal tolerated distension. Non-swallow related contractile activity was stimulated in the oesophageal body proximal to the distension and increased in quantity as inflation progressed. Distal propagation of this secondary activity was progressively inhibited with increasing distension. These interrelated changes thus show the normal upper oesophageal clearance responses to intraluminal distension. It is suggested that their more widespread application, in addition to standard manometric techniques, might provide a more rational evaluation of those patients suspected to have impaired oesophageal clearance, but in whom standard manometry is non-diagnostic.\r"

During fasting, delivery of the solutions into the duodenum increased duodenal motor activity and intraduodenal pressure, the magnitude of the response increasing with osmolality. At the highest osmolalities, a regular duodenal motor pattern was induced in some individuals which was indistinguishable from fasting phase III activity. After feeding, hyperosmolar saline again increased motor activity. In addition, the transit of an intraduodenal marker to the caecum was accelerated. These findings support the concept that the duodenum is both sensitive and responsive to its intraluminal content. The motor responses additionally appear to function to clear excessively stimulating intraluminal material from the duodenal lumen and may also contribute to the 'postpyloric' resistance which is known to exert control of normal gastric emptying.\r"

  ".W": "Cholesterol synthesis, faecal bile acids and neutral sterols, and plasma squalene and free and esterified cholesterol precursor sterols concentrations were studied in patients with previous ileal resection (n = 30) or jejunoileal bypass (n = 9) to elucidate the responses of different cholesterol precursors to enhanced cholesterol synthesis induced by cholesterol and bile acid malabsorption. A subgroup of seven resection patients without fat and bile acid malabsorption served as controls. Of the resection patients, eight had a pure bile acid malabsorption and 15 a combination of fat, bile acid, and modest cholesterol malabsorption. In the patients with jejunoileal bypass, cholesterol and fat absorption was greatly decreased in addition to bile acid malabsorption. The overall cholesterol synthesis was associated with proportionately increased plasma contents of free (and, less consistently, esterified) methyl sterols, the most marked increase, up to 18 times, being recorded for free and esterified lathosterols. The concentrations of the precursor sterols were similarly increased in the subjects with bile acid and cholesterol malabsorption, the two lathosterols showing the highest correlations with the overall cholesterol synthesis (r = 0.820-0.941). In the subjects with jejunoileal bypass cholesterol malabsorption effectively regulated cholesterol synthesis and the precursor levels. Gut exclusions large enough to cause cholesterol and/or bile acid malabsorption activate cholesterol synthesis leading to a proportional elevation in the plasma concentrations of cholesterol precursors, especially in those of lathosterols and free methyl sterols. Determination of the plasma concentration of total lathosterol by a single gas-chromatographic run is a suitable method for rapid screening of clinically significant cholesterol and bile acid malabsorption.\r"

A 15 cm ileal segment was converted into a tied loop, in which the PEG's were deposited. Absorption from the ileal segment was then measured as six-hour urinary recovery of the PEg dose. Polyethyleneglycol absorption in Crohn's disease was greater than in cancer patients and similar throughout the weight range, but in the cancer patients it was inversely proportional to molecular weight. Thus there was significantly greater absorption of the higher weights (greater than or equal to 678 dalton) in the Crohn's, than in the cancer patients. The apparently increased permeability of the small intestine in Crohn's disease may be an important factor in its pathogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "88152569\r", 
  ".W": "A retrospective cohort of 823 patients with ulcerative colitis who resided at the time of diagnosis in one of three defined geographical areas (West Midlands region, Oxford region, England and Stockholm County, Sweden) was assembled. The patients were first seen at named hospitals in these areas and the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis established within five years of onset of symptoms between 1945-1965. All patients were 15 years of age or more at onset of disease and were followed for a minimum of 17 years and a maximum of 38 years. Ninety seven per cent completeness of follow up was achieved. Examining the colorectal cancer risk in the series relative to the risk in the general population by standardised morbidity ratios, there was an eight fold increased risk of cancer in the series as a whole. Dividing the series by extent of colitis, extensive colitis patients showed a 19 fold increase in risk. A four fold increased risk was shown in the remainder of the series (left sided colitis, proctitis and extent unknown). Life table analyses in extensive colitis gave cumulative risks of 7.2% (CI 3.6-10.8) at 20 years from onset of disease and 16.5% (CI 9.0-24.0) at 30 years from onset. No significant effect of age at onset, sex or referral centre could be detected. Examination of the data by interval from onset to cancer and by actual age at development of cancer suggests that patients who develop colorectal cancer will do so in a distribution around 50 years of age independent of duration of disease in adult onset ulcerative colitis (greater than 15 years at onset of disease). An inverse relationship was shown between age at onset of disease and interval from onset of disease to cancer. Further age specific rates for cancer increased up to 50 years and decreased thereafter. These results suggest that extensive colitis patients have a genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer and that longstanding inflammation is not of primary importance in the initiation/promotion of cancer in this disease.\r"

Patients with the irritable bowel syndrome had lower (p less than 0.05) pressures than controls before the meal. Postprandial sigmoid pressures were within the mean +/- 2 SD of controls in 10, above in two and below in eight patients with the irritable bowel.

The neutrophil content of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a cytoprotective enzyme, was also markedly diminished in Crohn's disease mean (SE) = 7.11 (0.23) ng SOD/micrograms DNA, p less than 0.05, and ulcerative colitis mean (SE) = 5.74 (0.42) compared with controls 7.84 (0.27), p less than 0.001. In contrast, the concentration of neutrophil elastase, a neutral protease, was found to be normal when compared with neutrophils from controls. The neutrophil O2-. production and the SOD concentrations were significantly and negatively correlated with the disease activity in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The results indicate diminished neutrophil function in peripheral blood of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as illustrated by a diminished oxidative system, which correlates with the disease activity.\r"

The greatest difference was with severe events, especially those involving the break-up of close relationships, which preceded the development of functional abdominal pain as often as they occurred before self-poisoning, and significantly more frequently than before the onset of organic gastrointestinal illness. Abdominal pain of recent onset, for which no organic cause is found, is often preceded by environmental stress, whether it presents to the surgeon or the physician. Those presenting in the clinic were older than those undergoing appendicectomy and had experienced more long lasting interpersonal difficulties. Many had psychiatric illness, but for the remainder the stress might either have caused colonic pain directly or led to consultation for abdominal pains that had not previously presented to a gastroenterologist.\r"

Acute hypertension was induced by infusions of angiotensin performed 1) during the control period, 2) after propranolol (1.5 mg/kg), 3) after atropine (0.2 mg/kg), and 4) after propranolol plus atropine. Absolute and percent variations of mean diameter were correlated to pressure in the control period and after autonomic blockade (p less than 0.01). The slopes of these correlations were not different between propranolol and control groups, but were lower with atropine (p less than 0.01) and with atropine plus propranolol (p less than 0.001) than in the control period. Correlations were also found between Peterson and incremental elastic moduli and mean pressure in the control period and after blockade (p less than 0.001). No differences of slopes existed between propranolol and control groups, but the slope of the correlation relative to the incremental elastic modulus was higher with atropine than in the control period (p less than 0.05), and the slopes of the correlations relative to the Peterson and the incremental elastic moduli were respectively higher with atropine plus propranolol than in the control period (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.05). Thus, atropine decreased the distention and increased the stiffness of the aorta in response to acute angiotensin-mediated hypertension.\r"

We studied the effect of a tumor-promoting phorbol ester, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate 20-acetate (DPBA), on contraction of caudal artery rings of Wistar-Kyoto control (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in order to examine whether protein kinase C-mediated mechanisms are increased in SHR. Although DPBA alone did not produce contractions of either WKY or SHR caudal artery rings, it greatly potentiated the contractions evoked by norepinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, potassium, and calcium ionophore A23187. The potentiation of contractile response to these agents by DPBA was dependent on extracellular calcium. The DPBA potentiation of contractions evoked by norepinephrine, vasopressin, and potassium was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) in SHR than in WKY, while no differences were observed between strains for the contractions evoked by calcium ionophore A23187. These results indicate that the protein kinase C-mediated responses are increased in SHR caudal artery rings, and this effect appears to be due to increased calcium influx through cell membrane calcium channels.\r"

Neonatal sympathectomy of SHRSP with anti-nerve growth factor and guanethidine was also carried out to study the effect of sympathectomy on the distribution of these nerves. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide nerve density was higher in the veins and superior mesenteric artery of SHRSP than of WKY and lower in the cerebral arteries of SHRSP than of WKY, but no difference was found in the muscular mesenteric arteries. Sympathectomy reduced the density of these nerves in all the peripheral vessels but had little effect on the cerebral arteries. Density of substance P nerves was similar between SHRSP and WKY in the peripheral vessels but higher in the cerebral arteries of WKY than of SHRSP. Sympathectomy reduced the density of these nerves in the peripheral vessels but increased the density in some cerebral arteries of SHRSP. Neuropeptide Y nerve density was higher in the peripheral blood vessels of SHRSP than of WKY, and no difference was found in the cerebral arteries. Sympathectomy almost completely removed these nerves in the peripheral vessels but had no effect on the cerebral arteries. We suggest that some of the differences in nerve density between SHRSP and WKY, especially those in the peripheral blood vessels, may be related to the development of hypertension in the SHRSP.\r"

Using whole-nerve recording, the extent (%) of resetting (or reversal of resetting) observed 15 minutes after a maintained fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was evaluated by the ratio between changes of systolic threshold pressure for baroreceptor activation and changes of control diastolic pressure exhibited by the rats, multiplied by 100. Three groups of normotensive control rats showed a MAP decrease to hypotensive levels of 33%, 39%, and 41%, respectively, with sodium nitroprusside, verapamil, and hemorrhage. The corresponding extent of resetting was 96 +/- 3%, 39 +/- 2%, and 46 +/- 4%, respectively. Only in the group treated with verapamil did MAP and systolic threshold pressure not revert completely to normotensive levels 15 minutes after the end of drug infusion. Three groups of one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats showed MAP normalization of 30%, 37%, and 31%, respectively, with sodium nitroprusside, verapamil, and hemorrhage. The corresponding extent of reversal of resetting to normotension was 107 +/- 3%, 40 +/- 2%, and 60 +/- 9%, respectively. Again, only in the group treated with verapamil did MAP and systolic threshold pressure not revert to hypertensive levels 15 minutes after infusion. Besides indicating that different vasodilators can differently modulate the rapid (15-minute) resetting (or reversal of the resetting) due to similarly maintained fall in MAP, these data suggest that verapamil has a nonspecific effect on the baroreceptors, whereas sodium nitroprusside appears to affect baroreceptor transduction.\r"

  ".W": "The site of action for the pressor response to bradykinin administered into the lateral ventricle has been reported to be either in the septal area or in the ventral portion of the third ventricle. We obtained dose-response curves for the pressor effect of bradykinin injected into the lateral ventricle or the posterior region of the fourth ventricle of normotensive Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Responses to fourth ventricle injections had a shorter latency and larger maximal effect, and were 20 to 100 times greater than those to lateral ventricle injections, suggesting that the site of bradykinin's action is in the caudal region of the brain, probably close to the area postrema. Maximal effects were similar for lateral and fourth ventricle injections in both SHR and normotensive rats, but SHR were much more sensitive to bradykinin. The ED50 values for the lateral ventricle route in normotensive rats and SHR were 1.3 and 0.35 nmol, respectively, and, for the fourth ventricle route, 60 and 3.4 pmol, respectively. Responses to Lys-Lys-bradykinin, a kininase-resistant bradykinin analogue, showed that kininase activity is lower in SHR than in normotensive rats and that SHR are four times more sensitive to Lys-Lys-bradykinin than are normotensive rats. The responses of all rats were inhibited by a specific bradykinin receptor blocker [Thi5,8,DPhe7]bradykinin. Our results show that there is a site of bradykinin action that is far more caudal than those previously described. The shorter latency and higher sensitivity of the fourth ventricle injection suggest that bradykinin injected into the lateral ventricle diffuses to the fourth ventricle where it exerts its effects.\r"

The DNA content, wet weight, and dry defatted weight of the adventitia were half that of the intima-media. Collagen was the main component of the adventitia (collagen greater than nonfibrous protein greater than elastin) whereas elastin was the main protein in the intima-media (elastin greater than nonfibrous protein greater than collagen), and the results correlated with morphological observations. Hypertension induced by aortic ligation between the renal arteries resulted in rapid elevations in circulating humoral factors and blood pressure. A sixfold increase in DNA synthesis was observed in the adventitia (p less than 0.001), resulting in a significant increase in DNA content as early as 6 days after aortic ligation (75% increase; p less than 0.001). Increased DNA replication was accompanied by elevations in nonfibrous protein and elastin contents. Autoradiograms showed labeled adventitial fibroblasts throughout the thickness of the adventitia and along the entire length of the aorta and smaller vessels. DNA synthesis and content and labeled smooth muscle cells were increased in the intima-media. These studies indicate that the adventitia participates in the development of vascular hypertrophy and arterial disease produced by aortic ligation.\r"

  ".W": "These studies evaluated the role of the nucleus ambiguus in regulating heart rate and cardiovascular activity. Three days after lesion of the nucleus ambiguus, arterial pressure and heart rate were unchanged; however, subsequent sinoaortic deafferentation produced a significantly greater increase of pressure (156 +/- 4 vs 124 +/- 6 mm Hg) compared to sham lesion. In both groups the heart rate was increased after deafferentation and the intrinsic heart rate (rate seen after autonomic blockade with atropine and propranolol) was significantly reduced. When the sequence was reversed (deafferentation before lesion), pressure (126 +/- 6 vs 126 +/- 7 mm Hg) and heart rate (334 +/- 17 and 340 +/- 16 beats/min) were not altered; however, intrinsic rate fell more. When the nucleus ambiguus was stimulated electrically, two responses emerged: increased pressure without rate changes and increased pressure with bradycardia. These data indicate that 1) lesion of the nucleus ambiguus facilitates hypertension produced by sinoaortic deafferentation unless lesioning follows deafferentation; and 2) stimulation of the nucleus ambiguus produces a pressor effect that is independent of the bradycardic response. We conclude that the nucleus ambiguus may be related to autonomic control of both heart rate and arterial pressure.\r"

An association of Ang II binding sites with both afferent and efferent vagal fibers is consistent with actions of the peptide on cardiac vagal tone and the baroreceptor reflex. To investigate possible transport of Ang II binding sites, quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography was used to visualize binding after double ligation of the peripheral process of the cervical vagus nerve. One ligature was tied 0.2 to 0.5 cm distal to the nodose ganglion; the second ligature was tied on the same nerve 1.0 to 1.5 cm from the nodose ganglion. Twenty-four hours later, high-affinity Ang II binding sites (Ka = 0.46 +/- 0.08 nM) accumulated at the first ligature (the side nearest the nodose ganglion), indicating anterograde transport. Since accumulations of similar affinity sites were seen distal to the second ligature, retrograde transport of binding sites also occurred. These data reveal the existence of a mechanism for the bidirectional axonal transport of Ang II binding sites in the cervical portion of the vagus nerve.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that angiotensin II is released from neuronal tissue in vitro, but the occurrence of this phenomenon in the intact brain has not yet been demonstrated. To characterize the in vivo release of immunoreactive angiotensin II, push-pull cannulas were positioned in the anterior hypothalamus in 47 Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) anesthetized with Inactin (100 mg/kg i.p.). Artificial cerebrospinal fluid was perfused at 20 microliters/min, and effluent samples were collected for 15-minute periods over 2 hours. Angiotensin II was detectable (greater than 2.5 pg/ml) in the push-pull cannula perfusate of the majority (76%) of the rats. Spontaneous release of immunoreactive angiotensin II was constant for 2 hours in 11 rats at values averaging from 4.4 +/- 1.5 to 8.2 +/- 2.2 pg/ml. In addition, bilateral nephrectomy performed 48 hours before did not affect the detection of angiotensin II (n = 3). Angiotensin immunoreactivity in the rat hypothalamus was further characterized by high performance liquid chromatography. The analysis showed that the perfusate contained authentic angiotensin II as well as other angiotensin metabolites. The effect of beta-adrenergic modulation on the release of angiotensin II was assessed in 20 rats by adding isoproterenol (10(-10), 10(-8), and 10(-6) M), propranolol (10(-6) M), or a combination of both. Neither activation nor inhibition of hypothalamic beta-receptors altered the spontaneous release of angiotensin II. These data demonstrate that angiotensin II and congener peptides are detectable in the microenvironment of the anterior hypothalamus of the anesthetized rat and that the release of angiotensin II immunoreactivity in the anterior hypothalamus is not modified by beta-adrenergic receptors.\r"

Reflex changes in heart rate were elicited by bolus intravenous injections of either phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside before and after bilateral microinjection of [Sar1, Thr8]Ang II (100 pmol) or vehicle into the NTS. The slope of the relationship between the change in pulse interval and the change in mean arterial pressure was used as an index of baroreceptor reflex sensitivity. Bradycardia elicited by phenylephrine-induced increases in pressure was significantly greater after NTS injection of [Sar1, Thr8]Ang II. The slope of the pulse interval-arterial pressure relationship was 0.60 +/- 0.09 ms/mm Hg after injection, as compared with 0.42 +/- 0.07 ms/mm Hg before. In contrast, the baroreceptor reflex sensitivity index generated by decreases in pressure with nitroprusside was similar before and after injection. Vehicle injections did not alter the baroreceptor reflex index. Collectively, the data suggest that inhibition of endogenous Ang II in the NTS facilitates the baroreceptor reflex sensitivity to increases, but not decreases, in pressure. This new finding reveals the NTS as one site of action for the tonic effects of endogenous Ang II.\r"

Because hypertension could be produced in these dogs without salt loading and unilateral nephrectomy, the research afforded a novel opportunity to determine the primary effects of DOC excess on the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems, and on vasopressin levels. Both before and during 28 days of DOC treatment, regular measurements of mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance were coupled with serial determinations of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of angiotensin II, vasopressin, norepinephrine, and electrolytes. DOC induced a progressive rise in mean arterial pressure associated with increased cardiac output and no change in heart rate. These hemodynamic changes were accompanied by sustained decreases in plasma renin activity, and in plasma, but not cerebrospinal fluid, angiotensin II. In contrast, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid vasopressin rose transiently on the 7th and 14th days of the study, respectively. After anesthesia with morphine and chloralose, the hemodynamic response to occlusion of a sole innervated carotid artery was evaluated on the 5th week before and after cervical vagotomy. Compared to normal animals, dogs with DOC-induced hypertension showed a reduced pressor response to carotid occlusion associated with suppression of reflex tachycardia; vagotomy partially restored the pressor response to normal levels. The data suggest that DOC-induced hypertension changes central hormonal influences of cardiovascular function, and also alters cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex control of peripheral sympathetic nerve activity.\r"

Short-term (6 hours) and long-term (2, 14, and 30 days) lesions greatly depressed the pressor responses to 60 seconds of common carotid occlusion. The initial peak, which depends on carotid innervation, was reduced by 55% (from 42 +/- 2 to 20 +/- 2 mm Hg), and the maintained response, which is of central origin (probably ischemic), was reduced by 32% (from 31 +/- 2 to 21 +/- 2 mm Hg). The effect of carotid or aortic denervation (or both) was also studied on control and lesioned rats. Carotid denervation produced similar extent of depression of the normal and reduced responses of the AV3V-lesioned rats 35% and 37%, respectively. Aortic denervation produced similar relative potentiation of the responses to common carotid occlusion of control and lesioned rats (72% and 66%, respectively). These data indicate the following: 1) Both short-term and long-term lesions greatly reduce the reflex and central (ischemic) components of the pressor responses to common carotid occlusion in freely moving rats; and 2) the importance of carotid innervation for development of the initial peak and the marked inhibitory effect of the aortic baroreceptor on both components are unchanged after AV3V lesion, when the depressed responses are evaluated as percent changes of the control values rather than as absolute changes.\r"

After female Wistar rats were anesthetized, the femoral artery (for blood pressure measurement) and vein (for parenteral injection of drugs) were cannulated. An intrathecal catheter was positioned with the tip at the T6-L3 intervertebral space. The results showed that the dose-dependent decrease in mean blood pressure induced by serotonin administered at the T6-L3 level was prevented by giving the serotonergic S2 antagonist ritanserin intravenously. The intravenous administration of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, a direct serotonergic agonist, induced a dose-dependent hypotension previously shown to originate at spinal cord level. This effect was prevented by intrathecal administration of ketanserin, an S2-receptor antagonist. The selective agonist of the S1-type receptors, 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin, given at the same level of the spinal cord, failed to induce any effect on mean blood pressure. The results suggest that the hypotensive effect obtained after the spinal serotonergic activation involves serotonin receptors of the S2 type.\r"

  ".W": "During preliminary studies of the rostral ventrolateral medulla as a relay site for responses activated from forebrain, loss of the marked depressor effect of lidocaine, microinjected into lateral rostral ventrolateral medulla, was observed when rats were ventilated spontaneously rather than by artificial ventilation. The mechanism of this effect was studied in rats ventilated at a tidal volume of 2.5 ml. Bilateral injection of 4% lidocaine into lateral rostral ventrolateral medulla decreased mean arterial pressure by -47 +/- 8 mm Hg and heart rate by -68 +/- 21 beats/min. Reduction of tidal volume to 1.5 ml significantly attenuated the fall in mean arterial pressure and heart rate produced by lidocaine to -17 +/- 11 mm Hg and -12 +/- 8 beats/min. The decrease in tidal volume resulted in decreased arterial PO2 and pH, and increased PCO2. However, the depressor effect of lidocaine was not significantly affected by independently changing PO2 and PCO2. The physical stimuli associated with reduction of tidal volume (i.e., changes in lung inflation and chest wall movement) appeared to mediate the attenuated depressor response to the injection of lidocaine into the lateral rostral ventrolateral medulla. These data suggest that 1) tonic vasomotor activity derived from lateral rostral ventrolateral medulla is strongly influenced by altered mechanics of respiration, and 2) the anatomical location of the putative vasomotor center may not be defined by the lateral rostral ventrolateral medulla under all conditions.\r"

We also analyzed the relationship between the serotonergic and renin-angiotensin systems. Blood pressure was determined before and after intracisternal administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, 200 micrograms in saline with 1 mg/ml ascorbic acid (n = 9). Control rats (n = 8) received intracisternal vehicle. Before sacrifice, blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples were obtained. The brain was dissected in several areas. Serotonin, norepinephrine, angiotensinogen, and reninlike concentrations were determined in the brain parenchyma; angiotensinogen concentration was evaluated in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma samples; plasma renin activity was also measured. Treatment produced a significant decrease in blood pressure (-10 mm Hg; p less than 0.025) and, simultaneously, a high depletion of serotonin stores in the studied central areas (p less than 0.001), except in the cerebral cortex. Reninlike concentration was increased in the medulla oblongata (p less than 0.005) and the brainstem (p less than 0.02) after 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine treatment. Angiotensinogen concentration was decreased in the hypothalamus and elevated in the spinal cord. Angiotensinogen concentration in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma angiotensinogen concentration, and plasma renin activity did not change with treatment. Serotonin concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid remained unchanged, while the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid level was diminished (-47%; p less than 0.001). Intracisternal administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine produced a hypotensive effect in normal rats and several modifications of the renin-angiotensin complex, suggesting a relationship between the monoaminergic and peptidergic systems.\r"

A baseline (initial) survey was conducted on a random sample of the population (greater than or equal to 15 years of age) to assess the problem of hypertension in that community. Subsequently, we extended the program in the same area by taking the blood pressure of as many people as we could, and a health education program on hypertension was developed and implemented. All hypertensive persons were treated. We surveyed about 90% of the adult population (29,640) over a 5-year period. We then conducted a final survey on a second random sample of the population to assess the effect of the program. The response rate to the letter of invitation to visit the hypertension clinic was 50%; 30% of the recall appointments were missed, and the dropout rate was 18.6%. Seventy percent of the hypertensive persons had Stage I disease (PAHO/WHO) with normal electrocardiograms. Before the program, 15.7% of the total number of hypertensive persons surveyed in the area had the disease under good control, and this increased to 31% after the program. Mortality due to cerebrovascular disease was reduced from 11/10,000/yr to 7/10,000/yr, whereas mortality caused by myocardial infarction did not change.\r"

No significant differences were noted between the two control groups. Patients with neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma showed significantly higher levels of free and total norepinephrine than controls (p less than 0.01), and those with pheochromocytoma had higher levels than those with neuroblastoma (p less than 0.01). Although the differences were not statistically significant, free dopamine was higher in both groups of patients than in controls. Total dopamine was significantly higher in patients than in controls (p less than 0.01). A positive correlation was noted between levels of total norepinephrine and total dopamine in controls (r = 0.41, p less than 0.05) and in patients with neuroblastoma (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001). Such a correlation was not found in patients with pheochromocytoma. The total dopamine/total norepinephrine ratio was higher (p less than 0.005) in patients with neuroblastoma than in controls and patients with pheochromocytoma. Patients with pheochromocytoma had significantly lower ratios than the other groups (p less than 0.001). A negative correlation was found between the ratios in the different groups and either systolic (p less than 0.001) or diastolic (p less than 0.001) blood pressure. Our results not only support a role for plasma dopamine in the regulation of blood pressure but also suggest that, regardless of the actual levels of both catecholamines, a balance has to be achieved in order to maintain normal blood pressure levels.\r"

All were severely hypertensive despite receiving three or more antihypertensive agents, including conventional doses of diuretics, sympatholytics, and vasodilators. Hypervolemia (24 patients) or normovolemia (2 patients) despite severe diastolic hypertension was the hallmark in 26 patients. Adequate salt and water depletion alone with spironolactone (200 mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide (50-100 ng/day) reduced arterial pressure in all. Twenty-two patients had surgical removal of a solitary adenoma. Over 1 to 2 years of follow-up, 13 were normotensive without medication, and six required hydrochlorothiazide and three hydrochlorothiazide plus a beta-blocker to normalize blood pressure. Blood pressure response to surgery had no relation to either duration or severity of hypertension. Six patients (three with hyperplasia, three with adenoma) have continued diuretic therapy and are normokalemic and normotensive. These results indicate that primary aldosteronism can be associated with sever and drug-resistant hypertension, that maintained hypervolemia is the reason for resistance to therapy, that sustained volume depletion is the most important therapeutic goal for these patients, and that cure can be achieved despite prolonged and severe hypertension.\r"

Patients with (n = 6) or without (n = 10) evidence of autonomic insufficiency had blood pressure and heart rate monitored before and after receiving an intravenous injection of 0.5 mg of a V1 vasopressin inhibitor. None of the patients had supine changes in blood pressure or heart rate. However, upon assuming the erect position, the six patients with preexisting orthostatic hypotension had an average blood pressure fall of 44 mm Hg after vasopressin inhibition (as opposed to 20 mm Hg before), accompanied by a modest rise in heart rate of 20 beats/min. Those without autonomic dysfunction were separated into two subgroups. Four developed an average fall in orthostatic blood pressure of 18 mm Hg after vasopressin inhibition, whereas the remaining six had no change. There were no distinguishing hormonal characteristics (vasopressin, renin, and catecholamine levels) between the groups, but in the patients with autonomic dysfunction, the renin level failed to rise when upright. We conclude that vasopressin plays an important role in preventing or minimizing orthostatic hypotension in diabetic patients. Its pressor contribution is crucial in those with autonomic insufficiency and impaired renin and sympathetic responses, in whom the pressor effectiveness of vasopressin is greatly enhanced.\r"

  ".W": "Data from conscious rats, dogs, and humans show that plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) begins to exert vasoconstrictor activity at concentrations in the same range as those associated with maximum antidiuretic activity. Minimum pressor responses are observed with elevated plasma AVP, due in part to decreases of cardiac output and in part to withdrawal of sympathetic neural tone to various regions of the systemic circulation. These responses appear to some extent to be species-dependent. In conscious dogs, but not in rats, the fall of cardiac output is mediated by AVP stimulation of baroreceptor reflex pathways. Studies in rats indicate that AVP inhibits the sympathetic nervous system by direct action on the central nervous system. No evidence was found for inhibition at peripheral sites such as autonomic ganglia or vascular smooth muscle receptors. Also, AVP plays an important role in the regulation of arterial pressure with blood loss by direct vasoconstriction and by AVP enhancement of the strength of the baroreceptor reflex responses. The role of AVP in the long-term control of arterial pressure and in hypertension remains controversial, but plasma AVP is elevated in many experimental and human forms of hypertension. The link between plasma AVP and hypertension remains unclear because long-term elevation of AVP alone cannot sustain volume expansion or hypertension, and excess AVP does not enhance hypertension produced by sodium-retaining hormones or other vasoconstrictor agents. It appears that AVP plays mainly a permissive role by its fluid-retaining effects in most forms of hypertension. It is also possible that it acts as a central nervous system neural transmitter and modifies autonomic pathways in some forms of hypertension.\r"

To test this assumption, we studied glomerular hemodynamic responses to glycine infusion in rats with reduced renal mass, with and without Goldblatt hypertension. The left kidney was ablated by two thirds in 12 rats, and in 5, hypertension was induced by clipping the right renal artery. Seven normal, unmanipulated rats served as controls. Micropuncture was performed in the left kidney during control and 15% glycine infusion periods, 45 days after surgery. Arterial pressure was higher in hypertensive rats (160.3 mm Hg) than in controls (103.8 mm Hg) and rats with renal ablation (125 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). Higher values of single-nephron glomerular filtration rate and single-nephron plasma flow in rats with renal ablation (63.0, 223.7 nl/min) and hypertension (46.1, 239.7 nl/min) than in controls (28.8, 94.9; p less than 0.05) demonstrated the presence of hyperfiltration. However, glomerular pressure was elevated only in hypertensive rats (40.1 mm Hg), when compared to controls (32.7 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) and rats with renal ablation (33.4 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). Glycine increased single-nephron glomerular filtration rate and single-nephron plasma flow in control rats by 76 and 65%; rats with renal ablation had only partial responses, 35% and 23%, respectively, whereas in hypertensive rats the response was completely abolished. Glycine detected hyperfiltration and unmasked a dysfunction of preglomerular vessels that was greater in hypertensive rats and could contribute to the rise in glomerular pressure and flow and thereby to glomerular damage.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) produces a positive inotropic effect on the heart; however, its usefulness as an inotropic agent is limited because of its inherent vasoconstrictor action. We therefore designed Ang II analogues that are potent, positive inotropic agents with minimal myotropic properties. Replacement of the proline residue in position 7 with alanine reduced the pressor and vascular contractile response to less than 1% of Ang II. In spite of negligible vascular actions, however, [7-alanine]Ang II produced 50% of the inotropic activity of Ang II in the cat papillary muscle. The results of pharmacological evaluation of various position 7-substituted analogues were as follows: 1) Replacement of proline in position 7 of angiotensin I (Ang I) and Ang II with primary amino acids produced cardiac-specific, positive inotropic properties. 2) The selectivity of positive cardiac inotropic activity of position 7-substituted analogues of Ang II was dependent upon the nature of the amino acid in position 1. Replacement of aspartic acid in position 1 with sarcosine increased vasoconstrictor activity, thereby diminishing cardiac selectivity. However, this change did not affect cardiac selectivity in Ang I analogues. 3) Introduction of any type of steric hindrance in position 7 (e.g., replacement of alanine with N-methyl- or alpha-methylalanine) led to a considerable loss in inotropic activity. In conclusion, contrary to rigid, structural requirements (solution conformation) for the pressor action of Ang II, a less organized structure or a random conformation at the carboxyl terminus appears to favor cardiac-selective contractile response (or positive inotropic response).\r"

To test this view, we investigated the effects of vasopressin, Ang II, norepinephrine, and the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP on mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate with and without ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium and angiotensin I (Ang I) converting enzyme inhibition with MK 421 in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats made hypertensive by treatment with dexamethasone (1.8 mg/kg/wk for 14 days). Administration of vasopressin, Ang II, or norepinephrine (0.003-3 microgram i.v.) produced a dose-related increase in arterial blood pressure. The pressor response to vasopressin, but not to Ang II or norepinephrine, was greater in dexamethasone-treated than in vehicle-treated animals, and this difference became more pronounced in rats that received hexamethonium and MK 421. Administration of the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP significantly reduced arterial pressure in dexamethasone-treated but not in vehicle-treated animals. Hexamethonium and MK 421 reduced arterial blood pressure in dexamethasone-treated as well as in vehicle-treated rats; however, arterial blood pressure remained higher in the former. Administration of the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist produced a greater reduction in arterial blood pressure in dexamethasone-treated than in vehicle-treated rats. These data suggest that vasopressin contributes to glucocorticoid-induced hypertension, which is probably due to enhanced vascular reactivity to the peptide.\r"

In the stop-flow pattern for kininase II, three peaks (a, b, and c) were observed.

Peak c, located 2.6 +/- 0.4 ml (p less than 0.01) proximal to the p-aminohippurate peak, was observed in five dogs. Peak b appeared in five dogs and was always located 2.0 ml distal to the minimum sodium concentration. This peak was coincident with the potassium peak. Only two of eight experiments showed all three peaks. These results showed that the major kininase II entry into the tubular fluid is near the p-aminohippurate peak and that distal entry occurred in 63% of the dogs.\r"

Renal plasma flow increased during fenoldopam at 5 hours, 505 +/- 47 ml/min compared with a vehicle control value of 397 +/- 25 ml/min (p less than 0.01), and was sustained for 24 hours, 523 +/- 40 ml/min compared with 432 +/- 31 ml/min (p less than 0.05). The distal sodium load increased and the percentage of distal sodium reabsorption decreased during fenoldopam. Glomerular filtration rate, blood pressure, heart rate, plasma aldosterone concentration, plasma renin activity, and fractional excretion of potassium were unchanged.

  ".W": "To determine whether the central vasopressinergic system at the level of nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) modulates the reflex control of heart rate, we employed a new method for microinjection into the brainstem of conscious, freely moving rats. Baroreceptor reflex function was assessed during pressure changes induced by intravenous administration of phenylephrine (0.25-8 micrograms/kg) and sodium nitroprusside (0.5-16 micrograms/kg) in rats microinjected, through a permanent cannula into the brainstem, with saline, arginine vasopressin (AVP), or an AVP blocker. Baseline levels of pressure and heart rate were not changed by either peptide pretreatment. Restricted injection of AVP (20 ng-0.2 microliter) into the NTS attenuated the reflex bradycardia during pressure increases, with an upward displacement of the baroreceptor reflex function line (p less than 0.01) without change in the sensitivity. Local blockade of endogenous AVP, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP (1 microgram-0.2 microliter), depressed baroreceptor reflex sensitivity with intense bradycardia to either small or large pressure increases. Baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate in response to decreases in pressure was preserved during pretreatment with AVP, whereas endogenous blockade of AVP increased baroreceptor reflex sensitivity. These effects were specific to the NTS, since in another four rats there were no effects when the injections were made 1 mm above, into the cerebellum. The changes in baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate in conscious, unrestrained rats caused by administration of AVP and its endogenous blockade provide evidence that central vasopressinergic synapses at the NTS are important physiological modulators of baroreceptor reflex function.\r"

Intracerebroventricular injection of leumorphin (60 or 600 pmol) significantly inhibited basal vasopressin secretion. The vasopressin response induced by intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin II (100 pmol) was significantly suppressed, in a dose-dependent fashion, by the simultaneous intracerebroventricular injection of leumorphin (6, 60, or 600 pmol). Intravenous pretreatment with naloxone (0.5 mg/kg body weight) diminished the inhibitory action of leumorphin (60 pmol) on vasopressin secretion. Moreover, naloxone (0.5 mg/kg body weight) prolonged the vasopressin secretion induced by intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin II (100 pmol). These results indicate that leumorphin possesses a potent inhibitory effect on vasopressin secretion and that, alone or in combination with other endogenous opioid peptides, it plays an important role in the control of vasopressin secretion.\r"

Kinins can induce the release of vasoactive substances such as catecholamines, renin, vasopressin, histamine, and prostaglandins. To determine whether the blood pressure changes induced by high doses of kinin antagonist are due to agonistic activity mediated by these vasoactive substances, we studied the effect on blood pressure of a kinin antagonist (DArg0-Hyp3-Thi5,8-DPhe7-bradykinin) administered to control, nephrectomized, and adrenalectomized rats, and to rats treated with vasopressin V1-receptor antagonist, ganglionic and alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (either separately or combined), histamine H1- and H2-receptor blockers, and indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor. Blood pressure changes were monitored on awake, restrained rats. In the control rat, the kinin antagonist injected as a bolus (4 mg/kg) into the ascending aorta produced a transient biphasic blood pressure response, first a pressor effect (delta BP = 7 +/- 1 mm Hg; p less than 0.05), then a depressor effect (delta BP = -20 +/- 6 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). The pressor response to the kinin antagonist was not affected by any of the treatments; however, the depressor effect of the kinin antagonist appeared to be caused by the release of vasodilator prostanoids from the kidney, since it was not observed in the nephrectomized rats or in those treated with indomethacin. The pressor effect induced by the kinin antagonist suggests that kinins may contribute to the regulation of blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Reversal of cardiac hypertrophy has been obtained by treatment with some antihypertensive drugs but has not been achieved consistently with beta blockers. To investigate whether this difference might be explained by the distinct hemodynamic actions of the drugs, we studied the effects of propranolol and pindolol, beta blockers with distinct modes of action, on cardiac hypertrophy of hypertensive male Wistar rats, two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) Goldblatt model (n = 33) and sham-operated control rats (n = 34). We also assessed the effects of such therapies on the ventricular pumping ability during open-chest, transient aortic occlusion. Four weeks after surgery, propranolol (5 mg/kg/day p.o.) was given to hypertensive (n = 8) and control rats (n = 11); pindolol was also given orally (1 mg/kg/day) to similar groups (n = 7 and n = 5, respectively). Untreated animals served as controls for both groups. Cardiac hypertrophy developed with hypertension in the untreated rats of the propranolol (3.38 +/- 0.18 vs 2.60 +/- 0.08 mg/g; p less than 0.01) and pindolol groups (3.93 +/- 0.21 vs 2.40 +/- 0.03 mg/g; p less than 0.001). Treatment reversed cardiac hypertrophy in the pindolol-treated (3.01 +/- 0.19 vs 3.93 +/- 0.21 mg/g; p less than 0.001, NS) but not in the propranolol-treated rats (3.24 +/- 0.18 vs 3.38 +/- 0.21 mg/g, NS). The maximal pressure that developed during aortic occlusion in the propranolol group was similar to that observed in the pindolol group. These results indicate that cardiac hypertrophy is reversed by pindolol but not by propranolol, and that this reversal does not interfere with left ventricular pumping ability.\r"

A significant increase (p less than 0.01) in the left ventricular weight/body weight ratio was observed in male but not in female rats 15 days after operation, compared to age- and sex-matched sham-operated rats. This differential hypertrophy occurred despite the development of a significant elevation in arterial blood pressure in both sexes. Castration prior to sinoaortic denervation did not change the level of arterial hypertension but caused a significant reduction (p less than 0.01) in left ventricular weight in male rats and a significant increase (p less than 0.01) in female rats. The pretreatment of male and female sinoaortic denervated and castrated rats with testosterone resulted in ventricular hypertrophy similar to that observed in intact male sinoaortic denervated rats. Pretreatment with estradiol, however, suppressed the left ventricular hypertrophy in intact male rats but did not change the normal ventricular mass observed in intact female sinoaortic denervated rats. These results indicate that the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in sinoaortic denervated rats is modulated by sex hormones, and that testosterone exerts a facilitatory and estradiol an inhibitory action.\r"

This study is a double-blind assessment of the effect of combined alpha- and beta-blockade (labetalol) and beta-blockade alone (atenolol) on left ventricular filling in mild hypertension. Twenty-seven patients blindly randomized to labetalol (12 patients) and atenolol (15 patients) treatment completed the echocardiographic and Doppler studies. Clinical and echo-Doppler data obtained at baseline and 6 weeks after initiation of therapy showed no difference between the two groups for age (49 +/- 10 vs 46 +/- 10 years), mean blood pressure (before therapy, 118 +/- 9 vs 117 +/- 8 mm Hg; after therapy, 108 +/- 12 mm Hg), left ventricular dimensions, wall thickness, systolic function, and mean late filling velocity A. There was no significant change in left ventricular mass and mass index with labetalol (left ventricular mass, 211 +/- 36 vs 216 +/- 38; mass index, 110 +/- 17 vs 112 +/- 16) or atenolol (245 +/- 41 vs 271 +/- 65; 120 +/- 18 vs 130 +/- 35). The mean velocity E, A/E, and A/E/Age ratios significantly improved with labetalol (p less than 0.05) but did not change significantly with atenolol. The improvement in A/E and A/E/Age ratios was primarily due to an increase in early filling velocity E.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The development of equinus deformity was found to occur more often in patients who had the procedure at a younger age and in patients in whom the calcaneotibial angle measured more than 70 degrees at the time of the tenodesis. Residual cavovarus deformity was successfully treated by a plantar release.\r"

The modification includes the utilization of a T-shaped skin incision with large flaps, and osteotomies of the iliac crest, greater trochanter, and anterior superior iliac spine. The iliotibial band is transected and the abductor muscle mass is rotated posteriorly, hinged on the superior gluteal neurovascular bundle. Twenty patients had open reduction and internal fixation of a complex acetabular fracture using this surgical approach. Excellent surgical exposure allowed good or excellent reduction of the acetabulum in all patients. No flap necrosis developed, and all fractures healed. One non-union of a trochanteric osteotomy needed revision. This approach provides increased exposure of the posterior column and visualization of the entire surface of the joint and it allows fixation of the fracture from both sides of the iliac wing. The T-shaped skin incision allows utilization of a standard posterior approach with conversion to the extensile exposure if necessary. Options for late reconstruction are not compromised. Lagscrew fixation of the osteotomies allows aggressive rehabilitation of the joint.\r"

Clinical hip-rating scores, as described by Harris, were determined and anteroposterior and frog-leg lateral radiographs were made preoperatively, shortly postoperatively, and at three months, six months, one year, and two years postoperatively. The mean hip-rating score was 92 points (range, (range, 74 to 100 points) at one year and 92 points (range, 69 to 100 points) at two years. The thigh was slightly painful in nine patients (18 per cent) at one year and in eight (16 per cent) at two years. Fourteen hips (28 per cent) (in thirteen patients) caused a moderate or severe limp two years postoperatively; however, this complication appears to have been related more to the direct lateral approach that was used than to the prosthesis. Six (13 per cent) of the patients walked with a cane at one year and five (11 per cent) still required a cane at two years. Serial radiographic evaluations revealed that, between the first and second postoperative years, a progressive radiodense femoral line developed in twenty hips (41 per cent); a progressive acetabular line, in four hips (8 per cent); and progressive femoral sclerosis, in twelve hips (24 per cent). There was progressive loosening of beads from twelve (24 per cent) of the femoral components and from nine (18 per cent) of the acetabular components. The position of one acetabular and one femoral component changed. Two femoral shafts fractured, one intraoperatively and one fourteen months postoperatively. We concluded that the clinical results were encouraging in these patients at the end of two years. We are concerned, however, about the progressive radiodense lines, sclerosis, and loosening of beads as well as the slight, but persistent, pain in the thigh in eight patients.\r"

  ".W": "In order to study how the efficiency of the halo vest is affected by different lengths of the vest, an experimental headband was devised that allowed the head of a normal person to be held securely in the halo attachment. The vest was then modified to allow it to be adjusted to three different lengths (Fig. 2): a full vest extended to the iliac crests, a short vest extended to the twelfth ribs, and a half vest extended to the level of the nipples. Twenty normal, healthy adult men participated in the study. For each vest length, radiographs were made of each subject demonstrating rotation, flexion-extension, and lateral bending of the cervical spine. There was no rotation of the cervical spine, regardless of the length of the vest. There was a variable degree of motion in flexion or extension of the upper part of the cervical spine with all vest lengths, but this was not statistically significant. There was definite increase of motion caudad to the level of the fifth cervical vertebra regardless of the length of the vest. We concluded that a lesion of the upper part of the cervical spine can be treated effectively by halo traction with a half vest. This will improve the comfort and care of the patient and avoid the necessity of removing the vest if emergency cardiovascular resuscitation is needed. In the treatment of lesions of the lower part of the cervical spine (caudad to the level of the fourth cervical vertebra), the use of a halo vest that extends caudad to the level of the twelfth ribs does provide additional stability.\r"

All seventeen patients had severe sciatica. The swelling of the nerve-root elements gradually returned to normal after surgical decompression, which was also associated with improvement of the sciatica. Patients who did not have severe sciatica did not show swollen nerve-root elements. These findings may be an important clue to the mechanism of sciatic pain in patients who have herniation of a lumbar disc.\r"

Two weeks after irradiation, the animals had lost weight and disappearance of bone cells, shrunken osteocytes, and significantly decreased bone-turnover activities were noted. The bone marrow showed reduced hematopoietic elements and sinusoids with increased fat. No change in the torsional strength and geometric properties of bone was noted at this time. Six to ten weeks after irradiation, histopathological abnormalities of the bone persisted, and there was an accelerated resorption process. However, significant increases in the strength and cortical area of bone appeared only in the non-irradiated, contralateral femur. On the irradiated side, decreased cortical area and increased porosity of bone were found at fourteen to eighteen weeks when compared with the control rats. Other histomorphological properties, such as bone porosity, osteocyte count, and periosteal new-bone formation, appeared to recover eighteen weeks after irradiation, as they became similar to the values for the age-matched normal control rats.\r"

There was also a dramatic increase (p less than 0.01) in the number of injuries of the ankle and foot in the athletes who wore braces.

We treated fifteen patients who had this lesion, most of whom had several associated injuries. Three patients died: two from exsanguination and one from a cardiac arrest.

  ".W": "Although a fracture rarely fails to unite in a healthy child, non-union is not a rare occurrence in a child who has osteogenesis imperfecta. We identified twelve non-unions in ten patients from a population of fifty-two patients who had osteogenesis imperfecta. The average age of these patients when the diagnosis of non-union was made nine years, and the average age at the time of treatment was 12.5 years. All of the patients had had a decrease in functional ability as a result of the non-union. There were five femoral, four humeral, one radial, one ulnar, and one pubic non-union. Five of the non-unions were hypertrophic, and seven were atrophic. Eight of the nine ununited fractures that were operated on healed after excision of the non-union, intramedullary nailing, and bone-grafting. Three of the non-unions (in two patients) were not operated on, and the one patient in whom surgery failed had an amputation. Non-union was frequently associated with repeated fractures at a progressively deforming site.\r"

Before treatment started, MRI studies were performed on 10 patients, six of whom were treated conservatively, after which further MRI studies helped to establish a concentric reduction. In the other four conservative treatment failed and they were operated on; in them the MRI studies were compared with arthrographic and surgical findings. In all but one of these 10 patients, MRI enabled us to differentiate between an everted and an inverted limbus. In five other patients with unsatisfactory development of the hip following closed reduction, MRI was compared with earlier arthrographic studies. MRI provided accurate anatomical information which would not have been obtained by arthrography. It clearly has great potential in assisting the surgeon to select the appropriate form of treatment.\r"

Of the 104 slippings diagnosed at follow-up, 25% showed osteoarthritis. It is concluded that, with a slipped epiphysis, prophylactic contralateral pinning should be performed to avoid slipping and to reduce the risk of osteoarthritis.\r"

The pressure was increased considerably by medial rotation and decreased by lateral rotation and especially by semi-flexion. From zero to 36 ml of blood was aspirated; the amount did not correlate with the intracapsular pressure. Of 25 patients who were also examined by scintimetry, 13 had reduced uptake at the femoral head before aspiration, and nine of these showed a marked increase in uptake after aspiration. Intracapsular tamponade of the hip may be one reason for the occasional occurrence of segmental collapse of the femoral head after subcapital fracture with minor displacement.\r"

The incidence of non-union and infection in the sliding screw-plate group was significantly higher, and we believe that when internal fixation is considered appropriate multiple pinning should be used. Mobility after treatment was disappointing in about half of the patients, and we feel that internal fixation can only be justified in patients who are physiologically well preserved and who maintain a high level of activity.\r"

Statistical analysis demonstrated significant differences between patients with either left or right hip replacement and between pre- and postoperative testing. Most patients improved by the eighth week, but some had deteriorated and did not recover until re-tested eight months after operation. It is concluded that for most patients eight weeks' delay for return to driving is appropriate, but for a minority of patients with right hip replacement recovery of reaction speed requires longer rehabilitation.\r"

Four other knees (5%) showed signs of probable tibial loosening, but the patients were asymptomatic, the clinical results had not deteriorated with time and lucent lines had not progressed. Varus alignment of the knee and a varus tilt of more than 2 degrees of the tibial component correlated with the incidence of lucent lines around the tibial implant. No patellar stress fractures were seen but impingement symptoms were present in 20%, although they were troublesome in less than half of them.

The survivorship study (based on a definition of failure which included significant pain or a dissatisfied patient or the need for revision) showed a cumulative success rate of 76.4% at six years, with no further failures after that time. Seven knees have been revised, in most cases for deterioration of the contralateral compartment.

First metatarsal shortening was the same after both operations, and the degree of shortening was unrelated to either the clinical or the pedobarographic findings. Although the long-term radiographic changes after the Hohmann osteotomy were more worrying, the pedobarographic patterns tended to be worse after the Wilson osteotomy. There were no poor results and the numbers of feet with the same final grade were identical in each group. However, there was abnormal loading of the lateral metatarsal heads after both osteotomies when compared with the normal foot, and hallux-contact time during the stance phase was also significantly reduced after osteotomy.\r"

The disease shows both general and focal skeletal changes, the latter being mainly in the limbs with an onset from the second decade. Progressive osteoclastic resorption is accompanied by medullary expansion which leads to pain, severe deformity and a tendency to pathological fracture. The serum alkaline phosphatase and urinary hydroxyproline are variably elevated, while other biochemical indices are normal. Most patients had an associated deafness of early onset and loss of dentition. No previous description of this disease has been found in the literature.\r"

Twenty-seven patients underwent Harrington instrumentation, after which lateral indices of curvature were significantly improved, but changes in the transverse plane were less pronounced. Sublaminar wiring was carried out in two patients whose thoracic lordosis was corrected by the surgery. Five patients whose severe deformity had persisted after previous spinal surgery underwent costoplasty, which resulted in a significant improvement in back shape measurements. We conclude that the cosmetic deformity of the back in scoliosis is only partially corrected by operations on the spine itself, whilst costoplasty addresses the problem directly, and improves the surface shape.\r"

We found that both the ligamentum flavum and the laminae at L3-4 level were thicker than in a control group. Decompressive laminectomy at the L3-4 level significantly reduced the area of hypo-aesthesia in the thigh, effecting complete cure in seven of the 11 cases. Meralgia paraesthetica is not uncommon in patients with spinal stenosis and is referable to changes at the L3-4 level. It seems that many cases of meralgia may have a spinal origin.\r"

There was poor agreement on whether trabeculae crossed the fracture line, whether there was sclerosis at or near the fracture and on whether the proximal part of the scaphoid was avascular. As a consequence, agreement on union also was poor; it appears that radiographs taken 12 weeks after a scaphoid fracture do not provide reliable and reproducible evidence of healing.\r"

The mean basal plasma 21-DOF concentrations in each of the 4 groups of normal subjects were between 8 ng/dL (0.23 nmol/L) and 11 ng/dL (0.31 nmol/L), and they increased significantly after ACTH stimulation to between 36 ng/dL (1.04 nmol/L) and 44 ng/dL (1.27 nmol/L). There were no differences in basal or ACTH-stimulated plasma 21-DOF levels in these 4 groups, whereas their basal and post-ACTH plasma 17-OHP levels did vary. Among the LOCAH patients, 83.8% had basal plasma 21-DOF levels and 61.2% had basal plasma 17-OHP levels higher than the highest basal 21-DOF [30 ng/dL (0.86 nmol/L)] and 17-OHP [450 ng/dL (13.61 nmol/L)] concentrations in the normal subjects, and all individual 21-DOF and 17-OHP levels after ACTH stimulation [greater than or equal to 404 ng/dL (11.67 nmol/L) and greater than or equal to 1040 ng/dL (31.47 nmol/L), respectively] were markedly higher than the highest 21-DOF [76 ng/dL (2.19 nmol/L)] and 17-OHP [580 ng/dL (17.55 nmol/L)] levels in the normal subjects. The mean post-ACTH/basal plasma level ratios among the LOCAH patients were 19.75 for 21-DOF and 8.03 for 17-OHP. In LOCAH heterozygotes, basal 21-DOF values were higher than normal in 48.3%, and post-ACTH values were higher than normal in 93.5% of the cases. In contrast, basal plasma 17-OHP levels were similar in LOCAH heterozygotes and normal subjects, and only 16.1% of the LOCAH heterozygotes had post-ACTH plasma 17-OHP levels higher than the highest normal value. If sex and phase of the menstrual cycle are taken into account, along with the incremental responses (post-ACTH minus baseline value) of plasma 21-DOF and 17-OHP, to compare LOCAH heterozygotes and normal subjects, the discriminating power for detection of heterozygocity was somewhat increased for 21-DOF (to 100%) and appreciably increased for 17-OHP (to 30%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We attempted to determine at what plasma concentration AVP can stimulate ACTH release. Six normal men were given infusions of AVP (Ferring) or vehicle between 1600 and 1700 h on five occasions: 1) saline (30 mL/h); 2) 10 ng AVP/min; 3) 30 ng AVP/min; 4) 100 ng AVP/min; and 5) 300 ng AVP/min. Plasma AVP, ACTH, and cortisol concentrations were measured every 10 min during the infusions. Basal plasma AVP levels were less than 1 ng/L (less than 0.92 pmol/L). The lowest AVP dose raised plasma AVP into the range found in fluid-deprived subjects (7-8 ng/L;6.5-7.3 pmol/L), but had no effect on plasma ACTH concentrations. AVP in a dose of 30 ng/min also had no effect. The 100 ng AVP/min dose raised plasma AVP concentrations to 51.4-65.5 ng/L (46-60 pmol/L). This increase led to a transient insignificant increase in plasma ACTH from 13.9 +/- 1.2 (+/- SEM) ng/L (3.1 +/- 0.3 pmol/L) to 20.0 +/- 1.4 ng/L (4.4 +/- 0.3 pmol/L), while plasma cortisol rose significantly from 146 +/- 10 to 209 +/- 19 nmol/L (P less than 0.01) after 60 min of infusion. The 300 ng AVP/min dose raised plasma AVP levels to about 260 ng/L (239 pmol/L); the maximal plasma ACTH and cortisol levels were 39.5 +/- 5.0 ng/L (8.7 +/- 1.1 pmol/L; P less than 0.01) and 348 nmol/L (P less than 0.01), respectively. Thus, peripheral plasma AVP levels have to be raised high above the physiological range before ACTH release is stimulated. We conclude that any AVP reaching the adenohypophysis through the peripheral circulation is of much less importance for the regulation of ACTH secretion than is AVP derived from the pituitary portal circulation.\r"

Besides having elevated serum T4 concentrations, her serum free T4 concentrations were consistently elevated, as measured by three different methods, including equilibrium dialysis and ultrafiltration. Serum total and free T3 concentrations were in the low normal range, and serum 3,5-diiodothyronine (3,5-T2) levels were low, suggesting reduced 5'-deiodination of both T4 and T3. Serum total and free rT3 and total and free 3', 5'-T2 concentrations were all markedly elevated, whereas serum total and free 3,3'-T2 were low, suggesting unaltered 5-deiodination of T4 to rT3 and of rT3 to 3',5'-T2 in combination with reduced 5'-deiodination of rT3 and 3',5'-T2. The girl had a small diffuse goiter, her serum TSH response to TRH was exaggerated, and thyroid radioiodine uptake was elevated, suggesting slightly increased TSH secretion and, consequently, increased thyroid secretion. Both T3 and T4 administration resulted in suppressed basal as well as TRH-stimulated serum TSH concentrations, and radioiodine uptake was suppressed during T3 administration. Our data suggest reduced activity of several (all?) peripheral 5'-deiodination pathways, including possibly also thyrotroph T4 5'-deiodination. Thus, this girl seems to have a previously unrecognized syndrome of generalized 5'-deiodinase deficiency.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the mechanism(s) of the decreased LH secretion in these animals. Neither stress-induced glucocorticoid nor catecholamine release was responsible, since neither blockade of glucocorticoid secretion with the adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitor metyrapone nor blockade of catecholamine secretion with the sympathetic ganglionic blocking drug chlorisondamine prevented the stress-induced decline in serum LH concentrations. Administration of the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone (0.5 mg/kg BW), however, not only prevented the decline, but also transiently elevated serum LH concentrations, suggesting that opiates play a role in tonic as well as stress-induced decreases in LH secretion. Administration of a small dose of naloxone (0.03 mg/kg BW) commensurate with occupancy of only mu-opiate receptors slowed the stress-induced decline in LH concentrations, as did administration of the kappa-receptor antagonist MR 1452. These data suggest that opiates inhibit LH release via the combined occupancy of both mu- and kappa-receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Hypercortisolism was found in patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) in preliminary short term studies conducted during the morning hours (0800-1100 h). This observation prompted us to characterize the circadian and pulsatile patterns of serum cortisol and LH levels at 15-min intervals for 24 h in 10 women with functional HA and in 7 normal women during the early follicular phase of their cycles. The mean integrated 24-h serum cortisol levels (area under the curve) were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher in the HA patients than in normal women. The mean cortisol levels in the HA patients were elevated (P less than 0.005) compared to those in the normal women during the daytime hours (0800-1600 h), but not during the evening (1600-2400 h) and sleeping hours (2400-0800 h). This selective hypercortisolism during the waking period of the day was almost entirely related to increased duration and amplitude of secretory episodes (peak area) rather than a change in pulse frequency. The serum cortisol increments in response to a noon meal that occurred in normal women were markedly impaired (P less than 0.01) in the HA patients. Compared with that in the normal women, mean LH pulse frequency was reduced by 30% in the HA patients. The 24-h mean LH levels and mean LH pulse amplitude were not significantly different from those in the normal women. However, among the HA patients there were marked individual differences in LH pulse frequency and amplitude, with prolonged interpulse quiescent periods, indicative of dysfunction of the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator. We conclude that neuroendocrine activation of the ACTH-adrenal axis and inhibition of the GnRH pulse generator in women are associated with HA. Further, spontaneous resumption of normal cyclicity occurred in the majority (8 of 10) of the HA patients with no medical treatment, suggesting that this syndrome is a reversible hypothalamic disorder of a functional nature.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid hormone is one of several factors that modulate the level of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in serum. SHBG levels are usually elevated in thyrotoxicosis and have been reported to be normal in a few patients with generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH). This study was designed to determine whether basal serum SHBG levels or the SHBG response to short term T3 administration could be used as an index of thyroid hormone action and thus serve as a test for the evaluation of patients suspected of having peripheral tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. Serum SHBG, total T4, free T4 index (FT4I), total T3, and TSH levels were measured in 21 normal subjects, 28 hypothyroid patients, 20 thyrotoxic patients, and 10 patients with GRTH. Excluding patients with GRTH, serum basal SHBG values were correlated with FT4I values (r = 0.66; P less than 0.0001). Mean SHBG levels in the patients with GRTH [37.6 +/- 16.2 (+/- SD) nmol/L] were not significantly different from those in the normal subjects (35.1 +/- 19.3 nmol/L) or hypothyroid patients (26.3 +/- 17.1 nmol/L), but were significantly lower than those in the thyrotoxic group (64.7 +/- 19.2 nmol/L; P less than 0.001). All 10 patients with GRTH had basal SHBG values in the normal range, but 7 of 20 (35%) thyrotoxic patients also had normal basal SHBG values. T3 was given orally for three sequential 3-day periods at doses of 50, 100, and 200 micrograms daily to 7 normal subjects, 11 hypothyroid and 3 thyrotoxic patients, and all 10 patients with GRTH. The serum SHBG concentration was measured on the last day at each dosage level. During T3 administration, SHBG levels increased in all individuals with normal tissue responsiveness. The increase above the basal value (delta SHBG) at each T3 dose was similar in normal, hypothyroid, and thyrotoxic individuals (non-resistant subjects). After administration of 50 micrograms T3 daily, the mean delta SHBG level was decreased [-2.9 +/- 5.3 (+/- SD) nmol/L] in the resistant patients and increased (4.0 +/- 4.9 nmol/L; P less than 0.005) in the nonresistant subjects. After administration of 100 micrograms T3 daily, the mean delta SHBG was -4.5 +/- 6.8 nmol/L in the resistant patients and 8.6 +/- 5.1 nmol/L (P less than 0.0001) in the nonresistant subjects. Serum SHBG decreased by more than 2 nmol/L in 6 of 10 (60%) resistant patients, but in no nonresistant subject.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Three members from whom blood could be obtained had supranormal serum testosterone and normal LH and FSH levels. One man had severe oligospermia with decreased motility, and one had normal sperm density and motility. In fibroblasts cultured from genital skin biopsies from two of the men, the levels of androgen receptor and affinity of binding of receptor to dihydrotestosterone were normal. However, androgen binding in fibroblast monolayers was thermolabile, up-regulation of receptor levels did not occur after prolonged incubation of monolayers with dihydrotestosterone or methyltrienolone, and dissociation rates at 37 C were increased with the synthetic androgen mibolerone. In addition, in cytosol preparations the androgen receptor protein was unstable. This disorder probably represents the most subtle functional abnormality of androgen receptor characterized to date, since it is compatible with normal male phenotypic development and in some affected men with fertility. It follows that infertility is not an invariable feature of androgen resistance as we previously suggested.\r"

Thirty-six patients were euthyroid; the mean TIC of the patients (n = 15), who had been treated for less than 12 months was 30 +/- 19 (+/- SD) mg, twice the normal mean value (14.6 +/- 5.0 mg), and it was 39 +/- 17 mg in those (n = 16) who had been treated for 12-60 months and 29 +/- 6 mg in those (n = 5) who had been treated longer (greater than 60 months). Nineteen patients were hyperthyroid and had elevated TIC values. Of them, 6 patients had a goiter; their TIC (50 +/- 19 mg) was not significantly different from that of the hyperthyroid patients with no goiter (55 +/- 29 mg), but they became hyperthyroid more rapidly. Thirteen patients were hypothyroid; none had TIC values above the normal range, and it was below 2.5 mg in 5 patients. A sequential study was undertaken in 11 euthyroid patients who had no detectable antithyroid antibodies. TIC did not increase during treatment in 2 patients; both developed hypothyroidism, which was transient in 1 despite continuation of amiodarone treatment. The TIC initially increased during amiodarone treatment in the other 9 patients, leveling off at the end of the first year. The TIC rose well above the upper limit of the normal range in 4 patients, of whom 2 became hyperthyroid during the second year of treatment. TIC remained within the normal range in the other 5 patients, of whom 3 became hypothyroid after 12-24 months of treatment (1 subclinical, 2 overt). Although the TIC was significantly higher in the patients with hyperthyroidism than in the patients who remained euthyroid, the TIC test cannot be used to predict the occurrence of hyperthyroidism. The latter must be diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and a frank elevation of serum thyroid hormone levels. Conversely, patients whose TIC values do not increase during treatment or remain within the normal range should be considered at risk for hypothyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "Gonadotropin secretion is pulsatile in prepubertal and early pubertal boys, and the onset of puberty is characterized by a sleep-associated rise in LH pulse amplitude. To determine whether an augmentation in LH pulse frequency as well as amplitude occurs at the onset of puberty, we studied gonadotropin secretion in 21 early to midpubertal boys. Blood samples were taken every 20 min (every 15 min in 4 boys) for LH determinations. A 2-fold increase in LH pulse frequency occurred during the nighttime sampling period (2200-0400 h) compared to that in the hours when the boys were awake (1000-2200 h). The maximum frequency (0.7 pulses/h) occurred between 2400 and 0200 h. The mean plasma LH concentration increased during the night from 2.3 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE) mIU/mL (2.3 +/- 0.2 IU/L) between 2000-2200 h to a maximum of 6.2 +/- 0.4 (6.2 +/- 0.4 IU/L) between 0200-0400 h. The mean plasma LH decreased to 5.5 +/- 0.4 mIU/mL (5.5 +/- 0.4 IU/L) between 0400-0600 h and to 4.2 +/- 0.5 (4.2 +/- 0.5 IU/L) between 0600-0800 h. Plasma testosterone rose during the night to a mean maximum value of 2.4 +/- 0.5 (+/- SE) ng/mL (8.3 +/- 1.7 nmol/L). This finding suggested that the rise in testosterone might play a role in decreasing LH secretion during the later hours of sleep (after 0400 h). To address this question and to study further the effects of testosterone in early puberty, we measured plasma LH concentrations every 10 min from 2000-0800 h in 8 early to mid-pubertal boys before and during short term testosterone administration. Saline or testosterone at a concentration of 9.33 micrograms/mL (32 mumol/L) was infused at a rate of 10 mL/h from 2100-1200 h to shift the nighttime testosterone rise 3 h earlier than would occur spontaneously. Blood samples were obtained every 10 min for LH and every 30 min for testosterone determinations from 2000-0800 h. Pituitary responsiveness was assessed by administering sequential doses of synthetic GnRH (25 and 250 ng/kg) at 1000 and 1200 h, respectively. The nighttime increase in LH pulse frequency and mean plasma LH concentration occurred between 2300 and 0200 h despite testosterone infusion. However, testosterone infusion was associated with significantly lower mean plasma LH concentrations from 0200-0800 h compared to those on the night of the saline infusion. Pituitary responsiveness to synthetic GnRH was unaltered by testosterone administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Urinary Sm-C/IGF-I was excreted as the free hormone, since no binding of radiolabeled Sm-C/IGF-I to any urine protein with a mol wt similar to those described for plasma Sm-C/IGF-I-binding proteins was found. The preterm infants excreted significantly more urinary GH [13.5 +/- 2.1 (+/- SE) ng/kg.12 h] than either the fullterm infants (5.3 +/- 1.6 ng/kg.12h) or the children (0.27 +/- 0.02 ng/kg.12 h; P less than 0.01). The mean urinary Sm-C/IGF-I excretion in the preterm infants (98.9 +/- 7.5 mU/kg.12 h) was comparable to that in fullterm infants (87.6 +/- 9.7 mU/kg.12 h); both groups excreted significantly more urinary Sm-C/IGF-I than children (28.4 +/- 2.1 mU/kg.12 h; P less than 0.01). The group differences were similar when the results were expressed in terms of creatinine excretion. Urinary GH excretion correlated positively with urinary Sm-C/IGF-I excretion (r = 0.68). The higher output of these peptides in rapidly growing infants and their positive correlation in urine provide additional support for the Sm hypothesis.\r"

The met-enkephalin was localized in a large subpopulation of TSH immunoreactive cells (thyrotrophs). No other proenkephalin-derived opioid peptides were found in the pituitary, and there was no overlap between proopiomelanocortin and met-enkephalin immunoreactive cells. These results suggest that the human anterior pituitary gland contains a novel met-enkephalin precursor and a possible role for met-enkephalin in regulating human thyroid function.\r"

  ".W": "Exogenous human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) therapy produces transient hyperprolactinemia during ovulation induction or ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization, and hyperprolactinemia has been linked to decreased fertility. Coadministration of clomiphene citrate (CC) with hMG is often used to decrease the total amount of hMG used in such patients, but whether this results in less hyperprolactinemia is not known. As the hyperprolactinemia in this setting is a threshold phenomenon dependent on the strength and duration of estrogen exposure, we investigated whether CC acted as an estrogen to enhance PRL secretion or as an antiestrogen deterring estradiol (E2)- and progesterone (P4)-induced hyperprolactinemia in nonhuman primates. Normally cycling (control) monkeys (n = 4) received E2 benzoate (12.5 micrograms/kg, im, daily) on menstrual cycle days 6-33 and continuous crystalline P4 via Silastic implants on days 20-33, a regimen known to initiate hyperprolactinemia. Treated monkeys (n = 5) received the same regimen, except that oral CC (15 mg daily) was given on days 6-33. Daily serum samples were assayed for E2, P4, and PRL. Both treatments caused significant (P less than 0.05) increases in serum PRL concentrations during P4 administration. The CC-treated monkeys had significantly smaller increases in mean PRL [21 +/- 1.5 (+/- SEM) vs. 44 +/- 6.3 ng/mL (micrograms/L); P less than 0.05] and smaller mean area under the PRL response curve [288 +/- 35 (+/- SEM) vs. 588 +/- 121 ng/day.mL (micrograms/day.L); P less than 0.05] than the control monkeys. We conclude that CC attenuates the hyperprolactinemia response to E2/P4 synergy in monkeys by acting as an antiestrogen. If coadministered with hMG for ovulation induction or ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization, CC should attenuate hMG-induced hyperprolactinemia, thereby reducing its potentially adverse effects on fertility.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured human keratinocytes converted T4 to T3 by type II iodothyronine deiodination. Homogenates of keratinocytes cultured from neonatal foreskin or adult arm skin had similar mean T4 5'-deiodinating activities. Conversion of T4 to T3 by intact cells was demonstrable in cultures from neonatal and adult donors. Only phenolic ring deiodination occurred in the cultured cells and their homogenates, the apparent Michaelis constant for T4 was 12 nmol/L, and T4 and rT3 each inhibited 5'-deiodination of the other. T4 5'-deiodination was unaffected by addition to the assay mixture of 1 mumol/L T3, but was inhibited less than 10% by 1 mmol/L 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil, 50% by 270 nmol/L iopanoic acid, 50% by 9.4 mumol/L 3,5-diiodo- 3',5'-dimethyl-L-thyronine, and 33% by 42 mumol/L amiodarone. When keratinocytes were cultured for 3-4 days in medium containing iodothyronine-free fetal calf serum, the T4 5'-deiodination rates in homogenates doubled; this increase was prevented by restoring a physiological free T4 concentration, but not by a supraphysiological T3 concentration. Homogenates of fresh whole skin or fetal cadaveric epidermis did not convert T4 to T3 in measureable amounts, although one epidermal homogenate had low level T3 typrosyl-ring deiodinating activity. These results suggest that human epidermal type II iodothyronine deiodination in man might conceivably contribute to the intracellular T3 content of the skin and even to serum T3 concentrations, especially in hypothyroidism.\r"

  ".U": "88154045\r", 
  ".W": "We sought to determine if the high phosphorus, moderately low calcium intake typical of U.S. teenagers and young adults alters parathyroid function as it does in experimental animals. Because those animals ultimately developed osteopenia, it has been suggested that low dietary calcium to phosphorus ratios may reduce peak bone mass and increase susceptibility to osteoporotic fracture later in life. However, it is not known whether PTH secretion or action increases in response to commonly consumed phosphorus-rich, calcium-poor foods. We studied the 24-h mineral and hormonal responses of eight men and eight women, aged 18-25 yr, after 8 days of ingesting a control diet that had calcium (820 mg) and phosphorus (930 mg) contents near the recommended daily intakes, and a test diet with calcium and phosphorus contents (1660 mg phosphorus, 420 mg calcium) typical of current intakes. Both diets were made from common grocery store foods. The 24-h mean serum immunoreactive PTH levels increased in men (11%; P less than 0.006) and women (22%; P less than 0.003) during the test diet. In both sexes, the test diet significantly increased serum phosphorus, plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and urinary hydroxyproline and cAMP excretion; in women only it decreased serum ionized and total calcium levels. Thus, short term ingestion of a diet typifying current levels of calcium and phosphorus intake resulted in elevated serum iPTH levels and indexes of PTH action in young adults.\r"

  ".U": "88154046\r", 
  ".W": "Hormonal measurements in maternal urine and amniotic fluid (AF) during pregnancy and/or at delivery correctly predicted the postnatal diagnosis of 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency congenital adrenal hyperplasia (11 beta-OH deficiency CAH) in 7 fetuses at risk. In the 4 affected ones, maternal urinary tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol (THS) excretion was high during the first trimester [0.3-2.2 mg/day (1.1-7.7 mumol/day)] and rose further during the third trimester [0.5-3.5 mg/day (1.8-12.3 mumol/day)] compared to urinary THS excretion in 20 normal pregnancies of the same gestational age (P less than 0.01). In 1 mother, dexamethasone administration (2 mg/day for 72 h) greatly reduced urinary THS excretion (and plasma steroid levels). Urinary THS excretion was low after delivery in these mothers, in normal pregnancies, and in parents of affected individuals [less than 0.05 mg/day (less than 0.08 mumol/day); P = NS]. However, 2 of the 3 heterozygous mothers who carried nonaffected fetuses excreted moderately increased amounts of THS during pregnancy, ranging from 0.15-0.26 mg/day (0.53-0.91 mumol/day), significantly higher than normal (P less than 0.01). Although urinary THS excretion in these mothers was similar to that in 2 mothers with affected fetuses early in pregnancy, urinary THS excretion was higher in mothers with affected compared to those with nonaffected fetuses after the first trimester (P less than 0.01). AF THS and 11-deoxycortisol concentrations were markedly elevated in pregnancies with affected fetuses (P less than 0.01), but normal in nonaffected ones. AF delta 4-androstenedione levels were high in 2 pregnancies and borderline elevated in a third. Although the AF tetrahydrocortisol and tetrahydrocortisone levels were always within the normal range, the AF THS to tetrahydrocortisol plus tetrahydrocortisone ratio was significantly elevated in all pregnancies with affected fetuses (2.8-5.5; P less than 0.01) and normal in nonaffected ones (0.48-1.2; P = NS) compared to that in 160 normal pregnancies [0.64 +/- 0.34 (+/- SD)]. AF 17-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, and 11-deoxycorticosterone levels were normal in all pregnancies. Maternal plasma 11-deoxycortisol and delta 4-androstenedione concentrations, determined sequentially throughout gestation, were variable and did not contribute to prenatal diagnosis. All affected infants were born hyperpigmented, 2 were large for gestational age, and the female was severely virilized. In the first week of life 2 males developed severe hypertension with seizures and adrenal insufficiency, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88154049\r", 
  ".W": "To explore the diurnal variation and the relationship between serum hCG levels and thyroid function during pregnancy, 26 women with an uncomplicated early pregnancy were studied before and after interruption of pregnancy. The high serum hCG levels in early pregnancy were accompanied by an increase in serum thyroid hormone and a decrease in serum TSH levels. Nevertheless, serum TSH exhibited diurnal variation similar to that in nonpregnant women. The nocturnal surge of TSH exceeded the daytime nadir by 112% and was distinctly different from the normal serum cortisol variation. The diurnal serum T4 and hCG variations were similar to the variation in serum protein concentrations. After pregnancy interruption, serum hCG levels decreased by 95% within 10 days, and TSH levels rose concomitantly from 0.80 to 1.48 mIU/L (P less than 0.001). In individual women serum hCG correlated negatively with TSH (r = 0.322; P = 0.005) and positively with free T3 (r = 0.388; P less than 0.001). These results suggest that hCG has thyrotropic activity, which, through rises in thyroid hormone levels, suppresses TSH secretion. In this regard, 27,000-128,000 IU hCG correspond to 1 mIU TSH. Pregnancy-induced changes in thyroid function, however, do not affect the circadian TSH rhythm.\r"

  ".U": "88154050\r", 
  ".W": "Since the effects of the new low estrogen-containing oral contraceptive (OC) preparations on lipoprotein phospholipid (PL) composition are unknown, we studied 3 groups of 10 young women before and after 6 months of use of 3 commonly prescribed agents containing almost identical amounts of ethinyl estradiol (0.30-0.35 microgram) and differing progestogens, and correlated these changes with their estrogen to progestin (E/P) ratio. The directional changes in both plasma neutral lipid and PL concentrations tended to correlate with the E/P ratio, with plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) falling slightly and the low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)/HDL-C ratio increasing in the women taking the OC with the lowest E/P ratio; in contrast, plasma HDL-C increased and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio fell in those receiving the preparation with the highest E/P ratio. In HDL, the ratio of the 2 principal PL, sphingomyelin and lecithin, an index of lipid fluidity, tended to increase, suggesting that the surface of this lipoprotein class had become more rigid. This change was most apparent in women receiving the agent in which the progestin was predominant; in women receiving the preparations with the higher E/P ratios the sphingomyelin/lecithin ratio actually declined. The membrane fluidity of mononuclear cells obtained from five women taking an OC with a relatively high E/P ratio, however, was significantly increased (P less than 0.007) compared to that in normal women. These findings demonstrate that, even with substantial reductions in their estrogen content, the use of these newer OC is associated with quantitative and qualitative changes in lipoprotein PL composition that parallel their E/P balance and are associated with altered fluidity of mononuclear cell membranes.\r"

The purpose of this report is to describe the effect of hyperprolactinemia on gonadotropin secretion and hot flashes in menopausal women before and after treatment with a dopamine agonist. We studied two such women with prolactinomas. Both had plasma LH and FSH levels in the range found in premenopausal women and no hot flashes. Treatment with bromocriptine was associated with normalization of plasma PRL levels, elevation of plasma gonadotropin levels, and the onset of menopausal hot flashes in both patients. We conclude that hyperprolactinemia can inhibit the augmented gonadotropin secretion that occurs in postmenopausal women and prevent hot flashes.\r"

  ".W": "Although stimulation of PRL secretion in the early postpartum period has been found to improve lactational performance, the effect of chronic maintenance of elevated plasma PRL levels on milk production is not known. In a randomized design, 66 lactating women were assigned to receive either a placebo (n = 32) or the dopamine antagonist sulpiride (n = 34; 100 mg, three times daily), for 4 days, followed by 50 mg, three times daily, for a 90-day period). Their basal and 30 min postsuckling plasma PRL levels as well as the weights of their infants were measured 1, 4, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days postpartum. Forty-one women (20 sulpiride-treated and 21 placebo-treated) completed the study. Compared with the placebo group, which had the expected postpartum plasma PRL decline, the sulpiride-treated women maintained significantly elevated basal plasma PRL values up to the 90th postpartum day. In contrast, the postsuckling plasma PRL level was significantly diminished in the latter group, and on day 90 was practically absent. On day 15, weight gain was significantly greater in the infants whose mothers received sulpiride, but later, no differences were detectable between groups of infants despite the disparity in PRL levels in their mothers. We conclude that enhancement of PRL secretion in the early postpartum period may transiently increase milk production, but chronic hyperprolactinemia has no effect on lactational performance. The plasma PRL response to suckling is not essential for the maintenance of milk secretion. Instead, basal plasma PRL levels and neurogenic reflexes may be more instrumental in maintaining established lactation.\r"

  ".W": "A 46-yr-old man had typical Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and a serum monoclonal immunoglobulin (MIgG kappa). There was no evidence of disseminated lymphoid malignancy. Because of rapid enlargement of the goiter with pressure symptoms, a total thyroidectomy was performed. The surgery was followed by the complete disappearance of the MIgG kappa paralleled by the disappearance of serum antithyroglobulin autoantibodies. Thyroid sections demonstrated HT. Direct immunofluorescence assay showed diffuse infiltration by lymphocytes and plasma cells that were mainly IgG kappa positive. Moreover, the serum MIgG kappa had antithyroglobulin activity, as demonstrated by two different methods, namely labeling of focused serum proteins with radioiodinated human thyroglobulin and immunoadsorption of the monoclonal IgG on a human thyroglobulin affinity column. These results demonstrate that a monoclonal antithyroglobulin autoantibody was produced within the thyroid in a patient with HT. As the production of a MIg is regarded as the last stage preceding the malignant transformation of normal B lymphocytes, this report strongly suggests that a B lymphoma can directly emerge from the intrathyroidal lymphocytes involved in the pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\r"

For these reasons, micrographic surgery is indicated. Over the past 5 years we have treated 24 such patients utilizing standard techniques for micrographic surgery. The patient population included twenty male and four female patients with ages ranging from 27 to 80 years. Histologically confirmed diagnoses included squamous cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease, verrucous carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, Paget's disease, and leiomyosarcoma. These were located on the penis, scrotum, perineum, and buttocks. Seven of these patients were considered to have recurrent tumors. Preexisting conditions existed in 6 patients, including balantis xerotica obliterans, trauma, decubitus ulcer, and hidradenitis suppurativa. All surgery was performed under local anesthesia in the cutaneous surgery unit. Average pretreatment tumor size was 2.0 X 1.9 cm. Average postoperative defect size was 4.5 X 3.7 cm. Tumors were excised with an average of three stages and 18 sections. Most defects (65%) were allowed to heal by secondary intention, five (21%) were closed primarily, and three were referred for closure. After surgery five patients developed metastases in their regional lymphatic system. No patients developed local recurrence. Micrographic surgery is a most useful treatment modality in patients with genital tumors for control of local disease. However, patients with squamous cell carcinoma should be considered for elective regional lymph node biopsy and/or dissection in conjunction with micrographically controlled excision of the primary tumor.\r"

The tumor cells showed no activity of phosphorylase and a weak activity of succinic dehydrogenase. Immunohistochemically, antihair keratin monoclonal antibodies specific for hair cells decorated the tumor cells, but carcinoembryonic antigen staining showed no positivity. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells underwent a keratinization forming a fingerprint pattern of keratin filaments; however, membrane-coating granules and marginal bands were not formed. These intraepidermal tumor cells may have cytologic natures similar to those of hair cortical cells. The term intraepidermal pilar epithelioma is proposed as a diagnosis for this tumor.\r"

Of 1157 consecutively treated new dermatology patients, 1106 (96%) agreed to a total skin examination. Important incidental lesions were found in 162 (15%) of these patients. The types of incidental findings included (1) rashes helpful in establishing the primary diagnosis--20 patients (1.8%); (2) important rashes unrelated to the primary diagnosis--37 patients (3.3%); (3) malignant tumors--22 patients (2.0%); (4) clinically dysplastic nevi--25 patients (2.3%); and (5) congenital nevi--31 patients (2.8%). One patient had an incidental melanoma and another was found to have Kaposi's sarcoma, which led to the diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is concluded that a complete skin examination is productive and it is recommended for all new dermatology patients.\r"

The skin kinetics in human volunteers have been studied after administration of 100 and 200 mg of itraconazole daily. From day 7 onward, tissue levels in the beard region and on the back were consistently higher than the corresponding plasma levels. The levels in the palmar stratum corneum were lower than the corresponding plasma levels but persisted for 3 weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Stratum corneum levels in the beard area were still measurable 4 weeks after the end of therapy. With the 200-mg dose, sweat levels became detectable 24 hours after the first drug intake. The sweat levels were usually lower than the corresponding plasma levels and followed the same curve as the plasma levels. Sebum levels of itraconazole were 10 times as high as the corresponding peak plasma levels. Sebum levels were undetectable 14 days after discontinuation of therapy. The results indicate that oral intake of itraconazole will result in therapeutic levels in the skin and these levels vary, depending on the region of skin tested. There are at least three routes of delivery of itraconazole to the skin: (1) passive uptake by keratinocytes in the basal layer (as shown by the continued presence of the drug in the palmar stratum corneum at a moment when plasma, sebum, and sweat levels are again undetectable); (2) a less significant excretion through the sweat glands (as shown by the lower drug levels compared with the plasma levels); and (3) a massive excretion through the sebaceous glands (as shown by the sebum levels compared with the plasma levels).\r"

The purpose of the present study was to determine the therapeutic effect of intralesional injections of 15-HETE. 15-HETE was formed by oxidation of arachidonic acid by soybean lipoxygenase, purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and identified by mass spectrometric analysis. Thirteen patients took part in the investigation. Plaques with a diameter of approximately 1 cm were injected with 0.1 ml of 10 mumol/L 15-HETE, 0.1 ml of 1 mumol/L 15-HETE, or 0.1 ml of saline weekly. After 3 weeks the effect was evaluated clinically and histologically by an observer uniformed of the treatment given. We found that plaques injected with 10 mumol/L 15-HETE had cleared completely in four patients and improved considerably in seven. In one patient minimal improvement only was seen and in one patient no change was observed. Injection of 1 mumol/L 15-HETE was without effect in 11 patients and improvement was observed in two patients. Of the plaques injected with saline, minimal improvement was observed in one patient; otherwise the plaques had not changed. Injection of 0.1 ml of 10 mumol/L 15-HEPE (identical to 15-HETE except for five double bonds instead of four) induced only minimal improvement in one of four patients. The results imply that 15-HETE by a dose-dependent and stereospecific mechanism can improve psoriasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By this technique, lesional mast cells from patients with adult systemic mastocytosis had a significantly larger mean cytoplasmic area (53.3 microns2), nuclear size (20.4 microns2), and granule diameter (0.81 micron) when compared with mast cells from adults with nonsystemic mastocytosis (36.3 micron 2, 15.4 microns2, and 0.67 micron, respectively) and normal age-matched control subjects (34.4 microns2, 14.1 microns2, and 0.67 micron, respectively). Lesional skin mast cells from infants with nonsytemic mastocytosis were very similar to adult nonsystemic mastocytosis mast cells but differed by several parameters from mast cells in adults with systemic involvement. This study demonstrates that there are quantitative differences between lesional skin mast cells from patients with systemic mastocytosis and those with nonsystemic disease.\r"

These self-ratings were compared to the objective ratings made by their dermatologists. Acne patients who self-rated their conditions as severe were found to experience significantly higher levels of trait anxiety than patients with mild and moderate conditions and control subjects; patients with severe and moderate conditions showed a higher state of anxiety than control subjects. Acne patients rated as severe by their dermatologists showed higher states of anxiety, \"anger-in,\" and \"anger-out\" than the others. No other significant differences in terms of severity emerged, supporting the view that acne patients are not markedly neurotic. The results suggest that anxiety and anger are significant factors for severe acne patients and that future research should include severity ratings from both patients and physicians in the research design.\r"

We propose a natural avian model for Kaposi's sarcoma. Hemangiomatosis of fowls corresponds clinically and pathologically to the human disease, with characteristics including predilection for distal skin, multicentricity with organ involvement, bleeding and recurrence after excision. Pathologic stages are also similar and include initial dissection of collagen by benign endothelial cells, the formation of large blood-filled spaces, spindle cell growth, and progression to fibrosarcomalike tumors. Avian hemangiomatosis is induced by a retrovirus of the lymphoid leukosis group and has been associated with laboratory transmission of lymphomatosis. An etiopathologic parallel should be sought in man.\r"

Asthma activity was assessed by (1) daily symptom and medication diaries and (2) monthly auscultation and spirometry during pregnancy and for 3 months post partum. At 3 months post partum, subjects were asked to assess the overall course of their asthma during pregnancy compared to the usual course for them, and the course of their asthma during the 3 months post partum compared to the asthma during pregnancy. Asthma worsened during pregnancy in 35% of the women, improved in 28%, and was unchanged in 33%. Based on diary-card analysis, asthma was significantly less frequent and less severe during the last 4 weeks of pregnancy than during any other gestational interval. In women whose asthma improved during pregnancy, diary-card analysis revealed a gradual improvement with progressive pregnancy, whereas in women whose asthma worsened during pregnancy, there was an increase in asthma symptoms during 29 to 36 weeks gestation. During labor and delivery, asthma symptoms occurred in 10% of women with approximately equal proportions of these women receiving either no treatment or inhaled bronchodilators; only two subjects required intravenous aminophylline. During the 3 months post partum, asthma reverted toward its prepregnancy course in 73% of women. In 34 subjects prospectively studied for two successive pregnancies, there existed a significant concordance between the asthma course during the first and second pregnancies. The mechanistic and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Allergic symptoms occur commonly in subjects working closely with locusts and are associated with specific IgE antibody. Extracts of intact locusts (Schistocerca gregaria and Locusta migratoria) were used to identify specific IgE antibody, to define the major allergens of the locust and their sources, and to estimate aeroallergen concentration in the working environment. With questionnaire, skin prick tests, and specific IgE measurements, 35 individuals, working in a research center, were surveyed. Of the 15 currently exposed individuals, contact with locusts provoked asthma, rhinitis, and contact urticaria in five, rhinitis and urticaria in three, and rhinitis alone in one individual. Symptoms provoked by locusts and skin test reactions to locust extracts were associated with specific IgE antibody in the serum. The \"immunoblot\" technique demonstrated the presence of multiple allergens in the locust extracts of approximately 68, 66, 54, 43, 37, 29, and 18 K daltons molecular weight. Locust antigen was identified in the atmosphere by means of an immunochemical method involving elution of high-volume air-sampler filters exposed in the locust breeding room and analysis of eluate allergen content by RAST-inhibition assays. Logit transformation of RAST-inhibition lines demonstrated that the filter extract shared a common slope with the locust extract and with an extract of locust gut. This gut extract also shared a common slope with extracts of locust feces and peritrophic membrane. The major source of allergen appears to be the peritrophic membrane that is present in the gut and is excreted surrounding the feces.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the relationship between attenuation of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and serum theophylline concentration in a dose-dependent fashion in 11 patients with mild bronchial asthma. In addition, we investigated the protection of equal amounts of theophylline either dissolved in ethylenediamine or in proxyphylline and diprophylline. At 4 separate study days, the patients received one of the following preparations in a double-blind random order: saline solution, 200 mg of theophylline in 19.9 mg of ethylenediamine (TE200), 351 mg of theophylline in 35 mg of ethylenediamine (TE351), and 200 mg of theophylline in 300 mg of propxyphylline and 300 mg of diprophylline (TPD). Fifteen minutes after the end of infusion, a standardized exercise test during cold air breathing was performed. Before and up to 30 minutes after each test, specific airway resistance and FEV, were determined. Postexertional bronchoconstriction after theophylline was expressed by means of a protection index, a value of 0 or 1 meaning no or full protection, respectively. At mean (SD) serum theophylline concentrations of 6.7 (1.3), 10.1 (1.7), and 6.3 (1.4) mg/L, respectively, TE200, TE351, and TPD for specific airway resistance caused a significant bronchodilation (p less than 0.05) and resulted in mean (SD) protection indices of 0.61 (0.15), 0.82 (0.14), and 0.65 (0.20), respectively, being significantly different from 0 (p less than 0.01). The protective effect of TE200 and TPD was equal and significantly less pronounced as compared to TE351 (p less than 0.01). Therefore, theophylline attenuated exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in a dose-dependent fashion with significant protection at serum concentrations of about 6 mg/L. The effect of intravenous theophylline was independent of the diluents.\r"

The results obtained with the sulfite test strips compared favorably to the results of the Monier-Williams procedure when the sulfite test strips were used on sulfite-treated lettuce and raw or cooked potatoes. However, the strips yielded many false negative and false positive results with other types of foods. False positive results (strips indicated a substantial amount of sulfite when sulfite was not detectable by the Monier-Williams method) were obtained with fin fish, red meats, and poultry. False negative results (strips indicated the absence of sulfites when sulfite was detected at levels greater than 10 ppm total sulfur dioxide by the Monier-Williams method) were obtained with dried fruits and wines under certain conditions of testing. The false negative responses with the test strips may result in the hazardous consumption of foods with high levels of sulfites, such as dried fruit or wine, by a sulfite-sensitive individual. The false positive responses would not be hazardous but could lead sensitive individuals to avoid foods that could be safely consumed. Although the strips may be useful for the detection of sulfites in certain foods, such as lettuce and potatoes, their use by sulfite-sensitive individuals cannot be recommended because of the confusion and potential hazards posed by the false negative and false positive responses.\r"

Finally, the blood flow was measured after unilateral allergen challenge in the contralateral nasal cavity. A dose-dependent decrease in blood flow was found after nasal challenge with increasing doses of allergens, whereas challenge with diluent alone did not induce any changes. The highest allergen dose, which also induced pronounced nasal symptoms, resulted in a decrease in blood flow of 25% (p less than 0.001). The time-course study demonstrated a maximum decrease in blood flow 10 to 20 minutes after challenge and then a gradual return to baseline. Unilateral allergen challenge resulted in a decrease in blood flow in the contralateral, unchallenged nasal cavity, suggesting that part of the allergen-induced changes in blood flow were reflex mediated.\r"

Both activities were absorbed by IgG, suggesting that they were due to a single material. Phenol itself neither fixed complement nor formed a precipitate with IgG. 14C-labeled phenol was incorporated into the IgG precipitating material. Both the amplification of complement-fixing activity and the appearance of IgG-precipitating activity in phenol-containing grain-dust extract were dependent on the presence of air and were inhibited by heating the extract before phenol addition. One interpretation of these results is that a component of grain-dust extract, possibly an enzyme, oxidatively modifies phenol to a form that fixes complement and precipitates IgG. The modified material demonstrates properties of a polyphenol (tannin).\r"

Crude whole body extracts were prepared in our laboratory from both American (Periplaneta americana) and German (Blatella germanica) cockroach species. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of American cockroach whole body extract (AWBE) and German cockroach whole body extract (GWBE) detected a total of 50 and 56 precipitin peaks, respectively, when extracts were reacted with hyperimmunized rabbit antisera. Crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis identified at least five electrophoretically distinct allergens each in AWBE and GWBE. Cockroach whole body extracts produced two major protein peaks when extracts were fractionated on Sephadex G-75. RAST-inhibition studies demonstrated allergens in both peak 1 and the immediate trailing fractions of the column. Direct RAST and end point prick skin testing confirmed the presence of significant/important allergens in column \"fraction 2\" of AWBE. Skin testing and RAST analysis suggested the occurrence of shared and species-specific allergens between AWBE and GWBE. Collectively, these studies confirm the important sensitizing potential of cockroach allergens, characterize their number and size distribution by crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis and column chromatography, support the occurrence of significant allergens in column \"fraction 2,\" and suggest the occurrence of both species-specific and shared interspecies allergens.\r"

  ".W": "Both the pattern of mediator release during the late-phase response (LPR) and the reduction of the LPR with corticosteroid pretreatment have suggested that basophils, not mast cells, represent the main source of histamine in the late response to nasal antigen challenge. We tested this hypothesis by examining alcian blue-stained cytospin slides of nasal washings obtained before and for 11 hours after nasal antigen challenge in 11 asymptomatic subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In a double-blind manner, subjects received placebo or topical flunisolide (50 micrograms, each nostril, twice daily) for 1 week before antigen challenge. One month later, the challenge was repeated with the alternate pretreatment. On placebo-treatment days, a twelve-fold increase occurred in the number and a threefold increase in the percentage of alcian blue-stained positive cells in nasal washings in the LPR compared to baseline. At least 68% of these alcian blue-stained positive cells were basophils, as determined by light microscopic criteria. Alcian blue-stained cell influx correlated with increases in histamine levels in nasal washes (p less than 0.001). Topical steroid pretreatment blocked the influx of alcian blue-stained positive cells, as well as other inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells. Symptoms and mediator release were also blocked. These data demonstrate an influx of basophils and suggest that these cells are responsible for the histamine release observed in the LPR. Our findings indicate that pharmacologic control of basophil histamine release may represent a strategy for the treatment of a variety of chronic allergic diseases that are believed to resemble the LPR.\r"

This study was undertaken to investigate whether grain dust could stimulate the production of histamine-releasing factor (HRF) by guinea pig spleen cells. We also studied the direct action of grain dust on guinea pig lung mast cells and basophils. Plastic nonadherent cells from immunized animals were cultured for 24 hours in the presence of grain dust or lipopolysaccharide, and the cell-free supernatants were assayed for HRF activity in the mast cell and basophil histamine release test. Lung mast cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion and discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation. It has been demonstrated that grain dust stimulated the production of HRF by spleen cells from the immunized animals but not from the control animals. Stimulation of spleen cells with lipopolysaccharide did not enhance the HRF production. Gel chromatography of grain dust-stimulated supernatant revealed that HRF has a molecular weight in the range of 50 to 70 kd and 5 to 8 kd. We also found that grain dust directly released significant amount of histamine from both mast cells and basophils. The results of this study suggest that grain dust contains some potent active substances that can activate lymphocytes, mast cells, and basophils.\r"

  ".W": "Maintenance hemodialysis is widely used throughout the world, and anaphylactic reactions appear to be increasing in number and severity. However, the exact incidence of sensitization and the role of atopy in these reactions are not yet fully understood. All of the 111 patients routinely dialyzed in a center were tested. All patients had a complete investigation of atopy, RAST to chemicals released during the procedure of dialysis (ethylene oxide (Eto), formaldehyde, phthalic anhydride, and toluene diisocyanate), skin tests with the effluent, and the titration of blood eosinophils. The incidence of atopy was found to be lower (13.5%) than in the normal population of the area. Skin tests with either histamine or allergens are significantly (p less than 0.001) smaller than those of nondialyzed subjects, and this method does not appear to be ideal in this population of patients. Eto sensitivity ranked first (5.5%), followed by phthalic anhydride sensitivity (3.6%); 5/6 patients who had a sensitivity to Eto and/or phthalic anhydride presented symptoms during dialysis, but they never were life threatening. Formaldehyde RAST was only found in one patient who had a life-threatening reaction. Finally, three patients presenting pruritus had positive skin prick tests with the effluent of the dialyzer. All patients having a first use syndrome and 80/81 symptom-free patients did not have serum-specific IgE against the released chemicals, 5/17 patients who had a pruritus during dialysis had either positive RAST to released chemicals or skin tests to the effluent, 5/8 patients who suffered from anaphylaxis had positive RAST to released chemicals, but only those who had a positive RAST presented a severe reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although monoclonal antibodies have many properties that enable them to be shared internationally, it is difficult to know from the literature what monoclonal antibodies are available and, in some cases, what are the individual characteristics of the antibodies. We are organizing an on-line data base of information about allergen-reactive monoclonal antibodies, which can be accessed by computer with international telecommunications networks. Each record of a monoclonal antibody includes details, if they are known, of allergen source and name, antibody production, complimentary antigenic determinant, names and addresses of the owners, availability of the antibody, and other important information. Investigators who have produced monoclonal antibodies that react with allergens are invited to submit details of the antibodies for inclusion in the data base.\r"

The study sample comprised 553 college students who were randomly assigned to one of seven groups. Each group received a nutrient analysis computer printout that varied in terms of type, amount, and format of information supplied. Printouts with varying characteristics were used in order to identify those elements that contributed to the greatest and most correct understanding and interpretation. A 30-item objective knowledge test was used to assess understanding and ability to interpret information on the printouts. Research results indicate that most individuals had misconceptions concerning the RDAs and vitamin and mineral supplementation. Recommendations were made for improving the information provided on printouts regarding these two topics. Subjects had little difficulty in reading the printout correctly. However, groups whose printouts included only nutrient data generally had more difficulty using the information to draw appropriate conclusions and identify ways to improve dietary intake than did individuals whose printouts included short messages listing sources and functions of nutrients. Data presented in graphic format were more easily understood than data in spreadsheet form. Eight design recommendations intended to assist nutritionists and software designers in selecting and/or creating printouts were made on the basis of the results of this study.\r"

Gastrointestinal transit time was measured using four different markers: plastic pellets, chromium mordanted bran, cobalt-ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid, and terbium oxide. The wet weight and dry weight of stools were measured, and a questionnaire accessed subjects' perceptions of the consistency of their stools. Fiber supplementation decreased transit time and increased the daily number of defecations and the wet weight and dry weight of stools. Bran had a greater effect on transit time than psyllium. Psyllium had a greater effect on the amount of water found in the stools and the total stool weight. On the days that stools were passed, 50% of the daily stool ratings were scored as \"hard\" when subjects received the control supplement. Less than 10% of the ratings were scored as \"hard\" when subjects received the high-fiber supplements. The type of marker used did not significantly affect the transit time measured.\r"

The interdisciplinary approach entails the participation of professional and support staff, along with the client and his/her family, in diagnosis, individual program planning, implementation, and evaluation. For example, interdisciplinary case management for a patient with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) results in cost-effective, efficacious treatment. Because of the diversity of symptoms, the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome must incorporate knowledge and skills from a variety of areas. A model for the interdisciplinary case management of PWS is presented. The model is problem focused and emphasizes goals formulated and acted upon by the disciplines represented on the client's treatment team. Communication and coordination of efforts are central to the utility of the model. Additional benefits of interdisciplinary case management include the opportunity for ongoing education and role expansion of team members.\r"

  ".U": "88154286\r", 
  ".W": "This study has identified some potentially important characteristics of elderly women who overuse vitamin and mineral supplements. These women tended to live alone and to have medical problems. The supplements were usually self-prescribed and purchased in a drugstore. The sources of information that supported supplement use were primarily the print media and family and friends rather than health professionals. Other studies have made similar findings. The degree of IHLC orientation failed to predict the amount of supplement use, although IHLC was shown to be useful in a recent study that included both young and elderly women. Thus, from our perspective, the identification of possible overusers of supplements should begin with elderly women who have health problems and live alone; point-of-purchase information should be targeted to drugstores. In this study and in other, either the actual reasons for supplement use were often inappropriate or the diets were adequate in many of the vitamins taken by supplements, such as vitamins A and C. Thus, education for elderly women that stresses the appropriate reasons for nutrient supplement use is clearly needed so that a correct link between nutrition need and use always is maintained. The high IHLC scores suggest that the majority of women in this study want to make their own decisions about their health. Given better information, overusers of supplements might instead choose a more reasonable approach for improving their diets. Dietitians/nutritionists were not usually used as a source of nutrition information by the elderly women in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The average T alpha 1 level was highest (approximately 60 ng/ml) at 3 wk and fell sharply such that 2 mo old mice fed either normal (N, approximately 80% of ad libitum intake) or restricted (R, approximately 50% of ad libitum intake) diets averaged approximately 20 ng/ml. Any age-related declines after 2 mo of age were mild and statistically significant only for R mice bled 2-4 h (but not 24-48 h) post-feeding. T alpha 1 levels were lower in group R than in group N mice in one experiment at 19 mo of age but not in another at 26 mo. The decline with age in serum T alpha 1 levels is mainly a very early life event for mice of this hybrid strain and appears uninfluenced by DR. T alpha 1 levels are variably reduced by DR later in life.\r"

By 24 mo valine incorporation was 30% of the 6-mo value. Food restriction had no effect at 3 mo of age (6 wk of restriction) but at 6 mo the rate of valine incorporation was 35% greater than the control, an increment that was maintained throughout the life of the animal. Therefore, although food restriction does not prevent the age-related decline in protein synthesis, it does maintain the rate of liver valine incorporation at levels greater than those observed in the liver of the ad libitum fed animal.\r"

A recent treatment strategy is to combine drugs, particularly cholinergic drugs, to improve their memory enhancing effect. We previously reported that in young, weakly trained mice, the combination of arecoline and tacrine was more effective on a mg/kg basis than either drug administered alone. This was true whether the route of administration was intracerebroventricular, subcutaneous, or oral. These drug treatments have also been found to improve retention in 24-month-old mice. Mice 24 months of age show very poor recall one week after training. Failing memory must develop over time but may only be detected in mice younger than 24 months of age when the retention test interval is substantially longer. We now report that 18-month-old mice trained to avoid footshock in a T-maze show poor retention when tested two months after training and drug administration. Subcutaneous administration of arecoline, tacrine, and arecoline plus tacrine all enhanced retention of 18-month-old mice compared to the saline-injected control. The combination was as effective as the single drug treatments even though 96% less arecoline and 99.7% less tacrine were administered.\r"

Elderly outpatients (N = 126) with five common chronic diseases (arthritis, ischemic heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer) and their physicians were interviewed to better characterize patient quality of life. Patients generally perceived their quality of life to be slightly worse than \"good, no major complaints\" in each chronic disease. Physicians' ratings were generally worse than and only weakly associated with the patients' ratings of quality of life in each chronic disease. Significant independent correlates of patients' ratings of quality of life included the patients' perceptions of their health, interpersonal relationships, and finances. These results suggest that quality of life in elderly outpatients with chronic disease is a multidimensional construct involving health, as well as social and other factors. Physicians may misunderstand patients' perceptions of their quality of life.\r"

The results revealed that measures of previous use of health care services were more strongly related to current use of health care services in 1979 than were measures of previous health status. Inclusion of previous use and previous health status variables almost doubled the amount of variance explained by current predictors in number of physician visits, and more than doubled the explained variance in having to put off health care while the amount of variance explained in number of hospital episodes and in number of hospitalized nights was increased by approximately one-third.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 230 independently living healthy elderly men and women to examine the hypothesis that subclinical nutritional deficiencies contributed to depressed immune function seen in the elderly. Immunologic function was assessed with delayed type hypersensitivity skin testing to four antigens, in vitro lymphocyte culture with phytohemagglutinin, lymphocyte count, and presence of serum autoantibodies and circulating immune complexes. Nutritional status was assessed by 3-day diet records and also biochemical analyses of blood for vitamins A, B12, C, D, E, riboflavin, folic acid, and the minerals iron, copper, and zinc. Using a variety of analyses we found no association between malnutrition and depressed immunologic function in this population. We conclude that subtle nutritional deficiency is not a noticeable contributor to the immunodeficiency of aging, and that previously reported beneficial effects of \"megadose\" nutritional supplements on the immune response of elderly individuals probably represent a pharmacologic effect rather than the correction of nutritional deficiencies.\r"

In the first study, 346 elderly people were classified into three categories of verbosity on the basis of their verbal behavior during an interview and questionnaire session. Personality variables, stress in daily living, and age differentiated extremely verbose individuals from others. In the second study, frequency and extent of off-target speech were rated quantitatively for the verbal behavior of 203 older men, with a second rater independently making the same ratings for 98 of the men. Classification into the three categories of verbosity was made for 179 of the men. Interrater reliability was established at .76 and .70 for the two measures of verbosity. There was significant agreement between the qualitative classification and the quantitative rating assessments of verbosity. In addition to the previously found associations between verbosity and personality and social variables, higher nonverbal intellectual performance scores obtained in the early adult years combined with poorer current nonverbal scores predicted verbosity in late life.\r"

They also completed a reminiscence questionnaire and a measure of current well-being, the Bradburn Affect Balance Scale (ABS). The autobiographical memory data revealed significant increases across the three age groups in both the average time taken to respond to prompt words and the average \"age\" of reported memories. Age differences in reminiscence also were found. The hypothesis that persons who actively reminisce would respond more quickly and with more remote memories in the autobiographical memory task was not supported.

The present study examined the association between frequency of depressed mood, using the Depression Adjective Checklist (DACL), and self-reports of four sleep problems over a 3-year period in a sample of community-residing elderly persons. Results showed that frequency of depressed affect was related positively to sleep disturbance, even when subjects' age, gender, and health status were considered simultaneously. Early morning awakening was the sleep symptom that most consistently related to depressed mood over the course of the study. Poor health and female gender showed positive but less consistent relationships to the sleep complaints than depressed affect. Research on biological mechanisms underlying the disturbed sleep of elderly depressed individuals is discussed.\r"

Based on interview data with 281 older women, a series of regression analyses indicated that, before the inclusion of the coping variables, physical conditions directly contributed to functional impairment, and both indirectly lowered life satisfaction through their direct negative effects on subjective health assessments. Further analyses indicated that positive-cognitive coping buffered the effects of physical conditions at each point in the model, that passive-cognitive coping generally had deleterious effects on health status, although it prevented negative health assessments from lowering life satisfaction, and that direct-action coping had little effect. These findings emphasize the importance of a multidimensional conceptualization of physical health status in understanding its relationship with life satisfaction as well as the specific functions of coping at different points in the process for older women.\r"

Logistic regression was used because the response variable was dichotomous and because several explanatory variables, which were both categorical and continuous, were being examined simultaneously. The findings indicated that people tended to confide in more distant family or nonfamily when close family members were not available. The relative importance of variables differed substantially between types of confiding relationships and between gender and age groups of respondents. Our findings suggest the need for longitudinal research and more sensitive methods of analysis in exploring the complexities of maintaining and re-forming primary bonds through the course of old age.\r"

It was hypothesized that elderly people with strong social support systems would be less likely to visit a physician in times of high stress than would older adults who receive less social support. This hypothesis was partially confirmed by the data. The second goal of this study was to determine whether or not locus of control beliefs buffer the effects of stress on physician use. The data suggest that elderly persons with internal locus of control beliefs make fewer visits to the doctor's office in times of high stress than do those individuals with an external locus of control orientation. It should be noted that this study did not assess changes in physician use through time and that information on stress was gathered 18 months prior to the gathering of information on physician utilization.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously described a T cell hybridoma, A.1.1, that responds to specific Ag (P18, a synthetic polypeptide of defined sequence) in the context of I-Ad by producing lymphokines. Herein we report that this cell also releases, into culture supernatants and ascites fluid, an Ag-specific activity that functions in the induction of suppression of anti-SRBC PFC responses. This suppressive activity requires a) Ag-non-specific accessory molecules from a T suppressor inducer factor, b) Ly-2+ T cells in the assay cultures, and c) the specific Ag (P18) conjugated to the SRBC in the assay cultures. The specificity of the A.1.1-derived activity was demonstrated by the absence of suppression in cultures containing SRBC, BSA-SRBC, or conalbumin-SRBC rather than P18-SRBC. Further, the A.1.1-derived activity bound to, and could be eluted from, P18 but not conalbumin. Using a panel of synthetic variant peptides, we have mapped the critical residues in P18 required for Ag/I-Ad induced activation of A.1.1. These peptides were tested for their ability to act as targets for the A.1.1-derived suppressive activity when conjugated to SRBC and added to assay cultures. All peptides capable of stimulating the A.1.1 T cells to release lymphokines were similarly effective in the suppressor assay. Thus, the recognition of Ag by the T cells and by the T cell-derived activity appeared to be identical. The A.1.1-derived molecule was found to be capable of inducing L3T4- T cells to act as suppressor T cells following culture. These suppressor cells were active in inhibiting anti-SRBC responses in the absence of P18 and bore the Ly-2 surface marker. Thus, it is likely that the function of this Ag-specific molecule is to induce Ly-2+ suppressor T cells and thereby cause the inhibition of the response. This function is distinct from that normally associated with helper T cells and may shed new light on the possible relationship between the cell surface T cell receptor for Ag and Ag-specific T suppressor inducer molecules.\r"

A human gamma-globulin (HGG)-specific lymph node cell proliferation is not influenced. BVI/5 Ts cells injected into mice at the time of priming with fluorescein (Flu)-conjugated BSA or Flu-HGG inhibit the humoral anti-Flu-response in Flu-BSA-primed animals. The anti-Flu-response in Flu-HGG-primed animals is only marginally affected by BVI/5 Ts cells. The data show that it is possible to induce immunologic unresponsiveness at the humoral level by reexposing in vitro propagated Ts cell clones to their syngenic in vivo environment.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is an organ-specific, T lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune disease, which serves as a model for several human ocular inflammations of an apparently autoimmune nature. EAU pathology in some rodents and in monkeys can readily be induced by immunization with several different retinal proteins; however, advancing research into the cellular mechanisms of this disease has raised the need for an EAU model in an immunologically and genetically well defined species. We report here the induction of EAU in the mouse, which has hitherto been considered a species refractory to EAU, with two retinal Ag, the retinal soluble Ag and the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein. Although all the mouse strains tested exhibited lymphocyte responses and antibody titers to both retinal Ag, EAU was inducible in only some of the strains, and the uveitogenic responses to retinal soluble Ag and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein appeared to be mutually exclusive. The EAU model in mice was found to differ in several respects from the EAU model in other rodent species. Induction of the disease was achieved with a relatively high dose of Ag and an intensified immunization protocol, and the onset of disease was later, the duration was longer, and the course was less acute. Anterior segment involvement was slight or nonexistent, and damage to the retina and uvea was of a focal rather than of a diffuse nature. Murine EAU appeared to approximate some types of human uveitis more closely than the EAU models described in other rodent species with respect to its pathologic manifestations as well as its more chronic course. The relatively longer duration of the active stage of disease in murine EAU should facilitate therapeutic intervention in established disease, which was not feasible in the more acute models of EAU. The extensive knowledge of the immunologic parameters of the mouse and the availability of genetically defined strains should be of great value in the study of cellular mechanisms and immunogenetics of ocular autoimmune disease.\r"

Liposomes containing dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine, cholesterol, and cerebrosides at molar ratios of 1.0/0.75/0.33 activated the alternative pathway in human serum treated with MgEGTA. Activation was measured by C3 conversion and the deposition of total C3 and functional C3b on the liposome surface. The monosialoganglioside GM1, when incorporated into the activating liposome membrane at molar ratios between 10(-5) and 10(-2), inhibited activation in a dose-dependent manner. Sialosylparagloboside also inhibited activation in human serum, and inhibition was completely reversed after neuraminidase treatment. The degree of inhibition by GM1 correlated with the relative amount of GM1 exposed on the liposome surface. Sialic acid did not directly inhibit the binding of C3b when liposomes containing gangliosides were incubated with the purified components C3, B, D, and P. GM1 did inhibit activation when liposomes were incubated with a mixture of purified C3, B, D, P, H, and I. Binding assays with radiolabeled H showed increased binding of H to liposome-bound C3b in the presence of GM1. These results establish the ability of sialic acid on glycolipids to promote H binding to C3b and thereby regulate alternative pathway activation on a defined lipid membrane.\r"

Gangliosides containing sialic acid residues with modifications in the N-acetyl group, carboxyl group, or polyhydroxylated tail were either isolated from natural sources or prepared by chemical modification of the native sialic acid structure. Sialic acid lost more than 90% of its inhibitory activity after removal of just the C9 carbon from the polyhydroxylated tail. Sialic acid was also unable to inhibit activation after converting the carboxyl group to a hydroxymethyl group. Galactose oxidase/NaB3H4 treatment of liposomes containing gangliosides with native or modified sialic acid residues confirmed that neither modification altered the amount of gangliosides exposed at the liposome surface. Changing the N-linked acetyl group to a glycolyl group had no effect on the inhibitory activity of sialic acid. These data further define the structural features of sialic acid that are important in regulation of alternative pathway activation. Both the C9 carbon of the polyhydroxylated tail and the carboxyl group are essential for this function; whereas, the N-linked acetyl group may be modified without loss of activity.\r"

  ".W": "Eosinophil major basic protein (MBP), a highly charged polycation, forms the core of the eosinophil granule and mediates tissue damage in allergic disease. Purified MBP was studied for capacity to regulate the generation of classical and alternative-amplification pathway C3 convertases because previous studies have shown that other polycations (protamine, poly-L-lysine) and polyanions (heparin) may play important roles in regulating C activation. MBP inhibited the generation of EAC1,4b,2a and EAC4b,3b,Bb,P but appeared to inhibit the generation of classical pathway convertase more than the alternative amplification pathway convertase at a given dose. Dose-response curves with MBP were steeper than curves seen with polyanion (heparin). MBP did not lyse cellular intermediates at concentrations that caused almost total inhibition of convertase generation. One mechanism of inhibition of convertase generation may have been through an action on C3b, because preincubation of MBP with an EAC4b,3b cellular intermediate interfered with the ability of this cellular intermediate to be lysed. Furthermore, MBP prevented consumption of B in a reaction mixture that contained factors B, D, and C3b, also suggesting an action on C3b. Reduced and alkylated MBP (A-MBP) was compared with native MBP, which possesses two reactive sulfhydryl groups, to determine whether charge alone is responsible for blocking convertase generation; native MBP rapidly associates and is relatively insoluble at neutral and alkaline pH whereas A-MBP remains soluble. A-MBP impaired convertase generation, did not appear to remain bound to cellular intermediates and did not suppress B consumption in the fluid phase assay. This suggests that the ability of MBP to regulate C activation is complex and not entirely through its net charge. Finally, although heparin or MBP alone may prevent C activation, when these substances were present at the same time there was no effect on C activation suggesting that charge neutralization may abrogate the effects of these charged substances on C activation. Taken together, these studies suggest that MBP at physiologic concentrations may regulate in vivo C activation at the tissue level.\r"

  ".W": "Anionic amphiphiles such as long chain unsaturated fatty acids and SDS were shown to activate the superoxide (O2-) producing NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system derived from sonically disrupted phagocytes (macrophages and granulocytes). O2- production required the cooperation of a membrane associated component sedimenting at 48,000 X g (pi) and a cytosolic factor (sigma). The purpose of the present investigation was to find out whether components pi and sigma were also present in non-phagocytic cells that do not produce O2- when stimulated. It was found that the 48,000 X g pellets of guinea pig lymph node and thymus cell sonicates contained significant amounts of component pi, as shown by their ability to support SDS-elicited NADPH-dependent O2- production when supplemented with macrophage cytosol. Lymph node and thymus pi could be extracted from the membrane by 30 mM octyl glucoside, just as its macrophage-derived equivalent. Combining lymph node and thymus 48,000 X g pellet with autologous cytosol did not yield an active enzyme preparation. Also, cytosol from lymph node and thymus cells could not cooperate with macrophage 48,000 X g pellet, indicating that component sigma was lacking in lymphoid cells. Neither pi nor sigma could be detected in guinea pig kidney, the mouse myeloma cell line MOPC 315 and the canine cell line Cf2Th. The 48,000 X g pellet of all nonphagocytic cells examined contained a b-cytochrome that resembled, by its spectral characteristics, the cytochrome b559 thought to be characteristic of phagocytes. In macrophages, cytochrome b559 represented 80% of b-cytochrome content of the 48,000 X g pellet, whereas in non-phagocytic cells, the equivalent material represented only 50 to 60%. There was no correlation between the presence and quantity of the cytochrome b559-like chromophore in the 48,000 X g pellet of a particular cell type and its ability to cooperate with macrophage cytosol in SDS-elicited O2- production.\r"

  ".U": "88154466\r", 
  ".W": "The AKR thymoma BW5147 has rearranged both of its TCR beta-chain loci, using the same J beta region (J beta 2.5) in each, but with different V beta gene segments. Although the two rearrangements are expressed approximately equally in cytoplasmic RNA, the principle of allelic exclusion is maintained because only one rearrangement is in-frame and capable of encoding a functional protein. In hybridomas made with BW5147 as the fusion partner, this protein may combine with the alpha-chain protein derived from the normal cell to form new Ag/MHC specificities. An analysis of the sequences upstream from the BW5147 rearrangements and additional V regions suggests that two conserved sequences, 10 and nine nucleotides in length and located adjacent to each other 70 to 100 nucleotides 5' of the initiation codon, may be important in the expression of TCR beta-chain genes. Although B and T cells derive from common stem cells, no sequences are observed in T cells that are homologous to the octamer located 5' of all Ig genes. This implies that at least some of the sequences that regulate transcription are not shared in the two major types of lymphocytes. A survey of BW5147 and six other AKR thymomas using probes for 10 of the 18 known V region families indicates a distribution of V beta rearrangements in the tumors consistent with that found in thymocytes. Four of these tumors have apparent VDJ rearrangements on both chromosomes, with the deletion of other V beta gene segments. These data suggest that the primary mechanism of VDJ beta rearrangement is by looping out and excision of the intervening DNA and that most of the V regions are located 5' to the C region. These data were also used to develop a deletion order of the V beta gene segments in the TCR beta-chain locus.\r"

  ".W": "We have correlated the intensity of expression of CD45 Ag (T200 common leukocyte Ag) with mAb reactive with various lineages of hemopoietic cells in normal human bone marrow by using two-color immunofluorescence on a flow cytometer. Mature T lymphocytes (CD3+) and NK cells (CD16+ or CD11b+) expressed CD45 at the highest intensity. B lymphoid cells (CD19+) had three distinct levels of CD45 Ag expression. The bright CD45(3+) cells were mature B cells (CD19+, CD20+), whereas the less intense CD45(2+) cells were less mature B lymphoid cells (CD19+, CD10+). The dim CD45+ cells were very early, B lymphoid precursor cells (CD19+, CD10(2+), CD34+). The intensity of CD45 expression increased as cells matured in the monocytic lineage (CD14+, CD11b+). Among marrow granulocytic cells, CD45 intensity did not change on cells during maturation. Within the erythroid lineage, the most immature cells were CD45+ dim, and CD45 expression decreased during erythroid maturation to become undetectable on mature E. Hemopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+) expressed low levels of CD45 Ag. Expression of CD45R on marrow cells also showed intensity differences on different lineages. All NK cells (CD16+) were positive for CD45R, whereas only about one-half of the T lymphocytes (CD3+) were positive for CD45R. Almost all the cells in the erythroid and myelomonocytic lineages were CD45R-. Quantitative differences in expression of CD45R were observed on marrow B lymphoid cells which were correlated with the expression of CD45. The results show that quantitative changes in CD45 Ag expression accompany the differentiation and maturation of cells in the bone marrow. Comparisons with CD45R showed that this Ag was not always correlated with CD45. Since these Ag are the products of the same gene, these data indicate that the regulation of expression of the T200 molecules during normal hemopoietic development must be both quantitative and qualitative.\r"

  ".W": "Antibody-independent activation of the alternative C pathway by human lymphoblastoid cell lines latently infected with EBV has been recognized for some time, although the mechanisms involved and the specific cell surface molecule(s) recognized by the C system have not been identified. The present studies, carried out with the purified proteins of the alternative pathway have addressed these questions. Activation of the purified proteins of the alternative pathway by Raji lymphoblastoid cells was found to be antibody independent, confirming earlier findings with serum. Surprisingly, activation was highly dependent on properdin. In other models properdin has been found to augment alternative pathway activation and to be required for lysis of virus infected cells. Molecules which activate the alternative pathway provide binding sites on which C3 breakdown by regulatory proteins is impeded; therefore intact C3b accumulates on the activator. Immunoprecipitation studies with either anti-CR2 or anti-C3 have identified CR2, the R for C3d,g and EBV, as a major covalent and noncovalent binding site for C3 deposition on Raji cells during alternative pathway activation. Covalently bound C3b was dissociated from CR2 by hydroxylamine, indicating attachment via an ester bond. C3b binding after activation was not reduced by an anti-CR2 mAb which blocks CR2 R function, indicating that it was probably not mediated by C3d,g R epitopes on CR2. Direct confirmation of the ability of CR2 to trigger the alternative pathway came from studies with purified CR2 which was found to activate the alternative C pathway in serum or in mixtures of the purified proteins of the pathway. This work provides conclusive evidence that CR2 is a C activator and functions in this capacity on Raji cells.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that animals pharmacologically depleted of C3 have impaired antibody responses. However, such C depletion is neither complete nor sustained, and the C3 cleavage products generated by C3 depletion can both enhance and inhibit the immune response. To clarify the role of C3 in humoral immunity, the antibody response of dogs with genetically determined total deficiency of C3 (C3D) was examined. Serum IgG levels of the C3D animals were within the normal range, but were significantly lower than levels seen in normal controls or C3D heterozygotes. Specific antibody production was defective: the antibody titers of C3D dogs in response to primary intravenous immunization with two different T cell-dependent Ag (sheep E and bacteriophage phi X-174) were markedly reduced when compared to either normal controls or C3D heterozygotes. After secondary immunization with T-dependent Ag, the total antibody titers were normal, but the C3D dogs made proportionately more IgM and less IgG antibody than did either control group. After i.v. immunization with a T cell-independent Ag (DNP-Ficoll), the C3D dogs had reduced levels of IgM and IgG antibody after primary and secondary immunization. Neither i.m. immunization nor the use of a 20-fold increase in Ag dose i.v. could correct the defect seen in the antibody response of C3D dogs. The results herein demonstrate that C3 plays a critical role in the generation of a normal humoral immune response.\r"

  ".W": "The production of histamine-releasing factor (HRF) by human mononuclear cells has previously been reported. In this paper we describe the production of HRF by guinea pig spleen cells, thymocytes, and PBMC. Guinea pig lymphoid cells were cultured either alone or in the presence of mitogens (PHA and Con A) or specific Ag(OVA and keyhole limpet hemocyanin) and the dialyzed cell-free supernatant was tested for histamine-releasing activity on guinea pig lung mast cells and blood basophils. Lung mast cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion and partially purified by countercurrent elutriation and discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation. Guinea pig spleen cells, thymocytes, and PBMC spontaneously produced significant amounts of HRF. The production was enhanced upon stimulation with PHA or specific Ag in animals immunized with Ag in CFA. Two distinct species of HRF were identified with m.w. of 50,000 to 70,000 and 5000 to 8000 by gel chromatography. HRF is a trypsin- and chymotrypsin-sensitive heat-stable protein. It does not bind to Con A-Sepharose and its production is not inhibited by tunicamycin. HRF-induced histamine release from lung mast cells is a temperature-dependent process and is complete in 10 min at 37 degrees C. Intradermal injection of HRF caused an immediate ear-swelling reaction in guinea pigs. The most severe ear-swelling reactions did not resolve within 1 h, but instead evolved over a period of 12 to 24 h.\r"

  ".W": "Three stages of the filarial parasite Brugia malayi (infective third stage larvae, adult worms, and microfilariae) were analyzed for differences in their protein composition by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Comparison of protein profiles of the different stages showed both identical polypeptides (reflecting common proteins) and polypeptides specific for each stage. Three polypeptides present only in infective stage larvae were seen at 72 kDa at an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.98 (p72), 30 kDa at pI 5.5 (p30), and 22 kDa at pI 4.75 (p22). p72 could be labeled chemically with 125I by either chloramine T or IODO-GEN and biosynthetically with [3H]leucine and [35S]methionine during in vitro culture of live larvae; thus, p72 is most likely a surface protein of parasite origin. The antigenic composition of these polypeptides was elucidated by immunoblot analysis. Both p72 and p22 were recognized by hyperimmune rabbit sera to infective larvae; sera from rabbits immunized with adult worms, however, did not recognize any of these Ag. Sera from humans infected with the related Wuchereria bancrofti filaria recognized only p72 and not the other two polypeptides. It therefore appears that p72 is a stage-specific but not genus-specific Ag that is immunogenic in the infected host. p22 also appears to be stage specific and, because it is not recognized by W. bancrofti-infected sera, it may be either a species-specific Ag or a poorly immunogenic molecule of the parasite. With mAb raised to p72, p30, and p22, these proteins were shown to share several antigenic determinants when analyzed by immunoblotting. The shared epitopes were present on numerous molecules with a wide range of apparent m.w. in each of the different parasite stages. Thus, despite the apparent larval stage specificity of these molecules themselves, they must contain certain epitopes shared by molecules from other stages as well. The identification of the p72 polypeptide as a molecule with epitopes exposed on the surface of infective larvae provides a candidate Ag for testing as a protective immunogen.\r"

  ".W": "The variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of the African trypanosome is anchored in the cell membrane by a complex glycan attached to phosphatidylinositol. The carboxyl terminal portion of VSG contains a cryptic carbohydrate epitope, the cross-reacting determinant (CRD), that is revealed only after removal of the diacylglycerol by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) or VSG lipase. Recently, we have shown that after hydrolysis by PIPLC, decay-accelerating factor (DAF)--a mammalian phosphatidylinositol-anchored protein--also contains the CRD epitope. Using a two site immunoradiometric assay in which the capturing antibody is a monoclonal antibody to DAF and the revealing antibody is anti-CRD, we now show that sugar phosphates significantly inhibited the binding of anti-CRD antibody to DAF released by PIPLC. DL-myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate was the most potent inhibitor of binding (IC50 less than 10(-8) M). Other sugar phosphates, such as alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate, which also possess adjacent hydroxyl and phosphate moieties in cis also inhibited binding at low concentrations (IC50 = 10(-5) to 10(-4) M). In contrast, sugar phosphates which do not possess adjacent hydroxyl and phosphate moieties in cis and simple sugars weakly inhibited binding (IC50 greater than 10(-3) M). These results suggest that myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate contributes significantly to the epitope recognized by the anti-CRD antibody and is consistent with analysis of the carboxyl terminus of VSG, which also suggested the presence of the cyclic inositol phosphate. In light of the recent findings that human serum contains a glycan-phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phospholipase D, which converts DAF from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic form lacking the CRD, the observation that the phosphate is crucial for expression of the epitope may be relevant in understanding the origin of CRD-negative DAF in urine and plasma.\r"

  ".W": "We are interested in understanding the effects of virus infection on lymphocyte function. To approach this question, we used a unique system of two genetically related leporipoxviruses to generate recombinants. One of these viruses, malignant fibroma virus (MV), replicates in many different cell types, including lymphocytes. The other, Shope fibroma virus (SFV), replicates principally in fibroblasts, but cannot replicate in lymphocytes. Fibroblasts infected with SFV received restriction fragments from MV by transfection. Recombinant viruses were selected in vitro for their ability to replicate in lymphocytes. By these means we have identified one restriction fragment, the 10.8-kb BamHI \"C\" fragment, capable of transferring from MV to SFV the ability to replicate in lymphocytes. A family of recombinants bearing different sized inserts of this restriction fragment has been isolated and is being characterized. Lymphocytotropic recombinants bearing portions of this restriction fragment produce colony morphology in vitro intermediate between MV's plaques and SFV's foci. On the basis of their ability to grow in and suppress mitogen responsiveness of lymphocytes, these recombinants may be classified into four different groups. Group 1 viruses are the most immunosuppressive, whereas those of group 4 are least. These traits correlate with ability to replicate in lymphocytes. Genetic analysis of recombinants indicates that the most immunosuppressive recombinants do not necessarily contain the most fragment C DNA. Therefore, we have identified a restriction fragment, one or more of the genes of which are sufficient to allow an otherwise nonlymphocytotropic virus to replicate in lymphocytes. Additional genetic and immunologic analysis should permit us to determine the structure and function of the protein responsible for this effect.\r"

The induction on MHC antigen expression potentially allows immunocytes to interact with infected glial cells and may play a critical role in the development of virus-induced, immune-mediated demyelination in the central nervous system, a possible model of human multiple sclerosis. In this study, we characterized the soluble factor involved in MHC antigen induction, quantitated induction of MHC antigens, and analyzed the central nervous system cell type involved in the production of the factor. The H-2-inducing factor, most likely produced by astrocytes, was found to be nondialyzable, heat- and trypsin-sensitive, but resistant to treatment at pH 2.0. The m.w. of the factor was estimated as 50 to 100 kDa. Studies on fractionation by ultrafiltration and sucrose density gradient along with antibody-blocking experiments indicate that the factor is not interferon or virus particles.\r"

Dose-response study in vitro of singlet oxygen production in H2O and D2O and inhibition studies involving the production of singlet oxygen and superoxide anion by specific quenchers indicated significant production of singlet oxygen by porphyrins, about 5-20 times higher than psoralen at 10(-5) M and 10(-6) M concentration and irradiation dose of 1-5 J/cm2 of UVA (greater than 320-400 nm radiation). The comparative studies on aerobic photodegradation of microsomal P-450 of guinea pig epidermis and liver indicated a significantly greater destruction of P-450 with porphyrins than with psoralens. A membrane-lipid peroxidation study involving malondialdehyde production, using liver and epidermal microsomal fractions with and without porphyrins, psoralens, and UVA radiation, indicated 10-20 times increased production of malondialdehyde with UVA and porphyrins than with psoralens.\r"

Cultures and cocultures of epithelial BMC-producing cells (L2 or PER cells) and fibroblasts were prepared in several experimental conditions and the organization of BMCs was studied by immunofluorescence. The pattern of BMCs in pure cultures of L2 or pulmonary epithelial rat (PER) cells consisted of intra- and extracellular granular deposits. At very high density, the cell contours were also underlined by a disrupted network of BMC deposits. A different fibrillar plexus--containing laminin, collagen type IV, and heparan-sulfate proteoglycan resistant to deoxycholate treatment and distant from the cell membrane--was observed in cocultures of L2 or PER cells with fibroblasts. Fibrils of fibronectin and/or collagen type I were most often dissociated from this plexus of BMCs. Similar results were obtained by adding a conditioned medium of L2 or PER cells to confluent fibroblasts, even when the cells were killed. Pure laminin also bound to the fibroblast layer. A coated film of fibronectin or polymeric collagen type I was unable to bind BMC provided by a conditioned medium. It is suggested that molecule(s) synthesized by fibroblasts and deposited in the pericellular matrix are involved in the assembly of BMCs.\r"

Its exact location within the cell has yet to be determined. In this study we report the expression of SSA/Ro antigen in simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed keratinocytes. The locations of SSA/Ro, U1RNP, and DNA antigens were studied by indirect immunofluorescence using monospecific antibodies. SSA/Ro antigen was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of SV40-transformed keratinocytes tested with three monospecific sera. Primary cultured keratinocytes derived from adult human skin showed localized immunofluorescent staining within the nucleus. When Ca++ concentration of the medium was switched to 0.05 mM, these cells expressed cytoplasmic SSA/Ro antigens within 48 h. Depletion of the antibody activity with insolubilized human spleen extract abolished the staining. Surface expression of this antigen could not be detected in either primary or transformed cells. Localization of U1RNP and DNA was not altered. These results indicate that expression of SSA/Ro antigen in human keratinocytes is modulated by SV40 infection and that this antigen is expressed to a greater degree in cells that are less differentiated, transformed, or proliferating.\r"

In the same cell type from rats, however, there is hardly any removal of such dimers. To investigate whether this low capacity of rat skin cells to repair lesions in their DNA is an inherent characteristic of this species or an artifact due to cell culturing, we measured the removal of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers from rat epidermal keratinocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Epidermal keratinocytes in vitro were unable to remove any dimers over the first 3 h after UV-irradiation, while only about 20% was removed during a repair period of 24 h. In this respect, these cells were not different from cultured rat fibroblasts. In contrast to the results obtained with keratinocytes in vitro, we observed a rapid repair of pyrimidine dimers in UV-irradiated keratinocytes in vivo over the first 3 h; this rapid repair phase was followed by a much slower repair phase between 3 and 24 h. These results are discussed in terms of the possibility that mammalian cells are able to switch from one DNA repair pathway to another.\r"

Six series of ceramides were found in each sample, the relative amounts of which were determined by thin-layer chromatography/photodensitometry. Acylceramides (ceramide 1) were isolated by preparative thin-layer chromatography and their ester-linked fatty acids were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. The comedonal acylceramides contained higher proportions of 16:0, 16:1 delta 6, and 18:1 delta 6 + delta 8 and much less linoleate (18:2 delta 9,12) than the acylceramides from the skin surface. In the surface lipids from legs, acylceramides from the acne patients contained less linoleate than the acylceramides from control subjects. Free fatty acids from the comedones were also isolated and analyzed, and had a composition very similar to the esterified fatty acids of comedonal acylceramides. The results confirm that fatty acids derived from sebum become incorporated into comedonal acylceramides, displacing linoleate, and show that this process even affects the acylceramides of surface epidermis, more so in acne patients than in normal subjects.\r"

A single application of 1 microgram of TCDD did not stimulate significant ornithine decarboxylase activity in the skin in either strain. Other than a reduction in the density of the inflammatory cell infiltrate in the dermis, topical treatment with antiinflammatory agents fluocinolone acetonide and indomethacin did not affect the cutaneous response to TCDD. Skin of newborn mice treated topically with TCDD over a 2-wk period reacted much the same as adult skin in that sebaceous glands were reduced in size and TG activity was stimulated in both haired and hairless neonates; but epidermal hyperplasia occurred only in the hairless, not the haired newborns.\r"

  ".W": "A single exposure to 254 nm ultraviolet irradiation (UV) can systemically suppress experimental sensitization to the simple allergen 2,4-dinitro, 1-chlorobenzene (DNCB) in the mouse. We show here that topical application at the site of irradiation of the 21-oic acid methyl ester derivative of the synthetic glucocorticoid triamcinolone acetonide (TAme) prevents UV suppression of sensitization. That is, mice painted with TAme at the site of UV exposure developed normal contact hypersensitivity (CH); mice exposed to UV only, like mice treated with the parent compound triamcinolone acetonide (TA), failed to be sensitized by DNCB applied to a distal site. TAme is inactivated rapidly by plasma esterases, so its effect is thought to be confined to the skin. Apparently, TAme blocked the cutaneous signal(s) for systemic suppression of CH. Histologically, irradiated skin exhibited mild inflammation and hyperproliferation, but these effects were greatly exaggerated and prolonged in the UV + TAme-treated skin, independent of sensitization at the distal site. The infiltrate consisted mostly of neutrophils and lacked the round cells characteristic of cell-mediated immunity. Apparently, normal immune suppression by UV prevented this vigorous reaction to irradiated skin. Applied together with DNCB. TAme blocked sensitization. It also prevented response to challenge by DNCB in previously sensitized animals. However, unlike the parent compound triamcinolone acetonide (TA), Budesonide or Beclomethasone diproprionate, each of which can penetrate the epidermis in active form, TAme had no effect on sensitization when applied at a distal site. Likewise, TAme did not affect plasma B (17-desoxycortisol) levels, whereas the other three compounds reduced plasma B tenfold, as expected of compounds causing adrenal-pituitary suppression. The results as a whole show that glucocorticoids can specifically inhibit cutaneous steps in induction of cell-mediated immunity or its suppression, and can, at the site of challenge, prevent its expression in CH.\r"

In normal individuals, the levels of TR activity in skin correlate linearly to the Fitzpatrick classification of skin type, being lowest in type I skin and highest in skin type VI. In this study, TR was measured in 3-mm skin biopsies in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) patients and their relatives. Forty-five individuals from seven Puerto Rican kindreds were tested, including 12 homozygotes, nine obligate heterozygotes, and 24 unclassified individuals. In addition, seven separate nonkindred HPS patients were tested. With one exception, TR activity was markedly decreased in 18 homozygotes. TR activity was decreased in eight obligate heterozygotes and in 12 unclassified kindred members, whereas 10 subjects had normal TR activity when compared to the expected activity of their skin type. Four individuals were excluded from the analysis because of inadequate controls for their age group or immunosuppressive treatment for kidney transplant. The results indicate that decreased TR activity assayed in 3-mm skin punch biopsies is a useful method for detecting carriers of the HPS gene.\r"

  ".W": "Psoriatic epidermis is characterized by increased DNA synthesis and disturbed differentiation. Even though these processes are closely associated, most investigations do not give insight into temporal/spatial relationships between both events. We previously developed a double labeling method for the simultaneous demonstration of the germinative and differentiated epidermal compartments in normal human skin by using tritium-labeled thymidine ([3H] Thd) incorporation and immunoperoxidase staining of 67 kD keratin polypeptides. In this paper we report the results of combined evaluation of these compartments in stable plaques of psoriasis. Scanning of skin sections with an automatic image analyzer allows objective quantification of areas of total epidermis, 67 kD+ differentiated epidermis and numbers of [3H] Thdr+ nuclei. Our data indicate that the 67 kD- undifferentiated psoriatic epidermis is expanded. Increased numbers of [3H] Thd+ basal and suprabasal psoriatic keratinocytes are present and most of them (97.9%) pertain to the 67 kD- compartment. Keratin identification in scales taken from the same sites showed a variable but distinct decrease of 67 kD keratin polypeptides. Hence, the hyperplastic epidermis of stable plaques of psoriasis is characterized by the presence of increased numbers of [3H] Thd+ cells, which primarily belong to the undifferentiated (67 kD-) basal and suprabasal compartments, especially in the lowermost parts of the elongated interpapillary rete ridges. These changes are associated with a relative decrease of synthesis of 67 kD polypeptides and the presence in the scales of keratins that confer a characteristic hyperproliferative epidermal keratin pattern to the psoriatic plaque.\r"

Dilated vascular channels and mast cell hypoplasia characterized lesional skin before treatment. Immediately after treatment, widespread selective vessel necrosis, similar to changes previously described, was observed. One year after laser irradiation, the abnormally ectatic portwine stain vessels had been replaced by small venules and arterioles, similar in number and diameter to blood vessels in normal skin; the only difference noted was that these new vessels were surrounded by easily identifiable mast cells. Many of these mast cells exhibited evidence of activation and degranulation. We conclude that mast cells may play an important role in the neovascularization of portwine stains treated by 577-nm dye laser irradiation.\r"

Reported here are experiments testing the angiogenic properties of the growing (anagen) hair follicle. Using the rabbit corneal pocket angiogenesis assay and cycled anagen rat vibrissae hair follicles, we found that the mesenchymal dermal papilla had no angiogenic properties, but the anagen bulb was angiogenic. These findings suggest a mechanism for the cycling of hair follicles and an example of normal epithelium to mesenchyme interactions.\r"

The specificity of this staining was confirmed by hyaluronidase predigestion and by hyaluronate-derived oligosaccharides added to the staining solution. All dermis showed diffuse binding of the probe, but the highest staining intensity was observed in the epidermal intercellular spaces. The stainability extended from basal cells to the middle layers of the epidermis, whereas the granular layer and stratum corneum were completely negative. Also, the basal side of basal cells (basement membrane) did not bind the hyaluronate probe. The abundance of hyaluronate on surfaces and intercellular spaces of the spinous cells is suggested to have an important role in the physiology of human epidermis.\r"
