  ".U": "89199442\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the role of host susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, we studied subsequent seroconversion in 161 individuals, initially seronegative to HIV-1, who underwent skin testing for cutaneous anergy at an index visit within a prospective study of homosexual men. There were 23 seroconversions in these men by 45 months following the skin testing, yielding a crude rate of seroconversion of 14.3%. While results of purified protein derivative (PPD), Candida, and Trichophyton skin tests were not associated with subsequent course, anergy to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) was predictive of subsequent seroconversion. Kaplan-Meier estimates for the risk of seroconversion during 45 months of follow-up in those men initially anergic and reactive to DNCB were 28.9 and 11.1%, respectively, yielding a relative risk of 2.6 (p = 0.006). The estimated relative risk was stable with adjustment by Cox regression for annual number of male sexual partners and frequency of receptive anal intercourse, and was not sensitive to various changes in the definition of seroconversion time and of eligibility criteria. These data suggest that an impaired host immune status may be associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 infection that is independent of risk of exposure to the virus, supporting earlier speculations that HIV-1 may itself be opportunistic. The notion of varying host susceptibility to infection, at least with regard to sexual transmission in homosexual men, may help to explain the frequent observation of individuals who have been repeatedly exposed to the virus and yet have remained uninfected.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to examine the risks of HIV transmission from artificial insemination in a sample of lesbians residing in California and inseminated between 1979 and 1987. This population was selected because lesbians are considered to be at low risk for HIV infection, and have traditionally used semen from men engaging in high-risk behaviors, namely, homosexual men. Each of the 98 participants had blood drawn for the HIV antibody test (ELISA) and completed a questionnaire inquiring about her sexual, health, and reproductive history, including detailed information about her inseminations (e.g., vaginal vs. uterine, fresh vs. frozen semen, sexual orientation, and antibody status of donor). One-half of the women had homosexual or bisexual donors, many of whom resided in the San Francisco Bay area; most of these inseminations were with fresh semen. The women reported a marked decline in the use of homosexual donors after 1982 and a corresponding increase in the use of donations from sperm banks and health practitioners. Based on the women's reports, as many as 11 women may have received semen from an infected donor. However, none of the 98 women tested seropositive. We attribute our negative findings to the change to low-risk donors in the years when HIV became more prevalent in the population, and to the potentially lower rates of infectivity with artificial insemination than with heterosexual intercourse. Nevertheless, we recommend that women continue to follow the CDC guidelines for screening donors prior to artificial insemination.\r"

Viral suspensions of HSV-1 (10(8) TCD50/ml), HIV-1 (10(5) TCD50/ml), and echovirus type 9 (10(7.5)TCD 50/ml) were placed in an inverted glove finger immersed in media and maintained for 3 h at room temperature with sampling performed from outside the glove at 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h. No cytopathic effect (CPE) was identified after inoculation onto Vero cells or RhMK cells for HSV-1 and Echo 9, respectively, and reverse transcriptase activity was not detected in Hut 78 cells after inoculation of HIV-1 during any of the time intervals. Stretching of a glove finger for 18 h with repetition of the procedure with Echo 9 revealed no CPE. We conclude that under these experimental conditions, intact gloves act as effective barriers to the transmission of viral particles, including HIV in the health care setting.\r"

  ".U": "89199455\r", 
  ".W": "Amphetamine and cocaine, commonly abused psychostimulants, often produce similar physiologic and behavioral effects in both animals and humans. We have shown previously that the reinforcing effects of cocaine can be correlated with drug binding to the mazindol and GBR 12935 binding sites on the dopamine transporter. In an attempt to identify the receptors associated with the reinforcing properties of amphetamine and related phenylethylamines, we have compared the potencies of these compounds in studies of drug reinforced behavior with their binding potencies at monoaminergic uptake sites and neurotransmitter receptor sites. The results of these experiments indicate that d-amphetamine exhibits a pharmacologically relevant micromolar affinity for dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin uptake sites as well as for alpha-2 adrenergic receptor sites. Analysis of the data indicates that the reinforcing effects of phenylethylamines were not positively correlated with inhibition of ligand binding to any of the monoamine sites tested. However, the self-administration of amphetamine and related compounds may be inversely related to the inhibition of [3H]paroxetine binding to the serotonin transporter, suggesting that serotonin uptake inhibition opposes the reinforcing effects of amphetamine. This effect is not related to direct effects of drug binding at 5-HT2 receptor sites. Finally, amphetamine binding to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors suggests that these receptors could play a role in mediating the releasing or uptake inhibiting properties of the drug, and perhaps a role in some of its psychotomimetic effects.\r"

After i.t. administration, none of the four compounds increased the withdrawal latency in the tail-flick test. With the intradermal hypertonic saline (6% saline) behavioral test, baclofen decreased the number of behaviors in a dose-dependent and 5-aminovaleric acid-reversible manner, whereas i.t. administered muscimol was ineffective. With the i.t. substance P (SP) behavioral test, muscimol was again ineffective, whereas the SP-induced behaviors were differentially modified by baclofen depending on the temporal order of their i.t. administration. Although baclofen, coadministered with SP, decreased the number of SP-induced behaviors, baclofen pretreatment (2-100 min before i.t. administration of SP) increased the number of behaviors in a dose-dependent and 5-aminovaleric acid-reversible manner. Two minutes after several fixed doses of baclofen were administered i.t., dose-response curves for induction of behaviors by SP (i.t.) were shifted progressively to the left by increasing doses of baclofen, suggesting that hypersensitivity to SP had developed during this time frame. Decreased responsiveness to a peripheral noxious stimulus (hypertonic saline-induced behavior) is therefore associated with hypersensitivity to i.t. applied SP (SP behavioral test). The selective action of a GABAB agonist on neurokinin-elicited behaviors shown in this study is in clear contrast to the selective action of a GABA agonist against excitatory amino acid spinal activity noted in the following paper.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to investigate opioid peptide-mediated changes in renal function in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats after administration of the native opioid agonist methionine enkephalin (ME), its synthetic analog D-Ala2-methionine enkephalinamide (DALA) and the opioid antagonist naloxone. Intravenous infusion of DALA (25 micrograms/kg/min) and ME (75 micrograms/kg/min) produced no changes in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow in rats with intact or bilaterally denervated kidneys. In contrast, i.v. infusion of these opioid agonists produced differing effects on the renal excretion of water and sodium; DALA produced an increase in urinary flow rate and sodium excretion and ME produced a decrease in these parameters. Changes in renal sympathetic nerve activity were not involved in producing these effects as supported by measurements of renal sympathetic nerve activity and the finding that prior bilateral renal denervation did not alter the renal responses to either agonist. The renal excretory responses to both DALA and ME infusion were prevented by pretreatment with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, thus suggesting an opioid receptor-mediated effect of both agonists. Intravenous bolus injections of naloxone alone produced a dose-dependent diuresis and natriuresis without producing changes in systemic or renal hemodynamics or renal sympathetic nerve activity. These studies, therefore, provide evidence that the administration of opioid receptor agonists and antagonists produce changes in the renal excretion of water and sodium via an action on renal tubular reabsorptive mechanisms which are independent of changes in systemic or renal hemodynamics or renal sympathetic nerve activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study details differences among species with regard to muscarinic, adrenergic, histaminergic and serotonergic agonists in the bladder body, bladder neck and prostate from guinea pig, rat and cat. Under in vitro conditions, all smooth muscle preparations contracted to potassium chloride. The muscarinic agonist, carbamylcholine, produced maximal contraction, whereas alpha receptor agonists exerted only minimal, if any, effect in bladder body preparations from all three species. In contrast, alpha receptor-mediated responses predominated relative to muscarinic responses in bladder neck preparations from all three species. Prostatic contractility was examined in tissue from guinea pig and rat and contraction occurred to both alpha and muscarinic receptor agonists. Contractile response to norepinephrine in bladder neck and prostate was potentiated by neuronal uptake inhibition but not by beta receptor blockade. Serotonin and histamine exhibited more diverse effects among species and tissues. In general, histamine contracted all three tissues from guinea pig with minimal contraction occurring in tissues from rat or cat. On the other hand, serotonin markedly contracted the cat bladder body and rat prostate, but exerted no effect on tissues from the guinea pig. These data reinforce and detail the heterogeneity of pharmacologic contractile responses in lower urinary tract smooth muscle. Furthermore, the studies document the relative similarity among species in cholinergic and adrenergic responsiveness and the dissimilarity among species in serotonergic and histaminergic responsiveness of lower urinary tract smooth muscle.\r"

AA-GS is excreted into bile, therefore the biliary excretion rate of AA-GS may reflect the rate of activation of AA in vivo. In order to test this hypothesis, the effect of agents capable of altering the activation of AA including cytochrome P-450 inducers and inhibitors, cobaltous chloride which decreases the amount of P-450, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (indomethacin and naproxen), antioxidants (butylated hydroxyanisole, alpha-tocopherol, ascorbic acid and ascorbic acid palmitate) and other chemicals known to decrease AA hepatotoxicity (dimethylsulfoxide and cysteamine), on the biliary excretion of AA-GS was studied in hamsters, the species most sensitive to AA-induced hepatotoxicity. The biliary excretion of AA-GS increased linearly up to 1 mmol/kg of AA i.v., but at higher dosages exhibited saturation kinetics. Dosages above 0.5 mmol/kg lowered hepatic GS concentration. Of the cytochrome P-450 inducers, 3-methylcholanthrene and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, increased the biliary excretion of AA-GS (2.9- and 3.2-fold, respectively) whereas ethanol and isoniazid did not affect it, and pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile tended to decrease it (43%). Phenobarbital tended to increase the biliary excretion of AA-GS, but not in a statistically significant manner. Several cytochrome P-450 inhibitors [metyrapone, 8-methoxypsoralen, 2-(4,6-dichloro-biphenyloxy) ethylamine, alpha-naphthoflavone and cimetidine] decreased the biliary excretion of AA-GS, although SKF 525-A and piperonyl butoxide did not. Cobaltous chloride decreased dramatically the biliary excretion of AA-GS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "2-Brom-d-lysergic acid diethylamide (BOL) appeared to behave as either a reversible competitive or noncompetitive antagonist of vascular serotonergic (5-HT2) receptors depending on experimental conditions. This was explored using rabbit thoracic aorta rings mounted in tissue baths for the measurement of isometric contraction. BOL caused concentration-dependent parallel rightward shifts of the 5-HT dose-response curve in untreated aortas but, in addition, caused a marked reduction of maximal response in aortas pretreated with benextramine to inactivate alpha adrenoceptors. Ketanserin behaved as a reversible competitive antagonist in both untreated and benextramine-pretreated aortas. The respective ketanserin pA2 values were 9.08 +/- 0.09 (S.E.M.) and 9.01 +/- 0.04. Ketanserin, 1 x 10(-7) M, reversed completely the reduction of maximal response caused by 1 x 10(-9) M BOL and partially reversed those caused by 1 x 10(-8) and 1 x 10(-7) M BOL. Furthermore, the 5-HT dose-response curve in the presence of 1 x 10(-7) M ketanserin and that in the presence of 1 x 10(-7) M ketanserin plus 1 x 10(-9) M BOL were superimposed. These results are consistent with the conclusion that BOL is a noncompetitive 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. We propose that BOL acts at an allosteric site to convert the 5-HT2 receptor to a low activity state, thus, reducing the maximal response. BOL does not act at the 5-HT2 receptor itself. Ketanserin competes with 5-HT at the 5-HT2 receptor and with BOL at the allosteric site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Doses of bremazocine (0.001-0.003 mg/kg), U50,488 (0.03-0.1 mg/kg) and Mr2266 (1.0-3.0 mg/kg) that markedly increased overall rates of FI responding maintained by stimulus-shock termination had little effect on or only decreased overall rates of FI responding maintained by food presentation. Each of the kappa opioids decreased FR responding maintained by either consequence. Morphine (0.03-1.7 mg/kg) only decreased responding under all conditions. Pretreatment with Mr2266 (0.1 mg/kg) produced a 10-fold or more rightward shift in the dose-effect functions for morphine under the two multiple schedules and U50,488 under the multiple schedule of food presentation. A 3-fold higher dose of Mr2266 produced an approximately 10-fold rightward shift in the descending portion of the dose-effect functions for U50,488 and bremazocine under the schedule of stimulus-shock termination but did not appreciably alter their rate-increasing effects. Naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg) antagonized the effects of selected doses of morphine or bremazocine on overall rates of responding under the schedule of stimulus-shock termination. In contrast to its effects in combination with morphine, however, naltrexone (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) did not block alterations in patterns of FI responding produced by bremazocine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The activities of two structurally unrelated thromboxane/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonists, SQ 30,741 and BM 13,505, were compared to heparin in a model of venous thrombosis. A combination of blood stasis with osmotic and pressure stress was used to induce thrombus formation in the vena cava of anesthetized rats. Intravenous infusions of SQ 30,741 (500 micrograms/kg/min) and BM 13,505 (50 micrograms/kg/min) produced significant (P less than .01) and equivalent reductions in thrombus mass of 58 and 56%, respectively. Thrombus reduction in response to heparin (50 U/kg) was greater (95%; P less than .001) than in response to the thromboxane antagonists. Either lower doses of SQ 30,741 (50 and 100 micrograms/kg/min) or aspirin (30 and 60 mg/kg) were ineffective in altering thrombus formation. However, a subthreshold dose of SQ 30,741 (100 micrograms/kg/min) increased (P less than .01) the antithrombotic activity obtained with both threshold (0.5 U/kg) and subthreshold (0.3 U/kg) doses of heparin. SQ 30,741 (500 micrograms/kg/min) did not change activated partial thromboplastin times or inhibit platelet loss induced by contact activation in response to kaolin in vivo. This suggests that SQ 30,741 does not interfere with components of the coagulation cascade that are not dependent on platelet factors. The extent of thromboxane antagonism achieved with SQ 30,741 (50 and 500 micrograms/kg/min) and BM 13,505 (50 micrograms/kg/min) was determined from parallel shifts in dose-dependent U-46,619-induced vasoconstriction in vivo (approximately 200- and 1300-fold, respectively, for SQ 30,741 and 200-fold for BM 13,505). These data demonstrate that thromboxane antagonists inhibit venous thrombosis partially, but only at doses producing near complete receptor inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The competition of NMS for [3H]QNB demonstrated that NMS discriminates multiple muscarinic binding sites. Similarly, pirenzepine competition of [3H]QNB binding also revealed multiple muscarinic binding sites. Pirenzepine competition for [3H]NMS also was shallow and demonstrated the presence of binding sites with similar affinities to those labeled by [3H]QNB. These data were consistent with the presence of at least three populations of muscarinic binding sites with similar affinities for [3H]QNB: the M1 and M2 binding sites having high and low affinity for pirenzepine, respectively, but which cannot be discriminated by [3H]NMS, and a third site with high affinity for [3H]QNB which has low affinity for NMS. The classical muscarinic antagonists, atropine and scopolamine, also appear to have slightly different affinities for the putative M1 and M2 binding sites. The use of the irreversible antagonists, N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) and propylbenzilylcholine mustard (PBCM), were used to elucidate the distinct properties of these multiple muscarinic binding sites. Both PBCM and EEDQ irreversibly decreased the Bmax of [3H]QNB and [3H]NMS binding in cortex. PBCM did not appear to discriminate putative M1 and M2 binding sites but selectively alkylated the high affinity NMS and QNB binding sites. In contrast, EEDQ modified the low affinity NMS binding sites such that they still bound [3H]QNB but their affinity for other muscarinic antagonists was reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that intrarenal infusions of hypertonic saline induce endogenous release of adenosine to result in renal vasoconstriction has been investigated in salt-deplete dogs using the nonxanthine adenosine receptor antagonist, CGS 15943A. Intrarenal artery infusions of CGS 15943A induced dose-dependent reductions in the renal vasoconstrictor response to bolus doses of adenosine into the renal artery, without altering base-line blood pressure or renal blood flow. Infusion rates of 10 micrograms/min induced an approximate 50% reduction in response, whereas 100 micrograms/min produced a substantially greater response. There was no inhibition of the renal vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin II and norepinephrine by CGS 15943A at a rate of 100 micrograms/min. Changes in RBF after intrarenal infusion of hypertonic saline were compared between further series of salt-deplete dogs receiving intrarenal artery infusions of either vehicle or CGS 15943A (100 micrograms/min). An initial infusion of hypertonic saline to both groups of dogs induced renal vasodilation followed by vasoconstriction. In dogs subsequently infused with CGS 15943A (100 micrograms/min), the initial renal vasodilation response was similar, but there was an abolition of the later vasoconstrictor response. In contrast, the renal blood flow response to hypertonic saline was unchanged in the vehicle-infused dogs. We conclude that CGS 15943A can selectively block the renal blood flow response to exogenous adenosine without altering baseline renal vascular tone and that the ability of CGS 15943A to abolish the renal vasoconstrictor response to intrarenal hypertonic saline is consistent with the hypothesis that endogenous release of adenosine is involved in mediating the reduction in renal blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of conjugation and side chain length on dihydroxy bile acid unidirectional hepatic uptake and efflux was studied using the isolated perfused rat liver which was perfused prograde or retrograde in single pass fashion. Deoxycholic acid (DC) and its C23 (nor) derivative nor-DC, as well as the synthetically prepared taurine conjugate of DC, were administered at a constant dose of 1 mumol/min/kg (body weight), upon which a bolus tracer dose of labeled bile acid was superimposed. Analysis of radioactivity recovery in perfusate indicated that unidirectional uptake of all three bile acids was equally rapid, but that only nor-DC showed considerable and continuing efflux into the perfusate; this involved mostly the unchanged acid. Nor-DC was not amidated but was metabolized to mostly ester glucuronides and hydroxylated derivatives; the biotransformation products did not reflux and were secreted into bile; similarly, DC was amidated with taurine; its taurine conjugate did not efflux and was secreted into bile. When nor-DC-taurine was infused, it did not efflux and was secreted rapidly into bile. When the liver was perfused retrograde fashion to increase concentrations of bile acids pericentral cells, only nor-DC showed efflux, which again involved only the unchanged acid. All bile acids were partly 7 alpha-hydroxylated, the magnitude being greater during retrograde perfusion presumably because slower cellular transport exposed bile acid to hydroxylation enzymes for a longer period. It is concluded that bile acid conjugation, whether by esterification with CoA formation adn subsequent amidation or by esterification with glucuronate, restricts the movement of lipophilic dihydroxy bile acids to the hepatocyte and canalicular lumen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ethacizin is a phenothiazine derivative antiarrhythmic agent that blocks sodium current. The cell-attached patch clamp of single adult rat ventricular cells was used to investigate mechanisms of use-dependent block of sodium current. Under control conditions peak open probability, first latency, fraction of null sweeps, mean open time and single channel current amplitude were not different at both 1 and 4 Hz. Ethacizin (5 microM) caused a significant decrease in the peak open probability, a significant increase in the first latency and an increase in the fraction of null sweeps at 4 Hz compared with 1 Hz; mean open time and single channel current amplitude were unchanged. These observations support a model of antiarrhythmic action which proposes complete block of single channel conductance resulting from drug binding. A \"runs analysis\" revealed nonrandom clustering of null traces in the presence of ethacizin and no clustering in control patches. Increasing stimulation frequency makes this nonrandom behavior more apparent. We conclude that the relatively slow cycling of a few channels between blocked and unblocked states induces null sweeps clustering. The implications of these findings for mechanisms of drug block of the Na channel are discussed.\r"

In the first phase of the investigation, a dose run-up of methocarbamol (up to 12 g) was conducted in six subjects to determine appropriate doses. In the second phase, a randomized block cross-over study using 14 subjects was conducted. The following drug conditions were tested in the cross-over phase: placebo, lorazepam 1, 2 and 4 mg, and methocarbamol 2.25, 4.5 and 9 g. Drug conditions were tested under double-blind conditions. Psychomotor and cognitive performance measures and subject- and observer-rated behavioral responses were measured daily before dosing and for 5.5 hr after drug administration. The results showed that both lorazepam and methocarbamol produced statistically significant dose-related increases in subjects' ratings of drug effect and liking, although only lorazepam increased morphine-benzedrine group (MGB) scale scores. Methocarbamol also increased ratings on measures indicating the emergence of dysphoric and other side effects at high doses. Both drugs impaired psychomotor and cognitive performance, with lorazepam generally producing greater effects than methocarbamol. The results indicate that methocarbamol, at doses well above those used therapeutically, has some potential to be abused by persons with histories of sedative/hypnotic abuse; however, this potential for abuse is probably decreased by the accompanying side effects at high doses and is probably less than that of lorazepam.\r"

Exposure of bovine aortic smooth muscle cells to 0.25 to 25 microM terbinafine resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of PDGF-induced mitogenesis as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA or cell number. The IC50 for inhibition of PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle cell DNA synthesis was approximately 5 microM. Micromolar concentrations of terbinafine also suppressed the mitogenic response to PDGF in fibroblasts. Neither the binding of [125I]PDGF to its plasma membrane receptors nor the uptake of [3H]thymidine or [3H]uridine was affected significantly by terbinafine. Oral administration of terbinafine (200 mg/kg/day) to rats for 2 days before and 14 days after balloon catheter injury to the carotid artery was associated with a 40% decrease in the area of the neointimal lesion. These observations indicate that terbinafine is both a potent in vitro antagonist of the smooth muscle cell mitogenic response to PDGF and an effective, well-tolerated p.o. active inhibitor of neointimal proliferation in vivo.\r"

Recently, indomethacin was shown not to affect the natriuretic response to the new loop diuretic torasemide in healthy volunteers. Inasmuch as sodium balance has been reported to modify the effect of indomethacin on furosemide-induced natriuresis in dogs, we investigated the effect of indomethacin, under two sodium balances (50 and 150 mEq/day), on the natriuretic response to two doses of torasemide in six healthy volunteers. Under the low sodium diet, indomethacin reduced the natriuretic response to torasemide like that to furosemide. In contrast, on the normal sodium diet, indomethacin failed to affect the natriuretic response to torasemide. Indomethacin reduced base-line and diuretic-induced increase in plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II levels and urinary excretion of prostaglandin 6-keto F1 alpha to a similar extent under the two sodium diets. Our data show that indomethacin reduces the natriuretic response to torasemide in humans. Dietary sodium restriction is a significant determinant of the interaction between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and loop diuretics in healthy volunteers, presumably because it allows loop diuretics to provoke an increase in renal blood flow which participates in their natriuretic action and is blocked by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\r"

Sodium excretion rates and fractional sodium excretions (FENa) percentages were correlated significantly with dose and with urinary excretion rates of furosemide. The ED50 was below 5 mg and no additional natriuretic effect was seen above 40 mg. The efficiency (FENa percentage per microgram of furosemide excreted per minute during a certain clearance period) was dependent on hydration and on time. For the period 15 to 30 min a significant linear relationship between furosemide dose and the reciprocal of the efficiency indicated a higher efficiency for lower doses and a theoretical maximal value of FENa of 0.4% per micrograms of furosemide excreted per minute. A relative value for a dose-dependent efficiency reduction was calculated for each dose. The ED50 for dose-dependent efficiency reduction was about 12 mg i.v. Simultaneous measurements of lithium clearance indicated a proximal site of action for furosemide which was saturated at furosemide excretion rates above 50 micrograms/minute. For the major, distal, site of action no maximal value was demonstrated. It is concluded that a wanted balance between a strong natriuretic effect and weak sodium retaining mechanism not necessarily is achieved by a high dose and that information concerning that problem must be obtained from studies in relevant patient groups.\r"

The Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchange regulates pHi back to normal after alkalinization and is therefore in a state of high activity at alkaline pHi, whereas it is in a state of low activity when pHi is below neutrality. Preincubation with the drugs at low pH strongly increased the activity of the Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchange, whereas at high pH the antiport was inhibited. The Na+-dependent Cl-/HCO3- exchange, which is most active at low pHi and normalize pHi after acidification, was inhibited after preincubation with the drugs. In cells that had been incubated with the drugs, pHi was 0.1 to 0.4 pH units lower than in cells that had been incubated in the absence of drugs. The prostaglandins E2, F2 and I2 had little effect on anion antiport, and did not counteract the effects of the anti-inflammatory drugs on Cl-/HCO3- exchange, indicating that these actions of the drugs are not due to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The relevance of our findings to the clinical effects of these drugs is discussed.\r"

For this purpose, 600 microspheres (48 microns in diameter) were injected into the right carotid canal of rats, which induced an irreversible embolism in the right cerebrum. Three days after the operation, the cerebral mitochondria were isolated and their oxidative phosphorylation ability and succinate dehydrogenase activity were determined. Two types of mitochondria were obtained after cerebral embolism: one was mitochondria which revealed a marked decline in the oxidative phosphorylation activity when measured in the presence of glutamate or succinate as a substrate (severely injured mitochondria), and the other, those which revealed a decrease in the activity in the presence of succinate and an appreciable increase in the activity in the presence of glutamate (mildly injured mitochondria). Naftidrofuryl at the concentration of 3 microM elicited slight but significant restoration of the oxidative phosphorylation ability of the mildly injured mitochondria isolated from rats after the cerebral embolism, but not of the severely injured mitochondria. The succinate dehydrogenase activity of the brain mitochondria isolated from rats 3 days after the cerebral embolism was significantly decreased. Exposure of these mitochondria to 0.1 to 1 microM Naftidrofuryl significantly restored the succinate dehydrogenase activity. The results suggest that Naftidrofuryl is capable of exerting a beneficial effect in vitro on the brain mitochondria activity impaired by the cerebral embolism, particularly on the activity of mildly injured mitochondria.\r"

In vitro binding assays with rat brain membranes revealed that CM 57493 bound to 5-HT1A sites in a concentration range (pIC50 = 7.1) at least two orders of magnitude lower than that required for its interaction with 5-HT1B/5-HT1D, 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HTPre sites. The affinity of CM 57493 for 5-HT1A sites labeled by [3H]-8-OH-DPAT in hippocampal membranes was enhanced by Mn++ and reduced by GTP, as expected for an agonist. Like 8-OH-DPAT, CM 57493 inhibited forskolin-activated adenylate cyclase activity in hippocampal homogenates. The inhibitory effects of these two compounds were not additive and were prevented by 5-HT1A antagonists such as spiperone and dl-propranolol. In vivo treatment with CM 57493 decreased the levels of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid in various brain areas, as observed with other 5-HT1A agonists such as 8-OH-DPAT and ipsapirone. Electrophysiological recording within the dorsal raphe nucleus in chloral hydrate anesthetized rats showed that CM 57493 administration induced a dose-dependent reduction of the spontaneous firing of serotoninergic neurons. In vitro, CM 57493 (5-20 microM) also reduced neuronal firing in the nucleus raphe dorsalis within brainstem slice, and this effect could be prevented by dl-propranolol. Finally, in cats pretreated with reserpine, CM 57493 induced a decrease in ponto-geniculo-occipital activity, which could be antagonized by methiothepin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were purified and maintained in culture. On exposure to bradykinin they released noradrenaline. The characteristics of this stimulus secretion were compared with the response to elevated extracellular potassium. Bradykinin released noradrenaline with an EC50 of about 2 nM, with maximum release (2-3 times control incubations) less than that elicited by high potassium or nicotine. Bradykinin analogs showed the response to have characteristics of a B2 receptor. On continuous exposure to 10 nM bradykinin the rate of release was maximal in the first 1 to 3 min, with a further slower sustained rate of release. The response is mostly, but not completely, dependent on extracellular calcium, and was inhibited by cadmium in the micromolar range. Whereas the potassium-stimulated release was highly sensitive to dihydrophyridines, the bradykinin response was not attenuated by dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists. The results are discussed with respect to stimulus-secretion mechanisms possibly involved in the bradyininin-stimulated release in the light of previous observations characterizing a phosphoinositide response to bradykinin in these cells.\r"

Conscious rats were exposed to hypoxic gas composed of 8% O2-92% N2. After blood gas tensions and blood pH were stabilized, rats received 5 mg/kg i.v. theophylline, and urine and blood samples were collected. The steady-state volume of distribution, unbound free fraction and hematocrit were unaffected by hypoxemia. Total body clearance was significantly changed (P less than .01) from 0.156 +/- 0.020 l/kg/hr in control to 0.0556 +/- 0.0067 l/kg/hr in hypoxemic rats due to the reduction of both hepatic and renal clearances. In another constant rate i.v. infusion study, the plateau plasma concentration of theophylline was elevated steeply as soon as animals had inspired hypoxic gas, and the elevated concentrations went down after returning to room air. The present results suggested that the variation of arterial oxygen tension is one possible mechanism for a rapid and large intraindividual variability in theophylline clearance in acutely ill patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r"

  ".W": "The simultaneous administration of caffeine has been shown to potentiate acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. In the present study, the mechanisms of this effect were studied. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, fasted for 18 hr, were given acetaminophen (0.5 g/kg) and/or caffeine (0.1 g/kg) i.p. Two hours later, the depletion of hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) induced by acetaminophen was more pronounced by the concomitant administration of caffeine, although the effect of caffeine alone on the hepatic GSH content was minimal at this dose. Covalent binding of a reactive metabolite of acetaminophen to hepatic proteins was increased by caffeine although the free acetaminophen content in the liver was not affected. In isolated rat hepatocytes prepared from normal animals, caffeine enhanced acetaminophen-induced GSH depletion and potentiated covalent binding of the reactive metabolite to cellular proteins. The extracellular release of GSH + oxidized glutathione was decreased by acetaminophen, and this decrease was potentiated further by the addition of caffeine. In the cells, the production of acetaminophen-GSH conjugate also was increased in the presence of caffeine, whereas that of glucuronide conjugate was decreased. In microsomes, NADPH-dependent production of acetaminophen-GSH conjugate was increased in the presence of caffeine. Thus, caffeine appears to potentiate acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity mainly by enhancing the production of a reactive metabolite of acetaminophen by mixed function oxidases. To what extend caffeine-induced GSH depletion plays a role is to be clarified.\r"

  ".U": "89199487\r", 
  ".W": "Neurotoxic mechanisms of methylmercury (Met-Hg) on presynaptic nerve terminals were studied using the synaptosomes from the cerebral cortex of guinea pig as a model. Cytosolic free calcium [Ca++)c was determined using intrasynaptically trapped fluorescence indicator, fura-2; the plasma membrane potential (delta Up) by measuring the diffusion potential of 86Rb+ and the mitochondrial membrane potential was monitored using the safranine method. Synaptosomal respiration, glycolysis and concentrations of ATP and ADP in the presence and absence of Met-Hg also were quantified. Met-Hg increased synaptosomal [Ca++]c by two distinctive mechanisms. Moderate elevation of [Ca++]c by 127 nM was observed at 30 microM Met-Hg, at which concentration synaptosomal respiration was inhibited completely, leading to partial depolarization of mitochondria. A 3-fold activation of anaerobic glycolysis upon inhibition of respiration was insufficient to sustain terminal energy levels. The delta Up did not depolarize significantly from the resting potential of--67 mV. Thus, the rise in [Ca++]c was due to the energy failure of the synaptosomes, which has been caused by Met-Hg. With 100 microM Met-Hg, [Ca++]c increased extensively by 882 nM. Upon addition of 100 microM Met-Hg the delta Up depolarized instantly dropping 36 mV within 1 min. Synaptosomes were severely energy-deprived, because anaerobic glycolysis was inhibited by 90% from the aerobic level and mitochondrial membrane potential dropped below the limit that could be detected by the safranine method. The proportion of fura-2 signal quenching by Mn++ also increased, indicating that the plasma membrane had become leaky. Thus, at high concentrations of Met-Hg, the rise in [Ca++]c was ascribed to increased ionic permeability of the plasma membrane. The contribution of presynaptic energy failure by Met-Hg is discussed as a possible biochemical mechanism underlying the neurotoxicity of organic mercury.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on the release of endogenous glutamic acid (GLU) and of [3H]ACh have been investigated comparatively in superfused rat hippocampal synaptosomes. Exogenous ACh added to the superfusion fluid inhibited the Ca++-dependent K+ (15 mM)-evoked release of GLU in a concentration-dependent manner (the maximal inhibition was about 50%). Carbachol and oxotremorine mimicked, although less potently, the action of ACh. The inhibition of GLU release caused by 10 microM ACh was antagonized by 0.1 microM atropine but not by 10 microM mecamylamine. It also was insensitive to the M-1 receptor antagonists pirenzepine or dicyclomine (both at 1 microM). In contrast, the novel M-2 muscarinic antagonist AF-DX 116 [(11-[(2-[diethylamino]methyl)-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5-11-dihydro-6 H-pyrido-[2-3-b][1,4]benzo-diazepine-6-one] was as potent as atropine in blocking the inhibition of GLU release brought about by ACh. The autoreceptor-mediated inhibition of [3H]ACh release observed in presence of ACh (10 microM) was totally antagonized by atropine (0.1 microM). It was insensitive to mecamylamine (10 microM), dicyclomine (1 microM) or pirenzepine (1 microM). However, it was much less sensitive to AF-DX 116 (80-100 times) than the cholinergic inhibition of GLU release. It is concluded that 1) the release of GLU in rat hippocampus can be inhibited through a muscarinic receptor and 2) this novel muscarinic receptor belongs to the M-2 subtype but it seems to differ pharmacologically from the M-2 autoreceptor.\r"

Rats developed a unilateral localized inflammation upon injection of Freund's complete adjuvant into one hindpaw. 4-6 days after inoculation, intraplantar administration of mu, delta and kappa selective agonists [D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Gly-ol5]-en-kephalin (1 micrograms), [D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin (40 micrograms) and U-50, 488H (50 micrograms) produced marked antinociceptive effects in inflamed but not noninflamed paws. Equivalent doses applied systemically (s.c. and i.v.) were without effect. Dose dependency and stereospecificity of these effects were demonstrated using (-)- and (+)-morphine and (-)- and (+)-tifluadom. Furthermore, by use of (-)- and (+)-naloxone, dose-dependent and stereospecific antagonism was shown. Lastly, reversal of effects of [D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Gly-Ol5]-enkephalin, [D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin and U-50,488H by mu, delta and kappa selective antagonists D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2, ICI 174,864 and nor-BNI, respectively, indicated that these agents interact with discriminable populations of receptors. These observations suggest that several selective opioid agonists can modulate responses to noxious pressure through a peripheral opioid receptor-specific site of action in inflammation and that these receptors possess distinguishable pharmacological characteristics resembling those of mu, delta and kappa receptors.\r"

Each substance elicited dose-dependent increases in the three parameters and the ranking of the potency (ED50) for each effect was isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than dobutamine greater than or equal to salbutamol greater than or equal to procaterol. The ED50 of procaterol for changing sinus rate was lower than for altering atrial and ventricular contractile force, whereas the ED50 of dobutamine for changing sinus rate was higher. Ranking on the basis of the ratio of increase in sinus rate to increase in atrial tension induced by the agonists gave the following order: procaterol greater than or equal to salbutamol greater than epinephrine greater than or equal to isoproterenol greater than dobutamine. Procaterol-induced increases in sinus rate and atrial contractile force were dose-dependently inhibited by the beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551, but only attenuated slightly by the beta-1 antagonist, atenolol. On the other hand, the positive chrono- and inotropic effects on the right atrium induced by dobutamine and isoproterenol were blocked completely by atenolol. The epinephrine- or salbutamol-induced positive chrono- and inotropic responses in the right atrium were inhibited moderately by both antagonists, but ICI 118,551 inhibited sinus rate increases more effectively than the atrial tension increases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study describes the pharmacokinetic behavior of zolpidem in plasma and brain of rat after i.v. and p.o. administration of 2.63 mg.kg-1 of [14C]zolpidem (dose expressed as the base). Autoradiography was used to examine the regional distribution of the compound and the metabolic profile of zolpidem in the plasma and brain was also investigated. The pharmacokinetic data were related to electrocorticogram power spectral analysis. After i.v. administration, the disappearance of zolpidem from plasma fitted a biexponential model with a rapid phase of 0.2 to 0.3 hr and a slower phase of 1.3 to 1.5 hr. After p.o. dosing, peak plasma concentrations where already attained at 15 min (first sampling time). Independent of the route of administration, the concentrations of zolpidem in the brain at shorter times were 30 to 50% those of the plasma values. Furthermore, up to 1 hr, zolpidem accounted for 80 to 90% of brain radioactivity. The rate of disappearance from brain paralleled that from plasma. Autoradiographic studies confirmed the rapid absorption and elimination of zolpidem as well as the relatively homogenous distribution throughout the brain. Electrocorticogram analysis in immobilized rats after i.v. administration of zolpidem showed a rapid onset and a short-acting sedative effect compatible with the kinetic profile of the parent compound. Metabolites of zolpidem displayed a poor penetration into the brain and no significant hypnotic activity. At the dose of zolpidem used, no alteration of the sleep pattern was observed.\r"

The aim of this study was to use lithium as a pharmacological tool to further understand the mechanism of this process. We have used solution hybridization-nuclease protection assays to quantitate the specific preprotachykinin (PPT) mRNAs and radioimmunoassays and immunocytochemistry to assess SP-LI levels in the striatum of male Fisher F-344 rats. A regimen of subchronic administration of lithium (4 mEq/kg i.p. for 1, 2, 4 or 6 days) increased SP-LI in a time-dependent fashion. Concurrent administration of a dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol (1 mg/kg s.c. for 4 days) with a 4-day lithium regimen partially blocked the lithium-induced increase in SP-LI as well as neurokinin A-like immunoreactivity. An analysis of the abundance of individual PPT mRNAs indicated that lithium increases beta- and gamma-PPT mRNAs in the striatum; coadministration of haloperidol attenuates the lithium-induced increases. These results indicate that lithium affects the tachykinin biosynthetic process by accelerating transcriptional and/or translational processes in striatonigral neurons and that the dopaminergic system appears to be partly involved in this process.\r"

  ".W": "Taxol is a natural plant product which has antimitotic activity. It is currently being investigated for use both as a cancer chemotherapy agent and as a tool to investigate microtubule involvement with various cellular functions. In the studies reported here, the actions of taxol on cultured adrenal medullary cells are compared to those of two other taxanes, baccatin III and 19-hydroxybaccatin III, which are structurally similar but lacking a bulky ester linkage at the C13 position. Unlike taxol, baccatin III and 19-hydroxybaccatin III have little or no known actions on mammalian microtubules. These studies were designed 1) to establish structural requirements for taxol's effects on adrenal cells and 2) to investigate whether the effects of taxol on adrenal cells involve microtubules. The effects of taxol on basal catecholamine release, on nicotinic receptor-stimulated catecholamine release and on the adrenal microtubule network are quantitatively and qualitatively different from those of baccatin III and 19-hydroxybaccatin III. These results suggest that esterification of taxol at position C13 is important in taxol's inhibitory actions on nicotinic receptor-stimulated catecholamine release. Similar structure requirements have been reported for taxol's actions on microtubules. Catecholamine release stimulated through activation of nicotinic receptors is much more sensitive to the inhibitory actions of taxol than is release stimulated by other secretagogues. Finally, a direct effect of taxol on the adrenal microtubular network was demonstrated using treatment conditions which are similar to those used to interfere with nicotinic receptor function. The studies reported here offer further evidence that taxol's actions on nicotinic receptor function may involve microtubules.\r"

Infusion of menadione (64-1000 microM) into perfused livers from fasted rats caused a concentration-dependent increase in O2 uptake. During perfusion in the anterograde direction, menadione (1 mM) increased O2 uptake from 115 +/- 11 to 142 +/- 10 mumol/g/hr within 30 min, followed by a decrease to 92 +/- 11 mumol/g/hr over the next 30 min. Trypan blue was taken up by 90% of cells in periportal regions reflecting irreversible cell death, whereas cells in pericentral areas were not damaged. When the hepatic O2 gradient was reversed by perfusing in the retrograde direction, menadione increased O2 uptake initially from 114 +/- 11 to 132 +/- 14 mumol/g/hr, followed by a decline to 51 +/- 12 mumol/g/hr, qualitatively similar to data obtained from perfusions in the natural, anterograde direction. During perfusions in the retrograde direction, however, 95% of cells in pericentral regions were stained with trypan blue whereas those in periportal areas were spared. O2 uptake in specific zones of the liver lobule was then measured with miniature O2 electrodes. When menadione was infused during anterograde perfusions, O2 uptake increased in O2-rich periportal areas from 128 +/- 6 to 156 +/- 12 mumol/g/hr, but was not altered in pericentral regions.

Twenty-two dogs developed ventricular fibrillation (susceptible) whereas the remaining 14 animals did not (resistant) during this exercise plus ischemia test. The exercise plus ischemia test was repeated in the susceptible dogs after the following treatments: verapamil (n = 17, 250 micrograms/kg), nifedipine (n = 9, 10 and 100 micrograms/kg) and magnesium sulfate (n = 9, 100 mg/kg). Verapamil prevented ventricular fibrillation in all dogs whereas the high dose of nifedipine protected eight of nine animals; the low dose of nifedipine protected one of nine animals and magnesium sulfate protected seven of nine dogs. Finally, the calcium channel agonist Bay K8644 (n = 9, 30 micrograms/kg) was given to resistant animals. All resistant dogs developed ventricular fibrillation when the exercise plus ischemia test was repeated after Bay K8644. These data suggest that calcium entry may play a critical role in the development of arrhythmias during ischemia, with increased calcium entry provoking arrhythmias and calcium entry blockade preventing the lethal events.\r"

The acute administration of phencyclidine produced hypothermia. This hypothermia occurred only after high doses of drug. In contrast, only hyperthermia was found in chronically treated subjects. The hyperthermia in chronically treated subjects was produced by low doses of drug, and sensitization to the hyperthermic effects took place over time. There was no evidence for the involvement of opiate receptors in the acute hypothermic response to phencyclidine, as the hypothermia was not antagonized by naloxone or decreased in chronically morphine-treated subjects. Moreover, the hypothermic response was enhanced by treatment with opiate receptor-active and -inactive enantiomers of naloxone, as well as in chronically morphine-treated subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Pemedolac [cis-1-ethyl-1,3,4,9-tetrahydro-4-(phenylmethyl)-pyrano [3,4-b]indole-1-acetic acid; AY-30,715] exhibited potent analgesic effects against chemically induced pain in rats and mice and against inflammatory pain in rats. In each of the animal models used the analgesic potency of pemedolac was defined by an ED50 of 2.0 mg/kg p.o. or less. Significant analgesic activity was detected in rats at 16 hr after administration of 1 mg/kg p.o. (paw pressure test) and at 10 hr after administration of 10 mg/kg p.o. to mice (p-phenylbenzoquinone writhing). Inasmuch as pemedolac was inactive in the hot plate and tail-flick tests; and its analgesic activity was not antagonized by naloxone (1 mg/kg s.c.), and tolerance did not develop upon multiple administration; this drug does not exert its analgesic effects through an opiate mechanism. Pemedolac differed from standard nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in that the doses which produced analgesia were much lower than those required for either anti-inflammatory or gastric irritant effects. In acute anti-inflammatory tests, pemedolac exhibited only weak activity as evidenced by an ED50 approximately 100 mg/kg p.o. in the carrageenan paw edema procedure. This demonstrates for pemedolac a separation of at least 50-fold between the acute analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities, which was greater than that observed with reference NSAIDs. The compound also had a low ulcerogenic liability with an acute UD50 = 107 mg/kg p.o. and a subacute UD50 estimated to be 140 mg/kg/day p.o. In contrast, the reference NSAIDS (piroxicam, indomethacin, naproxen and ibuprofen) exhibited similar dose-response relationships for the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and gastric irritant effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ethanol-induced increase in the urinary excretion of folate has been determined to be both a time- and dose-dependent phenomenon and it has been speculated that this loss may enhance the development of folate deficiency. However, ethanol has only a minor effect on the renal clearance of exogenously administered [3H]folic acid [3H]PteGlu) in relation to that of inulin. To clarify this variable effect of ethanol, male Sprague-Dawley rats were given four consecutive hourly doses of ethanol at 1 g/kg and placed in metabolic chambers for collection of urine. At 5 hr, [3H]PteGlu was administered and urine samples were collected for 1 hr. At 6 hr, rats were sacrificed with collection of plasma, liver and kidney samples. A significant increase in the urinary excretion of endogenous folates occurred in ethanol-treated rats at both the 4-5- and 5- to 6-hr time periods, but no significant increase in 3H-labeled derivatives was noted in ethanol-treated rats. Subsequent high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of urine extracts showed that the predominant 3H-labeled PteGlu metabolites were [3H]-5-formimino-H4PteGlu and the formyl-tetrahydrofolates, whereas the major endogenous form was 5-CH3-H4PteGlu. Ethanol administration increased significantly the excretion of the methyl derivative, with minor effects on the other folate forms. These results suggest that there is a selective effect of ethanol on the urinary excretion of specific folate derivatives. Also, inasmuch as no 5-formimino-H4-PteGlu was detected in the plasma, the rodent kidney appears to have the capacity for uptake and metabolism of filtered PteGlu.\r"

The effect of ranitidine on the disposition of procainamide and NAPA was evaluated in 13 healthy men. Subjects were randomized to receive p.o. procainamide (1000 mg) alone (base line) and after p.o. ranitidine, 150 mg twice a day for 4 days. Blood and urine samples were collected at frequent intervals for 24 hr after the procainamide dose. There were no significant differences in the mean pharmacokinetic parameters of procainamide and NAPA after ranitidine coadministration compared to base line. However, individual changes did occur and regression analysis revealed a correlation between base-line procainamide renal clearance (CLR) and the change (delta) in CLR after ranitidine (r = 0.69, P less than .01). Subsequently, individuals were separated into Group I (n = 7) if they had a decrease or Group II (n = 6) if they had an increase in procainamide CLR after ranitidine. Mean +/- S.D. base-line procainamide CLR was 539 +/- 114 ml/min for Group I vs. 410 +/- 61 ml/min for Group II (P less than .01).

The purpose was to assess nalbuphine's agonist properties vs. antagonist properties relative to a standard agonist (hydromorphone) and a standard antagonist (naloxone) in opioid-dependent subjects. Drug conditions included saline placebo, nalbuphine hydrochloride (0.375, 0.75, 1.5, 3 and 6 mg), naloxone hydrochloride (0.1 and 0.2 mg) and hydromorphone hydrochloride (4 and 8 mg). Drug conditions, given by i.m. injection, were tested in five subjects under double-blind conditions in 2.5 hr experimental sessions. Physiologic measures were monitored continuously before and for 2 hr after drug administration: pupil diameter and subject- and observer-rated behavioral responses were measured intermittently over this same period. Hydromorphone increased ratings significantly on subjective measures typical of morphine-like effects. Naloxone precipitated opioid abstinence which was measurable on several subject- and observer-rated behavioral measures and physiological measures. Nalbuphine produced effects which were qualitatively similar to the effects of naloxone and showed no evidence of opioid agonist effects in these methadone-dependent subjects. The withdrawal syndrome precipitated by nalbuphine was indistinguishable from that produced by naloxone.\r"

Rings (2-3 mm wide) cut from the main extrapulmonary PA branches were studied. Hypoxic contractions of up to 80 mg (mean +/- S.E. 34 +/- 5 mg, n = 20) were seen in resting rings. The contraction was more reproducible and was potentiated in rings prestimulated with either phenylephrine, norepinephrine, KCl, angiotensin II or the thromboxane mimetic U46619. The magnitude of the hypoxic contraction was proportional to the level of prestimulation and the severity of the hypoxia, with maximum hypoxic contraction seen during exposure to 0% oxygen. The hypoxic dose response showed a threshold bath pO2 of between 30 and 60 Torr, was potentiated by BAY K8644 (10(-7) M), was inhibited by both nifedipine (10(-7) M) and cooling to 29 degrees C and was not inhibited by meclofenamate (1.6 x 10(-6) M). All these characteristics are comparable to previously described features of HPV in the isolated perfused rat lung. Removal of the endothelium resulted in a 48-80% reduction in maximum PA hypoxic contraction. Similar hypoxic contraction was seen in precontracted aortic rings. We conclude that the hypoxic contraction of isolated rat PA may be a useful in vitro model of HPV, that both the endothelium and smooth muscle may be involved in the sensing of PO2 and that the direct hypoxic response is not unique to pulmonary arteries.\r"

The steroids enhanced [3H]muscimol binding to GABA receptor sites, enhanced [3H] flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors and inhibited [35S]t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate binding to picrotoxin/convulsant binding sites on the GABA receptor-chloride channel complex. The same steroids that were active in modulating the binding of ligands to the various receptor sites on the GABA receptor complex at micromolar concentrations enhanced muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- flux in rat hippocampal slices. The steroids, like the barbiturates, increased the maximal response to muscimol but produced little or no potentiation of basal 36Cl- flux in the absence of GABA agonist. Although the effects of steroids and barbiturates were similar, separate sites of action were demonstrated conclusively by the observation that the two classes of compounds, when included together, gave additive or synergistic effects on binding, as well as on 36Cl- flux in the absence of GABA agonist. Structure-activity studies showed that the synthetic steroid anesthetic alphaxalone was the most potent compound tested, followed by the naturally occurring steroids tetrahydro-deoxycorticosterone, allo-tetrahydrocorticosterone, cis-androsterone and 5 alpha-androstan-17 beta-ol-3-one. The ability of several naturally occurring steroids to enhance GABA-mediated inhibition in the brain suggests the possibility of an endogenous steroid modulator of neuronal function.\r"

Subjects initially were exposed to a kindling procedure in which repeated electrical stimulation of the amygdala evoked generalized seizures. After kindling, they were trained under a multiple fixed-ratio 30 interresponse-time-greater than 10-sec schedule of food delivery. Once each day, 6 days per week, 30-min exposures to this schedule were followed immediately by amygdaloid stimulation which occurred at no other time. Response rate, reinforcement rate and duration of forelimb clonus were recorded. When response rates were stable, 5 rats were tested with phenytoin (25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/kg) and 5 others were tested with phenobarbital (10, 25 and 40 mg/kg). Results indicated that doses of phenytoin that controlled kindled seizures also affected operant behavior. For this drug, the ED50 for forelimb clonus was 62 mg/kg. For response rate under the fixed-ratio and interresponse-time components, it was 48 and 58.2 mg/kg, respectively. Dose-response curves for the behavioral and antiseizure effects of phenobarbital were similar. However, for this drug the ED50 for forelimb clonus (18.9 mg/kg) was significantly lower than for response rate under the fixed ratio component (37.4 mg/kg).\r"

  ".W": "Genetic instability has been hypothesized by P. C. Nowell and other investigators to be an important aspect of tumor progression that leads to the generation of metastatic variants. In this study we examined the rate of generation of metastatic variants in mutant cell lines having increased rates of spontaneous mutation and gene amplification. Parallel clonal populations of the spontaneous mutation rate mutant thy-49 and the gene amplification mutants YMP1 and YMP7 and their respective wild types were generated and grown to a critical population size. The number of metastatic variants in each clonal population was then determined following iv injection into nude mice. Lung tumors were scored 3-4 weeks after injection of cells, and the mean number per clonal population was determined. Analysis of the means with the Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test showed no significant differences in the rate of generation of metastatic variants produced in the genetically unstable lines compared to their normal counterparts. This study suggests that increased spontaneous mutation and gene amplification rates in mammalian cells are not sufficient on their own to increase the rate of generation of metastatic variants.\r"

Levels of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen and markers for hepatitis B virus infection in vaccinees were monitored yearly for 5 years. After 5 years of follow-up, 19% of those who initially had an immune response to vaccine of 10 sample ratio units or greater subsequently had levels of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen lower than 10 sample ratio units. During the 5 years after the first dose of vaccine, in three responders and one person with an antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen response lower than 10 sample ratio units, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen developed, and the level of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen was boosted. Hepatitis B surface antigen did not develop in any subjects, and none had clinical hepatitis. In the 5 years following the demonstration project, the annual incidence of hepatitis B virus infection decreased from 50 cases per 1000 population before the vaccine trial to 0.45 per 1000.\r"

The demands of medical training, the rigors of establishing a practice, and the expectations of colleagues are often used as excuses to avoid emotional intimacy in the marital relationship. Attention to the needs of the marriage is regularly postponed until some indefinite point in the future, resulting in considerable covert marital discord. The psychology of postponement ultimately proves to be a psychology of avoidance, growing directly out of the compulsive personality traits of most physicians and their preference for work over family life. Preventive measures are suggested to address the physician's tendency to avoid issues of marital intimacy.\r"

Serious deficiencies were detected in 12% of audits prior to October 1985, but in only 7% since that date. At the same time, there was no evidence of a decline over time in the rate of detection of many categories of deficiencies, and some investigators were able to continue to participate in drug trials after flagrant violations of recognized norms of research. The data auditing program should be continued, but additional measures are needed to regulate misconduct. These must be tailored to the variety of causes of misconduct, ranging from negligence to fraud. Possible additional approaches could include certifying the competence of potential investigators; peer-reviewed, competitive application for the opportunity to conduct FDA-authorized clinical trials; limiting an investigator's level of participation in clinical trials; penalizing manufacturers who fail to detect their investigators' misconduct; and permitting the FDA to suspend investigators prior to a hearing. Measures taken should maximize public utility at the least economic cost to society and should be evaluated thoroughly.\r"

Measles in 4 such children resulted in 3 severe pneumonias and 1 death despite previous immunization in 2. Antibody to measles as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was present in 3 (12.5%) of 24 children studied retrospectively and developed in only 2 (25%) of 8 children immunized and followed up prospectively. The sera of 9 of 24 children had antibody when tested by sensitive hemagglutination inhibition. Measles developed in 2 of 6 children who had negative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results and positive hemagglutination inhibition results. No adverse consequences of measles immunization were detected. Although the immunogenicity of measles vaccine in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus was low and vaccine failure occurred, the apparent safety provides the rationale for immunization in the face of a potentially fatal disease. Since neither documented immunization nor low-level antibody guaranteed immunity to measles, we recommend passive postexposure immunoglobulin prophylaxis for all children infected with human immunodeficiency virus.\r"

To evaluate the effect of a potential recall bias, an \"alternate-condition\" control group was enrolled. A medical record review study was conducted to assess the potential for diagnostic bias, and a blanket surveillance of all hospitals in a region was conducted to evaluate reporting bias. Twenty-four case subjects and 48 matched controls were enrolled. Eight-eight percent of case subjects and only 17% of controls had received aspirin prior to the onset of Reye's syndrome (matched odds ratio, 35; 95% confidence interval, 4.2 to 288). Further analyses demonstrated that the association could not be attributed to the five potential sources of bias.\r"

In the second protocol, patients were treated with 10-mg systems for four weeks followed by 15-mg systems for eight weeks. Serum samples were obtained three to five hours after application of the transdermal therapeutic system. Testosterone increased from a pretreatment level (mean +/- SE) of 1.5 +/- 0.4 nmol/L to 15.2 +/- 3.4 nmol/L at four weeks, 18.6 +/- 3.3 nmol/L at eight weeks, and 17.3 +/- 2.8 nmol/L at 12 weeks. The serum testosterone/dihydrotestosterone (DHT) ratio fell from 4.53 to 2.47 at four weeks and was similar at eight and 12 weeks, reflecting a greater rise in DHT with this route of treatment (normal testosterone/DHT ratio, 9/1 to 12/1). Eight patients were treated with the 15-mg systems for an additional year. Seven of the eight were compliant and maintained serum testosterone levels (at six time points from two to 12 months [mean +/- SE] ) ranging from 11.5 +/- 1.2 to 44.9 +/- 2.4 nmol/L. It was possible to achieve physiological serum levels of testosterone by transdermal administration of testosterone in two thirds of our hypogonadal men.\r"

Data were gathered for 1 year before and after the institution of a program designed to reduce violence, primarily in ambulatory care areas, among this group. Outcome assessment included comparison of the number of violent incidents and the number of visits to the medical center during the 12 months before and after the program was started. The number of incidents declined by 91.6%, and visits to the medical center for any reason decreased by 42.2%. The ratio of violent incidents to visits after the program was begun was less than one sixth the rate before the program.

  ".W": "When coronary balloon angioplasty is performed on lesions that involve a major bifurcation in the coronary arterial tree, side-branch occlusion often results. Previously described strategies for avoiding this problem have been cumbersome and relatively impractical for routine application. In this report, we describe a simple method of dilating bifurcation lesions, made possible by recent innovations in angioplasty equipment. Two individual Probe dilation catheters are passed through a triple-armed Duostat adapter into a single guiding catheter. The bifurcation lesions are then sequentially traversed with the Probe catheters, after which the balloons can be inflated simultaneously or serially. Our early experience with this technique suggests that it is a safe, simple, and effective method to dilate bifurcation stenoses.\r"

Acute lung injury occurred in 11 patients, 1 of whom died; early diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes and hemorrhagic pulmonary edema and acute edema of the airways were found at autopsy. In one patient, hypoxemia and transient obstruction of the airways developed, but no pulmonary infiltrates were noted. One patient had symptoms for 5 weeks and diffuse confluent pulmonary infiltrates; many years later, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease developed (he had, however, been a heavy smoker before exposure). Bronchiolitis obliterans was not observed in the other patients, probably because of less severe exposure or early corticosteroid therapy. Prophylactic corticosteroid therapy is advised for workers who have been exposed to silo gas. The management of patients with established acute lung injury is reviewed. Previously unreported patterns of exposure to silo gas in conventional silos are described, and recommendations for avoiding exposure are suggested.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of five brains from patients with a clinical and pathologic diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis. Areas of prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation could easily be identified within the white matter subjacent to the cortical tubers despite formalin fixation and storage. The signal changes were identical to those reported in living patients with the disease. The detection of cortical tubers by MRI in two patients who were 34 and 35 years of age, respectively, at the time of death suggests that the signal changes on MRI are less affected by aging than are the low-attenuation changes on computed tomography, which are rarely identified in patients older than 27 years of age. Once the changes caused by fixation of tissues are considered, postmortem MRI is a viable investigative tool in studying tuberous sclerosis and other diseases, and it seems to correlate well with the MRI findings in living patients, as well as the gross and histopathologic changes seen at autopsy.\r"

To determine the characteristic diastolic filling abnormalities in this disorder, we recorded left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time and transvalvular and hepatic venous flow velocities by pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography in 28 patients with pericardial effusion (16 with and 12 without cardiac tamponade) and 20 normal control subjects. The phase of respiration was recorded simultaneously with all profiles. In 13 of the 16 patients with cardiac tamponade, Doppler examination was repeated after pericardiocentesis. In patients with cardiac tamponade, respiratory variations in transvalvular flow velocities and isovolumic relaxation time were substantially increased in comparison with values in normal subjects, patients without tamponade, and those who had undergone pericardiocentesis. An exaggerated expiratory decrease in diastolic forward flow and increase in reverse flow in the hepatic vein also were characteristic of patients with cardiac tamponade. Thus, Doppler echocardiography is an additional noninvasive means of detecting hemodynamic compromise in patients with pericardial effusion.\r"

Complete follow-up was achieved in 223 of 227 (98%) consecutively diagnosed, eligible patients of all ages. After 5 years, the cumulative progression-free survival (with 95% confidence interval) was 71.8 (65.5-78.1)% and survival corrected for causes of death other than prostatic cancer was 93.8 (88.3-97.6)%. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed no association between age at diagnosis and the natural course. Local progression was less common in localised, non-palpable tumours than in larger tumours. The rate of progression was 18.7 (6.1-57.1) times higher and that of disease-specific death 216.0 (31.2-1496) times higher in patients with poorly than in those with highly differentiated tumours. It is concluded that tumour grade at diagnosis is an excellent predictor of local and distant progression. The low death rate, especially in patients with highly and moderately differentiated tumours, means that any local or systemic therapy intended for patients with early prostatic cancer must be evaluated in clinical trials with untreated controls for comparison.\r"

A mean (SEM) pressure gradient across the dilated lesion of only 3(1) mm Hg and an average minimum lesion diameter of 1.7 mm indicated that the decline in resting blood flow was not due to obstruction at the site of the original lesion. Neither distal vascular emboli nor side branch occlusions were visible on the angiogram. An increase in distal coronary artery pressure during a subsequent balloon inflation suggested that the site of vasoconstriction was distal to the origin of collateral vessels. The syndrome lasted 48-80 min and was not reversed with nitroglycerin or thrombolytic drugs. Papaverine lessened the syndrome transiently on one occasion. Such microvascular constriction, caused by release of potent vasoconstrictors from the clot, may partly explain the failure of emergency angioplasty to reduce infarct size in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

None was HIV-1 seropositive but 4.7% were seropositive for HIV-2 (0.6% in children, 8.9% in those aged 15 years and over, and 20% in those aged 40 years and over). There was no significant difference in seroprevalence between areas or ethnic groups or between individuals of different civil status when age was taken into account. Sexual contact and blood transfusions were the dominant transmission routes, and no case of vertical transmission was identified. The HIV-2 seroprevalence in spouses of HIV-2 seropositive index persons was 40%. For a history of blood transfusion the relative risk of being HIV-2 seropositive was 103.6 in children and 2.4 for adults. After exclusion of spouses, no clustering of HIV-2 seropositivity was seen. At follow-up, after a mean observation time of 325 days, there was an excess mortality for HIV-2 seropositives. The relative risk of dying for HIV-2 seropositive children was 60.8 and for adults 5.0.\r"

Serum total cholesterol at entry ranged from 4.0 to 8.8 mmol/l (mean 6.3, SD 1.1). Cox's proportional hazards analysis showed a J-shaped relation between serum cholesterol and mortality. Mortality was lowest at serum cholesterol 7.0 mmol/l, 5.2 times higher than the minimum at serum cholesterol 4.0 mmol/l, and only 1.8 times higher when cholesterol concentration was 8.8 mmol/l. This relation held true irrespective of age, even when blood pressure, body weight, history of myocardial infarction, creatinine clearance, and plasma proteins were taken into account. The relation between low cholesterol values and increased mortality was independent of the incidence of cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was assessed by use of WHO diagnostic criteria in 6299 Africans aged 15 years and above living in six villages in Tanzania. 0.87% (1.1% male, 0.68% female) had diabetes and 7.8% (6.9% male, 7.7% female) had IGT. Prevalence rates were 1.1% and 8.4%, respectively, when age-adjusted to the USA population. Only 7 (13.5%) of the 53 individuals with diabetes had been known to have the disorder; 34 (74%) of the other 46 were symptom-free. Mean age was 54 (SD 20) for diabetic subjects and 37 (17) years for the whole population. Diabetes and IGT rates did not differ significantly between villages despite geographical, socioeconomic, and dietary differences. Diabetes rates increased modestly with age and body mass index (BMI). Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels did not rise significantly with age but correlated positively with systolic blood pressure (BP) and negatively with haemoglobin concentration (Hb) and BMI. The 2 hour post-glucose load blood glucose values correlated positively with age, sex, and systolic BP and negatively with Hb. Diabetes is less prevalent in rural Africa than in developed countries, even when age has been corrected for. This difference is probably related to body weight, diet, and exercise.\r"

The sensitivity of mammography was 88%. Only 18 cancers were detected by mammography alone, and of these 3 were in the other breast. 7 of the remaining 15 cancers had clinical signs which would have been pursued to open biopsy in the absence of mammography. Clinical examination is of paramount importance in the management of patients with symptomatic breast disease. Mammography is most useful when applied in specific situations rather than to screen every patient with breast symptoms.\r"

It occurs especially in pre-adolescent children. In developed countries, where endemicity of hepatitis B virus is low, horizontal transmission (probably via saliva or open wounds) may occur in households with a persistent carrier, but it is less efficient a means of infection than is sexual or perinatal transmission. Horizontal transmission also seems possible in pre-school day-care centres in developed countries, despite the small numbers of carriers in such places.\r"

  ".W": "The development of the body plan in the Drosophila embryo depends on the activity of maternal determinants localized at the anterior and posterior of the egg. These activities define both the polarity of the anterior-posterior (AP) axis and the spatial domains of expression of the zygotic gap genes, which in turn control the subsequent steps in segmentation. The nature and mode of action of one anterior determinant, the bicoid(bcd) gene product, has recently been defined, but the posterior determinants are less well characterized. At least seven maternally acting genes are required for posterior development. Mutations in these maternal posterior-group genes result in embryos lacking all abdominal segments. Cytoplasmic transplantation studies indicate that the maternally encoded product of the nanos(nos) gene may act as an abdominal determinant, whereas the other maternal posterior-group genes appear to be required for the appropriate localization and stabilization of this signal. Here we show that the lack of the nos gene product can be compensated for by eliminating the maternal activity of the gap gene hunchback (hb). Embryos lacking both of these maternally derived gene products are viable and can survive as fertile adults. These results suggest that the nos gene product functions by repressing the activity of the maternal hb products in the posterior of the egg.\r"

The Mu transposase (A protein) of relative molecular mass 75,000 is a central component of the transposition machinery. We report here that the N-terminal region of Mu transposase contains two distinct DNA-binding domains, one which binds the two Mu DNA ends, and another which binds an internal operator region. This internal operator is required for the transposase-mediated synapsis and nicking of Mu ends in vitro, and stimulates transposition more than 100-fold in vivo. The orientation of the operator with respect to the ends is critical to its function, whereas its distance from the ends seems to be relatively unimportant. We propose that the operator enhances transposition by transiently interacting with the transposase and Mu DNA end(s) to form a complex in which synapsis of the ends occurs.\r"

  ".W": "Simian virus 40 (SV40) replicates in nuclei of human and monkey cells. One viral protein, large tumour (T) antigen, is required for the initiation of DNA replication. The development of in vitro replication systems which retain this property has facilitated the identification of the cellular components required for replication. T antigen recognizes the pentanucleotide 5'-GAGGC-3' which is present in four copies within the 64 base-pairs (bp) of the core origin. In the presence of ATP it binds with increased affinity forming a distinctive, bilobed structure visible in electron micrographs. As a helicase, it unwinds SV40 DNA bidirectionally from the origin. We report here that in vitro and in the presence of ATP, T antigen assembles a double hexamer, centred on the core origin and extending beyond it by 12 bp in each direction. The assembly of this dodecamer initiates an untwisting of the duplex by 2-3 turns. In the absence of ATP, a tetrameric structure is the largest found at the core origin. In the absence of DNA, but in the presence of ATP or its non-hydrolysable analogues, T antigen assembles into hexamers. This suggests that ATP effects an allosteric change in the monomer. The change alters protein-protein interactions and allows the assembly of a double hexamer, which initiates replication at the core origin.\r"

Nevertheless, breech-breech pairs attained similar or larger birth weights when compared with other combinations. Discordant-second twins were found five times more frequently in breech-second pairs when twin A was in the vertex presentation. It is possible that breech-breech pairs reach a critical utero-fetal proportion earlier, resulting in earlier labor. Alternatively, twins may arrange in second-breech presentations as an adaptive measure to promote growth. We recommend special care for persistent breech-breech presentations diagnosed at the beginning of the third trimester.\r"

Patients with documented lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratios of less than 2.0 and a singleton gestation were eligible to participate in the study. One hundred sixty-five patients qualified and were randomized, using sealed envelopes, to four study groups. All patients were followed expectantly. Group I (41 patients) received neither ampicillin nor corticosteroids. Group II (43 patients) received 24 mg of antenatal betamethasone. Group III (37 patients) received 2 g of intravenous ampicillin every 6 hours, with discontinuation of antibiotic therapy if cultures were negative for pathogenic bacteria. Group IV (44 patients) received both corticosteroids and ampicillin as described for groups II and III, respectively. Compared with patients not receiving corticosteroids, those administered antenatal corticosteroids experienced a reduction in the incidences of respiratory distress syndrome (53 versus 26%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (23 versus 9%), severe grades of intracranial hemorrhage (15 versus 3%), and patent ductus arteriosus (18 versus 6%), with no difference in the incidence of maternal or neonatal infection. Compared with patients not receiving antenatal antibiotics, the group of patients treated with ampicillin on admission had a lower incidence of clinical chorioamnionitis (4 versus 26%) and neonatal sepsis (5 versus 10%). This reduction in infectious morbidity by antenatal ampicillin was restricted to those patients (28.4% of the study population) colonized with group B streptococci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study addresses the possibility that imprecision of reflectance meters may affect the reliability of the blood sugar values obtained with their use. We tested four reflectance meters (Glucometer, Glucometer II, Glucoscan 3000, and Accuchek II) on 84 gravidas undergoing 1-hour, 50-g glucose screening, and calculated average coefficients of variation (9.6 +/- 10.9, 8.2 +/- 4.7, 6.8 +/- 4.5, and 7.4 +/- 4.4%, respectively). One-way analysis of variance testing indicated no significant difference between these values (P = .11). However, comparison with the coefficients of variation from standard laboratory technology (YSI Model 23A Glucose Analyzer) applied to simultaneously obtained venous samples (2.3 +/- 1.5, 1.5 +/- 0.6, 1.9 +/- 1.0, and 1.0 +/- 0.5%) revealed that the meters all had coefficients of variation significantly higher (P less than .0001). Use of reflectance meters would have resulted in 45.2% (38 of 84) of the subjects undergoing 3-hour oral glucose tolerance tests. Use of standard laboratory values would have indicated these tests in only 16% (14 of 84). The inconvenience and increased cost of these oral glucose tolerance tests suggest that meters may not be appropriate for screening.\r"

Among these are parity, infant birth weight, and various procedures performed by the birth attendant, including episiotomy. Whether episiotomies protect against or provoke laceration of the rectal sphincter and rectal mucosa is particularly controversial. Logistic analysis was used in an observational study of 2706 spontaneous cephalic deliveries to determine the risk of rectal injury for each of six explanatory factors, simultaneously controlling for the other factors. The adjusted risk for rectal injury was significantly increased for midline episiotomy (8.9 versus no episiotomy), nulliparity (3.3 versus parous), delivery by a physician (2.4 versus midwife), fetal macrosomia (2.4 versus normal weight), and delivery in a delivery room (2.0 versus labor bed). Compared with the risk for whites, significantly increased risk was found for Hispanic (1.9), Filipino (3.7), and Chinese (2.9) women. The practice of prophylactic midline episiotomy is questioned, and suggestions are offered for the design of experimental studies to resolve the questions raised.\r"

This difference is highly significant (chi 2 = 10.7; P less than .005) but is biased because infants in the steroid group had a better prognosis. After adjustment for discrepancies in birth weight and gestational age and other confounding obstetric variables, survival in the steroid group remained substantially higher (relative odds of survival 1.85, 95% confidence intervals 1.16-2.86; P = .006). The improvements in survival were not at the expense of increased rates of chronic ill health or impairments of growth neurodevelopment up to at least 5 years of age. For extremely immature and extremely low birth weight infants, steroids are rarely contraindicated on fetal grounds.\r"

The evaluation consisted of paired repeat Papanicolaou smears and colposcopy. Colposcopically directed biopsies and/or endocervical curettage were performed in 86% of the subjects. The results of the paired Papanicolaou smears were negative/negative in 202 patients (56%). Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was diagnosed histopathologically in 16% of all patients and in 10% of those with negative/negative repeat smears. We conclude that the presence of atypical squamous cells in a Papanicolaou smear should be considered abnormal and that colposcopy and colposcopically directed biopsies should be performed for these patients.\r"

Blood samples were obtained before treatment and then after 1, 4, and 12 months of treatment. Serum was analyzed for cholesterol and triglycerides in serum and for cholesterol in the ultracentrifugally separated lipoprotein fractions of very low-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, and high-density lipoproteins. Significant reductions of serum cholesterol were found in all treatment groups except for that given 2.5 mg megestrol acetate. After 1 and 4 months of treatment, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 7-22%, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was reduced by 2-16% in the four groups. No significant differences could be demonstrated among the groups in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol during treatment, as assessed by analysis of variance. Thus, cholesterol metabolism was equally influenced by both progestin types. Accordingly, the clinical efficacy and acceptance would decide the preparation to be advocated for women in need of hormone replacement therapy.\r"

Plasma estrone levels were physiologic after the lower dose of conjugated equine estrogen and supraphysiologic after ingestion of the higher dose. All four treatment regimens successfully controlled hot flushes, but patients who received 1.25 mg conjugated equine estrogen with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate had a higher energy level and a more enhanced sense of well-being (P less than .05). The four treatments all had favorable effects on lipid metabolism, albeit in a dose-related manner: After 1 year of treatment, high-density lipoprotein levels increased 4.3, 13.7, 13.4, and 19% in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively, compared with pre-treatment values. The high-density lipoprotein/low-density lipoprotein ratios, an antiatherogenic index, increased by 7.3, 13.6, 24, and 43% in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. The findings of this study on the relative effects of different doses of oral estrogen and progestin, administered sequentially, on clinical symptoms and lipid metabolism provide guidelines for the treatment of postmenopausal women.\r"

Significant levels of progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor were seen localized in stromal and myometrial elements that diverged from the malignant epithelial component. Analyses of endometrial adenocarcinomas with anti-progesterone receptor and anti-estrogen receptor antibodies correlated with histologic differentiation. The ability to define divergent receptor populations in stromal and myometrial elements versus malignant epithelial elements indicates that immunohistochemical assay of progesterone and estrogen receptor provides information complementary to that from conventional quantitative ligand binding assays.\r"

We term this clinical phenomenon the \"normal-sized ovary carcinoma syndrome.\" In an effort to study this dilemma, the clinical records and pathology slides were reviewed for 11 cases identified from 1976-1987. Four diagnostic groups were identified: mesothelioma (four patients), \"extragonadal mullerian\" tumors (two patients), metastatic tumors of unknown origin (four patients), and ovarian carcinoma (one patient). The survival for each of the first three groups is usually less than 1 year. Improved survival for mesotheliomas may be achieved with a combination of radiotherapy, an adriamycin-based chemotherapy regimen, and debulking surgery. A successful treatment strategy for serous surface papillary carcinoma has not been identified. Patients with metastatic tumors of unknown origin should either be treated with 5-fluorouracil or should not be treated at all. In order to discern the site of origin, satisfactory perioperative radiologic assessment, fastidious surgical exploration, and adequate communication between the surgeon and the pathologist are necessary.\r"

Eighteen of the 19 patients had measurable disease at the time of relapse. Nine patients had a clinical complete response to the cisplatin-based re-treatment, and nine patients had a partial response (surgically documented in one case). The overall response rate to secondary cisplatin-based chemotherapy was therefore 100% in patients with measurable disease. Toxicity of re-treatment was acceptable. The median progression-free survival, as measured from the diagnosis of relapse to the time of disease progression, was 10.6 months (range 4-24 months). The median survival from diagnosis of relapse was 19.3 months (range 5-39 months). At the time of analysis, three patients were alive without evidence of disease, four were alive with tumor, and 12 were dead of cancer. These data suggest that re-induction with cisplatin-based chemotherapy should be considered for patients who develop recurrent disease after favorable responses to primary cisplatin-based chemotherapy.\r"

The application of this type of technology to the generation of \"narrative\" discharge summaries represents an extension of these applications and an incentive for house officer compliance. A system of data gathering and reporting, combined with the generation of discharge summaries, letters to referring physicians, and billing work sheets, has been in use in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The Medical College of Georgia for 2 years. A group of 103 patients discharged during the month of October 1985 served as controls for a comparable prospective group of 104 patients discharged beginning October 1, 1987. Analysis shows an average (+/- SEM) of 3.8 +/- 0.6 days from discharge to printed discharge summary from the computer system. Before implementation of the system (1985), the average was 20.9 +/- 4.5 days. This difference was statistically significant at P = .001. Although it may be difficult to quantitate improvement in quality of the data obtained for residency and departmental purposes, this reduction in delinquent charts alone may be sufficient to recommend the application of computer technology to this problem.\r"

Cure rates were similar for both groups: ticarcillin/clavulanic acid 85% and clindamycin-gentamicin 81%.

The records were classified as \"usable\" if the baseline was above zero and the peak of the recorded contraction was at least 15 mmHg above the baseline. Both systems were studied under similar clinical conditions. Overall, of the 7434 minutes of recordings in 49 patients using the beltless system, 7008 minutes (94%) were usable. In contrast, only 2515 out of 5667 minutes (45%) of recordings made with the belted system were usable (P less than .001). Seven additional patients were monitored simultaneously with the beltless tocodynamometer and the intrauterine pressure catheter systems. Of the 1367 minutes' total monitoring time, the recovery rates of usable data for the beltless and intrauterine pressure catheter systems were 85 and 87%, respectively (P = not significant). These preliminary results indicate that the beltless system is a convenient, simple-to-use external tocodynamometric system that assesses uterine activity more efficiently than the belted system.\r"

This woman was premenopausal and sexually inactive, and had no other risk factors for failure of the vaginal apical scar. At the time of surgical repair, it appeared that the vaginal incision had failed because the apex was placed on tension between the anterior vaginal wall's attachment to the iliopectineal line and the opposing posterior traction of the uterosacral plication on the posterior vagina. This phenomenon seemed to be a consequence of the original alteration of the vaginal axis by the urethral suspension combined with subsequent enterocele prophylaxis.\r"

  ".W": "The clinicopathologic features and the results of diagnostic studies were reviewed in five patients with primary orbital liposarcoma. The major clinical complaints were diplopia and proptosis; visual function was typically well maintained. In three cases, computed tomographic (CT) scans displayed lesions with a central fat density rimmed by a variably radiodense pseudocapsule, leading to the erroneous clinical impression that the lesions were cystic in character. Ultrasonography ruled out a truly cystic tumor by demonstrating internal acoustic interfaces. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in one case showed hyperintense signals in T-1-weighted images, suggesting the presence of fat within the lesional tissue. In the other two cases, CT scans showed reticulated densities accentuating the septa of the orbital fat in the absence of clear-cut circumscription. A potentially useful feature pointing to a neoplasm was bowing of an involved extraocular muscle, which is usually straightened and splinted in either Graves' disease or inflammatory pseudotumor. Histopathologically, two lesions were well-differentiated liposarcomas and three were myxoid liposarcomas, all featuring univacuolar signet ring lipoblasts. Scattered bizarre hyperchromatic mesenchymal cells without prominent lipidization were present in the lesions. None of the patients has experienced regional or distant metastases with follow-ups from onset of 1 to 7 years (mean, 5.2 years); three required orbital exenteration after local recurrence; and two who refused exenteration received only orbital radiotherapy.\r"

When a mastoidectomy is indicated, the IBM is a suitable procedure that encompasses the advantages of both closed and open mastoidectomy techniques.\r"

Children ages 1 to 8 years who were family contacts of patients hospitalized with culture-confirmed cholera were visited within 24 hours of the hospitalization and daily for 10 days, queried for the presence of diarrhea and cultured for V. cholerae O1. On Day 1 each child was weighed and saliva was collected to measure total IgA. On Days 1 and 21 blood was taken to assess vibriocidal and antitoxin titers, and on Days 1 and 2 B subunit or placebo was given orally as part of a trial to look for a toxin-blocking effect. Of 412 children enrolled in the study 35% (143) became infected with V. cholerae O1 and 49% (70) of these developed diarrhea. Undernutrition, defined in a child as weight less than 70% of the Harvard reference weight-for-age, was not associated with colonization, disease or the duration or severity of cholera. Moreover well-nourished children did not differ from undernourished children in their concentrations of salivary total IgA, initial serum antitoxin or vibriocidal antibodies or in their serologic response to colonization, disease or B subunit. The immune system in its response to cholera appears to be quite resistant to nutritional insults. The good antitoxin response to B subunit among undernourished children is of particular importance in considering the use of future oral cholera vaccines in areas where such undernutrition is common.\r"

Twenty-one episodes were evaluated for efficacy of either of 2 interventions. In 13 patients the catheter was removed and amphotericin B therapy was begun (Group 1), and in 8 patients, the catheter was retained and amphotericin B therapy was begun (Group 2). Persistent candidemia beyond onset of intervention occurred in 2 of the 13 patients in Group 1 and in 6 of the 8 patients in Group 2 (P = 0.018). In Group 1, 2 of the 13 patients subsequently developed new complications of candidiasis, and no patient died of causes related to candidiasis. In Group 2, 3 of the 8 patients had resolution of persistent candidemia only after catheter removal, 3 developed new complications of candidiasis after initiation of amphotericin B and 2 died with systemic candidal infection. Only one of the catheters initially retained was maintained successfully beyond the second week of amphotericin B therapy. We conclude that adverse outcomes (persistent fungemia, morbidity and mortality) are associated with attempts to maintain central catheters in the presence of candidemia.\r"

Our results lead to the following conclusions: (i) Circularization of viral DNA plays no role in integration. The direct precursor to the integrated MLV provirus is a linear molecule. (ii) The initial step in the integration reaction is probably a cleavage that removes the terminal 2 bases from each 3' end of the viral DNA. This cleavage depends on a virally encoded protein, IN, that has previously been shown genetically to be required for integration. (iii) The resulting viral 3' ends are joined to target DNA to form the initial recombination intermediate.\r"

It is capable of enhancing the expression of a cis-linked test gene by up to 300-fold. This enhancer element is apparently developmental-stage-independent, as it is functional at the embryonic and the adult developmental stages in erythroid cells that are expressing the respective beta-like globin genes. The enhancer and globin promoter sequences work in synergy and are capable of conferring on a cis-linked gene the high transcriptional efficiency (enhancer function), erythroid specificity (enhancer and promoter functions), and developmental-stage specificity (promoter function) that are characteristic of the in vivo transcription of the beta-like globin genes in erythroid cells.\r"

Complete inhibition of GDP binding by both reagents establishes that arginine is one of the critical amino acid residues involved in the binding of GDP. Reconstitution of the uncoupling protein (both unmodified and modified) into phospholipid vesicles by our procedure showed no effect of phenylglyoxal modification on the H+ conductance, thus demonstrating that the proton translocation site is structurally different and distinct from the GDP binding site.\r"

The N- and C-terminal halves of brain hexokinase show extensive sequence similarity to each other and to yeast hexokinase. These results provide direct support for the proposal that the mammalian hexokinases of approximately 100 kDa have evolved by a process of duplication and fusion of a gene encoding an ancestral hexokinase similar to the yeast enzyme of approximately 50 kDa. Taking this similarity in sequence to indicate basic similarity in structure between the N- and C-terminal regions of brain hexokinase and the yeast enzyme, a proposed structure for the mammalian hexokinase has been developed by fusing two molecules of yeast hexokinase, whose structure has previously been determined by x-ray crystallographic studies. Various features of the model are shown to be consistent with experimental observations bearing on the structure of the brain enzyme.\r"

The tandemly repeated U1 genes are expressed in morula and continue to be expressed at high rates until 2 hr after hatching, at which time the rate of expression of all the U1 genes and the tandemly repeated U1 genes declines sharply. By the gastrula stage the synthesis of total U1 RNA has declined by a factor of 8. The major tandemly repeated genes are inactive by this time, although other U1 genes remain active. The sequence of U1 RNA synthesized late in embryonic development differs from the sequence of U1 RNA encoded by the tandemly repeated set of U1 RNA genes, indicating that there must be other U1 RNA genes that are active late in embryonic development.\r"

The clone hybridized to a 1.8-kilobase mRNA from developing seedlings and from young leaves of mature plants. The identity of the clone was confirmed when extracts of transformed Escherichia coli expressed a protein containing tryptophan decarboxylase enzyme activity. The tryptophan decarboxylase cDNA clone encodes a protein of 500 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 56,142 Da. The amino acid sequence shows a high degree of similarity with the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (dopa decarboxylase) and the alpha-methyldopa-hypersensitive protein of Drosophila melanogaster.

Other potential minor initiation sites were found. The putative promoter region contains no TATA and CCAAT sequences in the expected positions upstream of the major transcription initiation site but contains multiple GC boxes within a (G + C)-rich region, as does the immediate 5' region of the first intron. Characteristics common to the 5' end of the human 5-lipoxygenase gene and the promoter regions of the housekeeping genes raise important questions concerning the regulation of 5-lipoxygenase gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Eukaryotic cells contain a 700-kDa proteolytic complex (the \"proteasome\" or multicatalytic endopeptidase complex), whose role in intracellular protein breakdown is unclear. It has been suggested that the proteasome functions in the rapid degradation of oxidant-damaged proteins and in the ATP-dependent proteolytic pathway. To test these possibilities, oxidant-damaged hemoglobin and albumin were produced by treating hemoglobin and albumin with phenylhydrazine, with hydroxyl radicals, or with both hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. After oxidant damage, these proteins were degraded more rapidly in erythrocyte extracts and also by the purified proteasome. However, complete removal of proteasomes from these extracts by immunoprecipitation (or inhibitors of its proteolytic activity) did not reduce the breakdown of oxidant-damaged hemoglobin and decreased degradation of hydroxyl- and superoxide-treated proteins by only 30-40%. Thus, erythrocytes must contain another proteolytic system for degradation of oxidant-damaged proteins. In contrast, immunoprecipitation of proteasomes with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies prevented the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent degradation of lysozyme and also blocked the ATP-stimulated degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated lysozyme in reticulocyte and skeletal muscle extracts. These data indicate a critical role of the proteasome in the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and suggest that the proteasome is associated with or is a component of the larger ubiquitin-conjugate-degrading enzyme complex.\r"

To study DNA methylation, the total uncloned genomic DNA, digested with a restriction endonuclease is subjected to a cytosine-specific hydrazine reaction and chemical cleavage. The DNA fragments of interest are linearly amplified with Taq polymerase and a sequence-specific radioactivity labeled synthetic primer. Following amplification, the DNA fragments are separated on a sequencing gel that is directly autoradiographed. To study protein-DNA interactions in vivo, we use a similar method, except that the DNA of interest is isolated from cells treated either with dimethyl sulfate or UV light. The resolution power of this technique is demonstrated by two examples, which have been studied previously by the conventional methods of genomic sequencing and \"footprinting.\"\r"

  ".W": "The trypanosomatid metabolite N1,N8-bis-(glutathionyl)spermidine (trypanothione) has been demonstrated to form a stable adduct with the aromatic arsenical drug melarsen oxide [p-(4,6-diamino-s-triazinyl-2-yl)aminophenyl arsenoxide]. The stability constant of the melarsen-trypanothione adduct (Mel T) has been determined to be 1.05 x 10(7) M-1. When bloodstream Trypanosoma brucei are incubated with either melarsen oxide or the 2,3-dimercaptopropanol adduct of melarsen oxide (melarsoprol), Mel T is the only arsenical derivative detectable in acid-soluble extracts of the cells. Trypanothione may therefore be regarded as a primary target for aromatic arsenical derivatives against African trypanosomes. The selective toxic action of these compounds might arise through sequestration of intracellular trypanothione in the form of Mel T, or Mel T itself may be toxic within the cell. The latter possibility is illustrated by the finding that Mel T is an inhibitor of trypanothione reductase from T. brucei (Ki = 9.0 microM)--an enzyme that is central to the regulation of the thiol/disulfide redox balance in the parasite and absent from the host.\r"

  ".W": "We report proton NMR studies on DNA oligonucleotides that contain A tracts of lengths known to produce various degrees of bending. Spectra of duplexes in the series 5'-(GGCAnCGG).(CCGTnGCC) (n = 3, 4, 5, 7, 9) reveal substantial structural changes within the An.Tn tract as its length is increased. Chemical-shift comparisons show that A tracts with fewer than about seven members do not contain regions of uniform [or poly(dA).poly(dT)-like] structure. Long An tracts (n greater than or equal to 7) appear to consist of an internal segment of homopolymeric conformation flanked by regions of transitional structure that occupy about four A.T pairs on the 5' side and two A.T pairs perhaps the directly adjacent G.C pair on the 3' side. In shorter duplexes (n less than 7), these two transitional regions overlap and an apparent mutual incompatibility causes length-dependent changes that are most pronounced near the 3' end. Throughout the series, there is a striking monotonic relationship between the location of an A.T pair in the A tract and the relative position of its ThyH3 resonance. The direction of the chemical-shift dispersion is opposite to that expected from consideration of ring-current effects alone; this discrepancy suggests a gradual decrease in ThyH3...N1Ade hydrogen-bond length as one moves from the 5' to the 3' end of the A tract and from short to long A tracts. Nuclear Overhauser effect measurements reveal that the interproton distances AdeH2...H1'Ade and AdeH2...H1'Thy vary along each A tract, except in the central regions of the longer ones where they are fairly constant and in good agreement with the poly(dA).poly(dT) structure proposed by Lipanov, A.A. & Chuprina, V. P. [(1987) Nucleic Acids Res. 15, 5833-5844]. This model features a substantial negative base-pair tilt, which has been suggested previously as the source of A-tract bending. In contrast, the nuclear Overhauser effect distances are inconsistent with at least one known crystallographic A-tract structure [DiGabriele, A. D., Sanderson, M. R. & Steitz, T. A. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 1816-1820], which lacks appreciable base-pair tilt.\r"

An Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide is found within filamentous hemagglutinin that may be involved in its adherence properties. An internal in-frame deletion in fhaB, encompassing the RGD region, causes loss of B. pertussis-binding to ciliated eukaryotic cells, confirming a potential role for this protein in host-cell binding and infection.\r"

We have now found that adenosine residues have been modified in the RNA products of this unwinding activity. Although the modified RNA remains double-stranded, the modification causes the RNA to be susceptible to single-strand-specific RNase and to migrate as a retarded smear on a native polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. The modification is specific for double-stranded RNA. At least 40% of the adenosine residues can be modified in vitro in a given random sequence RNA molecule. By using standard two-dimensional TLC and HPLC analyses, the modified base has been identified as inosine. Mismatched base-pairing between inosine and uridine appears to be responsible for the observed characteristics of the unwound RNA. The biological significance of this modifying activity and also of the modified double-stranded RNA is discussed.\r"

The chemical-shift differences result from different ionic and/or hydrogen-bonding interactions between amino acid side chains and the fatty acid carboxyl carbon. Rapid exchange of fatty acid among binding sites obscures these sites at temperatures greater than 30 degrees C. Rate constants for exchange at 33 degrees C were 350 sec-1 for octanoate and 20 sec-1 for decanoate, corresponding to lifetimes in a binding site of 2.8 msec (octanoate) and 50 msec (decanoate). Temperature-dependent data for octanoate showed an activation energy of 2 kcal/mol for exchange. Spectra of albumin complexes with the 12-carbon saturated fatty acid, lauric acid, had several narrow laurate carboxyl peaks at 35 degrees C, indicating longer lifetimes (tau much greater than 66 msec) in the different binding sites. Fatty acid exchange between albumin and model membranes (phosphatidylcholine bilayers) occurred on a time scale comparable to that for exchange among albumin binding sites, following the order octanoate greater than decanoate greater than laurate. The equilibrium distribution of fatty acid between lipid bilayers and protein was measured directly from NMR spectra. Decreasing pH (8.0 to 5.5) increased the relative affinity of fatty acid for the lipid bilayer. The results predict that the relative affinity of octanoic acid for albumin and membranes will be similar to that of long-chain fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid), but the rate of equilibration will be approximately 10(4) faster for octanoic acid.\r"

In the context of simple tetrahedral lattice protein models, these unique native helix bundle motifs can be obtained by a set of interactions similar to those found in previous simulations of the folding of four-member alpha-helical bundles with tight bends and beta-barrel proteins including the Greek key motif. The essential features sufficient to produce the four-helix bundle motif with long loops are as follows: (i) a general pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic type residues which differentiate the interior from the exterior of the molecule; (ii) the existence of hydrophilic regions in the amino acid sequence that, on the basis of short-range interactions, are indifferent to loop formation but that interact favorably with all the exterior residues of the helix bundle. Thus, these simulations indicate that, to reproduce all varieties of the left-handed four-helix bundle motif, site-specific interactions are not required.\r"

As such, they may be important in cardiac development and disease. To determine whether cardiac myocytes contain fibroblast growth factors, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were studied in primary culture and compared to primary cultures of nonmyocyte cardiac cells. Northern blot analysis revealed a 4.0-kilobase mRNA in myocytes that hybridized to acidic fibroblast growth factor cDNA and was not detectable in nonmyocyte cultures. Western blot analysis demonstrated the accumulation of a 15-kDa peptide with immunological identity to acidic fibroblast growth factor in extracts of extracellular matrix from myocyte cultures that was not detectable in similar extracts of nonmyocyte extracellular matrix. No acidic fibroblast growth factor-like protein was detectable in cellular lysates from either myocyte or nonmyocyte cultures. These results demonstrate that neonatal cardiac myocytes express acidic fibroblast growth factor mRNA and deposit a protein with immunological identity to acidic fibroblast growth factor into the extracellular matrix. The results suggest that acidic fibroblast growth factor produced by cardiac myocytes may mediate, through both paracrine and autocrine mechanisms, such diverse processes as myocyte differentiation, cellular proliferation, and vascular growth in the heart.\r"

Human, mouse, and rabbit macrophages degraded 125I-labeled PLC-LDL (125I-PLC-LDL) more rapidly than native 125I-labeled LDL (125I-LDL), while nonphagocytic cells such as human fibroblasts and bovine aortic endothelial cells degraded 125I-PLC-LDL more slowly than 125I-LDL. This suggested the mechanism for internalization of PLC-LDL was phagocytosis. When examined by electron microscopy, mouse peritoneal macrophages appeared to be phagocytosing PLC-LDL. The uptake and degradation of 125I-PLC-LDL by human macrophages was inhibited greater than 80% by the monoclonal antibody C7 (IgG2b) produced by hybridoma C7, which blocks the ligand binding domain of the LDL receptor. Similarly, methylation of 125I-LDL (125I-MeLDL) prior to treatment with phospholipase C decreased its subsequent uptake and degradation by human macrophages by greater than 90%. The uptake and degradation of phospholipase C-modified 125I-MeLDL by macrophages could be restored by incubation of the methylated lipoprotein with apoprotein E, a ligand recognized by the LDL receptor. These results indicate that macrophages internalize PLC-LDL by LDL receptor-dependent phagocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "125I-labeled angiogenin binds rapidly to the plasma membrane of several cell lines at 37 degrees C (t1/2 less than 1 min) but in comparatively small amounts. Competition with unlabeled angiogenin varies markedly with different cell lines, being most effective in vascular smooth muscle and fibroblast cells. Angiogenin modulates mitogenic stimuli in bovine adrenal capillary endothelial (BACE), rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM), and fibroblast (3T3) cells. Thus, it enhances the mitogenic effect of certain conditioned media on RASM and 3T3 cells, but it inhibits the mitogenic effect on BACE cells. In RASM and 3T3 cells, mitogenesis is increased at low (less than 5 ng/ml) and high (greater than 100 ng/ml) but not at intermediate concentrations of angiogenin. Plasma membranes from RASM and 3T3 cells that have been treated with angiogenin show an enhanced in vitro synthesis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) with an angiogenin concentration dependence similar to that of enhanced mitogenesis. PtdInsP2 synthesis arises by activation of a fatty acid (arachidonyl) coenzyme A synthetase and either a plasma membrane fatty acid acyltransferase or phosphatidylinositol kinase(s), or both. Increased PtdInsP2 or the derived second messengers (e.g., diacylglycerol) may mediate modulation of the mitogenic stimulus. The differential mitogenic interaction of angiogenin with several cell types, either stimulation or inhibition, probably reflects the multistep nature of angiogenesis.\r"

Fractional contribution of pentose shunt and absolute flux of glucose in glycolysis were measured in fasted or fed anemones acclimated to 5 degrees C or 15 degrees C. When fed, anemones of genotype Gpiss routed a greater fraction of glucose through the shunt than did Gpiff anemones; the effect was more pronounced at 5 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. This confirms predictions from kinetic and population data and is consistent with thermal selection maintaining the variation. Relative levels of shunt metabolism increased at 5 degrees C, compared with 15 degrees C, in fed anemones regardless of genotype, but the proportion of glucose metabolized by the pentose shunt was unchanged by temperature in fasted anemones. Glucose flux through the shunt was constant at approximately 5 pmol.mg-1.hr-1 in fed anemones at 5 degrees C and 15 degrees C and in fasted anemones at 15 degrees C, indicating apparently near-perfect thermal acclimation of the absolute flux of glucose through the shunt in fed, but not in fasted, anemones. Rates of glucose oxidation and flux through the shunt in freshly collected anemones were similar to those of anemones fed and acclimated at 15 degrees C in the laboratory. If these differences affect organismal-level processes, Gpi variation could contribute to Darwinian fitness in thermally varying environments.\r"

To increase the analytical power of this technique, we applied size fractionation of genomic DNA restriction fragments in conjunction with their sequence-dependent separation in denaturing gradient gels; the two-dimensional separation patterns obtained were subsequently transferred to nylon membranes. Hybridization analysis using minisatellite core sequences as probes resulted in two-dimensional genomic DNA fingerprints with a resolution of up to 625 separated spots per probe per human individual; by conventional Southern blot analysis, only 20-30 bands can be resolved. Using the two-dimensional DNA fingerprinting technique, we demonstrate in a small human pedigree the simultaneous transmission of 37 polymorphic fragments (out of 365 spots) for probe 33.15 and 105 polymorphic fragments (out of 625 spots) for probe 33.6. In addition, a mutation was detected in this pedigree by probe 33.6. We anticipate that this method will be of great use in studies aimed at (i) measuring human mutation frequencies, (ii) associating genetic variation with disease, (iii) analyzing genomic instability in relation to cancer and aging, and (iv) linkage analysis and mapping of disease genes.\r"

To understand why the GUAGUA element of U2 is conserved in evolution but the branch site is not, we have devised two different competitive assays for branch-site selection using the first intron of the human beta-globin gene. We find that a sequence resembling UACUAAC is the most efficient branch site for mammalian mRNA splicing both in vivo and in vitro. Our results suggest that in mammals U2 snRNA can form base pairs with the branch site and the interaction between U2 and the branch site can be augmented or replaced by an interaction between the spliceosome and some other element of the intron or exons, perhaps the conserved polypyrimidine tract located immediately upstream from the 3' splice site.\r"

This method allows direct detection of the normal or the sickle cell beta-globin allele in genomic DNA without additional steps of probe hybridization, ligation, or restriction enzyme cleavage. Two allele-specific oligonucleotide primers, one specific for the sickle cell allele and one specific for the normal allele, together with another primer complementary to both alleles were used in the polymerase chain reaction with genomic DNA templates. The allele-specific primers differed from each other in their terminal 3' nucleotide. Under the proper annealing temperature and polymerase chain reaction conditions, these primers only directed amplification on their complementary allele. In a single blind study of DNA samples from 12 individuals, this method correctly and unambiguously allowed for the determination of the genotypes with no false negatives or positives. If ASPCR is able to discriminate all allelic variation (both transition and transversion mutations), this method has the potential to be a powerful approach for genetic disease diagnosis, carrier screening, HLA typing, human gene mapping, forensics, and paternity testing.\r"

This method follows digestion of genomic DNA with restriction endonucleases, denaturation in alkaline solution, and electrophoresis on a neutral polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to a nylon membrane, the mobility shift due to a nucleotide substitution of a single-stranded DNA fragment could be detected by hybridization with a nick-translated DNA fragment or more clearly with RNA copies synthesized on each strand of the DNA fragment as probes. As the mobility shift caused by nucleotide substitutions might be due to a conformational change of single-stranded DNAs, we designate the features of single-stranded DNAs as single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs). Like restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), SSCPs were found to be allelic variants of true Mendelian traits, and therefore they should be useful genetic markers. Moreover, SSCP analysis has the advantage over RFLP analysis that it can detect DNA polymorphisms and point mutations at a variety of positions in DNA fragments. Since DNA polymorphisms have been estimated to occur every few hundred nucleotides in the human genome, SSCPs may provide many genetic markers.\r"

In this paper, we describe a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia showing the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 gene on chromosome 18 to immunoglobulin lambda light chain (Ig lambda) gene on chromosome 22 in a head-to-head configuration. Sequencing analysis of the joining site of the bcl-2 gene and Ig lambda gene has shown that the breakpoint is within the 5' flanking region of the bcl-2 gene and about 2.2 kilobases 5' to the joining segment of Ig lambda locus in a germ-line configuration. The extranucleotide, commonly appearing at the joining site of the t(14;18) translocation involving the IgH locus, is absent from the joining site of bcl-2 and Ig lambda. The lack of extranucleotide suggests that the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 and Ig lambda genes occurred during physiological rearrangement of the Ig lambda gene since it has been shown that the rearrangement of the Ig lambda locus is not accompanied by extranucleotides.\r"

  ".W": "Bacterial populations have served as model systems for studying evolutionary processes ever since the classic experiments of Luria and Delbruck, which demonstrated the occurrence of mutations prior to selection for the traits they conferred. However, several authors have recently presented experiments suggesting that bacteria may have mechanisms for directing which mutations occur, such that the rate of adaptive mutations is enhanced. Before the hypothesis of directed mutation is accepted, it is imperative to consider alternative hypotheses that might account for the same observations. To this end, we expand upon existing mathematical theory of the dynamics of mutation and selection in clonal populations for two cases of particular interest. The first case concerns selection against mutants before plating; this selection occurs as the result of differences in growth rate between mutants and nonmutants. We demonstrate that this selection model gives rise to distributions of mutants, obtained by plating from sister cultures, that are very similar to those expected when some mutations are induced by the selective environment. The second case concerns the sequential incorporation of two mutations as the result of selection for an intermediate genotype after plating. We demonstrate that this two-step mutation model also yields distributions that are similar to those expected when some mutations are induced by the selective environment. These two cases therefore provide alternatives to the hypothesis of directed mutation. We suggest experiments that might be used to examine our alternative hypotheses. We also contrast the hypothesis of directed mutation with the notion of inheritance of acquired characteristics.\r"

  ".U": "89202413\r", 
  ".W": "The amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal half of the complement protein C6 has been found to show overall structural homology with the homologous regions of the channel-forming proteins C7, C8 alpha, C8 beta, and C9. In addition, two specific cysteine-rich segments common to the amino-terminal regions of C7, C8 alpha, C8 beta, and C9 also occur in their expected positions in C6, suggesting functional significance. Two cDNA clones encoding C6 were isolated from a human liver library in the bacteriophage vector lambda gt11. The predicted protein sequence contains an apparent initiation methionine and a putative signal peptide of 21 residues, as well as a site for N-glycosylation at residue 303. The sequence of the C6 protein reported here has 47-52% similarity with C7, C8 alpha, C8 beta, and C9, as well as 31-38% similarity with thrombospondin, thrombomodulin, and low density lipoprotein receptor. The sequence data have been interpreted by using computer algorithms for estimation of average hydrophobicity and secondary structure.\r"
