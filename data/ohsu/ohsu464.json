Its activity has been detected in yeast, insects and Escherichia coli as well as in mammals, and it is though to be essential for protein folding during protein synthesis in the cell. We purified PPIase from pig kidney and found that its amino-acid sequence is identical to that reported for bovine cyclophilin, a protein known to bind the immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporin A (ref. 5). To investigate the functional relationship between PPIase and cyclophilin we examined the effect of cyclosporin A on PPIase activity and found that it was inhibitory. Thus we propose that the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerizing activity of PPIase may be involved in events, such as those occurring early in T-cell activation, that are suppressed by cyclosporin A.\r"

On the basis of the conserved Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly sequence at the putative protease active sites, and other biochemical evidence, retroviral proteases have been predicted to be in the family of pepsin-like aspartic proteases. It has been suggested that aspartic proteases evolved from a smaller, dimeric ancestral protein, and a recent model of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease postulated that a symmetric dimer of this enzyme is equivalent to a pepsin-like aspartic protease. We have now determined the crystal structure of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) protease at 3-A resolution and find it is dimeric and has a structure similar to aspartic proteases. This structure should provide a useful basis for the modelling of the structures of other retroviral proteases, such as that of HIV, and also for the rational design of protease inhibitors as potential antiviral drugs.\r"

A sustained, significant elevation of testosterone levels was produced but there was no effect on any measurement of muscle strength.

These findings suggest that cholinergic drugs might be an effective treatment for this disease. We studied the efficacy of RS-86, a direct cholinergic agonist, upon motor abilities, eye movements, and psychometric performance in 10 patients with PSP during a 9-week placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial. Glycopyrrolate, a peripheral anticholinergic drug, was given throughout the trial to minimize cholinergic side effects. We used changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep to assess the degree of cholinergic activation achieved by treatment. Despite the enhancement of cholinergic activity in the CNS as indicated by increases in REM sleep latency and REM sleep time, RS-86 did not improve motor signs, eye movements, or cognition. Pharmacologic replacement of the cholinergic deficits in PSP does not result in significant clinical benefit.\r"

Thereafter, asymptomatic patients were randomized to receive monthly prophylactic vaginal tablets of clotrimazole 500 mg or placebo once a month. During the prophylactic phase, patients receiving placebo developed recurrences of symptomatic candida vaginitis at an extremely high rate, such that only one-third remained asymptomatic at the end of 6 months. In comparison, patients receiving clotrimazole demonstrated moderate protection from recurrence; which was maximal and statistically significant during the first 3 months of prophylaxis only (P less than .05). During the prophylactic period overall, attack rates were reduced by one-third with clotrimazole. No adverse reactions were observed with the administration of clotrimazole. In summary, clotrimazole therapy was successful in inducing an initial therapeutic response, but achieved only a modest long-term protective effect. Additional clinical benefit may be possible with more frequent clotrimazole prophylactic administration.\r"

The protocol was closed in May 1986 because the modified CHAMOMA regimen was significantly more toxic and possibly less effective. There were 42 patients entered, with 22 receiving MAC and 20 receiving modified CHAMOMA. There have been six deaths due to disease in the modified CHAMOMA group and none in the MAC group. Five MAC failures and one modified CHAMOMA failure have been rescued by surgery and/or chemotherapy. All six of the patients who died on the modified CHAMOMA regimen had developed disease following a previous term pregnancy, but none had prior chemotherapy. All seven patients who were treated for gestational trophoblastic disease after term pregnancy in the MAC group were cured of disease. With the modified CHAMOMA regimen, 44% of patients had life-threatening hematologic toxicity, as compared with only 9% of the MAC patients. Thus, the standard MAC regimen appears to be at least equally effective and much less toxic than the modified CHAMOMA regimen, indicating a more favorable therapeutic index.\r"

Fifty patients with persistent late decelerations and 50 gestational age-matched controls with reactive tracings underwent umbilical velocimetry with measurement of S/D ratios. The mean (+/- SD) S/D ratio in the late-deceleration group (4.32 +/- 1.1) was significantly higher than that of the control group (2.32 +/- 0.21) (P less than .01). Patients with late decelerations had a significantly higher incidence of adverse pregnancy outcome, as judged by the incidence of small for gestational age infants, meconium, cesarean section for fetal distress, low Apgar scores, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions, compared with the control group. However, there was no difference in the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcome in the late-deceleration group with normal S/D ratios compared with controls. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of S/D ratios in the late-deceleration group for predicting adverse pregnancy outcome were 85.7, 100, 100, and 89.6%, respectively. These data suggest that umbilical velocimetry might be able to discriminate late decelerations that constitute a false-positive test. Incorporation of umbilical velocimetry into antepartum and intrapartum fetal surveillance schemes may therefore be helpful.\r"

We evaluated tensile strength in 36 uterine muscle specimens containing the scar obtained from nine animals in the 28-32-days post-surgery group. Of these 36 specimens, 86.1% tore through the muscle instead of through the scar when tension was applied to the muscle.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to compare prospectively the parameters of morbidity, cost, length of hospital stay, and fertility outcome after linear salpingostomy by laparoscopy versus laparotomy. Entry criteria included stable vital signs, hematocrit greater than 30%, age over 18 years, and desire for future fertility. All patients underwent diagnostic laparoscopy. Sixty patients with unruptured ectopic gestations of 5 cm or smaller were randomized to either laparoscopy (N = 30) or laparotomy (N = 30). Postoperative follow-up included serial measurements of serum beta-hCG titers at 3-day intervals and hysterosalpingography at 12 weeks. The laparoscopy and laparotomy groups were similar in age, height, weight, gravidity, gestational age, hematocrit, ectopic pregnancy size, and preoperative beta-hCG levels. The estimated blood loss was significantly (P less than .001) lower in patients undergoing laparoscopy, and was not affected by vasopressin injection. Two patients in the laparoscopy group required laparotomy for hemostasis, and two patients undergoing laparotomy had wound infection. One patient in each group had persistent trophoblastic activity. Baseline serum beta-hCG levels and the rate and magnitude of postoperative beta-hCG decline were similar in both groups. The length of hospital stay was significantly (P less than .001) shorter after laparoscopic salpingostomy (1.4 +/- 0.1 days) than after laparotomy (3.3 +/- 0.2 days). Postoperative hysterosalpingography showed patency of the involved tube in 16 of 20 (80%) and 17 of 19 (89%) of patients in the laparoscopy and laparotomy groups, respectively. Pregnancy rates were ten of 18 (56%) and 11 of 19 (58%) in these groups, respectively, and all pregnancies were conceived within 6 months of surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Scans from 22 cases of pathologically proved partial hydatidiform mole and 33 cases of first-trimester missed abortion were independently reviewed by three radiologists, each unaware of the final pathologic diagnosis. Using a standard data form, each radiologist recorded the dimensions, shape, and contents of the gestational sac, the sonographic appearance of the decidual reaction/placenta and myometrium, and the presence or absence of adnexal cysts. The following two criteria were found to be significantly associated (P less than .05) with the diagnosis of partial mole: 1) ratio of transverse to anteroposterior dimension of the gestational sac greater than 1.5, and 2) cystic changes, irregularity, or increased echogenicity in the decidual reaction/placenta or myometrium. There was high interobserver correlation for both criteria, as measured by the kappa statistic. In 50% of the cases, either both or neither of these criteria were met. When both criteria were met, the frequency of partial mole was 87%; when neither criterion was met, the frequency of missed abortion was 90%. These results indicate that ultrasound can be of value in predicting a high likelihood of partial mole prior to curettage.\r"

  ".W": "A new technique is presented for funipuncture under ultrasound guidance using a biopsy guide and a 20/25-gauge needle combination. The 20-gauge needle was used for uterine entry and the 25-gauge needle for the actual cord puncture. The method was used for sampling fetal blood in 262 pregnancies with 264 fetuses (two sets of twins) between 17-39 weeks, at risk for beta-thalassemia, chromosomal disorders, TORCH infection, fetal hypoxia, and Rh-isoimmunization. Pure fetal blood was aspirated from 241 fetuses (91.3%), including the twins. The procedure lasted less than 5 minutes in 76.5% of the cases and less than 10 minutes in 90.1% of the cases. Intra-amniotic bleeding was seen in only 23.1% of the cases, and fetal bradycardia was not noted. Forty-four pregnancies were terminated after the diagnosis of genetic or infectious disease. Seven fetuses at risk for Rh-isoimmunization, found to be Rh-positive and anemic, were transfused immediately after blood sampling using the same needle. Of the 220 continuing pregnancies, there were 14 fetal losses (three before 28 weeks and 11 after 28 weeks or during the perinatal period). A probable etiology for the loss was found in 11 cases. These included one severely Rh-isoimmunized hydropic fetus who died in utero after transfusion at 26 weeks, one fetus who died in utero at 31 weeks following a car accident, and nine malformed newborns. The corrected rate for fetal losses probably related to the procedure was thus 0.9% before 28 weeks and 0.8% after 28 weeks. This new funipuncture technique seems to have several advantages over the freehand and/or biopsy-guided single-needle techniques.\r"

Present systems rely on subjective criteria that are prone to bias and error. This report describes an objective technique for the measurement of surface area of pelvic endometriotic implants that is both accurate and reproducible. Six patients with endometriosis underwent laparoscopy and were staged using the Revised American Fertility Society criteria; the lesions were photographed simultaneously. These patients were then treated with either danazol or Nafarelin acetate for 6 months before a second-look laparoscopy. Using coded photographic slides, implants were measured using computerized morphometric analysis. An accurate record of the number and surface area of the lesions was obtained before and after treatment. The mean surface area of individual lesions and the total visible disease per patient fell by 89 and 82%, respectively. The mean number of lesions per patient actually rose by 30% as a result of fragmentation into smaller plaques. These data suggest that morphometry may be more valuable in the assessment of endometriotic implants than are all previously described staging systems.\r"

The pathology consists of a collection of subcutaneous lymphatic cisterns communicating through dilated channels with superficial clusters of vesicles. The most common symptom is recurrent oozing of clear fluid. Management consists of wide excision, assuring free lateral and deep margins by frozen-section analysis. Involved margins have been shown to increase the recurrence rate. Laser vaporization has been used recently with relatively good results. The etiology of this lesion is unclear; however, lymphatic obstruction has been suggested as a possible cause in occasional cases. Two cases of vulvar lymphangioma circumscriptum have been reported previously in the literature, both arising in elderly women after radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. We present the third case, arising in a 42-year-old woman with no previous surgery or radiation.\r"

The purpose of this study was to review the available literature to determine whether there is an association between genital colonization with Mycoplasma hominis or Ureaplasma urealyticum and prematurity/LBW. Twelve studies were reviewed: nine cohort studies, two case-control studies, and one randomized clinical trial of treatment. The overall isolation rate of M hominis from the genital tract was 27.2%, whereas that of U urealyticum was 70.4% (cohort studies). Results from the randomized clinical trial showed that treatment did not alter the rate of prematurity in women carrying mycoplasma species in the genital tract. None of the cohort studies supported an association between genital colonization with U urealyticum and prematurity/LBW. Similarly, no association between M hominis and prematurity/LBW could be demonstrated in seven of the eight and in six of the eight cohort studies, respectively. On the other hand, two case-control studies showed an association between U urealyticum colonization and prematurity without an association with M hominis. We conclude that the weight of the evidence does not support an association between genital colonization with mycoplasma species and prematurity/LBW.\r"

When used in combination, the thiazide diuretics and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to improve blood pressure reduction over either drug used alone. In addition, the combination is effective in a wide range of patient populations (blacks and whites, young and old) and is accompanied by fewer adverse metabolic effects than the thiazides alone.

Some problems, such as alcohol abuse or inappropriate use of certain medications, may be revealed only with difficulty, and some of the problems mentioned may overlap.

Complete dissolution of stones can take months to years. Direct-contact dissolution therapy is rapidly effective, is inexpensive, and can be used for any size and number of gallstones. However, it is invasive, and only about 20% of patients are suitable candidates. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is noninvasive and avoids the complications and long recovery period of surgery. Up to three stones can be treated, but patients with certain medical conditions are excluded. About 20% to 30% of patients can undergo this treatment. None of these nonsurgical treatments prevents recurrence. Shock wave lithotripsy and dissolution with methyl tert-butyl ether are still in the experimental stage, so results of further study--particularly of combinations of the methods--are eagerly awaited by persons who have had symptomatic gallstones.\r"

  ".W": "2-Acetylpyridine 5-[(dimethylamino)thiocarbonyl]thiocarbonohydrazone (A1110U) was found to be a potent inactivator of the ribonucleotide reductases (EC 1.17.4.1) encoded by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and by varicella-zoster virus and to be a weaker inactivator of human ribonucleotide reductase. It also markedly potentiated the antiherpetic activity of acyclovir against these viruses in tissue culture. A1110U both decreased the dGTP pool that builds up when infected cells are treated with acyclovir and induced a large increase in the pool of acyclovir triphosphate. The resultant 100-fold increase in the ratio of the concentrations of acyclovir triphosphate to dGTP should facilitate the binding of the fraudulent nucleotide to its target enzyme, herpes virus-encoded DNA polymerase, and could account for the synergy between A1110U and acyclovir. A similar change in the acyclovir triphosphate-to-dGTP ratio was previously reported to be induced by another ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, 2-acetylpyridine 4-(2-morpholinoethyl)thiosemicarbazone (A723U). However, A1110U is considerably more potent and may have better clinical potential. Synergistic toxic interactions between A1110U and acyclovir were not detected in uninfected cells.\r"

  ".U": "89128857\r", 
  ".W": "AIDS is an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome defined by a severe depletion of T cells and over 20 conventional degenerative and neoplastic diseases. In the U.S. and Europe, AIDS correlates to 95% with risk factors, such as about 8 years of promiscuous male homosexuality, intravenous drug use, or hemophilia. Since AIDS also correlates with antibody to a retrovirus, confirmed in about 40% of American cases, it has been hypothesized that this virus causes AIDS by killing T cells. Consequently, the virus was termed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and antibody to HIV became part of the definition of AIDS. The hypothesis that HIV causes AIDS is examined in terms of Koch's postulates and epidemiological, biochemical, genetic, and evolutionary conditions of viral pathology. HIV does not fulfill Koch's postulates: (i) free virus is not detectable in most cases of AIDS; (ii) virus can only be isolated by reactivating virus in vitro from a few latently infected lymphocytes among millions of uninfected ones; (iii) pure HIV does not cause AIDS upon experimental infection of chimpanzees or accidental infection of healthy humans. Further, HIV violates classical conditions of viral pathology. (i) Epidemiological surveys indicate that the annual incidence of AIDS among antibody-positive persons varies from nearly 0 to over 10%, depending critically on nonviral risk factors. (ii) HIV is expressed in less than or equal to 1 of every 10(4) T cells it supposedly kills in AIDS, whereas about 5% of all T cells are regenerated during the 2 days it takes the virus to infect a cell. (iii) If HIV were the cause of AIDS, it would be the first virus to cause a disease only after the onset of antiviral immunity, as detected by a positive \"AIDS test.\" (iv) AIDS follows the onset of antiviral immunity only after long and unpredictable asymptomatic intervals averaging 8 years, although HIV replicates within 1 to 2 days and induces immunity within 1 to 2 months. (v) HIV supposedly causes AIDS by killing T cells, although retroviruses can only replicate in viable cells. In fact, infected T cells grown in culture continue to divide. (vi) HIV is isogenic with all other retroviruses and does not express a late, AIDS-specific gene. (vii) If HIV were to cause AIDS, it would have a paradoxical, country-specific pathology, causing over 90% Pneumocystis pneumonia and Kaposi sarcoma in the U.S. but over 90% slim disease, fever, and diarrhea in Africa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The proteasome (the multicatalytic endoproteinase complex) in mammalian tissues hydrolyzes proteins and several types of peptides. When this structure was isolated rapidly from rabbit skeletal muscle in the presence of glycerol, its various peptidase and protease activities showed a large reversible activation by physiological concentrations of ATP (Ka = 0.3-0.5 mM). Hydrolysis of succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-(4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide) was stimulated up to 12-fold by ATP, whereas degradation of casein and bovine serum albumin increased 4- to 7-fold. Neither ADP nor AMP had any effect. CTP, GTP, UTP, and the nonhydrolyzable analogs adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imino]triphosphate (AMPP[NH]P) and adenosine 5'-[alpha,beta-methylene]triphosphate (AMP[CH2]PP) increased peptide hydrolysis as well as ATP did. However, only ATP stimulated casein breakdown and only in the presence of Mg2+. Thus, nucleotide binding allows activation of the peptidase functions, but ATP hydrolysis seems necessary for enhanced degradation of proteins. The ATP effect on proteolysis was reversible and did not require ubiquitin. Sensitivity to ATP was labile, and with storage at 4 degrees C the enzyme became fully active in the absence of ATP or Mg2+. The ATP-activated form closely resembles the proteasome complex described previously, which did not show ATP dependence: both have molecular masses of 650 kDa, contain the same 8-10 subunits, and are precipitated by the same antibodies. A similar ATP-activated form was found in rabbit liver but not in rabbit reticulocytes. The proteasome seems to represent a ubiquitin-independent, ATP-stimulated proteolytic activity within nucleated mammalian cells.\r"

These resonances showed extra splitting or broadening due to the 13C label, which could be eliminated by 13C decoupling.

A genetic approach was used to facilitate the purification of biologically active Tat. A recombinant Tat protein containing a stretch of six histidine residues and a protease cleavage site was engineered and purified to greater than 95% homogeneity in a single step by immobilized metal-ion chromatography with a special affinity resin that has selectivity for proteins with neighboring histidine residues. A modified scrape loading method for introduction of protein into cell monolayers was used to demonstrate that the purified Tat retained biological activity. Tat function was completely blocked in the presence of transcription inhibitors, which demonstrates the requirement of ongoing mRNA synthesis for trans-activation. These studies indicate that the mechanism of trans-activation is unlikely to involve a direct action of Tat on mRNA stability, transport, or translation and provides the basis for a rapid assay that can be used to identify inhibitors of trans-activation. The methods described herein should be useful for the functional analysis of other proteins that do not confer activity through a receptor-mediated pathway.\r"

Despite the importance of these genes in controlling bacterial behavior, little is known of the molecular mechanisms that regulate their expression. We have identified a minor form of E. coli RNA polymerase that specifically transcribes several E. coli chemotaxis/flagellar genes in vitro and is likely to carry out transcription of these genes in vivo. The enzyme was purified to near homogeneity based on its ability to initiate transcription of the E. coli tar chemotaxis gene at start sites that are used in vivo. Specific tar transcription activity is associated with a polypeptide of apparent 28-kDa molecular mass that remains bound to the E. coli RNA polymerase throughout purification. This peptide behaves as a secondary sigma factor--designated sigma F--because it restores specific tar transcription activity when added to core RNA polymerase. The sigma F holoenzyme also transcribes the E. coli tsr and flaAI genes in vitro as well as several Bacillus subtilis genes that are transcribed specifically by the sigma 28 form of B. subtilis RNA polymerase. The latter holoenzyme is implicated in transcription of flagellar and chemotaxis genes in B. subtilis. Hence E. coli sigma F holoenzyme appears to be analogous to the B. subtilis sigma 28 RNA polymerase, both in its promoter specificity and in the nature of the regulon it controls.\r"

C. (1984) Nature (London) 309, 810-812]. Expression was under control of the lambda PL promoter and resulted in production of ferredoxin as a cleavable fusion protein with an amino-terminal fragment derived from bacteriophage lambda cII protein. The fusion protein was isolated from the soluble fraction of induced cells and was specifically cleaved to yield mature recombinant ferredoxin. The recombinant protein was shown to be identical in size to ferredoxin isolated from human placenta (13,546 Da) by NaDodSO4/PAGE and partial amino acid sequencing. E. coli cells expressing human ferredoxin were brown in color, and absorbance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the purified recombinant protein established that the [2Fe-2S] center was assembled and incorporated into ferredoxin in vivo. Recombinant ferredoxin was active in steroid hydroxylations when reconstituted with cytochromes P-450scc and P-450(11) beta and exhibited rates comparable to those observed for ferredoxin isolated from human placenta. This expression system should be useful in production of native and structurally altered forms of human ferredoxin for studies of ferredoxin structure and function.\r"

Characterizing the intermediate (I) crystal is a c-axis unit-cell dimension of 149 A, halfway between the c-axis length of the T (c = 142 A) and R (c = 156 A) states, in the space group P321. Preservation of the P321 space group indicates that the intermediate crystal form retains a threefold axis of symmetry, and therefore the enzyme has at minimum a threefold axis; however, we do not know whether the molecular twofold axis is conserved. The I crystals are formed by soaking T-state crystals with L-aspartate and phosphate. By raising the concentration of L-aspartate we can further transform the I crystals, without fragmentation, to a form that has the same unit-cell dimensions as R-state crystals grown in the presence of N-(phosphonoacetyl)-L-aspartate.\r"

It is composed of integral membrane proteins (enzyme II components) that recognize specific extracellular sugars as well as phosphocarrier proteins, one of which is called enzyme I. While enzyme I plays a role in energizing the enzyme II for sugar transfer, its precise cellular distribution had not previously been defined. This study was designed to elucidate the cellular location of this protein by immunoelectron microscopy. Enzyme I antibody bound to E. coli cryosections was visualized with protein A-gold. The gold particles in sections of wild-type E. coli were found primarily associated with the surface of the inner membrane. A strain of E. coli harboring a plasmid encoding the gene for enzyme I was also tested for its distribution of enzyme I. Consistent with the biochemically established overproduction of enzyme I, this strain showed an approximately 80-fold higher density of gold particles per unit cell volume than the wild-type cells. The substantial overproduction of immunoreactive enzyme I was associated with a significant (approximately 20-fold) increase in the amount of that protein bound to the inner membrane. In addition, a substantial fraction of the total enzyme I accumulated within a 60-nm-wide zone in the vicinity of the inner membrane. A model to explain the zonal distribution of enzyme I under conditions of overexpression of the protein is presented.\r"

Unstimulated platelets were shown to possess numerous phosphotyrosine-containing proteins by immunoblot analysis using antibodies that specifically recognize phosphotyrosine residues. To examine whether the pattern of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins changes upon platelet activation, lysates from thrombin- and phorbol ester-treated platelets were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Novel phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were detected within seconds following platelet stimulation.

The nicks introduced into the apoB backbone during postendocytic processing occur in yolk platelets and appear to prepare internalized VLDL for storage in yolk.

It encodes a protein that is very similar to the protein encoded by Ddras, but in contrast to Ddras, DdrasG is only expressed during growth and early development. Although other eukaryotic organisms possess more than one ras gene, Dictyostelium is thus far unique in expressing different ras genes at different stages of development. In Dictyostelium the two ras proteins may fulfill different functions, with the DdrasG protein playing a role during cell growth and the Ddras protein playing a role in signal transduction during multicellular development.\r"

  ".W": "To be virulent, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) must produce a toxin and a pilus-like structure that mediates specific attachment to host tissue. Expression of two of these specific adherence structures, CS1 and CS2, requires the presence of a plasmid in an ETEC strain of a particular serotype and biotype. We show here that this plasmid does not contain the structural gene for a pilin protein, as previously believed. Instead we have identified a plasmid-encoded gene called rns that is required for expression of CS1 or CS2 colonization factor antigens and for adhesion. The rns gene, defined by two separately isolated insertion mutations, produces a 26-kDa protein when transcribed and translated in vitro. At the protein level the rns gene product is homologous to AraC, a positive regulator of the arabinose operon of enteric bacteria, and to RhaR and RhaS, which regulate the rhamnose operon of E. coli. The homology of the Rns protein to AraC is localized to regions that are believed to bind to DNA. Moreover, the sequence of one of these homologous regions is consistent with a DNA binding helix-turn-helix motif. The average G + C content of E. coli DNA is 50%; yet the rns gene contains only 28% G + C, suggesting that it was acquired from some other organism.\r"

  ".W": "In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, origins of replication (autonomously replicating sequences; ARSs), centromeres, and telomeres have been isolated and characterized. The identification of these structures allows the construction of artificial chromosomes in which the architecture of eukaryotic chromosomes may be studied. A common feature of most, and possibly all, natural yeast chromosomes is that they have an ARS within 2 kilobases of their physical ends. To study the effects of such telomeric ARSs on chromosome maintenance, we introduced artificial chromosomes of approximately 15 and 60 kilobases into yeast cells and analyzed the requirements for telomeric ARSs and the effects of ARS-free chromosomal arms on the stability of these molecules. We find that terminal blocks of telomeric repeats are sufficient to be recognized as telomeres. Moreover, artificial chromosomes containing telomere-associated Y' sequences and telomeric ARSs were no more stable during both mitosis and meiosis than artificial chromosomes lacking terminal ARSs, indicating that yeast-specific blocks of telomeric sequences are the only cis-acting requirement for a functional telomere during both mitotic growth and meiosis. The results also show that there is no requirement for an origin of replication on each arm of the artificial chromosomes, indicating that a replication fork may efficiently move through a functional centromere region.\r"

Only 5.3% (four of 75) of renal cell carcinomas found during 1974-1977 but 25.4% (31 of 122) found during 1982-1985 were 3.0 cm or smaller, an increase of almost five times. Of the small tumors in the 1982-1985 group 96.7% (30 of 31) were incidentally discovered, and 77.4% (24 of 31) were initially detected with computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound (US). In the later series 48.4% (15 of 31) of the small renal tumors were treated with partial nephrectomy. Follow-up shows no recurrences. Many more small renal tumors are being detected because of the use of CT and US. This will undoubtedly increase the cure rate of renal cell carcinoma because these tumors are being detected when they are small and do not cause symptoms. Partial nephrectomy will increasingly be used in the management of these small tumors.\r"

Doppler signals were obtained from the inferior vena cava (IVC) and from hepatic, collateral, and portal veins. Normally, the IVC and hepatic veins show phasic forward (toward the heart) flow. In Budd-Chiari syndrome, the blood flow in the IVC and hepatic veins was absent, reversed, turbulent, or continuous. These Doppler findings were thought to be characteristic of Budd-Chiari syndrome. The portal velocity was reduced (n = 4) or increased (n = 1). The former was considered typical of Budd-Chiari syndrome. In hepatic venocclusive disease the IVC and major hepatic veins showed normal phasic flow; flow velocity in the portal vein was increased. Doppler sonography was found to correlate well with therapeutic results and angiographic findings.\r"

At reevaluation there was no indication of acute DVT. Thirty-two extremities had an appearance consistent with clot at the time of this study; 28 demonstrated normal findings. Variables that correlated with findings at follow-up US included age, location of clot, number of previous clots, pain, and augmentation of flow at compression.

In all cases, turbulent pulsatile venous flow was present at the site of the fistula and nonturbulent pulsatile venous flow was present proximal to the fistula. In five cases a focal area of apparent extravascular tissue vibration was identified. In four cases the communication between the artery and vein was identified.

Six patients underwent operation after percutaneous treatment due to persistent drainage. In patients with infected pseudocysts, the infection was eradicated by percutaneous drainage before operation. Four pseudocysts recurred and were redrained percutaneously. The mean duration of drainage was 19.6 days (infected pseudocysts, 16.7 days; noninfected, 21.2 days). Various access routes were used for catheter drainage: transperitoneal, retroperitoneal, transhepatic, transgastric, transduodenal, and transsplenic (inadvertent). Four major (superinfections) and six minor complications occurred. An unexpected finding in seven patients was spontaneous fistulization of the pseudocyst into the gastrointestinal tract. Percutaneous drainage is an effective front-line treatment for most pancreatic pseudocysts; cure is likely if fluid collections are drained adequately and if sufficient time is allowed for closure of fistulas from the pancreatic duct.\r"

This nonsurgical approach resulted in resolution of ascites, pleural effusion, and respiratory distress in both patients.

Fourteen cases were found at fetal screening, and the infants were asymptomatic. Inappropriate maternal/fetal intervention occurred in four cases: Three were incorrectly thought to have posterior urethral valves. The increased number of neonates found to have reflux is attributable to the widespread availability of obstetric ultrasonography and early screening of infants at risk for urinary tract abnormalities. Since the pathophysiologic characteristics of reflux are well understood, appropriate postnatal therapy can be instituted without delay.\r"

Superselective studies included injection of both thyrocervical trunks, both internal mammary arteries, and both common carotid arteries in all patients in whom this was technically possible. DSA findings were true positive in 16 patients (62%); CA findings were true positive in ten patients (38%) and equivocal in four (15%) (P less than .046). There were no false-positive angiograms.

In 21 patients suspected of having biliary complications, 31 diagnostic percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographic studies, 19 transhepatic biliary drainages, eight pressure-flow studies, five percutaneous drainages of abdominal fluid collections, 11 balloon dilations, and one basketing procedure were performed. Biliary complications were seen in 38% of allografts, with obstruction being more common than leakage. Complications were most frequent in patients with cholecystojejunostomy reconstructions. Only two children had biliary complications that were thought to be related to arterial compromise. No significant intervention was required in 17% of complications. Percutaneous techniques were associated with a low frequency of significant complications (6%). The authors conclude that interventional radiologic techniques can be used effectively in the evaluation and management of biliary complications in pediatric hepatic transplant recipients.\r"

Incurable malignancies can be palliated by each of these three approaches. None of these has an advantage in terms of longevity over the others. Choosing the procedure which offers the best quality of life for the individual patient is complex. The virulence of the underlying tumor, the anatomic location within the biliary tree, and the availability of expertise in each of the alternative methods must be considered. For the group of patients whose conditions are palliated with transhepatic biliary drainage, the choice between chronic indwelling internal-external catheter versus endoprosthesis placement involves questions of utility, patient acceptance, and the geometry of the obstructed biliary tree. Each of these must be considered before deciding on the approach which offers the best compromise of the technical preferences of the physician, the psychological preferences of the patient, and the limitations imposed by the level and number of obstructions. Research by radiologists and gastroenterologists has resulted in improved endoprosthesis function. Current research aimed at improving stability and patency promises further improvements in endoprosthesis efficacy.\r"

It is a different entity from tuberculous arthritis, which is usually monoarticular and is caused by direct tuberculin infection. Poncet's disease remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Thirteen cases have been reported in the English-language literature since 1974. All patients who received the Mantoux test reacted positively, and 10 of 11 patients treated with antituberculous drugs had resolution of arthritis on therapy. Poncet's disease and erythema nodosum could be differing expressions of a common immunopathogenic response to tuberculin.\r"

  ".U": "89129889\r", 
  ".W": "The epidemiology of medieval and early modern European plague remains highly controversial. It now seems likely that the epidemiology was not uniform throughout either the geographic or temporal boundaries of the plague in Western Europe. The Venetian plague of 1630 was extensively documented; day-by-day records were kept, and each mortality in the city was recorded in a set format. The days 23-25 October 1630, representing a period when mortality was beginning to increase sharply, are examined. In all, 1,163 deaths were recorded. They show a large preponderance of women; a mean age of 28, but a majority of cases clumped between ages 0 and 25 years; and an unequal sex ratio among children. Further, there was an identifiable smallpox epidemic raging simultaneously with plague, and more than one-quarter of all the deaths in this period of high mortality were clearly due to nonplague causes. Deaths due to wounds and associated with violence were prominent in one parish, which suggests that in times of plague the breakdown in the normal machinery of government, in everyday patterns of life, and possibly of mental well being resulted in an even more exaggerated death toll. These factors--violence, accidents, and other epidemics--have never been so definitively tied to a European plague epidemic. In addition, there are hints that plague has a marked proclivity to kill pregnant women--their deaths far outnumber those anticipated--and that plague was very localized at a given moment within Venice itself, even during times of peak mortality.\r"

Certain neurologic, cutaneous, and other syndromes observed in Europe were recognized in the 1920s and 1930s to be disabling sequelae of EM. In the 1940s and 1950s the effectiveness of penicillin as therapy for EM was demonstrated. In 1968 the first patient with EM and neurologic sequelae in North America benefited from treatment with penicillin. In 1975, an epidemic arthropathy appeared in the area of Lyme, Connecticut. Despite resemblance to EM (the initial appearance of cutaneous lesions), the complex was called Lyme disease because of the occurrence of cardiac, neurologic, and arthritic sequelae. The vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes dammini--a tick that harbors agents that cause Lyme disease and babesiosis--was identified and characterized in 1979. The spirochete that causes Lyme disease was designated Borrelia burgdorferi. The North American and European species of spirochete and the clinical syndromes to which they are related are described.\r"

Flow cytometry offers rapid and reproducible measurements of single cells in suspension and, following staining with one or more fluorochromes, simultaneous examination of several cell functions. Subpopulations of cells can be identified and sorted for morphologic, biochemical, and functional examination, and specially adapted computer systems allow storage of data for subsequent detailed analysis. Several flow-cytometric assays for the study of phagocytes and their interactions with microorganisms have been developed. These assays facilitate the study of (1) phagocyte surface receptors and regulatory molecules; (2) membrane potential; (3) phagocytosis of microorganisms, including the discrimination between attachment to the phagocyte surface and actual internalization; (4) phagosomal pH; (5) degranulation and enzymatic activity; (6) intracellular calcium; (7) oxidative metabolism; (8) intracellular killing of microorganisms; (9) degradation of microorganisms; and (10) exocytosis. In addition, the influence of serum opsonins on phagocyte-microorganism interactions can be studied. Flow-cytometric techniques are applicable to both experimental and clinical work.\r"

Eight pediatric cases of infection due to group C streptococci were identified in a retrospective survey of a recent 6-year period at a children's hospital. An additional case of group C meningitis diagnosed in 1975 was included. These nine cases and 22 pediatric cases from the literature are presented to illustrate important points with respect to clinical presentations and complications and to show that these organisms can cause serious, sometimes fatal infection: pneumonitis, sinusitis, septicemia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and meningitis. Group C streptococci are described in terms of their biochemical properties, the infections they cause in animals, and their tendency to produce disease in humans. With increasingly frequent serologic grouping of non-group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, recognition of the role of specific non-group A streptococci is likely to increase. The antimicrobial agent of choice for infections due to group C streptococci is penicillin G. The minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the organism should be determined since penicillin tolerance may occur and may be responsible for the slow response to penicillin therapy in some cases.\r"

First described in 1912, A. actinomycetemcomitans has been recognized since 1962 as capable of causing serious infections in humans. Such infections include periodontal infection, soft tissue abscess (often in association with Actinomyces species), and systemic infection, most commonly endocarditis. Fifteen cases and a review of the English-language literature are presented to define the epidemiology and clinical features of infection due to A. actinomycetemcomitans. Therapy for infection due to A. actinomycetemcomitans has most commonly involved ampicillin or penicillin, often in conjunction with an aminoglycoside. However, resistance to penicillin or ampicillin is common. Antimicrobial agents with a high degree of in vitro activity included cefazolin, cefotaxime, cetriaxone, aminoglycosides, and chloramphenicol. Therapy should be guided by clinical response and in vitro susceptibility testing.\r"

Reports in the literature and hospital records were reviewed to determine the activity of EBV in the elderly. Seroepidemiologic surveys demonstrated that 90%-97% of adults more than 60 years old were seropositive for EBV. Geometric mean antibody titers and the percentage of individuals with high antibody titers to EBV increased with age--changes that were not associated with clinical illness. Only 29 cases of infectious mononucleosis have been reported in adults more than 60 years old. The elderly with infectious mononucleosis had significantly fewer occurrences of pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly when compared with young adults. The cases of two patients with illnesses that did not meet full criteria for infectious mononucleosis but may still have represented clinical manifestations of EBV infection are presented. Other EBV-associated diseases reported in the elderly include nasopharyngeal carcinoma and possibly B cell lymphoproliferative disease but not a chronic mononucleosis-like syndrome.\r"

Designed proteins provide simple model systems for understanding protein structure and function.\r"

In the presence of adenosine triphosphate, the NtrC protein catalyzes isomerization of closed recognition complexes between sigma 54-holoenzyme and the glnA promoter to open complexes in which DNA in the region of the transcription start site is locally denatured. NtrC is not required subsequently for maintenance of open complexes or initiation of transcription.\r"

Expression of both H- and N-ras oncogenes led to malignant transformation of these cells, as shown by clonogenicity in semisolid media and tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice. In addition, terminal differentiation into plasma cells was detectable as specific changes in morphology, immunoglobulin secretion, and cell surface antigen expression. This combined effect, promoting growth and differentiation in human lymphoblasts, represents a novel biological action of ras oncogenes and has implications for the pathogenesis of terminally differentiated B-lymphoid malignancies such as multiple myeloma.\r"

From August 1986 to July 1987, 62 patients with clinical signs of acute appendicitis received US examinations after initial clinical evaluations. According to clinical pictures, they were classified into two groups: group I, clinically typical (Alvarado's score greater than or equal to 7) and group II, clinically dubious (Alvarado's score less than or equal to 6) cases. All group I patients (n = 34) had surgery. Group II patients (n = 28) received close in-hospital observation on an every 4-hour basis for less than 24 hours. However, surgery was performed if Alvarado's score increased up to or above 7 or surgical indications became evident during observation. The pathologic reports and operative findings were retrospectively correlated with the US diagnosis. For group I patients, clinical examination without knowledge of US findings was correct in 30 (88.9%) cases, 26 (86.7%) of which were detected by US. Four (50%) of eight patients with negative US findings had acute appendicitis. In group II, 12 of 15 patients who had surgery had acute appendicitis, and 10 (83.3%) were detected by US. Two (11%) of 18 patients with negative US findings were finally proved to have acute appendicitis. The average duration from initial clinical examination to surgical decision fpr patients with acute appendicitis was 6.8 hours. There were no false-positives in either group. For patients with typical clinical presentation, US is not superior to clinical examination, and surgery is recommended even if US findings are negative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was no significant difference, however, in the total consumption of papaveretum. Both groups experienced similar degrees of pain, and there were no differences in postoperative pulmonary function. We conclude that although single intercostal blockade is an effective analgesic, it does not improve pain relief and does not improve pulmonary function after cholecystectomy when compared with a regimen of on-demand, intramuscularly administered papaveretum.\r"

The results of these studies were correlated with operative findings. One study involved the use of EOE-13, an intravenously administered lipid contrast agent that enhances liver parenchyma on computed tomography (CT) scans (EOE-CT). Another study, arterial portography (AP-CT), was performed with injection of a water-soluble contrast agent into the superior mesenteric artery during CT scanning. Delayed CT scanning (DS-CT) was completed 4 hours after AP-CT. In addition, T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (T1-MRI, T2-MRI) scans were done. All patients subsequently underwent laparotomy with identification of 78 lesions. A lesion-by-lesion analysis revealed that the sensitivity of EOE-CT (83%), AP-CT (78%), DS-CT (82%), and T1-MRI (84%) was comparable. T2-MRI had a significantly lower sensitivity (64%) compared with EOE-CT, DS-CT, and T1-MRI. The false-positive rate for AP-CT was 31%, which was significantly higher than that of all other studies. The T1-MRI examination had the lowest false-positive rate and proved to be the best hepatic imaging study in the detection of colorectal metastases. EOE-CT and DS-CT were comparable, whereas AP-CT and T2-MRI proved to be inferior tests.\r"

Prosthetic surgery for treatment of impotence was born from the initial experience with the use of the \"artificial os penis\" (rib cartilage) in post-traumatic reconstruction in 1936. Slow progress was made with the use of extracavernosal acrylic stents, followed by intracavernosal polypropylene rods, and finally the silicone prosthesis over the next 20 years. The introduction in 1973 of the inert silicone semirigid prosthesis and inflatable prosthesis met with great successes. Most recently (1985), there has been development of self-contained prostheses that are technically more simple to insert. Today, much more is known about specific organic causes of impotence that are amenable to many successful nonprosthetic alternative therapies, adding more stimuli to continued innovations in prosthetic surgery for erectile dysfunction.\r"

The genitourinary tracts of male and female NZW rabbits were removed and sequentially treated with mouse anti-GP1 sera, biotin-labelled anti-mouse IgG, and an avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex. The results demonstrated that an antigenically similar (or identical) glycoprotein covers the distal renal tubules and urothelium of the renal pelvis, ureters, bladder, and urethra, suggesting that it may function as an antibacterial defense mechanism throughout the urinary tract.\r"

When OCs are prescribed for only those women for whom they are appropriate, using the lowest dosage of estrogenic and progestogenic agents necessary to control fertility and prevent irregular bleeding, then morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular events can be avoided while allowing the largest number of women to benefit from their protection from neoplasia, infection, and benign breast disease.\r"

The endocrine syndromes, where they are understood, appear to be caused by increased production by the cancer of protein hormones, protein hormone precursors, or protein hormone-like substances. These proteins are commonly produced also by nonneoplastic, nonendocrine cells, and presumably represent paracrine or autocrine substances. Many of the neurologic syndromes, and possibly a wide range of other paraneoplastic syndromes, appear to be caused by tumor immunogen stimulation of antibodies that cross-react not only with the specific tumor antigen but also with antigens from host tissues. Antibody-mediated cell injury leads to the specific symptoms, determined by the tissue injured. Some of the hematologic paraneoplastic syndromes (e.g., aplastic anemia, red cell aplasia) may also be produced by immune mechanisms. Finally, at least one syndrome, multifocal leukoencephalopathy, is caused by a viral infection. Presumably the host with cancer is more susceptible to such infections. The pathogenesis of many syndromes caused by cancers remains unclear. The amino acid structure of the hormones produced by cancers has not been determined for any of the syndromes. The function of these protein hormones produced by normal, nonendocrine tissues is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Significant advances have been made in our understanding of the role of the vascular endothelium in preventing thrombosis and in decreasing vascular spasm. The endothelium provides a surface receptor, thrombomodulin, that binds thrombin. In this form, thrombin loses its ability to clot fibrinogen or to aggregate platelets, but is able to activate protein C. In its activated state, protein C is able to act as an inhibitor of coagulation by virtue of its proteolytic destruction of Factors Va and VIIIa. Congenital deficiency of protein C is associated with early and recurrent thrombosis. The discovery that the endothelium is responsible for the production of a short-acting inhibitor of smooth-muscle contraction (EDRF) was a remarkable advance. One of the EDRF substances has been demonstrated to be NO, which has inhibitory effects on both smooth muscle and blood platelets. Activity of EDRF appears to be diminished or lost as a consequence of atherosclerosis, and stimuli that cause vasodilation via the EDRF pathway in normal vessels cause vasoconstriction in atherosclerotic arteries. Regression of atherosclerosis in experimental animals appears to be associated with restoration of EDRF activity.\r"

  ".W": "After more than two centuries of administration of digitalis glycosides to patients with cardiac disease, empirical observation and tradition remain the basis for much of the clinical application of these drugs. Many questions remain, and the role of digitalis in the management of congestive heart failure and cardiac rhythm disturbances is changing with improvement in our understanding of the pathophysiology of these conditions and the availability of newer effective agents that may have less potential to cause life-threatening toxicity. Nevertheless, digitalis glycoside therapy is a familiar therapeutic intervention for the majority of physicians and remains appropriate in carefully selected patients. The development of digoxin-specific Fab fragments has led to improvement in treatment of advanced and refractory digitalis toxicity and opens up the possibility of improvement in diagnosis of less clinically obvious cases of digitalis intoxication. The role of digitalis glycosides in the management of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and congestive heart failure in the presence of sinus rhythm should now be revised. In each of these clinical circumstances, alternative drugs or other modes of therapy have been developed that reduce the dependence of clinicians on digitalis as the sole or primary approach to management. In the immediate management of paroxysmal reentrant supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, verapamil has largely replaced digoxin as the drug of choice, although digoxin has an ancillary role, especially in patients with impaired ventricular function. In the management of patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response, verapamil or diltiazem and beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs will effectively slow the ventricular response, thus reducing the likelihood of approaching the threshold of digitalis toxicity to achieve adequate rate control. In the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure and normal sinus rhythm, one must now recognize a subset of patients with diastolic rather than systolic dysfunction who are best treated by correcting underlying causes of left ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia rather than inotropic support with cardiac glycosides. Symptomatic patients with dilated ventricles and impaired contractile function should undergo correction of abnormalities of preload with vasodilators acting on the venous bed as well as diuretics, and reduction of elevated afterload with vasodilators that reduce arteriolar resistance and thus improve ventricular emptying.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Eight radiologists reviewed 50 computed and 50 screen-film chest radiographs from 25 patients with pneumothoraces and 25 patients with other (or no) abnormalities. Four of the readers who best detected pneumothoraces on screen-film examinations performed worse when interpreting computed radiographic studies; the other four readers detected pneumothoraces similarly with both techniques.

The hepatic lymphomas were characterized by multiple low-density areas on CT scans and hypoechoic areas on sonograms. In three of the four patients, the lesions regressed after the cyclosporine dosage was reduced. We conclude that in cyclosporine-treated organ transplant recipients, hepatic lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hepatic lesions with or without lymphadenopathy when multiple low-density lesions are shown by CT and hypoechoic lesions are shown by sonography.\r"

The patients were divided into two groups: those with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (aorta greater than 3 cm in transverse diameter) (n = 96) and those whose aorta measured less than 3 cm in transverse diameter (n = 538), who served as control subjects. Cholelithiasis was found in 50% of patients with and 26% of patients without aneurysm (p less than .0001). A stepwise logistic regression analysis found age alone to be predictive of cholelithiasis (p = .030). However, age was not predictive of cholelithiasis when included with abdominal aortic aneurysm in a multivariate model. Diabetes mellitus and gender were not predictive of cholelithiasis. We found cholelithiasis in approximately half of the patients who had abdominal aortic aneurysms. This is almost double the prevalence in the general elderly population.

The sonographic appearance of the testis was unchanged after vasectomy. However, in 14 men (45%), there were persistent changes in the epididymis. These consisted of enlargement (14 patients), development of cysts (11 patients), and an inhomogeneous echo pattern (five patients). The presence of these sonographic changes was unrelated to symptoms. The history of vasectomy in men referred for scrotal sonography should be noted so that the altered sonographic appearance of the epididymis may be interpreted properly.\r"

  ".U": "89132211\r", 
  ".W": "Recent reports have suggested the value of duplex Doppler sonography in the assessment of renal transplant function. Accurate diagnosis of acute rejection and its distinction from acute tubular necrosis and cyclosporine A toxicity have been claimed. We undertook a combined retrospective and prospective analysis of duplex Doppler examinations performed over a 2-year period to assess the value of such studies in evaluating renal allograft dysfunction. Seventy-seven sonographic examinations were performed on 77 renal transplants. A mean resistive index was calculated from Doppler measurements within main, segmental, and interlobar renal arteries by using the following ratio. peak systolic blood-flow velocity--minimum end-diastolic blood-flow velocity/peak systolic blood-flow velocity Forty-eight Doppler results were correlated with transplant biopsies and 29 with clinical course. Twenty-three episodes of acute allograft rejection were confirmed. When a resistive index of greater than or equal to 0.9 was used to indicate acute rejection, sonography had a sensitivity of only 9% and a specificity of 91% for this diagnosis. In one of eight cases of cyclosporine A toxicity and in three of six examples of acute tubular necrosis, the resistive index was greater than 0.9. In all six instances of chronic rejection, the resistive index was less than 0.84. None of eight patients with evidence of infection had a resistive index greater than 0.9. The resistive index range of 12 normally functioning allografts was 0.57-0.69. Correlation between the resistive index and the severity of arterial and arteriolar changes on biopsy was poor. An increased resistive index of renal transplant blood flow, as measured by duplex Doppler sonography, usually signals pathologic changes in an allograft. However, our data indicate that this test is not as sensitive or specific in identifying the cause of transplant dysfunction as has been suggested previously.\r"

The upper moiety did not function and, except for the ureterocele, the indirect urographic and direct sonographic signs of duplication were absent or subtle. We call this entity ureterocele disproportion. Seven patients presented with urinary infection and one was found to have hydronephrosis of a dilated lower moiety in utero. Five had ipsilateral lower-pole reflux, which ranged in degree from 3 to 5 (on a scale of 1-5). Two had bilateral duplication; one of these had a typical contralateral ectopic ureterocele. The diagnosis of ureterocele disproportion was strongly suggested by urography and sonography and was confirmed at cystoscopy by direct puncture of the ureterocele and opacification of the upper moiety. All had surgery. The approach varied and depended on the status of the lower moiety and the contralateral kidney. One had incision of the ureterocele only. Five with lower-pole reflux had excision of the ureterocele and ipsilateral common-sheath reimplantation.\r"

Sonography showed that 73% of patients with presumed transient synovitis had no effusion 2 weeks after diagnosis. Patients with hip disorders other than transient synovitis had persistent effusion for more than 2 weeks; however, that was also observed in 27% of patients with presumed transient synovitis. Sonography was more sensitive than plain films for detecting hip effusion. However, sonographic detection of effusion changed the therapeutic approach in only six patients.\r"

Two of the pseudocysts were drained via a transgastric approach, the other five via direct transcutaneous access to the pseudocyst. The catheters were in place an average of 25 days (range, 8-66). There were no serious complications. Six patients became asymptomatic with return of the serum amylase to normal and resolution of the pseudocyst on follow-up sonograms. One patient, in whom the catheter became dislodged after 2 weeks, became asymptomatic, but he had a residual 2-cm pancreatic pseudocyst that resolved over the next 6 weeks. Our experience suggests that percutaneous drainage is a safe and effective method of treatment for traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children.\r"

Twenty-eight patients (nine with Brescia-Cimino fistulas and 19 with synthetic grafts) were imaged with digital subtraction angiography and color Doppler sonography. The examinations were interpreted independently and then interpreted together to determine the accuracy of the two methods. With angiography as the gold standard, color Doppler sonography correctly identified 20 of 23 stenosed vessels, three of four occluded vessels, four of four thrombosed vessels, and 18 of 19 pseudoaneurysms. Overall, color Doppler sonography correctly identified all lesions that were seen angiographically in 16 of 19 patients with synthetic grafts and in four of nine patients with Brescia-Cimino fistulas. Five asymptomatic arterial steals were detected sonographically. One of these was identified with angiography. Color Doppler sonography is an adequate means of imaging suspected complications of hemodialysis vascular access, and it should be used in selected patients. However, digital subtraction angiography is more sensitive and should be the initial imaging technique for most of these patients.\r"

The subjects of this study were 58 patients who underwent programmed stimulation and did not have inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) with single or double extrastimuli at two basic drive cycle lengths and at two right ventricular sites; 17 patients had a history of uniform VT unrelated to exercise, and 41 had no history of documented or suspected VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Programmed stimulation was performed with triple extrastimuli at both right ventricular sites. Isoproterenol was infused as a dose titrated to increase the sinus rate by 25% or to a rate of 100 beats/min, whichever was greater, and stimulation then was repeated with single and double extrastimuli. Among the 17 patients with a history of uniform VT, the clinical VT was induced by three extrastimuli in five patients (29%) and by two extrastimuli during isoproterenol infusion in six patients (35%, p greater than 0.05). Among the total study population of 58 patients, nonclinical multiform VT or VF was induced by three extrastimuli in 29 patients (50%), and by two extrastimuli during isoproterenol infusion in 15 patients (26%, p less than 0.05). Therefore stimulation with two extrastimuli during isoproterenol infusion has the same probability of inducing a clinical form of VT as does stimulation with extrastimuli, but the former has a significantly lower probability of inducing nonclinical multiform VT and VF.\r"

Thirteen patients had sustained orthodromic supraventricular tachycardia induced during baseline study, and two patients needed isoproterenol to render it sustained. In all except one patient, propafenone, 2 mg/kg given intravenously over a 10-minute period, was successful in converting the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation was inducible in 10 patients before propafenone, but was no longer inducible in seven of these patients after the drug. The HV interval (23 +/- 20 to 41 +/- 25 msec) and the anterograde (310 +/- 96 to 509 +/- 145 msec) and retrograde (256 +/- 30 to 334 +/- 105 msec) effective refractory periods of the bypass tract were all significantly prolonged after the drug. The pacing cycle length that produced conduction block over the bypass tract anterogradely (319 +/- 126 to 446 +/- 150 msec) and retrogradely (272 +/- 25 to 360 +/- 97 msec) was also increased. During orthodromic tachycardia, propafenone increased conduction time in both the anterograde and retrograde limbs of the tachycardia. Tachycardia terminated in the retrograde limb in 64% of the patients. We conclude that propafenone is very effective in terminating orthodromic tachycardia when given intravenously and that it should be considered in patients initially seen with atrial fibrillation and short refractory periods.\r"

To fill this gap, the present review considers the available data concerning the embryogenesis of the coronary arteries and proposes a new definition of normality that refers to essential anatomic features. The concepts of normal variant versus anomaly are introduced, based on a statistical definition of the normal range (99% of the presentations observed in a normal, unselected population). Coronary anomalies are defined as those patterns found in less than 1% of the cases. The wide spectrum of coronary abnormalities is then organized according to a comprehensive classification scheme. For clinical purposes the conceptual difference between anatomic and pathophysiologic anomalies is stressed. The current paucity of experimental studies concerning normal and abnormal embryogenesis of the coronary arteries is found to be the major limitation to an understanding of this subject.\r"

The widespread use of intravenous thrombolytic therapy during the early hours of myocardial infarction has resulted in a decreasing incidence of shock with first myocardial infarctions. Three mechanisms bring about cardiogenic shock: (1) extensive aggregate systolic left ventricular dysfunction, (2) extensive right ventricular infarction, and (3) mechanical defects of the left and/or right ventricles attendant to ischemic dysfunction or rupture. To permit survival in cardiogenic shock, even with maximally aggressive therapy, diagnostic evaluation must be carried out concurrently with clinical stabilization of the patient. IABC is the mainstay for supporting the patient in shock during further efforts at diagnosis and definitive therapy. Definitive therapy for cardiogenic shock may include percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, emergent bypass surgery, or repair of a mechanical defect. This report details the current status of knowledge with respect to pathogenesis, recognition, and definitive treatment of myocardial infarction shock.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac transplantation can only be performed in a few patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF), due to the shortage of donor hearts. The efficacy of current medical therapy tailored for severe CHF, which has not previously been determined for transplant candidates, is of particular importance in patients considered for urgent cardiac transplantation. In this study, 50 consecutive in-patients transferred from other hospitals for urgent transplantation underwent intensive afterload reduction therapy, initially with intravenous and subsequently with oral vasodilators and diuretics tailored to hemodynamic goals. Oral regimens allowed hospital discharge without surgery for 40 of 50 patients. Nineteen of these patients had arrived on inotropic infusions and 32 had received oral vasodilators in the previous month. Cardiac index increased from 1.9 +/- 0.6 to 2.8 +/- 0.7 liters/min/m2, while pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 30 +/- 8 to 15 +/- 4 mm Hg and systemic vascular resistance decreased from 1,800 +/- 800 to 1,100 +/- 200 dynes-s-cm-5. Despite poor initial hemodynamics, ejection fraction 16 +/- 4%, serum sodium 131 +/- 6 mEq/liter, and apparent failure of previous medical therapy, actuarial survival for 24 discharged patients receiving sustained medical therapy alone was 67% at 1 year, with 67% of survivors employed full- or part-time, and 14 of 16 (88%) discharged transplant candidates survived until transplantation. By decreasing the need for transplantation to be performed urgently, increased emphasis on the design of medical therapy may allow more effective distribution of limited donor hearts.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnostic value of hepatic venous flow patterns was evaluated for constrictive pericarditis by pulsed Doppler. A characteristic flow pattern was assumed to be associated with the well-known atrial pressure curve. Thirteen patients with constrictive pericarditis were compared to 13 control subjects and to 25 patients with right ventricular pressure overload including 13 patients with tricuspid regurgitation. The characteristic finding in constrictive pericarditis was a W-wave pattern of flow velocities in the dilated hepatic veins, with abrupt reversal of flow late in systole and diastole before the A wave (100% specificity, 68% sensitivity). This depends, however, on the absence of tricuspid regurgitation (for its systolic component) or fast sinus rhythm (for its diastolic component). Additional diagnostic markers were systolic deceleration time of forward flow (40 to 130 ms) and systolic integral of flow velocities (4.3 to -4.0 cm) (sensitivity and specificity greater than or equal to 92%). In the presence of tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic deceleration time less than 150 ms and diastolic integral of flow velocities less than 6 cm were useful diagnostic signs. If combined, these criteria had 100% sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis. Thus, pulsed Doppler assessment of flow velocities in the hepatic vein facilitates the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis in clinical routine, using an auxiliary site with unlimited diagnostic access to the characteristic flow velocity pattern, which reflects right atrial pressure curve and filling abnormalities.\r"

In vitro testing was performed on Fe compounds with both solubility and dialysis in a simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion system. Two depletion-repletion techniques, hemoglobin-regeneration efficiency (HRE) and an official method of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC), were examined. AOAC relative biological values (RBV) of electrolytic Fe were 0.66 and 0.78 and of FePO4 were 0.25 and 0.34. HRE values were 0.78 and 0.58 for electrolytic Fe and FePO4, respectively. When compared with FeSO4 in a radiolabeled farina-based meal fed to humans, the RBV of FePO4 was 0.25 and electrolytic Fe 0.75. Results obtained with the AOAC method serve as the most reliable prediction of Fe bioavailability in the human although in vitro dialysis is a promising screening technique.\r"

Each starch was fed to subjects for 5 wk in a crossover design. No significant differences were observed in glucose or insulin levels when a glucose tolerance was given after 4 wk on each starch. However, glucose and insulin responses were significantly lower when a meal containing amylose compared with amylopectin was consumed after 5 wk on each starch. Summation of 0.5 through 2-h levels of insulin but not glucose were significantly lower after amylose compared with levels after amylopectin. Mean fasting triglyceride and cholesterol levels were significantly lower during the period when amylose was consumed. Long-term intake of dietary amylose may be valuable in decreasing insulin response while maintaining proper control of glucose tolerance and low levels of blood lipids.\r"

This entity can be misdiagnosed as Hodgkin's disease or a reactive process such as nonnecrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis or it can present a problem in lymphoma classification. Fine-needle aspirates from 13 patients with histologically proven PTCL were evaluated by cytology, immunochemistry, and flow cytometry. Of the 13 patients with PTCL, initial cytologic diagnoses were atypical lymphocytic infiltrate (2), mixed-cell lymphoma (6), mixed-cell lymphoma with associated histiocytes (2), large cell lymphoma (2), and small cell lymphoma (1). Surface marker studies were performed on cytospin preparations. Antibodies against cytotoxic-suppressor (Leu-2a) and helper-inducer (Leu-3a,b) antigens were used in 11 cases. Ten lymphomas demonstrated helper phenotype and one showed phenotypic heterogeneity in two different sites. The most prominent cytologic features of PTCL were a variable combination of small, intermediate, and large lymphoid cells with irregular nuclei, presence of epithelioid histiocytes, and atypical mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry studies showed a diploid stem line with intermediate proliferative activity (mean S-phase of 6.7%) in most cases, despite the clinical aggressiveness of this neoplasm.\r"

For beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG), the results with the immunoperoxidase technique were inferior to those of the conventional technique, and with the immunogold silver technique an enhancement of labeling results was achieved. Immunogold silver staining for beta-HCG on paraffin sections can be performed with the use of microwave irradiation within one hour.\r"

Immunohistochemical demonstration of TCCs was carried out on ethanol-fixed paraffin-embedded renal biopsy specimens by indirect immunoperoxidase technique. In glomerular diseases that are thought to be immune-complex glomerulonephritis (IC-GN), such as IgA-nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), TCCs were demonstrated in a pattern similar to that of immunoglobulins and C3, indicating that TCCs were induced by immune complexes. The intensity of TCC deposition was correlated with the morphologic destruction of glomeruli or serum creatinine levels in IgA-nephropathy, with urine protein in membranous nephropathy, and with serum C4 in SLE. TCC deposits without IC were also observed in tissue damages without disease specificity such as glomerular or vascular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial lesions. These findings suggested the existence of various roles of TCCs in renal injury, according to IC-mediated or non-IC-mediated mechanism acting in individual diseases.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of estrogen receptors (ERs) is essential for the treatment and prognosis of human breast cancer. The authors have undertaken a study of 225 primary breast cancers to compare the receptor values using immunohistochemistry and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) techniques. The results are compared with the biochemical assay with the use of the dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) method done on the same specimens. The overall concordance between ER-ICA and DCC was 77%. Ninety-seven percent concordance was observed for specimens with a positive ER-ICA score (greater than 70 and the DCC more than 10 fmol/mg protein). Ninety-two percent of tumors had negative results by ER-ICA when the DCC was less than 10 fmol/mg protein. When the ER-ICA score was plotted against the DCC or EIA value, a significant correlation was obtained with a P value of less than 0.001. The correlation between the ER-ICA score and the total ER content (cytosol and nuclear) assayed by EIA was similar to comparison with cytosol alone. The authors conclude that the ER-ICA can be useful in assessing ERs in breast especially in hypocellular or small tumors and in assessing the degree of heterogeneity in a given tumor. The immunohistochemical and biochemical assay methods are complementary and provide greatly needed information for the management of breast cancer.\r"

In 12 cases, samples obtained from surgical margins were examined by a rapid immunostaining method. In one case, conventional cytologic findings were equivocal, whereas by the rapid immunostaining method single cells were stained darkly, indicating malignancy.

Neither neoplasm expressed cytoplasmic immunoglobulin. DNA probe analysis using the Southern blot method and probes to the joining (J-H) region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and to the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin kappa and lambda light chain genes revealed different light and heavy chain gene rearrangements in the two neoplasms. These findings suggest that the large cell lymphoma arose from a different clone than the CLL and the development of large cell lymphoma may have represented a de novo neoplastic event in a predisposed person.\r"

This report represents a variable antigen excess problem with certain monoclonal antibodies while immunophenotyping a patient with leukemia by a whole blood flow cytometry method. The problem was resolved when both labeling methods used 1 X 10(6) cells per reaction tube. The results helped to encourage the vendor of the authors' commercial whole blood system to modify their procedure accordingly, but two other vendors have not yet made similar modifications. It suggests all commercial whole blood methods must be modified to accommodate for the leukocyte count and differential of the patient. Otherwise, the sensitivity of flow cytometers as used in traditional immunophenotyping protocols will not distinguish weakly stained cells from negative controls.\r"

Hemolysis secondary to the production of anti-A1 has been reported to be extremely rare. The English-language literature has six cases before 1979. During the 1980s, an additional seven cases were reported; six involved transplantation of a solid organ, and in each such case the donor was type O and the recipient was type A1 or A2. Recommendations regarding transfusion practice in such cases are made. An association among the transplantation of a type O organ to a type A recipient, the use of cyclosporine, and an apparent increase in the occurrence of clinically significant anti-A1 is suggested.\r"

Thirty-one patients received cefuroxime sodium (300 mg/kg per day in 3 doses) and dexamethasone phosphate (0.6 mg/kg per day in 4 doses for 4 days), and 29 received cefuroxime and placebo. The groups were comparable at the beginning of therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging performed between days 2 and 5 of therapy was used to assess brain water content indirectly. There were no differences between the 2 treatment groups with respect to the T1- or T2-weighted images. Fifty-two patients (88%) had normal magnetic resonance images; 5 patients had parietal or bifrontal extra-axial fluid collections, and 2 children had areas of abnormal signal intensity in the brain on T2-weighted images. Abnormal findings on magnetic resonance imaging did not alter clinical management, and there was no correlation between the results of magnetic resonance imaging and the outcome of meningitis. The number of patients in this study was too small to determine any statistically significant differences in rates of hearing impairment; however, the cerebrospinal fluid findings and clinical outcome in dexamethasone-treated patients further support the previously reported beneficial effect of corticosteroid treatment in patients with bacterial meningitis.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the relationship between maternal cigarette smoking and the risk of oral clefts in offspring, we examined data from the Atlanta Birth Defects Case-Control Study, which included 238 cases of cleft lip with or without cleft palate and 107 cases of cleft palate ascertained by the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program from 1968 through 1980. In all, 2809 infants who served as controls were frequency matched to cases by race, period of birth, and hospital of birth. Maternal periconceptional exposures to smoking were investigated through use of a structured questionnaire. Smoking exposure was defined as reported maternal smoking during the periconceptional period (from 3 months before conception to 3 months after pregnancy began). Offspring of smoking mothers were 1.6 and 2.0 times more likely than offspring of nonsmoking mothers to have isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate and cleft palate, respectively. On the other hand, offspring of smoking mothers were not at increased risk of having cleft palate or cleft lip with or without cleft palate that are associated with other defects. Adjustment for potential confounding variables did not alter these results. A relatively modest effect of smoking may be explained by the presence of underlying etiologic heterogeneity in oral clefts and differential susceptibility to smoking. Because of the inconsistencies in the literature on the relationship between smoking and oral clefts, these results suggest the need to refine oral clefts into more homogeneous subgroups in epidemiologic studies of these defects.\r"

  ".U": "89132480\r", 
  ".W": "Decreasing bilirubin formation is an important strategy for the prevention of neonatal jaundice. The stannic porphyrins, in particular tin protoporphyrin and tin mesoporphyrin, have been proposed for this purpose because these compounds competitively inhibit heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme-degrading pathway. However, these compounds are not only potent inhibitors of heme oxygenase but are also photosensitizers, which can generate cytotoxic oxygen species, such as singlet oxygen. Therapeutic regimens designed to avoid the phototoxicity caused by these and other metalloporphyrins have been suggested. An alternative approach would be the development of derivatives of tin protoporphyrin or other heme analogs that are less phototoxic and are stronger inhibitors of heme oxygenase. However, our understanding of the molecular basis of heme oxygenase inhibition is still limited. The response of heme oxygenase to specific inhibitors varies a great deal and depends on the organ and stage of development. This may be a result of the differing proportions of heme oxygenase isoenzymes in different organs. These questions and others need to be systematically answered so we may better understand and treat disturbances in heme homeostasis. In addition, administration of these compounds may have other metabolic consequences directly and indirectly related to their potent, long-lasting inhibition of heme oxygenase. The significance of such effects, whether transient or permanent, needs to be elucidated.\r"

Clinical investigations into the use of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) in the therapy of nutritional support for patients with HE have markedly increased. We have reviewed the rational basis for, and the controversies related to, the use of BCAA in the treatment of HE. We conclude that data on the use of BCAA in HE are controversial. There is marked variation in study design, and often, a lack of appropriate controls in patient numbers, as well as in consistent use of comparable measures of response. The ultimate role for BCAA in the treatment of HE is uncertain and will require additional objective information from well-designed and controlled clinical studies.\r"

Calcium carbonate was one of the first of these, as it occurred in relatively pure form in coral and limestone. Antacids were the keystone of medical management until the modern era of ulcer treatment. There has been a renewal of interest in antacids in recent years. Calcium as a component of the diet has come under scrutiny. Antacids have been found to be as effective in promoting healing of ulcer as H2 antagonists, sulcrafate, and colloidal bismuth. With regard to optimal dose in ulcer treatment, doses of antacids from 120 to 1008 mmol/day have been effective. A dose of 120 mmol/day given qid is effective. Low-dose antacids may increase mucosal resistance. The evidence for a specific gastric acid rebound with CaCO3 is based upon flawed assumptions and studies. Stimulation of gastric secretion occurs with all buffers, and this effect is compensated by the remaining buffer. When used properly, CaCO3 is an efficient, inexpensive, and safe antacid.\r"

Control of hypertension was similar with both antihypertensive regimens. Clearance of inulin and of paraaminohippuric acid increased during the first 3 months of captopril therapy and remained stable thereafter. Moreover, the decline in the reciprocal of serum creatinine over time observed during triple drug therapy was arrested during therapy with the ACE inhibitor. If the salutary effects of captopril are sustained, the results obtained in the current studies would suggest that control of hypertension by ACE inhibition may be effective in slowing progression of renal failure. Future studies to answer this important question are necessary.\r"

Less extensive renal ablation resulting from uninephrectomy also accelerates the progression of focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) induced by experimental diabetes, renal irradiation, aminonucleoside nephrosis, or aging. The consequence of the absence of one kidney in man are examined in three different clinical situations. Unilateral renal agenesis seems to predispose to the development of FGS, but most reports include isolated cases and the true incidence of FGS is not known. The solitary kidney following uninephrectomy for acquired unilateral disease undergoes a compensatory rise in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that remains stable for several decades. Finally, kidney donors followed for over 2 decades show unimpaired GFR, elevated at 70% to 80% of the normal (two-kidney) GFR. Some donors develop mild, nonprogressive proteinuria. Their incidence of hypertension matches that in the control population. Thus, hyperfiltration secondary to 50% reduction of renal mass in humans does not lead to loss of function of the remaining parenchyma.\r"

Following a two-week placebo period, patients were randomly assigned to receive either nifedipine or propranolol for a five-week treatment period, after which they crossed over to the alternative regimen. All 21 patients were men with chronic stable angina pectoris, 13 of whom had symptoms both at rest and on exertion. New York Heart Association functional class improved in patients taking either nifedipine or propranolol, and nitroglycerin consumption decreased with both treatments compared with placebo. Nifedipine significantly delayed the onset of chest pain and 1 mm of ST-segment depression during bicycle exercise; increases with propranolol were smaller and not statistically significant. Nine patients had a preferential clinical response to nifedipine compared with six patients to propranolol; this was unrelated to the presence or absence of pain at rest or to any baseline hemodynamic finding. Nifedipine and propranolol were equally effective in relieving exertional ischemia as shown by improvement in radionuclide ejection fraction at identical work loads. Exercise wall motion, assessed by a semiquantitative wall motion score, also improved with both drugs. Propranolol treatment decreased exercise cardiac output by 14 percent (p = 0.01) through its effect on heart rate. In contrast, nifedipine treatment had no effect on cardiac output. Thus, nifedipine is more effective on several measurements than propranolol when administered as single drug therapy in stable angina and has the advantage of preserving cardiac output during exercise.\r"

When myocardial ischemia is less severe but still prolonged, myocytes may remain viable but exhibit depressed contractile function, which may be a protective mechanism whereby these cells attempt to reduce their oxygen demand in the setting of reduced oxygen supply. The resultant chronic left ventricular dysfunction has been termed \"hibernating myocardium.\" Finally, myocardial ischemia may be reversed with coronary artery reperfusion resulting in salvage of the myocytes. However, the viable myocardium may demonstrate relatively prolonged but transient postischemic contractile dysfunction, the situation termed \"stunned myocardium.\" The concepts of stunned myocardium are reviewed as they apply to both coronary reperfusion during evolving acute myocardial infarction, as well as brief periods of ischemia that may occur during angina pectoris, or coronary vasospasm, or both. The concept of hibernating myocardium is reviewed as it applies to left ventricular function prior to and after coronary artery bypass surgery.\r"

Questions have arisen, however, about side-effect characteristics of these medications as clinical practice has led to utilization of higher doses of individual drugs than employed in large numbers of patients in early clinical trials as well as combinations with other antianginal agents including beta-blockers. A study was undertaken to examine the published literature regarding side effects associated with high-dose versus low-dose therapy with nifedipine and diltiazem and the use of these agents in combination with beta-blockers. This investigation demonstrated that utilization of high-dose diltiazem (more than 240 mg per day) as opposed to low-dose diltiazem (no more than 240 mg per day) was associated with an increased incidence of atrioventricular block, and increased peripheral vasodilatory effects. In contrast, the use of high-dose nifedipine (more than 60 mg per day) was not associated with atrioventricular block. At clinically high dosage levels, the incidence of peripheral edema was comparable for both nifedipine and diltiazem, although low-dose nifedipine resulted in a significantly greater incidence of edema compared with low-dose diltiazem. This analysis also demonstrated that bradyarrhythmia is associated with the combination of a beta-blocking agent and either low- or high-dose diltiazem, but not with nifedipine-beta-blocker combinations. Clinical experience suggests caution in the combined use of diltiazem and a beta-blocking agent because of the demonstrated additional adverse negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects. No additional adverse electrophysiologic effects have been noted for nifedipine-beta-blocker combinations. The literature analysis supports and mirrors widespread clinical experience obtained since nifedipine and diltiazem were introduced. It should be noted, though, that combination therapy with calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers should be done with caution, since there have been occasional reports of congestive heart failure or exacerbation of angina with this combination.\r"

Results from a 14-week, open-label, crossover multicenter trial completed by 91 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris demonstrate that patients treated with standard nifedipine capsules may be switched to equivalent total 24-hour doses of nifedipine GITS and achieve comparable or improved efficacy (due to improved compliance) with a more favorable side-effects profile. Furthermore, in a subset of 10 patients who underwent sequential exercise testing, exercise responses obtained throughout 12 weeks of treatment with nifedipine GITS were comparable to measurements obtained during treatment with nifedipine capsules and demonstrated that tolerance did not occur. These patients also experienced significantly fewer vasodilatory side effects during treatment with nifedipine GITS compared with nifedipine capsules. Thus, nifedipine GITS represents a sound pharmacologic approach to the management of ischemic disease; and with once-daily dosing and a favorable side-effect profile this agent affords the potential for better patient compliance and efficacy without concern about the development of tolerance.\r"

A monoclonal antibody (D9B1) to this glycoprotein has been derived and used to study tissue from 24 women with normal menstrual cycles. Results obtained with peroxidase immunohistochemistry suggest a highly significant variation in concentration of the glycoprotein, which is absent in the proliferative phase and present at maximal levels in the early secretory phase. The amount of antigen then diminishes slowly through the latter part of the secretory phase. The glycoprotein is produced in epithelial cells of glands and uterine lumen before being secreted across the apical cell surface. The secretory response is uniform in different areas of the tissue and within individual glands. However, considerable differences in secretory activity can be observed between adjacent glands in any part of the endometrium. Binding of the antibody is shown to be a new and novel parameter in characterization and standardization of the normal function of endometrium in response to ovarian hormones.\r"

  ".W": "Systolic/diastolic ratios of umbilical velocimetry obtained with either continuous-wave or pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography have been used to assess downstream placental vascular resistance and fetal well-being. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of systolic/diastolic ratios obtained by continuous-wave and pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography in the prediction of poor pregnancy outcome. Continuous-wave and pulsed-wave umbilical velocimetry was performed and systolic/diastolic ratios were measured in 200 high-risk pregnancies in the third trimester by use of Angioscan III and a General Electric RT 3600 scanner, respectively. A total of 165 study participants had normal systolic/diastolic ratios and 35 participants had elevated ratios (greater than 3.0) with both continuous-wave and pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography. Both methods identified 35 participants with abnormal ratios, and none of the women was misclassified by either method. The pulsed-wave and continuous-wave values for 35 participants with elevated ratios were 6.35 +/- 1.52 and 6.23 +/- 1.58, respectively; values for 165 participants with normal ratios were 1.95 +/- 0.40 and 1.96 +/- 0.41, respectively (not significantly different). Participants with elevated systolic/diastolic ratios within 7 days of delivery had significantly higher incidence of adverse pregnancy outcome as judged by small-for-gestational-age fetuses, presence of meconium at delivery, fetal distress in labor, cesarean sections and 5-minute Apgar scores less than 7. Fetuses with elevated ratios were delivered at an earlier gestational age (34 +/- 1.2 weeks), had lower birth weights (1422 +/- 151 gm), and spent more time in the neonatal intensive care unit (17.1 +/- 5.2 days), compared with fetuses with normal ratios (delivered at 38.5 weeks +/- 0.9 weeks, 3100 +/- 210 gm birth weights, and 2 +/- 0.2 days spent in neonatal intensive care units, respectively, p less than 0.05). We therefore conclude that continuous-wave and pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography produce similar results with regard to systolic/diastolic ratios in high-risk pregnancies, and either method appears to be a valuable adjunct in the surveillance of high-risk pregnancies.\r"

The study population consisted of 700 young normotensive primigravid women who were evaluated prospectively during pregnancy. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were carefully measured at each prenatal visit, and the mean arterial blood pressure in the second trimester was calculated for each measurement. An average greater than 90 mm Hg was considered abnormal. One hundred thirty-seven patients had preeclampsia, for an overall incidence of 19.6%. An average greater than 90 mm Hg had a sensitivity of 8% and a positive predictive value of 23%. The respective values for a threshold increase of greater than 15 mm Hg in diastolic pressure were 39% and 32%. For a threshold increase of greater than 30 mm Hg in systolic pressure, values were 22% and 33%. The negative predictive values for all tests studied ranged between 81% and 85%. Neither a mean arterial blood pressure in the second trimester of greater than 90 mm Hg nor a threshold increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure during the third trimester was significantly predictive of the development of preeclampsia.\r"

At our institution a sharp increase in the preterm delivery rate and a coincident decrease in the postterm delivery rate and the rate of intrauterine growth retardation were noted. Over a 3-year period, while the characteristics of the obstetric population changed only slightly, the gestational age distribution shifted, with a decrease in the mean gestational age of about 1 week and a risk in the reported preterm delivery rate from 12% to 17%. About 15% of this rise was explained by an increase in obstetric interventions, and another 15% can be explained by changes in the way physicians rounded off gestational age. The majority of the increase in the preterm delivery rate was related to changes involving ultrasonographic examinations. These changes included a greater percentage of the population examined, trends toward earlier examinations, a tendency for the physicians to use ultrasonography rather than the last menstrual period in choosing the final gestational age, the use of different standards, an increase in the number of structures measured, and the weight given to various structures for determination of gestational age. It is apparent that changes in use of ultrasonography had a profound effect on the reported gestational age distribution at our institution.\r"

Twenty-six animals were studied between 45 and 65 days' gestation. Prostacyclin (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 125 micrograms/kg/min) produced a dose-dependent decrease in arterial pressure (r = -0.915, p less than 0.0001) and uterine artery blood flow velocity, as measured by a miniaturized Doppler flow probe (r = -0.850, p = 0.0001), and an increase in heart rate (r = 0.745, p = 0.0335). Uterine resistance increased at each dose, with 125 micrograms/kg/min generating an increase greater than all others (p less than 0.02). The hypotensive effect of prostacyclin was blunted by indomethacin (p = 0.018). Rather than blunting the expected changes in the remaining parameters, pretreatment with indomethacin followed by prostacyclin significantly decreased uterine blood flow velocity further and increased uterine resistance. We conclude that prostacyclin infusion can have adverse effects on uterine blood flow and that these are altered by pretreatment with a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. Prostacyclin should be avoided in women with preeclampsia until further animal studies are available.\r"

We hypothesized that prostacyclin could reverse fetoplacental vasoconstriction produced by a thromboxane mimic (U-46619). Fetal regional blood flow was measured by the radioactive microsphere technique in six unanesthetized, near-term ovine fetuses. Measurements were made in the control period, again 20 minutes after a fetal infusion of U-46619 was begun, and finally 20 minutes after prostacyclin was added to the U-46619 infusion. Mean arterial pressure rose significantly in response to U-46619 (38 +/- 1 to 51 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and returned to baseline after prostacyclin (42 +/- 2 mm Hg). Renal resistance was increased from 0.16 +/- 0.01 to 0.22 +/- 0.01 mm Hg.ml-1.min.100 gm-1 (p less than 0.05) by U-46619 and decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) below baseline by addition of prostacyclin (0.10 +/- 0.02 mm Hg.ml-1.min.100 gm-1). Placental resistance also increased significantly (p less than 0.03) in response to U-46619 (from 0.15 +/- 0.01 to 0.21 +/- 0.01 mm Hg.ml-1.min.kg-1 fetal weight) but was further increased to 0.29 +/- 0.03 mm Hg.ml-1.min.kg-1 fetal weight by the addition of prostacyclin. Umbilical placental blood flow decreased significantly (p less than 0.03) when prostacyclin was added to U-46619 (315 +/- 40 to 195 +/- 30 ml.min-1.kg-1 fetal weight). Whereas U-46619 had no effect on fetal arterial blood gases, the addition of prostacyclin resulted in significant fetal acidosis (p less than 0.03). We conclude that thromboxane mimic causes fetal hypertension and renal and placental vasoconstriction. Prostacyclin reverses hypertension and renal vasoconstriction but, unexpectedly, worsens fetal placental vasoconstriction produced by thromboxane. It is likely that the observed fetal acidosis is a result of compromised placental function.\r"

Amyloid deposits were found mainly in the cerebral cortex in nondemented controls, while in AD they were distributed widely in the regions that were not affected in nondemented controls. The positivity of amyloid deposits in AD was 100% in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, caudate nucleus, claustrum, hypothalamus, nucleus basalis of Meynert, and cerebellar cortex. Putamen and brain-stem nuclei were affected frequently, and the spinal cord, dentate nucleus, and globus pallidus were sometimes (less than 50%) affected. This result provides an evidence that Alzheimer's disease is a beta-protein amyloidosis of the central nervous system. An assessment of the distribution of amyloid deposits should prove to be useful for the histopathologic diagnosis of AD.\r"

The authors have performed immunoperoxidase on non-Hodgkin's lymphomas using Ki-67 antibody in order to correlate proliferation rates with tumor grade and type, and compare Ki-67 staining with S-phase content as determined by flow cytometry. Ki-67 staining of 109 sections was quantitated using a digital image analysis system (CAS 100). There was a significant difference among mean overall Ki-67 staining values in Working Formulation low (13.7%), intermediate (42.6%), and high grade tumors (57.9%, P less than 0.00001). The level of significance improved when a revised grading system was formulated based on proliferative activity, with the inclusion of diffuse large cell lymphomas in the high grade category. Within nodular and a few diffuse lymphomas, there were well-defined proliferation centers in which Ki-67 staining showed no correlation with grade. Flow cytometric DNA determination was performed on 74 specimens, and there was a positive correlation between Ki-67 positivity and S phase content (r = 0.66). It is concluded that Ki-67 staining of tissue sections is an alternative to flow cytometric quantitation of cell cycle activity in lymphomas, and provides the advantage of revealing histologic patterns of proliferation. By including G1 phase cells, Ki-67 staining allows a more complete determination of total cell cycle activity in lymphomas.\r"

Using whole body irradiation to delay the inflammatory response and so retard particulate clearance, many more instilled silica particles reached the interstitial macrophages in the first 2 weeks than after silica alone. This was followed by greatly increased fibroblast proliferation and deposition of collagen in the irradiation plus silica group, which developed large interstitial granulomas at the sites of silica retention. Although alveolar macrophages containing silica were seen in both silica groups, more interstitial particles were observed after combined irradiation and silica, significantly more silica was recovered in a residue from the lungs at 16 weeks, and pulmonary fibrosis at 8-16 weeks was greater than in all other groups. The results indicate that increased fibroblast growth and collagen synthesis in vivo are associated with phagocytosis of silica by interstitial macrophages rather than by free alveolar macrophages. It is suggested that transfer of a macrophages-derived growth factor to fibroblasts is more efficient when it occurs within the pulmonary interstitium.\r"

A commercially available biotinylated DNA probe specific for the cytomegalovirus to develop a practical method for detection of nucleic acid sequences in plastic-embedded tissues was used.

The authors have prepared a membrane fraction of isolated human glomeruli, from which two proteins (apparent molecular weights 120 kd and 140 kd) bound to a fibronectin-column, and were selectively released by the synthetic peptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser. These molecules were labeled in immune overlays by an antibody raised against the FNR from human placenta that recognizes both the FNR-specific a-chain and the group-specific beta 1-integrin chain. In sections of normal human kidneys this antibody labeled predominately the mesangia and the peripheral capillary walls of glomeruli by an immunoperoxidase procedure. Quantitative immunoelectron microscopy, using an indirect immunogold procedure, revealed a preferential localization along the cell membranes of mesangial, epithelial, and endothelial cells that face the mesangial matrix or the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). In kidney biopsies from patients with various glomerular diseases (membranous and other forms of glomerulonephritis, minimal change disease) the distribution was similar to that in normal glomeruli. These findings indicate that a beta 1-integrin-related FNR is present in normal and diseased human glomeruli.\r"

Prepubescent schoolchildren with hemoglobin levels of 8-12 g/dl were randomly assigned to receive either 200 mg ferrous sulfate or a placebo twice daily for 16 weeks. Iron status and malarial infection were assessed at baseline, after 6 and 16 weeks of therapy, and 8 weeks after therapy was discontinued. Iron status was significantly improved by the treatment. The treatment did not significantly affect parasite rate, parasite density, or levels of anti-malarial IgG. No changes in spleen size were observed in either group. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the groups in reported episodes of suspected malaria during the therapy. These results suggest that, in malaria endemic areas, oral treatment for iron deficiency can be carried out in semi-immune or immune schoolchildren without adverse consequences.\r"

The assay system was based on the in vitro inhibition of schizont maturation. The parasites were generally sensitive to mefloquine (mean 50%-inhibitory concentrations = 9.98 nM) and highly resistant to chloroquine (IC50 = 313 nM). The mean in vitro activity of desethylamodiaquine (67.5 nM) was approximately 3.5 times lower than that of amodiaquine (18.2 nM). There was a significant rank-order correlation between the IC50S of desethylamodiaquine and chloroquine, but not between amodiaquine and chloroquine, which suggests that the apparent cross-resistance between chloroquine and amodiaquine observed in clinical studies may be more closely related to the cross-resistance between chloroquine and the metabolite rather than between chloroquine and the parent compound. Isolates with IC50 values of amodiaquine greater than 20 nM demonstrated a high degree of correlation with values of desethylamodiaquine; however, it was not possible to accurately predict the sensitivity to desethylamodiaquine of isolates which had IC50 values of amodiaquine of less than 20 nM.\r"

The epidemic strain of S. dysenteriae I was resistant to tetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but susceptible to ampicillin. Trimethoprim resistance was chromosomally encoded by type I dihydrofolate reductase. In Ubon Province, where 10,000 cases of dysentery were reported, there were 3-5 cases of dysentery per 1,000 residents during the peak months, with 2-5 hospitalizations per 100 cases of reported dysentery. There were 2 deaths among 101 hospitalized, culture-confirmed cases. The overall case-fatality rate among reported cases of dysentery in this province was 0.9%. In contrast to S. flexneri infections, which occurred predominantly among children less than 5 years old, S. dysenteriae I infections occurred in all age groups. The large number of susceptibles appeared to be important in allowing rapid spread of S. dysenteriae I. In 1 village, 46% of 434 villagers reported dysentery; S. dysenteriae I was isolated from 24 out of 81 (30%) individuals cultured. Based on the prevalence of IgG antibody to S. dysenteriae I lipopolysaccharide, it was estimated that 76% of the villagers had been infected.\r"

Serial quantitative blood cultures and quantitative whole organ cultures were obtained. One week after surgery, clearance of bacteremia was impaired in all of the animals. Clearance of intraperitoneally injected E. coli was less efficient in the duct ligation rats. Fourteen days postoperatively, clearance of bacteremia induced by intravenous or intraperitoneal injection had improved in the sham celiotomy rats but was still significantly impaired in the duct ligation rats. An increased number of viable E. coli were recovered from the lungs of duct ligation rats after intravenous administration. We found that rats with obstructive jaundice do not respond normally to a bacteremia challenge. This impairment in reticuloendothelial function can be noted as early as 1 week after common duct ligation.\r"

Charts, intraoperative anesthesia records, blood bank records, flow sheets, outpatient records, and autopsy reports were examined in 45 pediatric and 15 adult patients who underwent primary orthotopic liver transplantation. Analysis of the data can be summarized as follows: (1) Pediatric patients whose coagulation parameters could not be corrected prior to operation and who consequently required preoperative exchange transfusion had poorer outcomes than those not requiring an exchange to correct coagulation parameters. (2) The rapid infusion technique for massive blood transfusion resulted in significantly decreased blood loss and intraoperative blood product replacement. (3) Twenty-four hour postoperative factor V levels were good predictors of survival. Patients with poor factor V levels required rigorous replacement of coagulation factors. (4) Pediatric patients with uncorrectable coagulopathies requiring immediate postoperative exchange transfusion had extremely high mortality.\r"

The procedure reduced peak acid output in response to insulin stimulation by 71 percent. Acid production was not further decreased by extramural division of vagal fibers. It also decreased parietal cell sensitivity to pentagastrin stimulation and did not interfere with emptying of a liquid meal. We have concluded that transmural proximal gastric vagotomy is technically straightforward, reliably divides fundic vagal fibers, produces a significant reduction in acid production equivalent to that produced by standard operative techniques, and does not interfere with gastric emptying.\r"

Acute renal failure occurs in approximately 9 percent of patients requiring surgery for relief of obstructive jaundice, and contributes to eventual mortality in 76 percent of those who develop it. The overall mortality rate for patients undergoing surgery for obstructive jaundice is 16 percent. Despite advances in perioperative care, these figures have changed very little over the past 25 years. This article describes the clinical association between jaundice and renal failure and reviews the studies that have contributed to the delineation of the possible underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, as well as possible preventive measures which have been developed as a result of these investigations. With increased awareness of the potential risk of developing postoperative acute renal failure, the institution of prophylactic measures may result in an improvement in the mortality rate seen after surgery for obstructive jaundice.\r"

Numerous pharmacokinetic drug interactions of potential clinical significance exist because other drugs may induce or inhibit the metabolism of CyA. Case reports and studies demonstrate that rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine may induce the hepatic metabolism of CyA, causing decreased CyA concentrations. Graft rejection through inadequate immunosuppression may be associated with subtherapeutic or decreased CyA levels. Erythromycin, ketoconazole, calcium channel blockers, and sex hormones appear to inhibit CyA metabolism, causing increased CyA concentrations. Signs and symptoms of renal, hepatic, or neurotoxicity may be evident with increased or toxic CyA levels. Mutual inhibition of metabolism occurs between CyA and corticosteroids. Intravenous sulphadimidine and trimethoprim may cause decreased CyA concentrations by an unknown mechanism.\r"

By this densitometry, the volumes of vascular bed perfused by the left coronary artery could be estimated, and further, nontransmural myocardial infarction could be differentiated from transmural myocardial infarction through the profile of its density curve.

Myocardial infarct size (as percent of left ventricle, LV) was decreased from 44 +/- 3% in saline-treated control animals to 34 +/- 4% (P less than 0.05) in U-63,557A-treated animals and to 32 +/- 4% (P less than 0.05) in SQ-29,548 treated animals (U-63,557A-treated vs SQ-29,548-treated, P = NS). LV creatine kinase (CK) was 5.08 +/- 0.42 IU/mg protein in noninfarcted untreated rats and 1.79 +/- 0.21 IU/mg protein in saline-treated infarcted rats. LV CK was 2.86 +/- 0.40 IU/mg protein in U-63,557A-treated rats and 3.11 +/- 0.51 IU/mg protein in SQ-29,548-treated infarcted rats (both P less than 0.05 compared with saline-treated rats). The beneficial effects of U-63,557A and of SQ-29,548 were not accompanied by reduction in indices of myocardial oxygen demand (heart rate and arterial pressure). However, neutrophil accumulation in the infarcted myocardium was markedly decreased by U-63,557A and SQ-29,548 pretreatment. Myocardial myeloperoxidase activity, a specific marker of neutrophil infiltration, was also decreased (P less than 0.02) in U-63,557A- and SQ-29,548-treated animals (0.09 +/- 0.03 and 0.07 +/- 0.02 units/100 mg, respectively) compared with saline-treated infarcted rats (0.19 +/- 0.04 units/100 mg). In vitro incubation of U-63,557A and SQ-29,548 caused a significant and similar reduction in f-MLP-induced neutrophil chemotaxis, and U-63,557A increased prostacyclin formation in whole blood. These data suggest that reduction in the extent of myocardial injury by TXA2 synthetase or receptor inhibitors may, in part, relate to a decrease in neutrophil accumulation in the infarcted tissue. In spite of differences in mechanisms of action of U-63,557A and SQ-29,548, both agents exert a similar protective effect on the extent of myocardial injury following coronary ligation. Reduction in neutrophil accumulation in the infarcted zone, as well as in f-MLP-directed chemotaxis in vitro, suggests that TXA2 inhibition may modulate neutrophil migration.\r"

Many of these studies suffer from inadequate sample size or deficient study design. There is no evidence that any medication given by the prehospital care provider is beneficial or cannot safely be delayed until arrival at hospital. Multicenter trials must be designed and implemented if we are to provide the evidence necessary to evaluate our current practice.\r"

This case is a somewhat atypical presentation and reemphasizes several key points in the prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of malaria.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of EVL for treatment of active variceal hemorrhage. Twenty-three consecutive patients with actively bleeding esophageal varices had EVL with a flexible gastroscope. Treatment was measured by initial control of bleeding, incidence of early and late rebleeding, survival, complications, and size of varices at subsequent endoscopy. Repeat EVL was performed as needed for bleeding and at two week intervals until varices were grade I or eradicated. Follow up of survivors ranged from 90 to 400 days (mean 280). Bleeding varices were initially controlled in 22 (95.6%) patients. Nine (39.1%) died, five from hepatic failure with no recurrent bleeding, four from continued (1) or early recurrent (3) hemorrhage. All deaths occurred within 3 to 24 days (mean = 9.4) of initial treatment for active bleeding. Twelve of 14 surviving patients have achieved variceal eradication or reduction in size to grade I or less with a mean of 5.5 repeat EVL sessions (range, 0-10). One refused further treatment; one is lost to follow up. Excluding rebleeding, there were no treatment-related complications in 80 EVL sessions. Active variceal bleeding requiring endoscopic control is associated with substantial mortality, especially in higher risk patients. EVL is effective for initial and long term control of bleeding. EVL appears to be associated with a low incidence of non-bleeding complications.\r"

In the dog model, the videoendoscope was inserted per orum to visualize side-to-side (gastrojejunostomy) and end-to-end (jejunojejunostomy) anastomoses and to establish endoscopic criteria of normal anastomosis, verified by examination of the specimen. Technically faulty anastomoses were then constructed and inspected endoscopically to determine the signs of poor technique. In clinical application, the videoendoscope was used to inspect the anastomoses after low anterior resection, revision of gastric bypass, and choledochoduodenostomy. The laboratory results indicate that direct visualization of a defect in suture-line with the end-viewing endoscope is difficult, although indirect signs of trouble are helpful. Conversely, the appearance of a perfect anastomosis without any indirect signs of poor technique is accurate in the assurance of a trouble-free anastomosis. The best clinical use is in low anterior resection of the rectum and the worst is in choledochoduodenostomy. It is concluded that videoendoscopic inspection of anastomosis is only of limited help in determining the integrity of a difficult anastomosis, and much work is required to perfect both the instrument and technique before general use is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne spirochetal infection, characterized by erythema chronicum migrans and an acute systemic illness. The disease is endemic in many parts of the north-eastern United States. Without treatment, late rheumatic, neurologic, and cardiac complications frequently occur. We report four serologically confirmed cases of Lyme carditis in previously healthy young men (mean age, 45 years) from endemic areas. Each presented with severe symptomatic atrioventricular block, three with episodes of prolonged ventricular asystole. Two had permanent pacemakers implanted (one was later removed), and another, very nearly did, before diagnosis. All four patients were treated with antibiotics, and in each case their rhythm returned to sinus, though one patient has Wenckebach second degree block with atrial pacing at 120 beats/min 16 months later. Carditis occurs in 4% to 10% of cases of Lyme disease and usually begins 3 to 6 weeks after the initial illness. It manifests as a transient myocarditis with varying degrees of atrioventricular block. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical grounds and confirmed by serologic testing. Temporary cardiac pacing is frequently needed by patients who have severe heart block with hemodynamic instability. The evidence suggests that, in most cases, the block is at the level of the atrioventricular node. The block generally resolves completely with antibiotic treatment. Complete heart block rarely persists more than 1 week and the long-term prognosis appears to be excellent. Consideration and prompt recognition of this potentially lethal, but reversible, cause of heart block is crucial in order to avoid inappropriate permanent pacemaker implantation.\r"

DESIGN: Single arm nonrandomized dose escalation study. PATIENTS: Twenty-one patients with advanced malignancy who were not receiving concurrent myelosuppressive therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Subcutaneous administration of rhGM-CSF by once-daily injection to groups of two to four patients at doses of 0.3 to 30 micrograms/kg body weight.d for 10 consecutive days. Some patients received a second 10-day period of daily rhGM-CSF treatment after a 10-day nontreatment interval followed by alternate-day treatment. Clinical status and hematologic values were monitored frequently. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All doses of rhGM-CSF caused an immediate transient fall of 84% to 99% in circulating neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes. Continued daily dosing caused a leukocytosis of up to 10-fold with increases in numbers of circulating neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. There appeared to be a plateau in the increase in neutrophils in the dose range 3 to 15 micrograms/kg.d. Marrow aspirates showed increased proportions of promyelocytes and myelocytes. Alternate-day injection of 15 micrograms/kg maintained a leukocytosis. At doses up to 15 micrograms/kg.d, rhGM-CSF was well tolerated but adverse effects included bone pains, myalgias, rashes, and liver dysfunction. At doses exceeding 15 micrograms/kg.d, pericarditis was a dose-limiting toxicity. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was reactivated by rhGM-CSF in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterially synthesized rhGM-CSF induces a leukocytosis in the dose range of 3 to 15 micrograms/kg.d. These doses are appropriate for phase II studies.\r"

These issues include a lack of understanding of protective immunity to HIV and disease development, the absence of an adequate and convenient animal model for studying HIV infection, and difficulties in phase III evaluation of candidate vaccines. Because HIV can be transmitted as either a cell-free or cell-associated virus, a protective immune response against HIV infection will likely require both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. A neutralizing antibody against HIV and an antibody involved in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity have been shown in HIV-infected persons, but their precise relation to protection is unclear. Cytotoxic lymphocytes from HIV-infected persons have been shown to lyse target cells expressing HIV or its proteins. Cloned T cells have been developed that manifest HIV-specific, major histocompatibility-complex class I-restricted cytotoxic capabilities that are broadly specific. Thus far, all attempts to protect chimpanzees, currently the only suitable animal model, from HIV infection have failed. Ongoing vaccine studies in humans include phase I trials of recombinant proteins of the HIV envelope in uninfected persons as well as the administration of whole killed virus to persons already infected with HIV. Rapid progress is being made in the development of new animal models for HIV infection. The establishment of alternative animal models, both primate and small animal models, will greatly facilitate the development of a vaccine for HIV infection.\r"

The generation system was capable of producing highly stable HCHO vapor concentrations with fluctuations of HCHO concentrations of less than +/- 5%. The experimental design included pre-exposure methacholine challenge to determine if responses to HCHO were associated with pre-existing bronchial hyperreactivity. Significant changes in average pulmonary flow resistance (RL) were observed (compared to control RL values) at 2 (p less than 0.01), 5 (p less than 0.01), and 10 min (p less than 0.005) post-HCHO challenge. Pre-challenge RL values (mean +/- SEM) were 11.3 +/- 1.4 cm H2O.l/s, while at 2, 5, and 10 min after HCHO challenge, values were 16.1 +/- 2.1, 16.9 +/- 2.8 and 20.0 +/- 3.4 cm H2O.l/s, respectively. Methacholine challenge data suggest that reactions to HCHO tend to be greater in monkeys hyperreactive to methacholine, but the relationship does not reach statistical significance in this small series of animals. These data indicate that significant pulmonary function deficits occur immediately after challenge with 2.55 ppm HCHO vapor in monkeys.\r"

These individuals had no reason to misrepresent their current tobacco-smoking status. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values positive and negative of the cotinine levels in distinguishing self-reported current tobacco smokers from nonsmokers was high (88-100%) and essentially the same for both fluids. Agreement between self-report and cotinine levels was not influenced by the presence or absence of marijuana smoking. A good correlation was found between serum and salivary cotinine levels in self-reported tobacco smokers (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001). Mean average levels were 279 +/- 144 ( +/- standard deviation) ng/ml for serum and 360 +/- 195 ng/ml for saliva. In a separate group of seven tobacco smokers, cotinine levels in saliva were found to be essentially independent of salivary flow rate. An analogous relationship has been observed by others for various compounds that are filtered to saliva from the blood. This may explain the close relationship observed between serum and salivary cotinine levels, and the observation made by others that the half-life of salivary cotinine is similar to that of serum cotinine.\r"

  ".W": "Proximal gastric vagotomy is nearing its twentieth year in clinical use as an operation for peptic ulcer disease. No other acid-reducing operation has undergone as much scrutiny or study. At this time, the evidence of such studies and long-term follow-up strongly supports the use of proximal gastric vagotomy as the treatment of choice for chronic duodenal ulcer in patients who have failed medical therapy. Its application in treating the complications of peptic ulcer disease, which recently have come to represent an increasingly greater percentage of all operations done for peptic ulcer disease, is well-tested. However, initial series suggest that it should probably occupy a prominent role in treating some of these complications, particularly in selected patients, in the future. The operation has the well-documented ability to reduce gastric acid production, not inhibit gastric bicarbonate production, and also minimally inhibit gastric motility. The combination of these physiologic results after proximal gastric vagotomy, along with preservation of the normal antropyloroduodenal mechanism of gastrointestinal control, serve to allow patients with proximal gastric vagotomy the improved benefits of significantly fewer severe gastrointestinal side effects than are seen after other operations for peptic ulcer disease.\r"

One hundred sixty-nine patients remained for analysis, with 93 undergoing TG and 76 undergoing SG. Elective TG did not increase postoperative mortality (1.3%) compared with SG (3.2%). There was no difference in the 5-year survival rate (48%). Analysis of survival showed no difference in the two techniques when related to nodal involvement and serosal extension.

This study tests whether increasing the PG/Tx ratio by administration of vasodilating PGs protects the reperfused ischemic kidney. Anesthetized rats underwent right nephrectomy and 45 minutes of left renal pedicle clamping. Beginning 10 minutes before clamp release, animals were treated intravenously with the following: saline placebo (n = 10); the cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen (Ibu), 12.5 mg/Kg in a bolus (n = 8); a stable analogue of prostacyclin (PGI2), 500 ng/kg/minute for 2 hours (n = 9); PGE1, 400 ng/kg/minute for 2 hours (n = 8); the combination Ibu and PGI2 (n = 8) or PGE1 (n = 8). In saline treated ischemic controls, 5 minutes after reperfusion plasma, thromboxane (TxB2) and 6-keto-PGF1 levels were 2537 and 317 pg/ml, respectively--higher than the TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 levels of 750 and 80 pg/ml, respectively, in nephrectomized but nonischemic sham controls (n = 7) (p less than 0.05). In ischemic control animals at 24 hours, creatinine levels were 4.6 mg/dl, relative to 0.9 ml/dl in sham animals (p less than 0.05); the weight of the left (L) ischemic kidney relative to the right (R) normal kidney was 118%, compared with 99% in sham animals (p less than 0.05); and renal histology of ischemic control animals at 24 hours showed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) relative to normal findings in sham animals. Pretreatment with Ibu led to: TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 levels of 116 and 40 pg/ml, lower than those of sham animals (p less than 0.05); creatinine levels of 4.6 mg/dl, L/R renal weight of 119%; and ATN similar to that of ischemic controls. Treatment with a PGI2 analogue or PGE1 was not protective and led to increases in TxB2, 6-keto-PGF1, creatinine, L/R renal weight, and ATN similar to that of ischemic controls. The combination of Ibu and either PGI2 or PGE1 led to: reduced levels of TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 (p less than 0.05); attenuated increases in creatinine to 2.2 and 2.3 mg/dl, respectively (p less than 0.05); and limited ATN (p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the vasodilating PG protect the ischemic reperfused kidney only when Tx is inhibited.\r"

In order to evaluate the impact of this type of pulmonary support, a retrospective analysis of 50 neonates with posterolateral congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) who were symptomatic during the first hour of life and were treated between June 1974 and December 1987 was carried out. The patients were divided into two groups, those treated before June 1981 (16 patients) and those treated after June 1981 (34 patients). Overall survival improved from 50% (eight of 16 patients) during the pre-ECMO era to 76% (26 of 34 patients) during the post-ECMO period (p = 0.06). During the period after June 1981, 21 neonates were unresponsive to conventional therapy and were therefore considered for ECMO. Failure of conventional therapy was defined as acute clinical deterioration with an expected mortality of greater than 80% based on an objective formula previously reported. Six patients were excluded on the basis of specific contraindications to ECMO. Thirteen of 15 infants (87%) supported with ECMO survived. Three patients treated before 1981 met criteria for ECMO; all three died while receiving treatment using conventional therapy. These survival differences are significant (p less than 0.01). In addition, the survival of 87% for the infants treated with ECMO versus the expected mortality of greater than 80% for these same patients when treated with conventional therapy is highly significant (p less than 0.005). Based on this data, ECMO appears to be a successful, reliable, and safe method of respiratory support for selected, critically ill infants with CDH.\r"

All 22 studies had important methodological flaws that preclude valid conclusions about the value of screening preoperative spirometry. The available evidence indicates that spirometry's predictive value is unproved. Unanswered questions involve (1) the yield of spirometry, in addition to history and physical examination, in patients with clinically apparent lung disease; (2) spirometry's yield in detecting surgically important occult disease; and (3) its utility, or beneficial effect on patient outcome. Spirometry's full potential for risk assessment in the individual patient has not yet been realized.\r"

Biopsy specimens were obtained from both the center and the advancing edge of erythema. Only nine biopsy specimens (three central and six peripheral) (18%) of 50 yielded pathogens. Needle aspiration cultures were performed in seven cases: two yielded pathogens (28.5%). The density of microorganisms was low, ranging from less than 80 colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram of tissue to 1360 CFUs/g of tissue, except next to the edge of an ulcer (two cases), where densities reached 3.2 x 10(6) CFUs/g of tissue. Cutaneous cellulitis shows a discrepancy between the low density of microorganisms and the intensity of the inflammation. A factor other than infection must be implicated. This might be lymphatic failure, which is found in 72% of patients.\r"

The basal TSH level, determined with the sensitive assay, predicted the TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH); all patients whose basal TSH level was less than 0.35 mU/L had absent or subnormal responses, and all patients with TSH levels of 0.35 mU/L or greater had normal responses. In patients with normal TSH levels, the T4 level and FTI were superfluous (normal) or misleadingly high; conversely, 65% of patients with low TSH levels had normal T4 levels or FTIs, or both. An assay for TSH with sufficient sensitivity to discriminate between abnormally low values and the low range of normal can be used as the primary test for monitoring levothyroxine treatment. The T4 or FTI measurements are not needed if the TSH level is normal, but they should be done in patients with low TSH levels.\r"

While endocrine dysfunction has not been a prominent clinical feature of AIDS, all endocrine glands may be affected by the opportunistic infections and neoplasms or by agents used in their treatment. Adrenal cortical insufficiency related to cytomegalovirus and ketoconazole therapy, hypoglycemia related to pentamidine therapy, and hyponatremia secondary to diverse causes are the most serious endocrine abnormalities that commonly occur. As the numbers of patients with AIDS increase, the development of these and other endocrine complications will occur more often. Because the clinical manifestations of endocrine dysfunction may be nonspecific or subtle, they may be overlooked, particularly in the setting of chronically and severely ill patients. Recognition and prompt therapy for endocrine dysfunction is essential for optimal treatment of these patients.\r"

Penicillin is the treatment of choice for clostridial endocarditis, but metronidazole should be considered as an alternate therapy for treatment that fails.\r"

The second patient developed an irregular white patch just proximal to an old gastrojejunostomy anastomosis, which revealed numerous clusters of adenomatous tubules filled with cytoplasmic Paneth granules. The \"Paneth\" nature of the granules was supported by the morphological, histochemical, and ultrastructural findings.

In group 2, 23 patients with symptomatic renal disease presented with nephrotic range proteinuria (11), renal insufficiency (eight), and hypertension (four). A mesangiopathic glomerulonephritis was diagnosed in 16 cases, and in 11 was IgA predominant. Three cases of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis occurred in group 2. Five cases revealed focal glomerulosclerosis without immune deposits (three in group 1 and two in group 2). More than half (57%) of the patients undergoing biopsy were related. Cases of symptomatic nondiabetic renal disease showed a significant tendency to cluster among the members of four families, suggesting a hereditary influence in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated glomerulonephritis in the Zuni.\r"

Statistical analysis shows that glomerular deposits of IgG and C3, glomerular sclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, interstitial inflammation, and tubular atrophy are associated with renal insufficiency at the time of biopsy, and can be integrated into a pathologic index that has a high correlative value. Mesangiopathic glomerulonephritis is probably responsible for the high rates of non-diabetic end-stage renal disease seen in Navajo Indians.\r"

Subsequently, all had positive myelograms and positive disc protrusions documented at surgery. Only three of the second group had positive responses to the ultrasound test. The ultrasound was 870 kHz continuous at 2watts/cm2 for two minutes, administered at the lumbar paravertebral muscle mass. The ultrasound test had a high specificity and very low sensitivity (.09), indicating that sonation of the lumbar nerve roots in people with sciatica is not a useful preliminary screening test of low lumbar disc disease.\r"

Current methods of neurogenic bladder management are often based on professional or institutional presuppositions rather than scientific data. Although there are many unanswered questions about the role of urinary tract infection in spinal cord injury patients, treatment should be based on scientific knowledge, even though the knowledge base is still limited. Preservation of renal function is the ultimate goal of any method of neurogenic bladder management.

The CAS software permits the analysis of data before the next clinical session and includes a method for assessing accuracy and reliability. Sample between-session data show the progress of one patient over several months, whereas within-session data illustrate a use of the CAS to measure a patient's performance under different communicative conditions. Simultaneously, measures of the clinician's communicative performance provide an accurate record of the treatment. This, in turn, allows observation of changes in the patient's behavior as a function of changes in the clinician's behavior. Clinical treatment can thereby be tailored precisely to the individual, optimizing the patient's rehabilitation.\r"

The three-phase technetium bone scan (TPBS), with a combined sensitivity and specificity of greater than 90%, has been recommended for use in the diagnosis of RSDS. The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive value and usefulness of the TPBS in the diagnosis of RSDS and to discover how the predictive value might be influenced by demographic and medical factors (eg, duration of symptoms). A retrospective chart review was conducted of 119 patients who underwent a TPBS as part of a workup for unexplained limb pain. Twenty-five patients met the Kozin criteria for definite or probable RSDS. All patients were injected with technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate and scanned using established criteria. The three-hour delayed image demonstrated a sensitivity of 44%, a specificity of 92%, a positive predictive value of 61%, and a negative predictive value of 86%. The blood-flow and pool-imaging phases added no further sensitivity or specificity to that achieved by the uptake scan in patients with upper-extremity involvement. Blood-flow and pool-imaging did improve the predictive value of the TPBS in patients with involvement of the lower extremities. We conclude that a more cost-effective approach to diagnosis of upper-extremity RSDS is to use the uptake scan alone.\r"

A random sample of 50 women more than 65 years old was recruited from two apartment buildings. The buildings were randomized to serve as exercise and control sites. The 24 exercisers did not differ significantly from the 26 controls except that they were better educated and had better vision. The median compliance was 85% of requested sessions attended by the exercisers. Follow-up measures were obtained in 92% and 81% of the exercise and control groups, respectively. The outcome variables studied were changes in sway (areas and velocity of the center of force as measured using a biomechanics platform) in four stances with eyes open or closed, on two feet, or on one foot. After 16 weeks, in stances on one foot, exercisers had smaller areas compared to controls with eyes open, but larger areas with eyes closed. Subgroup analysis indicated that compliance with the exercise program was a determinant of degree of change in the area measures. The inconsistent effect of exercise on area measures of sway in this study may be due to (a) lack of statistical power to detect between-group differences, (b) inadequate compliance with the exercise program, (c) baseline differences between the two groups at randomization, and (d) ineffective or inadequate duration of the exercise program. We conclude that controlled clinical trials to study the effect of exercise on balance measures in community-dwelling elderly women are feasible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Spastic hypertonia has been defined as a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome. Heightened muscle tone may be the result of changes intrinsic to the muscle or to altered reflex properties. Increased motoneuronal excitability and/or enhanced stretch-evoked synaptic excitation of motoneurons are mechanisms that might enhance stretch reflexes. Two distinct parameters may be altered in the pathologic stretch reflex--the \"set point,\" or angular threshold of the stretch reflex, and the reflex \"gain,\" or the amount of force required to extend the limb in proportion to the increasing joint angle. Earlier studies fail to dissociate the contributions of reflex threshold and reflex gain. Recent investigations suggest that spastic hypertonia may be the result of a decrease in stretch reflex threshold without significant increase in reflex gain, as was previously believed. Various clinical scales, biomechanical paradigms, pendulum models, and electrophysiologic studies have been used to quantify spastic hypertonia. Biomechanical methods seem to correlate most closely with the clinical state. Spastic hypertonia is but one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome, whose features also include loss of dexterity, weakness, fatigability, and various reflex release phenomena. These other features of the upper motor neuron syndrome may well be more disabling to the patient than changes in muscle tone.\r"

Therapists used an adapted form of the physical therapy portion of the Patient Evaluation Conference System (PECSc)--a 14-item assessment measured on an 8-point scale. At admission to a rehabilitation hospital, therapists performed initial assessments of seven motor and functional items on 204 patients and assigned goal scores; before discharge the patients were reevaluated and their final scores determined. The accuracy by which therapists correctly predicted the final score ranged from 53% to 67%; therapists were accurate to within one score for 80% to 83% of patients. The only determinant of accuracy was initial score; neither patient characteristics (age, side of lesion) nor staff experience were found to be associated with correctly predicting final score. Sensitivity and specificity of the goals for predicting independence were examined for three items: lying to sitting, ambulation, and stairs. The sensitivity of a goal of independence was high (96% to 100%), indicating that those patients who were independent at discharge were correctly identified by therapists at admission. The predictive value of a goal of dependence was also very high (91% to 100%), indicating that patients predicted to remain dependent did so. These results suggest that therapists' predictions could prove useful in screening patients for rehabilitation and in planning treatment strategies.\r"

It appears that SW reactivity to autologous breast cancer is prognostically favorable per se and is independent of the prognostic significance of the nuclear grade of the cancer cells; SW reactivity to autologous breast cancer reflects CMI to a determinant(s) that is expressed by glycoprotein 55, the principal envelope glycoprotein of the RIII-murine mammary tumor virus; the glycoprotein 55-like CMi determinant(s) is more regularly expressed by preinvasive than by invasive breast cancers; tumor antigenicity and host reactivity may vary independently; and postoperative monitoring of CMI to autologous breast cancer is prognostically and therapeutically important.\r"

Malignant neoplasms included 33 gastric carcinomas, 35 retroperitoneal sarcomas, 22 resectable pancreatic cancers, and 29 unresectable pancreatic cancers. One hundred thirty-six complications developed among 66 patients who received conventional therapy, and 108 complications developed among 53 patients who received IORT. There was no statistical significance between treatment groups with respect to the overall incidence of complications. Analysis of types of complications by tumor type using Fisher's exact test revealed only one significant complication: an increased rate of sepsis among the patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma who received conventional therapy compared with their IORT cohorts. The overall complication rate associated with IORT was equivalent to conventional radiotherapy in the treatment of these malignant neoplasms and supported the use of IORT where clinically indicated.\r"

This clinical trial compared the efficacy of a single dose of moxalactam (1 g intravenously) with an extended course of moxalactam (1 g intravenously for eight doses) in 1027 patients undergoing contaminated abdominal surgery. The wound infection rate was 5.4% (28/519) for the single-dose schedule and 6.1% (31/508) for the extended-cover regimen (the respective 95% confidence intervals being 3.6% to 7.7% and 4.2% to 8.6%). Over 80% of all patients undergoing abdominal surgery during the period of study were entered into the trial. There was no significant difference in the incidence of other complications between the two groups under study. It is concluded that a single dose of moxalactam is as effective as a 48-hour course when attempting to prevent infection after contaminated abdominal surgery.\r"

Two factors are probably responsible for the appearance of this book. It was written during the 17th century, a period when the number of medical books published in English increased six-fold. In addition, there was a need for texts in English. Most poor people could not afford a physician's care and were ministered to by laymen who could not read Latin. The text of De Morbis Capitis was based on the works of contemporary and ancient authors. It contains chapters on modern syndromes, eg, headache, paralysis, epilepsy, and vertigo, as well as disorders of the time, eg, incubus and phrenitide. Each chapter first describes the disease and its differential diagnosis and then provides remedies, including herbals and bleeding. Overall, the treatment of brain diseases, as outlined in De Morbis Capitis, is probably a description of a high standard of neurologic practice in the 17th century English countryside.\r"

We tested clinically the importance of the model of the normal visual field used to calculate such maps. Forty-one eyes of 41 normal subjects and 58 eyes of 46 glaucomatous patients were studied. Probability maps were calculated by means of two different models of the normal visual field. The first model assumed gaussian threshold distributions with constant variability across the field. The second used empirically determined nongaussian location-dependent threshold distributions. Probability maps using the empiric model allowed better separation between glaucomatous and normal eyes, and the number of significant points in normal subjects was in better agreement with the theoretically expected number. The gaussian model yielded an unacceptably high frequency of significant points in normal fields, particularly in the midperiphery. The clinical usefulness of perimetric probability maps depends critically on the choice of normal visual field model.\r"

For insulin users, 73 (47%) of the 154 who did not have any retinopathy at the first visit developed it in the four-year interval, and 31 (7%) of the 418 free of proliferative retinopathy developed it. Worsening of retinopathy occurred in a total of 34% (142/418). For nonusers of insulin, corresponding rates were 34% (110/320) for incidence of any retinopathy, 2% (11/486) for developing proliferative retinopathy, and 25% (121/486) for worsening. These population-based data clearly indicate the risk of retinopathy worsening in a short interval (four years) in a large proportion of people with older-onset diabetes, a group previously thought to be relatively protected from retinopathy. Such patients who make up the largest proportion of diabetic patients in the United States need examination when diabetes is first diagnosed and regular follow-up.\r"

Increasing medical care needs of veterans of World War II and successive conflicts, and legislatively expanded entitlements, have contributed to sustained growth of the VA workload--which in turn has led to an expanded partnership with schools of medicine and allied health sciences. The affiliations continue to serve both partners well and to contribute substantively to society at large by fostering the production of medical manpower and advances in biomedical research.\r"

Nurses would be able to achieve specialty education either by graduate education or through experience and continuing nursing education. Those nurses who elected careers in management, the social or natural sciences, as researchers or faculty, could build on their strong undergraduate science education.

In other forms of cardiac hypertrophy, however, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, complex ventricular arrhythmias detected during ambulatory monitoring are predictive of subsequent sudden death and there is some evidence that appropriate antiarrhythmic drug therapy may reduce mortality.\r"

  ".W": "A period of significant agitation affects up to 30% of patients after traumatic brain injury. The severity and persistence of this agitation may be such as to require pharmacologic methods as part of the treatment plan. To define which subgroup of patients develop severe agitation warranting intervention and to utilize the information to predict therapeutic responsiveness to tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), we examined cortisol dynamics in 35 traumatically brain-injured (TBI) patients 2-10 months post-TBI. Fasting hypercortisolemia (cortisol greater than 20 micrograms/dl) and/or an absent diurnal variation (1600:0800 cortisol greater than 0.5) was noted in more than 70% of TBI subjects. These abnormalities in cortisol dynamics were not predictive of severe agitation (chi 2 = 0, df = 1, P = 0.99 for hypercortisolemia; chi 2 = 0.163, df = 1, P = 0.7 for absent diurnal variation) and did not differ significantly between TCA responders and nonresponders. The cortisol response to dexamethasone suppression was abnormal (postdexamethasone cortisol value at 0800 and 1600 greater than 5 micrograms/dl) in 34 of 35 subjects and was also not predictive of the presence of agitation. The 0800 cortisol was lower in TCA nonresponders in comparison with TCA responders (8.3 +/- 5 v 17.2 +/- 9). In summary, severe TBI warranting inpatient rehabilitation results in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysfunction. The extent of these abnormalities renders the assessment of cortisol secretion of limited value in making clinical judgments concerning the development of post-traumatic agitation or the management of that agitation by tricyclic therapy.\r"

The internal oblique-iliac crest osseomyocutaneous microvascular free flap was used in 20 patients for oromandibular reconstruction. The internal oblique muscle, based on the ascending branches of the deep circumflex iliac artery and vein, was used to resurface mucosal defects of the oral cavity and pharynx. The iliac bone, because of its length, width, and natural contour, is the best source of vascularized bone for mandibular reconstruction. The improved soft-tissue component of this composite flap markedly improved the functional results. Reconstruction failed in one patient. Eleven patients underwent dental rehabilitation with either a tissue-borne or osseointegrated implant-borne denture. Follow-up of longer than one year showed minimal donor site morbidity.\r"

Arterial and coronary sinus catecholamine concentrations and oxygen content, and coronary sinus blood flow, were measured at rest and during peak symptom limited upright exercise on a bicycle ergometer. There were no significant changes four hours after the first dose of enalapril, but after six weeks of treatment (10-20 mg/day) enalapril reduced myocardial overflow of noradrenaline at peak exercise. The external workload (exercise duration) increased from baseline values after both placebo and enalapril, and there was no difference between placebo and enalapril at six weeks. Heart work, however, was lower after enalapril: stroke work index was reduced at rest and the double product was lower at peak exercise. The reduction in maximal myocardial oxygen consumption after enalapril did not reach statistical significance. Coronary sinus adrenaline concentrations after enalapril and after placebo were not significantly different. The long term reduction of myocardial sympathetic activity on exercise may represent a significant benefit from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in heart failure and may reflect a reduced cardiac workload.\r"

  ".W": "This study has demonstrated greater efficacy of a new percutaneous amethocaine preparation relative to Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics (EMLA). Initially, a double-blinded trial was undertaken on each preparation individually against placebo, as the recommended method of application was different for EMLA (2.5 g applied for 60 min under an occlusive dressing) and the amethocaine formulation (0.5 g applied for 30 min). Thereafter, the two preparations were compared directly, in a double-blinded study using a standardized application for both formulations. The results indicated that both preparations provided significant (chi-square; P less than 0.001) percutaneous local anaesthesia when compared with placebo. The amethocaine preparation produced significant anaesthesia (chi-square, P less than 0.001) after 30 min application. Furthermore, the amethocaine formulation demonstrated both increased rapidity of action and increased duration of effect, as determined by a two-tailed unpaired t test, in comparison with EMLA when application times of both 30 and 60 min were used for each preparation. The results of this study indicate that the amethocaine preparation provided more rapid and prolonged anaesthesia than EMLA.\r"

All patients received morphine sulphate pentahydrate 10 mg i.v. over 30 s, as part of a balanced anaesthetic technique. Venous blood samples were collected for up to 24 h, and plasma concentrations of morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) assayed by a differential radioimmunoassay method. There were no differences between the two groups for morphine elimination half-life (renal failure: 290 min; anaesthetized controls: 286 min), or clearance (renal failure: 533 ml min-1; controls 741 ml min-1). However, the volume of distribution at steady state was greater in the control group (241 litre v. 141 litre; P = 0.002). The peak concentrations of M3G and M6G were greater in the renal transplant patients (P = 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively), as were the AUC (0-24 h) (P = 0.002 and P = 0.002). M6G has been shown to possess analgesic properties in both man and experimental animals, and therefore the increased AUC for M6G may contribute to the prolonged effect seen with morphine when given to patients with impaired renal function.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently established a novel cell line, TF-1, from bone marrow cells of a patient with erythroleukemia, that showed an absolute growth dependency on each of three hematopoietic growth factors: erythropoietin (EPO) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin 3 (IL-3). EPO stimulated the proliferation of TF-1 cells even at the physiologic concentration (0.03 U/mL). We performed binding experiments on TF-1 cells using radioiodinated EPO. The binding of radioiodinated EPO to TF-1 was specific, time- and temperature-dependent, and saturable. Scatchard analysis of the saturation binding data suggested the existence of a single class of binding sites (kd = 0.40 nmol/L; number of binding sites = 1,630 per cell). TF-1 cells were usually maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 ng/mL GM-CSF. The kd and the number of the EPO receptors were not changed by incubating the cells with IL-3, although culturing the cells in the presence of EPO resulted in down-modulation of EPO receptors. The chemical cross-linking study demonstrated that two molecules with apparent molecular weights of 105 kilodalton (Kd) and 90 Kd were the binding components of EPO. Present data suggest that human EPO receptors are very similar to the previously reported murine EPO receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Serially transplanted bone marrow eventually fails to reconstitute lethally irradiated mice. The reasons for this loss of repopulating ability are unknown. We showed that serial bone marrow transplantation changed the ratio of hematopoietic progenitors in bone marrow. The numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) in the bone marrow did not change with serial transplantation. Spleen CFU (CFU-S) numbers decreased with serial transfer but remained at levels which should be associated with engraftment, even on the transfers which were unsuccessful. The CFU-S, therefore, did not appear to be the cells responsible for long-term hematopoietic repopulation. The number of successful serial transfers was dependent on the size of the grafts, and prolonging the time interval between transfers reestablished the ability of the serially transplanted marrow to reconstitute lethally irradiated recipients. Serial bone marrow transplantation dissociated two phases of engraftment. The first unsustained phase was maintained with repeated serial transfer and appeared to be produced by committed progenitors. The second sustained phase was eventually lost with repeated serial transfer and was apparently due to the pluripotent stem cell.\r"

The fractionation was performed with the DS1-1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), which distinguishes early and late CFU-GM. On whole bone marrow cells, rGM-CSF had a colony-stimulating activity comparable to that of known sources of CSFs, ie, the supernatant (SN) of TPA 30-1 or 5637 cell lines, used as control. A greatly reduced activity was observed when CFU-GM were depleted of phagocytizing and E rosetting cells (colony growth of 27% as compared with control). On fractionated CFU-GM, the rGM-CSF activity was even more reduced on both early and late progenitors (18% and 6% of colony growth, respectively). However, when rGM-CSF was used together with rG-CSF at suboptimal concentrations, the colony growth reached values analogous to that of control cultures. A synergistic interaction between rGM-CSF and rG-CSF in stimulating either early or late myeloid progenitors was observed. The results suggest that the activity of rGM-CSF on CFU-GM is mainly exerted through cooperation with accessory cells. r-G-CSF is one of the factors that can synergistically cooperate with r-GM-CSF in the myelopoietic stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of action of the hemopoietic growth factor, murine interleukin-3 (mIL-3), was investigated using an mIL-3-dependent multipotential hematopoietic cell line, B6SUtA1. Murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (mGM-CSF) was as potent as mIL-3 in stimulating these cells. In addition, sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatase, and 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a known activator of protein kinase C, also stimulated DNA synthesis in these cells, suggesting that protein phosphorylation might be involved in the mechanism of action of mIL-3 and mGM-CSF. To assess this possibility, intact B6SUtA1 cells exposed for brief periods to mIL-3, mGM-CSF, and TPA were analyzed for changes in phosphorylation patterns using metabolic 32P-labeling and antibodies to phosphotyrosine. Both mIL-3 and mGM-CSF induced the serine-specific phosphorylation of a 68-Kd cytosolic protein, whereas all three agents stimulated the serine-specific phosphorylation of a 68-Kd membrane protein. Furthermore, mIL-3 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the 68-Kd membrane protein, as well as of 140-, 90-, 55, and 40-Kd proteins. The 90-Kd protein was also tyrosine phosphorylated in response to mGM-CSF. These phosphotyrosine containing proteins were not detected in TPA-treated cells. These results indicate that protein phosphorylations on tyrosine and serine residues occur in B6SUtA1 cells following short-term incubation with mIL-3 or mGM-CSF and that most of these phosphorylation events are mediated by kinases other than protein kinase C (PkC).\r"

C57BL/6-Pgk-1b/Pgk-1a female mice, in which each stem cell had either A-type or B-type phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) owing to the random inactivation of one of two X chromosomes, were used as donors. As a marker of the reconstitution, electrophoretic pattern of hemoglobin was used. The concentration of the stem cells that reconstitute the whole erythropoiesis of WBB6F1-W/Wv mouse was higher in the marrow of donors that had received an injection of 5FU two days previously (two-day 5FU-treated) than in the marrow of nontreated donors. In the marrow of four-day 5FU-treated mice, however, the concentration was comparable to that of nontreated mice. The PGK electrophoretic pattern of WBB6F1-W/Wv mice reconstituted by nontreated marrow cells was comparable to the PGK pattern of WBB6F1-W/Wv mice reconstituted by four-day 5FU-treated marrow cells. Thus, a single stem cell with extensive proliferative potential rather than multiple spleen colony-forming units appeared to be responsible for the erythropoietic reconstitution in the transplantation of nontreated healthy marrow cells as well as 5FU-treated marrow cells.\r"

IL-6 alone or in combination with erythropoietin (Epo), IL-3, GM-CSF, or G-CSF did not induce colony formation. However, IL-6 strongly synergized with M-CSF in stimulating macrophage colony formation (colony numbers and size). The magnitude of IL-6 synergism with M-CSF was dose dependent; maximal potentiation of M-colony formation was evident at approximately 100 to 1,000 U/mL IL-6. When the addition of IL-6 to M-CSF-supplemented cultures was delayed for more than one day after the beginning of culture, enhancement of macrophage colony formation was lost. IL-6 stimulation of M-CSF-responsive colony formation was not apparent when nonpurified marrow cells were plated, most likely due to endogenous IL-6 release. These observations suggest that IL-6, in addition to playing a role in B-lymphocyte proliferation can potentiate the human immune defence mechanism by stimulating monocyte-macrophage development as well.\r"

Alteration of two further residues, to give a five-residue sequence identical to AT-III, does not increase this rate further. Neither antithrombin is activated by heparin; both are unglycosylated and have shorter in vivo half-lives (t1/2) than human alpha 1AT.

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the expression of functional interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptors on leukemic B-cell precursors (BCPs) from 12 BCP acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and five BCP ALL cell lines. The specific binding of biosynthetically labeled 35S-recombinant (r) IL-3 to freshly obtained leukemic marrow blasts was initially investigated. In five of 12 BCP ALL cases, the binding of 35S-rIL-3 was markedly blocked by excess cold rIL-3, and the percentage of inhibitable binding ranged from 53% to 78% (mean +/- SE = 65% +/- 4%). In these cases, the cell-bound radioactivity ranged from 146 cpm/10(7) cells to 1,433 cpm/10(7) cells (mean +/- SE = 627 +/- 250 cpm/10(7) cells), indicating that 1 to 14 femtomole (mean +/- SE = 6 +/- 2 fms) of [35S]rIL-3/10(7) cells were specifically bound (= 60 to 840 molecules per cell). rIL-3 stimulated the proliferative activity of leukemic BCPs in a dose-dependent fashion without inducing differentiation, and the half-maximal stimulatory activity was observed at a concentration of 17 to 34 pmol/L. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)-isolated virtually pure populations of CD10+CD19+ leukemic BCPs from two BCP ALL patients, as well as from two of five BCP ALL cell lines, showed a marked proliferative response to highly purified rIL-3, providing formal evidence that the observed IL-3 responses were not mediated by accessory cells. There was a high correlation between [35S]rIL-3 binding and proliferative response in colony assays, indicating that functional IL-3 receptors were detected in ligand binding assays. Scatchard plot analysis of the specific equilibrium binding data for IL-3-responsive leukemic BCPs from one BCP ALL patient and two BCP ALL cell lines yielded a straight linear regression line, indicating the existence of a single class of 60 to 210 high-affinity IL-3 binding sites/cell. The calculated apparent affinity constant (Ka) values ranged from 3.6 x 10(9) to 5.9 x 10(9) mol/L-1. Hence, the concentration of IL-3 required to produce 50% maximal receptor occupancy (Kd) was in the range of 168 to 280 pmol/L. These concentrations are approximately tenfold higher than those required to induce 50% maximal proliferative response from leukemic BCPs in colony assays, indicating that low receptor occupancy is sufficient for growth stimulation of leukemic BCPs by rIL-3. In comparison, less than 10 to 20 IL-3 molecules/cell were bound to IL-3 unresponsive leukemic BCPs even when the concentration of free-[35S]rIL-3 was as high as 2 nmol/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These patients were staged and treated according to the protocols of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, Southeastern Cancer Study Group, and the Southwest Oncology Group. Univariate analysis showed that a large-cell grade greater than I, WBC greater than 10,000/microL, hemoglobin (Hgb) less than 11 g/dL, age greater than or equal to 55 years, and failure to respond to treatment were all poor prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis showed that large-cell grade, age, degree of capsular invasion, and symptom type were independently associated with survival. Separate analyses of cases with and without leukocytosis indicated differences in survival. In patients without leukocytosis, age, presence or absence of anemia, and treatment response were significant prognostic variables; in patients with leukocytosis, large-cell grade, presence or absence of anemia, symptom type, and treatment response were significantly related to survival. Multivariate analysis showed that age was the only significant independent prognostic variable in patients without leukocytosis; in patients with leukocytosis, symptom type, large-cell grade, and bone marrow involvement were independently associated with survival. We conclude that several parameters, both clinical and pathologic, should be assessed at the initial diagnosis of SL to predict prognosis better.\r"

Second bone marrow transplants were successful in achieving extended survival in 16 of 27 patients with transient initial engraftment but in none of ten patients with no sign of engraftment after the first transplant. The major factors associated with a reduced risk of graft failure were use of radiation for pretransplant immunosuppression and use of cyclosporine rather than methotrexate or T-cell depletion of the donor bone marrow for prophylaxis against graft-v-host disease (GVHD). Among 266 patients prepared for transplantation with cyclophosphamide alone, the risk of graft failure was increased in patients who received previous transfusions and reduced in those who received corticosteroids for previous therapy. Neither cell dose nor administration of donor buffy coat cells affected the probability of engraftment. Although use of radiation in conditioning reduced graft failure, survival was not improved. Posttransplant treatment with cyclosporine and avoidance of pretransplant blood transfusions were associated with improved survival.\r"

  ".W": "In an animal bone marrow transplant (BMT) model that mimics the human clinical condition, we evaluated the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody (MoAb) therapy in eliminating minimal residual disease (MRD) in a leukemic host. Leukemic rats were prepared with marrow ablative but noncurative doses of busulfan (BU) and cyclophosphamide (CY). Two days after syngeneic BMT, rats were treated with MoAb. Although all control rats died of leukemia relapse, 58% of those treated with MoAb were cured without any demonstrable effect on the rate of peripheral blood leukocyte recovery. Furthermore, the level of complement, an important effector in suppressing leukemia proliferation in the normal rat, was not adversely affected by BU/CY, BMT and MoAb. Thus, we demonstrated in an animal model that MoAb therapy may be a useful, nontoxic adjunct to high-dose chemotherapy and BMT in eliminating MRD.\r"

We report the outcome of eight pediatric patients (median age 12 years, range 3 to 19 years) with myelodysplasia who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation between 1984 and 1987. Two of the eight children had developed secondary myelodysplasia after alkylating agent-based combination chemotherapy. Five patients had clonal chromosomal abnormalities, including four patients with monosomy 7. Seven of eight patients engrafted. Two of these seven subsequently died of complications of acute or chronic graft-v-host disease (GVHD), and a third patient died at 21 months of pulmonary fibrosis. None of the patients have had recurrence of disease. The four surviving patients remain in complete remission at a median follow-up of 19 months (range 10 to 44 months).\r"
