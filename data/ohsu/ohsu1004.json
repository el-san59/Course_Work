DESIGN--Survey of patients undergoing cranial and spinal magnetic resonance imaging with questionnaires about diagnoses and intended management plans before and after imaging and quality of life questionnaires at the time of imaging and again four months later. SETTING--Regional magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy unit. SUBJECTS--100 consecutive patients referred for cranial imaging in early 1989; 100 similar patients referred for spinal imaging. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in clinicians' leading diagnoses after magnetic resonance imaging and their confidence in these diagnoses; changes in intended management plans; assessment of the contribution to the future management of the patient; changes in patients' quality of life. RESULTS--Magnetic resonance imaging altered the clinicians' leading diagnoses in 35 of 169 (21%) cases. The clinicians became more confident about their leading diagnoses in 90 of 167 (54%). There was a change in management plan in 113 of 182 (62%). The clinicians considered that magnetic resonance imaging made an important contribution to management in 119 of 162 (73%) patients. Overall, the patients' quality of life was unchanged at the four month assessment. CONCLUSIONS--Magnetic resonance imaging of patients with cranial and spinal problems influences clinicians' diagnoses and management plans, but the quality of life of these patients remains unchanged.\r"

DESIGN--A prospective study of asymptomatic women with normal cervical smears attending their general practitioner and newly referred patients with abnormal smears attending a colposcopy clinic. SETTING--A hospital based colposcopy clinic and an urban general practice (list size 5500) in north west Glasgow. SUBJECTS--197 asymptomatic women attending their general practitioner for cervical smear tests and 101 randomly selected patients attending the colposcopy clinic for investigation of abnormal smears. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Presence of various sexually transmitted infections as determined by culture and serological tests. RESULTS--Of the 101 women with cytological abnormalities, six had current chlamydial infection proved by culture and none had gonococcal infection; of the 197 women with normal smears, 24 (12%) had a chlamydial infection and two had gonorrhoea. Serological studies for Chlamydia trachomatis specific antibody also indicated that a large proportion of patients had been exposed to this agent in both groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in the prevalence of any sexually transmitted disease studied. CONCLUSION--A high prevalence of chlamydial infection is present in women in north west Glasgow irrespective of their cervical cytological state.\r"

SUBJECTS--A total of 18,403 male civil servants aged 40-64 years at entry examination for the Whitehall study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Mortality from cerebrovascular disease (ICD8 430-438) after 18 years of follow up. RESULTS--In all, 262 men with sinus rhythm at entry died due to stroke during the 18 years of follow up. Compared with men with a forced expiratory volume in one second of greater than or equal to 3.5 litres those with a value of less than 3.0 litres were almost twice as likely to die of cerebrovascular disease (rate ratio adjusted for age and systolic blood pressure = 1.88, 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.69). This increased risk occurred within each tertile of systolic blood pressure. Nested case-control analyses were used to control precisely for confounding effects of age, height, and smoking (by matching) and employment grade and physiological risk factors (by modelling). The effect of forced expiratory volume in one second was independent of age, height, smoking habits, employment grade, blood pressure, weight, cholesterol concentration, glucose tolerance, electrocardiographic abnormalities, history of chest pain, and history of intermittent claudication. CONCLUSIONS--Measurements of ventilatory function may assist clinical decisions about whether to treat mild hypertension. Impaired ventilatory function and stroke may share common causes.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the advantages and disadvantages of a shift system of working compared with the conventional on call system for preregistration house officers. DESIGN--A shift system of working was employed in the unit from 1 August 1989 to 31 July 1990. During attachments of three or six months four house officers rotated at intervals of one month among three daytime shifts and one night shift (Mondays to Fridays only). Weekends (48 hours) were worked on a one in three rota by the doctors working a day shift. The views of the house officers working this shift system were sought in writing and by direct interview. SETTING--Professorial surgical unit, Royal Liverpool Hospital. SUBJECTS--The 14 house officers who were attached to the unit for three or six months during their preregistration year. RESULTS--The shift system was preferred to conventional on call without exception. The incidence of chronic tiredness was reduced and formal hand-over between shifts resulted in more informed decision making by doctors while on call. During annual leave it was sometimes necessary to revert to the conventional one in three on call system to ensure that daytime work was completed. Other disadvantages were the long weekend shift and an inequitable distribution of the night shift. The house officers recommended extending the shifts to weekends and working the night shift one week in four. CONCLUSION--A shift system of working was effective in reducing chronic tiredness among house officers, who found it preferable to conventional on call arrangements. Shift working is feasible only if the daytime duties of the doctor working at night can be completed by the other doctors on the rota.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective study based on population data for England and Wales from 1973 to 1984. SUBJECTS--Women aged 15-44 who committed suicide in the year after childbirth or during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Observed to expected mortality ratios for the total postnatal sample, for five year age groups, for unmarried mothers, and for suicide after stillbirth; observed to expected mortality ratios for all suicides during pregnancy and for five year age groups; the timing of suicides in relation to delivery; and the frequency of the various methods of suicide. RESULTS--The standardised mortality ratio for postnatal suicide was calculated to be 0.17--that is, the actual total was only one sixth of that expected. The low ratio was not found after stillbirth, which was associated with a rate six times that in all women after childbirth. The low ratio was less pronounced, but still present, in teenage mothers and in unmarried mothers. Women who committed suicide after childbirth most often did so in the first month, and there was a tendency to use violent methods. The standardised mortality ratio for suicide during pregnancy was calculated to be 0.05 of all pregnant women. Teenagers were at substantially increased risk. CONCLUSIONS--Women in the first year after childbirth and during pregnancy have a low risk of suicide despite their high rate of psychiatric morbidity. Underreporting of maternal suicides is unlikely to explain the findings, though it may affect their magnitude. Motherhood seems to protect against suicide. Concern for dependants may be an important focus for suicide prevention in clinical practice.\r"

DESIGN--Case-control study of patients with the postviral fatigue syndrome referred by local general practitioners over one year. SETTING--General practitioner referrals in Dunbartonshire, Scotland. PATIENTS--254 Patients referred with the postviral fatigue syndrome (exhaustion, myalgia, and other symptoms referable to postviral fatigue syndrome of fairly recent onset--that is, several months) and age and sex matched controls obtained from same general practitioner; 11 patients were rejected because of wrong diagnoses, resolution of symptoms, and refusal to participate, leaving 243 patients and matched controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Detailed questionnaire (patients and controls) and clinical examination (patients) and blind analysis of blood sample at entry and after six months for determination of coxsackie B virus IgM and IgG antibodies and other variables (including lymphocyte protein synthesis, lymphocyte subsets, and immune complexes). RESULTS--Percentage positive rates for coxsackie B virus IgM at entry were 24.4% for patients and 22.6% for controls and for coxsackie B virus IgG 56.2% and 55.3% respectively; there were no significant differences between different categories of patients according to clinical likelihood of the syndrome nor any predictive value in a fourfold rise or fall in the coxsackie B virus IgG titre in patients between entry and review at six months. The rates of positive antibody test results in patients and controls showed a strong seasonal variation. Of the numerous immunological tests performed, only a few detected significant abnormalities; in particular the mean value for immune complex concentration was much higher in 35 patients and 35 controls compared with the normal range and mean value for total IgM was also raised in 227 patients and 35 controls compared with the normal range. CONCLUSIONS--Serological tests available for detecting coxsackie B virus antibodies do not help diagnose the postviral fatigue syndrome. Percentage positive rates of the antibodies in patients simply reflect the background in the population as probably do the raised concentrations of total IgM and immune complexes.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study on all men and women who had their serum sialic acid concentration measured as part of a general health survey in 1964 or in 1965. All were followed up for an average of 20.5 years. SETTING--Geographical part of the county of Varmland, Sweden. SUBJECTS--Residents in the area participating in a health check up in 1964-5 (27,065 men and 28,037 women), of whom 372 men (169 with incomplete data and 203 lost to follow up) and 345 women (143 and 202 respectively) were excluded; thus 26,693 men and 27,692 women entered the study. The study sample was restricted to subjects aged 40-74 during any of the 20 years' follow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Serum sialic acid concentration, serum cholesterol concentration, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index at the general health survey visit; cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular deaths during three periods of follow up (0-6 years, 7-13 years, and 14-20 years), according to the Swedish mortality register, in subjects aged 45-74. RESULTS--Mean serum sialic acid concentration (mg/100 ml) was 68.8 (SD 8.0) for men and 69.2 (8.0) for women; the average concentration increasing with age in both sexes. A total of 5639 (21%) men and 3307 (12%) women died during the follow up period, in whom death in 3052 (54%) men and 1368 (41%) women was from cardiovascular causes. During short (0-6 years), medium (7-13 years), and long (14-20 years) term follow up the relative risk of death from cardiovascular disease increased with increasing serum sialic acid concentration. The relative risk (95% confidence interval) associated with the highest quartile of sialic acid concentration compared with the lowest quartile was 2.38 (2.01 to 2.83) in men and 2.62 (1.93 to 3.57) in women. Similar results were found for deaths from non-cardiovascular disease with relative risks of 1.50 (1.34 to 2.68) in men and 1.89 (1.57 to 2.28) in women, but these relative risks were significantly lower than those for deaths from cardiovascular disease (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.005 respectively). In multivariate analysis of total mortality and of cardiovascular mortality with sialic acid concentration, serum cholesterol concentration, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index as independent variables the impact of sialic acid concentration was virtually the same as in univariate analysis. CONCLUSION--Serum sialic acid concentration is a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality. A possible explanation of these findings is that the serum sialic acid concentration may reflect the existence or the activity of an atherosclerotic process, and this may warrant further investigation.\r"

  ".U": "91137928\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--By audit from January to June 1989 to quantify, separately for hearts, kidneys, liver, lungs and corneas, the possible increases in transplantable organs from brain stem dead potential donors in intensive care units and to compare them with the increases achieved in October-November 1989, during intense, national publicity about transplantation. DESIGN--Prospective audit of all deaths in intensive care units in England from 1 January to 30 June 1989 and subsequent case study of the impact of publicity on offers and donations during October-November 1989. SETTING--15 regional and special health authorities in England. PATIENTS--5803 patients dying in intensive care units, of whom 497 were confirmed as brain stem dead and had no general medical contraindication to organ donation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Organ specific suitability for transplantation (as reported by intensive care units); consent for donation of specific suitable organs; and procurement of specific organs reported as suitable for transplantation and offered. RESULTS--In the 497 (8.6%) brain stem dead potential donors were estimated the organ specific suitability for heart as 63%, kidneys 95%, liver 70%, lungs 29%, and corneas 91%. Refusal of relatives (30%) accounted for major losses of suitable organs of all types. For kidneys the loss was equivalent to 44% of brain stem dead actual kidney donors. No discussion of organ donation was the second most important reason for missed kidney donors, the loss being equivalent to 10% of brain stem dead actual donors. Non-procurement or difficulties with allocating organs was the second most notable cause of missed suitable liver and lung donors; 29% (55) of the offered total of 189 liver donors and 27% (21) of 78 offered suitable lung donors in six months. Non-procurement of suitable, offered organs was rare for kidneys and modest, of the order of 13% and 10% respectively, for heart and corneas. Corneal donation from brain stem dead potential donors might be improved nearly as much (that is, a 78% increase in brain stem dead actual corneal donors) by specific measures to promote corneal donation when other organs are offered as by reducing the overall refusal rate. Restricted offers, non-procurement, and no discussion of donation accounted for nearly equal numbers of lost donations of hearts (each equivalent to 15% of donated hearts). During October-November 1989 when there was intense, positive publicity about transplantation the rates of refusal and non-discussion fell compared with during January-June (22%, 36/163 v 30%, 138/460; 7%, 33/497 v 2%, 4/167 respectively). Offers of suitable donors increased significantly (p less than 0.02) compared with the first six months of 1989, most notably for heart donors (80 v 60.1 expected) and kidney donors (122 v 102.1 expected) but only for kidneys was there a noticeable 17% increase in actual donors (118 actual audited donors v 100.8 expected donors; p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS--Four strategies to increase the supply of transplantable organs from brain stem dead potential donors in intensive care units were identified: (a) reducing refusal of relatives (b) avoiding non-procurement of actually suitable organs (by logistical initiatives) and deterioration of initially suitable organs (by donor care initiatives); (c) converting restricted offers to unrestricted offers; and (d) ensuring discussion with families. Early referral to the transplant team or coordinator gives time for discussion about donor care and agreement on medical suitability for donation of specific organs. Solving some of the logistical problems of non-procurement may be a prerequisite for increased offers to be translated into increased donations. The impact of publicity therefore needs to be measured on offers of suitable donors as well as by actual donations.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the views of directors of public health on the importance of housing for public health and their departments' and health authorities' participation in housing issues. DESIGN--Postal self administered questionnaire survey. SETTING--All district health authorities in England and health boards in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. SUBJECTS--All 221 district directors of public health in England and chief administrative medical officers in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Response to questionnaire consisting of fixed and open ended questions on housing issues. RESULTS--The response rate was 89% (196/221). Housing was perceived as a major health problem by 33% (65/196) of directors. Positive responses were most likely from inner city districts. In 47% (93/196) of departments there was a formal time commitment to housing issues with a median time of one session/week (range one per month to 10 per week). The main function was allocation of medical priority for public sector rehousing. Overall, 73% (144/196) reported some participation in this process. Reported participation in joint care planning and links with non-statutory housing organisations were uncommon. 53% (104/196) of directors had included housing issues in their annual health report. In 16% (32/196) of districts specific services for the homeless had been set up. CONCLUSIONS--Although concern about the impact of current housing policy on public health was shown by a substantial number of directors, the main activity was still allocation of medical priority despite a background of increasing housing need and homelessness. The underlying need is for greater advocacy to produce a healthy housing policy for all, and the annual public health report could be used to promote this objective.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate angiographic success, frequency of branch vessel loss and salvage, and long-term outcome, we studied the early and late outcomes of 56 consecutive patients who underwent PTCA of bifurcation lesions, which involved the left anterior descending or left circumflex coronary artery, with stenoses greater than 70% in both the parent and an involved branch vessel. In 35 patients (63%), the PTCA strategy was attempted dilation of both the main vessel and the involved branch vessels using predominantly a double-wire, sequential balloon technique; in 21 (27%) the PTCA attempt was confined to the main vessel alone. Transient angiographic occlusion of the branch vessel occurred in 32% of patients in whom dilation of both vessels was attempted, and in 38% in whom the main vessel alone was dilated (p = NS); 91% of the occluded branch vessels were the salvaged when sequential angioplasty of both vessels had been initially planned, compared to only 38% when the initial strategy had been dilation of the main vessel alone (p less than .05). Predischarge exercise testing showed residual ischemia in 6% of patients who had both vessels successfully dilated, versus 37% in those in whom dilatation was confined to the main vessels (p less than .01). Clinical restenosis, defined as late (greater than 6 weeks) recurrence of angina or a positive exercise test, occurred in 42% of patients who had both vessels successfully dilated. Thus although bifurcation lesion angioplasty frequently results in transient branch vessel loss, these branches can usually be salvaged using a double-wire technique but tend to have a higher late restenosis than conventional single vessel PTCA.\r"

Multiple exercise hemodynamic, exercise electrocardiographic, and exercise radionuclide angiographic parameters were considered in an attempt to separate the 2 groups. The only parameter that was significantly different between the 2 groups was exercise heart rate. However, no value of the exercise heart rate could meaningfully separate the 2 groups. Despite their known difference in prognosis, patients with left main and three-vessel disease had very similar exercise performance and could not be distinguished from one another by exercise electrocardiography or exercise radionuclide angiography. The inability to distinguish these two groups is a clear limitation of noninvasive exercise modalities.\r"

The hemodynamic measurements and mitral valve area calculations were performed with and without balloon occlusion of the atrial septal puncture site. The mitral valve area determined with balloon occlusion was significantly smaller than the mitral valve area determined without occlusion (1.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.1 cm2, P less than 0.01), and was similar to the echocardiographically determined valve area (1.6 +/- 0.1 cm2). This decrease in the calculated mitral valve area with occlusion was associated with a decrease in the measured cardiac output, without a change in the mitral valve gradient or the diastolic filling period. Occlusion of the atrial septal puncture site may permit more accurate determination of the mitral valve area and thus provide a better reference point for future comparison should the question or restenosis arise.\r"

As a result of this distorted anatomy, during the inflations, the two balloons constantly slipped back into the left atrium before full inflation was obtained. After the procedure, the mitral valve area (MVA), as estimated by echo-doppler (ED), increased from 1.00 to 1.34 cm2. After 2 months of mild clinical improvement, the patient again became symptomatic and ED examination showed a MVA of 1.25 cm2. A second PTMV was performed with an Inoue balloon, the entire procedure taking less than 1 hour. A stable position of the Inoue balloon and complete dilatation were achieved. ED examination showed a mitral valve area of 2.30 cm2. There was no mitral regurgitation nor atrial septal defect.

  ".W": "We prospectively studied 60 ischemic patients with 5F catheters (Pigtail and Amplatz) using the percutaneous right brachial artery approach (group I), in order to compare this technique with two groups of 100 patients each randomly studied by the femoral route with either 5F (group II) or 8F (group III) catheters (Pigtail and Judkins). The following parameters were analyzed: need to change the initially elected catheter diameter or/and artery approach; technical difficulty for obtaining LV, LCA, and RCA angiograms; total time of X-ray exposure; quality image of LV, LCA, and RCA angiograms; incidence of arterial puncture related hematomas or total arterial occlusion; and duration of local compression after sheath removal. There were no differences between 5F brachial and femoral approaches except for the arterial compression time (p less than 0.01) and the X-ray exposure time (p = 0.03) which were longer with the brachial approach. Whatever the route used, 5F showed a mild increase difficulty (brachial p = 0.001; femoral p = 0.01) and a mild decreased quality image for LCA (branchial p = 0.006; femoral p less than 0.05). Mild hematomas were more frequent with 8F catheters (p less than 0.05). The procedure could be completed by the elected first artery and type of catheter (5F or 8F) in 57/60 patients in group I, in 95/100 in group II, and in 96/100 in group III (nonsignificant differences). Thus, the percutaneous right brachial artery approach using 5F catheters is similar to the femoral artery approach with the same catheters. Although both of them showed a mild increased technical difficulty and a mild decreased quality image compared to 8F, mainly for LCA angiograms, they allowed complete and reliable angiograms reading and analysis.\r"

Measurements of both percent diameter stenosis and absolute dimensions were compared to those obtained with hand injection and cine acquisition using 8 French catheters as a \"gold standard.\" While the reproducibility of dimension determination with the 6 French catheter was generally similar to that obtained with the 8 French catheter (0.27 +/- 0.23 mm for absolute diameter and 8.1 +/- 7.4% for percent diameter stenosis), accuracy was significantly less for the 6 French catheter for measurement of absolute dimensions. Thus, while apparently well suited for serial measurements of the same stenoses, 6 French catheters may not be as accurate in the determination of absolute artery dimensions as 8 French catheters.\r"

Contrast injection was assisted with a Hercules pump (Cordis) in all cases. During 21 procedures, angioplasty of 27 lesions in 20 selected patients was attempted (1.3 lesion/procedure). Twelve lesions were in the right, 10 in the left anterior descending, and 5 in the left circumflex coronary artery. Balloon size varied between 2.5 and 3.5 mm. Twenty lesions could be successfully dilated (74%) through the 6 French catheter and 7 lesions required an exchange to a 7 French angioplasty guiding catheter. For 5 cases, another balloon was also necessary to complete the procedure. The final overall success rate was 100% per patient and per lesion and there were no major complications. Despite the small internal catheter lumen (1.22 mm) coronary visualization was adequate, and mechanical support was good. Failures of 6 French catheters were attributed to insufficient torque control and excessive friction when the balloon crossed the tapered end of the diagnostic catheter. Coronary angioplasty through a diagnostic 6 French catheter is feasible and may represent a reasonable alternative for simple cases that are done during the same session as the diagnostic angiography. Once available, 6 French high flow angioplasty guiding catheters without a tapered tip should improve success while retaining the advantage of a small femoral puncture site.\r"

A new 5F catheter design (Sherwood Medical Co., St. Louis, MO) provided a large inner lumen (0.4\") permitting use of 0.20-0.22\" fixed-wire PTCA balloon catheters with good coronary visualization. Potential advantages include reduced coronary artery ostial trauma and catheter induced damping and enhanced patient comfort. We report our initial experience in 14 patients undergoing PTCA with a 5 and 6F guide/fixed-wire system. Mean age was 63 +/- 10 (43-78 years). PTCA indications: Cardiogenic shock (1), post-myocardial infarction angina pectoris (2), grade III angina (5) and unstable angina pectoris (6). Vessel attempted: Left anterior descending (3), circumflex (4), obtuse marginal (2), diagonal (1), right coronary artery (3), and internal thoracic artery (1). Twelve patients had femoral approach; two brachial approach. The USCI Probe (USCI Division, Billerica, MA) was used in 8 lesions and SCIMED ACE (SCIMED Life Systems, Maplegrove, MN) catheter in 7 lesions. Successful 5 or 6F guide/fixed-wire dilations reduced the stenosis (77 +/- 14 to 37 +/- 30%) and were successfully performed in 79% (11/14). One 5F patient required 8F guiding catheter and was dilated with 2.0 fixed-wire balloon. A second failed 5F PTCA could not be dilated with any larger conventional system. A third total occlusion could not be crossed with a guidewire or fixed wire balloon. No patient had a complication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our experience suggests that if medical treatment is not sufficient to treat clinical manifestations resulting from septal perforator disease, then coronary angioplasty can be considered a therapeutic alternative for revascularization. We herein present 11 patients who underwent coronary angioplasty of a major septal artery and discuss angiographic and technical aspects of the procedure.\r"

A review of the case histories for 11 individuals indicates that affected males have highly variable genital and nongenital phenotypes. Physical findings may be clearly apparent or nonexistent. With the exception of external genitalia, the basis for this variability is unknown. It may be related to differences in Y chromatin expression as the result of variable inactivation of the X chromosomes, or to the existence of minor deletions or point mutations secondary to an exchange of genetic material. Common and uncommon clinical problems in these individuals require evaluation and follow-up care that is provided through a cooperative, interdisciplinary approach.\r"

Of the 790 respondents, 30% routinely examine children prior to elective surgery at present, although 60% felt they should ideally do so. Only 7.6% had training contacts with anesthesia during residency, and only 17% felt their expertise was appreciated by the operating team in preparing children for surgery. In clinical management situations, most agreed on the anesthetic risks of a recent-onset upper respiratory infection, but varied in assessing the risks to a growing premature infant, of a patient with Trisomy 21, or of an asthmatic on chronic theophylline. The results suggest that pediatricians see their role as important in preoperative preparation of children, but lack appropriate training and experience. If \"clear for surgery\" is to be a meaningful activity, greater communication between anesthesiologists and pediatricians must be developed.\r"

  ".W": "DMD and BMD are now understood at the genetic, biochemical, and molecular levels. At the genetic level, both disorders result from mutations of the X-linked gene encoding dystrophin. At the biochemical level, DMD results from the deficiency of a large protein called dystrophin, whereas BMD results when dystrophin is present, though abnormal in either amount or molecular structure. To date, thousands of patients have been analyzed for mutations of the dystrophin gene in peripheral blood DNA or alterations of the dystrophin protein in muscle tissue. The severity of the clinical phenotype of these patients has been compared with their dystrophin gene mutations and corresponding dystrophin protein alterations, revealing an unexpectedly high degree of correlation. Thus, information derived from the molecular analysis (DNA or protein) of a particular patient provides a \"molecular diagnosis,\" which is highly predictive of the clinical course that patient can be expected to follow. Because molecular diagnoses are independent of the patient's age, they provide a prognosis for the large majority of muscular dystrophy patients even before clinical symptoms of their disease become apparent. Such prognostic molecular diagnoses have proven particularly valuable when the patient is an isolated case, with no family history for the disorder. Prenatal genetic diagnosis of DMD or BMD may involve use of Southern blot or PCR techniques to search for a deletion in the DNA of at-risk fetuses or more complicated family linkage studies using intragenic and flanking RFLPs. More recently, assay of dystrophin content in fetal skeletal or cardiac muscle from at-risk abortuses has been accomplished, allowing definitive discrimination of affected and normal fetuses in cases in which deletion analyses and family DNA studies were equivocal. In utero fetal skeletal muscle biopsy for dystrophin protein assay has actually been accomplished in at least one at-risk pregnancy in which family DNA studies were uninformative. Dystrophin was present in skeletal muscle from this 20-week-old male fetus, and the pregnancy continued, resulting in the term birth of a healthy male infant. The future holds exciting opportunities for neonatal screening and treatment of these devastating neuromuscular diseases.\r"

  ".W": "The observation of multiple, chromosomally distinct cell lines in chorionic villus samples is not an unusual finding and occurs in 1 per 100 samples. This frequency is ten times greater than the level of mosaicism observed in newborn surveys and, thus, must reflect phenomenon other than true fetal mosaicism. Indeed, only 23% of mosaicism detected at CVS is confirmed in the fetus (2.3 per 1,000 CVS), which is much closer to the newborn rate (1 per 1,000). This indicates that most mosaicism encountered in CVS is unrelated to the fetal karyotype and as such is an inaccurate prediction of the fetal genotype, the purpose of prenatal diagnosis. Most of the mosaicism detected in CVS is due to confined placental mosaicism. Either as a result of error-prone cell division generating an excess of abnormal cells in extraembryonic tissues or reduced selection against aneuploid cells in these tissues allowing their persistence, chorionic villi and placenta appear to show much higher levels of mosaicism than seen in fetuses. This explains the more frequent finding of multiple cell lines in CVS than in amniocentesis or liveborn individuals. The discrepancy between levels of mosaicism present in chorionic villi and fetal tissues means that most instances of mosaicism detected in CVS are not associated with a fetal abnormality and should be evaluated by further prenatal testing, i.e., amniocentesis or fetal blood sampling. Because of the frequency of chromosomal mosaicism in CVS and its attendant need for further testing, a discussion of mosaicism should be included in counseling prior to CVS. The higher frequency of discrepant results in direct CVS preparation emphasizes the prudence of delaying decision making until the results of the CVS culture have been obtained. Although the observation of mosaicism clearly complicates genetic counseling and decision making, it does not appear to be associated with an adverse fetal outcome. Whereas most of the mosaicism observed in CVS is the result of confined placental mosaicism, other types of discrepancies also occur. Maternal cell contamination occurs in about 1% of cases, but is easily evaluated by examining the direct preparation and analyzing chromosome polymorphism. The incidence of pseudomosaicism in CVS cultures is unclear but probably low. Interestingly, CVS analysis has suggested that twinning may be a more common phenomenon at conception than reported at birth and that some discrepancies may reflect the nonviability of twins with abnormal karyotypes. Chorionic villi sampling remains a viable alternative to amniocentesis for early prenatal diagnosis. An understanding of the origins of mosaicism in CVS is necessary for\r"

  ".U": "91138260\r", 
  ".W": "Genetic factors play an important role in the development of many common diseases of adulthood that result in early morbidity and mortality. Prevention of these disorders and their sequelae is best established through early detection and early intervention. Although it may be feasible to screen the entire population for some disorders (e.g., hypertension), this approach would be expensive and impractical for others (e.g., colon cancer). The family history provides an inexpensive and convenient method of identifying families at risk for premature diseases of adulthood. Family screening for a disorder should be recommended if there is increased risk for the disorder among family members, if screening methods are available to detect the condition at an early age or preclinical stage, and if early intervention will alter the course of the disease. For many disorders screening and intervention can prevent the occurrence of clinical disease. The prenatal counseling session affords an ideal setting for identifying families at risk for diseases of adulthood with major genetic components. By reviewing the family history, key family members can be identified and investigated, in order to establish a specific genetic diagnosis. At-risk relatives can then be counseled and screened for the disorder preclinically and premorbidly. The screening and intervention available for a disease depends on the nature of the disorder, our understanding of its physiology and etiology, and our current technology. The disorders discussed earlier are typical of conditions of adulthood that are influenced strongly by genetic factors, especially when they appear in younger adults. Atherosclerosis, colon cancer, and diabetes are complex phenotypes. Each can be caused by single-gene defects, but commonly the genetics are more complex. Empiric data help to establish the risk to an individual in the latter cases. In all three examples, early detection should lead to treatment, which can prevent more serious sequelae: by treating the dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease can be prevented; by removing the benign polyp, malignant cancer can be avoided; and when impaired glucose tolerance is detected, diet and exercise can prevent or delay frank diabetes and its complications. The complete evaluation of individuals at risk for disorders such as those in Table 1 and their families can be a complicated task. Referral to a center experienced in the genetics of common diseases often may be necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

All suffered from severe inanition and required oxygen therapy. The ischemic time was 193 +/- 28 minutes. Post-Tx immune suppression was OKT3 (14 days), cyclosporine (trough levels of 150 +/- 25 ng/ml), azathioprine to keep WBC at 3,000 to 5,000/cu mm (1 to 3.0 mg/kg/day) and following OKT3, a tapering prednisone regimen. Two rejection episodes that occurred in two patients on post-Tx day 5 and 10 were treated with bolus doses of methylprednisolone. The mean hospital stay was 32 +/- 7 days (range, 20 to 69 days). Four patients required treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection: gastritis (+donor, +recipient) in one and CMV pneumonia in two (+donor, -recipient). A fourth (+donor, -recipient) had right-sided Candida empyema six weeks post-Tx, developed CMV and staphylococcal sepsis, and died 64 days post-Tx. One patient required pyloroplasty eight weeks post-Tx and one patient underwent tracheal suture line repair at eight weeks. During a follow-up of 81 patients months (range, 8 to 24 months), one patient had developed Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) induced lymphoproliferative disease in the lung and one patient had developed EBV lymphoma. Three patients are at work, one is continuing rehabilitation, and one is at home. Double lung Tx offers a definitive benefit to patients with emphysema; however, a prolonged postoperative course can be expected. Viral infections remain serious but treatable problems.\r"

Side effects of radiation include pericarditis, accelerated coronary artery disease, myocardial fibrosis and valvular injury. We evaluated the cases of three young patients with evidence of significant valvular disease following mediastinal irradiation. One patient underwent the first reported successful aortic and mitral valve replacement for radiation-associated valvular disease (RAVD) as well as concurrent coronary artery revascularization. A review of the literature revealed 35 reported cases of RAVD, with only one successful case of valve replacement that was limited to the aortic valve. Asymptomatic RAVD is diagnosed 11.5 years after mediastinal irradiation compared with 16.5 years for symptomatic patients, emphasizing that long-term follow-up is important for patients receiving mediastinal irradiation. This study defines a continuum of valvular disease following radiation that begins with mild asymptomatic valvular thickening and progresses to severe valvular fibrosis with hemodynamic compromise requiring surgical intervention.\r"

Band 5 represents the only tartrate-resistant form and is present in bone osteoclasts and in human alveolar macrophages (AMs). This study was carried out to quantify the presence of total and tartrate-resistant AcP (TrAcP) in AMs from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of 11 patients with first stage sarcoidosis and in 13 nonsmokers and 16 smokers serving as control healthy subjects. The AMs from smokers showed an increase in total AcP activity (115.9 +/- 77.8 mU/10(6)); on the contrary, macrophages of patients with sarcoidosis revealed a consistent decrease in total AcP (27.8 +/- 7.0 mU/10(6)) and particularly the TrAcP subtype (14.8 +/- 3.7 mU/10(6)) in comparison with control nonsmokers (AcP = 42.2 +/- 18.9 mU/10(6) [p = NS]; TrAcP = 35.1 +/- 15.1 mU/10(6) [p less than 0.005]). The decrease in TrAcP activity was inversely correlated with the lymphocyte number (r = -0.75; p less than 0.01), lymphocyte percentage (r = -0.62; p less than 0.05), and CD4/CD8 ratio (r = -0.61; p less than 0.05). After six months of follow-up, the cytologic BAL picture returned completely to normal in five patients with full spontaneous regression of sarcoidosis; and also at the same time, normal values of TrAcP activity were restored. Since TrAcP activity can be easily detected, its possible use, along with the lymphocyte count and CD4/CD8 ratio, as a prognostic indicator of the clinical course of sarcoidosis deserves further investigation.\r"

The design was a prospective study of the consecutive cases from July 1987 until September 1988 in the setting of a university hospital of the third level with 1,800 beds. The patients were a consecutive sample of 169 patients who had 184 procedures of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) with TBB performed. They suffered from different diseases: lung nodules or masses, diffuse interstitial disease, alveolar condensation, etc. An FOB with TBB was performed in immunocompetent outpatients, who were kept under observation for four hours and then had a chest roentgenogram taken afterwards. We contacted them again after 72 hours to rule out delayed complications. In three cases, more than 100 ml of blood were obtained during the FOB, without significant hemoptysis being recorded in those patients during the observation period; chest pain occurred in 15 patients during the TBB; pneumothorax occurred in two patients (1 percent), one of whom required admission to the hospital, without requiring chest tube drainage. Other complications are reported (bronchospasm, parenchymal hemorrhage, and pneumonia). In conclusion, we consider the TBB to be a technique with a low incidence of complications for outpatients, so therefore we do not believe that admission to the hospital is mandatory for this type of patient, although we do recommend a longer observation period.\r"

While mechanical variables at maximal exercise were as sensitive as those determined by measuring the PstL/V and RL/PstL curves, mechanics during spontaneous breathing at rest was less sensitive. The derangement of mechanics was more evident than that of arterial blood gases. No measurement at rest was a good predictor of working capacity or of arterial PaO2. A comprehensive exercise examination may be an alternative to resting investigations, which are either more elaborate or less sensitive.\r"

VTh is the point at which a nonlinear increase of VE occurs. Another group of seven asthmatics (age = 11.4 +/- 1.5) served as control subjects. Cardiopulmonary fitness was determined on a cycle ergometer before and after each training session. This study demonstrated that aerobic training, correctly adapted to the child's physical ability, induces the following: (1) a rapid and marked cardiovascular fitness increase; and (2) a decrease in VE over a given work range so that VTh is increased. This is of great importance because hyperventilation is a major determinant of exercise-induced bronchospasm. In contrast, even if high intensity training is well tolerated in an indoor swimming pool, the long-term effects are unsuitable for asthmatic children because the decrease of VTh will involve an increase of hyperventilation, even when exercise is performed at submaximal intensity.\r"

SETTING: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed in the Pediatric Special Care Unit or in the Pediatric Pulmonary Laboratory using an Olympus BF3C4 fiberoptic bronchoscope with a 3.5-mm outer diameter. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six children who underwent diagnostic or therapeutic bronchoscopy for a variety of reasons were evaluated. They ranged in age from 6 to 142 months; 20 were male and 16 were female. INTERVENTIONS: There were no interventions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Of the 36 patients, 29 experienced a fall in SaO2 levels exceeding 5 percent of baseline values. The youngest age group, 6 to 12 months, showed the greatest drop in saturation as compared with the other groups. Desaturation was significantly increased by midtracheal FB. CONCLUSIONS: A decline in arterial oxygen saturation that may be substantial in infants and children undergoing FB examination was frequently noted, especially in smaller infants and when the bronchoscope was positioned in the mid-trachea. Supplemental oxygen and a brisk procedure time will minimize the risk of dangerous hypoxia.\r"

Objective criteria have not been established to determine when to hospitalize these patients. This study evaluated spirometric criteria for that use. Eighty-three patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD were studied; 45 percent were admitted to the hospital while 17 percent of the patients who were discharged suffered a relapse. An FEV1 of less than 40 percent of predicted normal identified patients who required hospital admission or suffered a relapse with a sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.58, and overall accuracy of 0.78. Combining clinical assessment with spirometry led to an improvement in specificity to 0.73 with a minimal decrease in sensitivity. Patients with an FEV1 of 40 percent or greater of predicted normal or no clinical evidence of respiratory distress after treatment may be safely discharged from the hospital. Patients not meeting these criteria are at high risk for relapse and should either be admitted or have further aggressive ED therapy.\r"

Secondary goals were to evaluate the meaning of a \"don't know\" response to these questions and to examine how the associations between snoring and sleep apnea are influenced by demographics. Results from 1,409 patients in a sleep clinic indicated that nearly all levels of estimated snoring frequency were associated with a greater likelihood of sleep apnea. In addition, a \"don't know\" response indicated a likelihood of sleep apnea. In the sample from this clinic, sensitivities approximating 90 percent were obtained in men, and specificities approximating 90 percent were obtained in women, but high diagnostic accuracy (high specificity in men; high sensitivity in women) could not be achieved with the three snoring questions used here. Generally, associations between snoring and sleep apnea were independent of age and sex. Single persons, persons living alone, and persons customarily sleeping alone of both sexes all showed associations between self-reported snoring and the presence of sleep apnea.\r"

Fifty patients were receiving AP as secondary prophylaxis, 36 monthly and 14 twice-monthly; eight patients with a history of PCP served as control subjects. Twenty-three patients were receiving AP as primary prophylaxis, 12 monthly and 11 twice-monthly. Pulmonary function tests, including spirometry, lung transfer capacity for carbon monoxide (Tlco) and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (P[A-a]O2) were evaluated at M1, ie, one month after the diagnosis of PCP, or at the beginning of the AP prophylaxis, and then at three-month intervals (M4 to M13). No differences were observed in the results of spirometry or P(A-a)O2. Among the patients receiving secondary prophylaxis, a significant increase (paired Student's t-test) in Tlco occurred at M7 compared to M1 in the group receiving monthly administrations (p less than 0.01) and in the untreated control group (p less than 0.05); there was no significant difference in Tlco at M13 compared to M1 in the 12 patients who received monthly administrations for this period or at M7 in the 14 patients receiving AP twice-monthly. No significant difference in Tlco was observed at M7 in the primary prophylaxis groups. These results indicate that pulmonary tolerance of AP, as reflected by pulmonary function tests, is good.\r"

  ".U": "91138377\r", 
  ".W": "The thoracocardiograph (TCG) is a new noninvasive monitoring device that measures cardiac oscillations transmitted to the external surface of the thorax. It consists of 2.5 cm in height, elastic inductive plethysmographic transducers placed transversely in the proximity of the xiphoid process to provide changes in cross-sectional area on a transverse plane across the minor ventricular axis. Cardiac oscillations synchronous with each heart beat are extracted from the respiratory signal during breathing with an ensemble-averaging technique using the electrocardiograph as a trigger pulse. The average cardiac waveform at locations near the xiphoid process in normal humans has the appearance of a ventricular volume curve. The latter is also found in the majority of patients with heart disease although in some, outward (dyskinetic) rather than inward motion during systole occurs at one or more locations of the TCG transducers. As in echocardiography, such findings are consistent with ischemic or scarred myocardium invalidating computation of changes in stroke volume from such sites. In anesthetized dogs and critically ill patients with normal ventricular wall motion, changes in TCG derived ventricular volume waveform amplitudes agreed well with changes of thermodilution estimates of stroke volume during atrial pacing and fluid loading in the dogs on the one hand and with application of extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in patients on the other hand. Thoracocardiography has the potential for noninvasive, continuous monitoring of stroke volume and cardiac output as well as for detection of ischemic or scarred myocardium.\r"

Scatchard analysis of 3H-DHA binding to lung membranes showed similar values of the dissociation constant in both groups (Kd = 0.72 +/- 0.22 nM in patients vs 1.22 +/- 0.22 nM in controls; p = NS). The receptor density was significantly increased in patients in comparison with controls, with respective values of 164 +/- 19 and 95 +/- 13 fmol/mg of protein (p less than 0.025), and correlated directly with mean pulmonary arterial pressure (r = 0.82; p less than 0.0005). No significant relationship was observed between receptor number and pulmonary arterial medial thickness. Thus, the increase in receptor density in these patients may be related to adaptative changes in cells other than vascular smooth muscle.\r"

Qbr(s-p) is the volume of blood accumulating in the left side of the heart in the absence of pulmonary and coronary flows. This blood was vented through a cannula introduced into the left atrium and measured. Qbr(s-p) was 76.3 +/- 13.9 ml/min (2.18 +/- 0.37 percent of extracorporeal circulation pump flow) and 22.3 +/- 2.1 (0.63 +/- 0.15) in group A and B, respectively (p less than 0.01). During total cardiopulmonary bypass, pulmonary venous pressure is approximately atmospheric pressure, and no differences in systemic blood pressure, extracorporeal circulation pump flow, and airways pressure were observed between group A and B. Therefore, vascular resistance through the bronchial vessels draining into the pulmonary circulation is reduced in patients with mitral stenosis and elevated pulmonary venous pressure.\r"

Since Doppler echocardiography can detect changes in diastolic filling patterns prior to the onset of either systolic dysfunction or clinical symptoms, we utilized this technique to determine whether detectable changes in left ventricular diastolic filling patterns exist in patients with cystic fibrosis. Among 25 patients, the proportion of left ventricular filling attributable to atrial contraction was significantly increased when compared with age-matched control individuals. When filling patterns were compared with severity of pulmonary disease, worsening pulmonary disease was directly correlated to shifts in left ventricular filling patterns. We conclude that changes in left ventricular patterns of relaxation are detectable early in the course of cystic fibrosis and that such changes are probably progressive. Early detection could lead to therapeutic trials designed to improve left ventricular filling and delay the onset of overt cor pulmonale.\r"

Given the frequency with which right heart catheters are employed to measure cardiac output, it is important to know whether the severity of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation is sufficient to invalidate the measurement of thermodilution cardiac output. Accordingly, the purpose of the present prospective study was to determine the incidence and severity of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation in 25 men (mean age, 58.1 +/- 1.4 years) using Doppler ultrasound. The tricuspid valve was interrogated from two orthogonal views using pulsed-wave and color flow Doppler, either in the presence or absence of a 7-French catheter across the tricuspid valve. The severity of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation was graded semiquantitatively using a validated scoring system. Pulsed-wave Doppler studies showed that the incidence of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation was 48 percent, and that the average tricuspid regurgitation score increased from 0.41 +/- 0.16 to 0.61 +/- 0.17 (p less than 0.01). Color flow Doppler studies showed similar findings. Further, the incidence of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation was not related to the patient's underlying hemodynamic status or right ventricular geometry. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that the quantitative extent of catheter-induced tricuspid regurgitation is small, and is therefore unlikely to be important clinically, particularly with regard to the assessment of thermodilution cardiac output.\r"

To assess the efficacy of the pouch, we measured various factors of pacemaker mobility in 100 patients after long-term follow-up. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of their dictated operative reports: group 1, no pouch or anchoring stitch; group 2, pouch only; group 3, anchoring stitch to pacemaker header or pouch. The average age of the study population was 74.3 +/- 11 years. Total follow-up time was 42 +/- 28 months (group I, 53 +/- 32 months; group 2, 36 +/- 23 months; group 3, 34 +/- 25 months). There were no significant differences when pacemakers were measured for movement in the inferosuperior and lateromedial directions, nor was there any difference in the distance between the incision scar and the pacemaker header in any group. There was a significant difference between group 1 and groups 2 and 3 when the degree of tilt of the pacemaker off the chest wall was compared. This was 46 degrees +/- 34 degrees for group 1 and 27 degrees +/- 26 degrees and 26 degrees +/- 27 degrees for groups 2 and 3, respectively (p less than 0.02 for both). These data suggest that the Dacron pouch does not restrict pacemaker mobility parallel to the chest wall during long-term follow-up but does reduce the angle to which the pacemaker can be tilted relative to the chest wall.\r"

Forced vital capacity showed a slight reduction from values predicted from age and sex matched control subjects (3.39 +/- 1.06 vs 4.06 +/- 0.82 L, p less than 0.05). However, exercise tolerance was significantly lower than previously reported in healthy adults (VO2max = 31.60 +/- 9.12 vs 37.07 +/- 4.91 ml/kg/min, p less than 0.05). Despite the reduced exercise tolerance, the ratio of maximum tidal volume to vital capacity (VTmax/VC) was similar to that observed in healthy adults. The mean dyspnea index (VEmax/MVV) was also normal at 69.4 +/- 19.0. Hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses were within predicted normal limits at 0.67 +/- 0.37 L/min-1 fall in SaO2-1 and 1.67 +/- 0.92 L/min-1 mm Hg PCO2(-1). We conclude that the impairment of exercise performance found in adults with moderate scoliosis cannot be attributed to any important ventilatory limitation, abnormality in lung volume, or impaired chemoreceptor sensitivity. We suggest that the reduced VO2max likely arises from deconditioning and lack of regular aerobic exercise.\r"

Of 29 patients who showed two isolations, 26 (90 percent) had the association. Of 40 patients who showed three isolations, 39 (98 percent) had the association. All 116 patients who showed four or more isolations had the association with appearance of a cavitary lesion. Accordingly, of a total of 185 patients who showed two or more isolations, 181 (98 percent) had the association. Of these 181, 176 (97 percent) showed two or more isolations in the sputum examinations made in the initial three days. Therefore, the sputum examination in the first three days after onset of disease is most important for the diagnosis of disease caused by Mycobacterium avium complex. Since the probability that casual isolation of the organism occurs twice is extremely low, we can make the diagnosis of pulmonary infection caused by this organism by evidence of two or more isolations of the organism in the first few days after the onset of disease, which is associated with appearance of a new cavitary (or infiltrative) lesion. Moreover, theoretical consideration made in this study has led us to conclude that patients who have had a single isolation of the organism together with a new cavitary lesion should be regarded as having an infection.\r"

To estimate bronchial responsiveness, histamine challenge was performed in 23 patients with bronchial asthma (atopic type, 11; nonatopic type, 12). All patients were treated for ten weeks with erythromycin, 200 mg three times daily, orally. After ten weeks' treatment, PC20, an index of bronchial sensitivity, was increased significantly.

In this study, we report an alteration in the release of IL-1 and IL-1 IHA from alveolar macrophages in patients with interstitial lung diseases (sarcoidosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [IPF]). IL-1 activity released from alveolar macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide was increased in patients with active sarcoidosis (mean +/- SD, 2.52 +/- 1.33 U/ml [n = 6] vs 1.38 +/- 0.62 U/ml [n = 15] for healthy non-current smokers [HNS]; p less than 0.05).

We found a skewed distribution of ICU resource consumption, with the \"high-cost\" 8 percent using as many ICU resources as the \"low-cost\" 92 percent. Forty-one percent of admissions did not receive acute ICU treatments, but these admissions consumed less than 10 percent of ICU resources. Reducing the number of patients admitted for monitoring will have a relatively small impact on hospital charges.

Thirty minutes after increasing the FIO2 to 1.0, arterial PO2 had increased from about 100 to about 400 mm Hg, and whole body oxygen uptake (VO2) was decreased 10 percent (p less than 0.05) due to an 18 percent decrease in O2 extraction ratio. During the subsequent 60 minutes of hyperoxia, there was no further significant change in VO2. Cardiac index did not change in hyperoxia, but it increased 10 percent (p less than 0.05) in recovery as systemic vascular resistance decreased. VO2 returned to baseline after 30 minutes recovery at original FIO2 due to increased O2 extraction as well as the increased cardiac output. The decrease in VO2 without a decrease in O2 delivery may reflect maldistribution of blood flow and functional O2 shunting to protect tissue from unphysiologically high PO2. While brief oxygenation is advisable before periods of hypoventilation, the present data suggest that hyperoxic ventilation in these patients with already adequate O2 delivery was counterproductive.\r"

  ".W": "Cor pulmonale is an important consequence of COPD. Although the incidence is not precisely known, it is seen more frequently in patients with hypoxemia, CO2 retention and severely reduced FEV1. When present, it limits peripheral oxygen delivery, increases shortness of breath, and reduces exercise endurance. It is also associated with higher mortality rates independent of other prognostic variables. Numerous factors may contribute to the development of cor pulmonale in patients with COPD, but its primary cause is chronic alveolar hypoxia resulting in pulmonary vasoconstriction, vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. The physical exam, chest radiograph and ECG may be helpful in detecting the presence of cor pulmonale, but because of anatomic changes that occur in the chest, these tests are often insensitive in patients with COPD. Noninvasive diagnostic techniques utilizing Doppler echocardiography and radionuclide angiography allow for detection of RV dysfunction at an earlier stage and in most cases, preclude the need for right heart catheterization. LTO2 is the only therapy shown to improve survival in patients with COPD. However, statistical proof correlating improvements in pulmonary hemodynamics with increased survival is lacking. Bronchodilators, such as the beta 2 agonists and especially theophylline, may have beneficial effects on pulmonary hemodynamics in addition to their effect on respiratory function and are useful in COPD when RV dysfunction is present. Diuretics and phlebotomy are also useful in improving symptoms in appropriate patients. Vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers and ACE-inhibitors may improve pulmonary hemodynamics acutely, but may lower arterial PO2 by worsening ventilation-perfusion matching or blunt the improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics seen with supplemental oxygen. The long-term benefits of these agents have not been proven and their routine use in patients with cor pulmonale due to COPD cannot be recommended.\r"

  ".U": "91138399\r", 
  ".W": "It has been suggested that spirometry should be incorporated into the routine examination of every patient, analogous to obtaining vital signs. To determine the impact of spirometry on the management of outpatients with respiratory disease, spirometry was performed on 150 consecutive patients (123 men and 27 women, mean age 57 +/- 12 years) seen in our pulmonary disease outpatient clinics. Patients with obstructive (n = 75), restrictive (n = 31), mixed (n = 26) or other respiratory diseases (n = 18) were initially assessed by history and physical examination and classified as improved, stable, or worse compared to previous visits. A clinical management plan (CMP) was formulated based on this initial evaluation. Spirometric results were then made available to the examiner who could then make changes in the proposed CMP. The addition of spirometric results caused alteration of the CMP in only eight (5 percent) patients; in the remaining 142 patients, results did not affect the CMP. Two clinical findings identified those patients whose CMP was most likely to be altered by spirometry: severity of lung dysfunction (determined from previous spirometry) and deterioration of clinical status (judged by history and physical examination). Of the eight patients whose CMP was changed after review of spirometry, six (75 percent) had previous severe ventilatory dysfunction (FEV1 or FVC less than or equal to 40 percent of predicted or FEV1/FVC ratio less than or equal to 0.40). In 6 of 38 patients (16 percent) with severe ventilatory dysfunction, CMP was altered after spirometry while only 2 of 112 patients (1.8 percent) with mild or moderate dysfunction had changes in their CMP. Patients who were clinically assessed as worse compared to their previous visit were more likely to have their CMP altered after review of spirometry when compared to those considered improved or stable by a ratio of 6:1. These results suggest that spirometry is most likely to supplement the physician's history and physical examination in the management of outpatients with pulmonary disease when the initial evaluation suggests that the patient has clinically deteriorated since the previous clinic visit, or when he or she has previous severe ventilatory dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium channel blockers have been previously shown to decrease lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and improve symptoms in achalasia. We performed a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study to assess the effects of oral nifedipine and verapamil on LES pressure, amplitude of esophageal body contraction, and clinical symptomatology in eight patients with symptomatic achalasia diagnosed by endoscopy, barium swallow, and manometry. Patients were randomized to receive up to 20 mg nifedipine, 160 mg verapamil, or placebo and underwent esophageal manometry before (baseline) and after four weeks on each drug. Diary cards were kept to record and grade symptoms and drug plasma level determinations were correlated with manometric and clinical findings. Both nifedipine and verapamil caused a statistically significant decrease in mean LES pressure, but only nifedipine caused a significant decrease in the amplitude of contractions of the smooth muscle portion of the esophagus. No statistically significant differences in the overall clinical symptomatology were noted with any of the drugs, although some individual improvements in dysphagia and chest pain were noted. We conclude that, despite the reduction in LES pressure and contraction amplitude of the distal esophageal body, oral nifedipine and verapamil do not significantly alter the clinical symptomatology of patients with achalasia.\r"

During the mean period of follow-up (average 5 years, range 1-11), 75% of the patients needed a new dilatation, with a delay of two years. The results of the dilatation were excellent or good in 80% of the cases. Early complications consisted in two esophageal perforations surgically treated. There was no mortality. We did not observe late complications of the procedure. We conclude that pneumatic dilatation should be the initial procedure in the treatment of dysphagia in suspected esophageal motor disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and manometric data from 97 consecutive patients with idiopathic achalasia were analyzed to see if a distinct subset with vigorous achalasia could be identified. Statistical analyses failed to detect a unique group of subjects based on the distribution of contraction wave amplitudes alone. Because of this, patients falling above the 95th percentile (N = 4, mean wave amplitude greater than 100 mm Hg for each) were compared with those having mean amplitudes above the conventional threshold for the diagnosis of vigorous achalasia (mean amplitude 60-100 mm Hg, N = 4), and with the remainder (N = 89, mean amplitude less than 60 mm Hg). Subjects with mean amplitudes less than 60 mm Hg and with mean amplitudes 60-100 mm Hg closely resembled each other in all measured clinical features, whereas subjects with mean amplitudes greater than 100 mm Hg were all male, were older (67 +/- 4 years vs 47 +/- 2 years; P less than 0.01), and appeared to have somewhat longer duration of symptoms when compared with the remainder (82 +/- 41 vs 44 +/- 10 months; P = 0.4). Chest pain and other esophageal symptoms, basal and residual lower sphincter pressures, and response to first treatment did not differ among the three groups. These data indicate that high-fidelity manometry techniques identify a rare subset of achalasia patients with mean contraction amplitudes exceeding 100 mm Hg that, although older and possibly with greater duration of symptoms, presents similarly to others with idiopathic achalasia. Outcome from conventional treatment is also similar for the \"vigorous\" and \"nonvigorous\" patients, making the distinction of questionable value.\r"

  ".W": "Intraesophageal balloon distension has been introduced recently as a provocative test in the assessment of patients with noncardiac chest pain. In order to examine the effect of balloon location and muscarinic blockade on distension-induced pain, 10 asymptomatic male volunteers were studied on two separate days using a low-compliance perfused manometry system that incorporated a silicone rubber balloon. Five-second-duration balloon distensions using balloon volumes of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 ml of air were performed with the balloon located both 16 cm (proximal site) and 6 cm (distal site) above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) before and after administration of atropine (10 micrograms/kg intravenously) or placebo in a randomized double-blind fashion. A standardized scoring system was used to assess the balloon distension-induced pain. Pain scores varied directly with balloon volume but were consistently higher with the balloon located at the proximal site versus the distal site. This was not associated with any differences in intraballoon pressures between the two sites; however, contraction amplitude orad to the balloon was greater with balloon distension at the proximal site. Atropine significantly decreased pain sensation scores with the balloon located distally but not proximally. This attenuation was not associated with significant changes in intraballoon pressures; however, contractions orad to the balloon were markedly inhibited by atropine with distal but not with proximal distension. These studies indicate that balloon distension-induced pain varies depending on the location of distension. This difference is not explained by differences in esophageal wall tension at the site of distension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As such, they already have been used as surrogate markers of regeneration in tissue. In the present study, the activity of these two enzymes in plasma of rats and regenerating hepatic tissue following a 70% hepatectomy were determined. The results demonstrate that the changes in these enzyme activities in plasma reflect the changes obtained in the liver tissue. Thus, blood levels of ODC and TK can be used as a less invasive and nondestructive means of monitoring the regenerative response of the liver and possibly other tissues.\r"

Significant increase in activities of phase I activating enzymes and a remarkable decrease in the phase II detoxification system in most extrahepatic tissues of the treated animals of all three species was observed. These observations suggest that the prolonged exposure to environmental xenobiotics/carcinogens affects the drug-metabolizing enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract, which may be an important factor in determining the susceptibility of different organs to carcinogen exposure.\r"

The natural killer cell activity was significantly decreased in cirrhotic patients compared with normal controls and patients with chronic active hepatitis. Cirrhotic patients with Pugh's C grade of severity of liver disease had lower natural killer cell activity. The depression of natural killer cell activity in cirrhotic patients was inversely correlated with prothrombin time ratios, and the natural killer cell activity in cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy was lower than in patients without hepatic encephalopathy. Thus, the diminished natural killer cell activity in cirrhotic patients might be related to the severity of liver damage.\r"

Of 170 patients with complete data, gastric varices were observed in 26 (15.3%). Importantly, two distinct subsets of gastric varices were identified: varices distal to the gastroesophageal junction without extension into the fundus, termed \"junctional varices,\" occurred in 11.2%, and varices that were confined only to the fundus, termed \"fundal varices,\" occurred less frequently in 4.1%. Although rebleeding was increased in both subsets of gastric varices, junctional varices were more amenable to sclerotherapy. Patients with fundal varices (N = 7) had a significantly higher rebleeding rate, increased complications with sclerotherapy, and significantly decreased survival (P less than 0.005) when compared to patients with esophageal varices alone (N = 87) who were followed for more than three months. Cumulative survival was not significantly different (P less than 0.08) in patients with junctional varices (N = 19) when compared with patients with esophageal varices alone. We conclude that not all patients with gastric varices have a poor result with sclerotherapy. Recognition of these subsets may improve treatment strategies in patients with gastric varices.\r"

High plasma CCK bioactivities were observed in patients with obstructive jaundice, choledocolithiasis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. Twenty-three samples with high CCK bioactivities were assayed by the same bioassay after the addition of a specific CCK antagonist and by a CCK radioimmunoassay in order to determine whether the high CCK-like bioactivity was due to circulating CCK or other factors. High CCK bioactivities were partially inhibited by the specific CCK antagonist, CR-1409, but the activities were not totally abolished. The residual bioactivities (not inhibited by CR-1409) correlated with plasma bile acid concentrations. The inhibitable CCK bioactivities correlated with plasma CCK levels obtained by radioimmunoassay. Although the bioassay using dispersed pancreatic acini has several advantages for measuring plasma CCK, this method overestimates CCK bioactivities in patients with high plasma bile acid concentrations.\r"

The change in one-year serum cholesterol concentration in subjects using PHM was compared with the change in cholesterol in 741 participants who did not report the use of PHM. Serum cholesterol concentration decreased by 0.073 mmol/liter (2.82 mg/dl) in the treatment group compared with a decrease of 0.036 mmol/liter (1.39 mg/dl) in the control group. After adjusting for confounding factors, excluding psyllium dose, by using a multiple regression model there was no significant difference in the change in serum cholesterol concentration (P = 0.935). PHM dosage information was available for 158 participants. After adjusting for baseline serum cholesterol and confounding factors using multiple regression analysis, it was found that the dose of PHM administered was significantly correlated with the change in serum cholesterol (P = 0.0120). For every 1-g increase in daily PHM dose there was a 0.022 mmol/liter (0.84 mg/dl) decrease in serum cholesterol concentration.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent growth factor for many tissues including the gastrointestinal tract. EGF is present in the gut lumen and is absorbed through the mucosa in the developing animals. In addition, EGF has been found to alter the immune system. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effect of EGF on normal colonic lamina propria lymphocyte DNA synthesis and ornithine decarboxylase activity. Human colonic lamina propria lymphocytes were isolated by collagenase-EDTA digestion. The effect of EGF on Con A-stimulated lymphocyte thymidine incorporation was tested. We observed that EGF suppressed DNA synthesis and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in lamina propria lymphocytes. EGF did not alter the time course of thymidine incorporation into LPL stimulated by the combination of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) and ionomycin. Our data suggest that (1) EGF suppresses DNA synthesis in human colonic lamina propria lymphocytes as well as ODC activity and (2) this inhibition may be mediated through protein kinase C or calcium flux. We postulate that EGF may have a role in modulating the human gut immune system.\r"

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP, 10(-8) and 10(-12) M) had no effect on the concanavalin A-induced proliferation or the spontaneous cytotoxicity against K-562 targets by either lymphocyte type. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes had a mean of 927 vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors per cell with a Kd of 1.12 x 10(-10) M, as demonstrated by the competitive displacement of [125I]peptide by unlabeled peptide using Scatchard analysis. In contrast, intraepithelial lymphocytes had no high-affinity receptors as shown by the negligible binding of 50 pM [125I]VIP. Peptide binding by peripheral blood lymphocytes, although reduced by exposure to dithiothreitol and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, was still greater than binding by intraepithelial lymphocytes. As intraepithelial lymphocytes are mainly CD8+ T cells, the possibility that this phenotype may not bind VIP at all was tested by specifically depleting peripheral blood lymphocytes by antibody and complement lysis. Peripheral blood lymphocytes expressing CD8, CD4, and/or CD2 were responsible for most of the binding, indicating that CD8+ T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and in the intestinal epithelium differ in their capacity to bind VIP.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to evaluate in Crohn's disease the possible usefulness of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in the early detection of postoperative asymptomatic recurrence. Eleven adult patients with small bowel Crohn's disease undergoing elective resection were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed for one year. Three, six, and 12 months after surgery the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration were measured, and the disease activity was assessed. All patients were free of active symptoms throughout the study. One year after surgery small bowel radiology was performed in all patients. Radiographic evidence of recurrent macroscopic disease was found in five of the 11 patients. Three months after surgery both alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than before surgery. There was no difference at this time between patients with recurrence and those with no recurrence. In patients with recurrence both alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration significantly increased at six months in comparison with the values at three months (P less than 0.02). Both measurements were significantly higher at six and 12 months in this group of patients than in those with no recurrence and in normal controls (P less than 0.01). At six and 12 months alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance was above the upper normal limit in all patients with recurrence. We conclude that fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance is a noninvasive, inexpensive, sensitive marker of asymptomatic recurrence in CD patients who are under regular supervision after surgery.\r"

Only after extensive evaluation, was the patient found to have porphyria. On two separate occasions, with hematin therapy, her serum amylase decreased, as did her clinical symptoms of porphyria and her urinary quantitative porphyrins. This suggests an association between elevation of the serum amylase and lipase with acute porphyria. Moreover, this association can lead to delay in establishing the diagnosis of acute porphyria.\r"

A reliable noninvasive method by which the presence of cerebral edema could be determined is much needed. To assess the efficacy of computed tomography of the brain in this setting, we compared the radiographic findings to the intracranial pressure measured by an epidural monitor in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Unfortunately, a considerable difference existed between the presence of cerebral edema diagnosed by computed tomography of the brain and elevation of the intracranial pressure. Our observations suggest that in patients with fulminant hepatic failure and advanced hepatic encephalopathy, computed tomography of the brain is of little value in detecting cerebral edema. Pressure monitoring is most important to establish the presence and guide the therapy of intracranial hypertension.\r"

The numbers of microvilli in dilated bile canaliculi were decreased in the rats treated with phalloidin for 1 wk. In hepatocytes the cytoplasm around bile canaliculi could be divided into three layers, increased microfilament layer, cell organelle layer of secretory system and increased smooth surface endoplasmic reticulum layer. In the rats treated with phalloidin for 4 wk, microfilaments were extended into the cytoplasm near the nucleus in addition to the increased number of large lysosomes and microtubules. In both groups, three-dimensional structures of microfilaments could be visualized around bile canaliculi and along cell borders by the quick-freezing and deep-etching method. The branching microfilaments with the diameters of 7 to 10 nm were directly attached to other filaments, cell organelles or cytoplasmic sides of cell membranes. Moreover, bundled intermediate filaments were increased around peribiliary microfilaments associated with long-term cholestasis. It is suggested that excessive accumulation of peribiliary microfilaments disturb the secretion of bile components into bile canaliculi. The cytoskeletal reorganizations of intermediate filaments seem to alter the arrangements of various cell organelles.\r"

Previous studies from our laboratory indicated excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in hepatocytes succeeded by rapid glycogen breakdown and suppressed cell division in rats receiving CCl4 after previous dietary exposure to 10 ppm chlordecone. Since calmodulin plays a major role in Ca2(+)-regulated events and has been reported to be localized in mitotic apparatus during cell division, we have assessed subcellular distribution of calmodulin and estimated cytosolic phosphorylase a to indicate cytosolic free Ca2+ levels in livers of rats fed 0 ppm or 10 ppm (chlordecone) in the diet for 15 days before CCl4 (100 microliters/kg) administration to understand the role of Ca2(+)-calmodulin in chlordecone + CCl4 toxicity. Hepatotoxicity was assessed by determining serum AST and ALT succeeded by histopathological observations of liver sections. Serum aminotransferases were significantly elevated 6 hr after CCl4 administration to normal rats and returned to control level by 24 hr. However, serum AST and ALT elevations were severalfold higher, and progressive increase was observed starting 4 hr after CCl4 administration to chlordecone rats. Histopathological observations of liver sections for necrotic, swollen and lipid-laden cells provided findings commensurate with the serum enzyme data. These data indicate that normal rats do recover from CCl4 hepatotoxicity. However, the CCl4 hepatotoxicity is progressive in chlordecone rats without recovery. In normal rats, CCl4 administration resulted in a slight increase in phosphorylase a starting at 6 hr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Independent of the direction of perfusion, radioactivity was accumulated in a small perivenous liver parenchymal cell population, which surrounded the terminal hepatic venules as a layer of about two to five cells thick. In contrast, accumulation of radioactivity in periportal hepatocytes was low and sometimes not detectable. This distribution pattern roughly resembled that described for the immunohistochemical distribution of glutamine synthetase in liver. The present histoautoradiographic findings demonstrate a predominant uptake of vascular glutamate, aspartate and ketoglutarate into a small perivenous cell population. They confirm previous label incorporation studies in the metabolically intact liver, demonstrating an almost exclusive uptake of vascular glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate into perivenous glutamine synthetase containing hepatocytes. In addition, evidence is presented suggesting that perivenous uptake of alpha-ketoglutarate may be one determinant for hepatic glutamine synthesis, at least under the experimental conditions used here.\r"

Intracellular transport and degradation of endocytosed material were studied by subcellular fractionation in sucrose and Nycodenz gradients after intravenous injection of the ligand. By using ligands labeled with 125I-tyramine-cellobiose, the subcellular distribution of labeled degradation products can be studied because they are trapped at the site of formation. The results show that the kinetics of intracellular transport are different in hepatic parenchymal, endothelial and Kupffer cells. In endothelial cells, the ligand is associated with two types of endosomes during the first minutes after internalization and then is transferred rapidly to the lysosomes. In parenchymal cells, 125I-tyramine-cellobiose-asialoorosomucoid was located in a relatively slowly sedimenting vesicle during the first minute after internalization and subsequently in denser endosomes. Degradation of 125I-tyramine-cellobiose-asialoorosomucoid in parenchymal cells started later than that of 125I-tyramine-cellobiose-formaldehyde-treated serum albumin in endothelial cells. Furthermore, the ligand seemed to be transferred relatively slowly from endosomes to lysosomes, and most of the undegraded ligand was in the endosomes. The rate-limiting step of proteolysis in parenchymal cells is probably the transport from endosomes to lysosomes. In Kupffer cells, most 125I-tyramine-cellobiose-microspheres are found as undegraded material in very dense endosomes up to 3 hr after injection. After 20 hr, most of the ligand is degraded in lysosomes distributed at a lower density than the endosomes in Nycodenz and sucrose gradients.\r"

This study was undertaken as an initial attempt to establish a possible role of defective receptor-mediated endocytosis in liver injury by investigating whether differences exist in the effects of ethanol on receptor-mediated endocytosis in hepatocytes isolated from different regions of the liver. Perivenule cells, present in the distal half of the liver, are thought to be more susceptible to ethanol-induced liver injury than are the periportal cells located in the proximal half of the liver acini. For these studies, we fed male Sprague-Dawley rats for 7 days with liquid diets containing either ethanol (36% of calories) or isocaloric carbohydrate. Perivenule and periportal hepatocytes were then isolated using a digitonin-collagenase perfusion method. In control animals, cells isolated from the perivenule region bound significantly more ligand than did cells from the periportal region. Amounts of ligand internalized and degraded were also greater in perivenule than in periportal cells in these animals. After ethanol feeding, cells isolated from both the perivenule and periportal regions bound significantly less ligand than their respective controls. This impairment in surface and total binding was more pronounced in perivenule than in periportal cells. Internalization and degradation of the ligand were also more adversely affected in the centrilobular region as shown by decreases of greater than 60% in perivenule cells and by only 20% to 30% in periportal cells of ethanol-fed animals compared with controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We, therefore, sought to correlate circulating concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 to clinical and biochemical parameters of liver disease in chronic alcoholic patients. We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure plasma tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 and a bioassay to measure serum interleukin-6 in three groups of alcoholic men as follows: (a) actively drinking alcoholic men without evidence of chronic liver disease, (b) nondrinking alcoholic men with stable cirrhosis and (c) patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis. Mean cytokine concentrations were elevated in cirrhotic patients and alcoholic hepatitis patients compared with controls and alcoholic patients without liver disease. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 alpha concentrations remained elevated for up to 6 mo after diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis, whereas interleukin-6 normalized in parallel with clinical recovery. Concentrations of all three cytokines were correlated with biochemical parameters of liver injury and hepatic protein synthesis plus serum immunoglobulin concentrations. We could not demonstrate a relationship between cytokine concentrations and peripheral endotoxemia. Percentages of peripheral blood monocytes that reacted with monoclonal antibodies to CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor) and human lymphocyte antigen-DR were similar for alcoholic patients and controls. These data suggest that tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 alpha are related to some of the metabolic consequences of both acute and chronic alcohol-induced liver disease, whereas interleukin-6 is related to abnormalities seen in acute liver injury.\r"

In vivo glucose uptake of different tissues and isolated liver cells was determined by a sequential double labeling version of the 2-deoxyglucose technique. After latex administration, glucose uptake more than doubled in the liver, increased by about 50% in the spleen and lung and was not changed in muscle and testis. Within 10 min after intravenous injection of latex beads, neutropenia developed, with no change in the number of lymphocytes. This was accompanied by a marked influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the liver. Latex was found in 52%, 35%, and 14% of the isolated Kupffer cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and endothelial cells, respectively. In vivo glucose uptake increased by 111%, 142%, and 43% in these cells. Glucose uptake by the latex-free hepatocytes was also elevated, presumably by way of intercellular signals between parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells. Indomethacin pretreatment resulted in the delay of neutrophil immigration into tissues without any change in the glucose response of different liver cells. Thus phagocytic stimulation in vivo results in marked neutropenia, migration of neutrophils into the liver, increased glucose uptake by phagocytic cells of the liver and enhanced glucose metabolism by the non-phagocytic parenchymal cells.\r"

Rounded, multicellular aggregates of hepatocytes are seen if the cells are plated onto Matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane, whereas a flattened, monolayer of hepatocytes is observed with Vitrogen. Hepatocellular protein synthesis is much greater on the Matrigel, although collagen biosynthesis appears selectively enhanced on Vitrogen-grown hepatocytes. We determined that denatured type I collagen could be substituted for Matrigel as the substratum, with the hepatocytes remaining the same both morphologically and biochemically. This suggested that the cells respond to the biophysical state of the extracellular matrix not only to protein sequences that determine a binding site. Measurement of steady-state messenger RNA levels within cells cultured onto different matrices indicated that the fluid substrate of either Matrigel or denatured type I collagen were facilitative for induction of cytochrome P-450b/e, which was not seen with the rigid type I collagen substrata. In contrast the messenger RNA level for the cytoskeletal protein actin was decreased on the fluid matrices, suggesting that the rounded cells had a lower requirement for this protein. These findings indicate that hepatocytes are responsive to the biophysical state of the extracellular matrix, which can lead to significant changes in gene expression by the cells.\r"

We have studied the expression of laminin, the major noncollagenous glycoprotein of basement membrane, and the laminin receptor 32 kD laminin-binding protein in two rat (Faza 967 and HTC) and two human (HepG2 and HBGC2) hepatoma cell lines that express a variety of liver-specific functions. Laminin was found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of these cells when the indirect immunoperoxidase method and electron microscopic examination were used. Radiolabeled laminin, immunoprecipitated from both media and cell extracts, was resolved by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel in two major polypeptides that comigrated with the A and B subunits from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor laminin. Immunoblot analysis showed that the Mr = 400,000 polypeptide did not correspond to the A subunit of laminin. Northern blot analyses demonstrated large amounts of B1 and B2 mRNAs but no A chain mRNA. We conclude that the tumor cells produce the laminin B chains only. In contrast, normal adult hepatocytes from either man or rat lacked laminin mRNAs, whereas in 1-day primary culture, B chain mRNAs became detectable. The steady-state level of 32 kD laminin-binding protein mRNA was 10-fold and threefold higher in rat hepatoma cells than in freshly isolated and 1-day cultured normal rat hepatocytes, respectively. In human hepatocytes, the steady-state levels of 32 kD laminin-binding protein mRNAs varied depending on the donor and never reached the level of the human hepatoma cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During 6 hr of anaerobic incubation without additional substrate, viability decreased rapidly in FU5 and HTC cells, whereas viability of HepG2 cells was not significantly affected. In all tumor cells, 10 mmol/L glucose prevented hypoxic cell injury almost completely. Lactate formation from glucose was about five times higher than in hepatocytes under these circumstances. ATP content of the tumor cells remained almost constant under anaerobic conditions in the presence of glucose. Ten millimoles per liter of fructose diminished glycolysis in the hepatoma cells compared with glucose, ranging from 87% reduction in HTC cells to 43% reduction in HepG2 cells. Accordingly, ATP content decreased rapidly in the FU5 and slowly in the HepG2 cells. Viability was strongly diminished in the HTC and FU5 cells in the presence of fructose, whereas in the HepG2 cells no effect of fructose on viability was detectable. In contrast to the hepatoma cells, rat and human hepatocytes exhibited higher rates of anaerobic glycolysis in the presence of fructose and thus were able to maintain their viability under these conditions. These differences in glycolytic capacity, energy metabolism and hypoxia tolerance of hepatoma cells compared with hepatocytes may be used for the treatment of liver cancer by isolated liver perfusion and ex situ revision of the organ.\r"

In this study, we experimentally tested whether cyclosporine exerts any effects on the growth of carcinogen-initiated liver cells using the short-term assays of rat liver carcinogenesis. Dietary cyclosporine, which maintained sufficient levels of blood cyclosporine and suppressed host immune functions, enhanced the development of the glutathione S-transferase, placental form-positive hepatocyte foci in the liver of male F-344 rats treated with a single weekly dose of diethylnitrosamine (75 mg/kg) for 3 wk. Dietary cyclosporine also accelerated the growth of preformed glutathione S-transferase, placental form-positive foci induced by a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (250 mg/kg) followed by the promoting regimen of a choline-deficient diet. It is possible that the enhancement of the size of hepatocyte foci by cyclosporine could be due to stimulation of growth or inhibition of regression. The mechanisms by which cyclosporine modifies the growth of preneoplastic lesions in the liver are not yet fully understood. Possible involvement of immunologically relevant cells in the liver, Kupffer cells and pit cells in the process is suggested.\r"

Sections of normal liver and tumor and non-tumor-bearing liver disease tissue were hybridized in situ with [35S]-labeled insulin-like growth factor II oligonucleotide probe. Parallel sections were tested for presence of insulin-like growth factor II polypeptide using immunohistochemistry. To investigate a possible role for hepatitis B virus in insulin-like growth factor II gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma, results were analyzed against patient seropositivity for hepatitis B virus. Levels of insulin-like growth factor II transcripts in normal liver (n = 4) sections and in those from non-tumor-bearing individuals (n = 10) were so low that specific signal was not detectable above homogeneous tissue background. In contrast, 4 of 8 (50%) of the sections of hepatocellular carcinoma arising from cirrhosis or noncirrhotic chronic liver disease with hepatitis B virus involvement showed increased expression of insulin-like growth factor II messenger RNA transcripts. Up-regulation was observed in cell foci in the hepatocellular regions of the surrounding cirrhotic lobular cells and the fibrous septa. Numerous cell foci were observed in patch distribution in the tumor areas. The level of insulin-like growth factor II messenger RNA transcripts in sections of hepatocellular carcinoma arising from cirrhotic and noncirrhotic tissues obtained from patients seronegative for hepatitis B virus was similar to that of normal liver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In Taiwan, hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the major malignancies in children between 5 and 14 yr of age. We studied the status of hepatitis B virus DNA in the hepatocellular carcinoma and nontumorous liver tissues of eight children with positive serum HBsAg and maternal HBsAg. The hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from five of the eight children showed integration of hepatitis B virus DNA into host cellular DNA sequences. A pattern of single-site integration in four children and a multiple-site integration pattern in one child were demonstrated. In the remaining three children, hepatitis B virus DNA could not be demonstrated in the tumor tissues. Using subgenomic fragments of the hepatitis B virus genome as probes, we found that the X gene fragment and the surface antigen gene fragment were the most conserved sequences. The single-site integration of hepatitis B virus DNA in childhood hepatocellular carcinoma may have hit the critical region, resulting in insertional mutagenesis and early development of hepatocellular carcinoma. With a short incubation period and less exposure to environmental carcinogens during early life, childhood hepatocellular carcinoma may provide a good model to study the carcinogenic potential of hepatitis B virus.\r"

In this study, binding characteristics of interferon-alpha to peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection were studied using radioiodinated recombinant interferon-alpha 2b to determine interferon-alpha receptor numbers and dissociation constants. A single class of interferon-alpha receptor was demonstrated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mononuclear subsets. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (n = 20) and controls (n = 16) expressed a similar number of interferon-alpha receptors (484 +/- 175 vs. 511 +/- 168 sites/cell respectively, p = NS) with a similar dissociation constant (dissociation constant approximately 0.2 to 0.7 nmol/L). Expression of interferon-alpha receptors was similar in monocyte-enriched and lymphocyte-enriched fractions in both groups. Similar changes were observed in patients receiving alpha-interferon therapy. There was no correlation between interferon-alpha receptors expression and serum transaminase, serum HBsAg, serum HBV DNA, liver histological findings or the response to interferon-alpha therapy. After incubation of lymphocytes in vitro with interferon-alpha 2b (10 to 1,000 U/ml), interferon-alpha receptors number dropped by 42% to 80%, but this was associated with an increase in binding affinity (dissociation constant approximately 0.05 to 0.15 nmol/L) in both patients and controls. There was significant delay in the initial phase of receptor recovery in the patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection compared with normal controls (days 1 and 2, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of ursodeoxycholic acid administration on liver function tests and on bile acid metabolism was investigated in 18 patients with chronic active hepatitis. Three different doses of ursodeoxycholic acid--250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg--were administered daily to each patient for consecutive 2-mo periods. The order of doses was randomly assigned according to a replicated Latin-square design. A significant decrease in serum transaminases and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase occurred with the lowest dose of ursodeoxycholic acid, which corresponded to 4 mg/kg body wt/day, and no further significant decrease with the higher doses was seen. Biliary bile acid composition was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. At entry the relative proportions of major bile acids were similar to those observed in normal individuals. During treatment the mean percentage of ursodeoxycholic acid in bile (22% with the 250 mg dose, 32% with the 500 mg dose and 34% with the 750 mg dose) was lower than values previously reported for patients with gallstones and normal liver function. The major bile acids were cholic, chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids. A number of unusual bile acids were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, but these accounted for only 3% to 5% of the total and did not change during ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. No correlation between the improvement in liver function tests and the percentage of ursodeoxycholic acid in bile existed. These data suggest that even a slight enrichment of bile with ursodeoxycholic acid, as is attained with 250 mg/day, is effective in improving biochemical markers of liver function in patients with chronic active hepatitis.\r"

The sequence of this hepatitis delta virus isolate shares an 86% to 88% similarity with the three published hepatitis delta virus RNA sequences, suggesting heterogeneity of hepatitis delta viruses from different geographical areas. Four highly conserved, long stretches of sequence were found. These four regions corresponded to the sequences required for the autocatalytic cleavage activities of the genomic and antigenomic RNAs and the middle and the carboxyl terminal parts of the open reading frame for the delta antigen on the antigenomic strand. The conservation of nucleotide sequence in these four regions was further confirmed by sequencing additional hepatitis delta virus RNAs obtained from three patients with chronic delta hepatitis who lived in Los Angeles. These findings suggest that the conserved sequences are critical for viral replication. These conserved regions offer ideal sites for primer selection to carry out polymerase chain reactions to detect hepatitis delta virus RNA in patients with hepatitis delta virus infection.\r"

Thirty rats were separated into groups of 10, control (sham operation), complete portal ligation only and complete portal ligation plus devascularization. Two weeks after the surgery, the presence of esophageal varices in rats with complete portal ligation plus devascularization was confirmed by portography and by the histological findings. The diameter (mean +/- SD) of the submucosal veins of the lower esophagus in the complete portal ligation plus devascularization group (219.4 +/- 86.6 microns) was significantly larger than that in the complete portal ligation group (99.8 +/- 53.4 microns) or in the control group (30.5 +/- 16.6 microns) (p less than 0.01). Vascular structures of the lower esophagus closely resembled those in humans with esophageal varices. This new technique is simple, rapid and reliable, and application can be made to various experimental studies on portal hypertension.\r"

Cytokines regulate the intermediary metabolism of amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and minerals. Cytokines partially interact with classical hormones such as glucocorticoids, resulting in a complex network of mutual control. Since many cytokines exert growth factor-like activities in addition to their specific proinflammatory effects, the distinction between cytokines and growth factors is somewhat artificial. The liver is an important site of synthesis and the major clearance organ for several cytokines. In liver disease, cytokines are involved in the onset of intrahepatic immune responses (e.g., during viral hepatitis), in liver regeneration (e.g., after partial hepatectomy) and in the fibrotic and cirrhotic transformation of the liver such as chronic chemical injury or viral infection. Further studies of cytokine actions may lead to a better understanding of liver diseases and to the development of new immunomodulating therapeutic options.\r"

It could be observed that the resuscitation with Ringer's lactate did not lead to any increased lymph flow or total transcapillary protein flow in spite of the drop in protein and oncotic pressure in plasma. With Ringer's lactate there was a lower lymph to plasma protein ratio, which might be significant. No negative difference could be observed either in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or pulmonary vessel resistance. All animals survived throughout the experiment, and in all experiments no advantages regarding the vital parameters could be ascertained with the administration of albumin; however, several factors must be borne in mind. The inhalation injury was from a heat source alone and no toxic substances were involved. Only inhalation trauma was induced in the absence of a surface burn wound. The duration of the observation was for only 36 hours. Thus some caution must be observed in applying these findings to a clinical situation. In our evaluation of the clinical results, we have seen that no differences could be established in regard to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and extravascular lung water between the Ringer's lactate and the albumin group. In spite of a 50% drop in oncotic pressure, however, this is only valid for the first 24 to 36 hours, after which one could assume that a further protein drop coupled with a still raised hydrostatic filtration coefficient would lead to interstitial edema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Burn injury and intradermal injection of bradykinin or histamine cause permeability changes visualized as dye-release lesions in the skin of guinea pigs injected intravenously with Evans blue dye. Antihistamine pretreatment ablates the histamine but not the effect of thermal injury or bradykinin. Bradykinin is generated via activation of Hageman factor in a two-step reaction. Steps 1 and 2 can be inhibited by corn trypsin inhibitor and soy bean trypsin inhibitors, respectively. Dye-release lesions were reduced from thermal injury and bradykinin injections when these substances were injected into the skin first. Angiotensin-converting enzyme deactivates bradykinin by degrading it. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor neutralizes angiotensin-converting enzyme. Dye-release lesions from both thermal injury and bradykinin injection were enhanced because of continued bradykinin build-up when these treatments were preceded by subcutaneous injections of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Thus bradykinin is generated in thermal injury via the Hageman factor-dependent pathway. Hageman factor sits at the apex of a series of interrelated cascade systems, all of which impinge on the animal's immune status. Uncontrolled Hagemen factor activation in thermal injury may be the link among all the events collectively known as the \"post thermal injury immunosuppression syndrome.\"\r"

  ".W": "Cultured human keratinocytes are used for skin grafts, but their success is limited by late graft loss. Development of antibody to fetal bovine serum (FBS) protein used in culture media for in vitro keratinocyte growth has been identified. The persistence of FBS antigen in skin grafts is important in the induction of the immune response and the susceptibility of the keratinocytes to immune-mediated injury. The magnitude and longevity of FBS protein persistence on human keratinocytes was studied. Secondary passage human keratinocytes were grown in media supplemented with 5% FBS. The media was changed to one supplemented with pooled human AB serum, and the amount of FBS protein incorporated in the tissue was measured over the following 8 days by an ELISA reaction directed against FBS antigen. Incorporated FBS antigen decreased for the first 3 days to 31% of maximum. There was no further significant decrease for 5 days. Keratinocytes grown in alternative serum supplements (NuSerum [Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, Mass.] and Serum Plus [Hazelton Research Products Inc., Lenexa, Kan.]), which contain reduced amounts of FBS, offered no significant reduction in FBS protein incorporation. This duration of antigen persistence would make human keratinocytes susceptible to cell destruction by immune response to FBS and may contribute to delayed loss of human keratinocyte grafts.\r"

They were insufflated with either 48 breaths of cotton smoke (n = 8) or air (n = 5) while they were deeply anesthetized with halothane. After injury, anesthesia was discontinued and the animals were mechanically ventilated throughout the experimental period (24 hours). Bronchial blood flow increased significantly at all time points recorded and reached its peak 20 minutes after the inhalation trauma (11 +/- 1 ml/hr to 106 +/- 18 ml/hr; p less than 0.05). Thereafter, bronchial blood flow decreased to a value that was six to eight times above the baseline measurement for the remainder of the study period. With these changes in blood flow, there was a concomitant increase in lung lymph flow. This variable gradually increased and was 633% of the baseline value (6 +/- 1 ml/hr to 44 +/- 8 ml/hr) 24 hours after the challenge with smoke. The control animals showed little or no change in cardiopulmonary function during the experimental period. There is no correlation between the increase in bronchial blood flow and lung lymph flow patterns after cotton smoke inhalation injury.\r"

After the application of 1-ampere currents at 60 Hz, animals were monitored from 1 to 4 days. Muscle impendance was measured with frequency sweeping to determine tissue destruction. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (phosphorus 31) was used to assess metabolic activity, and results were compared to impedance measurements. In burned limbs, 70% reduction in muscle impedance was seen, which corresponds to decreased metabolic activity (absent organic phosphates) and suggests necrosis. Visually viable tissue had impedance decreases of 25% and levels of organic phosphates slightly lower than normal. Relaxation frequencies in dogs with severe burns exceeded 80 kHz; in viable tissue, 30 to 40 kHz (normal: 30 kHz). In ischemic muscle, organic phosphates decreased rapidly (1 to 2 hours); impedance changes evolved more slowly (1 day), but they ultimately reached the same degree of severity. Measurement of impedance may be a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of electrical burns, since significant changes strongly suggest nonviability.\r"

Albumin is highly contaminated with aluminum, which is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Patients with burns receive large quantities of albumin and have impaired renal function, which puts them at hypothetical risk for aluminum loading. To assess the risk of aluminum loading we analyzed sera from 12 patients with burns for aluminum concentrations. Serum aluminum concentration was elevated in 8 of the 12 patients, and levels were at or near toxicity in 3 of the 8. Serum aluminum and serum creatinine levels directly correlated, r = 0.71 and p less than 0.005. No relation was found between serum aluminum and amount of albumin received. However, patients with the highest serum aluminum levels were the most severely burned and none survived. Thus patients with burns who are receiving albumin are at risk for aluminum loading. Impaired renal function contributes to aluminum retention.\r"

The animals were implanted with instruments for crystallographic dimension analysis of the left ventricle and measurement of left ventricular, aortic, left atrial, and pulmonary arterial pressures and cardiac index. Thirteen sheep received 1.0 micrograms/kg of Escherichia coli endotoxin with (n = 6) and without (n = 7) OKY-046 (10 mg/kg bolus, then 10 micrograms/kg/min). OKY-046 prevented the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and decrease in cardiac index usually seen during the early phase of endotoxemia. Between 8 and 12 hours after the administration of endotoxin, cardiac index increased from 6.4 +/- 0.8 to 8.4 +/- 0.8 L/min/m2. Concomitantly, the end-systolic pressure/diameter relationship (a sensitive myocardial contractility index) significantly decreased from 14.7 +/- 0.6 to 7.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg/mm. Another index of the left ventricular contractility, the maximum rate of pressure rise was also reduced. OKY-046 prevented decreases in end-systolic pressure/diameter relationship and maximum rate of pressure rise.\r"

Over a 10-year period from 1976 to 1985, of 1818 patients hospitalized for burns, 85 (4.7%) injuries were due to hot grease or oil. The mean age was 20 years; 34% of patients were less than 8 years old. The mean total body surface areas of second- and third-degree burns was 11.5% (range 0.5% to 40%), and the average length of hospital stay was 19.6 days. Fifty-eight percent of patients required split-thickness skin grafting (n = 49), three required intubation, and one required tracheostomy. Seventy-eight percent of oil burns occurred in the home. The most common circumstances consisted of children who grabbed the handle or electric cord of a frying pan and pulled the hot oil down onto themselves. (Nineteen of the 29 children were less than 8 years old (66%).) Burns due to cooking oil and grease are associated with considerable morbidity. The high boiling point, high viscosity, and potential combustibility of oil increase the potential soft-tissue damage when compared with typical scald injuries from hot water. The dangers of children pulling on the appliance, the dangers of transporting hot oil, the importance of supervision while children are cooking, and the importance of knowledge of the management of grease fires is stressed. Public education is needed to underline the potential seriousness of these burns.\r"

We surveyed pediatricians, well-baby clinics, and pediatric nurse practitioners in our area and found that approximately half of them advised the use of hair dryers to treat or prevent diaper rash. We tested four widely available hand-held hair dryers to determine potential for inflicting burn injury. All of the dryers are capable of delivering air heated to at least 53 degrees C after 2 minutes of use.

Children (0 to 4 years of age) continue to be the largest percentage of the 0- to 18-year-old age group who sustain burn injuries, and 67% of those injuries are sustained by children under the age of 5. Males accounted for 69% of the total burn population; 58% of admissions were white; 69% of patients were admitted for partial-thickness burns, and 31% were admitted for full-thickness burns; the largest primary payer was third-party payers; and 92% of patients with burns were discharged to home or self-care. Data were also analyzed by examination of selected age groups to determine individual needs of specific groups. An analysis of burn injuries reported to the National Burn Victim Foundation confirmed previous reports that the home is the most likely place for a burn injury to occur and that flame and scald injuries predominate; scald injuries comprise 50% of all sustained burns. Gasoline vapors accounted for 54% of burn injuries caused by flames. The data supported efforts to develop programs that address the needs of the urban child, the 17- to 19-year-old age groups, and the elderly.

Phase I, the first period of surveillance, demonstrated a unit-acquired colonization rate of 63%, with the marker organisms appearing at 4 to 8 days. Direct observation of isolation technique showed a 51% error rate. A mandatory educational session reviewing the high colonization rates, observed breaks in isolation technique, and principles of infection control failed to decrease the colonization rates as measured in phase II. A simplified isolation technique was adopted, which led to a decrease in unit-acquired colonization, from 63% to 33% in phase III from phase I values (p = 0.0514); and to a significant delay in inception, from 7.8 to 21 days, in those colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.05). The simplified isolation technique decreased isolation costs over a 6-month period from $53,000 to $30,000. To confirm the decrease colonization rates from phase I to phase III, a fourth 2-month surveillance period was undertaken 6 months later. Phase IV demonstrated similar results to those of phase III.\r"

Although the chimpanzee showed no signs of disease, it lost both CD4+ (as low as 134 cells/microliter) and CD8+ lymphocytes approximately 30 months after initial infection, followed by thrombocytopenia that has persisted for greater than 2 years. Lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia were preceded by or coincided with the appearance of antibodies cross-reactive with histone H2B and decreased levels of complement component C4; an eightfold decrease in HIV-specific antibody titers; the inability of CD8+ lymphocytes to suppress virus replication; impaired proliferative responses to T cell mitogens; and the isolation of cell-free HIV from plasma.

Six subjects received rgp160 and three subjects each received recombinant hepatitis B vaccine or placebo at 0, 1, and 6 months. rgp160 and a control preparation, baculovirus-expressed recombinant HIV-1 p24, were used as in vitro antigens. At day 56, all rgp160 recipients had stimulation indexes (rgp160/rp24) greater than 3.0, and five of six had differences in counts per minute (cpm) greater than 1000. Stimulation indexes were less than 2.0 and cpm differences were less than 150 in all six who did not receive rgp160. Lymphocyte proliferative responses were first noted 2 weeks to 5 months before initial Western blot reactivity and persisted for greater than or equal to 540 days, even among subjects who lost detectable antibody. Thus, the HIV-1 rgp160 vaccine induces persistent cellular immune recognition as demonstrated by lymphocyte proliferation.\r"

Among 134 unvaccinated HIV-1-negative men, 7% became HBV carriers, 64% had viremia, and 42% had clinical illness. Among vaccinated HIV-1-negative men, HBV infection severity decreased with number of vaccine doses administered. When adjusted for prior hepatitis B vaccination status, persons with HIV-1 infection preceding HBV infection had a significantly higher risk of developing HBV carriage, viremia, prolonged ALT elevation, and clinical illness. Among HIV-1-infected men, the risk of HBV carriage was increased in unvaccinated persons (21%) and those who failed to respond to vaccination (31%) and further increased in those who received vaccine doses at the time they developed new HBV infection (56%-80%), suggesting inactivated hepatitis B vaccine may temporarily impair the immune response to HBV infection in HIV-1-infected persons. HIV-1 infection was also associated with reduced alanine aminotransferase elevations during the first 36 months of follow-up of men who became HBV carriers.\r"

The group typing of antigens in 608 RSV-positive nasopharyngeal aspirates showed a regular alternation of group prevalence, following the cyclic occurrence of the virus. Group A predominated in 73%-90% of specimens from 1981-1982, 1985-1986, and 1989-1990, whereas group B predominated in 70%-100% of specimens from 1983-1984 and 1987-1988. The epidemiologic occurrence of verified reinfections in hospitalized children and the group typing results indicated that children greater than 6 months of age during the first infection were more resistant to severe reinfection with the homologous than with the heterologous group of virus. The study shows that group antigenic variation of RSV has a significant effect on the epidemiology of the virus.\r"

Calves were inoculated with a low-passage field isolate of BRSV for 4 consecutive days by a combined respiratory tract route and were euthanized 6 days after receiving the last inoculation. Arterial oxygen tension (Pao2) decreased significantly over time in colostrum-deprived, BRSV-inoculated calves (P less than .01) and was significantly different among treatment groups (P less than .05). A significant decrease in arterial oxygen saturation was observed in this same group over time (P less than .01). Mean percentage of pneumonic lung volume (determined by computer data digitalization) was significantly greater in infected, colostrum-deprived calves compared with the other groups (P less than .01), and BRSV antigen was detected in these calves by avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase staining. Thus, passive immunity derived from colostrum feeding decreased the severity of BRSV infections in calves.\r"

When rats were challenged 1 month after vaccination, severe pulmonary inflammation characterized by both a mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell infiltrate and 30%-40% involvement of lung tissue was observed with a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine. The FG glycoprotein induced minimal lung inflammation (involving 2%-5% of the lung), while negative controls had 1%-3% lung involvement. Two doses with as little as 20 ng of FG glycoprotein formulated in an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant completely protected the cotton rats from RSV challenge.

The normal isoform of hamster and human scrapie amyloid precursor protein was found on the microsomal/synaptosomal membranes anchored solely by the C-terminal glycolipid. Glycolipid cleavage resulted in dissociation from the membranes and change of behavior from a highly hydrophobic to a hydrophilic protein, susceptible to proteases. In contrast, the PrPSc/CJD isoform was resistant to release by glycolipid-cleaving enzymes. A part of PrPSc/CJD was released from the membranes after prolonged trypsin treatment, yielding a further protease-resistant product of 27-30 kDa. The results demonstrate the proteolytic resistance of the membrane-bound PrPSc/CJD isoform and also indicate the presence of a different, apparently disease-induced mechanism of membrane interaction in the scrapie- and CJD-infected microsomal and synaptosomal membranes.\r"

Several enteropathogens were isolated from stools of 34 of 58 cases, although none was significantly associated with diarrhea. For the 24 cases from which no enteropathogens were isolated, diffuse-adhering Escherichia coli (DAEC) strains were significantly associated with diarrheal disease (P less than .02; odds ratio = 6; 95% confidence limit, 1.08-99.0). DAEC were highly heterogeneous with respect to plasmid content and serotype. Three DNA probes designed to differentiate E. coli exhibiting localized, diffuse, or aggregative adherence were compared with results from a standard HeLa cell binding assay to assess the utility of these probes in the field. This study provides evidence for the potential pathogenic capacity of DAEC and underscores the variety of diarrheal agents operating within a community.\r"

The peptide reacted with a panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to whole TSST-1 in solid-phase immunoassays. TSST-1(58-78) promoted the in vitro proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in a dose-dependent manner. Minimum dose required for stimulation (P less than or equal to .05 microM) was 0.75 microM peptide. This mitogenic effect was abrogated by incubation of the peptide with MAbs to whole TSST-1 before addition to PBMC. The ability of TSST-1(58-78) to stimulate the proliferation of highly purified resting human T cells was analyzed. Significant proliferation (P less than or equal to .01) was observed only in the presence of increasing populations of monocytes added to the cultures. Adherent human monocytes exposed to TSST-1(58-78) released tumor necrosis factor. Thus, some of the immunoregulatory properties attributed to TSST-1 are demonstrated by the region of the toxin represented by the peptide TSST-1(58-78).\r"

Scanning electron microscopy revealed an increased quantity of mucus in infected preparations; H. influenzae were associated with mucus by 14 h of incubation and with damaged epithelial cells by 24 h. Fimbriation of H. influenzae increased buccal cell adherence but did not facilitate association with normal respiratory epithelium and failed to increase epithelial damage or association with damaged cells. Epithelial damage may be prerequisite for association of H. influenzae with respiratory epithelium in vitro.\r"

Changes in antibody responses to filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and to pertussis toxin (PT) were similar in pattern, and antibody titers reached values equal to those from patients with convalescent-stage pertussis. The FHA-induced DNA synthesis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was maximum at 4 weeks after the primary series, and these levels were equal to those of patients with pertussis. High amounts of PT-induced DNA synthesis were observed in both immunized and nonimmunized children; thus, PT seemed to act mainly as a nonspecific mitogen. Almost the same responses to several mitogens that activate different subsets of lymphocytes were observed in young infants compared with older children. Furthermore, young infants who had Bordetella pertussis infection responded by FHA stimulation almost as well as older children.\r"

Bacterial phagocytosis and bactericidal activity were significantly enhanced by approximately 50%-70% after preincubation of normal PMNL with G-CSF in concentrations of 1000-4000 units/ml for 10 min at 37 degrees C. G-CSF in similar concentrations enhanced the defective bactericidal activity of PMNL from HIV-1-infected patients by approximately 70%-150% and reached the baseline control PMNL killing. However, G-CSF enhanced neither phagocytosis nor fungicidal activity of normal PMNL against C. albicans blastoconidia. These data demonstrate that G-CSF enhances the antibacterial but not the antifungal activities of human PMNL in vitro and also improves the defective PMNL bactericidal activity of HIV-1-infected patients.\r"

In mice myelosuppressed by cyclophosphamide, subcutaneously administered rmGM-CSF was a potent stimulus of granulopoiesis by increasing the number of GM-CSF-responsive precursor cells in bone marrow followed by a profound neutrophilia. Neutrophil recovery was augmented by rmGM-CSF in a dose-dependent manner at daily doses of 0.6-5.0 micrograms/mouse. In addition, rmGM-CSF increased the functional activity of circulating neutrophils at similar doses. When rmGM-CSF was administered to neutropenic mice before experimentally induced Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Candida albicans infections, it protected against these lethal infections, resulting in increased numbers of survivors. These data suggest that rmGM-CSF protects neutropenic mice from lethal infections, probably by augmenting neutrophil recovery after myelosuppression and activation of mature cells.\r"

Ethanol inhibited PMNL aggregation induced by formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (FMLP) but not by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), whereas responses to both stimuli were abolished by treating PMNL with monoclonal antibody 60.3 (against the adhesion protein CD18). This antibody also abrogated spontaneous and FMLP-stimulated PMNL adhesion to plastic, whereas ethanol reduced spontaneous but not FMLP-induced adherence. Chemotaxis in Boyden or agarose systems was not diminished by ethanol, but high concentrations of MAb 60.3 inhibited migration under agarose. Nonetheless, upregulation of cell surface expression of CD18 (assessed by immunofluorescence flow cytometry) induced by FMLP or PMA was similarly reduced by ethanol. Thus, ethanol inhibited only certain of PMNL adhesion, and although the stimulated up-regulation of CD18 expression was reduced it is unlikely that ethanol effects were mediated only by this inhibition.\r"

Most infections (76%) involved skin, soft tissue, or bone and occurred after metal puncture wounds or open fractures. Isolates differed from biovar fortuitum in resistance to pipemidic acid and use of mannitol and inositol as carbon sources. Two subgroups were present, and examples were deposited in the American Type Culture Collection. Isolates were resistant to doxycycline and one-third were resistant to cefoxitin. All were susceptible to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, and imipenem. Surgical debridement combined with drug therapy based on in vitro susceptibilities resulted in cures of cutaneous disease or osteomyelitis.

Soluble fibronectin, RGD, GRGESP, and GRGDTP also inhibited fungal adherence to the individual immobilized ECM proteins in a complex pattern, but only soluble fibronectin (10(-7) M) inhibited fungal adherence to subendothelial ECM. Thus, C. albicans possesses at least one type of cell surface receptor for binding soluble fibronectin that can be inhibited with peptides. This receptor apparently is used to bind the fungus to immobilized ECM proteins and to subendothelial ECM and may play a role in the initiation of disseminated disease by bloodborne fungi by providing for adherence of the microorganisms to ECM proteins.\r"

The spores averaged 1 x 1.5-2.0 microns, had six to eight polar filament coils, displayed monokaryotic nuclei, and possessed relatively thick endospores with irregularly shaped exospores. Organisms developed within a parasitophorous vacuole. By SDS-PAGE analysis, the three isolates appeared to be identical but were different from E. cuniculi. Identical banding patterns on Western blots of the three isolates were expressed by each patient's serum. By Western immunoblotting, murine antisera to E. cuniculi reacted to several antigens of the new AIDS-related microsporidian, whereas murine antisera bound weakly to Nosema corneum. The name Encephalitozoon hellem (n. sp.) is proposed to identify this new human microsporidian.\r"

To test this possibility, the SCID-hu mouse (the immunodeficient C.B-17 scid/scid mouse engrafted with human hematolymphoid organs) was treated with AZT at different times after intravenous infection with a standard dose of HIV (known to infect 100% of animals). If given within 2 h, AZT suppressed infection in all animals; if given after 2 days, no suppression was observed. At least in some animals, an AZT-sensitive phase lasted for as long as 36 h. These data support the hypothesis that prompt administration of AZT might be efficacious in suppressing acute HIV infection in humans. Further studies in the SCID-hu mouse might provide insight into treatment protocols of even greater efficacy.\r"

Cloxacillin was significantly less effective for treating the tolerant than for the nontolerant strains. The addition of gentamicin to cloxacillin reduced bacterial numbers in endocardial vegetations for the tolerant strain comparable to the reduction by cloxacillin alone for the nontolerant strains, but had no additional effect for the nontolerant strains. Isolates from animals infected with the tolerant or nontolerant strains during antibiotic treatment remained tolerant or nontolerant.

The sensitivity of the assay varied with the type of leprosy from 92% for lepromatous leprosy to 56% for borderline lepromatous and 18% for borderline tuberculoid patients. After the onset of chemotherapy in lepromatous leprosy patients, there was often a transient increase of urinary PGL-1, followed by a steady decline. Within 3 months of multiple drug therapy, urinary PGL-1 levels were reduced by 90%-99% and were often undetectable. This assay appears to have considerable potential for monitoring chemotherapy and detecting treatment failure and relapse in patients with Hansen's disease.\r"

After Lewis strain rats were injected intraperitoneally with live B. burgdorferi or in the footpad with dead borreliae incorporated in complete Freund's adjuvant, they produced high-titered antisera. At a dilution of less than or equal to 1:10, sera from immunized or infected rats but not control sera inhibited growth of B. burgdorferi in vitro. Neutralization of growth of three different strains of B. burgdorferi by posttreatment sera was dose-dependent and was detected equally well by direct microscopic counts or by measuring incorporation of tritiated adenine into newly synthesized nucleic acids. These findings provide direct evidence that infection or immunization with the Lyme disease spirochete induces the formation of serum factors capable of preventing the growth of B. burgdorferi in vitro.\r"

Of 4841 stool specimens from patients with gastroenteritis examined between November 1989 and January 1990, Y. enterocolitica, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Salmonella were identified in 38, 49, 60, and 98 specimens, respectively; 34 (92%) of 37 Y. enterocolitica isolates were serotype O:3. Of the 38 patients with yersiniosis, 37 (97%) were children. Illnesses were clustered around the holidays, and 20 (62%) of 32 patients had been exposed to raw pork intestines in the 2 weeks before onset. Exposure was significantly associated with illness in a case-control study of eight patients identified at one hospital (P = .004). Infants less than or equal to 6 months old with yersiniosis were more likely to have immature-to-total neutrophil ratios greater than 0.50 than were infants of comparable age with salmonellosis (P = .02). Infrequently isolated in the past, Y. enterocolitica O:3 is emerging as an important enteric pathogen in this country, particularly among black children.\r"

Transient peritoneal contamination with bacteria after either intentional or unintentional violation of the gut are common. The effect of this intermittent antigen exposure upon later formation of intraabdominal abscesses is unclear. Previous experiments by others have demonstrated that repeated exposure to Bacteroides fragilis capsular polysaccharide can induce a T lymphocyte-mediated immunity to subsequent induction of pure B. fragilis abscess formation. In a murine mixed intraabdominal abscess model, preexposure to live Escherichia coli, B. fragilis, or both increased the number of later abscesses and in some cases their bacterial composition. Further, immunization with E. coli alone increased late mortality without altering overall mortality. These data suggest that the alterations of immune function produced by live, transient bacteria upon subsequent mixed intraabdominal abscess induction result in fundamentally different consequences from those observed after specific polysaccharide antigen exposure and subsequent monomicrobial abscess induction.\r"

An epidemiologic investigation suggested that the use of nebulizers to deliver medication was associated with acquiring legionnaires' disease. The hospital potable water system was contaminated with Lp3, and a survey indicated that tap water was commonly used to wash medication nebulizers. Lp3 in respirable-size droplets was isolated from aerosols generated by a nebulizer containing Lp3 at one-tenth the concentration found in the hospital potable water. These findings support the recommendation that only sterile fluids be used for filling or cleaning respiratory care equipment and suggest that this guideline is not universally followed.\r"

Recent comparisons of RNA sequence homologies between P. carinii and several genera of fungi and protozoa suggest that P. carinii has closer affinities with the ascomycetes than with the protozoa. The translatory systems of the fungi, however, require three soluble protein factors for peptide chain elongation rather than the two necessary in other eukaryotic systems; to date the additional protein elongation factor (EF-3) appears to be unique to fungi. Western blot analysis of cell-free extracts of P. carinii, derived from rat, was done using a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits to Saccharomyces cerevisiae EF-3. Anti-EF-3 cross-reacting material was detected only in lysates of Candida albicans and S. cerevisiae included as fungal controls; no cross reaction was detected in lysates of P. carinii, P. carinii-infected rat lung, or a protozoan control (Trichomonas vaginalis).\r"

Thirteen patients had acute viral hepatitis, and eleven patients had cholestatic jaundice due to carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Twenty healthy volunteers who served as controls were also included. In hepatitis patients, the mean plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-phospholipid/phospholipid (HDLPL/PL) ratio were reduced, and HDL-cholesterol (HDLC), HDL-phospholipid (HDLPL) and the phospholipid/total cholesterol (PL/TC) ratio were normal, while total phospholipid (PL) levels and the HDLC/TC ratio were significantly increased compared to the control values. In patients with cholestatic jaundice the mean plasma total cholesterol, phospholipid and HDLC levels were elevated, and HDLPL/PL, HDLPL, HDLC/TC and PL/TC remained normal compared to the control values. A comparison within the patient groups showed that plasma TC, PL and HDLC levels were significantly increased in cholestatic jaundice when compared with the corresponding levels in hepatitis patients. The mean plasma levels of HDLPL, HDLC/TC and PL/TC did not show any significant variation within the patient groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) correlated positively with TC, and total protein correlated negatively with TC and HDLPL, while albumin correlated negatively with TC, HDLC and HDLPL in cholestatic jaundice. Alanine amino-transferase (ALAT) also correlated positively with PL in cholestatic jaundice, while albumin correlated positively with TC in hepatitis. The results suggest that lipoproteins might be metabolized differently in these two forms of cholestasis.\r"

The mean age of subjects was 55.4 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.3 kg m-2. Among the obese snorers (n = 82), apnoeas had been observed 'occasionally', 'often', or 'habitually' in 49 cases. Death was classified as cardiovascular in 186 (40.4%) cases. Cardiovascular cause of death was more common among those who snored habitually or often than among those who snored occasionally or never (P less than 0.05). 'Habitual' snorers died more often while sleeping (P less than 0.05). Habitual snoring was found to be a risk factor for morning death (P less than 0.01). The possibility of obstructive sleep apnoea as a cause of sudden death should at least be considered if the decreased is known to have been a habitual snorer.\r"
