  ".W": "The development of specific inhibitors of bone resorption has revolutionized the treatment of Paget's disease. The diphosphonates, the calcitonins, and mithramycin are capable of inducing marked suppression of disease activity for prolonged periods as judged by biochemical, kinetic, and histologic techniques. Whereas the effects of the calcitonins and mithramycin persist only for the duration of treatment, diphosphonate treatment consistently results in a reduction of disease activity for many months or even years after stopping treatment. The question arises whether the long-term control of the disease activity confers significant clinical advantages to the patient. Relief of bone pain, spinal neurologic syndromes, immobilization hypercalcemia, and high-output cardiac failure are related to the degree of biochemical control attained by treatment. New bone formed during treatment is lamellar and radiologic progression of disease is favorably modified. It is not yet known whether long-term treatment will decrease bone enlargement and deformity or reduce the risk of fracture.\r"

Sucking abnormalities usually present as absence of the sucking response, weakness or incoordination of sucking and swallowing, or some combination of these problems. More investigation of the responses of these infants to various stimuli and training techniques is greatly needed. Although training neurologically impaired infants to breastfeed may present a challenge to even the most experienced neonatal nurse, physician, or therapist, most infants improve and can learn to suckle at the breast. If a mother has intended to nurse her infant, she should be encouraged to do so, even when the infant has abnormalities of sucking, except in the rare and most severely affected infants who remain dependent on gavage or gastrostomy feedings. Various techniques of stimulating, positioning, and progressive weaning to the breast can be helpful in teaching mother and infant to breastfeed. Encouraging support should be provided by all professionals involved with the mother and infant, as well as by a team experienced in helping with such problems. Most importantly, mother and staff must be patient, because the rewards for both the infant and mother are worth the effort.\r"

  ".W": "Human milk is a highly complex fluid with a nutrient balance and an array of functional properties that may promote a level of metabolic efficiency that is not attainable when a cow milk-based formula is fed. This is not a novel idea. Mitchell in 1933 proposed that the level of efficiency of energy use is determined by the nutrient \"balance\" in the diet. Nonetheless, difficulties remain in the attempt to reconcile the low levels of intake with established estimates of energy needs. If the amount of energy that appears necessary for growth and maintenance of a 4-month-old infant is compared with that from his or her intake of an exclusive human milk diet, the infant should have little or no energy left for activity. Do metabolic economies contribute to more efficient uses of energy for growth and maintenance in breastfed infants? Are there differences in body composition? Does more efficient use of energy occur as a result of a decrease in clinical and subclinical infections? Is efficient energy utilization accomplished by significant curtailment in activity? If an excess level of energy is consumed by bottlefed infants, what are the positive or negative short-term or long-term consequences? These questions are the focus of research in numerous laboratories. Field and clinical studies of breastfed infants and in vitro studies of human milk offer unique opportunities to understand basic mechanisms of human adaptations to nutrient intake and environmental challenges.\r"

A review of the literature on the physiological effects of hypothermia in animals reveals that the \"physiological neutrality\" intracellularly is achieved at progressively higher pH values as temperature falls, and that this more alkaline acid-base balance is apparently achieved while the total carbon dioxide content of the tissues remains at normothermic (normal body temperature) levels. Based on this, an anesthetic technique was studied, whereby the ventilation was maintained throughout the cooling/surgery/rewarming cycle at normothermic levels. This allowed a progressively more alkaline acid-base environment to be achieved. This technique is discussed in detail, together with information relating to the circulatory changes and complications seen and the degree of acid-base control obtained. The conclusion is drawn that the addition of carbon dioxide to the ventilation gases, of alternatively, a decrease in ventilation as temperature falls, is not only unnecessary, but perhaps also harmful.\r"

  ".U": "87160336\r", 
  ".W": "As demonstrated by this discussion, jaundice in breastfeeding infants appears to be related both to feeding-related issues and to an as-yet unidentified factor in the human milk of a small minority of women. In the case of feeding-related factors, how a mother breastfeeds; that is, how often she offers the breast and how well the baby suckles, as well as how often and how much the baby is offered complementary or supplementary feedings of water, glucose solutions, or a nonhuman mammal milk, influence serum bilirubin concentrations in the first week of postnatal life. We call this breastfeeding-related jaundice, recognizing that the feeding process is a key element in the condition. We urge that management recommendations focus on the feeding process to reduce the level of serum bilirubin concentration in the first week of life. It is appropriate to note at this juncture that hyperbilirubinemia also occurs in bottlefed infants; the frequency of feeding of these infants also may play a role in the severity of jaundice. If research findings bear out such a relationship, we may see a corollary label of \"feeding-related\" jaundice also applied to bottlefed babies. In a very small percentage of breastfeeding infants, a second form of jaundice occurs. Its onset appears somewhat later in the postnatal period, and it is characterized by a higher peak and a slower decline in the level of serum bilirubin concentration. We call this breast milk jaundice, recognizing that it appears to stem from the milk the baby receives rather than the manner in which he or she is fed. Eliminating other causes of jaundice prior to considering even a brief interruption of breastfeeding is appropriate when caring for the infant with this syndrome. In the breastfeeding infant, both early- and late-onset jaundice appear to be related. We suggest this because the baby with breast-feeding jaundice may be more responsive to the factor in abnormal milk, which produces breast milk jaundice. The infant with breast-feeding jaundice has a larger bilirubin load at the time the abnormal milk is being ingested. The recycling of this increased load, because of exaggerated enterohepatic circulation, results in a further late rise in serum bilirubin. If the initial bilirubin pool is smaller, the effect of the abnormal milk might well be insignificant or at least markedly diminished.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In normotensive subjects exercise increased lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors by about 100%. This effect seems to be a beta 2-dependent process, since it is prevented by propranolol (5 mg administered intravenously) and the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 (25 mg t.i.d. orally for 2 weeks) but not by the beta 1-selective antagonist bisoprolol (2.5 mg administered intravenously). In patients with essential hypertension who have elevated lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors, dynamic exercise caused only marginal beta 2-adrenoceptor changes, suggesting an impairment of the acute beta-adrenoceptor regulation. Normalization of blood pressure by antihypertensive treatment resulted in a significant fall in lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors and in a restoration of exercise-induced beta 2-adrenoceptor increases. It is concluded that in essential hypertension the impairment of beta-adrenoceptor regulation is directly linked to the elevated blood pressure.\r"

Reports of large intrapatient variability of theophylline elimination rate and consequent clearance raise concerns regarding this assumption and also challenge the practice of assuming relative constancy of elimination rate in the performance of bioavailability studies of slow-release formulations. We therefore systematically studied under controlled conditions the elimination rate of theophylline in 10 patients over an extended time interval. The initial elimination rate constants ranged from 0.062 to 0.136 hours-1. The changes ranged from -5.9% to 9.4% of the initial value during intervals of 2 to 11 months. Correlation of the first and second values was 0.96. Thus the elimination rate of theophylline generally appears to vary little within individuals over time when studied under controlled conditions.\r"

The total body clearance was 1.3 L/kg/hr. At intravenous doses of 5 mg/kg or oral doses of 10 mg/kg, plasma levels were continuously maintained above the target level of 1 mumol/L. Oral bioavailability was 63% +/- 13%. Substantial penetration of N3TdR into cerebrospinal fluid was demonstrated. At doses of 5 mg/kg intravenously or 10 mg/kg orally, cerebrospinal fluid drug levels exceeded and were maintained close to 1 mumol/L. Nineteen percent of the administered dose was excreted unchanged into the urine. Renal clearance was 0.23 L/kg/hr. N3TdR possesses pharmacokinetic properties that would facilitate the long-term treatment of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: it can be given orally and it penetrates the central nervous system.\r"

Human plasmin caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in adenylate cyclase activity when added to a crude platelet membrane preparation. Both basal and prostaglandin E1-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity doubled in presence of plasmin. This stimulatory activity was shared by papain and alpha-chymotrypsin, but not by thrombin which displayed a slightly inhibitory effect. Plasmin not only stimulated platelet adenylate cyclase activity, but also suppressed the GTP-dependent alpha 2-adrenergic inhibition, thereby producing a five- to six-fold increased activity measured in the presence of adrenaline and GTP. These effects of plasmin on the adenylate cyclase system were suppressed by the addition of the protease inhibitor leupeptin, and of soybean trypsin inhibitor, indicating that proteolysis mediated these effects. We also examined the adenylate cyclase activity in membranes prepared from intact platelets incubated with increasing doses of plasmin. Incubation of platelets with plasmin concentrations as low as 0.25 mg/ml resulted in an irreversible increase in membrane adenylate cyclase activity and suppression of the adrenaline-mediated inhibition of enzyme activity. These results suggest that the proteolytic stimulating effect of plasmin on the platelet adenylate cyclase system may account for the inhibition of platelet aggregation.\r"

  ".W": "This article has presented information concerning the ultrastructural features and, to a lesser degree, the immunohistochemical characteristics of lung neoplasms. Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry are useful techniques for diagnosing and understanding common and rare lung tumors. Electron microscopy is particularly helpful in accurately diagnosing undifferentiated lung tumors such as large-cell undifferentiated and small-cell undifferentiated carcinomas. Ultrastructural studies of lung tumors have also aided in overall understanding of the histogenesis of these tumors. Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry are techniques that can be applied to tiny specimens, including those obtained via fine-needle aspiration biopsy, and to cells obtained from pleural fluid. An intelligent use of electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry aids in the diagnosis and understanding of lung neoplasms.\r"

  ".U": "87160397\r", 
  ".W": "Several articles have been published recently that discuss the role of electron microscopy in the diagnosis and study of gynecologic neoplasms. It becomes apparent from those works and the review just presented that, although an ultrastructural study is not necessary for reaching a diagnosis of many of these tumors, it may be necessary or supportive in identifying the more poorly differentiated ones. Furthermore, electron microscopy is valuable in providing evidence for the histogenesis of some of these neoplasms. Unfortunately for the pathologist, a certain level of morphologic differentiation (and an absence of metaplasia) in a cell is usually necessary for these goals to be achieved. For example, an adenomatoid tumor (see the article by Dr. Srigley, Mr. Toth, and Mr. Edwards in this issue) of the fallopian tube can readily be accepted as being composed of mesothelial cells, because both the neoplastic cells and normal mesothelial cells have the same highly differentiated features of long, slender microvilli, prominent intercellular junctions, and many microfilaments. On the other hand, there is very little resemblance between the granulosa cells of a granulosa-cell tumor and mature mesothelial cells. Thus, if one of the theories of histogenesis of granulosa cells were correct--namely, that they are derived ultimately from mesothelial lining--the ultrastructural evidence would rest on recognizing a similarity between the two types of cells at an earlier stage of differentiation. The neoplastic granulosa cell has differentiated along a separate, specialized line in which the ultrastructural resemblance to the parent cell is partly, if not completely, lost. Another example of the type of information that electron microscopy can provide is in relation to the common epithelial tumors. There is good evidence that the serous tumors in this group arise from mesothelium, although ultrastructurally their differentiation has veered from a mesothelial direction to one in which the cells have a complement of organelles related to secretory activity. Paradoxically, the mucinous cystic tumors, which have been classified traditionally as tumors of surface epithelial origin, are now thought to be of germ-cell origin in some cases, as examples of monophyletic teratomas. The ultrastructural evidence for this conclusion rests on the presence of anchoring filaments in the microvilli of the neoplastic cells, similar to those of normal intestinal epithelium, and on an admixture of various types of gastrointestinal cells, including those that contain dense-core granules (argentaffin cells).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Primary serosal neoplasms demonstrate a wide spectrum of growth patterns and biologic aggressiveness. The adenomatoid tumor is uniformly benign, whereas the diffuse malignant mesothelioma pursues a downhill clinical course, rapidly leading to fatality. The cystic peritoneal mesothelioma occupies an intermediate position characterized by persistent and/or recurrent disease but without progression to death. The distinction of an epithelial mesothelioma from metastatic adenocarcinoma remains a challenging problem. In the vast majority of cases, this can be accomplished by combining routine histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy. The absence of epithelial mucins and nonreactivity with antibodies to CEA strongly favor mesothelioma. Ultrastructurally observed long, thin, sinuous surface microvilli without a glycocalix, well-developed desmosomes, and abundant tonofilaments add further support for a primary serosal neoplasm. The sarcomatoid mesothelioma can easily be confused with a chest-wall sarcoma. Despite lacking ultrastructural evidence of \"epithelial\" differentiation, immunocytochemical studies demonstrate cytokeratin. This distinguishes the sarcomatoid mesothelioma from most soft-tissue sarcomas. There remains a small number of cases, particularly those in the \"poorly differentiated\" or \"transitional\" category, in which the distinction between mesothelioma and metastatic carcinoma remains difficult. In this situation, it is imperative that all the clinical information be closely reviewed and a diligent search for a primary site be carried out. There are many parallels between reactive and neoplastic serosal tissue. The desmoplastic/sarcomatoid mesothelioma morphologically and immunocytochemically resembles the reactive multipotential subserosal cell (MSC) of injured serosal tissue, whereas the adenomatoid tumor, cystic peritoneal mesothelioma, and epithelial mesothelioma resemble surface mesothelium. The poorly differentiated mesothelioma resembles a stage of maturation between the two extremes, and thus the term \"transitional\" mesothelioma is suggested. The localized fibrous tumor of the pleura is unique among all other serosal neoplasms in its failure to express cytokeratin. It more closely resembles the unspecialized connective tissue fibroblast of normal serosal tissue, and thus may be more analogous to a soft-tissue tumor than to the remaining mesothelial-derived neoplasms.\r"

In all cases, the application of these techniques has greatly increased our overall understanding of tumor structure, pathobiology, and classification.\r"

While heart disease in the elderly may be similar in many respects to that in younger patients, major age-related differences do exist with regard to etiology, pathogenesis, natural history, clinical presentation, and management. Optimal management of the older cardiac patient requires that these differences be taken into account. In prescribing a medical regimen, it is important to keep in mind that age-related decreases in renal function, hepatic perfusion, and drug metabolism may result in higher drug levels and that the elderly are also often more prone to adverse drug effects, especially central nervous system changes. One should remember that chronology is not necessarily synonymous with physiology, and much depends on the individual patient in terms of the lifestyle he/she led and that which he/she wishes to have. Advanced age may be associated with greater interventional morbidity and mortality, but age alone should not be a contraindication to aggressive medical or surgical therapy.\r"

In order to determine the optimal bronchodilator dose of bitolterol, six doses, (0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg, 2.5 mg and 3.0 mg), were administered by closed-port, intermittent-flow nebulization (CPIF) to asthmatic patients on different days. For most patients, the onset of bronchodilator activity (FEV1 increase of at least 15 percent above baseline) occurred within 5 minutes and lasted at least 8 hours. Maximum mean increases in FEV1 were 46-50 percent at the 1.0 mg to 3.0 mg doses. Beyond the 1.0 mg dose, there was no significant improvement in bronchodilator effect, but adverse effects, particularly tremor, increased at higher doses. The optimal dose of bitolterol administered by CPIF was determined to be 1.0 mg which is similar to the dose of bitolterol recommended for use by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) which is 0.7 mg to 1.1 mg. If continuous-flow nebulization is used, two-three times more drug may be needed for a comparable effect. Bitolterol appears to be a safe, effective and long-lasting bronchodilator when administered by jet nebulization.\r"

PAWP was then decreased to 10 mm Hg for two hours, and shunt, lung water (extravascular thermal volume, or ETV, by thermal dye), and perfusion distribution (radiomicrosphere technique) were measured and compared with four other dogs (group 1) whose PAWP was maintained at 10 mm Hg. The eight dogs with PAWP of 30 mm Hg for 1 1/2 hours were retrospectively subdivided into two groups of four based on ETV (group 2, double baseline ETV; group 3, triple baseline ETV). Baseline ETV and shunt were similar for all groups and remained unchanged for group 1. At 1 1/2 hours, 2 hours (1/2 hour after decreasing PAWP), 2 1/2 hours, and 3 1/2 hours, respectively, ETV were: 13.9 +/- 1.9, 12.8 +/- 2.0, 9.3 +/- 1.5, and 8.5 +/- 1.0 ml/kg in group 2; and 21.9 +/- 2.1, 22.7 +/- 2.2, 22.5 +/- 2.0, and 22.2 +/- 2.0 ml/kg in group 3. A more variable rate of edema formation was detected in eight additional dogs, but failure to resolve higher levels of edema after decreasing PAWP was also demonstrated in this group. Edema was greatest in lower lobes and decreased lobar perfusion. Shunt was higher in group 3 than in group 2 at 1 1/2 hours and decreased in group 2 but not in group 3 at 3 1/2 hours. Changes in colloid osmotic pressure may account for the differences in edema formation and resolution, but our data suggest that, independent of the rate of edema formation, a decrease in vascular exchange surface area at higher levels of edema may inhibit edema resolution when PAWP is decreased.\r"

At completion of the trial, a marked suppression of the adrenocortical function was found in seven of eight patients treated for nine attacks with BMT but not in any patients in the BDP group (P less than 0.01). The mean posttreatment basal and stimulated plasma cortisol levels in the BMT group were significantly lower as compared with the BDP group. The overall therapeutic response assessed by score systems was comparable in the two treatment groups. It is concluded that, in the topical treatment of ulcerative colitis, BDP is preferable to BMT because it exerts an equal anti-inflammatory action without affecting adrenocortical function.\r"

Echotomography is an important means for determining the extent of a tumor beyond the rectal wall, whereas lymphoscintigraphy is useful in demonstrating the metastatic locations in lymph nodes. These two modes of evaluation may permit an evaluation of the extent of the tumor and the possible involvement of regional lymph nodes before a surgical operation. Although the case material is limited, the statistical data can lead one to believe that, in the near future, a reasoned choice will be possible between local excision and abdominoperineal resection. The study includes 60 endorectal echotomographies and 26 lymphoscintigraphies (20 with 99mTc colloid and six with 201-Tl colloid).\r"

This review presents variables that should be considered when activated charcoal is used in the treatment of intoxicated patients. Variables that may alter the efficacy of charcoal therapy include the preparation and dose of charcoal used, the intoxicants involved, stomach contents, the gastrointestinal pH, concurrently administered materials, and time from toxin ingestion to charcoal administration. As a general guideline, a single, large dose should be administered with a cathartic as soon as possible after oral ingestion to prevent drug absorption. When charcoal is used to enhance systemic drug clearance, the dosage regimen should be individualized, based on the drugs involved and the patient's gastrointestinal tract function, fluid and electrolyte status, and the severity of intoxication.\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged exposure of isolated islets to glucose (11 mM) results in desensitization of insulin secretion. In this study, both glucose-regulated proinsulin biosynthesis and its processing during glucose-induced desensitization were examined at critical periods during 24 h. Although insulin secretion declined at 24 h to one third the 3 h maximum rate, the total rate of proinsulin biosynthesis, assessed by [3H]leucine incorporation, was unchanged at 0, 3, and 24 h of glucose (11 mM) exposure. Total insulin recovery measured by immunoreactive insulin in islets and media after 24 h was approximately 172% of the initial islet content. After correction for insulin degradation, and since proinsulin biosynthesis was unchanged, the synthesis rate was calculated to be a constant 3.5 +/- 1.1%/h of the initial islet content. Results suggest that desensitization may occur at the release mechanism rather than at a step in glucose metabolism common for the stimulation of synthesis and secretion. In contrast, the conversion rate of proinsulin to insulin progressively increased with prolonged prior glucose exposure, the major increase occurring by 3 h of glucose preincubation. Low glucose (2 mM), when used during the 3-h prelabeling period, did not affect the conversion rate. Furthermore, cycloheximide added during the 3-h preexposure to glucose (11 mM) completely prevented glucose-induced activation of the conversion process. These results indicate that the conversion rate of proinsulin to insulin is a glucose-regulated process requiring synthesis of a pool of either converting enzyme(s) or other regulating protein before initiation of proinsulin synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Using a monospecific, monoclonal antibody against the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), an immunocytochemical study was performed to investigate the intracellular localization of GR both in the presence or absence of ligand. With all fixation methods tested (paraformaldehyde, acetic acid in ethanol, Bouin's fixative, and bensochinone in PBS), it was possible to obtain specific GR staining. Fixation with paraformaldehyde was chosen for further studies on the effect of permeabilization, using several concentrations of Triton X-100 or saponin. A rat Rueber hepatoma (H-4-II-E) and a human uterus carcinoma (NHIK 3025) cell line were used as well as cultured hepatocytes from normal rat. The accessibility of the different cell compartments after fixation and permeabilization was tested for by using antibodies against cellular constituents with known locations (i.e. core-nucleosome proteins and tubulin), in combination with the anti-GR antibody in double immunofluorescence staining experiments. The specific GR stain obtained with the indirect peroxidase antiperoxidase technique or with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled second antibodies was shown to be present both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Staining of all cellular compartments was abolished (peroxidase antiperoxidase) or diminished (fluorescein isothiocyanate) if the monoclonal antibody was preincubated with a 90% pure GR preparation. These findings are in contrast to recently reported immunocytochemical studies, where a strict nuclear existence of the estrogen and progestin receptors has been reported. Consequently, generalizations with regard to steroid receptor localization cannot be made. Furthermore, an in vitro model is described, where the effect of dexamethasone administration upon the localization of receptor staining in H-4-II-E cells can be studied.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, we characterized the proteins associated with a purified lamellar body fraction isolated from human fetal lung explants. We then raised antibodies directed against the major human surfactant apoprotein, a 35-K glycoprotein, and used the technique of immunoblot analysis to evaluate the content of the surfactant apoprotein in human fetal lung explants maintained in serum-free medium in vitro. We found that the 35K surfactant apoprotein was undetectable in homogenates of fetal lung tissue before culture; the surfactant apoprotein was induced in the cultured explants coincident with the appearance of differentiated type II cells. Insulin, at concentrations as low as 2.5 ng/ml, caused marked inhibition of the accumulation of the 35K protein in the cultured fetal lung tissue. The inhibitory effect of insulin was dose dependent and was apparent as early as day 2 of incubation. When explants were cultured in medium containing insulin plus cortisol, the amount of immunoreactive surfactant apoprotein was reduced compared to that of explants cultured in control medium or explants cultured with cortisol alone. On the other hand, as reported previously, insulin and cortisol, in combination, stimulated phosphatidylcholine synthesis. These findings are indicative that the phospholipid and apoprotein components of surfactant are regulated independently. The results of our studies suggest that fetal hyperinsulinemia may cause the production of a surfactant deficient in the 35K apoprotein, and this may provide an explanation for the increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in infants of diabetic mothers.\r"

Changes in renal function induced by inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system have been the basis for the postulate that AII may act as a paracrine substance in the kidney. We studied the renal action of chronic intrarenal infusions of AII at doses between 2 and 2000 fmol/kg X min in uninephrectomized conscious dogs monitored on 80 meq daily sodium intake. Exogenous AII was confined to the kidney, as demonstrated by the absence of systemic pressor and adrenal cortical responses during the intrarenal infusion. After 2 control days, each dose of AII was infused intrarenally for a period of 3 days. The smallest intrarenal dose of AII that caused significant antinatriuresis and antidiuresis was 20 fmol/kg X min. A significant reduction in urinary volume and sodium excretion occurred during the first 24 h of the infusion period and was proportionate to the amount of peptide infused. Renal escape from the antinatriuretic and antidiuretic effects of the peptide ensued on the second and third days of infusion. There were no significant changes in urinary potassium excretion, plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration, or blood pressure throughout the period of intrarenal AII administration. These data demonstrate dose-dependent direct antinatriuretic and antidiuretic actions of low AII concentrations. Escape from the sodium-retaining action of intrarenal AII occurred by 48 h and was independent of suppression of endogenous renin-angiotensin. These results indicate that AII alters renal function by direct intrarenal mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "87161577\r", 
  ".W": "Glomerular angiotensin II receptors are reduced in number in early diabetes mellitus, which may contribute to hyperfiltration and glomerular injury. The time course and role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the pathogenesis of the receptor abnormality were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats made diabetic with streptozotocin (65 mg, iv). Glomerular angiotensin II receptors were measured by Scatchard analysis; insulin, renin activity, angiotensin II, and aldosterone were measured by RIA. Diabetes mellitus was documented at 24 h by a rise in plasma glucose (vehicle-injected control, 133 +/- 4; diabetic, 482 +/- 22 mg/dl; P less than 0.001) and a fall in plasma insulin (control, 53.1 +/- 5.7; diabetic, 35.6 +/- 4.0 microIU/ml; P less than 0.05). At 24 h glomerular angiotensin II receptor density was decreased by 26.5% in diabetic rats (control, 75.5 +/- 9.6 X 10(6); diabetic, 55.5 +/- 8.3 X 10(6) receptors/glomerulus; P less than 0.01). Receptor occupancy could not explain the defect, because there was reduced binding in diabetic glomeruli after pretreatment with 3 M MgCl2, a maneuver that caused dissociation of previously bound hormone. There was a progressive return of the receptor density toward normal over the 60 days following induction of diabetes, with diabetic glomeruli measuring 22.7%, 14.8%, and 3.7% fewer receptors than age-matched controls at 11 days, 1 month, and 2 months, respectively (r = 0.99; n = 4; P less than 0.01). Three lines of evidence suggested that reduced angiotensin II receptor density at 24 h was not due to down-regulation by angiotensin II: PRA and angiotensin II were identical in control and diabetic rats; angiotensin II infusion (50 ng/min) caused down-regulation in both control and diabetic rats, but the change in receptor density persisted (control, 33.6 +/- 6.9 X 10(6); diabetic, 18.5 +/- 1.3 X 10(6) receptors/glomerulus; P less than 0.05); and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril caused receptor up-regulation, but the differences persisted (control, 105.5 +/- 21.2 X 10(6); diabetic, 67.1 +/- 3.0 X 10(6) receptors/glomerulus; P less than 0.05). Rats with chronic diabetes (7-60 days) had normal PRA and angiotensin II, but plasma aldosterone was elevated (control, 29.8 +/- 3.3; diabetic, 68.6 +/- 12.4 ng/dl; P less than 0.005). The return of angiotensin II receptor density to normal levels in chronic diabetes may be the result of receptor up-regulation by increased plasma aldosterone rather than recovery of the underlying defect.\r"

  ".W": "The activity of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAM-DC) has been measured in the adrenal gland of rats given treatments that are known to result in increased activity of ornithine decarboxylase in this organ. In contrast to the effects of the dopamine agonists piribedil and apomorphine on the latter enzyme, the administration of these drugs caused decreases of SAM-DC in both parts of the gland. After piribedil the activity decreased rapidly to a minimum at 2-4 h, with recovery by 6 h. The stress of immobilization or the administration of insulin or 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) also decreased adrenal SAM-DC activity. The results contrast with those observed in other rat tissues where SAM-DC is generally induced by treatments that induce ornithine decarboxylase. Denervation of the adrenal gland did not clearly affect the reduction in adrenomedullary SAM-DC after 2-DG. Hypophysectomy resulted in reduced SAM-DC activity in both adrenal medulla and cortex; the activity could be restored by giving the animals 2 IU ACTH daily for 4 days. These changes in activity were parallelled by changes in immunoreactive protein. 2-DG did not decrease SAM-DC in hypophysectomized rats receiving maintenance ACTH dosage. This indicates the presence of hormonal control over the activity of SAM-DC in the adrenal medulla and cortex. Acute administration of an additional 10 IU ACTH to hypophysectomized rats on maintenance dosage of ACTH resulted in decreased SAM-DC activity in both adrenal medulla and cortex. These decreases were not abolished by inhibition of corticosteroid synthesis with metopirone. PRL and GH had no significant effect on adrenal SAM-DC activity of hypophysectomized rats. The reduction of SAM-DC activity in both parts of the gland of hypophysectomized rats with administration of (Bu)2cAMP suggests that cAMP may mediate the decreases in SAM-DC caused by the above treatments.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in immunostaining, median eminence content, and secretion into the hypophysial-portal circulation of immunoreactive CRF (irCRF), arginine vasopressin (irAVP), and oxytocin (irOT) were directly evaluated after pharmacological adrenalectomy (PHADX). Mean circulating levels of ACTH rose from 270 +/- 57 (+/- SE) to 1560 +/- 283 pg/ml after 72 h of treatment with metyrapone and aminoglutethimide. Initially, hypophysial-portal plasma irCRF levels decreased to 52.6% (12 h) and 21.7% (24 h) of control levels (230 +/- 41 pg/ml). Accompanying changes in the patterns of CRF immunostaining in the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) or in median eminence irCRF content at 24 h did not parallel alterations in portal plasma irCRF levels at this time. By 72 h posttreatment, portal irCRF levels were elevated 2.2-fold, while the number of detectable CRF-positive perikarya in the PVN increased 3.0-fold. The mean hypophysial-portal plasma irAVP concentration was unchanged from the control value (1312 +/- 287 pg/ml) at 12 h, but was only 34.9% of the control value at 24 h. Inverse changes in median eminence irAVP content were noted at these times, whereas the number of AVP-immunostained cells exhibited a tendency toward an increase at 24 h, in parallel with significantly increased content. By 72 h post-PHADX, portal irAVP, median eminence irAVP content, irAVP immunostaining intensity, and AVP-immunopositive cell number were elevated. Approximately 64% of CRF-positive perikarya in the parvocellular PVN costained for AVP at this time, whereas no colocalization was evident in untreated rats. These changes were prevented by corticosterone replacement. irOT staining intensity, irOT-positive cell number, median eminence irOT content, and portal plasma irOT concentration remained stable at all times examined. We conclude that: removal of adrenal steroids by PHADX results in a sequence of changes in CRF and AVP within the PVN (as determined by immunocytochemistry) and the median eminence (as determined by peptide content) similar to those observed after surgical adrenalectomy; after steroid removal the secretion of both irCRF and irAVP changes in a biphasic manner characterized by reduced secretion at 24 h and greatly enhanced secretion at 72 h; neither immunostaining nor median eminence content alone proved to be a reliable index or secretory activity during the initial phases of steroid blockade; and the hypophysiotropic OT system of normal male rats appears to be insensitive to adrenal steroid influences.\r"

The first was an indirect enzymatic assay which measures the amount of angiotensin I liberated from plasma by an excess of renin. The second was a direct RIA that measures both angiotensinogen and its inactive residue the des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen. The difference between the methods represents the circulating levels of des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen. Captopril administration in sodium-depleted rats increased plasma concentrations of renin, des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen, and angiotensin I and decreased plasma angiotensinogen concentration measured by both methods. Plasma des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen was significantly correlated to plasma renin concentration, which suggests an increase in the consumption of angiotensinogen when the renin secretion is extremely increased. The angiotensinogen liver content and in vitro angiotensinogen release were decreased in sodium-depleted rats treated with a converting enzyme inhibitor, and these parameters were negatively correlated to in vivo plasma levels of renin, angiotensin I, and des-angiotensin I-angiotensinogen. They were positively correlated to plasma angiotensinogen concentration measured by the indirect assay. These data suggest that captopril administration during sodium depletion has two simultaneous effects: it increases angiotensinogen consumption and second, decreases angiotensinogen production and release.\r"

I-CRF was detected in plasma from normal rats (mean +/- SD, 5.6 +/- 0.9 pg/ml; n = 6). Gel filtration chromatography of I-CRF from pooled plasma of these rats revealed a single peak which eluted in the position of authentic rat CRF. I-CRF levels in ME and I-ACTH levels in anterior pituitary decreased immediately after adrenalectomy, then gradually increased to high levels 14 days after surgery. Plasma I-CRF and I-ACTH concentrations increased immediately after surgery, slightly decreased to near the control levels at 24 h, and then increased to high concentrations 14 days after surgery. Plasma and ME I-CRF levels 14 days after adrenalectomy, followed by daily dexamethasone replacement, were almost the same as control levels. In insulin-induced hypoglycemia, plasma I-ACTH and I-CRF concentrations increased and ME I-CRF content decreased at 30 and 60 min.

We examined the potential role of the liver in neurotensin clearance using the isolated perfused rat liver model. With N-terminal and C-terminal directed RIAs and HPLC, we demonstrated rapid metabolism of intact neurotensin to inactive N-terminal fragments in the isolated rat liver system. The disappearance half-lives of C-terminal and N-terminal immunoreactivity were 20.4 +/- 6.0 min and 82.7 +/- 7.7 min, respectively, (P less than 0.002). To assess whether this neurotensin disappearance might be due to metabolism within the perfusate itself by a peptidase released from liver, we further incubated neurotensin in perfusate previously circulated through liver. A rapid and progressive breakdown of intact neurotensin to N-terminal fragments was again shown. These data demonstrate that a substantial proportion of the hepatic clearance of neurotensin is attributable to release of a peptidase by the liver into the circulation.\r"

The effects of insulin and IGF-I are not additive in these instances. For the induction of basal carrier-mediated glucose transport, the insulin ED50 is 8 ng/ml, and that for IGF-I is 16 ng/ml. Either factor can induce transport activity up to the level present in the cells from 2-day lactating mice. In this instance the effects are additive; insulin and IGF-I together can induce the transport up to the 10-day lactating level.\r"

The IGF-I and IGF-II degrading activities of the kidney membrane were also found to be specific for the respective hormones. Comparison of the binding and degrading kinetics suggested the two systems to be separate. The characterization of the degrading activities revealed the activities to be neutral sulfhydryl proteases which are different from insulin neutral protease. Identity of these proteases as separate from the insulin protease was revealed from the specificity of the degrading enzymes for IGF and the differential inhibitory effect of N-ethylmaleimide on the enzymes compared to insulin protease. In summary, the IGF binding and degrading activities of kidney membrane are two independent systems with specificity for IGF-I or IGF-II, respectively. Additionally, the characterized IGF-degrading systems revealed the enzymes to be different from the previously described insulin protease.\r"

  ".U": "87161603\r", 
  ".W": "It has been previously demonstrated in this laboratory that vitamin D3 is essential for normal insulin secretion from the perfused rat pancreas. More recently we have shown, consistent with a physiological role for the vitamin in this process, that vitamin D-deficient rats exhibit impaired glucose clearance and insulin secretion, as monitored during iv glucose tolerance tests. Both of these parameters are significantly improved after vitamin D repletion independently of nutritional factors and the prevailing plasma calcium and phosphorus concentrations. In this present study the dose response and time course of effect of a single sc injection of the active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion were investigated. The impaired glucose clearance of vitamin D-deficient rats (KG = 912 +/- 37, where KG is a function of glucose tolerance) was markedly improved as early as 3 h after acute 1,25(OH)2D3 (1.3 nmol; 20 U) administration (KG = 676 +/- 13), and this clearance was maintained for up to 20 h (KG = 688 +/- 24). This improvement corresponded to enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion. By 3 h after 1,25-(OH)2D3 substitution, the peak of insulin secretion was elevated by 170% of control values, independently of a significant increase in plasma phosphorus or plasma calcium concentrations. The hypoglycemic propensity of 1,25-(OH)2D3 was also dose dependent. Glucose tolerance was significantly improved (KG = 573 +/- 33), and insulin secretion was maximal (250% of control) after administration of only 0.26 nmol (4 U) 1,25-(OH)2D3. Higher concentrations of seco-steroid, although stimulatory, proved less effective. This study demonstrates a rapid response (within 3 h) to the potentiating action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on in vivo insulin secretion and glucose clearance in the vitamin D-deficient rat. A dose dependence of this hypoglycemic action is also established.\r"

Pituitaries from female rats were enzymatically dispersed and cultured for 48 h in steroid-free alpha-Modified Eagle's Medium, followed by a 24-h culture in medium with or without E2. The cells were then incubated for a 4-h (Exp 1 and 2) or 8-h (Exp 3) period in medium containing radiolabeled precursors with or without GnRH. Radioactive precursor incorporation into LH was determined by immunoprecipitation, while immunoreactive LH (iLH) content was quantified by RIA. In the first experiment, all concentrations of E2 (10(-11)-10(-8) M) enhanced iLH release in response to 1 nM GnRH, confirming previous reports. GnRH increased [3H]glucosamine (3H-Gln) incorporation into LH, but had no effect on [35S]methionine (35S-Met) incorporation. The higher concentrations of E2 enhanced GnRH-stimulated 3H-Gln LH production. In the second experiment, the effects of GnRH (10(-9) M) and E2 (5 X 10(-10) M) on the incorporation of [3H]galactose, [3H]mannose, [3H]fucose, or [35S]sulfate into LH were investigated. Although all precursors were incorporated into LH, no specific effect of GnRH and/or E2 on incorporation of any of the precursors into LH was noted. In Exp 3, pituitary cells were cultured with or without 0.5 nM E2 followed by an 8-h incubation with varying physiological concentrations of GnRH (10(-11)-10(-9) M) and radiolabeled precursors (3H-Gln and 35S-Met). GnRH stimulated iLH release in a dose-dependent manner, and this response was enhanced by E2. GnRH also increased the incorporation of both 3H-Gln and 35S-Met into LH, but the dose of GnRH required for this response was dependent upon the estrogen environment. In the absence of E2, only 10(-9) M GnRH increased 3H-Gln LH and 35S-Met LH production, whereas in cells exposed to E2, all concentrations of GnRH (10(-11)-10(-9) M) increased 3H-Gln LH and 35S-Met LH production. In all experiments, the specific activity of radiolabeled LH released under basal conditions was greatly reduced by stimulation with GnRH. These results suggest that GnRH regulates both LH glycosylation and LH polypeptide synthesis and that E2 lowers the physiological concentration of GnRH necessary to stimulate this biosynthetic response. Moreover, estrogen's enhancement of GnRH-stimulated LH release appears to be due to its action on mechanisms regulating the release of previously synthesized stored hormone as well as the release of newly synthesized LH.\r"

Cultured anterior pituitary cells, previously exposed to estradiol (5 X 10(-10) M) to maximize precursor incorporation were incubated for 4 h in normal calcium (2.5 mM) or low calcium medium (less than 15 microM) containing radiolabeled precursors with or without 1 nM GnRH. In the presence of normal calcium, GnRH significantly increased 3H-Gln-labeled LH in the medium (278%) and cells (290%), as well as total (cells plus medium) 3H- Gln LH (280%) compared to the control value (no GnRH). GnRH also significantly increased the 35S-Met LH released into the medium (164%) and total 35S-Met LH (186%) over control values. Depletion of extracellular calcium completely inhibited GnRH-stimulated 3H-Gln LH and 35S-Met LH production. Total immunoreactive LH (iLH), as measured by RIA, was also increased significantly by GnRH treatment in the presence of calcium, but this response was prevented by removal of calcium from the medium. Lowering extracellular calcium had no effect on cellular uptake or incorporation of 3H-Gln or 35S-Met into total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein. Approximately 80% of newly synthesized LH was released into the medium in all treatment groups independent of whether calcium or GnRH was present. The specific activity (disintegrations per min/microgram iLH) of radiolabeled LH released into the medium was significantly reduced by treatment with GnRH due to the large amount of unlabeled iLH released into the medium. However, when the cells were incubated in low calcium, the SA of 3H-Gln LH and 35S-Met LH in the medium was unaltered by GnRH, whereas GnRH-stimulated iLH release was inhibited. We conclude that GnRH stimulation of LH glycosylation and LH apoprotein synthesis involves extracellular calcium-dependent events, and the release of newly synthesized LH is closely coupled to LH biosynthesis and is less dependent on extracellular calcium, whereas the GnRH-stimulated release of previously synthesized, stored LH is dependent on extracellular calcium.\r"

ACTH infusion for 3 days reduced basal levels of serum T and the T response to GnRH, but did not alter basal levels of serum LH (immunoreactive) or the LH response to GnRH. These effects required the presence of the adrenal glands. Infusion of corticosterone (B) at a dose that increased serum B concentrations 9-fold had an effect similar to that of ACTH on basal serum T levels and the serum T response to GnRH. Basal levels of serum LH and the serum LH response to GnRH were not affected by B administration. These data suggest that ACTH administration reduces the sensitivity of the testes to LH, resulting in a lower basal level of T and a reduced T response to GnRH. This effect was independent of basal serum LH levels or the LH response to GnRH. It appears that B mediates the effect of ACTH on testicular sensitivity to gonadotropin. In another experiment, ACTH administration for 4 days did not alter serum LH values, but reduced serum T levels in sham-castrated male rats. In contrast, ACTH treatment blunted the increase in serum LH after castration by day 2 of treatment, despite the absence of detectable levels of serum T within 6 h after castration. These data suggest that T is not essential for the inhibitory effect of ACTH on LH secretion to occur. They do not support the hypothesis that ACTH enhances the sensitivity of the hypothalamus and/or pituitary to the negative feedback effects of T.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to characterize the metabolic alterations produced by GH that lead to this diabetogenic response in the ob/ob mouse in order to determine whether this animal might serve as a useful model for the study of the cellular mechanisms involved in the diabetogenic action of GH. Female ob/ob mice were treated sc for 3 days with either saline or 200 micrograms/day S-carboxymethylated human GH (RCM-hGH), a diabetogenic GH derivative lacking significant growth-promoting or insulin-like activities. Six hours before the start of the experiment, the animals were given a sc injection of 2 micrograms dexamethasone and deprived of food. RCM-hGH treatment produced marked increases in fasting blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations, but had no effect on plasma glucagon or serum insulin-like growth factor I levels. It had no effect on liver glycogen level or in vitro hepatic glucose production in the absence or presence of pyruvate and lactate added to the incubation medium. By contrast, the in vitro stimulatory effects of insulin on [14C] glucose oxidation by isolated soleus muscle or segments of parametrial fat were greatly attenuated by RCM-hGH treatment, without changes in rates of basal glucose oxidation. This change in peripheral tissue responsiveness to insulin does not appear to involve glucose transport, since the in vitro stimulation by insulin of 3-O-[14C]methylglucose transport into isolated diaphragm muscle was not altered by RCM-hGH treatment. Moreover, the RCM-hGH-induced reduction in adipose tissue responsiveness to insulin does not appear to be mediated by a reduction in insulin binding, since [125I]iodoinsulin binding to adipocytes isolated from RCM-hGH-treated mice was similar to that to cells from saline-treated animals. Interestingly, the reduction in responsiveness to insulin seen with segments of adipose tissue from RCM-hGH-treated animals was not found with isolated adipocytes prepared from such tissue by collagenase digestion. These results suggest that the hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance produced in ob/ob mice by chronic GH treatment result primarily from increased peripheral tissue insulin resistance. Therefore, the ob/ob mouse provides a useful model to elucidate the cellular mechanism(s) of this aspect of the diabetogenic action of GH.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether in infant rats, as in adult rats, the brain adrenergic mechanisms regulate plasma GH levels and, if so, to determine the contribution of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and/or somatostatin (SS) pathways. In 10-day-old rats, activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors by clonidine (CLO) was effective to stimulate GH release starting from 50 micrograms/kg ip and up to 450 micrograms/kg ip, though no dose-related effect was evident. Conversely, alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade by yohimbine (YOH, 10 mg/kg, ip) decreased baseline GH levels. Administration of methoxamine (METHOX, 10 micrograms/rat, ip), a alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, significantly reduced plasma GH concentrations, while prazosin (5 mg/kg BW, ip), a specific alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, stimulated plasma GH secretion. Administration of an anti-SS serum (SS-ab, 300 microliters, ip) induced a significant rise in plasma GH levels, while administration of an anti-GHRH serum (GHRH-ab, 100 microliters, ip) was associated with a striking fall in GH levels. In rats pretreated with SS-ab, administration of CLO induced a further rise in plasma GH levels. GHRH-ab significantly reduced plasma GH levels, and this effect was not altered by subsequent CLO administration. Administration of SS-ab and YOH resulted in plasma GH levels intermediate between those of rats treated with SS-ab alone or YOH alone, while pretreatment with GHRH-ab induced a lowering of plasma GH greater than when YOH was given alone. in rats pretreated with SS-ab, the GH-lowering effect of METHOX was completely lacking, while GHRH-ab and METHOX induced a lowering of plasma GH similar to that ensuing after METHOX alone or GHRH-ab alone. Administration of prazosin in rats pretreated with SS-ab did not elicit any further rise in plasma GH, while combined administration with GHRH-ab elicited a GH-lowering effect comparable to that elicited by GHRH-ab alone. These data demonstrate that in the infant rat: brain adrenergic mechanisms involved in the neural regulation of GH secretion are operative; different neuropeptide mechanisms mediate the effect of activation or inhibition of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors. In particular, activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors stimulates GH secretion via endogenous GHRH release, although a mechanism operating to inhibit hypothalamic SS release cannot be excluded; stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors is inhibitory to GH secretion exclusively via an increased release of hypothalamic SS.\r"

In the present study, a cell perifusion system was employed to characterize the pituitary response to changes in LHRH pulse amplitude and frequency. Increases in pulse amplitude consistently elevated both mean LH levels and the amount of LH released in response to individual LHRH pulses. The EC50 for LHRH was approximately 3 nM. Increases in pulse frequency also increased mean LH levels, but frequencies of three or more pulses per h were associated with a decrease in the amount of LH released per pulse. Alterations in LHRH pulse characteristics changed qualitative as well as quantitative aspects of LH secretion, with high frequency, high amplitude pulses producing a biphasic response to LHRH. Initially a self-priming response was seen during the second and third hours of stimulation; this was followed by increasing desensitization of the cultures to LHRH. These results, by defining the pituitary response to specific conditions of stimulation, will help to clarify the relationship of LHRH stimulation to LH secretion in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that LH secretion is pulsatile and that LH pulse characteristics are affected by the prevailing steroid environment in both male and female rats. In the present study, a cell perifusion system was used to examine the effects of testosterone (T) and 17 beta-estradiol (E) on LHRH-stimulated pulsatile LH secretion. T inhibited LH secretion, increasing the EC50 for LHRH, while E stimulated secretion, lowering the EC50. Steroid effects were independent of both LHRH pulse amplitude and frequency. E also affected the pattern of LH secretion by facilitating both LHRH self-priming and desensitization to LHRH. These results show that steroids can affect pulsatile LH secretion by actions exerted at the pituitary level and that steroids can induce both quantitative and qualitative changes in LH secretion in the presence of an invariant LHRH stimulus. These results help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying steroid feedback in vivo, since reduction in pituitary responsiveness to LHRH may play an important role in T feedback, while facilitation by E of both self-priming and desensitization may serve to increase the magnitude and shorten the duration of the proestrous LH surge.\r"

In the present study we have evaluated the effects of CSH on S-14-like sites in fixed islet D-cells using immunofluorescence and quantitative electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. Monolayer cultures of rat islet cells exposed to CSH (10 mM) for 1 h and subsequently extracted in 1 M acetic acid exhibited a severe reduction in S-14 LI from 6.6 +/- 0.48 to 0.7 +/- 0.06 ng/dish. CSH-induced reduction in S-14 LI persisted when cells were fixed in Zamboni's solution for 16 h and subsequently extracted and assayed. By immunofluorescence, however, the relative numbers of somatostatin-positive cells as well as the fluorescent intensity were identical in control and CSH-treated cells. CSH did not produce any identifiable abnormality in the ultrastructural appearance of D-cells. Protein A-gold labeling of the islet cells showed a uniform distribution of gold particles in both control and CSH-treated cultures. The density of gold particles over D-cell secretory granules from CSH-exposed cultures (36.6 +/- 3.5 particles/micron2) was not different from that in control D-cell granules (42.2 +/- 5.9 particles/micron2). These data clearly indicate that despite a profound reduction by CSH of S-14 LI in tissue extracts, there is no detectable decrease in the same antigenic sites in tissue sections when assessed immunocytochemically.\r"

This material stimulates casein release in the absence of added PRL and is actually more potent than PRL in this regard. The substance(s) possesses the following additional characteristics: it is released from liver tissue of lactating but not virgin female or male rats; when tested together with PRL, its effects are additive rather than synergistic; and unlike PRL, it does not increase the proportion of mammary cells committed to casein release. These findings are consistent with the possibility that a Liver Lactogenic Factor may mediate, at least in part, the lactogenic component of PRL's action. This functional relationship may be similar to that which exists between GH and the somatomedins.\r"

Six normally active, nontraining (C-NT) women kept their activity constant. Each subject completed monthly intensity-graded questionnaires or kept daily symptoms diaries concerning premenstrual symptoms. All monitored basal body temperature, weight, and exercise. Gonadal steroids were measured in ST women. For ST subjects, breast (P = 0.005), fluid (P = 0.01), and personal stress (P = 0.025) decreased. MT women experienced decreased fluid (P = 0.034) and depression (P = 0.014). Anxiety tended to decrease (P = 0.087). ST and MT subjects experienced decreases in premenstrual symptoms without documented hormonal, menstrual cycle, or weight changes. These symptom changes appear to be the earliest evidence of the effects of conditioning exercise on the reproductive system.\r"

  ".W": "Linear regression analysis was used to assess the serial growth of carefully measured individual mean follicular diameters as a function of menstrual age in a group of normal volunteers in natural, unstimulated cycles (n = 18). Follicle diameter (FD) growth, as measured with serial pelvic ultrasonography, can be shown to be essentially linear (mean R2, 0.92) with respect to time up to the point of ovulation. Growth rate (k) and the calculated date of growth onset (Do) are obtainable from the individual regression equations. Because an approximation of the date of ovulation (Dov, measured by menstrual age at the date of peak mean follicular size) is an available parameter, total growth period (TGP) is calculated with the equation (TGP = Dov - Do). Do, k, and TGP are highly correlated with one another. The mean parameters (+/- standard deviation) are Do = 4.29 +/- 2.77 day, k = 0.24 +/- 0.07 cm/day, TGP = 10.32 +/- 2.35 day, peak FD = 2.34 +/- 0.28 cm, and Dov = 14.61 +/- 2.00 day. The internal correlation of these parameters predicts that information from the first several scans in an individual series may be used to forecast date of ovulation. This may represent an improvement over the use of follicle size or menstrual age alone in planning for human chorionic gonadotropin administration, insemination timing, follicular aspiration and other interventions.\r"

All patients had greater than 20% IgG or IgA immunobinding to sperm in their seminal plasma and 7 had immunobinding levels of greater than 50%. Sperm from these men were less able to penetrate an overlaying buffer layer than sperm from a fertile control. Addition of immunobeads to the specimen was of little use, because few motile sperm could swim into the overlaying buffer; retained immunobeads were noted in the buffer layer of 18-hour capacitated specimens. Magnetic isolation of antibody-coated sperm from antibody-free sperm avoids potential damage to fragile sperm through centrifugation. Viable spermatozoa were isolated from magnetite-complexed spermatozoa, but the motility of the isolated spermatozoa deteriorated rapidly during the subsequent capacitation period. Passage of diluted ejaculate through a column of dextran beads for antisperm antibody processing (ASAP) was associated with superior sperm quality and fertilizing potential. The use of ASAP resulted in good sperm velocity and linearity and improved sperm function, as measured with the hamster egg penetration test. Sperm from men with immunologically mediated infertility can be processed through the ASAP and used for artificial insemination of their partners or in an in vitro fertilization program.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty husbands in childless couples, aged 24 to 35 years, were treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) for idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) of peripubertal (incomplete) type. They were azoospermic or oligospermic, with less than 1.5 X 10(6)/ml nonmotile spermatozoa. The diagnosis of IHH was based on clinical and laboratory features and testicular biopsy specimen study and was further supported by results of stimulation tests and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) test. Two treatment modalities were used: subcutaneous injections of 500 micrograms LH-RH twice daily; and perpetual subcutaneous injection, via portable infusion pump, of 25 ng/kg LH-RH, at 90-minute intervals. Two patients required a short second period of pulsatile treatment to cause a second pregnancy of their spouses. The pump proved to yield better results, compared with intermittent injections, in respect to endocrine responses, spermatogenesis, and fertility capacity. Normal levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone were reached in 2 to 3 weeks and normal testosterone levels in 8 to 10 weeks from the start of treatment. Sperm counts rose to greater than 60 X 10(6)/ml viable spermatozoa with less than 15% of abnormal forms in 3 to 5 months, and the wives conceived. Of a total of 18 deliveries of healthy infants, 12 offspring were identified genetically with their fathers. Four women were still pregnant at the conclusion of the study. The pump was well tolerated, without special operational problems to the patients. Pulsatile treatment is therefore recommended in the treatment of well-diagnosed and carefully selected cases of incomplete IHH.\r"

A difference was noted and was attributed to the effect of stimulation of the endometriotic foci by ovarian activity. Danazol does not eradicate endometriosis. When suppression is discontinued, the disease will return with time.

We studied the aspect of the BM in 16 patients with endometriosis, 4 in each of the stages of the rAFS classification, and demonstrated all endometriosis lesions in all patients to be surrounded by a continuous and intact BM. We conclude that studying the BM in endometriosis offers no advantage in determining the prognosis of the disease and its possible response to therapy.\r"

We examined planar sections stained for VIP by the avidin-biotin complex method, measured VIP content in mucosa and muscularis propria by radioimmunoassay, and compared neural structures reactive to VIP antiserum with those revealed by osmication in the presence of zinc iodide. Immunoreactive terminal nerves interlaced smooth muscle bundles in all layers in all smooth muscle regions, formed loose tangled knots about widely dispersed muscle cells in striated muscle, and supplied vessels and submucosal glands. Bipolar interstitial cells in the circular muscle layer stained by osmication were not VIP-immunoreactive. Perikarya in both submucous and myenteric plexuses were VIP-immunoreactive. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-immunoreactive oval cells with round unstained nuclei and a faintly granular cytoplasm were scattered in the muscle in all regions and were concentrated in the planes of the plexuses. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide content of muscularis propria in the smooth muscle esophageal body exceeded (p less than or equal to 0.05) that in the striated muscle esophageal body and the sphincter region, but contents in the latter two regions did not differ (p greater than or equal to 0.05). Mucosal content exceeded that of muscularis propria. The broad distribution and diversity of immunoreactive structures suggest that VIP may have functions in this organ besides the regulation of smooth muscle.\r"

This study validates the technique as a means of measuring gastric emptying. Experiments in vitro showed an excellent correlation between measurements of resistivity and either the square of the radius of a glass rod or the volume of water in a spherical balloon when both were placed in an oval tank containing saline. Altering the lateral position of the rod in the tank did not alter the values obtained. Images of abdominal resistivity were also directly correlated with the volume of air in a gastric balloon. Profiles of gastric emptying of liquid meals obtained using applied potential tomography were very similar to those obtained using scintigraphy or dye dilution techniques, provided that acid secretion was inhibited by cimetidine. Profiles of emptying of a mashed potato meal using applied potential tomography were also very similar to those obtained by scintigraphy. Measurements of the emptying of a liquid meal from the stomach were reproducible if acid secretion was inhibited by cimetidine. Thus, applied potential tomography is an accurate and reproducible method of measuring gastric emptying of liquids and particulate food. It is inexpensive, well tolerated, easy to use, and ideally suited for multiple studies in patients, even those who are pregnant.\r"

Measures of esophageal and psychologic symptoms were completed at entry and at each follow-up visit. Esophageal manometry was repeated at the termination of the trial. Upon completion of the treatment, patients receiving trazodone (n = 15) reported a significantly greater global improvement than those receiving placebo (n = 14; p = 0.02). Although a variable clinical response was observed, the trazodone group had less residual distress over esophageal symptoms compared with the placebo group (59% +/- 9% vs. 108% +/- 19%, p = 0.03). Manometric changes observed during the course of the trial were not influenced by treatment nor by clinical response. Remarkable reductions in ratings of chest pain were reported by both treatment groups, emphasizing the importance of controlled trials when studying this patient population. We conclude that low-dose trazodone therapy can be of benefit in the management of symptomatic patients with esophageal contraction abnormalities. In addition, our findings support recent observations that manometric abnormalities characterizing this patient group may not be solely responsible for symptoms.\r"

Clinical diagnosis of venocclusive disease was based on the development of ascites, hepatomegaly, and jaundice 3 wk after transplantation. Current treatment of hepatic venocclusive disease is ineffective. The pathophysiology of the hepatic lesion suggests that construction of a side-to-side portacaval shunt should be beneficial in relieving the ascites and preventing further hepatic damage. Because the ascites was refractory to medical therapy and she was clinically deteriorating, a side-to-side portacaval shunt was performed. Histologic examination of a liver biopsy specimen obtained at surgery documented the presence of venocclusive disease. Postoperatively, the patient diuresed and returned to her baseline weight. One year after surgery the patient was doing well, her weight was stable, and she was being maintained on salt restriction alone. While the resolution of ascites and improvement of hepatic function in our patient after side-to-side portacaval shunt does not guarantee that such an approach will be uniformly successful, it should serve to encourage others to consider such therapy for this frequently devastating complication of chemoradiation therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Antibodies to different peptides produced from the gastrin precursor have been used in light microscopic- and electron microscopic-immunogold studies of gastrinoma tissue and normal antral mucosa. Antibodies to the C terminus of progastrin, which are known to react with the intact precursor, revealed immunoreactive material in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi region, and electron-dense granules in gastrinoma cells. In normal antrum these antibodies again revealed the Golgi region and a population of electron-dense granules. Other antibodies that react with the products of progastrin processing, but not the precursor, e.g., C-terminal and N-terminal gastrin 17 specific antibodies, revealed only granules. In addition to electron-dense granules already mentioned, the latter antibodies also revealed electron-lucent and intermediate granule populations, which in antrum were the major granule types. It is proposed that the intact precursor occurs in rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi; thereafter, in the immature electron-dense granules, and subsequently in electron-lucent granules, biosynthetic processing liberates gastrin 17 and gastrin 34, which are the major active products of gastrin gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) was studied in extracts of porcine pancreata. Gel filtration and high-pressure liquid chromatographic profiles of these extracts as monitored with both C-terminally and N-terminally directed radioimmunoassays against GRP showed pancreatic GRP to consist of one main form, namely the 27-amino acid peptide originally extracted from porcine stomach, and small amounts of a C-terminal fragment identical with the C-terminal 10-amino acid peptide. Gastrin-releasing peptide-like immunoreactivity released from the isolated perfused porcine pancreas during electrical vagal stimulation was shown by gel filtration to consist of the same two forms. By use of immunocytochemical techniques employing an antiserum directed against its N terminus, GRP was localized to varicose nerve fibers in close association with the exocrine tissue of the porcine pancreas in particular. Some fibers were found penetrating into pancreatic islets also. Immunoreactive nerve cell bodies as well as fibers were found within intrapancreatic ganglia. The potency of GRP in stimulating exocrine as well as endocrine secretion from the porcine pancreas, its presence in close contact with both acini and islets, and its release during vagal stimulation indicate that GRP may have a role in the parasympathetic regulation of endocrine and exocrine secretion from the pig pancreas.\r"

A reduction in the biologic action of insulin, at a point beyond the insulin receptor (postbinding site), is primarily responsible for the reduced rate of glucose utilization. The contributions made by the \"molecular\" events of aging and environmental factors such as changes in diet, activity level, and body composition to the alterations in glucose metabolism are not well defined. Whether impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus contributes to morbidity or mortality in the aging population is not known.\r"

In part 1, 14 male patients were given ispaghula husk in increasing doses of 10 g, 20 g, and 30 g a day for a duration of 17 days each (14 days of study period + three days of stool collection). Ten patients completed the trial. The symptom score improved significantly with all the three doses of ispaghula. Both 20 g and 30 g doses of ispaghula were superior to the 10 g dose but there was no significant difference between the 20 g and 30 g doses. There was a significant (p less than 0.001) increase in the daily stool weight with 10 g dose of fibre with further significant increases with the 20 g and 30 g doses. A positive correlation was seen between the improvement in the symptom score and the increase in stool weight with the 10 g dose of ispaghula but not with the 20 g and 30 g doses. Whole gut transit time remained fairly constant throughout the study period and there was no relationship with either the dose of ispaghula, the alteration in stool weight, or the improvement in the patients symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Twenty eight patients with classical irritable bowel syndrome completed a double blind placebo controlled crossover trial in which they added to their normal diet a daily supplement of either 12 bran biscuits (1 = 1.3 g fibre) or 12 placebo biscuits (1 = 0.23 g fibre). Each biscuit was given for three months in random order with crossover to the alternative biscuit at three months. After the initial three months therapy, there was a significant symptomatic improvement compared with pretreatment in both the bran treated (p less than 0.01) and placebo treated groups (p less than 0.01), but there was no significant difference in symptom scores between these two groups. There was no further improvement in either group after the second three months treatment with the alternative therapy. When crossover data for all 28 subjects were combined, symptoms scores after three months bran therapy and after three months placebo therapy did not differ significantly. Twenty four patients completed three day stool collections in both treatment periods. When the symptomatic response to bran among 15 subjects in whom stool weights rose on bran was compared with that among nine subjects whose stool weights were static or fell on the bran, it was shown that symptomatic improvement was independent of an increase in stool weight. These data suggest that in irritable bowel syndrome, especially that associated with abdominal pain, the beneficial effects of bran are due to a placebo response which is independent of an increase in stool weight.\r"

The main objectives of the study were a comparison of ranitidine and sucralfate in ulcer treatment, and to observe the influence of continued NSAID administration during peptic ulcer therapy. Ulcers healed within nine weeks in 52 patients. The mean healing time was similar in 27 patients given ranitidine 150 mg bd (4.9 weeks) and 25 patients given sucralfate 1 g qid (4.6 weeks). In patients with unhealed ulcers after nine weeks of treatment, healing was obtained in seven after further therapy for 3-9 weeks. Of the 30 patients who continued NSAIDs during treatment with either ranitidine or sucralfate, 23 ulcers healed (mean healing time: 5.0 weeks). Of 32 patients in whom NSAIDs were stopped, ulcer healing was documented in 29 (mean healing time: 4.6 weeks). The difference in healing rates was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.10). The outcome of ulcer treatment did not differ in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and patients suffering from osteoarthritis. During a 12 month follow up 14 symptomatic ulcer recurrences were recorded.\r"

Desmin staining was used as a marker in the isolation of the Ito cells, and a highly purified desmin-positive cell fraction was obtained. Less than 10% of the desmin-positive cells were positive for vitamin A auto-fluorescence. However, the number of vitamin A-positive cells increased with vitamin A treatment, and they extended to over half of the desmin-positive cells by the first week of vitamin A treatment. The cultured Ito cells were positive for both desmin and vimentin stainings. On the other hand, Kupffer and endothelial cells were positive only with vimentin staining. Ito cells lost their fat droplets after repeated subculturing. The electron microscopic features of the Ito cells became similar to those of myofibroblasts, except for the absence of dense bodies, indicating that the Ito cells may have possibly transformed into myofibroblasts. Collagen fibers were occasionally found in the extracellular space. These results indicate that Ito cells retain both their myogenic and fibrogenic properties, and that lipocytes or myofibroblasts may be desmin-positive cells which maintain specific functions. Furthermore, staining of the intermediate filaments is useful in the identification of Ito cells, and a highly purified Ito cell fraction can be easily obtained using desmin staining as a marker.\r"

After randomization, but before treatment had been started, a total of eight patients had to be withdrawn from the study due to early rebleeding (requiring emergency sclerotherapy) or violations of the protocol. Among the 70 patients analyzed (36 sclerotherapy, 34 propranolol), both treatment groups were comparable with respect to demographic, clinical and laboratory data. The groups also did not differ with respect to continued alcohol intake. Sclerotherapy was performed twice weekly using 1% polidocanol as the sclerosing agent until the varices were eradicated or well-covered by fibrous tissue. Propranolol was given twice daily at a dose reducing the resting heart rate by 25% (60 to 320 mg per day; mean +/- SD = 161 +/- 80 mg per day). Patients were followed for up to 2 years with visits at 3 monthly intervals (mean follow-up = sclerotherapy, 14 months; propranolol, 9.2 months). Life table analysis of patients without rebleeding from nonvariceal sites revealed a tendency in favor of propranolol; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance. No significant difference was observed between sclerotherapy and propranolol in the proportion of patients rebleeding from esophageal varices or from all sources of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Furthermore, survival was similar in both treatment groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The small-for-size livers transplanted into the Group I dogs rapidly increased in size over the course of 2 weeks until they achieved a size equal to that originally present in the larger recipient dogs. In contrast, the livers transplanted into dogs of the same size as the donors underwent some degree of atrophy. In both groups of animals, plasma levels of insulin and glucagon and hepatic (graft) activities of thymidine kinase and ornithine decarboxylase were followed serially. The only difference between the two groups of animals for these measures was that the ornithine decarboxylase activity rose to a greater degree in the liver that underwent graft enlargement. These data suggest that recipient size determines, at least in part, liver graft size once it is transplanted. These data also suggest that of the parameters followed, only ornithine decarboxylase activity parallels the finding of growth of the transplanted liver.\r"

The pulse rate did not change, but renal blood flow (p-aminohippurate clearance) increased (from 902 +/- 78 to 1108 +/- 130 ml/min/1.73 m2; p less than 0.05). The Mg2+ infusion produced a significant increase in the excretion of the stable prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) metabolite 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (from 96 +/- 12 to 154 +/- 16 ng/g creatinine; p less than 0.01). In contrast, urinary PGE2 was not altered (328 +/- 75 vs 399 +/- 145 ng/g creatinine; p greater than 0.6). To evaluate the functional role of PGI2 release, the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin (75 mg) or ibuprofen (600 mg) were given before the Mg2+ infusion. Both cyclooxygenase blockers, given in doses that inhibited immunoreactive 6-keto-PGF1 alpha release, completely prevented the Mg2+-induced decline in blood pressure and increased renal blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Blood pressure, plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP), and renal excretory responses to short-term water loading (oral load of 20 ml/kg body weight over 30-45 minutes) were compared in 10 normotensive and 13 mild to moderately essential hypertensive subjects. In addition, we examined the renal concentrating ability of an additional group of 10 normotensive subjects and 12 hypertensive subjects in response to a 24-hour water restriction and intranasal administration of 10 micrograms of [1-deamino,8-D-arginine]vasopression. The hypertensive subjects exhibited both an exaggerated diuresis and natriuresis to the water load. At 20- and 60-minutes after water loading, hypertensive subjects had excreted 34 and 55% of the load, respectively, compared with 15 and 35% in normotensive subjects. Mean blood pressure rose significantly in both groups and hypertensive subjects exhibited a greater rise of systolic blood pressure (16 mm Hg) than normotensive subjects (8 mm Hg) 20 minutes after water loading. The maximum diuresis and natriuresis corresponded to the period in which the rise of blood pressure was greatest. The hypertensive subjects diluted and concentrated their urine as well as normotensive subjects did, indicating normal renal responsiveness to AVP. Plasma Na, osmolality, and AVP decreased similarly in both groups after water loading and rose similarly in the two groups after water restriction. This finding suggests that osmotic responsiveness of AVP is not altered in hypertensive subjects. In conclusion, the data suggest that the exaggerated renal response to water loading could be explained by the greater rise of blood pressure in hypertensive subjects rather than by altered AVP responses.\r"

A nitrogen mustard (M + E) group (n = 6), a hydroxyurea (H + E) group (n = 5), and a control (E) group (n = 7) were given 1-h infusions of endotoxin (5 micrograms/kg total dose), then monitored for up to 5 h. Postmortem extravascular lung water (EVLW) was significantly higher in the M + E group (14.2 +/- 4.4 ml/kg) and the E group (11.9 +/- 3.9 ml/kg) when compared with a normal control (6.6 +/- 1.3 ml/kg) group that did not receive endotoxin. EVLW in a group made neutropenic with nitrogen mustard (6.7 +/- 1.3 ml/kg) and the H + E (7.9 +/- 1.5 ml/kg) groups were not statistically different from each other or from normal controls. Circulating neutrophil counts averaged 32 +/- 42 cells/microliter in the M + E group and 180 +/- 210 cells/microliter in the H + E group. Only minimal histological changes were seen in the H + E group, but the E and M + E lungs had severe pulmonary edema. We conclude that neutrophils are not required for increased EVLW and decreased arterial O2 partial pressure after endotoxin infusion, and hydroxyurea prevents at least part of the pulmonary edema after endotoxin by a mechanism that is not neutrophil dependent.\r"

Compared with PEEP alone, LBPP increased cardiac index (CI) from 3.57 to 4.76 l X min-1 X m-2 (P less than 0.001) in relation to changes in right atrial pressure (RAP) (11 to 16 mmHg; P less than 0.01). Cardiopulmonary blood volume (CPBV) measured in five patients increased during LBPP from 546 +/- 126 to 664 +/- 150 ml (P less than 0.01), with a positive linear relationship between changes in RAP and CPBV (r = 0.88; P less than 0.001). Venous admixture (Qva/QT) decreased with PEEP from 24 to 16% (P less than 0.001) but did not change with LBPP despite the large increase in CI, leading to a marked O2 availability increase (P less than 0.001). Although PEEP induced a significant rise in plasma norepinephrine level (NE) (from 838 +/- 97 to 1008 +/- 139 pg/ml; P less than 0.05), NE was significantly decreased by LBPP to control level (from 1,008 +/- 139 to 794 +/- 124 pg/ml; P less than 0.003). Plasma epinephrine levels were not influenced by PEEP or LBPP. Changes of plasma renin activity (PRA) paralleled those of NE. No change in plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) was recorded. We concluded that LBPP increases venous return and CPBV and counteracts hemodynamic effects of PEEP ventilation, without significant change in Qva/QT. Mechanical ventilation with PEEP stimulates sympathetic activity and PRA apparently by a reflex neuronal mechanism, at least partially inhibited by the loading of cardiopulmonary low-pressure reflex and high-pressure baroreflex. Finally, AVP does not appear to be involved in the acute cardiovascular adaptation to PEEP.\r"

Eight tracheae from New Zealand White rabbits were excised and mounted at a fixed length in an organ bath. Electrical field stimulation (EFS) was performed in isovolumetric and isobaric conditions at varying transmural pressures (TMP). Supramaximal stimulation with methacholine was done at 0 TMP. Active change in pressure (delta P) with EFS showed a peak at 3.1 +/- 1.06 cmH2O TMP during inflation and at 4.1 +/- 1.18 cmH2O TMP during deflation (mean +/- SE). Active delta P decreased at higher or lower TMP. Active change in volume with EFS showed a peak at 3.2 +/- 1.26 cmH2O TMP during inflation and at 1.8 +/- 0.98 cmH2O TMP during deflation. A decrease in response was also observed at higher and lower TMP. From these data, we concluded that TSM is at optimal length (Lmax) at TMP of 2-3 cmH2O. Maximal TSM shortening with supramaximal stimulation with methacholine was 32% Lmax. This figure is considerably smaller than the 80% shortening found in unloaded strips of TSM. We conclude that rabbit TSM length is close to Lmax at TMP similar to those found at functional residual capacity and that the loads that the muscle has to overcome probably contribute to the limited shortening observed in situ.\r"

The exercise group was given access to voluntary running wheels at age 6 mo. The rats were studied at ages 12 and 28 mo. Sedentary free-eating (SFE) rats were obese and their fat cells were extremely insulin resistant, showing minimal increases in glucose oxidation and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DOG) uptake in response to high insulin concentrations. The runners' adipocytes were smaller and had a greater responsiveness to insulin (approximately 9-fold for 2-DOG uptake and approximately 30-fold for glucose oxidation) than those of the SFE rats. Sedentary rats that were food restricted to keep their body weights the same as those of the runners had fat cells that were intermediate both in size and insulin responsiveness relative to those of the SFE rats and runners. There was a close correlation between fat cell size and responsiveness to insulin of 2-DOG uptake and glucose oxidation independent of age. There were no significant differences in fat cell size, insulin sensitivity, or insulin responsiveness between the adult (12 mo) and old (28 mo) rats in the same treatment groups. We conclude that aging alone has little or no effect on the responsiveness to insulin of glucose metabolism in fat cells and that the insulin resistance of adipocytes from obese older rats is due to fat cell hypertrophy, not aging. Exercise is effective in protecting against development of fat cell hypertrophy and insulin resistance.\r"

No cells have been identified within the brain that are indisputedly chemoreceptors for CO2 or H+, but there is abundant evidence that respiration can be affected by chemical, electrical, and thermal stimuli applied locally to the ventral surface of the medulla. Furthermore, the actions of traditional central chemical respiratory stimuli can be blunted or abolished after inhibition of neural function within this ventrolateral medullary shell (VMS). The VMS is an integrative region for cardiovascular and respiratory function and may be involved in nociception. The distinction between the former two is not always clear, but recent studies using microinjection techniques seem promising for identifying the respiratory substrates. The many recent advances elucidating anatomic connections between the VMS and other brain regions are important but do not directly address the question of the site of central respiratory chemosensitivity. Knowledge of such connections, however, should provide more definitive opportunities for addressing this question.\r"

  ".W": "In five healthy subjects, we studied the effects of controlled mechanical unloading of the respiratory system on ventilatory control during moderate exercise, utilizing a modified positive-pressure ventilator (IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. BME-33: 361-365, 1986). We were especially interested in whether isocapnia was maintained when a portion of the normal ventilatory response to constant-load cycling was subserved by the ventilator. The mechanical unloading was achieved by \"assisting\" airflow throughout inspiration in a constant proportion to instantaneous flow. Two modest degrees of assistance (A1 = 1.5 and A2 = 3.0 cmH2O X l-1 X s) were imposed. The assistance caused minute ventilation (VE) to increase immediately (inspiratory time shortening and tidal volume rising) and end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) to fall. Some 10-15 s later, inspiratory occlusion pressure (P100) decreased, and in the new steady-state VE and PETCO2 were virtually restored to their control exercise levels. The modest residual hyperventilation [delta PETCO2 = -0.9 Torr (A1) and -1.6 Torr (A2)], which was not significant statistically, contrasted markedly with the much larger increase predicted for VE had there been no compensatory reduction in ventilatory drive (as evidenced by the fall in P100). Consistent with earlier studies utilizing resistive loading (J. Appl. Physiol. 35: 361-366, 1973 and Acta Physiol. Scand. 120: 557-565, 1984), these observations suggest that ventilatory drive during moderate exercise is controlled to compensate for modest changes in respiratory-mechanical load, so that VE is preserved at a level appropriate to metabolic rate or nearly so.\r"

In eight alpha-chloralose-anesthetized mechanically ventilated sheep (23-27 kg), the common bronchial artery, the bronchial branch of the bronchoesophageal artery, was cannulated and perfused with a pump. The control bronchial blood flow (avg 12 +/- 1 ml/min or 0.48 ml X min-1 X kg-1) was set to maintain mean bronchial arterial pressure equal to systemic blood pressure. Pressure-flow curves of the bronchial circulation were measured by making step changes in bronchial blood flow, and changes in these curves were analyzed with measurements of the pressure at zero flow and the slope of the linearized curve. The zero-flow pressure represents the effective downstream pressure, and the slope represents the resistance through the bronchial vasculature. At a constant bronchial arterial pressure of 100 mmHg, an 8 mmHg increase in mean airway pressure caused a 40% reduction in bronchial blood flow. Under constant flow conditions, increases in mean airway pressure with the application of PEEP caused substantial increases in bronchial arterial pressure, averaging 4.6 mmHg for every millimeters of mercury increase in mean airway pressure. However, bronchial arterial pressure at zero flow increased approximately one-for-one with increases in mean airway pressure. Thus the acute sensitivity of the bronchial artery to changes in mean airway pressure results primarily from changes in bronchovascular resistance and not downstream pressure.\r"

  ".W": "The preparation for collecting lung lymph from sheep caudal mediastinal lymph node (CMN) efferent vessels is widely used to study the effects of endotoxin on lung microvascular permeability. However, there are nonpulmonary lymph vessels that drain into the CMN along with the afferent lymph vessels from the lung. Thus CMN lymph is a mixture of lymph from the lung and diaphragm lymph vessels as well as from other nonpulmonary lymph vessels. We studied the effect of 0.5-1.0 microgram/kg Escherichia coli endotoxin on the flow rates in diaphragm and CMN efferent lymph vessels (Qdi and QCMN, respectively) in unanesthetized sheep. For the time period between 2 and 5.5 h after endotoxin QCMN was increased from its base line of 7.2 +/- 4.4 (SD) to 17.3 +/- 10.6 ml/h and the lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio (L/PCMN) had increased from 0.68 +/- 0.11 to 0.81 +/- 0.06. During the same time period, Qdi was 4.5 +/- 3.1 ml/h compared with 1.0 +/- 0.8 ml/h at base line and the diaphragm lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio (L/Pdi) was 0.92 +/- 0.07 (base line = 0.74 +/- 0.15). The increases in flow rate and protein concentration were significant for each type of vessel (P less than 0.05). We conclude that the period of increased QCMN and L/PCMN after endotoxin is associated with an increase in Qdi and L/Pdi. Thus, it is difficult to determine how much of the CMN lymph response comes from the lungs and how much comes from diaphragm lymph vessels.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the pulmonary response to bone marrow embolism in untreated and indomethacin-treated goats. Pulmonary arterial pressure increased by 15 cmH2O after bone marrow infusion, reaching a peak of 37.2 then stabilizing at greater than 30 cmH2O in the control group. In the treated group it increased by 4.3 cmH2O from a base line of 18.5 cmH2O but had returned to base line by 6 h. Lymph flow increased in the control group from a base line of 7.3 ml/h to a peak of 22.4 ml/h and remained near that level. It increased from a base line of 6.4 ml/h to a peak of 9.8 ml/h in the treated group and remained close to that value. The lymph-to-plasma protein ratio was little changed throughout the experiment. Cardiac output decreased by 1.2 l/min in the control group but was unchanged from base line in the treated group. Systemic arterial pressure was similar in both groups of animals. We conclude that indomethacin prevents the pulmonary hypertension seen after bone marrow infusion and protects against some of the increased permeability.\r"

Because recent reports suggest that there may be advantages of intra-aortic versus intra-venous administration we prospectively evaluated cardiorespiratory features 1 and 10 minutes after rapid administering of protamine sulphate either into the aortic arch (through a catheter percutaneously inserted via the radial artery for monitoring purposes) or into the right atrium. Significant variations in some parameters were found in the patients receiving the drug via the aorta, such as a drop of systemic vascular resistances (p less than 0.05), of coronary perfusion pressure (p less than 0.05), of aortic systolic pressure (p less than 0.01), of diastolic (p less than 0.01) and mean blood pressure (p less than 0.05) and a rise in the respiratory quotient (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that the results do not confirm the superior safety of intra-aortic administration of protamine particularly when replenishment of intravascular volume is not provided.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of aortic aneurysms by ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT) is now commonplace and their use often reflects personal preferences given their similar diagnostic accuracy. Knowledge of anatomic details may be very helpful in the planning of the surgical procedure. Involvement of the supra-renal aorta, relative position of the renal arteries, intra-aneurysmal thrombus, and extension to the iliac arteries were retrospectively evaluated by both techniques to determine which modality was more valuable in the preoperative evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysms. A group of 58 patients was reviewed. An infra-renal aortic aneurysm was identified in all instances by both methods. The supra-renal aorta was always well visualized by CT but not by US. The origin of at least one renal artery was seen in only 11% of the cases by US but in 100% by CT. CT demonstrated the left renal vein in all cases, while only 41% were demonstrated by US. Intra-aneurysmal thrombus was depicted by both methods but its distribution within the sac and the characteristics of the thrombus were apparent on CT but not on US. Aneurysmal involvement of the iliac arteries was present in 19% of the patients. CT detected all cases but only 14% were demonstrated by US. Both methods accurately diagnose abdominal aortic aneurysms. Supplementary data regarding proximal and distal extension, characteristics of the thrombus, relationship to the renal vessels, and adjacent major veins can be obtained by CT and usually not by US. This information is of value in the planning and execution of the indicated surgical procedure.\r"

Using immunoprecipitation techniques, we demonstrated that exposure to 8-bromo-cAMP prevented the de novo synthesis and secretion of the extracellular matrix component fibronectin, but enhanced the production of hCG subunits. The effects of the cyclic nucleotide on synthesis and secretion of these proteins were evident within 24 h. 8-Bromo-cAMP increased the cellular content of mRNA encoding the hCG alpha- and beta-subunits and prevented the increase in fibronectin mRNA, as determined by blot hybridization analysis using specific cDNA probes. These findings demonstrate that cyclic nucleotides regulate the synthesis of several specific proteins in cultured human trophoblast by regulating levels of the mRNAs encoding the proteins. The actions of cyclic nucleotides in this regard may be essential for the normal expression of trophoblast endocrine function.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo glucose uptake (Rd) occurs via two mechanisms: 1) insulin-mediated glucose uptake (IMGU), which occurs in insulin-sensitive tissues, and 2) noninsulin-mediated glucose uptake (NIMGU), which occurs in both insulin-sensitive and insulin-insensitive tissues. Thus, in the postabsorptive (basal) state Rd = IMGU + NIMGU. To determine whether these two pathways for in vivo glucose disposal are regulated independently, we studied the effect of stress levels of epinephrine (EPI) on IMGU and NIMGU in seven normal men after an overnight fast. To study NIMGU, somatostatin (600 micrograms/hr) was infused to suppress endogenous insulin secretion, and glucose turnover was measured isotopically while the serum glucose level was clamped at about 200 mg/dL for 240 min. Separate studies were done during the infusion of saline or EPI (0.2 microgram/kg X min). The final 120 min of each study were used for data analysis. Under these conditions insulin action is absent and Rd = NIMGU. NIMGU was 210 +/- 15 (+/- SEM) and 200 +/- 17 mg/min during saline and EPI treatment, respectively (P = NS). Therefore, EPI has no ability to modulate NIMGU. To measure the effect of EPI on Rd, hyperglycemic (200 mg/dL) hyperinsulinemic clamp (30 mU/M2 X min) studies were performed during the infusion of saline and EPI. EPI decreased Rd by 46 +/- 6% (751 +/- 85 to 405 +/- 43 mg/min; P less than 0.01). When the effect of EPI on IMGU (Rd - NIMGU) was considered separately, the inhibitory effect of EPI was more potent, as indicated by a 61 +/- 12% decrease in IMGU. In conclusion, 1) EPI inhibits IMGU, but has no effect on NIMGU; 2) when NIMGU is taken into account, EPI has a more potent ability to inhibit IMGU than previously found; and 3) the systems responsible for NIMGU and IMGU are independently regulated.\r"

  ".W": "The physiological significance of the hyperglucagonemia that occurs in patients with many catabolic conditions is unclear. The effect of hyperglucagonemia on resting metabolic rate (RMR) was studied in six normal subjects. Infusion of somatostatin (SRIH; 500 micrograms/h for 210 min) resulted in a 5-fold decrease in plasma C-peptide and a 2-fold decrease in plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations, but did not change RMR significantly. When glucagon (0.2 micrograms/kg X h), was infused with SRIH (500 micrograms/h for 210 min), the decreases in plasma C-peptide and insulin were similar to that during the infusion of SRIH alone, but plasma glucagon increased from 160 +/- 24 (+/- SEM) to 560 +/- 80 pg/mL (P less than 0.001). There was a significant increase in RMR during the entire period (210 min) of glucagon infusion (P less than 0.01). During the last hour of the glucagon plus SRIH infusion, the RMR was 1.38 +/- 0.10 Cal/min, which was 15% higher than the preinfusion RMR (1.19 +/- 0.10 Cal/min; P less than 0.01) and 14% higher than the RMR during the same period when SRIH alone was infused (1.21 +/- 0.11 Cal/min; P less than 0.01). When SRIH and glucagon were infused, protein oxidation (calculated from urinary nitrogen loss) was 52 +/- 5 mg/min, 29% higher than when SRIH alone was infused (40 +/- 5 mg/min; P less than 0.05). These results indicate that hyperglucagonemia during insulin deficiency results in an increase in energy expenditure, which may contribute to the catabolic state in many conditions.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the severity of insulin resistance in obesity, as assessed by the traditional hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp, reflects the severity of resistance present during changing insulin concentrations, such as occur after meal ingestion, 9 moderately obese and 12 lean subjects were studied on 2 occasions: once during a primed continuous insulin infusion and once during a variable 8-step insulin infusion. Identical amounts of insulin were given on each occasion, and euglycemia was maintained by a glucose infusion. Stimulation of isotopically determined glucose utilization above the basal value was lower in the obese than in the lean subjects during the variable [2.4 +/- 0.5 (+/- SEM) vs. 5.4 +/- 0.7 g/m2; P = 0.004] and the constant (2.9 +/- 0.7 vs 4.2 +/- 0.9 g/m2; P = 0.32) insulin infusions; however, the differences were only significant with the variable insulin infusion. The variable insulin infusion also was associated with lower rates of activation of glucose utilization (slope, 0-90 min, 0.27 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.09 mg/m2 X min 2; P = 0.01) in obese compared to lean subjects. In contrast, rates of activation during the low constant infusion (0.24 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.06 mg/m2 X min 2; P = 0.51) did not differ in the lean and obese subjects. Despite identical amounts of insulin, stimulation of glucose utilization was greater (P less than 0.03) during the variable than during the constant insulin infusion in the lean subjects. In contrast, stimulation during the variable and constant insulin infusions was equal in the obese subjects. These observations indicate that insulin resistance in obesity is due to a defect in the rate as well as absolute response achieved and suggest that under conditions of daily living the contribution of insulin resistance to impaired carbohydrate tolerance is greater than that previously estimated by a constant insulin infusion.\r"

Total cell-associated radioactivity was decreased in diabetic patients [2.65 +/- 1.21% (+/- SD) vs. 4.47 +/- 1.04% of total radioactivity; P less than 0.01]. Insulin internalization was also reduced in diabetic patients (34.0 +/- 6.8% vs. 59.0 +/- 11.3% of cell-associated radioactivity; P less than 0.01). Using high performance liquid chromatography six intracellular forms of radioactivity derived from A14-[125I] insulin were identified; 10-20% of intracellular radioactivity had approximately 300,000 mol wt and was identified as radioactivity bound to the insulin receptor, and the remaining intracellular radioactivity included intact A14-[125I]insulin, [125I]iodide, or [125I]tyrosine, and three intermediate compounds. A progressive reduction of intact insulin and a corresponding increase in iodine were found when the incubation time was prolonged. Intracellular insulin degradation was reduced in monocytes from diabetic patients; intracellular intact insulin was 65.6 +/- 18.1% vs. 37.4 +/- 18.0% of intracellular radioactivity (P less than 0.01) after 2 min and 23.6 +/- 22.3% vs. 3.9 +/- 2.3% (P less than 0.01) after 60 min in diabetic patients vs. normal subjects, respectively. In conclusion, 1) human monocytes internalize and degrade insulin in the intracellular compartment in a stepwise time-dependent manner; and 2) in monocytes from type II diabetic patients total cell-associated radioactivity, insulin internalization, and insulin degradation are significantly reduced. These defects may be related to the cellular insulin resistance present in these patients.\r"

Specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies binding [125I]hPTH-(1-34) were identified in the patient's serum, and positive immunohistochemical reactions were obtained when bovine parathyroid sections were exposed to the patient's IgG. After adsorption with PTH, the patient's IgG, free of anti-PTH antibodies, reacted with renal cell membranes, as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence and blocked renal PTH-dependent adenylate-cyclase activation in vitro. These results support the hypothesis that anti-PTH receptor as well as anti-PTH antibodies were generated during hPTH-(1-34) treatment, which led to the development of hypoparathyroidism when their titers were high.\r"

The iv infusion of human beta-endorphin at a dose of 0.5 mg/h for 2 h in type-2 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients (n = 12) raised plasma insulin and glucagon levels and slightly but significantly lowered plasma glucose concentrations. beta-Endorphin infusion also resulted in reappearance of a clear-cut acute insulin response to glucose, while second phase insulin release was increased and glucose disposal accelerated. Acute insulin and glucagon responses to arginine were not increased by beta-endorphin, suggesting that the effect of the opioid on the B cells of the diabetic patients is specific for glucose. An intraislet abnormality of opioid peptides action and/or secretion may play a role in the disturbances of insulin secretion in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus.\r"

Powerlifters who ingested anabolic steroids had diminished glucose tolerance compared to the nonsteroid-using group, despite having substantially higher postglucose serum insulin concentrations. Postglucose insulin responses were also higher in steroid users than in the sedentary nonobese and sedentary obese reference groups.

Plasma inactive renin was either grossly elevated or in the upper limit of the normal range in diabetic patients with autonomic dysfunction (n = 18). No correlation was found between plasma inactive renin and glycemic control, as measured by hemoglobin A1c. High plasma inactive renin levels were also found in the 4 nondiabetic patients with idiopathic autonomic dysfunction. These data suggest that increased plasma inactive renin levels in diabetic patients are a consequence of coexistent autonomic dysfunction. This finding is consistent with other evidence that suggests autonomic regulation of the processing of prorenin to renin within the kidney.\r"

The majority of the patients had no evidence of pulsatile ACTH secretion during the operation, but, rather, secreted ACTH and cortisol continuously. There was a small elevation of plasma norepinephrine and PRA which was associated with a small increase in heart rate and decrease in blood pressure. Anesthesia reversal, endotrachial extubation, and the early recovery period were associated with marked mean peak increases in plasma ACTH (173 +/- 45 pg/mL), cortisol (35 +/- 6 micrograms/dL), and epinephrine (220 +/- 56 pg/mL) and the return of plasma norepinephrine and PRA to basal levels. All hormones returned to basal levels by the first post-operative day. The data suggest that with modern anesthetic techniques patients undergoing neck surgery had mildly elevated plasma ACTH, cortisol, and epinephrine levels. Glucocorticoid secretion during the operation was maintained primarily by continuous rather than pulsatile ACTH secretion. The immediate postoperative period was associated with profound elevations of plasma ACTH, cortisol, and epinephrine. The major determinant of ACTH, cortisol, and epinephrine secretion was anesthesia reversal and recovery and not surgical trauma.\r"

  ".U": "87166589\r", 
  ".W": "We have demonstrated that metoclopramide stimulates cortisol secretion at least in part by a stress-mediated effect in normal men. To examine further the effect of the drug on the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal system, we studied the cortisol response to 20 mg metoclopramide in patients with acromegaly, prolactinomas, and functional hyperprolactinemia and compared the results with the responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. In some patients, the effects of metoclopramide on CRH-induced ACTH and cortisol increase were studied to determine whether a change in dopaminergic (catecholaminergic) activity altered CRH stimulation of pituitary-adrenal function. No cortisol response to 20 mg metoclopramide occurred in 13 tests on 8 of 9 patients with prolactinoma or acromegaly with hyperprolactinemia, whereas both acromegalic patients without hyperprolactinemia had a response. All of the patients had a normal cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Pretreatment with metoclopramide enhanced the CRH-induced cortisol increase from 30-120 min after CRH in normal men, but only at 15 and 30 min in 5 agromegalic patients. The results suggest that metoclopramide acts in the hypothalamus to release ACTH through a dopamine antagonist-mediated (catecholaminergic) mechanism, and that metoclopramide may act additively with CRH to stimulate ACTH secretion in normal men. The absence of a metoclopramide-induced cortisol response in patients with acromegaly or prolactinomas and the absence of a normal cortisol response to metoclopramide-CRH in acromegalic patients could be due to endogenous catecholamine deficiency in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of physiologic hyperinsulinemia and hyperaminoacidemia, alone or in combination, on leucine kinetics in vivo were studied in postabsorptive healthy subjects with primed-constant infusions of L-[4,5-3H]leucine and [1-14C]alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC) under euglycemic conditions. Hyperinsulinemia (approximately 100 microU/ml) decreased (P less than 0.05 vs. baseline) steady state Leucine + KIC rates of appearance (Ra) from proteolysis, KIC (approximately leucine-carbon) oxidation, and nonoxidized leucine-carbon flux (leucine----protein). Hyperaminoacidemia (plasma leucine, 210 mumol/liter), with either basal hormone replacement or combined to hyperinsulinemia, resulted in comparable increases in leucine + KIC Ra, KIC oxidation, and leucine----protein (P less than 0.05 vs. baseline). However, endogenous leucine + KIC Ra was suppressed only with the combined infusion. Therefore, on the basis of leucine kinetic data, hyperinsulinemia and hyperaminoacidemia stimulated net protein anabolism in vivo by different mechanisms. Hyperinsulinemia decreased proteolysis but did not stimulate leucine----protein. Hyperaminoacidemia per se stimulated leucine----protein but did not suppress endogenous proteolysis. When combined, they had a cumulative effect on net leucine deposition into body protein.\r"

In this study, the effects of Ab 1-15 on PMN membrane-related functions were characterized: Ab 1-15 inhibited PMN superoxide (O-2) response to FMLP by 60% (P less than 0.005) without effect on the onset or duration of O-2 production. This inhibition of O-2 response was associated with a significant inhibition of PMN chymotrypsin-like, but not trypsin-like, protease activity. Cell fractionation studies indicated the presence of an Ab 1-15 inhibitable, chymotryptic neutral protease activity in PMN membranes. In studies of Ab 1-15 effects on membrane-related second messenger pathways, Ab 1-15 augmented both FMLP- and isoproterenol-induced intracellular cAMP accumulation, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin decreased PMN cAMP response to these stimuli. Our data suggest that the function-inhibiting, anti-PMN monoclonal Ab 1-15 defines a PMN chymotryptic enzyme on the membrane surface that is involved in regulation of two membrane-related functions, O-2 generation and cAMP generation.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic renal failure (CRF) is associated with metabolic acidosis and abnormal muscle protein metabolism. As we have shown that acidosis by itself stimulates muscle protein degradation by a glucocorticoid-dependent mechanism, we assessed the contribution of acidosis to changes in muscle protein turnover in CRF. A stable model of uremia was achieved in partially nephrectomized rats (plasma urea nitrogen, 100-120 mg/dl, blood bicarbonate less than 21 meq/liter). CRF rats excreted 22% more nitrogen than pair-fed controls (P less than 0.005), so muscle protein synthesis and degradation were measured in perfused hindquarters. CRF rats had a 90% increase in net protein degradation (P less than 0.001); this was corrected by dietary bicarbonate. Correction of acidosis did not reduce the elevated corticosterone excretion rate of CRF rats, nor did it improve a second defect in muscle protein turnover, a 34% lower rate of insulin-stimulated protein synthesis. Thus, abnormal nitrogen production in CRF is due to accelerated muscle proteolysis caused by acidosis and an acidosis-independent inhibition of insulin-stimulated muscle protein synthesis.\r"

Addition of a physiologic concentration of 10(-10) M insulin to the bathing solution resulted in a stimulation of Jv and a more negative transepithelial potential difference (PD). There was a progressive stimulation of the lumen negative PD and Jv with higher insulin concentrations. Maximal stimulation occurred at 10(-8) M bath insulin. The insulin-induced stimulation of volume reabsorption was also observed when glucose and amino acids were removed from the luminal perfusate. Direct examination of the effect of insulin on glucose, chloride, and bicarbonate absorption demonstrated that the transport of all these solutes was stimulated by insulin. Addition of insulin to the luminal perfusate had no affect on Jv. These data show that insulin has a direct effect to stimulate Jv in the proximal tubule.\r"

The community, and not the family, was the basic social unit. Leprosy, an infectious disease, was not communal but strongly familial within the Karimui. Segregation analysis, to determine whether a major gene for the susceptibility to leprosy was segregating within a single multi-generational kindred, could not differentiate between a Mendelian genetic and a purely environmental hypothesis. The composite kindred data, however, suggest a genetic hypothesis for the non-immunologically induced susceptibility to leprosy per se. Within familial kindreds leprosy invariably emanated from a common ancestral sibship, and risk was associated with the closeness of kin but not with infectivity or severity.\r"

When atropine was infused, both insulin and glucagon responses to vagal stimulation were partially suppressed, whereas somatostatin release was enhanced. In the presence of hexamethonium, vagal stimulation failed to affect insulin, glucagon, or somatostatin secretion. Propranolol partially blocked both insulin and glucagon responses but did not influence somatostatin response. Phentolamine had no significant effect on release of hormones. Simultaneous administration of propranolol and phentolamine tended to inhibit both insulin and glucagon responses to vagal stimulation. These findings suggest that not only a cholinergic but also a noncholinergic neuron may be involved in vagal regulation of pancreatic hormone secretion and that these neurons may be under the control of preganglionic vagal fibers via nicotinic receptors.\r"

In comparison, the allergic rhinitics and allergic asthmatics had much higher amounts of BAL fluid histamine (113 +/- 53 and 188 +/- 42 pg/ml, respectively), and a significantly greater number of BAL fluid mast cells. Furthermore, despite having equivalent baseline pulmonary function values, allergic asthmatics with BAL fluid histamine levels greater than 100 pg/ml required only 7 +/- 2 breath units of methacholine to induce a 20% drop in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (PD20FEV1) while asthmatics with BAL fluid histamine levels less than 100 pg/ml required 49 +/- 19 breath units (P less than 0.05).

We used tissue culture cells and isogenic derivatives of a proline auxotrophic strain of E. coli that were fimbriated (Fim+) or nonfimbriated (Fim-), and were heat-labile enterotoxin producing (Tox+) or toxin nonproducing (Tox-). We found that the Fim+ bacteria; which were capable of adhering to tissue culture cells, initiated growth much sooner than did nonadherent Fim- bacteria; the adherent bacteria used tissue cell-derived proline, which was available at high concentrations only in the zone of bacterial adherence. Likewise, cyclic AMP secreted by adherent (Fim+) bacteria was maintained at high concentration on the tissue cell surfaces. As few as 2 X 10(5) adherent Fim+ Tox+ bacteria exert toxic activity upon Y1 adrenal cells, whereas toxin secreted in the medium by 6 X 10(6) Fim- Tox+ bacteria was undetectable. The results suggest that the growth advantage and enhanced toxicity of adherent E. coli is due to restricted diffusion of products secreted by the tissue culture and bacterial cells, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Of 149 subjects with androgenetic alopecia, 102 completed 1 year of a double-blind, randomized study comparing 2% minoxidil and 3% minoxidil solutions for safety and efficacy. One third of the subjects used a vehicle placebo for the first 4 months and then switched to 3% minoxidil. At 12 months the 2% minoxidil group switched to a 3% solution. During months 5 to 12 a steady increase in terminal hair counts occurred to an equal degree within the 2% and 3% minoxidil groups and the 3% treatment group switched from placebo. Total hair counts at 12 months increased from a baseline mean of 63.5 to 180.6 in the 2% treatment group, from 61.0 to 179.9 in the 3% group, and from 65.0 to 191.1 in the placebo to 3% crossover group. Although all 102 subjects completing 12 months of the study thought that visible hair growth had resulted, 89 were considered by the investigators to have visible growth. Dense hair growth, defined as hair long enough to cut or comb, was present in 48 subjects by their own evaluation and in 33 subjects by investigator evaluation. There were no serious side effects. Two instances of allergic contact dermatitis and four of pruritus were attributed to use of the drug. Two individuals complained of impotence, which disappeared within a few days of discontinuation of topical minoxidil. This effect has not been reported during the use of minoxidil in its oral form (Loniten) for the treatment of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Initially these men were treated with either twice-daily 2% topical minoxidil for 12 months or 3% topical minoxidil for 8 to 12 months (one third of the subjects received placebo for the first 4 months). After 12 months all subjects continued to apply 3% topical minoxidil twice daily for 1 more year, after which they were randomized to once- versus twice-daily topical minoxidil for an additional 9 months. Those subjects who changed to once-daily application of topical minoxidil at 2 years had a mean change from baseline nonvellus hair count at 1 year of 291.2 (range of hairs four to 553) and at 2 years 9 months of 235 (two to 592 hairs). Those subjects who continued with twice-daily application of topical minoxidil throughout the study had a mean change from baseline nonvellus hair count at 1 year of 323 (15 to 589 hairs) and 335 (13 to 808 hairs) at 2 years 9 months with maintenance topical minoxidil. There were subjects on both maintenance schedules of topical minoxidil who lost some of the nonvellus hair they had initially gained with topical minoxidil; however, there was a greater mean loss in those patients following the once-daily versus twice-daily topical minoxidil regimen (p = 0.05). No subject lost nonvellus target hair as compared with baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, a gross visual estimate of the degree of new hair growth over the entire balding area was made independently by the investigator and the patient. At the end of 4 months there was significant regrowth of nonvellus (terminal and indeterminate) hairs in the patients using the 2% and 3% solutions (p = 0.0001).

One hundred fifty men with a discernible vertex balding spot were randomly assigned to treatment with either 2% topical minoxidil, 3% topical minoxidil, or placebo. After 4 months, patients receiving placebo were crossed over to 3% minoxidil. The study was concluded after 12 months of treatment, at which time 100 subjects were evaluable. Efficacy was determined primarily by objective hair counts at monthly intervals and by subjective patient evaluations at 4 and 12 months. Patients applying active medication had significantly greater growth of nonvellus hairs at 4 months than did their placebo counterparts (p = 0.0018 for 2% minoxidil vs placebo; p = 0.0167 for 3% minoxidil vs placebo). In patients crossed over from placebo to 3% minoxidil, the rate of growth of nonvellus hairs increased to fifteen hairs a month during the next 4 months and slowed to ten hairs a month during the last 4 months. Within-group analyses for month 12 evaluable patients demonstrated significant increases in total hair counts for all three groups (p less than or equal to 0.0001). According to investigator evaluations at month 12, 82% of the 2% minoxidil group, 78% of the 3% minoxidil group, and 83% of the placebo to 3% minoxidil group had new hair growth. Clinically insignificant minoxidil blood levels resulted from scalp absorption. Thirty-six medical events in twenty-six patients were deemed related to the study drug; twenty-seven of these events were dermatologic in nature, and all were mild and self-limiting.\r"

One of the subjects who was using extemporaneous topical minoxidil had hypertension and arteriosclerotic disease and the other died of a myocardial infarction.

A dose-response effect was demonstrated when 48 patients treated with topical 1% minoxidil were compared with 47 patients treated with topical 5% minoxidil. A total of 66 patients were enrolled, 26 of them participating in both study groups. Patients with extensive (75% or greater) scalp hair loss showed a response rate of 38%, defined as terminal hair regrowth, with 1% minoxidil versus an 81% response rate with 5% minoxidil. The current 2% formulation is most likely to elicit cosmetically acceptable regrowth in those with patchy alopecia areata. Occlusion of the treated area appears to be necessary to achieve and maintain maximum results. Nonresponders are most likely to be found among those with the most extensive scalp hair loss. No other clinical features correlate with response to treatment. However, a finding of increased T cell blastogenesis before treatment may predict response. In patients with severe alopecia areata, hair loss generally recurs after treatment is stopped and may recur during treatment. Systemic absorption of topically applied and occluded minoxidil solutions (1% and 5%) was minimal; no clinically significant changes in blood pressure, weight, cardiovascular status, electrocardiogram, electrolytes, complete blood count, or urinalysis were seen. Mild local irritation occurred, and two of the 66 patients developed allergic contact dermatitis to minoxidil, as confirmed by patch tests.\r"

The present multicenter study was designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of sustained (48 hour) intravenous infusions of different doses of milrinone, as would be used clinically, in a controlled fashion using invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Entry was limited to adult patients with chronic heart failure of functional class III or IV, with a cardiac index less than or equal to 2.5 liters/min per m2 or a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater than or equal to 15 mm Hg, or both. After stable baseline hemodynamic recordings were obtained, milrinone was given as loading (microgram/kg per 10 min) and maintenance infusions (microgram/kg per min) to 189 patients in one of four loading/maintenance dosage regimens: 37.5/0.375 (low dose, n = 26), 50/0.50 (intermediate dose, n = 95), 75/0.75 (high dose, n = 15) and 50/0.25 (lowest dose, n = 53). The lowest dose was shown to be ineffective for maintenance therapy. Effective individual patient responses were defined as greater than or equal to 20% increase in cardiac index or decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, or both. During early therapy (less than or equal to 3 hour), 99% of patients showed an effective maximal response, and 90% an effective mean response. An effective mean response was observed during days 1 and 2 in 80% of patients, with a positive dose-response trend (69% response, low dose; 80%, intermediate dose; 93%, high dose; day 1). Each loading regimen was effective, with maximal mean response occurring at 15 minutes. Cardiac index initially increased by an average of 24 to 42% for all patients in the three groups, whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased by 24 to 33%. Initial decreases in systemic vascular resistance averaged 15 to 31%. Initial changes in heart rate (+4 to +13%) and mean arterial pressure (-2 to -13%) were modest. Significant mean hemodynamic responses were maintained over the 48 hours. Increases in cardiac index for days 1 and 2 averaged 38 and 39% for those completing constant low dose drug, 34 and 37% for intermediate dose and 73 and 44% for high dose. Decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure for all patients averaged 18 to 32% on days 1 and 2, with little dose response. Heart rate changes were modest and variable, averaging -9 to 9%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87167151\r", 
  ".W": "To identify specific histologic abnormalities that could predict early cardiac rejection before the development of myocyte necrosis, 167 consecutive endomyocardial biopsy samples from 18 cardiac transplant recipients were retrospectively analyzed and 17 histologic variables were semiquantitatively graded from 0 to 3. Forty-five biopsy samples contained foci of myocyte necrosis and were labeled Rejectors. The two samples immediately preceding Rejector biopsies were labeled Predictors (n = 44). All remaining samples were labeled Others (n = 78). Endocardial and interstitial infiltrates, interstitial mononuclear cells, pyroninophilic mononuclear cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other cells (eosinophils and plasma cells) were significantly increased in graded severity in Rejector biopsy samples as compared with Predictors or Others (p less than 0.001, ANOVA testing). These variables cannot distinguish Predictor biopsy specimens from Others. On the other hand, interstitial edema, perivascular karyorrhexis and perivascular infiltrate with intermyocyte extension are histologic abnormalities that can distinguish Predictor biopsy samples from Others (p less than 0.001, ANOVA testing). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicates that the relative risk of developing myocyte necrosis when a biopsy sample contains interstitial edema is 8.1. With perivascular infiltrate with intermyocyte extension in addition, the relative risk is 41.4. In summary, three histologic abnormalities have been identified that help predict the future development of myocyte necrosis within the next two endomyocardial biopsies. Biopsy specimens with these abnormalities probably represent early cardiac rejection before the development of myocyte necrosis.\r"

  ".U": "87167156\r", 
  ".W": "Although initial success rates for coronary angioplasty have improved, the rate of restenosis within 6 months of the procedure has persisted at 30 to 40%. The relation of restenosis to initial success, recurrence of symptoms and risk factors suggests that high grade or total lesions, long lesions, lesions in the proximal left anterior descending artery or in saphenous grafts, and the absence of intimal dissection after angioplasty are associated with an increased risk of restenosis. Unstable angina, male sex and diabetes are clinical factors associated with a greater risk of restenosis. Pathologic specimens suggest that plaque splitting and disruption are found acutely after angioplasty, but that restenosis occurs as an excessive reparative, proliferative response of smooth muscle cells leading to recurrent luminal narrowing. A prospective analysis of therapeutic interventions to prevent restenosis, such as administering antiplatelet and lipid-lowering agents, intensive diabetic therapy and administration of calcium antagonists, is proposed. Problems with timing of studies, design and sample size are considered. Current recommendations for anti-restenosis therapy include antiplatelet therapy before and after angioplasty, administration of heparin in some patients and intensive risk factor intervention for the 6 months after the procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Many studies have been performed to evaluate the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy in achieving reperfusion, salvaging myocardium and enhancing survival. This review discusses the concordance between the results of these clinical studies and the observations made in experimental animals of the effect of reperfusion on the recovery of left ventricular function. The evaluation of functional recovery is affected by the timing of the measurement and the sensitivity of the method for detecting regional abnormalities. In addition, the underlying coronary anatomy also determines outcome, so that infarct location, collateral circulation and the degree of coronary obstruction merit consideration. Two factors are of paramount importance in determining the amount of myocardium salvaged, the recovery of left ventricular function and the reduction in mortality. These factors are: the time delay until reperfusion is achieved and the adequacy of the coronary reflow. The close agreement between studies measuring the effect of reperfusion on left ventricular function and studies with mortality as the end point provides indirect evidence that enhancement of survival in patients treated with thrombolytic agents is mediated by recovery of ventricular function.\r"

The patient was indirectly exposed to this dust by her husband, a chemist working in a pharmaceutical plant in which VA is used for the production of vinburnine, an alkaloid derivative. Vinburnine (Cervoxan) is widely used in conditions associated with cerebral circulatory insufficiency. Studies revealed the presence of immediate skin test reactivity to VA dust, and specific anti-VA antibodies were detected in the patient's serum by the reverse enzyme immunoassay technique. Bronchial challenge with a VA extract also resulted in an immediate asthmatic response without late reaction. These findings suggest a type I IgE-mediated immunologic mechanism as being responsible for the patient's respiratory symptoms. Unexposed persons did not exhibit reactivity to this seed with any of the tests referred to above. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of occupational asthma caused by VA seeds.\r"

Thirty-six adult patients with watery rhinorrhea as a dominant symptom completed the study, which consisted of a 2-week run-in period followed by two 3-week treatment periods with placebo and ipratropium in an ordinary dosage (80 micrograms four times a day) in a double-blind, crossover design, and, finally, an open 2-week period with high-dose therapy (400 micrograms four times a day). The number of nose blowings was 47% lower during treatment with ipratropium in the ordinary dosage than during the placebo period (p less than 0.001). There was an additional reduction during high-dose therapy that was slight but statistically significant (p less than 0.05). Ipratropium had no effect on the number of sneezes or on nasal blockage index. During ordinary-dose therapy, side effects were slight and confined to the nose, whereas the high-dose therapy caused unpleasant nasal dryness and, in a few cases, systemic side effects. It was not possible to separate responders from nonresponders by case history, physical examination, or nasal methacholine testing. It is concluded that intranasal ipratropium is effective in the treatment of watery rhinorrhea in perennial nonallergic rhinitis and that 320 micrograms a day is sufficient in most patients.\r"

In the Aspergillus RAST, there was little or no inhibition with Cladosporium and Alternaria, but considerable cross-reactivity was found between Alternaria and Cladosporium. Inhibition by Alternaria of the Cladosporium RAST was found in a dose-dependent fashion in one serum, whereas all four sera in the Alternaria RAST were inhibited by Cladosporium in this fashion. Logit transformation of the Alternaria RAST-inhibition curves produced common slopes with Alternaria and Cladosporium in three of the four sera, indicating their immunologic identity. The immunoblot technique confirmed the degree of cross-reactivity found by RAST inhibition among the molds. This evidence of common allergenic determinants in these fungi could help to explain the observation that mold-allergic patients often have skin test reactions to several fungi.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that treatment with an inhaled anti-inflammatory drug (i.e., budesonide) but not with an inhaled beta-agonist (i.e., terbutaline) would reduce BR in children with asthma and with minimal or no bronchoconstriction. Twelve patients were treated with budesonide and seven with terbutaline for 6 months. BR decreased in 11 patients receiving budesonide and was significant in seven patients. BR decreased in none of the patients receiving terbutaline. FEV1 demonstrated a small increase with budesonide but remained unchanged with terbutaline. Except in one patient who received terbutaline, the clinical effect was good. We conclude that inhaled corticosteroids but not inhaled beta-agonists will decrease persistent BR in most children with asthma.\r"

Six male subjects with asthma who developed both UNDW-induced bronchoconstriction and refractoriness after UNDW were studied on 3 separate days, 1 week apart. On each study day, subjects had an initial UNDW challenge. UNDW responsiveness was assessed with dose-response curves of UNDW volume output versus the percent fall in FEV1. The output provoking a 20% fall in FEV1 (PO20 UNDW) was calculated. FEV1 was measured again at 5-minute intervals until it returned to within 5% of baseline value. UNDW challenge was then repeated. On day 1, the two successive UNDW challenges were performed in absence of any treatment (control day). Before days 2 and 3, subjects received placebo capsules or indomethacin, 100 mg per day, in a double-blind, randomized fashion for 3 days. On both the control and placebo days, repeated UNDW inhalation provoked a significant increase in PO20 UNDW (p less than 0.01), indicating refractoriness. On the indomethacin day, the mean PO20 UNDW during the second UNDW challenge was not significantly different from that obtained during the initial test on that day (p greater than 0.05), indicating that refractoriness did not occur. We suggest that inhibitory prostaglandins are involved in the development of refractoriness after UNDW inhalation.\r"

To address this question, we performed a randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled study of daily multivitamin supplementation in 101 noninstitutionalized ambulatory elderly persons (median age, 64 years). Vitamin levels were assayed at baseline, and at two and four months of supplementation. At four months, those taking multivitamins had statistically significant increased levels of water soluble vitamins (C, B2, B12, plasma, and erythrocyte folate) that were greater than changes noted for the placebo group. This was not true for fat soluble vitamins A and E. Greater storage pools of fat soluble vitamins help explain this discrepancy. We conclude that in the ambulatory elderly, oral multivitamins can raise levels of water soluble vitamins but the effect on fat soluble vitamins remains uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "The nonpathological age-related changes in the dopamine- and serotonin-containing neurotransmitter systems in human and rodent brain are reviewed. The dopamine system exhibits age-related declines both presynaptically and postsynaptically. Presynaptically, both the levels of dopamine and the number of midbrain dopamine-containing neurons decline by up to 50% at advanced ages in the absence of neurological disease. Postsynaptically, the density of D-2 dopamine receptors decreases by 40%, while D-1 dopamine receptors either increase (man) or remain stable (rodents). Additional reductions of dopamine levels and D-2 receptors have been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but these changes are relatively small, and not consistently observed. The levels of serotonin appear stable during normal aging, and presynaptic markers such as (3H)imipramine binding may actually increase. In human brain, the two major classes of serotonin receptor (S-1 and S-2) decrease by 30 to 50% over the lifespan. In AD, both presynaptic and postsynaptic markers of the serotonin system are reduced, including a loss of the serotonin-containing raphe neurons. The additional loss of serotonin receptors in AD approaches 80% when compared with young normals. A hypothesis is presented to explain the typically young age at onset of schizophrenia (usually before 30 years of age) and the older age at onset of parkinsonism (rarely before 50 years of age) within the context of normal age-related declines in the dopamine system occurring in the absence of neurological disorders. The possibility that chronic cocaine abuse might accelerate the development of parkinsonism is discussed.\r"

The tumor demonstrated an aggressive histologic pattern and stained immunohistochemically for alpha-fetoprotein and beta-subunit human chorionic gonadotrophin. After a successful liver transplant these tumor markers were closely followed. We conclude that histologic subclassification of hepatoblastoma is most useful for predicting likelihood of resectability. Tumors with predominantly fetal-type histology tend to be better circumscribed and are more likely to be resectable with improved survival relative to tumors with predominantly embryonal histology. The presence or absence of mesenchymal elements does not seem to have prognostic importance. Anaplastic features predict a poor outcome, but it remains for these to be uniformly defined and applied. Small uniform cellular histology with neuroblastoma-like differentiation appears to be particularly ominous. Serologic tumor markers, especially alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) are useful as monitors of potential tumor recurrence, but their efficacy is compromised by the unpredictable variation of tumor cell metabolism, undoubtedly a result of the genetic instability and heterogeneity of proliferating malignant cells.\r"

Patients were randomized before therapy within strata defined by whether they had received oral corticosteroids continuously before the study (group A, 35 patients) or not (group B, 31 patients). Comparisons were made between groups receiving what we considered optimal corticoid therapy, hydrocortisone for group A and ACTH for group B. Overall, therapeutic success was achieved in 28 (42%), with a median time of 7.5 days. Favorable factors measured on admission to the study were those suggesting less severe colitis activity: absence of fulminant disease, limited disease extent, a shorter duration of the present attack, fewer stools, a lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and a higher hemoglobin. Factors compatible with more severe colitis including fulminant activity, more extensive disease, a shorter total disease duration, bloody stools, and fewer bowel movements, favored an early response among those patients who were to achieve a remission. Prolonging therapy beyond 10 days by switching to the alternate corticoid drug did not improve the remission rate. Achieving remission during the initial therapy period, especially when it occurred early, was the most important predictive factor for a favorable clinical course during the following year. Prolonging therapy did not improve the 1-year remission rate. In fact, a higher proportion of patients who continued to require therapy underwent colectomy than those who received one treatment course.\r"

Understanding the principles of laser physics to apply laser techniques correctly is not difficult. Currently, the laser is used for control of gastrointestinal hemorrhage and for debulking obstructing tumors in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Hemostasis has been achieved in 70-100% of patients with a variety of bleeding lesions. Specific laser techniques vary in the power used and exposure time, but some standardization has been agreed on. Obstructing gastrointestinal neoplasms may now be safely and effectively ablated to achieve patency of the lumen. Perforation from laser therapy occurs in 1% or less of patients treated, making this a reasonably safe form of treatment. The high cost of laser unit (approximately $85,000) and the availability of equally effective and more reasonably priced alternatives require careful attention to the cost-effectiveness of the laser. Training physicians in the safe use of lasers is a problem that still must be solved by the users and instrument makers.\r"

By contrast, dendritic cells could not be detected in cultures of cells obtained from patients with Bruton's type agammaglobulinemia that lacked B cells. Cells with dendritic morphology were nonspecific esterase negative and not phagocytic. They expressed HLA-DR, DQ, and DP antigens, receptors for interleukin 2 and transferrin, and were stained by B1 and 60.3, an antibody that identifies the beta-chain common to lymphocyte function associated antigen-1, complement receptor 3, and the p150,95 antigen, but not by monoclonal antibodies to monocytes, complement receptors 2 or 3, NK cells, T cells, or Langerhans' cells. Formation of dendritic cells was inhibited by microtubule poisons (vinblastine, colchicine), a microfilament inhibitor (cytochalasin B), and the 60.3 monoclonal antibody, but not by inhibition of DNA synthesis. These data indicate that a subset of B cells is capable of assuming dendritic morphology after stimulation with phorbol esters and attachment to a surface. These dendritic cells exhibit characteristics that are quite similar to the interdigitating cells found in T cell-dependent areas of lymph nodes.\r"

  ".W": "Three anti-H-2Ld and two anti-H-2Dd monoclonal alloantibodies were analyzed for their capacity to enhance skin graft and neonatal heart graft survival. Of two anti-H-2Ld antibodies with the same specificity but with different isotypes, IgG2a antibody 30-5-7S prolonged graft survival in a skin graft combination with an Ld difference, whereas IgM antibodies did not. A second IgG2a antibody, but with a specificity different from 30-5-7S, was ineffective on its own. However, when mixed with 30-5-7S, skin graft survival was augmented as compared with the prolongation by 30-5-7S alone. Enhancement by anti-H-2Ld antibodies was dependent on the extent of the H-2 graft barrier. It was abrogated on extension of the graft barrier to a D-end H-2 difference by using the B10.A----B10.BR combination. Also, anti-Dd antibodies, either alone or in combination with anti-Ld, were ineffective in this skin graft combination. By using the same graft combination but the less immunogenic neonatal heart graft model, anti-Ld antibodies were still ineffective, but both anti-Dd antibodies were able to enhance graft survival from 15 to 22 days. When mixed with anti-Ld antibody 30-5-7S, graft survival was augmented further to 30 days. These results indicate that two kinds of enhancing alloantibodies may be distinguished. One category interacts with immunodominant epitopes on H-2 molecules, but their effectiveness may be limited to a particular H-2 difference, because immunodominance may vary from one graft barrier to another. In the second category, antibodies are ineffective on their own but they are able to potentiate the effects of antibodies of the first kind. These allocations are relative, however, because they are dependent on the type of graft examined.\r"

To investigate the effect of the host microenvironment on these genetically donor T cells, mixed leukocyte cultures were carried out. Unfractionated mononuclear cells (MNC) from eight infants with SCID immunologically reconstituted by haploidentical bone marrow stem cells responded in the same pattern as MNC from non-chimeric individuals to autologous and allogeneic irradiated MNC, even though they contained all genetically donor T cells and all genetically patient B cells and monocytes. This included surprisingly vigorous proliferative responses of the patients' MNC to the original donors' irradiated MNC. This autoreactivity could be detected as soon as T cell function appeared post-transplantation and appeared to increase with time. It could be blocked by the addition of monoclonal antibodies to HLA Class II antigens. Responses of most patients' MNC were similar whether stimulated by irradiated MNC from the donor or non-donor parent or by those from unrelated normal controls. Purified genetically donor T cells that had matured from stem cells in the patient's microenvironment responded vigorously to purified donor B cells. These same cells responded much less to patient B cells. In six cases, such genetically donor T cells responded less to patient B cells than fresh donor T cells did to donor B cells in the autologous mixed leukocyte response. By contrast, T cells of donor karyotype from three of the patients responded more vigorously to donor B cells than fresh donor T cells did. Thus, genetically donor T lymphocytes that had matured from stem cells in the recipient microenvironment behaved differently from those that had matured in the donor. The hyporesponsiveness of genetically donor T cells from the patient to patient B cells does not appear to be due to T suppressor cells.\r"

To determine whether cell motility is concomitant with growth factor action in T lymphocytes, we measured the chemotactic activity of porcine insulin (10(-11) to 10(-5) M) for T lymphocytes. We found that the chemotactic response of human T cells activated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) to porcine insulin was increased over that of resting T cells, with a concomitant two log leftward shift in the dose response. CD4+ and CD8+ subsets responded identically. Checkerboard analysis showed insulin to be chemotactic, as well as chemokinetic. The nature and time course of acquisition of the dose-response shift suggest that chemotaxis may be signaled by insulin acting on high affinity insulin receptors. The chemotactic effect of insulin exemplifies the general chemotactic effect of growth factors for motile target cells, and may be a useful model for the study of chemotactic signaling in T lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that marked enhancement of the in vitro binding of lymphocytes to endothelial cell (EC) monolayers is observed after stimulation of the EC with interleukin 1 (IL 1). To determine whether new protein synthesis was required for this effect of IL 1, EC were incubated with IL 1 in the presence of cycloheximide or puromycin. Three different effects of these protein synthesis inhibitors on T-EC binding were observed. First, preincubation of the EC with both IL 1 and an inhibitor blocked the increase in binding if the inhibitor was present during both the preincubation and the 1 hr duration of the T-EC binding assay, suggesting that new protein synthesis is required for the enhancement of T-EC adhesion by IL 1. Second, preincubation of the EC with low doses of the inhibitors (0.1 to 1 microgram/ml) in the absence of IL 1 consistently increased T-EC binding, even if the inhibitors were present during the T-EC adhesion assay; in addition, the inhibitors additionally increased the stimulatory effect of IL 1 if the EC were washed free of the inhibitor before the assay step. The binding-enhancing effect of low concentrations of cycloheximide could be inhibited by an antibody to the CDw18 complex on the T cell, suggesting an up-regulation of the ligand on the EC involved in CDw18-dependent T cell adhesion. Third, higher concentrations of the inhibitors (3 to 10 micrograms/ml) were toxic for the EC in the presence of IL 1, possibly due to the combined blocking effect of IL 1 and inhibitors on EC protein synthesis.\r"

Carnoy's fluid-fixed cytocentrifuge preparations of enriched populations of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils showed no reactivity with anti-tryptase antibodies by a sensitive indirect immunoperoxidase procedure. Dispersed human lung mast cells showed strong granular cytoplasmic staining with both antibodies, whereas only approximately 50% of the peripheral blood basophils detectable with Wright's stain were detected with anti-tryptase antibodies, and these showed a staining pattern that was faint, granular, and cytoplasmic at high concentrations of antibody. At lower antibody concentrations mast cell staining was still intense, whereas basophils were not stained. Extracts of neutrophils and lymphocytes of up to 90% purity had undetectable amounts of tryptase by an ELISA sandwich immunoassay, as well as undetectable enzymatic activity with tosyl-L-gly-pro-lys-p-nitroanilide (a sensitive substrate for tryptase) in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Extracts of basophil-enriched (6 to 50% purity) preparations contained 0.046 +/- 0.013 pg of tryptase per basophil by the immunoassay along with 2 X 10(-9) +/- 0.8 X 10(-9) U of tryptase-like enzyme activity per basophil, compared with corresponding values of 12 pg, 480 X 10(-9) U of tryptase per human lung mast cell. Thus very small amounts of tryptase are present in human basophils (approximately 0.4% of that found in mast cells), but not in other peripheral leukocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Murine, rat, rabbit and guinea pig class I heavy chains, which do not react with W6/32 monoclonal antibody when they are expressed in association with autologous beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m), can acquire such a reactivity once they are expressed at the surface of cells cultured in conditions which allow their association with bovine beta 2-m. Sequence comparison of beta 2-ms suggests that glutamine at position 89 might be critical for the induction of the W6/32 defined antigenic determinant. However, in the murine species, certain class I heavy chains, in spite of their association with bovine beta 2-m, do not express this determinant. Using genetically engineered hybrid class I molecules and selected congenic strains of mice this negative property was shown to be related to the presence of a cysteine residue at position 121 which allows covalent association of beta 2-m to class I heavy chains (Bushkin, Y., J-S. Tung, A. Pinter, J. Michaelson, and E. A. Boyse. 1986. Unusual association of beta 2-microglobulin with certain class I heavy chains of the murine major histocompatibility complex. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:432). Therefore, expression of the W6/32 defined antigenic determinant implicates both the beta 2-m and the second domain of the heavy chain, but its expression (or exposure) is prevented by the covalent fixation on cysteine 121 of the light chain.\r"

The latter included the anti-HLA-A2, A28 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) CR11-351, the MoAb Q6/64 to a determinant restricted to HLA-B antigens and the MoAb CR10-215 and CR11-115 to the same (or spatially close) monomorphic determinant. Anti-idiotypic antibodies could be detected in bleedings obtained 3 days after the first booster, increased in titer in bleedings obtained after the second booster, and persisted at high levels in subsequent bleedings. The four anti-HLA class I MoAb did not differ in their ability to elicit syngeneic anti-idiotypic antibodies. Cross-blocking studies with a panel of anti-HLA class I, anti-HLA class II, and anti-human melanoma-associated antigen (MAA) MoAb showed that the anti-MoAb CR10-215 and anti-MoAb CR11-115 antisera contain only antibodies to private idiotopes, whereas the anti-HLA MoAb CR11-351 and anti-MoAb Q6/64 antisera also contain antibodies to public idiotopes. The latter are expressed by the anti-HLA class I MoAb CR11-351, Q1/28, Q6/64, and 6/31, and by the anti-HLA class II MoAb Q5/6, Q5/13, 127, and 441. Public idiotopes were not detected on the nine anti-MAA MoAb tested. Public idiotopes do not interfere with the binding of anti-HLA MoAb with the corresponding antigenic determinants. On the other hand private idiotopes are located within the antigen-combining site, because anti-idiotypic antisera specifically inhibit the binding of the corresponding immunizing anti-HLA class I MoAb to cultured human lymphoid cells in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis by isoelectric focusing of the anti-HLA class I MoAb antisera showed that the spectrotype of the anti-MoAb CR11-351 antiserum comprises four components that focus in the pH 6.9 to 6.2 range, the spectrotype of anti-MoAb Q6/64 antiserum comprises three components that focus in the pH 6.5 to 6.1 range, the spectrotype of the anti-MoAb CR10-215 antiserum comprises three components that focus in the pH 6.4 to 6.1 range, and the spectrotype of the anti-MoAb CR11-115 antiserum comprises three components that focus in the pH 6.6 to 6.4 range.\r"

  ".U": "87167574\r", 
  ".W": "Although monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can elicit potent ADCC by human K lymphocytes, different mAb, even of the same antibody subclass or even of the same target antigen specificity, vary considerably as to their efficiency in eliciting ADCC. The extensive variability in ADCC efficiencies of murine IgG2a mAb is analyzed here. In cold-target inhibition experiments it was found that only cells coated with \"ADCC-efficient\" IgG2a mAb, and not \"ADCC-inefficient\" IgG2a mAb, inhibit K effector cell lysis of radiolabeled target cells by ADCC. This result indicates that the spatial orientation of the antibodies on the target cell membrane influences the net efficiency of ADCC reactions by affecting the efficiency of interaction between antibody and the Fc receptors (FcR) of K cells. It is proposed that a \"favorable\" orientation of antibodies on the target cell membrane is required for efficient ADCC reactions. This proposal is directly supported by the observation that one IgG2a mAb (20.8.4), which cross-reacts with several different H-2 alloantigens, was found to elicit efficient ADCC only when bound to certain of its possible target cell antigens. It was also observed in these studies that the organization of antibodies on a target cell membrane influences the net efficiency of ADCC reactions. It is proposed that a \"favorable\" antibody organization on the target cell membrane is also required for efficient ADCC reactions. This proposal is supported by the observation that certain antihuman beta 2m (anti-Hu beta 2m) IgG2a mAb, which elicit efficient ADCC lysis of human target cells, fail to elicit the lysis of murine cells having Hu beta 2m molecules coupled randomly to their external membrane surfaces. The differences in the way the Hu beta 2m was organized on the surfaces of the human cells and the murine-Hu beta 2m cell conjugates presumably caused differences in the way the bound antibodies were organized on the cell surfaces, which in turn resulted in the ADCC efficiency differences observed for the same mAb with the different target cell types. Because ADCC reactions appear to be sensitive to both the orientation and the organization of cell surface-bound antibodies, certain types of structural alterations or variations in the membrane molecules (relative to other neighboring structures on the target cell membrane) are potentially detectable by quantitative differences or variations in ADCC reactions.\r"

Major immunoreactive bands of 45, 50, and 116 kd were found in both lung and tissue culture-derived rat P. carinii, suggesting the organism retains its antigenic characteristics in short-term culture. The principal immunoreactive bands in human P. carinii included a band of 40 kd, and to a lesser extent, a band of 66 kd; these antigens were found in the lungs of six and seven AIDS patients but in only one of eight non-AIDS patients with pneumocystosis. The rat and human P. carinii antigens reacted with sera from immunized rabbits, from rats with pneumocystosis and prolonged environmental exposure to the organism, from AIDS and non-AIDS P. carinii patients, and from healthy blood donors. Reactivity of these antigens could be removed by adsorption of antisera with P. carinii-infected lungs but not with normal lungs or lungs infected with bacteria and fungi. We conclude that rat and human P. carinii have shared, as well as species-specific, antigenic determinants, which should be useful for a variety of studies with this organism.\r"

Subsequently, the virus was quickly eliminated, being below detectability usually by day 10. During the time of virus clearance, the mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) of the spleen were activated as revealed by suppression of growth of Listeria monocytogenes and increase of cell-associated hydrolytic enzymes. In athymic nude mice, in whom the MNP system is assumed to be permanently activated, the virus replicated slightly but reproducibly less than in their euthymic counterparts. However, when the MNP were activated by Corynebacterium parvum, virus in spleens attained higher concentrations than in mice not so treated, and the rate of elimination was not altered. In mice whose MNP had been damaged by injection of dextran sulfate 500, the spleen virus titers were also increased, but the subsequent immune elimination was slightly delayed. Activation of spleen MNP was not evident at the time virus was rapidly cleared as a result of transfusion of LCM-immune T lymphocytes. Adoptive immunization was as successful in mice that had been pretreated with gamma-rays or cyclophosphamide, suggesting that replicating cells or their descendants, in particular monocytes, did not participate measurably in the process of elimination. Pretreatments of recipients with dextran sulfate 500 reduced the efficacy of transfused LCM-immune T lymphocytes, but this compound probably directly affected the cells. We interpret these findings to mean that the LCM virus in the mouse's spleen is controlled by a mechanism in which MNP do not play an essential role.\r"

We have investigated whether these transferred lymphocytes remain subject to continued clonal selection and subsequently became memory B cells even in the initial absence of T cells. Twenty-eight donor/recipient pairs were randomized pretransplant to be immunized or not with tetanus toxoid (TT). The recipients were then vaccinated with TT at 3, 6, and 12 mo posttransplant, and the anti-TT antibody response (IgG and IgM) was measured. Only when both donor and recipient were immunized pretransplant could the recipient respond to antigen challenge within the first year posttransplant. Examination of the spectrotype pattern of the recipient anti-TT antibody shows that selection of B cell clones continues, so that T cell depletion does not prevent the appearance of oligoclonal antibody responses. However, because the spectrotype pattern of the recipient did not match the donors, B cell regulatory mechanisms in donor and recipient are nonidentical. These data contrast with observations made in recipients of non-T cell-depleted marrow and serve to illustrate the role of T lymphocytes in the induction and regulation of secondary antibody responses in man. The results also suggest that optimal humoral responses to any antigen after T cell depletion can only occur when both donor and recipient are immunized pretransplant, a prediction borne out by studies on the influence of donor cytomegalovirus status on the severity of cytomegalovirus infection in the recipient.\r"

Consistent with previous immunohistochemical results, extracts of T mast cells, the predominant mast cell type in lung (93% T and 7% TC mast cells), were deficient in human chymase (less than 0.3 microgram and 0.04 U/10(6) mast cells) but not tryptase (10.8 micrograms and 0.3 U/10(6) mast cells) by corresponding immunologic and enzymatic (suc-L-ala-ala-pro-phe-p-nitroanilide in the presence of aprotinin and tosyl-L-gly-pro-lys-p-nitroanilide in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor, respectively) assays. The minor presence of chymase activity in lung could be accounted for by the minor presence of lung TC mast cells. Extracts of TC mast cells, the predominant mast cell type (1% T and 99% TC mast cells) in foreskin, contained both proteases. However, TC mast cells from adult foreskin contained eightfold to 10-fold higher levels of chymase (4.5 micrograms and 1.01 U/10(6) mast cells) and twofold to threefold higher levels of tryptase (11.5 micrograms and 0.27 U/10(6) mast cells) than did TC mast cells from newborn foreskin (less than 0.6 microgram and 0.09 U of chymase and 35 micrograms and 0.62 U of tryptase/10(6) mast cells). In contrast, histamine levels were not significantly different in adult foreskin TC (1.9 microgram/10(6) mast cells), newborn foreskin TC (1.6 microgram/10(6) mast cells), and adult lung T (1.5 microgram/10(6) mast cells) mast cells. The relative ratio of each mediator in newborn foreskin mast cells to that in adult foreskin mast cells is highest for histamine, followed by tryptase and then chymase. Tryptase from TC and T mast cells had identical subunit compositions by Western blot analysis and similar apparent specific activities. This study extends the previously reported immunohistochemical distinction between human T and TC mast cells in tissue sections by direct quantitation of chymase and tryptase in dispersed preparations of T and TC mast cells.\r"

  ".W": "Directed migration of monocytes is dependent upon interaction of cell surface receptors and specific chemotactic ligands. To determine whether circulating human monocytes express multiple chemotactic ligand receptors or whether subpopulations of monocytes exist with a single receptor specificity, nonoverlapping fluorescent probes for two chemotactic ligands, N-formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP) and C5a, were developed to simultaneously evaluate the expression of receptors for these ligands on individual monocytes. The subsequent incubation with different fluorochrome labeled C5a and FMLP probes and monoclonal antibodies specific for antigenic determinants on distinct subsets of mononuclear cells followed by analysis with dual parameter flow microfluorometry indicated that cells that express C5a and FMLP receptors are the OKM1, Mac-1, and Fc gamma receptor positive population. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that approximately 90% of peripheral blood monocytes expressed FMLP receptors, and the majority of FMLP+ cells were also C5a receptor positive. In addition, a parallel spectrum of chemotactic ligand receptor density from low to high levels was demonstrated for both C5a and FMLP. Additional analysis revealed that the density of chemotactic ligand receptors on resting peripheral blood monocytes did not correlate with monocyte maturation levels measured by HLA-DR expression. Elucidation of the monocyte chemotactic receptor-ligand interactions that lead to migration and/or activation may provide insight into the regulation of monocyte function in inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "H-2 heterozygous marrow stem cells, lymphoid progenitor cells, and leukemia/lymphoma cells do not express hemopoietic or hybrid histocompatibility (Hh) antigens, which are important transplantation antigens recognized during the rejection of normal or neoplastic hemopoietic cells. The Hh-1b determinant of the H-2b haplotype maps to the D region of H-2. We have tested the hypothesis that gene(s) at or near H-2D of the H-2d haplotype down-regulate the expression of Hh-1b in the trans configuration. We used Abelson leukemia virus-transformed pre-B lymphoma cells (ACCb) of BALB/c X BALB.B (H-2d X H-2b) origin, as well as variant lines of ACCb, which were selected for resistance to monoclonal anti-H-2 antibodies plus complement. B6D2F1 (H-2b X H-2d), C3B6F1 (H-2k X H-2b), or B6 (H-2b) mice were infused with inocula of 5 X 10(6) B6 bone marrow cells (BMC). Proliferation of donor-derived marrow cells was judged in terms of DNA synthesis by measuring the splenic incorporation of 5-iodo(125I)-2'-deoxyuridine (IUdR) 5 days after cell transfer. B6 BMC grew much better in B6 than in F1 hybrid host mice, an expression of \"hybrid resistance\". As observed previously, the injection of EL-4 (H-2b, Hh-1b) tumor cells prior to infusion of B6 (H-2b, Hh-1b) BMC enhanced the growth of B6 BMC in F1 hybrid mice. Therefore, this in vivo \"cold target cell competition\" type of assay can be used to detect the expression of Hh-1b antigens. Unlike EL-4 (H-2b) cells, hybrid resistance was not affected by prior infusion of (H-2b X H-2d) heterozygous ACCb cells. In contrast, three ACCb variant cell lines, H-2d-, Ld-Dd-, and Dd-, enhanced the growth of B6 BMC in F1 hosts. The ACCb H-2b- cell line did not affect hybrid resistance to B6 BMC. The loss of gene expression on the H-2d chromosome at or very near the H-2Dd locus is correlated with the appearance Hh-1b, as determined by the in vivo cold target competition assay. These results support the hypothesis that heterozygous cells possess trans-acting, dominant, down-regulatory genes mapping near H-2D that control the Hh-1 phenotype of lymphoid tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "A comparison was made between the diagnostic value of assaying nickel-induced lymphocyte proliferation (lymphocyte transformation test, LTT) and migration inhibition factor (MIF) production in nickel contact sensitivity. Although lymphocyte proliferation was significantly increased in the group of patients with skin test reactivity to nickel, positive LTT were also frequently found in skin test-negative subjects: in 63% of subjects with and in 30% of subjects without a history of metal allergy. This would limit the value of the LTT as an in vitro correlate of skin test reactivity. However, in certain patients positive lymphocyte transformation may reveal nickel sensitization at a time of undetectable skin reactivity. Data obtained with the macrophage migration inhibition test (MMIT) showed a good correlation with nickel patch test reactions. Accurate determination of MIF became feasible by using cells from the human monocytoid cell line U937 as target cells in a microdroplet agarose assay. Using this MMIT, positive reactions occurred in 13% of the healthy controls and false-negative reactions were found in 26% of patients with positive skin test reactivity to nickel. As LTT and MMIT data appeared to be only weakly correlated in the individuals tested, a dual parameter analysis was performed. An excellent correlation [p = 1.8 (10(-8]] was found between skin test and in vitro reactivity for individuals with matching in vitro results (60% of all individuals tested). In those individuals with discordant in vitro data, skin testing will remain indispensable for diagnosing nickel allergy.\r"

Given their similar physical and biologic properties, it was presumed that ETAF would share homology to known IL-1 sequences. A murine IL-1 alpha complimentary DNA (cDNA) probe hybridized with a 2.1 kb RNA from the murine keratinocyte cell line PAMM 212. Further, a 24-base synthetic IL-1 beta probe complementary to a region 700 bases from the putative 5'-end of human IL-1 beta hybridized with 2.7- and 1.6-kb RNAs in human keratinocytes, monocytes, and promyelocytic leukemia cells. Reverse transcripts primed with the IL-1 beta oligonucleotide revealed major first-strand cDNAs from human keratinocyte COLO-16 cell mRNA and human monocyte mRNA of about 700 bases, consistent with the expected cDNA from IL-1 beta. A partial library constructed from this cDNA contained clones that hybridized with the IL-1 beta oligonucleotide. The 750 bp-IL-1 beta-like cDNA clones were not identical to IL-1 beta as judged by restriction mapping and Northern analysis. These cDNA clones hybridized with the 1.6-kb keratinocyte mRNA but not to the 1.6-kb monocyte nor to the 2.7-kb mRNA. The 1.6-kb keratinocyte mRNA may encode a new IL-1-like species.\r"

This effect was seen both in donor-recipient combinations that differ at the major histocompatibility complex and in those differing only at minor histocompatibility loci. Treatment with 8-methoxypsoralen or long-wave UV radiation alone was ineffective in prolonging allograft survival, as were doses of mid-wave UV radiation (UVB, 280-320 nm) that produced greater inflammation than the PUVA protocol. Allografted, PUVA-treated animals also demonstrated decreased alloantigen reactivity against donor-strain spleen cells during the period of treatment by cytotoxicity assays. Allografts of skin in the murine system are highly immunogenic and are generally rejected faster than organ allografts; thus PUVA treatment appears to exert a potent effect on prolonging allograft survival. The systemic nature of the effect and the fact that adverse side effects from PUVA are largely limited to the skin suggest that PUVA might have a role in clinical organ transplantation management.\r"

Excretion of galactomannan into the urine, measured in rabbits, was another major catabolic route and accounted for 35% of the dose by 24 hr. Immunization of rabbits increased hepatic uptake and decreased urinary excretion. Hepatic uptake in unimmunized rats could be decreased by Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan, alpha-methyl mannoside, and N-acetylglucosamine, known inhibitors of the macrophage mannose receptor. Autoradiography showed hepatic radiolabeled galactomannan to be concentrated in Kupffer cells, which express the mannosyl receptor for glycoproteins. Macrophage mannosyl receptors may constitute a general mechanism for clearing fungal mannans from the bloodstream.\r"

Both germinated and ungerminated Candida adhered poorly to bladder mucosa. Unlike prior urinary tract infection due to an enterococcus that failed to agglutinate Candida in vitro, prior urinary tract infection with a mannose-binding strain of Escherichia coli that agglutinated C. albicans in vitro enhanced adherence of C. albicans to bladder mucosa and increased susceptibility to ascending C. albicans urinary tract infection. Thus, resistance to Candida ascending urinary tract infection is likely to be due to poor adherence of C. albicans to normal bladder mucosa.\r"

Biotyping confirmed strain identity in both cases, and no new plasmids were detected in the resistant isolates. Both resistant isolates produced beta-lactamase constitutively. Slow but definite hydrolysis of ceftazidime was demonstrated by using purified beta-lactamase in a spectrophotometric assay. Further evidence that beta-lactamase is responsible for resistance in these organisms was provided by the demonstration that cefoxitin, a potent inducer of beta-lactamase, antagonized the activity of ceftazidime against these isolates. This antagonism could be prevented by inhibition of derepression of beta-lactamase with clindamycin. Clindamycin also prevented regrowth of ceftazidime-treated cells in time-kill studies and markedly reduced production of beta-lactamase in induced cultures at concentrations as low as 2 micrograms/ml.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the antisecretory activity of berberine sulfate (BS), we studied 165 adult patients with acute diarrhea due to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Vibrio cholerae in randomized controlled trials. In patients with ETEC diarrhea who received 400 mg of BS in a single oral dose, the mean stool volumes were significantly less than those of the controls during three consecutive 8-hr periods after treatment (P less than .05). At 24 hr after treatment, significantly more patients who were treated with BS and had ETEC diarrhea stopped having diarrhea as compared with the controls (42% vs 20%, P less than .05). In patients with cholera who received 400 mg of BS, the mean 8-hr stool volume during the second 8-hr period after treatment declined to 2.22 liters, which was significantly less than the 2.79 liters found in the controls (P less than .05). However, patients with cholera who received 1200 mg of BS plus tetracycline did not have significant reduction in stool output compared with patients who received tetracycline alone. No side effects of BS were noted. These results indicated that BS is an effective and safe antisecretory drug for ETEC diarrhea, whereas the activity against cholera is slight and not additive with tetracycline.\r"

One hundred seventy users of three family practices were randomly assigned to receive a six-month educational program provided by a nurse practitioner or to a control group. Outcome variables were assessed over a 12-month follow-up period by mailed questionnaires and validated when possible by review of medical records. During the six months immediately following the intervention, recipients had a lower rate of restricted-activity days than controls. During the follow-up period, symptom experience, physical function, social function, and emotional function were similar in the two groups. While the overall improvement in social supports was not significantly better at the completion of the intervention for recipients than for controls, those recipients who developed strong supports had fewer restricted-activity days than those who continued to have weak supports. This educational program may provide temporary benefit to adults with high psychosocial risk for health impairment.\r"

Rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep may reflect relatively greater activation or efficiency of the right and left hemispheres, respectively. Much of the mentation in wakefulness is dominated by the left hemisphere and its heavy language orientation. Modern theories of dreaming suggest that new solutions or adaptations to existing problems (i.e., new attitudes) may be enhanced by REM sleep and reflected in dreams. This report reviews experimental and clinical evidence to find neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and clinical support for the view that information is processed during REM sleep through increased activation, efficiency, and/or relative functional isolation of the right hemisphere.\r"

To determine the ultrastructural cellular distribution of Ia molecules in the autoimmune disease model acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) we studied central nervous system (CNS) tissues from adult Strain 13 guinea pigs (GP). Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis was induced by sensitization with GP spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Nine of 11 sensitized GP had clinical and histologic EAE whereas unsensitized and CFA-sensitized controls were normal. Central nervous system tissues were reacted with monoclonal antibodies to either GP Ia or T cell surface antigen using an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique and studied by electron microscopy; Ia was found on luminal but not abluminal surfaces of many meningeal and parenchymal vascular endothelial cells in GP with EAE. In EAE perivascular lymphocytes and macrophages and processes of unidentified cells in the parenchyma expressed surface Ia and Ia+ macrophages encircled and phagocytosed myelin. T cells were found predominantly in perivascular inflammatory cuffs. These observations indicate that following immunologic challenge Ia is expressed on luminal surfaces of vascular endothelium and on resident CNS cells, suggesting the possibility that these cells may have active antigen-presenting functions in CNS inflammatory reactions.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated epitopes of neurofilament (NF) proteins are distributed in different regions of individual neurons. Immunocytochemical methods, with monoclonal antibodies directed against phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated NF, demonstrated nonphosphorylated NF in perikarya and proximal axonal segments of neurons in dorsal root ganglia, while phosphorylated NF proteins were present in axons of these cells. The distribution of these epitopes of NF were examined at various times following injury of axons in the rat sciatic nerve. Between one and 21 days after crush of the proximal nerve, phosphorylated NF were present in neuronal perikarya. We have compared patterns of perikaryal immunoreactivity at one time point (three weeks) following a more distal crush or complete transection of the sciatic nerve. At this time period, following transection/ligation, phosphorylated NF immunoreactivity was not present in perikarya, but abnormal staining was observed after nerve crush. These altered distributions of phosphorylated epitopes of NF are of interest because several recent reports have indicated that similar, but not identical, abnormal staining patterns occur in human neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In accord with previous studies, this investigation indicates that one response of neurons to injury, or to disease, is an abnormal distribution of phosphorylated epitopes of NF proteins.\r"

Rationale for the trial was provided by the observed decrease in leukemic blast cell self-renewal in culture following exposure to Ara-C. Compared with a previous trial of 57 patients treated with multidrug therapy, single-drug Ara-C was associated with a significantly improved complete remission rate (P = .010), although the survival time was not increased. All patients with low self-renewal responded to HDAra-C in contrast to the previous trial where some patients with this phenotype failed remission induction. The clinical observations are consistent with the view that the antileukemic effect of Ara-C has some specificity for cellular events required for self-renewal of blast cells. Exposure in vivo to Ara-C was associated with an increase in blast stem cell renewal at relapse, indicating that maintenance with other drugs should be tested. The study demonstrates the importance of biological attributes in design and analysis of clinical trials.\r"

Radioimmunodetection was performed with a 5.6 to 13.1 mCi 131I-T101 preparation (9.6 to 10.5 mg). A therapeutic dose of 100.5 to 150.1 mCi 131I on 9.9 to 16.9 mg of antibody was administered to five patients, with subsequent retreatment following plasmapheresis in three patients at the time of disease progression. All patients responded to their initial therapy and two patients responded to retreatment. Regression of skin lesions and peripheral adenopathy was witnessed. All patients reported resolution of their chronic pruritus. The duration of response ranged from 3 weeks to 3 months. Acute toxicity included fevers, pruritus, and mild dyspnea in two instances. Myelosuppression was seen in patients receiving the 144.7 mCi, 145.0 mCi, and 150.1 mCi 131I-T101 doses. Radioimmunodiagnostic and therapy studies included gamma scintigraphy, plasma, urinary, and wholebody antibody clearances, and biodistribution determined from skin, bone marrow, and liver biopsies. Immunologic studies included immunoperoxidase staining of target tissues, immunofluorescent flow cytometric analysis on peripheral blood and bone marrow, assays for serum blocking factors, determination of a human antimouse antibody (HAMA) response, and quantitation of circulating T101 levels. These preliminary data suggest that 131I-T101 has therapeutic potential in CTCL and that myelosuppression will be the limiting toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred and eighty-eight patients with extensive small-cell carcinoma of the lung (SCCL) were entered into a three-arm prospective randomized trial. The purpose was both to compare etoposide with methotrexate (MTX) in a combination chemotherapy regimen otherwise consisting of vincristine (VCR), lomustine (CCNU), and cyclophosphamide (CTX) and to evaluate a treatment design based on cell kinetic observations suggesting enhanced sensitivity to etoposide three to six days after administration of VCR, CCNU, and CTX. In all three treatment arms, VCR, CCNU, and CTX were administered on day 1 of a 28-day cycle. In arm A, MTX was administered on days 14 and 17, while in arm B, MTX was replaced by etoposide administered on days 14 through 17. In arm C, MTX was also replaced by etoposide, but administered on days 3 through 6. Overall survival was significantly longer for patients treated with \"early\" etoposide (arm C; median, 33 weeks) as compared with arm A (MTX; median, 23 weeks) (P less than .05), but not statistically different from \"late\" etoposide administration (arm B; median, 27 weeks). However, for patients with initial favorable performance status (0 + 1), a significantly longer survival was obtained for those treated with early etoposide (arm C. median, 51 weeks) as compared with patients in arm A (median, 32 weeks) and arm B (median, 36 weeks) (P less than .05). Two-year survival was obtained in six patients (7%) in arm C compared with three patients (3%) in arm B and none in arm A. The study confirmed that etoposide is an active drug in the treatment of SCCL and when combined with CTX, CCNU, and VCR, the cell kinetic approach of an early administration yields the best results.\r"

  ".W": "In 1979 we initiated a phase III study in the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) which was designed to determine the value of chest radiation in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer patients achieving complete response after induction chemotherapy, and to test the use of wide-field v more limited-volume radiation in patients with partial responses (PRs) and patients with stable disease (SD). The induction chemotherapy (VMV-VAC) consisted of vincristine, 2 mg intravenously (IV) every week for six doses; methotrexate, 60 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 43; VP-16, 50 mg/m2/d IV days 1 to 5 and 43 to 47; doxorubicin, 60 mg/m2 IV days 22 and 64; and cyclophosphamide, 1,000 mg/m2 IV days 22 and 64. Four hundred ninety-four patients were registered, of whom 473 were eligible. Of 466 response-evaluable patients, 153 (33%) achieved complete disease remission (CR) with chemotherapy. A total of 387 patients entered the consolidation phase of treatment after chemotherapy and response determination. CR patients were prospectively randomized to receive chest radiation, consisting of 4,800 rad administered in a split-course scheme, or to continue chemotherapy without interruption. The treatment volume was based on tumor extent before the induction chemotherapy. Maintenance chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide and VP-16 administered for four cycles before a period of reinduction chemotherapy consisting of VMV-VAC as described above. Patients receiving chest radiation therapy were given the same maintenance and reinduction chemotherapy programs following completion of the chest radiation. One hundred ninety-one eligible patients achieving PR or SD status after induction chemotherapy were randomized to a preinduction treatment volume or to a postinduction reduced tumor volume, with treatment portals designed according to tumor extent before or after induction chemotherapy, respectively. After completion of the entire treatment plan, there were 218 (47%) CRs and 121 (26%) PRs. These figures represent the greatest response achieved at any point in the treatment program. The median survival for all eligible patients was 57 weeks (74 weeks for CRs). Overall survival for CR patients was not different for patients who did or did not receive chest radiation. However, patterns of tumor relapse were affected by the chest radiation, as 38 of 42 relapsing patients who did not receive radiation had intrathoracic recurrences in comparison to only 20 of 36 radiated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Eligibility included conservative or radical primary treatment for local cure. Patients were then randomized to control or Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH). Adriamycin was administered at 70 mg/m2 (slow push, every 3 weeks for seven courses for a maximum of 550 mg/m2). To date, 32 patients, 17 males and 15 females, with an age range of 17 to 75 years (median, 44 years) have been followed sufficiently long to be included in this analysis. Nine patients have died. The median follow-up of the remaining 23 patients is 30 months (range, 2 to 50 months). Survival was not significantly different between Adriamycin or control. However, the disease-free interval was slightly different in favor of observation. This preliminary report does not support the hypothesis that Adriamycin is an effective adjuvant therapy for soft tissue sarcoma. Due to the small numbers, these results must be interpreted in relation to our ability to detect a difference, if in fact one existed. These preliminary data suggest that adjuvant Adriamycin not be used outside the confines of a clinical trial such as the current intergroup adjuvant sarcoma study.\r"

Forty-nine of 51 consecutive patients were treated; only one patient progressed on chemotherapy, and of 36 patients with measurable neck nodes, eight had complete and 19 had partial clearance (greater than 50% decrease in cross-sectional area) of these nodes when assessed before initiation of radiotherapy. Despite the high rate of tumor response (75%; 95% confidence limits, 59% to 91%), the actuarial survival and disease-free survival curves were almost identical to those recorded for a consecutive group of 140 historical controls of similar stage distribution treated with radiation alone. This chemotherapy provided a high rate of tumor remission, but did not appear to convey long-term benefit to patients when used before radiation therapy.\r"

  ".W": "There has been a recent renewal of interest in surgical therapy for medically intractable epilepsies. Cortical resection and callosotomy are the most widely accepted modes of surgical management. The indications for each of these approaches are reviewed. Although there has been much interest in imaging techniques, including positron emission tomography, to identify epileptogenic zones, identification still depends primarily on the electroencephalogram (EEG). There are several approaches to the evaluation and intraoperative management of patients undergoing cortical resection for temporal lobe epileptogenic zones. These range from selection based on scalp interictal EEG criteria, with resections guided by electrocorticography and functional mapping, to selection based on the location of ictal onset as recorded by chronically implanted depth electrodes, with an anatomically standard resection of the temporal lobe or resection limited to amygdalohippocampectomy. No one approach provides the optimum balance of benefits to risks and costs for all patients. The relative value of the different approaches for various populations of patients with medically intractable partial complex seizures is reviewed. Techniques for minimizing the morbidity of these operations, especially in regard to language and memory, are also discussed, as are the contributions to an understanding of the neurobiology of human epilepsy and human higher functions derived from the surgical therapy of epilepsy.\r"

Specific uses for this device include stereotaxic radiosurgery and stereotaxic guidance during microsurgery. Other attractive features of this device are its capability of being precisely reapplied, its compatibility with both computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and the availability of an accessory device to adapt it for animal stereotaxis.\r"

  ".U": "87168748\r", 
  ".W": "Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) is defined as a regulatory, facultative component of energy expenditure, stimulated by overeating, which helps maintain energy balance. DIT may play a central role in the regulation of energy expenditure and in the etiology of certain types of obesity. Most experiments testing the existence or the mechanisms of DIT have used the cafeteria diet for the purposes of stimulating hyperphagia, a requisite for studies of DIT. Yet such a diet is inappropriate for studies of thermogenesis because its use prevents researchers from obtaining an experimental outcome that can be clearly interpreted. The primary limitation of the cafeteria diet is that its nutritional composition is uncontrolled. The diet is self-selected from a variety of supermarket foods that tend to be high in fat and/or carbohydrate and low in protein, vitamins and minerals. Hence, the diets consumed by the animals are likely to be deficient in protein, vitamins or minerals. There is evidence that dietary deficiency of protein, vitamins and minerals can increase thermogenesis and in protein-adequate diets, the balance of fat and carbohydrate in the diet can also influence thermogenesis with high carbohydrate diets increasing thermogenesis more than isoenergetic high fat diets. Hence, an observed increase in thermogenesis in cafeteria fed animals might be interpreted incorrectly to be the result of increased energy consumption when it is attributable to dietary imbalance or deficiency. Because the diet is self-selected, it is possible for each animal to choose a diet that varies in nutritional composition from that selected by every other animal, so control of dietary intake is compromised.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A 30% reduction in food intake from 5 to 68 wk of age resulted in parallel lowering of body weight in both lean and obese rats compared to their respective ad libitum-fed control groups. In lean rats, epididymal and retroperitoneal fat pad weights and cell size were lowered by food restriction. In obese rats there was an effect of food restriction on growth of the epididymal pad but not the retroperitoneal pad. Hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia and elevated serum albumin levels, as well as higher activity of lipogenic enzymes, were also not affected by food restriction in the obese rat. In a second experiment, long-term food restriction resulted in greater glucose conversion to CO2 in response to insulin in adipocytes from lean rats but not obese rats compared to their respective control groups. These results indicate that food restriction throughout the first year of life in the obese Zucker rat does not alter the development of hyperplastic obesity and insulin resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Exacerbation of hypertension by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in hypertensive patients remains controversial among physicians and investigators. Because of the many differences among studies of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and blood pressure control in patients with hypertension, the authors critically evaluated the published clinical evidence on this subject using standardized methodologic criteria. A search of the literature from 1965 to 1986 identified 31 relevant studies, of which only eight were double-blind randomized controlled trials that provided the most clinically useful information. Of these eight best-designed studies, five of the six that studied indomethacin concluded that it may interfere with antihypertensive effectiveness in selected patients with treated, stable hypertension. The remaining double-blind randomized studies included comparisons of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Their limited results suggest that sulindac is less likely than piroxicam, naproxen or indomethacin to cause an attenuation of antihypertensive therapy. More research on this subject is needed, with greater attention to methodologic details and identification of predisposing risk factors for impairment of blood pressure control by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\r"

The overall consultation rate was 11.9 per 100 patient visits, with 78% of the referrals to other physicians and 22% to non-physician specialists. Consultation rates and patterns of referral varied little between physicians with different levels of experience. Eighteen per cent of the consultations resulted in a no-show by the patient to the consultant. Referring physicians received communications from the consultants 80.5% of the time when appointments were kept. By multivariate regression two variables were shown to be most important in determining the internist's overall satisfaction: 1) how well the consultant aided the internist in his ongoing management of the patient's problem, and 2) how well specific questions were addressed by the specialist. Other statistically significant variables were the clarity and promptness of the consultant's reply, the educational value of the consultation, and specific management recommendations made by the consultant. To improve the consultation process no-shows must be minimized, communication from the consultant maximized, and the interaction between the internist and the consultant bolstered.\r"

Subjects were 585 infants 15 to 24 months of age. They were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of PRP or PRP-D vaccine. There were no significant differences in the rate of adverse reactions between the two vaccine groups. Minor local reactions occurred in 10.3% of PRP and 12.5% of PRP-D recipients, and fever in 27.4% of PRP and 23.8% of PRP-D recipients. All reactions resolved within 48 hours. Serum samples were obtained just before vaccination and after 1 month. Prevaccination antibody levels were similar for the PRP (0.035 micrograms/mL) and PRP-D (0.027 micrograms/mL) groups, with no differences in levels by age, sex, race, vaccine lot, or study site. Both groups had significant rises in geometric mean levels, but this difference was significantly greater for PRP-D (2.166 micrograms/mL) than for PRP (0.154 micrograms/mL). In addition, the percentage of responders as determined by three definitions (twofold titer rise, greater than 0.15 micrograms/mL, and greater than 1.0 micrograms/mL) was also significantly greater for PRP-D than PRP. In contrast to a marked age-related immunogenicity to PRP (P less than 0.001), there was no significant variation in immune response to PRP-D by age. PRP-D conjugate vaccine appears to be as safe and significantly more immunogenic than PRP vaccine for children vaccinated at 15 to 24 months of age.\r"

The predominant causes of mortality were primary nonfunction of the allograft (three patients) and sepsis (three). Major morbidity was caused by hepatic artery thrombosis (five patients), gastrointestinal complications (six), biliary tract complications (five), and bacterial and viral infections (13). Six patients underwent retransplantation; three of these six survived. Results could be improved by prevention of hepatic artery thrombosis, by decreasing the incidence of sepsis, and by procurement of more and better suited pediatric donors.\r"

All children completed the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale (P-H), the State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAIC), and the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control test (NSLC) at entry and after treatment or delay. Parents completed the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). There were no significant group differences in background demographic variables. Significant improvements in the P-H Scale (P = 0.04) and three of its subscales occurred in children in the treatment group compared with those in whom treatment was delayed. The changes were greatest for those who had the largest decreases in wetting frequency. Changes in CBCL, STAIC, and NSLC scores were not statistically significant.

  ".W": "3-(2-Carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) was synthesized as a rigid analog of 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate, a previously known antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) preferring, or NMDA-type, of excitatory amino acid receptor. CPP was found to be a potent, selective and competitive antagonist of NMDA-type receptors. CPP antagonized with an IC50 of 8 muM [3H]ACh release which was evoked from rat striatal brain slices by NMDA (50 muM). In contrast, the release of [3H]ACh evoked by elevated KCI was not inhibited by CPP even at a concentration of 100 muM. The antagonism by CPP of NMDA-evoked [3H]ACh release was competitive, with a pA2 of 5.66 for CPP, compared with a pA2 value of 5.22 for 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate. CPP affected neither the uptake of L-[3H]glutamate nor the inhibition by aconitine of L-[3H]glutamate uptake, suggesting a lack of membrane-stabilizing or local anesthetic effects, and also suggesting that CPP itself may not be taken up through the L-glutamate membrane transporter. Moreover, [3H] CPP was not accumulated by synaptosomes (P2 fraction) which avidly accumulate L-[3H]glutamate, supporting the concept that this NMDA-type receptor antagonist acts at an NMDA-type receptor on the external surface of the plasma membrane. CPP (10 muM) failed to interact with any of 21 other putative neurotransmitter receptors including alpha-[3H]amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid binding (quisqualate-type receptor) and [3H]kainate binding (kainate-type receptor). Audiogenic convulsions in DBA/2 mice were blocked by CPP (ED50 = 1.5 mg/kg i.p.) as were NMDA-induced seizures in CF-1 mice (ED50 = 1.9 mg/kg i.p.). In both strains, CPP impaired the traction reflex at higher doses (ED50 = 6.8 mg/kg and 6.1 mg/kg and 6.1 mg/kg i.p. for DBA/2 and CF-1, respectively). The traction reflex impairment by CPP may be due to muscle relaxant effects of the compound, an explanation supported by the finding that CPP reduced muscle tone as assessed by electromyogram measurement in animals whose muscle tone had been increased by opiate administration. Finally, cerebellar cyclic GMP levels, known to be sensitive to neurotransmission via NMDA-type receptors, were decreased by CPP (ED50 = 4.7 mg/kg i.p.) in mice. In conclusion, based upon the competitive antagonism by CPP of NMDA-evoked [3H] ACh release in vitro and the antagonism of NMDA-induced convulsions in vivo, the data presented are consistent with competitive antagonism of NMDA-type receptors.\r"

[3H]CPP bound with relatively high affinity (Kd = 201 nM) to Triton-treated rat brain crude synaptic membranes using a centrifugation assay. Binding was saturable, reversible, heat sensitive and dependent on protein concentration. Specific binding, which represented 75 to 85% of the total counts bound, was enriched in synaptosomal and microsomal fractions of rat brain, suggesting an involvement in events related to synaptic transmission. On a regional basis, binding was highest in hippocampus, followed by cortex greater than striatum greater than cerebellum = thalamus. No specific binding could be detected in pons medulla or in liver, kidney, heart, lung and adrenal tissue. [3H]CPP binding was stereoselective for the isomers of glutamate, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, homocysteic acid, alpha-aminoadipic acid and N-methyl-aspartate. The most potent compounds tested were L-glutamate and CPP, which were equiactive in displacing [3H]CPP. The order of activity of other excitatory amino acid receptor ligands was D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid greater than L-homocysteic acid greater than or equal to DL-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid = D-aspartate = L-aspartate greater than L-serine-O-sulfate = D-alpha-aminoadipic acid = ibotenate greater than NMDA greater than DL-2-amino-6-phosphonohexanoic acid greater than quisqualate greater than N-methyl-L-aspartate. The quisqualate- and kainate-type receptor agonists DL-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate and kainic acid, respectively, had negligible activity at 100 microM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

By varying the dose of progestin during the cycle, the total steroid dose per month has been reduced as compared to most fixed-dose preparations. Lowering the progestin dose appears to reduce the incidence of certain cardiovascular complications. Different oral contraceptive formulations may selectively alter lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Norethindrone-containing multiphasics appear to have the greatest efficacy and the smallest metabolic impact.\r"

In a double-blind study of 21 patients with primary dysmenorrhea, 81% (9 of 11) reported significant relief from menstrual pain after the surgery. Performed as an outpatient procedure, laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation may alleviate dysmenorrheic complaints when other modalities have failed. Half the treated women reported continued relief of menstrual pain at 12 months. These results suggest that uterosacral nerve interruption may prove an effective alternative treatment for this menstrual disorder.\r"

In an attempt to further define the inhibitory effect of excessive PRL release on luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretory patterns in human plasma, four amenorrheic women with known hyperprolactinemia were studied before and during bromocriptine (BRCR) therapy. Ten-minute blood samples collected with a continuous withdrawal pump for two hours were analyzed for immunoreactive LHRH (IR-LHRH), LH and PRL using previously established radioimmunoassay procedures. Three patients showed a significant rise in mean IR-LHRH plasma levels coincident with a significant decrease in mean PRL concentrations five days to two weeks following BRCR therapy, whereas mean LH titers increased significantly in only one patient. One patient showed no increase in IR-LHRH or LH with BRCR therapy and failed to show a decrease in serum PRL to normal levels after five days of this treatment. A defect in the control of PRL release in these patients seemed to result from the inability of dopaminergic inhibition to be mediated effectively and seemed to be associated with altered secretion of LHRH.\r"

A granular or homogeneous deposition of IgG was seen at the DEJ in 52.8% (19/36) of patients with PFS and in 16.7% (2/12) of controls. The difference in IgG deposition between patients with PFS and controls was statistically significant (p = 0.030). Patients with PFS and controls did not demonstrate significant IF staining for IgA, IgM, or C3. Albumin deposition at the DEJ appeared to parallel IgG deposition in patients with PFS and control subjects who were positive for this immunoglobulin. No relationship was noted between IgG deposition and demographic or clinical characteristics of these patients' disease. These data suggest that IgG and albumin deposition at the DEJ is frequent in PFS and that further study of this skin phenomenon is warranted.\r"

Of those 41 patients 2 suffered postoperative wound infections. Of 72 patients (64 per cent) with less than 5 white blood cells or no bacteria on a preoperative specimen 1 suffered a wound infection (p not significant by Fisher's exact test). Preoperative urine cultures and operative bladder cultures of all 3 patients failed to yield the organisms found later in the wound infections. The factors of sex, insulin-dependent diabetes, delayed graft function, living related versus cadaver donor and pre-transplant splenectomy had no significant relationship to wound infection rates. Renal transplantation can be performed safely in patients who have pyuria and bacteriuria but no signs or symptoms of infection.\r"

This disorder has been characterized by hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, hypertension, hypokalemia and enhanced erythrocyte sodium influx. Administration of spironolactone failed to correct the hypertension and electrolyte abnormality, which subsequently improved with triamterene therapy and a low salt diet. However, suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system remained unchanged after this treatment. In addition, an atrophic juxtaglomerular apparatus and hypertensive lesions in the arterioles were confirmed by kidney biopsy after triamterene therapy. Therefore, a process of intrinsic hyperactive distal sodium reabsorption, probably affected by aldosterone-independent sodium transport into erythrocytes, appears to be important in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. Triamterene therapy, which usually is performed in patients with this disease, might not be the ultimate therapy in the future even if electrolyte abnormalities were to be improved temporarily.\r"

Objective responses were noted in 7 of 45 patients (16 per cent) given cisplatin alone and in 9 of 42 (21 per cent) treated with the combination. There was no significant difference in response rate, response duration or survival but the combination was more toxic. Other combination regimens should be evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intracavernous self-injection of phentolamine and papaverine for the treatment of impotence, 30 patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of papaverine and phentolamine versus normal saline. A total of 29 patients completed the study. The phentolamine plus papaverine combination resulted in erection in 24 patients (82.8 per cent) and no erection occurred after injection of saline. Of the patients 12 (41.4 per cent) experienced technical difficulties with the injection. Ecchymosis of the penis at the site of injection was common and 1 patient experienced priapism that resolved spontaneously. No other side effects occurred. Intracavernous self-injection with phentolamine and papaverine appears to be a safe and effective treatment of impotence but long-term effects must be determined.\r"

  ".U": "87169957\r", 
  ".W": "We evaluated prospectively 49 women with renal scarring and a history of febrile urinary tract infections in regard to the incidence of recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infection and fecal colonization with P-fimbriated Escherichia coli. During a 3-year followup 26 patients (53 per cent) had symptomatic urinary tract infection (0.036 infections per patient-month), including 8 (16 per cent) who had 9 new episodes of febrile urinary tract infection, while 33 (67 per cent) had Escherichia coli bacteriuria (10(5) bacteria per ml. urine in pure culture). Thus, patients with previous febrile urinary tract infections and renal scarring have a high risk for recurrent infections. For comparison, the incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infection also was determined in 35 women with a recent episode of acute nonobstructive pyelonephritis and with normal kidneys on excretory urography. These patients had 0.031 symptomatic infections per patient-month. The fecal flora were examined twice a year for P-fimbriated Escherichia coli in 48 patients with renal scarring. Of these patients 21 (44 per cent) had at least 1 fecal colonization with a P-fimbriated Escherichia coli strain. However, in only 1 instance was a relationship detected between the presence of P-fimbriated Escherichia coli in the fecal flora and the development of subsequent febrile urinary tract infection. The findings indicate that fecal sampling twice a year is not of value to predict future urinary tract infections in adults with renal scarring.\r"

The only false passage not detected was at the bladder neck. Nevertheless the data show that transrectal sonography is an excellent tool to demonstrate false passages arising from the prostatic urethra. All 10 false passages were unroofed successfully with excellent results.\r"

This case demonstrates the need to evaluate and to manage newborns with scrotal cellulitis differently than older children and adults. A different group of organisms and a greater likelihood for systemic involvement are to be anticipated in newborns.\r"
