  ".W": "The effects of the volume and length of deadspace on the clearance of carbon dioxide from a lung model have been investigated during high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) at 1, 3 and 5 Hz. At 1 Hz, increasing the volume of the deadspace without changing the length caused a reduction in the clearance of carbon dioxide. At 5 Hz, an increase in the length of deadspace decreased carbon dioxide clearance, whilst an increase in volume had no effect. Since the delivered tidal volume was less than the volume of the morphological deadspace at this frequency, the elimination of carbon dioxide must have been accomplished by mechanisms which are not considered important at normal tidal volumes and frequencies. Furthermore, the clearance of carbon dioxide at 5 Hz was very inefficient compared with that at 1 Hz. It is concluded that, during HFJV, carbon dioxide is cleared most efficiently when the frequency is low enough for the delivered tidal volume to be greater than the volume of the morphological deadspace.\r"

Changes in arterial pressure were induced with infusions of sodium nitroprusside, noradrenaline and angiotensin II, after which ventilation was adjusted to return the PaCO2 near to control values. The PaO2 was maintained above chemoreceptor threshold throughout. When a steady state was achieved quantitative measurements of phrenic nerve activity were made. In six dogs an increase in mean arterial pressure from 114 to 167 mm Hg caused a mean reduction of phrenic nerve activity of 28%. In six dogs a decrease in mean arterial pressure from 128 to 82 mm Hg caused an increase in phrenic nerve activity of 22%. This shows that the reduction in arterial pressure induced by vasodilator drugs causes a major sustained stimulus to respiration, while increase in arterial pressure causes marked respiratory depression.\r"

The sequence of the DNA insert includes the 3'-untranslated region, the entire amino acid coding region for the mature PF4 protein, and a 5' region containing coding information for an additional 18 amino acids. In addition, supplemental genomic DNA sequencing shows that the full-length leader sequence is 30 amino acids long plus an initial methionine and codes for a hydrophobic signal-like sequence which is probably involved in transmembrane transport. A single species mRNA of approximately 800 nucleotides was detected on blots of HEL cell poly(A) + RNA using a labeled PF4 cDNA probe. The human PF4 leader sequence shares some DNA, but no amino acid, homology with the 15 amino acids at the N-terminus of mature bovine PF4, suggesting rapid divergence in this region of PF4 between these two species. Sequence comparison of the coding regions of mature PF4 and gamma IP-10, a protein induced in a variety of cells following treatment with gamma-interferon, shows a corrected divergence of 76%. The divergence of a common ancestor protein into PF4 and gamma IP-10 may have accompanied the development of sophisticated immune and coagulation systems in vertebrates. The availability of cDNA and genomic DNA information for these genes in other species will be useful in studying the evolution of the coagulation and immune systems.\r"

Screening by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique showed that MM4 reacted with human MM cell lines (7 of 7 positive), as well as bone marrow aspirates from MM patients (4 of 4 cases positive). MM4 did not react with marrow aspirates from control patients (3 cases), or with peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells from normal subjects, lymphocytic (12 cases) and myelogenous (8 cases) leukemia patients. In addition, MM4 was negative with polymorphonuclear leukocytes and RBCs from normal donors. By means of the immunoperoxidase technique, the MM4-reactive antigen was detected in paraffin-embedded, Zenker formalin-fixed bone marrow biopsies of MM (12 of 12 cases positive), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (2 of 2 cases positive), asymptomatic plasma cell dyscrasia (4 of 4 cases positive), and certain lymphomas (2 of 5 cases positive). Marrow biopsies from lymphocytic (5 cases) and myelogenous (5 cases) leukemias were uniformly negative. The MM4-reactive antigen also was expressed on plasma cells generated from pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-stimulated normal PBM cultures. The pattern of reactivity of MM4 with lymphocytes of B origin was similar to that of the plasma cell MoAb PCA-1. Competitive binding studies showed, however, that these two MoAbs recognized distinct antigenic determinants. These observations suggest that MM4 may be useful for the study of human plasma cell dyscrasias.\r"

Individual NK clones suppressed granulocyte, monocyte, erythroid, or mixed colony formation in a heterogeneous but clonally stable manner. Inhibition of colony growth required a period of close cell contact between NK cell and progenitor cell with maximum inhibition occurring after 8 to 18 hours of preincubation time. The mechanism of killing was at least partially humoral, however, as cell-free supernatants generated by NK clones \"activated\" by contact with a target cell also inhibited progenitor cell growth. One of the possible humoral mediators was identified as gamma-interferon by studies with specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. These results show that clonal NK lines can be further activated by coming in contact with hematopoietic progenitor cells, resulting in substantial inhibition of colony formation in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Bilineage differentiation along both the T lymphoid and the myeloid lineage while in in vivo diffusion chamber (DC) and in vitro suspension culture was observed in a case of acute unclassified leukemia (null-AL) and t(4;17). Prior to culture, the blast cells were TdT and la positive but did not express any lineage-specific antigenic markers. Furthermore, the immunoglobulin heavy chain and T cell receptor beta-chain genes were in germline configuration. Cytogenetically, all metaphases had the unique translocation t(4;17) (q25;q23) prior to and after culture, supporting the leukemic origin of the cells. During both DC culture and suspension culture with and without tetradecanoyl-phorbol-acetate (TPA), a substantial increase in the absolute and relative number of cells expressing both myeloid and T lymphoid antigenic markers occurred. Double-fluorescence analysis demonstrated the expression of antigenic markers of both lineages on the same population of cells, and electron microscopy revealed the induction of myeloperoxidase after both DC and suspension culture. Immunoglobulin heavy chain and T cell receptor beta-chain genes remained in germline configuration after treatment with TPA, when analyzed with JH and CT beta probes, respectively. These findings indicate that this case represents a null-AL with dual-lineage capabilities, which has probably arisen from the malignant transformation of a bipotential stem cell of lymphoid and myeloid progeny.\r"

The lower limit of sensitivity of the assay applied to plasma is 2 ng/mL for one-chain t-PA but only 100 ng/mL for two-chain t-PA. Free t-PA in plasma taken at rest was found in 6 of 21 healthy subjects (4.5 +/- 0.8 ng/mL, mean +/- SD) and increased to 14 +/- 7.0 ng/mL after venous occlusion in 18 of these individuals. A linear correlation between total t-PA and free t-PA was observed with r = 0.92 (n = 18) and a slope of 1.08, indicating that t-PA released from the vessel wall circulates in the blood as the one-chain form. In 16 of 18 patients with deep vein thrombosis, the increase of total t-PA antigen after venous occlusion was comparable to that observed in controls, but the free t-PA was significantly lower or undetectable. The present assay for free t-PA may be useful for the investigation of the release and inhibition of t-PA under physiological, pharmacological, or pathological conditions in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Erythropoietic activity is known to be closely associated with marrow iron uptake. A modification of the standard measure of plasma iron turnover has been developed in which erythron transferrin uptake (ETU) rather than iron uptake has been calculated. The ETU has the advantage of providing a parameter of erythroid marrow activity independent of change produced by plasma iron and transferrin saturation. Measurements in 80 patients with anemia were compared to the normal value of 60 +/- 12 mumol/L whole blood/d. The mean ETU for ten patients with severe aplastic anemia and for six patients with pure red-cell aplasia were 12 +/- 8 and 12 +/- 11 mumol/L whole blood/d, respectively. In ten transfusion-dependent patients with renal failure under dialysis therapy, the mean value was 35 +/- 11, while ten other dialyzed patients who were transfusion independent had a mean ETU of 73 +/- 21 mumol/L whole blood/d. Sixteen patients with hemolytic anemia had an average ETU of 400 +/- 130, while 28 patients with ineffective erythropoiesis had a mean value of 474 +/- 147 mumol/L whole blood/d. While patients with hypoproliferative anemia showed no relation between the severity of anemia and ETU, those with hyperproliferative erythroid marrow showed increasing values as the anemia became more severe. Sequential measurements in patients with aplastic anemia under treatment and in thalassemic patients under transfusion therapy showed the value of this measurement in monitoring the effects of treatment on erythroid marrow activity. It is concluded that the measurement of ETU provides a more direct ferrokinetic evaluation of erythroid activity in anemic states.\r"

We also demonstrate that T101-IT in the presence of amantadine does not induce immunotoxin-mediated cytotoxicity in nontarget cells such as human marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells. These results provide further knowledge for the improvement of ex vivo purification of human bone marrow from normal or leukemic T cells prior to allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation, respectively.

Residual T-lineage blast colonies were observed after treatment with 1 micrograms/mL T101 (anti-CD5)-Ricin (R) + G3.7 (anti-CD7)-R in eight of 12 cases and after 100 micrograms/mL 4-HC in six of nine cases. By comparison, a combination of IT and 4-HC proved very effective against T-lineage leukemic progenitor cells, and no residual blast colonies were observed in any of the eight cases studied. We conclude that future trials should consider combined treatment protocols such as IT + 4-HC for more effective purging of autologous marrow grafts.\r"

In PRP, the patients' platelets showed defective aggregation in response to ADP, adrenaline, arachidonic acid (AA), and collagen, but normal agglutination occurred in response to ristocetin. In whole blood, however, platelet aggregation in response to the aggregating agents appeared to be either very similar to that which occurred in blood from normal subjects or only slightly reduced. There was a reduced response to all concentrations of ADP and to low concentrations of collagen but a normal response to all concentrations of adrenaline, AA, and higher concentrations of collagen. Conversely, there seemed to be an increased agglutination response to ristocetin. The abnormality in our two patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia probably lies in the inability of their platelets to form large, macroscopic aggregates rather than in platelet aggregation per se.\r"

The surface expression of this protein occurs through two distinct mechanisms. At low platelet concentrations (1 X 10(8)/mL), a divalent ion-dependent, low-capacity mechanism predominates. At higher cell concentrations, a divalent ion-dependent, higher capacity mechanism prevails that can account for greater than 90% of all the TSP surface expression measured. This mechanism requires the presence of both calcium and magnesium (Ca + Mg). The dependence of the divalent ion-dependent surface expression on platelet concentration suggests that release of the molecule from the cell followed by its binding to the cell surface mediates this component of the endogenous TSP-platelet interaction. These data are consistent with a two-receptor model for the platelet-surface expression of the endogenous TSP pool.\r"

  ".W": "Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a rare disease characterized by clonal expansion of LGL associated with chronic neutropenia, multiple auto-antibodies, and occasionally polyarthritis. We studied cell surface antigen expression and functional activity of leukemic LGL from ten such patients. Using two-color flow cytometric analysis, we found that leukemic LGL from all ten patients expressed the CD3 and HNK-1 markers, while cells from only four patients expressed IgG Fc receptors (FcR). The LGL leukemic cells had little or no NK activity (defined as MHC-nonrestricted cytotoxicity against K562 target cells); however, NK activity could be induced in leukemic LGL by in vitro treatment with as little as 0.05 microgram/mL of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. Cell sorting experiments demonstrated that NK activity was induced in CD3+ leukemic LGL (either CD3+, HNK-1+ or CD3+, FcR+) with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody but not in normal CD3+, FcR- T cells. Treatment with purified interleukin 2 (IL 2) also caused direct activation of some CD3+ leukemic LGL. Despite induction with anti-CD3 MAb or IL 2, activated leukemic LGL did not proliferate or express high density IL 2 receptors detectable by cell sorter analysis. Treatment with alpha interferon had minimal effect on NK activity of LGL leukemic cells. These results suggest that leukemic LGL may provide a useful model for examining the signals required for LGL maturation and activation.\r"

  ".W": "DNA samples from blood leukocytes or tumor biopsies of 45 patients with phenotypic B or T cell neoplasms were analyzed for rearrangements of the immunoglobulin (Ig) or T cell receptor (TCR) genes by Southern blot hybridization analysis. Rearrangements of the Ig heavy chain joining region genes (JH) were present in DNA from each of 28 B cell lymphomas and leukemias; 14 of 21 of these tumors also had rearrangements of the Ig kappa light chain joining (JK) or deleting element (KDel) genes. Conversely, 16 of 17 T cell lymphomas and leukemias had rearranged TCR beta chain genes. One B cell and one T cell tumor had rearrangements of both Ig and TCR genes. There was a strong correlation between the rearrangements of specific genes and the immunophenotype of the tumor: JH rearrangement without TCR beta chain rearrangement occurred only in B cell tumors; TCR beta chain rearrangement with or without JH rearrangement occurred only in T cell tumors, with one exception; and JK and KDel rearrangements were found only in B cell tumors. Thus, rearrangements of the Ig heavy and light chain genes and the TCR beta chain genes were found to be highly sensitive markers of monoclonal human lymphomas and lymphoid leukemias, with the type of gene rearrangements well correlated with the cell lineage of these neoplasms.\r"

  ".U": "87076990\r", 
  ".W": "The concept of lineage fidelity in acute leukemia has recently been challenged by the finding of rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes in a leukemic cell line and in a small number of sporadic cases of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia with a monocytic phenotype. We therefore screened leukemic blood or bone marrow samples of 33 adult patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia of FAB types M4 (23 patients) and M5 (10 patients); 28 were obtained at diagnosis and 5 at relapse. All cases were well characterized pathologically and histochemically. Cytogenetic analysis performed in each case demonstrated karyotypes that were representative of those generally seen in these types of leukemia, with a clonal abnormality present in all except 9 of 32 patients who were successfully studied. DNA prepared from each sample was digested with the restriction enzyme BamH1 and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization to probes for the JH region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. All 33 cases had DNA retained in the germline configuration with no evidence of rearrangement. This finding supports the concept of lineage fidelity, and suggests that true interlineage infidelity, myeloid to lymphoid, is a rare occurrence in adult acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.\r"

In all patients treatment with the analogue slightly increased postprandial glucose concentrations and suppressed insulin concentrations for two to two and a half hours after each injection; growth hormone concentrations decreased progressively with treatment. The patient with impaired glucose tolerance due to insulin deficiency developed diabetes mellitus after four months' treatment; concomitant treatment with glibenclamide resulted in a decreased glucose concentration and increased insulin concentration. This analogue of somatostatin had only minor side effects on glucose tolerance in patients with acromegaly and may be used in patients with impaired glucose tolerance provided that glucose concentrations are monitored closely.\r"

Its distribution in perivascular nerves suggests that one of its functions may be the regulation of peripheral vascular tone. Pregnancy is a physiological condition in which there are major haemodynamic changes. An increase in plasma volume of about 40% necessitates changes in peripheral vascular tone. In a cross sectional study plasma concentrations of immunoreactive calcitonin gene related peptide were measured throughout normal pregnancy and at five to seven days post partum. Calcitonin gene related peptide concentrations were significantly increased throughout pregnancy but fell after delivery. Calcitonin gene related peptide may participate in the physiological regulation of vasomotor tone in man.\r"

Slightly more of the patients who underwent a lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy had affective disorders, 38% having an anxiety state, depressive illness, or both. These findings question the view that mutilating treatment is predominantly responsible for the measurable psychiatric morbidity reported previously. Counselling services should be provided for all women treated for breast cancer, not just those who undergo mastectomy.\r"

There was a dose related reduction in symptoms, plasma follicle stimulating hormone concentration, and urinary calcium and hydroxyproline excretion. The relation of the response to plasma oestradiol values was similar for each variable with an initial large reduction and little change in response to increases in the plasma oestradiol concentration above 150 pmol/l (41 pg/ml). Hormone replacement therapy producing an effect equivalent to higher oestradiol concentrations is likely to increase the risk of side effects without conferring any additional benefit.\r"

A case-control study was carried out to determine the relative frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma and its relation to hepatitis B virus infection in urban born blacks. Three hundred and ninety two black patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and matched controls seen at two city hospitals were classified by questioning as urban born or rural born. The ratio of rural born to urban born blacks among the controls was 1.1:1.0 (207/185), whereas in the patients with cancer the ratio was 4.8:1.0 (324/68) (p less than 0.0001). Analysis of the prevalence of hepatitis B markers in 62 urban born and matched rural born blacks with hepatocellular carcinoma showed no differences in the frequency of current or past hepatitis B virus infection. It is concluded that urban born blacks are less likely than rural born blacks to develop hepatocellular carcinoma, but when they do the tumour is equally likely to be related to infection with hepatitis B virus. The findings lend further support to an important role for chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

There were no significant differences in the accuracy of death certification. The verified asthma mortality in New Zealand (4.2/100,000) was over twice that in England. Many characteristics of patients and management, including poor compliance with treatment and deficiencies in long term and emergency care, were qualitatively similar in the two countries. New Zealand had an apparently higher rate of non-preventable deaths from asthma, suggesting a greater severity of asthma in New Zealand. In both countries, however, most deaths were associated with poor assessment, underestimation of severity and inappropriate treatment (over-reliance on bronchodilators and underuse of systemic corticosteroids), and delays in obtaining help. A greater frequency of some of these deficiencies in management remains a possible additional explanation for part of the excess mortality in New Zealand.\r"

Overall, phototherapy was effective in almost all the infants, with a failure rate of only 2.00/1000 infants. No characteristic features common to all the failures could be detected. The bilirubin rebound was usually mild; repeat phototherapy was required in only 30 infants (7.50/1000), with the response to the second exposure comparable to that to the first. No infant required a third exposure. All the infants tolerated phototherapy well, none developing any illness that could be attributed to the treatment. This clinical experience shows that phototherapy for the treatment of nonhaemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia is effective and safe.\r"

Our objectives were to study the efficacy and safety of beclomethasone and to determine the proportion of patients in whom systemic steroids could be replaced by the new drug. All subjects had a clear history and physical findings of asthma as well as significant improvement in respiratory function after inhalation of salbutamol. Patients were followed for 4 to 8 years. Compared with a baseline period, patients receiving beclomethasone had reduced symptoms and needed less bronchodilator therapy, but their pulmonary function was unchanged. Bronchial biopsy specimens from seven patients who had been taking beclomethasone for as long as 8 years did not differ histologically from specimens from five asthmatic patients who had never taken the drug. Nine patients were able to stop taking systemic corticosteroids within 9 months, eight required them occasionally, and in eight the requirement was substantially reduced; the requirement did not change appreciably in the remaining seven. Inhaled beclomethasone is a safe and effective drug for chronic administration to asthmatic patients, and in 78% of our subjects the need for systemic steroids was substantially reduced or eliminated.\r"

The mean increase in factor VIII level was similar for the two products (1.88% and 1.98% per unit/kg of body weight respectively [p greater than 0.1], or 89% and 95% respectively of the expected increase [p greater than 0.1]). In-vivo survival (the duration of factor VIII in the circulation) was compared after seven infusions of each product. The mean half-disappearance times were 10.7 and 9.1 hours respectively (p = 0.1), and the mean biologic half-lives were 11.6 and 9.9 hours respectively (p = 0.04); the clinical significance of the latter difference is dubious. Both products could be reconstituted satisfactorily from the dried state. Two subjects experienced relatively minor side effects following infusion of one lot of Cutter factor VIII. Individual responses to both products showed considerable variation. Therefore, when it is critical to attain predetermined levels of factor VIII, such as before and after surgery, factor VIII assays should be performed to check the patient's response.\r"

Forearm vascular resistance (mean arterial pressure/FAF) decreased by 72%. The alpha-hANP dose that produced a 50% vasodilator response was 0.093 +/- 0.016 microgram/min/100 ml FAV (n = 11) and it resulted in a venous plasma concentration of ANP (pANP) of 115 +/- 7 pmol/liter (normal 2 to 80; radioreceptor assay). Intraindividually, the maximum dose of alpha-hANP induced an increase in FAF that was 60% of the maximum response to sodium nitroprusside (14.1 +/- 1.8). Combined infusions (n = 9) of maximum forearm vasodilator doses of alpha-hANP and nitroprusside increased FAF to 22.7 +/- 3.4; this additive vasodilator effect of alpha-hANP and nitroprusside is consistent with their different actions on the guanylate cyclase system. In man, the direct vasorelaxant effect of alpha-hANP occurs at concentrations within the upper normal range of pANP, suggesting a physiologic vasodilator role for alpha-hANP.\r"

All the short active peptides (up to 33 AA) isolated after purification of atrial homogenates have the same core of 23 amino acids (Ser 103-ARG 125). The ANF liberated in the medium of cultures of rat atrial cardiocytes is the 26 amino acid Arg 101-Tyr 126. Cloning of the cDNA encoding for ANF and of the rat, mouse, and human ANF gene has been accomplished. ANF has a most potent and short-lasting diuretic and natriuretic effect that appears to be predominantly due to a significant increase in glomerular filtration rate. ANF inhibits the release of aldosterone both in vitro and in vivo. It produces a profound inhibition of vascular contraction induced by norepinephrine and angiotensin II. This vasorelaxation is followed by a prolonged refractory period. ANF administration corrects the hypertension in 2K-1C hypertensive rats and in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Specific high-density binding sites have been found in the brain, especially in the hypothalamus, subfornical organ, median eminence, area postrema, and nucleus tractus solitarius, all areas involved in the brain control of hypertension and in the regulation of salt and water. ANF has no effect on the known sodium transport mechanisms across cell membrane. It has a major effect on the stimulation of guanylate cyclase activity, especially in renal glomeruli. Specific radioimmunoassay procedures have been established and results of preliminary studies that establish clearly that ANF is a circulating hormone are presented.\r"

  ".W": "In order to study the relationship between extracellular and intracellular concentrations of orthophosphate (Pi), phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded, at rest, from the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle of hypophosphataemic patients with vitamin D-resistant rickets, and patients with Paget's disease of bone before and after they had been made hyperphosphataemic by treatment with the drug ethylidene-1-hydroxy-1,1-bisphosphonate. Changes in intramuscular P1 were estimated from the ratio of the areas of the Pi to adenosine 5'-triphosphate peaks. Even though the plasma Pi concentration in these patients spanned a fourfold range (0.5-2.0 mmol/l) the corresponding intramuscular Pi concentration increased by only 70%. A similar effect was observed in erythrocytes, from patients with these disorders, which were incubated in autologous plasma at 37 degrees C, under an atmosphere of O2 + CO2 (95:5, v/v). However, chloride ions, which are transported passively across the cell membrane, showed no change in distribution between cells and plasma, indicating that there was no general effect on passive anion distribution. When erythrocytes from normal subjects were incubated in autologous plasma (1.0 mmol of Pi/l) and in plasma supplemented with Pi (2.3 mmol of Pi/l), the Pi concentration in the cells, at steady state, increased only from 0.57 to 0.78 mmol/l cells, suggesting that the effect was not an artifact of disease or drug therapy. It is concluded that, in human skeletal myocytes and erythrocytes, the percentage change in the concentration of cytoplasmic Pi is lower than that in plasma. This implies that these cells can buffer or regulate cytoplasmic Pi when the extracellular concentration is disturbed.\r"

This 22Na+ efflux rate constant was inversely related to the fasting plasma non-esterified fatty acid level (rs = -0.73, P less than 0.0001). An oral glucose load (40 g/m2 surface area) led to an increase in the leucocyte ouabain-sensitive 22Na+ efflux rate constant after 2 h (1.97 +/- 0.25 to 2.44 +/- 0.19 h-1, P less than 0.0001, n = 11). There was a concomitant fall in the plasma non-esterified fatty acid level. Incubation of leucocytes in vitro with 100 mumol/l linoleic acid inhibited the leucocyte ouabain-sensitive 22Na+ efflux rate constant (1.52 +/- 0.27 vs 0.84 +/- 0.24 h-1, P less than 0.001, n = 8). The leucocyte Na+,K+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na+,K+-ATPase) activity was inhibited in vitro by long chain non-esterified fatty acids, especially when unsaturated. Non-esterified fatty acids may account for some of the Na+,K+-ATPase inhibitory activity of plasma.\r"

  ".W": "Because of large stores of CO2 in different body tissues, metabolic change cannot be detected by measuring gas exchange until the CO2 stores have adapted to the new situation. Similarly, changes in the CO2 stores not due to metabolic alterations, may lead to error in gas exchange measurements. We studied CO2 production (VCO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, where CO2 stores were altered by: a) changing minute ventilation by 15%, b) reducing body temperature, and c) changing the level of sedation. Expired gases went through a mixing chamber and were analyzed continuously by a mass spectrometer. Signals from this instrument, together with gas-volume signals from the ventilator, were fed to a computer for calculation of VO2 and VCO2. Twenty to 120 min were required to reach a stable level, depending on the patient's size and circulatory response. Similar results were obtained by computer simulation using a five-compartment model of CO2 stores. These experiments indicate that measuring VO2 (for calculation of metabolic respiratory quotient [RQ]) in ventilated patients should occur after the patients maintain a 60-min period of stable body temperature and awareness. Ventilatory variables should not be changed substantially during the 90-min period before gas sampling. Cardiac output and muscle blood flow should not have changed 2 to 3 h before measuring RQ. If muscle blood flow is low, the stable periods for body temperature and ventilatory variables should be increased.\r"

Except for more waking in the BERS group, no sleep parameter showed significant differences between the BERS and the control group, but differences existed in comparison to normative values.

Maximum spike/min ratios were related to slow sleep stages, especially delta sleep, and in general to the first cycle. Stages 1-2 on the descending (DESC) slopes of consecutive cycles showed a decrease in spike density during the night, as opposed to the increasing rate of activation of the same stages on the ascending (ASC) slopes.

All patients suffered from multiple seizure types, including complex partial (CP) and tonic-clonic (TC) seizures, in addition to the tonic or atonic episodes. Preoperative seizure frequency was quantified for all types for 1 year immediately before surgery and for the most recent year since the procedure; average monthly counts were obtained for each seizure type. The period of follow-up since surgery averaged 43 months (range, 23-79 months). Statistically significant improvements were documented, not only for the atonic/tonic seizures (p less than 0.0001) for all patients, but also for TC seizures (17 patients; p less than 0.001) and CP seizures (20 patients; p less than 0.02). Six patients experienced an exacerbation of CP seizures postoperatively, and three developed new simple partial (SP) seizures. In all of the CP group and all three of the SP group, ictal video and EEG features suggested that the new seizures were an aborted expression of the previously generalized seizures. From these data, we conclude that callosotomy is an effective treatment for tonic, atonic, and TC seizures intractable to anticonvulsant medications. Three patients became seizure free. The procedure may also be useful for certain specific subgroups of CP epilepsy, but further studies are required before expanding callosotomy to intractable CP seizures not amenable to focal resection.\r"

The subjects were 64 patients admitted consecutively between 1980 and 1986. Their seizures were frequent, more than one a day or more than one a week. The subjects were divided into two groups; 33 patients treated with ACTH and 31 treated with TRH. The mean follow-up periods in TRH and ACTH therapy were 8 months and 3.0 years, respectively. The daily dose of TRH-t 0.5-1 mg was administered intravenously (i.v.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) for 1-4 weeks. The follow-up periods were 3-12 months (mean 6 months). In the TRH group, complete control of seizures was achieved in 7 of 13 (53.7%) of those with infantile spasms, and marked improvement of EEGs were observed in 8 of 13 (61.5%) of them. In the ACTH group, seizure cessation was observed in 75% of infantile spasms. Of the patients who received ACTH, 66.7% had various side effects, including pneumonia, huge subcutaneous abscess, hypokalemia, cataracts, and brain shrinkage as shown on computed tomography (CT), whereas only 16.7% of the patients treated with TRH had transient reduction of urine volume without other laboratory and physical abnormalities. The results of the study indicated that some patients who received TRH had cessation of infantile spasms and improved EEG findings with no serious side effect. Because of the untoward side effects of ACTH therapy, TRH is considered a possible new treatment for children with infantile spasms.\r"

There were no significant differences between drugs in effect on behavior or cognitive function. CBZ caused more systemic problems. There was a trend toward better seizure control with CBZ, but this was not statistically significant. Although individual children in each group had changes in behavior or cognitive status, neither group changed significantly, in either acute or chronic follow-up.\r"

Cognitive functioning was evaluated prior to treatment with zonisamide and repeated after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with zonisamide. At minimum steady-state plasma concentrations greater than 30 micrograms/ml, zonisamide appeared to affect specific cognitive functions such as acquisition and consolidation of new information. Previously learned material, such as vocabulary, and psychomotor performance were not affected. Verbal learning was affected, while visual-perceptual learning was unimpaired. These cognitive effects were observed in the absence of the usual clinical signs and symptoms of toxicity. A linear relationship was found between impairment of cognitive abilities and the minimum plasma concentration (r = -0.73; p less than 0.05). Findings also suggest the development of tolerance to the adverse cognitive effects.\r"

A significant reduction of the total body clearance of both phenytoin and phenobarbital and a higher Cmax value of carbamazepine epoxide and phenobarbital were observed. No modifications were noticed for the kinetic profiles of carbamazepine and valproic acid. These modifications may be of clinical relevance and suggest that, as a general rule, when progabide is added to an established treatment with phenobarbital or phenytoin or carbamazepine, an adjustment of previous posology may be necessary.\r"

Thirty-one women who underwent IVF treatment were enrolled in the study. All patients received clomiphene citrate/human menopausal gonadotropin for ovulation induction. Significant elevations in serum estradiol (E2) levels in the pregnant group were found throughout the cycle interval studied. After hCG administration the serum hCG levels were not different between the groups. Significant elevations in serum progesterone (P) concentrations were found in the pregnant group from the day after laparoscopy through embryo transfer. Embryos obtained from the pregnant group appeared to be different in that the mean number of blastomeres per embryo transferred was significantly greater. Therefore for achievement of an IVF pregnancy the optimal hormone pattern employing combination ovulation induction in the ovulation to transfer interval is a relatively high E2 level in ovulation followed by a high P level at transfer and into the luteal phase. These elevated hormone levels do not depend on the response to exogenous hCG.\r"

For assessment of the physiologic role of the luteal phase LH pulse pattern, this pattern was converted to a follicular pattern in six normal women who used exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone administered with a portable pump (dose 50 to 100 ng/kg subcutaneously every 90 minutes beginning in the early luteal [n = 3] and midluteal [n = 3] cycle phases). There was no significant difference between the treated and the subsequent cycle for luteal progesterone production [186.3 versus 159.0 (ng/ml) day], preovulatory follicular size (23.1 versus 22.5 mm), estradiol levels, luteal phase length (15.6 versus 14.3 days), and daily gonadotropin concentrations including the intercycle FSH rise (160.5 versus 139.1 ng/ml). A follicular phase gonadotropin pulse pattern (increased frequency, decreased amplitude) in the luteal phase had no discernible effects on the corpus luteum or on follicular development in the subsequent cycle.\r"

Medroxyprogesterone acetate (5 mg by mouth twice daily) was added on days 15 to 21. A pause of 7 days followed each of the four treatment periods. Between days 12 to 15 of the first Buserelin cycle, sonograms showed in 17 cases (68%) various degrees of follicular stimulation ranging from numerous 4- to 10-mm follicles (24%), to 10- to 27-mm developing follicle(s) (24%), to greater than 27-mm ovarian cysts (20%). At the fourth Buserelin cycle, the predominant observation was large follicle(s) in the 14-day schedules, whereas ovarian scans did not reveal follicular stimulation in 66% of the 21-day schedules. The area under estradiol (E2) curves was above control in cycles with induced large follicles mainly in the 14-day schedules at the 200 micrograms/12 hour dose. Occasional brief and low elevation of progesterone was compatible with luteinized follicles. In the 21-day schedules at 400 micrograms/24 hours, absence of follicular development was frequently associated with serum E2 in the early follicular phase range. The most appropriate dosage regimen for potential contraception was 200 micrograms/12 hours for 21 days because it was associated with small follicles and serum E2 was in the range of control cycles.\r"

One menstrual cycle of each of 17 women who were 15 and 16 years of age and 12 women who were 25 to 35 years of age was characterized by ultrasonography and hormone measurements. In both groups there was a close correlation between follicle size and serum estradiol concentrations. In the adolescents, follicle development was slower, and an eventual ovulation took place from a smaller follicle than in the older group. The immediate preovulatory follicle size correlated with the maximal serum progesterone concentration during the luteal phase. Late follicular development in adolescents may be related to the slow increase of serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations early in the cycle.\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports have suggested that insulin may not regulate the breakdown of myofibrillar proteins in skeletal muscle. To further test the role of insulin, insulinopenia was produced by treating rats with streptozocin. After treatment, protein breakdown in skeletal muscle was evaluated with the isolated perfused rat hindquarter preparation. After the inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide, total and myofibrillar protein breakdown were assessed by measuring the release of tyrosine and 3-methylhistidine, respectively, in the perfused hindquarters of diabetic and age-matched control rats. Streptozocin-induced (65 mg/kg) diabetes (3- to 28-day duration) resulted in hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, hyperphagia, increased plasma lipid levels, arrested body and muscle growth, and increased urea and 3-methylhistidine excretion. Despite this, protein breakdown in skeletal muscle diminished. The release of 3-methylhistidine by the perfused hindquarters of diabetic rats decreased, whereas the release of tyrosine remained unchanged, suggesting that the breakdown of myofibrillar proteins was affected specifically. 3-Methylhistidine (unbound) levels in skeletal muscle of unperfused diabetic rats as well as in skin decreased, whereas they increased twofold in the gastrointestinal tract. More severe diabetes (125 mg/kg streptozocin), which resulted in ketoacidosis, augmented protein breakdown in muscle; however, this response was due to a marked fall in food consumption (it was also evident when control rats were pair fed). These data reinforce previous conclusions that insulin does not play a major role in the regulation of myofibrillar protein breakdown in skeletal muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87081107\r", 
  ".W": "Studies in rats indicated that the major physiologic stimulus for synthesis of liver glycogen is a rise in the portal glucose concentration after ingestion of a meal. Conversely, glycogen degradation in the liver is stimulated by a rise in portal glucagon concentration. In humans, ingestion of carbohydrate lowers the concentration of circulating glucagon, whereas protein stimulates an increase in peripheral glucagon concentration. Little is known about the effects of these nutrients on glucagon concentrations in the rat. Therefore, we studied the effects of oral protein administration to 24-h-fasted rats pretreated with glucose for 2 h to test the effect of two potent but potentially opposite signals for glycogen metabolism. An increase in liver glycogen concentration was observed in fasted rats given oral glucose, as expected. Removal of glucose by the liver could not account for the glycogen synthesized, indicating that most glycogen formed was derived from gluconeogenesis. In addition, the apparent intracellular and extracellular glucose concentrations were not in equilibrium. A small amount of glucose may have been taken up against a concentration gradient. The portal glucagon was not significantly decreased. Oral protein administration to the rats pretreated with glucose resulted in a rapid and dramatic decrease in liver glycogen concentration. This was associated with an increase in the portal glucagon concentration, no change in insulin concentration, a slight increase in liver cAMP concentration, an increase in the active form of phosphorylase, and a decrease in the active form of synthase. Glycogenolysis could account for the glucose released into the circulation from the liver after protein administration.\r"

  ".W": "Cryopreservation of islets of Langerhans offers a number of important benefits for attempts to cure diabetes by transplantation. In the published literature, a variety of cooling rates, ranging from 0.25 to 75 degrees C/min, in conjunction with warming rates of 4-200 degrees C/min have been proposed to give optimal preservation of islets. In view of the general importance of rates of temperature change in determining survival and because of the possibility of modulating tissue immunogenicity by freezing and thawing, we have studied the interaction of cooling rate and warming rate for isolated rat islets that had been either fully or partially equilibrated with 2 M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Batches of islets were stored at -196 degrees C after cooling at 0.3, 3.0, 10, 30, 60, 150, or greater than 1000 degrees C/min and then warmed at either 10 or 50 degrees C/min. Survival was assessed by measuring the secretion of insulin during static incubation in alternating nonstimulatory and stimulatory media. Cooling rates extending over three orders of magnitude proved not to be a major determinant of survival when the islets were equilibrated with 2 M DMSO: greater than 50% survival was achieved at all cooling rates studied when the warming rate was at 50 degrees C/min. Peak survival (83%) was attained at a cooling rate of 0.3 degrees C/min, but only slightly lower recoveries were obtained at 60 and greater than 1000 degrees C/min. However, in islets only partially equilibrated with cryoprotectants, functional recovery was highly dependent on the cooling and warming rates, with peak survivals after slow cooling and rapid warming. Full permeation of the tissue with cryoprotectant offered maximal recovery of function.\r"

As expected, results from studies with the inhibition of NE biosynthesis with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or radiolabeled NE to measure NE turnover demonstrated significant reductions in SNS activity in IBAT, heart, and pancreas of untreated STZ-induced diabetic rats, compared with those in control rats. MNCV determined with the tail nerve was significantly reduced in untreated STZ-induced diabetic rats, compared with that of the controls. Both daily ARI treatment and insulin therapy in STZ-induced diabetic rats prevented partially but significantly the decrease of NE turnover in IBAT, heart, and pancreas, ameliorated MNCV, and reduced sorbitol accumulation in the nerve tissue and red blood cells. ARI treatment in control rats had no effect on NE turnover, MNCV, or sorbitol content. These results suggest that STZ-induced diabetic rats had not only motor neuropathy but also sympathetic nervous dysfunction and that ARI treatment might prevent these as well as insulin therapy does through the reduction of sorbitol accumulation.\r"

  ".W": "In humans and most other species, a decline in pH of gallbladder contents occurs during the concentration of bile. Recent in vitro studies in rabbit, guinea pig, and Necturus gallbladders have strongly suggested mucosal H+ secretion during sodium reabsorption, presumably representing a Na+/H+ exchange. The present in vivo studies are the first attempt to determine whether H+ secretion by the gallbladder can be demonstrated in the living animal. Gallbladder bile was obtained from 27 anesthetized dogs after 12-24-h fasts; 12 samples of common duct bile were also obtained in 3 dogs during variable taurocholate infusion. In common duct bile, observed ranges were as follows: pH, 7.37-7.85; CO2 partial pressure (PCO2), 21-32 mmHg; total CO2 concentration ([TCO2]), 16.4-41.4 mM; total bile salt concentration ([TBS]), 16-93 mM; and [Na], 153-192 mM. In gallbladder bile, respective ranges were as follows: pH, 5.72-7.29; PCO2, 36-101 mmHg; [TCO2], 1.21-15.5 mM; [TBS], 150-305 mM; and [Na], 199-266 mM. In all samples [Na] was linearly related to [TBS]. Carbon dioxide partial pressure increased from a mean of 27.3 mmHg in common duct bile to greater than 100 mmHg in gallbladder bile at [TBS] = 180 mM, then declined to approximately 36 mmHg as [TBS] increased to greater than 300 mM. Peak PCO2 occurred at pH approximately 6.4-6.6, then declined as pH decreased to approximately 5.7. Bile to plasma PCO2 ratios increased from a mean of 1.08 in common duct samples to greater than 2.0 in gallbladder samples at pH approximately 6.3, then declined to approximately 1.0 in fully concentrated bile. If the high PCO2 values in bile were solely due to tissue CO2 production, a sustained increase in PCO2 throughout Na+ reabsorption might be expected. The results strongly suggest H+ secretion (HCO3- neutralization), as peak PCO2 occurred when [TBS] was only about 180 mM, long before sodium absorption was complete. It is hypothesized that H+ secretion may have important favorable effects on calcium lithogenicity, reducing the likelihood of the formation of CaCO3- containing gallstones.\r"

We have now measured disaccharidase activities cross-sectionally and longitudinally in the jejunal fluid of a group of very preterm neonates of 26-29 weeks gestation who were fed with pasteurised human milk. Lactase activity was within the normal range for older infants and children within the first week of life. Sucrase: lactase ratios fell significantly in the second and third weeks of life, strongly suggesting a further increase in lactase activity. This increase was independent of postconceptional age. Preterm neonates are not as lactase deficient as previously believed, and this has implications in the search for optimal feeding regimes.\r"

Total enteral nutrition was given to 26 as the sole nutritional supply and to 17 in conjunction with a normal ward diet, when appropriate, according to the severity of attack (control group). Nutritional state was assessed and classified in all patients at admission and at the end of the study, by measuring the triceps skinfold thickness, mid arm muscle circumference, and serum albumin concentration as representative of body fat, muscle protein, and visceral protein, respectively. At admission the three nutritional variables were not statistically different between the groups. There was a significantly positive effect on mid arm muscle circumference in patients on total enteral nutrition compared with the control group, but there was no effect on either triceps skinfold thickness or serum albumin concentration. The percentage of subjects requiring intravenous albumin infusion, however, was significantly less in the group fed enterally than in the control group. In addition, fewer patients in the group fed enterally required surgical treatment compared with the control group, despite the fact that one of the criteria for starting enteral nutritional support was the expectancy that surgery would be needed. Total enteral nutrition was well tolerated and no major side effects arose during its use in patients with acute exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

Most of the prospective, randomised, controlled trials testing the value of nutritional support in other diseases, however, have failed to show that this treatment has a beneficial clinical effect. Areas where these trials have shown a possible clinical benefit include the perioperative care of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer, elemental diet treatment of Crohn's disease, and branched chain amino acid infusions in hepatic encephalopathy.

Important differences of response exist between adults and children. Weight loss with changes in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism are well documented. Disturbances of fluid and electrolyte balance are newer areas of interest as are changes in requirements for micronutrients such as trace metals. Many of these metabolic changes are under hormonal control. The intestinal tract shares in the response to malnutrition, and the consequent changes in mucosal function determine the ability of the intestine to handle enteral feeds. Such a route for nutritional support is important in protecting intestinal function not only in absorption but also in hormone production. Enteral feeding is increasingly having an important role in the interactions between acute diarrhoeal disease and malnutrition.\r"

Bilirubin fractionation of duodenal bile prior to transplantation revealed 87.1% unconjugated bilirubin and 12.9% monoconjugates as determined by alkaline methanolysis-high-performance liquid chromatography. Postoperatively, the serum bilirubin concentration quickly fell to normal. Uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase activity in the recipient liver was not detectable. The gallbladder bile bilirubin concentration of 23.9 mg per dl was less than 15% of previously reported normal values. Since devastating kernicteric brain injury is the invariable outcome of Type I Crigler-Najjar syndrome, liver transplantation should be performed when phototherapy cannot maintain the serum bilirubin concentration at an unequivocally safe level.\r"

Both 48-1 and S-1 antibodies reacted in the same manner with liver biopsy specimens from 47 of 50 (94%) chimpanzees with acute or chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis and 15 of 18 (83%) chimpanzees with type D hepatitis. Examinations of serial liver biopsy specimens revealed that the duration of expression of the antigen reacting with the antibodies in hepatocytes of chimpanzees infected with non-A, non-B viruses appeared to be longer than that of chimpanzees infected with the hepatitis delta-virus. By thin-section electron microscopy, the presence of the microtubular aggregates, identical to those previously described for chimpanzees with non-A, non-B hepatitis and shown by immunoelectron microscopy to react with the antibodies, was noted in hepatocytes during the acute phase of hepatitis delta-virus. The antibodies did not react with liver biopsy specimens from chimpanzees acutely or chronically infected with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis A virus, or from normal chimpanzees. The present results confirm our previous observations with the 48-1 and S-1 antibodies. Furthermore, the finding that these two antibodies were also associated with hepatitis D would support the possibility that non-A, non-B agents and the hepatitis delta-virus may have a similar nature or may elicit a similar host response.\r"

Twenty-nine patients in fulminant hepatic failure were studied on admission, and the mean fibronectin level in Grade 0-2 encephalopathy was 82 micrograms per ml (range = 0 to 150) and in Grade 3-4 encephalopathy 61 micrograms per ml (range = 5 to 158) as compared to normal controls (268 micrograms per ml, range = 178 to 380, n = 62). No fibronectin degradation products could be detected in fulminant hepatic failure plasma by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gradient (5 to 15%) followed by immunoblotting onto nitrocellulose with detection using a rabbit antihuman fibronectin antiserum visualized with a peroxidase conjugate. The plasma levels of the marker proteolytic enzyme cathepsin D were significantly elevated in fulminant hepatic failure (120 +/- 31 mU per ml per hr) as compared to the normal controls (18 +/- 2.1 mU per ml per hr, n = 10, p less than 0.01). Cross-immunoelectrophoresis of fulminant hepatic failure plasma for fibronectin on agarose plates gave an additional slower migrating peak in 15 of the 29 patients, as well as that of fibronectin, which corresponded to the fibronectin complex reported by other workers in leukemia. An intermediate gel containing antihuman fibrinogen demonstrated fibrinogen to be one component of this complex. Binding of other substances to fibronectin will reduce its apparent biological activity and may be the result of their lack of clearance by the damaged liver.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the mechanism and pathway of entry of polar nonelectrolytes into bile, we studied first the permeation of [3H]H2O, [14C]urea, [14C]erythritol, [14C]mannitol, [3H]sucrose, [3H]inulin and [3H]dextran across an isolated, in situ perfused segment of the guinea pig's extrahepatic bile duct. All of these molecules, except [3H]dextran, permeated the bile duct. The diffusive permeability coefficients (cm per sec per 10(6) ranged from 248 for [3H]H2O to 1.2 for [3H]inulin. On the basis of these results, we formulated two models of solute biliary excretion. In Model I, permeation across both the canaliculus and ductule/duct was assumed to be by simple diffusion. In Model II, solute was assumed to enter the canaliculus by convection and diffusion, and the ductule/duct by diffusion. Reflection coefficients and/or permeability coefficients for the canalicular membrane were then determined by fitting the equations describing these processes to the bile-to-plasma ratios of [14C] erythritol, [14C]mannitol, [3H]sucrose and [3H]inulin observed at different rates of bile flow produced by partially clamping the bile duct cannula and subsequently infusing taurodehydrocholate. Only when convection was included as a mechanism of canalicular permeation (Model II) was excellent fitting observed. In such a case, the reflection coefficients and permeability coefficients for the carbohydrates in question were similar to those reported for other transporting epithelia. Cholestasis produced by taurolithocholate (10 to 40 mumoles per kg, i.v.) was associated with an irreversible increase in both the sieving coefficient and permeability coefficient for [3H]sucrose and [3H]inulin, even when the inhibition of bile flow was fully reversible. The permeability to [14C] erythritol and [14C]mannitol was either not affected or minimally increased. These findings suggest that, in the guinea pig: solutes as large as [3H]inulin enter the biliary tree both at the canaliculus and bile ductule/duct; [14C]erythritol and [14C]mannitol gain access into the canalicular lumen primarily by convection, whereas [3H]sucrose and [3H]inulin permeate mainly by diffusion; distal permeation of these carbohydrates is small, and accounts for 1 to 11% of their total biliary entry; the canalicular membrane permeability to [3H]sucrose and [3H]inulin is not functionally important in bile secretion, and a fraction of canalicular bile flows through the transjunctional shunt pathway.\r"

Results showed that apolipoprotein AI concentration is highly related to the degree of liver injury, reaching a maximum in patients with steatosis (229 +/- 90 mg per dl), beginning to decrease in patients with fibrosis (188 +/- 88 mg per dl) and reaching a minimum in patients with severe cirrhosis (91 +/- 46 mg per dl).

Increased sensitivity to certain (e.g., hypertensive) stimuli may be limited to a relatively short age period that is usually characterized by the maturation of some important physiological functions. High salt intake seems to influence the animals especially during the weaning period and prepuberty, in the course of which profound developmental changes of circulation, electrolyte metabolism, and neurohumoral regulation have been demonstrated. Indeed, salt-dependent forms of experimental hypertension are more severe when they are induced in immature animals. Moreover, substantial differences in hemodynamics, distribution of body fluids, and involvement of pressor and natriuretic agents indicate that the mechanisms of salt hypertension need not be the same in immature and adult animals. For this reason, increased attention should be paid to developmental factors in the study of induced forms of experimental hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the calcium antagonist diltiazem on diastolic blood pressure and various parameters of erythrocyte membrane cation transport were evaluated in hypertensive patients with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 110 mm Hg in a placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel study. Twenty-one patients completed the study; 13 received placebo, while 8 received diltiazem. Diastolic blood pressure, intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations, ouabain-sensitive Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, and net sodium efflux and potassium influx across red blood cell membranes were examined in both groups at the end of placebo run-in, at the end of the titration phase, and at the completion of study. In the placebo group, none of the parameters changed significantly. In the drug-treated group, diastolic blood pressure declined by approximately 10% (placebo, 95.1 +/- 8.9; drug-treated, 86.9 +/- 4.9 mm Hg; p less than 0.03) at the end of the study. There were also reductions in intracellular sodium (placebo, 7.9 +/- 1.8; drug-treated, 5.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/L cells; p less than 0.002) and calcium (placebo, 13.5 +/- 1.6; drug-treated 10.8 +/- 3.3 mumol/L cells; p less than 0.03) concentrations, accompanied by a simultaneous rise in the activity of the ouabain-sensitive Na+,K+-ATPase of erythrocyte membranes (placebo, 7.1 +/- 1.1 X 10(-2); drug-treated, 9.0 +/- 0.6 X 10(-2) microM inorganic phosphate/hr/mg; p less than 0.001) at the end of the study. However, no significant change in the ouabain-insensitive moiety of the ATPase pump was found. Diltiazem treatment increased net sodium efflux and potassium influx.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Those with a blood pressure decline of 30 mm Hg or more were classified as saralasin-sensitive; those with a decrease of 10 mm Hg or less were considered saralasin-resistant. The animals were then housed in metabolic cages. Groups of sham-operated normotensive, saralasin-sensitive or saralasin-resistant two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) rats were infused with atrial natriuretic factor (Arg 101-Tyr 126), 100 ng/hr per rat, for 6 days. Corresponding control groups were sham-infused. Blood pressure was initially higher in the saralasin-sensitive groups (176 +/- 6 and 181 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively) than in the saralasin-resistant groups (160 +/- 4 and 169 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively). Atrial natriuretic factor infusion produced a gradual decline in blood pressure to 128 +/- 5 mm Hg, but only in saralasin-sensitive 2K1C animals. Urinary volume, initially higher in saralasin-sensitive hypertensive than in normotensive rats, was depressed during atrial natriuretic factor infusion. Urinary sodium excretion and water intake showed the same tendency, but the changes were not significant. No such modifications were observed in saralasin-resistant or sham-operated rats infused with atrial natriuretic factor. Body weight, which was higher in normotensive animals, was unchanged during atrial natriuretic factor infusion. Saralasin-sensitive, noninfused 2K1C rats were the only group with higher plasma renin activity than sham-operated, normotensive controls. Plasma aldosterone was higher in the former than in the other five groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The pituitary and luteal responsiveness of GnRH were studied in 20 normal women at different stages of the luteal phase (LP). Blood samples were collected every 15 min for 180 min before and 120 min after the iv injection of 25 micrograms GnRH. The studies were performed in the early LP (ELP; days 2-3 of LP; n = 5), mid-LP (MLP: days 4-8 of LP; n = 11), late LP (LLP; days 9-12 of LP; n = 13), and premenstrual phase (PMP; days 13-14 of LP; n = 3). Plasma LH, FSH, progesterone (P), and estradiol (E) levels were assayed by RIA. The data were analyzed as integrated secretory area before (ISAb) and after GnRH stimulation (ISAs) and in terms of their percent increase with respect to the basal value. In all studies, GnRH elicited increases in plasma LH and FSH (P less than 0.001). On the other hand, in the ELP, GnRH did not alter steroid ISAs compared to their ISAb, while significant increases in plasma P and E levels were found in the MLP (P, P less than 0.01; E, P less than 0.02) and LLP (P and E, P less than 0.01). In the PMP, two women had no increase in steroid secretion; in the remainder of the subjects, both P and E ISAs markedly increased. This different pattern was not related to basal steroid levels. All women who had a blunted steroid response in the ELP or PMP had a normal secretory response of both P and E when studied at the other LP stages of the same cycle. Furthermore, there was a positive linear correlation between plasma P and E for the ISAb and ISAs values, while the secretory patterns of gonadotropins and steroids were not related to each other. In conclusion, the corpus luteum is able to respond to GnRH to GnRH at a well identified period of the LP. This pattern indicates variable dependence of the corpus luteum on the functional activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of evidence indicate that hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal activity varies among men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). To test the hypothesis that a spectrum of abnormalities of GnRH secretion underlies the syndrome of IHH, we characterized the patterns of GnRH-induced gonadotropin secretion during periods of frequent sampling in 50 consecutive men with IHH and contrasted them with those in 20 normal men. The largest group of IHH patients (n = 42) had no detectable LH or FSH pulsations and could be categorized into 2 subsets according to the presence or absence of evidence of spontaneous puberty. The most severely affected subset (n = 32), who recalled no history of puberty, had testes with a mean volume of 3.3 +/- 0.5 (+/- SEM) ml, with a prepubertal appearance on biopsy, and often were anosmic (n = 17). The second subset of apulsatile IHH men (n = 10) had histories of partial or complete spontaneous sexual development with subsequent isolated loss of sexual function, testes with a mean volume of 13.3 +/- 1.9 ml (P less than 0.01 compared to the first subset), a pubertal or adult appearance of the testes on biopsy, and an intact sense of smell. In a second group of IHH patients (n = 3), LH was secreted predominantly in a nighttime pattern similar to that of normal children during early puberty. These men were aged 18-24 yr, had a mean testicular volume of 10.5 +/- 2.3 ml, pubertal changes on testicular biopsy, and an intact sense of smell. A third group of IHH men (n = 4) had LH pulses of abnormally low amplitude. Only one patient in this group had a history of spontaneous sexual development. The mean testicular volume of these patients was 5.6 +/- 1.9 ml, and the testes appeared prepubertal (n = 3) or pubertal (n = 1) on biopsy. In addition to these groups, another patient had apparent LH pulsations and nearly normal amplitude, but the LH was bioinactive and appeared to consist chiefly of alpha-subunit. Testing of other anterior pituitary hormone functions did not distinguish IHH men from normal men. However, those IHH patients with some evidence of endogenous GnRH secretion had higher basal and stimulated serum PRL levels than IHH men without such evidence (P less than 0.05), suggesting an influence of GnRH on PRL secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The respiratory stimulant properties of iv injections of 33, 67, and 100 micrograms synthetic human corticotropin-releasing hormone (hCRH) were studied in 12 normal men in a single blind, placebo-controlled trial. All doses of hCRH induced a respiratory stimulation in every subject, and the stimulation was dose dependent. The onset of respiratory stimulation occurred within 15-30 sec after hCRH infusion was started. Initially, there was an increase in tidal volume (VT), followed by an increase in respiratory rate. The maximum minute ventilation (VE) occurred 60-120 sec after starting the injection. The 33-micrograms hCRH dose induced a 35% increase in VE from 6.3 +/- 0.6 (+/- SD) to 9.7 +/- 1.3 liters/min (P less than 0.001) due to a marked increase in VT from 531 +/- 105 to 688 +/- 142 ml (P less than 0.001) and only a slight increase in the respiratory rate from 12.4 +/- 3.0 to 14.3 +/- 3.1 breaths/min (P less than 0.001); heart rate was not altered at this dose. The 100-micrograms hCRH dose increased the VE by 81% to 11.5 +/- 1.5 liters/min, mainly due to an increase in VT. VE was elevated for 5.8, 7.2, or 8.3 min after the end of injection of the three hCRH doses. Increases in VE markedly lowered the end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P(ET)CO2; nearly identical with the arterial PCO2 in normal subjects). hCRH (33 micrograms) lowered P(ET)CO2 from 40.3 +/- 1.2 to 37.2 +/- 1.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), and 100 micrograms hCRH lowered P(ET)CO2 to 33.4 +/- 1.2 mm Hg. End-tidal partial pressure of oxygen, i.e. the most sensitive parameter for the duration of action of respiratory stimulation, was elevated for 8.5, 10.2, and 14 min after injection of 33, 67, or 100 micrograms hCRH. Sixty-seven micrograms of hCRH was the lowest effective dose for an increase in the heart rate (from 66.4 to 79.0 beats/min; P less than 0.001), and 100 micrograms hCRH markedly increased the heart rate by 20% to a peak value of 83.5 beats/min. Heart rate increased within 90 sec and returned to the control value after 5-10 min. These data suggest that hCRH is a rapidly acting, dose-dependent, and potent respiratory stimulant. Since this hyperventilatory effect of hCRH occurred in every subject after all doses tested, respiratory stimulation may represent specific biological activity of CRH rather than a side-effect.\r"

  ".W": "We studied GH secretion in a patient with acromegaly and a bronchial carcinoid tumor before and again after surgical removal of this tumor. Before removal of the carcinoid tumor, plasma GH increased slightly after glucose loading (OGTT) and markedly after TRH (650%) and insulin (440%) treatment. Plasma GH did not change after GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), LHRH, or L-dopa administration. Somatostatin (SRIH) infusion lowered plasma GH. No change in plasma immunoreactive GHRH (IR-GHRH) occurred after TRH, glucose, insulin, or SRIH administration. Two weeks after removal of the carcinoid tumor, TRH induced GH secretion (250%) when the IR-GHRH level was undetectable and somatomedin-C was within normal limits. Fifteen weeks after surgery, the patient had normal GH secretion. In conclusion: no pattern of GH secretion is diagnostic of acromegaly due to ectopic GHRH secretion, but the lack of GH response to exogenous GHRH and a large response during hypoglycemia may be features of this condition. When acromegaly and abnormal GH responsiveness are induced by a GHRH-secreting tumor, the increases in plasma GH after TRH, glucose, and insulin administration are not mediated by GHRH. After removal of the GHRH-secreting tumor, persistent paradoxical GH response to TRH does not require abnormally high IR-GHRH levels and does not preclude complete recovery.\r"

This PRL disorder first became manifest postpartum when she had no milk production, and oral metoclopramide failed to raise her serum PRL levels. Her second pregnancy occurred spontaneously after 3 yr of attempts to conceive. During the pregnancy, her serum PRL concentration was very low, varying from 4.5-7.8 ng/ml, and the puerperium was again characterized by alactogenesis. During normal menstrual cycles and after iv GnRH, TRH, metoclopramide, and insulin tolerance tests, serum PRL was only rarely detectable by RIA, at very low concentrations. Bioassay results confirmed the PRL deficiency. The results confirm that PRL is necessary for puerperal lactation and suggest that it is needed for normal ovarian function. The present data also suggest that the maternal pituitary is the main source of serum PRL during pregnancy, and the decidua has only a minor contribution in this respect.\r"

To study glycoprotein hormone gene expression, we prepared specific oligonucleotides complementary to nonhomologous regions of the alpha-subunit and each of the beta-subunit mRNAs encoding human LH, CG, TSH, and FSH. beta-Subunit mRNAs were expressed at relatively low levels in normal pituitary tissue, but were found in greater amounts in pituitary gonadotroph and thyrotroph adenomas. The lengths of the glycoprotein hormone alpha- and beta-subunit mRNAs in normal and neoplastic pituitary tissue were indistinguishable. Expression of different members of the closely related LH beta/CG beta gene family were examined in normal and neoplastic pituitary and placenta using short oligonucleotides complementary to nonhomologous regions of the genes. Although CG beta mRNA was found previously in a pituitary adenoma, none was detected in normal pituitary tissue. In placenta, there was abundant expression of the CG beta gene, but no expression of the LH beta gene, consistent with the acquisition of tissue-specific regulatory sequences in the recently evolved upstream promoter recognition site of the CG beta gene. Primer extension analysis of CG beta mRNA indicated that the same CG beta gene promoter site was used in both normal placenta and JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. Of the two CG beta genes that have been reported to be functional, CG beta gene 5 was preferentially expressed in both normal placenta and the neoplastic JEG-3 cell line. CG beta gene 3 expression accounted for only about 5% of the total CG beta mRNA. The previously uncharacterized human TSH beta and FSH beta mRNAs were studied in normal and neoplastic pituitary tissue. At least two species of FSH beta mRNA were found on Northern blots. Oligonucleotide-primed extension of pituitary mRNA demonstrated that FSH beta mRNA heterogeneity resulted from transcription from distinct promoter sites, encoding 5'-untranslated tracts of 48 and 83 bases. These studies demonstrate that specific oligonucleotide probes distinguish expression of the structurally related glycoprotein hormone beta-subunit mRNAs, allowing analyses of tissue-specific gene expression under different physiological conditions as well as in normal and neoplastic tissues.\r"

Abnormal transport of both T4 and rT3 was demonstrated by reverse flow paper electrophoresis; excess T4 was bound to albumin and prealbumin, while increased binding of rT3 was confined to prealbumin. The three T4-binding proteins in the serum of the subject were isolated by affinity chromatography and characterized. Equilibrium dialysis experiments demonstrated a 20-fold increase in affinity of the albumin for T4 (Ka, 5.1 X 10(6) M-1) and a 4-fold increase in affinity of prealbumin for T4 (Ka, 3.0 X 10(8) M-1); T4-binding globulin affinity was normal. Nine other members of the family were also studied. Two sisters of the propositus have both the abnormal albumin and the variant prealbumin, while a brother has normal T4-binding proteins. The mother has the abnormal albumin alone. The father, his sister, and one of his three brothers have the variant prealbumin only. Despite the presence of the variant prealbumin in some of the paternal relatives of the propositus, their total iodothyronine concentrations were within the normal ranges; the condition may, therefore, often go undetected. The characteristics of the albumin found in the affected members of this kindred are those we have defined for familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia type I, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The pattern of inheritance of the variant prealbumin is also consistent with a dominant mode with strong penetrance. The presence of two separately inherited abnormal T4 transport proteins in the same family suggests that both conditions may be more common than has been thought.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated perfused rabbit hearts that have previously been subjected to in vivo left ventricular myocardial infarction respond to N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or bradykinin (BK) administration with the synthesis of large quantities of eicosanoids. To anatomically localize these synthetic responses we studied the effects of fMLP and BK on eicosanoid synthesis in isolated atria and isolated perfused ventricles from normal and infarcted (4 d in vivo) rabbit hearts. These studies revealed that enhanced agonist-stimulated eicosanoid synthesis occurs largely in the right atria of infarcted hearts, a site distant from the zone of injury. Studies of exogenous arachidonate metabolism in microsomes prepared from various regions of the heart showed that while prostaglandin synthetic capacity is preferentially localized to the right atrium, right atria from normal and infarcted hearts have similar thromboxane and PGE2 synthetic capacity. These results demonstrate that enhanced agonist-stimulated eicosanoid synthesis following rabbit left ventricular myocardial infarction occurs largely in the right atrium, and that this effect is independent of the activity of prostaglandin synthetic enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "The dependence of vascular relaxation on an intact endothelium and the relationship between relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation were determined in coronary arteries isolated from cardiac transplantation patients with or without coronary atherosclerosis. In nonatherosclerotic arteries, the endothelium-dependent agent acetylcholine produced concentration-related relaxations. In atherosclerotic arteries, endothelium-dependent relaxations were abolished with acetylcholine, partly suppressed with substance P and histamine, and completely preserved with the ionophore A23187. In these arteries, the endothelium-independent agent nitroglycerin remained fully active. Accumulation of cyclic GMP in atherosclerotic strips was suppressed with acetylcholine but unattenuated with A23187 and nitroglycerin. In aortas from rabbits with diet-induced atherosclerosis, there was likewise an impaired cholinergic relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation in the presence of preserved responses to A23187 and nitroglycerin. The results demonstrate that impaired cholinergic responses in atherosclerotic arteries reflect a muscarinic defect and not an inability of endothelium to release endothelial factor or smooth muscle to respond to it.\r"

However, a close correlation (r = 0.97) existed between ciliary slowing and pigment content. In a prolonged culture, the increase in activity correlated (r = 0.94) with pigment accumulation. Gel filtration of lyophilized filtrate yielded a single peak of activity corresponding to the pigment fraction. Pyocyanin extracted from an active strain, and 1-hydroxyphenazine were purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and characterized by ultraviolet absorbance spectra and mass spectrometry. Both slowed cilia in a dose-dependent manner, and were synthesized and shown to be indistinguishable from the biological compounds. Pyocyanin caused gradual onset of slowing and ultimate widespread ciliostasis with epithelial disruption. 1-hydroxyphenazine caused rapid onset of ciliary slowing associated with dyskinesia and ciliostasis. Pyocyanin assayed within filtrates accounted for a significant proportion of the bioactivity present.\r"

After 18 h, incubation with both anti-T11(2/3) and rIL-2 resulted in similar levels of enhanced cytotoxicity against NK-resistant as well as NK-sensitive targets. Before and after induction, cytotoxicity was found predominantly within the NKH1+ population. These results suggest that several distinct mechanisms may be capable of enhancing NK activity and that the cells responsible for lymphokine-activated killing are likely to be the same population capable of spontaneous or natural killing before activation in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "To regulate the quantity of respiratory tract fluid, the airway epithelium either secretes chloride, Cl-, or reabsorbs sodium, Na+. Many secretagogues inhibit Na+ absorption, but the decrease may result from a fall in the electrochemical gradient for Na+ absorption. We examined regulation of Na+ absorption independent of Cl- secretion, by bathing canine tracheal epithelium in Cl--free, gluconate Ringers solution. Prostaglandin E2, 2-chloroadenosine, and isoproterenol increased short-circuit current (Isc) and the rate of Na+ absorption. In contrast, indomethacin, which inhibits endogenous prostaglandin production, decreased Isc. These agents regulate cellular levels of cAMP; direct addition of 8-Br-cAMP also acutely increased Isc. We examined chronic regulation of Na+ absorption in cell monolayers grown on permeable supports in serum-free media. Exposure to aldosterone for two days increased baseline Isc by 50% and the amiloride-inhibitable current by 55%. These data indicate that Na+ absorption is both acutely and chronically regulated in the airway epithelium.\r"

In both concentrations highly significant (p less than 0.001) enhancement of fibrinolytic activity was shown, and the enhancement of fibrinolysis was most pronounced during the first 30 minutes of exposure. Stimulation of fibrinolysis was maximal after exposure to the physiological concentration of 10(-9) M, while no further increase was seen using the pharmacological concentration. These results show that adrenaline has a stimulant effect on tissue fibrinolysis in vitro, and this effect may account for the direct stimulation of fibrinolysis by adrenaline in vivo.\r"

The system is based on the principle that when micro-organisms grow in the medium in a sealed bottle their metabolic products create positive pressure. This positive pressure displaces the infected blood and broth into an upper chamber, which acts as a visual signal of microbial activity. All the test micro-organisms, when inoculated at less than 20 colony forming units into simulated human blood cultures, gave a positive signal.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin, adenosine, nifedipine and prostacyclin on restoring coronary perfusion during flow-reducing partial coronary obstruction in anesthetized dogs were studied. Coronary obstruction was obtained by inflation of an intraluminal balloon to decrease coronary blood flow and rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) by approximately 30 to 40 and 10%, respectively. Nitroglycerin (0.01 to 10 micrograms/kg per min) increased coronary blood flow and distal coronary pressure and decreased stenosis resistance associated with improved left ventricular dP/dt depending on its dose. In contrast, adenosine (0.3 to 1.0 micrograms/kg per min) decreased coronary blood flow and distal coronary pressure and intensified stenosis resistance associated with depression of left ventricular dP/dt. Nifedipine and prostacyclin caused divergent effects on the coronary circulation related to each dose. Nifedipine (0.01 and 0.1 micrograms/kg per min) and prostacyclin (0.01 micrograms/kg per min) increased coronary blood flow and distal coronary pressure and reduced stenosis resistance. Nifedipine (1.0 micrograms/kg per min) and prostacyclin (0.3 micrograms/kg per min) did not increase coronary blood flow, but reduced distal coronary pressure and intensified stenosis resistance. Thus, the vasodilators produced different effects on restoration of coronary perfusion during pliable severe coronary stenosis. Nitroglycerin and lower doses of nifedipine and prostacyclin improved coronary perfusion due to selective or preferential dilation of large coronary arteries. Adenosine and higher doses of nifedipine and prostacyclin had deleterious effects on the coronary circulation due to potent arteriolar vasodilation.\r"

Radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction was 30% or less in 33 patients and greater than 30% in 43 patients. Before flecainide, compensated heart failure was present in 23 patients (ejection fraction less than or equal to 30% in 15 and greater than 30% in 8). Flecainide mean dose was 150 mg twice daily and mean plasma concentration was 720 ng/ml. New or worsened congestive heart failure occurred in seven patients on flecainide therapy, all with an ejection fraction of less than 30%; six had a previous history of compensated heart failure and of these, three died. Ejection fraction was the only independent variable that significantly influenced efficacy and tolerance of flecainide. After 1 year of therapy, efficacy and tolerance was 58% (25 of 43) in patients with an ejection fraction greater than 30% and 12% (4 of 33) in patients with an ejection fraction of 30% or less (p less than 0.001). Thus, congestive heart failure can occur during flecainide therapy, particularly in patients with a previous history of congestive heart failure and ejection fraction of less than 30%, and may particularly limit therapy in these patients. Clinical efficacy and tolerance were significantly lower in patients with an ejection fraction of less than 30%.\r"

To identify cell surface molecules involved in human TE-thymocyte rosette formation, we assayed a large panel of monoclonal antibodies for their ability to inhibit rosette formation. We found anti-CD-2 (LFA-2, T11), and anti-LFA-3 antibodies all inhibited binding of TE cells to thymocytes. By using indirect immunofluorescence assays, we determined that cultured TE cells were 90% LFA-3 positive and CD-2 negative, whereas thymocytes were 10% LFA-3 positive and 98% CD-2 positive. Pretreatment of TE cells with anti-LFA-3 but not anti-LFA-2 inhibited TE-thymocyte binding. In contrast, pretreatment of thymocytes with anti-CD-2 but not anti-LFA-3 antibodies inhibited TE-thymocyte binding. Thus TE cell-thymocyte binding is blocked by antibodies to the CD-2 (T11) antigen on thymocytes and by an antibody to the LFA-3 antigen on TE cells. Because the CD-2 antigen has been implicated in T cell activation, these data suggest that a natural ligand for T cell activation via the CD-2 molecule is present on human thymic epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "A small population (10 to 14%) of adult murine thymocytes expresses the glycolipid asialo GM1 (aGM1). Flow cytometric analysis of the aGM1+ cells present in thymus demonstrates the expression of a mature or medullary phenotype by 50% of the aGM1+ cells. Analysis of cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor activity, proliferative capacity, and IL 2 production displayed by aGM1+ and aGM1- thymocyte fractions isolated by cell sorting indicates that these functional compartments of the thymus are contained within the aGM1+ subset. The aGM1+ population also contains virtually all mitotically active thymocytes, as measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. The immature IL 2 receptor-bearing thymoblasts are also included in the aGM1+ population. Immunohistochemical labeling of thymic tissue sections reveals that the majority of aGM1+ cells are located in the medulla. Clusters of aGM1+ cells are found scattered throughout the cortical and subcapsular areas. The aGM1+ population therefore contains the functionally mature thymocytes as well as some immature thymocytes, particularly those that are mitotically active. It is suggested that the aGM1+ subset of thymocytes represents those cells that are mature or actively maturing. This hypothesis is discussed in the context of current concepts of intrathymic T cell differentiation pathways.\r"

The enhancing cells have the surface phenotype of B cells. With the use of several H-2 or Igh congenic mice, it was found that the cooperation among B cells was controlled by both the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and Igh. The capability to generate enhancing B cell activity was analyzed by using tetraparental bone marrow chimeras. (C57BL/6 X BALB/c)F1 mice, for example, were lethally irradiated and were reconstituted with C57BL/6 and BALB/c bone marrow cells. Nine to 12 wk after the reconstitution, the chimeras were immunized with the myeloma protein and were tested for their enhancing B cell activity. After the removal of C57BL/6 origin cells by treatment with anti-H-2b + complement, residual cells exhibited enhancing B cell activity on BALB.B, as well as BALB/c antidextran antibody response. This indicates that the generation of H-2-restricted, idiotype-specific enhancing B cell activity differentiated adaptively so as to recognize foreign MHC as self under chimeric conditions. On the other hand, splenic B cells treated with anti-H-2d + complement did not enhance the responses of BALB/c or BALB.B. Even in a chimeric environment, the B cells of C57BL/6 origin could not obtain the ability to generate enhancing B cell activity upon immunization of the idiotype. The results described here, taken in conjunction with our previous studies, suggest that the Ig heavy chain gene(s) predominantly control the Igh restriction properties of enhancing B cells, and the capability of MHC recognition by B cells is selected under chimeric conditions.\r"

FB were cultured with 250 U/ml IFN-gamma for 4 days to induce HLA-DR expression. Peripheral blood monocytes (M phi), FB, or IFN-gamma-treated FB from the same donor were then cultured overnight with or without the recall antigen streptokinase streptodornase (SKSD), and their capacity to stimulate autologous T4 cell DNA synthesis was examined. SKSD-bearing M phi stimulated T4 cell proliferation, whereas antigen-bearing HLA-DR (+) FB did not. Even after fixation with paraformaldehyde to eliminate metabolic activity, SKSD-bearing M phi, but not FB, were able to function as APC. However, when HLA-DR (-) endothelial cell (EC) or autologous or HLA-D-mismatched M phi were added to the cultures, antigen-pulsed IFN-gamma-treated FB and M phi were comparably effective stimulators of autologous T4 cell DNA synthesis. Antigen recognition by the T4 cell was restricted by the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded gene products expressed by the IFN-gamma-treated FB and was unrelated to the class I or II MHC-encoded gene products expressed by the additional cell type. EC-promoted T4 cell DNA synthesis induced by antigen-bearing IFN-gamma-treated FB was inhibited by 60.3, a monoclonal antibody directed at an epitope common to LFA-1, CR3, and the p150,95 molecule. Inhibition caused by 60.3 was completely reversed by the addition of IL 2 to the cultures. Antigen presentation by IFN-gamma-treated FB was also enhanced somewhat by IL 1, IL 2, or monoclonal antibody directed at Tp44 (9.3). However, each of these additions alone promoted T cell proliferation less effectively than EC and resulted in responses that were smaller than those triggered by antigen-bearing M phi. The data suggest that IFN-gamma-treated FB take up and process antigen effectively, but lack an accessory cell property necessary for antigen-induced T4 cell IL 2 production and proliferation.\r"

We now demonstrate that B cells can specifically stimulate a primary MLR in combination with the phorbol ester, PMA, but not with interleukin 1 (IL 1) or calcium ionophore. The primary MLR induced with B cells plus PMA can be blocked by either monoclonal anti-I-A or anti-L3T4 antibodies. In contrast, thyroid cells that can be induced to express Ia antigens after incubation with interferon-gamma fail to stimulate a primary MLR even in the presence of PMA or IL 1. We confirmed these observations by using the alloreactive T cell hybridoma, HTB-9.3, which does not react to stimulator B cells. In the presence of PMA, however, this I-Ab-specific hybridoma line was able to respond to relevant but not to control stimulator B cells. Furthermore, the response of HTB-9.3 to B cells plus PMA was also blocked by anti-I-A or anti-L3T4 antibody. In contrast to B cells, Ia+ thyroid cells could not activate HTB-9.3 even in the presence of PMA or IL 1. The data indicate that for primary class II restricted allo-responses, B cells provide signals that can be complemented with the phorbol ester PMA, whereas Ia+ thyroid cells do not, suggesting the existence of additional requirements for T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Human thymus is composed of several discrete compartments. Stage III thymocytes, located mainly in the medulla, stain brightly with anti-T3 monoclonal antibody; stage II thymocytes, located in the cortex, are T3- but react with T6 antibodies. The earliest identifiable intrathymic cell (stage I) expresses the sheep erythrocyte glycoprotein T11 but not T6 or T3 antigens. Within the thymus a phenotypically heterogeneous pool of proliferating lymphoblasts is present. This capacity to proliferate without in vitro activation is mainly attributable to thymocytes unable to respond to mitogens and expressing the cortical T6 marker. Both T3+ and T3-T6- cells respond to mitogen. However, in order to exhibit maximal proliferative responses, T3+ but not T3-T6- thymocytes require the addition of exogenous IL 2. Thymocyte subsets at distinct stages of intrathymic differentiation were then analyzed for glucocorticoid (GC) receptor content by using a whole cell assay with 3H-triamcinolone acetonide as tracer. The least mature T3-T6- thymocyte subset contained the highest levels of GC receptors . T3+ thymocytes exhibited a receptor content higher than that found in T6+ cells and similar to that reported for peripheral blood lymphocytes. Apart from the number, the GC receptor sites in all thymocyte subsets were similar in their affinities, kinetic characteristics, specificity for steroids, and ability to undergo translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus, and they behave in all these respects like binding sites of GC receptors in lymphoid and other cells. Independently of both phenotype and GC receptor content, all in vivo activated thymocytes (i.e., spontaneously proliferating cells) were similarly sensitive to the steroid inhibitory action in vitro. Both in the presence and in the absence of exogenous IL 1 or IL 2, the PHA-induced mitogenesis of T3-T6- cells was less inhibited by GC than that of T3+ thymocytes. Exogenous IL 1 and IL 2 were equally effective in removing, although not completely, the GC inhibition on T3-T6- proliferative responses to PHA. Relative to T3+ cell mitogenesis, only exogenous IL 2 was able to antagonize the steroid inhibitory action. The capacity observed in vitro of GC to differentially affect the proliferative potential or the cell viability of thymocytes belonging to functionally distinct subsets suggests that these hormones could regulate the intrathymic maturative pathways. Finally, although at present the physiologic relevance of the highest expression of GC receptors in intrathymic precursor cells remains unclear, the receptor density may be considered a marker of differentiation for the T lymphoid lineage.\r"

  ".W": "Host-vs-graft activity presents a major obstacle for transplantation of T cell-depleted bone marrow in HLA-mismatched patients. In a primate model, conditioned exactly like leukemia patients, it was shown that residual host clonable T cells, as well as alloreactive cytotoxic precursors, were present in peripheral blood and spleen after completion of cytoreduction. We have now extended this study in a mouse model for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. C3H/HeJ mice were treated by 9 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), and 24 hr later their spleen cells were cultured in the presence of T cell growth factor and phytohemagglutinin according to the limit dilution procedure. After 7 days of culture the average frequency of clonable cells was 2.5 X 10(-3) compared with 37 X 10(-3) in the spleens of normal mice. The T cell derivation of the growing cells was ascertained by complement-mediated cytotoxicity with anti-Thy-1 as well as with anti-Lyt-2 and anti-Ly-3T4. In parallel, we found that the initial engraftment rate of bone marrow allograft in mice given 9 Gy TBI was lower than that found in recipients of syngeneic marrow. The initial engraftment rate was measured by the number of colony-forming units in the spleen and by splenic uptake of 125IUdR. A slight increase in TBI from 9 Gy to 11 Gy markedly reduced the difference in the number of spleen colony-forming units or the IUdR uptake between recipients of allogeneic and syngeneic bone marrow. This increase in TBI also coincided with eradication of detectable clonable T cells. Moreover, in mice transplanted with T cell-depleted bone marrow after 9 Gy TBI, we also demonstrate that cytotoxicity against donor-type target cells is present in the spleen 10 to 14 days posttransplantation, whereas in mice treated by 11 Gy TBI such alloreactivity could not be detected. These results suggest that resistance to T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow in irradiated mice closely correlates with the frequencies of residual host clonable T cells detectable by conventional immunologic assays.\r"

The kinetics of expression of the IL 2 receptor closely correspond to the proliferative response, as assessed by IUdR radioisotope uptake. The expression of IL 2 receptors correlated with the proliferative response profile of the murine strains surveyed during a study of responses to picryl chloride. Neither immune compromised 4-mo-old MRL/lpr mice nor athymic nude mice generated significant antigen-specific proliferative responses or IL 2 receptor expression after antigen sensitization. Mice rendered specifically unresponsive to antigen displayed reduced proliferative responses to the tolerizing antigen, as well as reduced numbers of IL 2 receptor-positive cells. Finally, the treatment of mice with immunosuppressive drugs reduced both the proliferative responses as well as the number of IL 2 receptor-positive cells. However, at the cellular level, the drugs produced different effects on IL 2 receptor expression.\r"

The addition of IL 3 to IL 2-dependent cell lines did not alter the expression of the IL 2 receptor.

  ".U": "87084778\r", 
  ".W": "In vivo administration of recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) was previously shown to result in activation of the microbicidal activities of peritoneal macrophages (PM phi). Because macrophages at different anatomical sites vary in their functional capacities, we considered it of interest to determine whether administration of murine rIFN-gamma, either in vitro or in vivo, can enhance the microbicidal activity of resident alveolar macrophages (AM phi) and to compare the effects of rIFN-gamma on AM phi and PM phi. After incubation in vitro with rIFN-gamma, the antimicrobial activities of both murine AM phi and PM phi were enhanced, as assessed by their ability to inhibit replication of the intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. This effect was dose dependent for AM phi over a range of 0.1 to 1 U/ml and for PM phi over a range of 0.5 to 1000 U/ml. In this assay, the minimum dosage required for in vitro activation of AM phi was one-half that required for activation of PM phi, suggesting a greater sensitivity of AM phi to the in vitro activity of rIFN-gamma. Macrophages from both anatomical sites were also activated when rIFN-gamma was administered in vivo. This effect was dose dependent over a range of 10(3) to 10(5) U/mouse. Freshly harvested AM phi and PM phi from mice injected 24 hr earlier with 10(4) U rIFN-gamma by either the i.v. or i.p. routes markedly inhibited intracellular multiplication of Toxoplasma. In contrast, AM phi and PM phi from control mice permitted fourfold to ninefold increases in numbers of intracellular Toxoplasma. The anti-toxoplasma activity of AM phi and PM phi gradually diminished over a period of 3 days when assayed at successive 24 hr periods after a single i.v. injection of rIFN-gamma. At 3 days after injection, a substantial loss of anti-toxoplasma activity was observed with PM phi as compared with controls; residual anti-toxoplasma activity was still demonstrable in AM phi at 3 days. These results demonstrate that in vitro as well as in vivo treatment with rIFN-gamma confers on AM phi an enhanced antimicrobial activity. These findings provide a rationale for evaluating rIFN-gamma in the treatment of pulmonary infections, especially those due to opportunistic pathogens against which AM phi play a major role in host defense.\r"

In these studies we stimulated rabbit chondrocytes with various cytokines in vitro in order to determine which were responsible for changes in the release of prostaglandin, plasminogen activator, and a metalloproteinase. The metalloproteinase assayed in these studies is a latent enzyme whose activity can rapidly be measured with fluorogenic casein. Conditioned media from stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells; purified human monocyte IL 1, pI 7,6, and 5; and recombinant human IL 1, beta or alpha forms, all changed the secretory pattern of rabbit articular chondrocytes in a similar manner: production and secretion of a latent metalloproteinase(s) and prostaglandin E were stimulated in a concentration-dependent fashion, whereas the activity of plasminogen activator was strongly reduced. Antibodies against human monocyte IL 1 blocked the active principle in various mononuclear cell-conditioned media, suggesting that uncharacterized factors present in these supernatants do not affect the metalloproteinase response. When added to confluent chondrocytes, phorbol myristate acetate, concanavalin A, IL 2, lipopolysaccharide, indomethacin, and prostaglandin E2, which interfere with lymphocyte proliferation assays for IL 1, failed to influence chondrocyte metalloproteinase secretion. Recombinant human IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma in the presence or absence of IL 1 had no effect on rabbit chondrocytes, whereas recombinant human tumor necrosis factor decreased plasminogen activator but had no effect on prostaglandin or metalloproteinase production. These results support the concept that IL 1 specifically induces chondrocytes to produce metalloproteinases, and hence may play an important role in destructive joint diseases.\r"

The initial activation stimulus to Ts is provided by alloantigen binding; after this binding, Ts are functionally responsive only for a period of hours to the additional stimulus provided by TsDF. The present studies addressed the possibility that MLR-Ts responsiveness to TsDF reflects the induced and transient display of TsDF-binding receptors. TsDF receptor expression was investigated by determining the capacity of TsDF-responsive MLR-Ts to adsorb TsDF activity and to respond to that TsDF pulse by TsF production. Primed Ts populations that were alloantigen restimulated for 8 hr adsorbed TsDF in a cell dose-dependent fashion and produced TsF in response to that adsorption, whereas alloantigen-stimulated naive cells or primed but nonrestimulated cells neither responded to nor bound TsDF. Primed and restimulated L3T4-Ly-2+ but not L3T4+-Ly-2--enriched T cells bound TsDF. TsDF adsorption was saturable and time and temperature dependent. Glutaraldehyde fixation did not prevent TsDF adsorption by restimulated MLR-Ts, whereas pronase treatment abolished their TsDF-binding capacity. Kinetic analyses demonstrated that the capacity to bind TsDF developed rapidly after alloantigen reexposure, with maximal binding within 8 hr, followed by rapid decay with loss of TsDF binding by 36 hr. The kinetics of TsDF-induced TsF production correlated precisely with those of TsDF binding. These observations provide strong evidence that TsDF affects primed alloantigen-reactive Ts by interaction with antigen-induced and transiently expressed cell surface receptors. TsDF-receptor binding is then the stimulus for expression of Ts effector function.\r"

  ".W": "We have analyzed the role of membrane potential on T cell activation and cell proliferation. Depolarization of T lymphocytes, by increasing the extracellular concentration of K+ during a 1-hr exposure to PHA, results in a marked inhibition of cell proliferation. In parallel, depolarization of T cells prevented the normal increase in [Ca2+]i seen after PHA binding. In depolarized cells, PHA failed to induce IL 2 secretion, but, in contrast, IL 2 receptor expression was triggered normally and the cells were subsequently responsive to exogenous IL 2. Increasing [Ca2+]i in depolarized cells with the ionophore ionomycin, or bypassing the requirement for an increase in [Ca2+]i with TPA, restored the PHA-induced proliferative response in depolarized cells. These data confirm that a membrane potential-sensitive step, namely, Ca2+ influx and the resulting change in [Ca2+]i, is triggered by PHA. The inhibitory effects of depolarization are mediated through the impairment of IL 2 secretion, but not IL 2 receptor expression. T cell proliferation can therefore be regulated by altering membrane potential, which in turn modulates the extent of the change in [Ca2+]i. This study suggests a role for transmembrane potential in the regulation of the T cell proliferative response.\r"

Eosinophils were stimulated with 2.5 microM A23187 in the presence of 20 mM L-serine, a hypochlorous acid scavenger that prevents the oxidative metabolism of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes. Total production of immunoreactive LTC4, the sum of intra- and extracellular LTC4, was complete within 5 to 10 min. At 5, 10, and 30 min, 65.9% +/- 15.2, 42.3% +/- 24.3, and 5.5% +/- 3.9, respectively, of the total amount of LTC4 measured remained intracellular as detected after the media and cells were separated and the latter was extracted with methanol. The time course for the intracellular synthesis and extracellular release of immunoreactive LTC4 from eosinophils pretreated with 5 micrograms/ml cytochalasin B and stimulated with 0.5 microM FMLP was like that obtained with ionophore, although the total LTC4 production was only approximately 10%. The identity of the intracellular LTC4 was confirmed by elution with reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography followed by scanning UV spectroscopy, radioimmunoassay, and bioassay. Eosinophils that were stimulated with A23187 in the absence of L-serine metabolized newly synthesized LTC4 to 6-trans-LTB4 diastereoisomers and subclass-specific diastereoisomeric sulfoxides that were identified only in the extracellular medium. Thus the response of purified eosinophils to two different stimuli demonstrates a transient intracellular accumulation of biologically active LTC4, the distinct extracellular release, and the apparent limitation of oxidative metabolism to the extracellular location.\r"

Because macrophages exert their immunoregulatory activity in part by generation of oxygenated arachidonic acid metabolites, we systematically studied arachidonic acid transformations by purified guinea pig Langerhans cells and compared them with mixed epidermal cells and Langerhans cell-depleted keratinocytes. Products formed from arachidonic acid by cell homogenates were measured after thin-layer or reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatographic separation. In addition, leukotriene B4 and C4 formation was assessed in supernatants of Ca ionophore A23187-challenged intact cells by radioimmunoassay. Mixed epidermal cells converted arachidonic acid predominantly via cyclooxygenase and 12-lipoxygenase pathways. The main products were prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-Hete), although significant amounts of PGE2, PGF2 alpha, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were formed as well. PGD2 synthesis was dependent on the presence of reduced glutathione. The product spectrum formed by Langerhans cell-depleted keratinocytes was virtually indistinguishable from mixed epidermal cells. In contrast, Langerhans cells showed a markedly different metabolism of arachidonic acid. They exhibited an exceedingly high PGD2-generating capacity, whereas only minor amounts of 12-HETE and very low amounts of other prostaglandins were synthesized. The PGD2/12-HETE ratio was 1.22 for mixed epidermal cells and 4.37 for Langerhans cells. Leukotriene production from exogenous or endogenous arachidonic acid could not be demonstrated by either radioenzymatic or radioimmunologic detection methods. We conclude that guinea pig Langerhans cells transform arachidonic acid predominantly to PGD2, which might mediate significant immunoregulatory, inflammatory, and antitumoral activity in the skin.\r"

It was shown previously that TPA induces the expression of the interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptor and the T3 complex on some T cell lines, including CCRF-CEM. We demonstrate that expression of the IL 2 receptor correlated with an induction of the 3.5 and 1.5 kb IL 2 receptor mRNA. In addition, the TPA-induced expression of the T3 polypeptides was found to be accompanied by induction of a putative T cell antigen receptor heterodimer on CEM cells. This was demonstrated by the co-precipitation of the T cell receptor with T3 from digitonin-solubilized cells. The cells expressed high levels of T3 delta- and T cell receptor beta-chain mRNA in the absence of TPA. The effect of TPA was to cause a rapid accumulation of T cell receptor alpha-chain mRNA. This suggested that the alpha-chain gene was rearranged before TPA induction and that expression of the T cell receptor/T3 complex on the cell surface was regulated by the level of alpha-chain expression. It was also shown that cloned sublines of CEM cells which expressed different T cell antigen phenotypes differed in their response to TPA.\r"

A673 cells were shown to be susceptible to the cytotoxic action of purified recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF). A673 cells were also highly sensitive to the cytotoxic action of peripheral blood monocytes. Clones of A673 cells sensitive and resistant to TNF were isolated and characterized for their sensitivity to monocyte killing. A good correlation was found between the sensitivity of these clones to the cytotoxicity of TNF and their susceptibility to killing by monocytes. A TNF-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb) reduced monocyte killing of parental A673 cells and of a TNF-sensitive clone of A673 cells. Inhibition of monocyte killing by this MAb was particularly pronounced at a low effector to target cell ratio. HT-29 cells were relatively resistant to the cytotoxic action of recombinant TNF and to monocyte killing. Treatment of HT-29 cells with recombinant human IFN-gamma increased their susceptibility to both TNF cytotoxicity and monocyte killing. In addition, MAb to TNF inhibited monocyte killing in HT-29 cells sensitized by incubation with IFN-gamma. Our data show that TNF is an important mediator of the cytotoxicity of human monocytes for tumor cells and that IFN-gamma can increase monocyte cytotoxicity by sensitizing target cells to the lytic action of TNF.\r"

The expression of cCD3a and cCD3c in the perinuclear and Golgi area of large, BrdU-incorporating, strongly TdT+ thymic blasts probably represents one of the earliest signs of T cell commitment, because these blast cells are CD1-, CD4-, CD8-, and mCD3-. The cCD3+, TdT+ cells are normally restricted to the thymus and are absent among the TdT+ cells of bone marrow. The anti-CD3b Ab used, T10B9, co-caps and co-modulates with the other anti-CD3 Ab and is a T cell-specific reagent at a membrane level but does not bind to perinuclear cCD3. Instead, this reagent cross-reacts with a filamentous cytoplasmic network in non-T cells in man and in primates S. oedipus and M. rhesus despite their T cell negativity for mCD3. The characteristics of all T-ALL cases studied: cCD3+, CD7+ along with nuclear TdT+ suggest lineage fidelity to early thymic blasts. As a marked contrast, cCD3 is absent in common ALL and in AML, including cases that concomitantly express CD7 and myeloid antigens. Thus, the cCD3, TdT combination provides a very sensitive assay for residual T-ALL blasts outside the normal thymus.\r"

  ".W": "Primary cultures of mouse epidermal cells are induced to terminally differentiate when extracellular calcium levels are increased to more than 0.1 mM. After carcinogen treatment, cellular foci can be selected that resist this calcium signal to terminally differentiate. Calcium causes these foci to stratify; however, in contrast to normal epidermis, DNA-synthesizing cells in these foci are found in the suprabasal cell layers as well as in basal cells. Cell lines derived from these foci may be considered to be putative initiated cells. Three of these cell lines, designated 308, D, and F, have been characterized for their response to calcium and phorbol ester tumor promoters. The formation of cornified cells and the activity of epidermal transglutaminase were utilized as markers of epidermal differentiation. Neither calcium nor the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) increased transglutaminase activity or cornification of any of the 3 lines. Proliferation was estimated by the [3H]thymidine labeling index, by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA, and by a clonal growth assay. Unlike primary normal cultures, raising the calcium level of the medium did not markedly reduce the rate of proliferation of any of the 3 cell lines. In 2 of the lines, line 308 and line D, proliferation increased in response to TPA exposure. In line F, [3H]thymidine incorporation in confluent cultures was inhibited by TPA, while in cells plated at clonal densities, TPA was cytotoxic at doses of 5 ng/ml or higher. If these calcium-resistant epidermal cell lines correspond to initiated cells, their lack of sensitivity to the induction of terminal differentiation by TPA could account for their growth relative to normal cells. Those lines that also respond to stimulation of proliferation by TPA to a greater extent than normal cells would have a further growth advantage.\r"

The stability of the marker within a given strain in vivo was established during experimental infection in the chronic rat lung model of pseudomonas pneumonia. P. aeruginosa serially cultured from individual patients with cystic fibrosis were examined by using this marker. Isolates that varied in colonial morphology, serotype, and biotype were identical when analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using the fragment as a probe.

The resulting strain--SL3261(pXY411)--expressed GZ as an intracellular antigen. The plasmid was stable in vitro and in vivo and did not significantly alter the behavior of strain SL3261 in mice. Animals intravenously vaccinated with this construct developed circulating antibodies to GZ, as measured by ELISA, and delayed hypersensitivity to the antigen injected in the footpad. These results indicate that attenuated salmonellae may be expected to elicit both humoral and cellular responses to intracellular cloned antigens.\r"

Cholesterol level in VLDL, LDL, HDL2, and HDL3 fractions was determined after separation of these fractions by density gradient ultracentrifugation. HDL-cholesterol is the sum of cholesterol in HDL2 and HDL3. Cineangiography yielded scores for CAS and for left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF). On univariate regression CAS was correlated weakly with LDL-cholesterol (positive) and with HDL3-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol (negative), and more strongly with LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (positive), but not with HDL2-cholesterol. LVEF was correlated positively with HDL3-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, apo-AI, and apo-AII. Of other \"risk factors,\" none was correlated with CAS, and a history of previous myocardial infarction (PMI) was the only one significantly correlated with LVEF. CAS itself was also correlated negatively with LVEF. In multiple regression analysis with two or three independent variables, the relation of HDL(3)-cholesterol with CAS remained significant when other risk factors were taken into account. LVEF remained related positively with HDL(3)-cholesterol, apo-AI, or apo-AII, when either of them was tested in combination with other risk factors; of these only PMI made a significant independent contribution. Conclusions for this patient group (with low HDL-cholesterol): HDL3-cholesterol, and not HDL2-cholesterol, is informative for CAS; HDL(3)-cholesterol, apo-AI, or apo-AII, as well as CAS and PMI, are associated with LVEF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The secretion of tissue-type plasminogen activator antigen (t-PA Ag) and fast-acting plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (PA-I activity) was measured in the conditioned medium after incubation of confluent cultures with serum-free medium for 24 hours (1.5 ml/25 cm2 cell surface). The baseline production of t-PA Ag was 2.7 +/- 1.4 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) and of PA-I activity 36 +/- 18 IU/ml. Stimulation with thrombin resulted in a dose-dependent and time-dependent increase of the secretion of both components. At 1 NIH U thrombin per milliliter, a fourfold increase of t-PA Ag and a twofold increase of PA-I activity were observed. This effect was dependent on a free active site in thrombin and specific protein synthesis (inhibited by cycloheximide and dactinomycin) but unrelated to prostacyclin synthesis (no effect of aspirin or indomethacin). No free t-PA activity could be demonstrated on fibrin plates in conditioned medium from either stimulated or nonstimulated endothelial cell cultures. Endotoxin stimulation resulted in a specific secretion of PA-I activity but not of t-PA Ag, whereas histamine stimulation at concentrations of 0.1 to 1 mumol/L caused a specific secretion of t-PA Ag but not of PA-I.

  ".W": "Technetium-99m-labeled pyrophosphate and radiolabeled antimyosin antibodies are two infarct localizing agents with apparently different kinetics of localization. To determine whether these agents localize in a similar fashion in early acute myocardial necrosis, we studied the simultaneous distribution of 111In-labeled antimyosin and 99mTc-labeled pyrophosphate in dogs after intracoronary (i.c.) (n = 9) or intravenous (i.v.) (n = 9) administration of a mixture of these two agents in a reperfused infarct model. The mean infarct size (+/- s.d.) delineated by pyrophosphate [20.2 +/- 14.1 (i.v.), 29.8 +/- 12.3 (i.c.)] was larger than that by antimyosin [14.2 +/- 11.3 (i.v.) (p = 0.05), 20.0 +/- 11.8 (i.c.) (p = 0.05)] which was larger than that by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride [13.9 +/- 8.0 (i.v.) (p = 0.05), 15.3 +/- 6.5 (i.c.) (p = 0.05)]. This overestimation persisted whether the radiopharmaceuticals were administered by intracoronary or intravenous injections, although the latter with antimyosin was only slightly larger (TTC:AM = 13.9:14.2) (p = n.s.). There was a good correlation, however, between antimyosin and pyrophosphate delineated infarct sizes in dogs with intracoronary injection (y = 0.82x + 13.33, r = 0.79) or i.v. injection (y = 1.208x + 3.01, r = 0.97) of the mixture of the two agents. Since the images of the 111In and 99mTc activities were obtained consecutively by identical methods, the overestimation of infarct size by pyrophosphate cannot be due to differences in spatial resolution of the techniques used. The differences in the areas of myocardial damage delineated by pyrophosphate and antimyosin in our study most probably denote the area of viable but compromised myocardium.\r"

However, the mechanism of such ionophore-mediated transport of 111In through a lipid bilayer membrane is not completely clear. The present report describes the correlations of the behaviors of ionophoric loading of 111In into liposomes with the lipophilicity and the indium-binding affinity of three ionophores, namely, 8-hydroxyquinoline, acetylacetone, and tropolone. Our results suggest that the mechanism of the ionophoric transport of 111In through a lipid bilayer membrane involves the rapid exchange of 111In cations among the ionophores in both the aqueous solution and the lipid bilayer. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an ionophore in facilitating the transport of 111In from the external aqueous compartment to the entrapped nitrilotriacetic acid depends not only on the lipophilicity of the [111In]ionophore complex, but also on the lipophilicity of the free ionophore itself and the competition of 111In between nitrilotriacetic acid inside the inner aqueous compartment of the liposome and the ionophore imbedded in the lipid bilayer membrane of the liposome.\r"

ODS- +/+ rats (+/+ rat), which can synthesize ascorbic acid, were used as controls. In OD rats, the dietary requirement of ascorbic acid to maintain normal growth and prevent any signs of scurvy is about 300 mg of ascorbic acid per kilogram diet. In this study, dietary levels of ascorbic acid tested were 0, 50, 300, 1000 and 3000 mg ascorbic acid per kilogram diet with or without 200 mg of PCB per kilogram diet. Feeding PCB did not affect growth in rats of either genotype. When statistical analysis was done within groups fed diets without PCB, ascorbic acid deficiency caused significant decreases in body weight gain, hepatic activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes and level of hepatic cytochrome P-450. When OD rats were fed a diet without PCB, the supplementation of about 300 mg ascorbic per kilogram diet was sufficient to maintain normal activities of hepatic aminopyrine N-demethylase, aniline hydroxylase, cytochrome c reductase and reduction of cytochrome P-450 and a normal level of hepatic cytochrome P-450. However, when OD rats were fed a diet supplemented with 200 mg PCB per kilogram of diet, significantly higher activities of hepatic aminopyrine N-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase and significantly higher level of hepatic cytochrome P-450 were observed in OD rats fed a diet supplemented with 1000 mg or 3000 mg ascorbic acid per kilogram of diet than in rats fed a diet supplemented with 300 mg of ascorbic acid. It is concluded that the dietary requirement of ascorbic acid is increased severalfold by the administration of xenobiotics, such as PCB, for the maximum induction of hepatic drug metabolism.\r"

Forty weanling female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to each of nine diets fed ad libitum. After 4 wk each rat received DMBA (20 mg/kg) via gastric intubation. For an additional 22 wk after carcinogen administration all rats consumed a diet containing 16% of dietary energy from protein and 24% from fat. Dietary fat, protein and ad libitum energy consumption exhibited statistically significant effects on final tumor prevalence, but interactive effects were not found. At necropsy, rats fed corn oil at 12, 24 and 48% of energy prior to DMBA administration showed tumor prevalences of 58, 58 and 85% with 116, 153 and 231 total tumors, respectively. The data indicate a significant nonlinear effect of dietary fat. Corresponding numbers for rats fed casein at 8, 16 and 32% of energy prior to DMBA were prevalences of 79, 65 and 59%, with total tumor counts of 194, 144 and 162. Higher dietary protein during the initiation phase was associated with a significant reduction in tumor prevalence, which was most striking between 8 and 16% of energy from protein. In addition, results of multiple logistic regression showed that tumorigenesis was increased with greater ad libitum energy intake. The odds of a tumor at necropsy were multiplied by 1.19 for each kilocalorie increase in ad libitum energy intake averaged over the post-DMBA phase of the experiment. An additional six weanling rats fed each diet for 4 wk were killed for assay of hepatic carcinogen metabolizing enzymes at the time corresponding to DMBA administration in the initiation experiment. Both protein and fat showed independent effects on the activity of several enzymes. However, enzyme activity did not suggest a unifying mechanism whereby these nutrients influence DMBA-induced mammary carcinogenesis.\r"

After weaning (d 21), normal and undernourished rats were fed a 20% protein diet until 90-120 d of age, when the rats were subjected to a short shuttle avoidance session and/or killed for neurochemical analyses. During shuttle avoidance sessions, footshock escape and footshock avoidance responses were analyzed simultaneously using 0.2- or 0.8-mA footshock intensity. In addition, the effect of undernutrition during suckling on phosphoryl-serine (P-Ser) level in brain nuclear proteins and the response of this level to a shuttle avoidance session were studied. We observed that undernutrition during suckling had no effect on footshock avoidance responses and decreased the latencies of footshock escape responses using 0.2-mA footshock intensity. Undernutrition decreased the basal level of P-Ser in brain nuclear proteins and abolished the decrease of this level observed in a shuttle avoidance session in normal rats using 0.2- or 0.8-mA footshock intensity.\r"

For pneumonia and sepsis, the third-generation cephalosporin evaluated (ceftizoxime) was found to be less expensive than other regimens, when costs of dose preparation and administration, monitoring, and toxicity were added to drug acquisition costs. The lowest-cost regimen for intra-abdominal infection was metronidazole plus gentamicin. Modest differences in efficacy would easily outweigh differences in toxicity, however, and could justify the use of more expensive regimens (e.g., mezlocillin plus gentamicin for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and cefoxitin plus gentamicin for intra-abdominal infection). If all regimens are assumed to be equally efficacious, then the third-generation cephalosporin was both lowest in cost and, owing to its low toxicity, greatest in net health benefit.\r"

Capnography proved to be a sensitive and accurate method for detecting apnea and airway obstruction using the continuous display of the CO2 waveform. All episodes of apnea or obstruction were immediately detected as the respired CO2 level fell to zero baseline. The end-tidal CO2 (PetCO2) obtained via nasal prong sampling was not significantly different from the PaCO2. PetCO2 values served as useful indicators of hypoventilation. During steady-state conditions of respiration, transcutaneous oxygen tensions (PtcO2) correlated well with simultaneously measured PaO2 (r = 0.93). However, during any period when oxygenation was rapidly changing (step increase in FIO2, step decrease in FIO2, or apnea) the PtcO2 lagged behind changes in PaO2 even after a five-minute equilibration period, thereby not accurately reflecting the true state of oxygenation. Consequently, the transcutaneous oxygen monitor does not appear to be optimal as a respiratory monitor in the setting of ultralight general anesthesia where rapid, critical changes in oxygenation must be detected without delay.\r"

Integrated plasma samples were collected for 80 min before and 120 min after nasogastric intubation of alcohol (2.5 or 3.5 g/kg) or isocaloric sucrose control solution. Then synthetic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH; 100 micrograms/i.v.) was administered and plasma samples were collected for an additional 180 min. After sucrose control administration, LHRH stimulated a significant increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) within 30 min (P less than .001) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) within 60 min (P less than .01). After alcohol administration, LHRH stimulated LH and FSH also increased significantly (P less than .01) when blood alcohol levels averaged 242 (+/- 26) and 296 (+/- 20) mg/dl. Moreover, there was an alcohol dose-dependent increase in LHRH-stimulated LH (P less than .01, .001) in comparison to control conditions, even though prealcohol and presucrose LH levels were equivalent. LHRH-stimulated FSH was also higher after 3.5 g/kg of alcohol than after 2.5 g/kg of alcohol and sucrose control administration (P less than .001) but base-line FSH levels before 3.5 g/kg of alcohol were also higher than control (P less than .05) or 2.5 g/kg of alcohol (P less than .001). An alcohol related enhancement of LHRH-stimulated LH without concomitant suppression of FSH in ovariectomized females contrasts with data reported previously in normally cycling females studied under identical conditions. The absence of ovarian steroid and/or ovarian peptide negative feedback in ovariectomized females may have permitted the synergistic effect of alcohol and LHRH on LH.\r"

Arterial and venous plasma concentrations of NTG in the femoral bed were obtained at 41 and 45 min during each infusion phase. Cardiac output was estimated twice in each animal using 85Sr and 141Ce microspheres. NTG systemic clearance in arterial plasma was found to be strongly correlated with cardiac output (r = 0.784, n = 22, P less than .001). Because NTG distribution between red blood cells and plasma was independent of concentration (up to 150 ng/ml in plasma) and hematocrit (25-48%), the systemic clearance of NTG in arterial blood could be estimated as about 3/4 of cardiac output. Vasopressin co-infusion decreased both the cardiac output and the arterial NTG plasma clearance, but it also increased the arteriovenous extraction of NTG. Thus, vasopressin had not net effect on the venous plasma clearance, of NTG. In animals with NTG infusions alone, cardiac output also significantly correlated with NTG venous plasma clearance (P less than .01) and arteriovenous extraction (P less than .05). These data indicate that, in the absence of vasopressin, NTG pharmacokinetics are dependent on the cardiac output, thus providing an example wherein the systemic clearance of a drug was shown to be related to systemic blood flow. These results support the concept that the vasculature acts as a clearing organ for organic nitrates, and they also provide a hemodynamic explanation for the high variability in NTG plasma concentrations observed under presumed steady-state conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of Mg++ on the effect of diltiazem to increase ligand binding to a high-affinity state of dihydropyridine receptors on voltage-dependent Ca-channels has been studied in chick cardiac and skeletal muscle membranes at 25 degrees C. The high-affinity binding of the Ca-channel inhibitors (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 and [3H]nitrendipine to cardiac membranes was depressed markedly by EDTA and restored fully by the addition of free Mg++ (Ptasienski et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 129: 910-917, 1985). Similar results have now been obtained with skeletal muscle membranes. In the presence of EDTA alone, diltiazem, which binds to another receptor on the Ca-channel, increased the high-affinity binding of both ligands to cardiac and skeletal muscle membranes. However, in the presence of added Mg++, diltiazem had smaller or no effects on the binding of these dihydropyridines. Analyses of the data indicated that both Mg++ and diltiazem could increase the maximum binding (Bmax) for these ligands, but the effect of diltiazem was smaller than, and not additive to, that of Mg++. Specific binding of the Ca-channel activator [3H]Bay k 8644 was only observed in assays containing Mg++ in excess of EDTA. The Bmax for [3H]Bay k 8644 in skeletal muscle membranes was less than that for [3H]PN 200-110 and [3H]nitrendipine, whereas with cardiac membranes equal Bmax values were obtained for all ligands. Diltiazem increased the Bmax for [3H]Bay k 8644 in skeletal muscle, but not in cardiac membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dependence was revealed by antagonist precipitation (Ro 15-1788, CGS-8216) as well as spontaneous emergence of neurobehavioral signs of withdrawal observed by multiple raters blind to treatments. Ro 15-1788 was 45% more effective than CGS-8216 in both reversing chlordiazepoxide intoxication and expressing withdrawal signs. The severity of Ro 15-1788-precipitated withdrawal varied with chlordiazepoxide dose, Ro 15-1788 dose and the agonist-antagonist dose interval. Maximal precipitated dependence was evoked 3 days after chlordiazepoxide HCl (450 mg/kg) by Ro 15-1788 (25 mg/kg i.p.). The precipitated syndrome consisted of tail erection, reduced motor activity, high step, curled claw, arched back, muscle hypertonus and piloerection. Ro 15-1788-precipitated dependence emerged between 28 and 52 hr, peaked at 76 hr and disappeared by 124 hr. Spontaneous withdrawal had emerged from 100 to 124 hr and then faded gradually. The neurobehavioral expression of central nervous system depression and its reversal were necessary but not sufficient conditions for the induction and expression of acute chlordiazepoxide dependence. These results suggest caution in reviving acute benzodiazepine-overdosed patients to avoid iatrogenic withdrawal analogous to naloxone for opiates.\r"

The applicability of these observations to man is uncertain. The dorsal hand vein technique provides an excellent method to examine the direct effects of aging on vascular responsiveness. Thirty-nine healthy male volunteers over the age range of 19 to 79 were studied. No differences in vascular responsiveness to phenylephrine, an alpha adrenergic agonist, were found for either the ED50 (dose producing 50% vasoconstriction) or Emax (maximum vasoconstriction attained). In marked contrast, vascular relaxation induced by isoproterenol, a beta adrenergic agonist, was significantly different in both the ED50 (dose producing 50% of maximum relaxation from a preconstricted state) and Emax (maximum relaxation attained). ED50 +/- S.E.M. for the youngest and oldest deciles were 8.9 +/- 2.3 and 60 +/- 17.0 ng/min, respectively (P less than .05); Emax +/- S.E.M. were 96.7 +/- 3.3 and 37.7 +/- 8.7%, respectively (P less than .001). Nitroglycerin, a smooth muscle relaxant whose effects are not mediated through the cyclic AMP system, was also used to examine the specificity of this blunted response to isoproterenol. Almost complete relaxation was achieved with the infusion of nitroglycerin in the older group. These results suggest that aging is associated with a specific decrease in beta adrenoreceptor-mediated vascular relaxation.\r"

Although this chelating agent promotes increased urinary excretion of Pb and lowers blood Pb concentration, it is a nonspecific metal chelator and it promotes a substantial increase in the urinary loss of the essential metal, Zn. In the work described here, the pattern and extent of changes in blood Pb and plasma Zn and Cu concentrations and of the urinary loss of these metals have been characterized in Pb-poisoned children receiving 5-day courses of 1000 mg of Ca disodium EDTA per m2 of surface area per day, given i.m. Both blood Pb and plasma Zn concentrations were reduced rapidly during treatment; plasma Cu concentration was unaffected. At 60 hr after the cessation of Ca disodium EDTA treatment, plasma Zn concentration rebounded rapidly to its pretreatment value but blood Pb concentration remained at about 60% of its pretreatment value. Treatment with Ca disodium EDTA produced an approximate 21-fold increase in the daily rate of urinary loss of Pb and about a 17-fold increase in the daily rate of Zn loss in urine. There was no increase in urinary loss of Cu above the endogenous level. The chelatable body burden of Pb was estimated by two related methods. Statistically significant correlations were found between chelatable Pb burdens estimated by either method and blood Pb concentrations before Ca disodium EDTA treatment. In contrast, no correlation was found between plasma Zn concentration and the urinary loss of Zn during chelation therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The changes in coronary resistance and left ventricular pulse pressure induced by PMA-stimulated neutrophils were attenuated by scavengers of superoxide anion (superoxide dismutase), hydrogen peroxide (catalase) and hydroxyl radical (dimethylthiourea), thereby implying a pivotal role for hydroxyl radical. Inasmuch as the increase in coronary resistance could be reversed partially by the nonspecific vasodilator, sodium nitroprusside, and inasmuch as none of the free radical scavengers influenced PMA-induced neutrophil aggregation, the increase in coronary resistance evoked by PMA-stimulated neutrophils is related in part to oxygen radical-mediated coronary vasoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "Blood vessel responses to relaxant drugs have been reported to change with aging and with the development of hypertension. In view of the requirement of endothelial cells for the activity of many relaxant drugs, we examined the role of the endothelium in the relaxation response of vascular tissue. Aortic and mesenteric ring segments from normotensive and hypertensive rats, ages 5 to 6, 15 to 18 and 30 to 31 weeks, were examined for relaxation to sodium nitroprusside, sodium nitrite, atrial natriuretic factor and 8-bromo-cyclic GMP. Relaxation responses to the nitrovasodilators were reduced progressively with aging in ring segments of Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with intact endothelium; however, intact SHR ring preparations displayed less relaxation to nitrovasodilators at 15 to 18 and 30 to 31 weeks than those of WKYs. Rubbed (endothelium denuded) ring preparations displayed greatest relaxation to nitrovasodilators with no difference being observed between SHR and WKY preparations at any age tested. Relaxation to atrial natriuretic factor and 8-bromo-cyclic GMP was not different between rubbed and unrubbed ring segments or between SHRs and WKYs, indicating no detectable impairment of the overall relaxation response in the vascular smooth muscle of SHRs. These results suggest that the total functional capacity of vascular smooth muscle to relax to nitrovasodilators is not changed with aging or hypertension. However, the endothelial cells exert modulatory influences upon the vascular smooth muscle to reduce overall responsiveness to nitrovasodilators, an effect that is enhanced with aging and the development of genetic hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of various receptor agonists and elevated extracellular potassium to initiate inositol phospholipid hydrolysis in various regions of rat brain was examined by using a direct assay which involves prelabeling slices with [3H]inositol and assaying [3H]inositol phosphates ([3H]IPs) in the presence of lithium. Both carbachol and noradrenaline evoked an increase in [3H]IP accumulation in all cerebral regions, although there were marked topographical differences in maximal responsiveness. These marked differences do not seem to be due to regional differences in coupling as similar apparent affinities of full agonists and the relative intrinsic activities of partial agonists were obtained. Both carbachol and noradrenaline responses were antagonized equipotently in all the brain regions tested by the muscarinic and alpha-1 antagonists atropine and prazosin, respectively. However, the putatively selective muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine did show an (approximately 10-fold) apparent selectivity against the carbachol responses elicited in the forebrain regions from those in the pons-medulla. Evaluation of extracellular potassium to 18 mM resulted in an increased production of [3H]IPs in all brain regions except the cerebellum. Incubation of slices with the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (50 microM) and the dihydropyridine Ca++ channel activator BAY-K-8644 (1 microM) greatly enhanced the responses produced by elevated K+ in the forebrain regions but had markedly weaker effects in the hindbrain regions. The elevated K+ response alone and the enhanced response in the presence of BAY-K-8644 were both antagonized significantly by the dihydropyridine antagonist (+)-PN-205-033 in all brain regions, by 70 to 80 and 70 to 95%, respectively.\r"

Seventy-one burned guinea pigs (30% TBSA) with previously placed catheter gastrostomies were divided into six groups. The first, second, and third groups received 10%, 20%, and 30%, respectively, of total calories as whey protein. The other three groups received BCAA supplementation to increase BCAA to 50% of total amino acids, compared to 21.5% BCAA content in whey protein. Groups I and IV received isonitrogenous intake, as did groups II and V, and III and VI, respectively. After an initial 3-day adaptation period, all animals in all groups received continuous isocaloric (175 kcal/kg/day) intragastric tube feeding until postburn day (PBD) 14. At PBD 14, although BCAA-supplemented groups showed very high plasma levels of BCAA (IV: 169%; V: 306%; VI: 770% of normal), no BCAA group showed evidence of any beneficial effect in various nutritional parameters when compared with the corresponding whey protein group with isonitrogenous intake. Cumulative nitrogen balance and mortality during 14 days were significantly worse in BCAA groups IV and VI than in control groups I and III, respectively. It is concluded that BCAA supplementation to enteral diets has no beneficial effect for postburn nutritional management following severe burn injury. It is further suggested that when nitrogen intake is too low or very high, BCAA supplementation may have an adverse effect.\r"

We controlled for the hospital in which care was given and the DRG to which the discharge was assigned. The largest effects were that average charges were 6.7% higher for beneficiaries who were disabled before the age of 65 years, and 6.2% higher for patients admitted from a nursing home; charges were 1.5% lower for Medicare beneficiaries who were also enrolled in Medicaid, 3.8% higher for those older than 80 years, and 1.3% lower for those older than 85 years compared with those aged from 80 to 84 years. Because these differences are very small compared with the average variation within DRGs, we conclude that using these beneficiary characteristics in the DRG classification system would only slightly improve DRGs. Medicare's DRG-based payments seem to be substantially equitable with regard to these beneficiary characteristics.\r"

Our results show that 153 deaths per 10 000 patients occur when no prophylaxis is used; with most prophylaxis, this number is at least halved, and the most effective methods may reduce the number of deaths by three fourths. In addition, all of the prophylaxis considered are cost saving: average costs of care (including prophylaxis costs) are reduced by +19.40 to +181.60 per patient. Prophylaxis against deep-vein thrombosis in major orthopedic surgery therefore saves both lives and health care dollars.\r"

In phase I, 57 boys aged 10 to 17 years were categorized into four pubertal stages based on clinical parameters and plasma testosterone levels. These four groups showed increasing plasma testosterone values and decreasing HDL-C levels. In phase II, 14 boys with delayed adolescence were treated with testosterone enanthate (100, 200, and 200 mg/mo, respectively, for three months). Plasma testosterone levels during therapy were in the adult male range. Levels of HDL-C decreased by a mean of 7.4 mg/dL (0.20 mmol/L) and 13.7 mg/dL (0.35 mmol/L), respectively, after the first two doses. In phase III, 13 boys with delayed adolescence demonstrated increasing plasma testosterone levels and decreasing HDL-C levels (-12.0 mg/dL [-0.30 mmol/L]) during spontaneous puberty. Levels of HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1 were correlated during induced and spontaneous puberty. Testosterone should be considered a significant determinant (not necessarily directly causal) of plasma HDL-C levels during pubertal development.\r"

This report focuses on ten of the 23 patients who experienced return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during monitoring. There was no significant difference in the end-tidal CO2 value of patients without ROSC (1.8% +/- 0.9%) and the end-tidal CO2 value of patients before ROSC in patients who had ROSC (1.7% +/- 0.6%). The end-tidal CO2 concentration increased immediately in all patients who had ROSC, from 1.7% +/- 0.6% to 4.6% +/- 1.4%, then gradually returned to a new baseline (3.1% +/- 0.9%). Change in the end-tidal CO2 value was often the first clinical indicator that ROSC had occurred. Our findings suggest that end-tidal CO2 monitoring may provide clinically useful information that can be used to guide therapy during CPR.\r"

Selenium metabolism and techniques for assessing selenium status also received attention at the workshop. A measurement of blood selenium levels was accepted, in general, as a valid technique for assessing selenium status in individuals with relatively constant selenium intakes. Clinical practitioners at the workshop reported that some of their total parenteral nutrition patients not receiving selenium presented biochemical evidence of selenium deficiency, but no characteristic clinical syndrome due to selenium deficiency has yet been observed in such patients. The workshop attendees acknowledged the need for an official guideline for selenium use in total parenteral nutrition, but were unable to develop a consensus regarding such a guideline. However, the workshop agreed that any guideline established in the future should specify the type of patients to be supplemented, the dose of selenium to be administered, and the selenium compound to be used. Until that time, the physician supervising the therapy must assume responsibility both for determining the need for selenium supplementation, and for the administration of the supplemental selenium.\r"

There was no difference in the wound-healing response between the two latter groups of patients who had significantly different degrees of malnutrition. The results suggest that a definite abnormality in the wound-healing response exists in malnourished surgical patients, but it occurs earlier in the course of the illness than previously supposed.\r"

Patients were studied through 35 days posttransplant. Muscle protein status and turnover was assessed by weekly nitrogen balance, and creatinine and 3-methylhistidine excretion. Results favored a muscle protein-sparing effect of exercise, as a significant decrease in creatinine excretion in controls only suggested muscle protein loss associated with inactivity.

After 8 weeks, calluses were x-rayed and the tibia was removed, fixed in a special block of methyl-metacrylate, and tested at tension up to failure in a mechanical testing apparatus. The distraction force at failure was measured, and callus stiffness and energy absorbed to failure were calculated. The low protein diet resulted in significantly lower tensile strength and stiffness of calluses compared to the other three dietary regimens, this despite adequate caloric intake. In addition, the low protein diet resulted in a callus with \"rubbery\" mechanical properties compared to the \"rigid\" calluses of the other three groups. The high protein diet did not result in any significant improvement in fracture healing. These results gain clinical significance in the face of a high incidence of protein calorie malnutrition in injured orthopedic surgery patients.\r"

After a mean of 4.1 months of treatment, all patients had a marked improvement in nutritional status and resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms; 90% reduced their corticosteroid dose. Eight of nine patients had endoscopic and/or radiographic evidence of mucosal healing. Although 60% of patients were able to avoid surgery and tolerate refeeding, all six patients continue to require steroids to control symptoms. Our study suggests that HPN and bowel rest is a useful therapeutic approach to selected patients with active Crohn's disease, which permits a reduction in corticosteroid dosage and partial healing of mucosal lesions in most. Further studies are required to determine which patients should receive HPN and its optimal duration.\r"

The effects of a high supply of BCAA in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on nitrogen balance and liver protein synthesis were studied in a postoperative rat model. After standard operative trauma TPN was commenced with one of two isocaloric programs (I: 20.1% BCAA and II: 50% BCAA) and continued for 48 hr. The relative rate of liver protein synthesis, measured after TPN in vitro by perfusion with 14C-leucine, was similar in both groups (I: 53.4 +/- 17.3 and II: 49.0 +/- 27.3 arbitrary units of synthesis rate, mean +/- SD). The cumulative nitrogen balance was positive with both regimens and was not improved by the high supply of BCAA (I: 2.02 +/- 0.81 and II: 1.87 +/- 0.63 gN/kg/48 hr mean +/- SD). We conclude that after moderate surgical trauma TPN with a high supply of BCAA offers no advantage over conventional TPN.\r"

The analyses were performed on muscle biopsy specimens taken prior to surgery and on days 1 and 3 following surgery. The percentage content of polyribosomes, total ribosome concentration and the polyribosome concentrations per milligram of tissue DNA were determined. Elective abdominal surgery caused a significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in the three variables. Total parenteral nutrition did not prevent the decrease. The negative nitrogen balance was significantly improved by total parenteral nutrition, but it did not reach equilibrium. The results show that total parenteral nutrition given postoperatively did not maintain protein synthesis activity in skeletal muscle. The improvement in nitrogen balance suggests that amino acids are utilized by tissues other than skeletal muscle.\r"

Aluminum was measured in 136 samples from various commercially available components that are used with PN. Results showed Al content varied widely among different components. The same chemical may have a different Al content depending on the manufacturer. However, Al contents were similar among lots from the same manufacturer for the same chemical. Aluminum contamination was arbitrarily classified as high (greater than 500 micrograms Al/liter), intermediate (51-500 micrograms Al/liter) or low (less than or equal to 50 micrograms Al/liter). The high group included most calcium and phosphorus containing salts, 1 multivitamin preparation, folic acid, ascorbic acid and concentrated (25%) albumin. The intermediate group included sodium lactate, potassium phosphates, zinc and chromium chloride, multitrace metal preparation, and 5% plasma protein. The low group included amino acids, sterile water and dextrose water, chloride salts of sodium, potassium, calcium, copper and chromium, sodium phosphates, magnesium sulphate, zinc sulphate, vitamin B12, vitamin K1, 1 multivitamin preparation, soybean oil emulsion and heparinized (2 U/ml) saline. PN solutions made from high Al components may contain up to 300 micrograms Al/liter. Calcium gluconate contributed greater than 80% of the total Al load from PN. Lowering of Al content in calcium gluconate in addition to use of specific low Al components offers the opportunity to significantly lower the Al concentration of the final PN solution and theoretically may achieve an Al content as low as 12 micrograms/l.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The total phospholipid (PHL) contents of lung tissue were similar in both groups. However, we found differences in the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine fraction (DPPC--the most important component of surfactant material) in both lung tissue and lavage fluid. With lipid emulsion, there was an increased fraction of saturated lecithins (mainly DPPC) both in lung tissue and lavage fluid, similar to former studies with hypocaloric alimentation. In this model, those findings suggest that the PHL pattern does not depend on the quantity of caloric supply, but, rather, on the infusion composition. The enhanced DPPC content is further reflected in improved surfactant status: lipid in parenteral nutrition (PN) may exert a direct salutary effect on lung mechanics.\r"

Three patients received fat-free TPN, and one patient was tube fed 1000 ml/day of Intralipid 10% enterally. Fat-free TPN lowered plasma lipid, especially low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL). On the other hand, intravenous administration of Intralipid 10% caused a marked increase of LDL, together with increases of phospholipid and cholesterol, especially free cholesterol. Triglyceride, VLDL, and HDL remained within the normal range in this group. Enteral administration of the same amount of Intralipid 10% did not cause a rise of LDL. Lipid composition of the increased LDL approximated that of lipoprotein X with the intravenous Intralipid 10%. From these findings, we suggest that phospholipids in Intralipid 10% formed abnormal LDL as the result of mobilization of cholesterol from extravascular tissues, when administered intravenously.\r"

Consequently, we investigated the fat tolerance in six low-birth-weight infants with sepsis and 15 low-birth-weight infants without sepsis. For measurement of fat clearance, we assayed the serum concentrations of triglycerides enzymatically, and of the free fatty acids by colorimetric micromethod. The fatty acid oxidation was analyzed with the [13C]triolein breath test by means of ratio-mass spectrometry. The infants were maintained on continuous parenteral nutrition with various amounts of soybean oil emulsion (1 g, 2 g, and 3 g fat/kg body weight per day). Comparing the lipid infusion of 1 and 2 g fat/kg body weight per day between the two groups, we found triglyceride and free fatty acid values in both groups to be in the normal range. At a dose of 3 g of fat/kg body weight per day, septic low-birth-weight infants showed a significantly higher concentration of triglycerides (2.02 +/- 0.46 mmol/liter) and of free fatty acids (2.06 +/- 0.45 mmol/liter) than the nonseptic low-birth-weight infants (triglycerides: 1.09 +/- 0.43 mmol/liter; free fatty acids: 1.05 +/- 0.41 mmol/liter). The low-birth-weight infants with sepsis showed a reduced fat oxidation rate of 16.0 +/- 1.5% in contrast to that of the low-birth-weight infants without sepsis, whose rate was 38.4 +/- 1.8%. Accordingly, we apply dosages not exceeding 2 g of fat/kg body weight per day to septic low-birth-weight infants.\r"

Four hundred seventy-three CVCs were placed for PN for a total of 5,422 patient days, with a mean length of stay of 11.5 days. Twenty two CVCs led to sepsis for an IR of 4.65% or 4.06 infections per 1000 patient days. Twenty of the 22 septic CVCs were in patients with other sites of infection. The IR was 12.0% (20/166) when other sites of infection were present and 0.65% (2/307) in the absence of a second site. The mean length of stay was 13.2 days for CVCs with other sites of infection and 10.3 days for CVCs with no other site of infection. Fifty nine percent of septic CVCs had secondary sites of infection that included urinary tract infections (UTI). Of all septic CVCs, 22.7% had no site of infection other than UTI. The presence of UTI appears to present a high risk of CVC sepsis. Appropriate identification and treatment of UTI prior to CVC insertion is recommended.\r"

Six hundred twenty-two catheters were placed in 377 patients for a total of 9,200 patient days. The length of CVC stay ranged from 2 to 108 days with a mean of 14.5. CVC longevity was longer on units where certification of nurses by the PEN team was mandatory (mean 20.4 days, IR 3.5%) vs comparable units which utilized informal instruction (mean 14.4 days, IR 3.5%). Twenty-two catheters led to patient sepsis for a rate of 3.5%, or 2.39 CVC-related infections per 1000 patient days. The preteam infection rate was 24.0%, as determined by a 6-month prospective study. Infection rates for CVCs used for TPN only and those used for parenteral nutrition (PN) plus blood products, antibiotics, and CVP measurements were identical, 3.5%. The team approach can effectively increase PN catheter longevity and reduce infection rates. Conservative cost accounting of best and worst case scenarios determined a range of $3,700 to $8,900 per episode of catheter sepsis.\r"

However, these advantages as outlined in this review, must be carefully weighed against potential disadvantages before the TNA system is employed as a nutritional support modality. It should also be noted that the stability of TNA systems is not well established since many stability studies do not provide specific information regarding formulations tested. In addition, many studies do not utilize methods to determine the entire spectrum of particle size and distribution. Droplet size in TNA systems attain a diameter several times larger than the 0.2 to 0.4 micron of manufacturer's lipid emulsions and naturally occurring chylomicrons. Although the administration of the TNA system has not been associated with any acute toxicity, the long-term consequences of infusing droplets larger than 0.4 micron is not definitely known. In addition, the biological implications of using the TNA system need to be elucidated. Subtle differences in the properties of the lipid emulsion can affect the way it is metabolized by the body. Wretlind has mentioned that two apparently similar soybean oil emulsions, Intralipid, and Lipofundin are handled differently by the body. Minor differences in the phospholipid layer of the droplets were postulated as a cause. Certainly the nature of the emulsifying layer of phospholipid on TNA system droplets is modified and therefore may be metabolized differently. The recent report of enhanced growth of microorganisms in TNA systems is also worrisome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At age 8 yr, 8 months, the serum Cr level was elevated: 3.7 ng/ml (normal 0.03-0.85). A repeat level at the same time by another commercial laboratory was also high (7.0). Cr supplementation was stopped. At age 10 yr, he was noted to have mild peripheral neuropathy although glucose tolerance was excellent (alpha-linolenic acid was undetectable in the plasma). Cr status was reevaluated in a research lab. The serum level was 1.4 ng/ml (normal 0.05-0.4). The urine chromium excretion was 1.27 micrograms/day (normal 0.22). The TPN regimen (unsupplemented with Cr) provided 4 micrograms/day. Normal Cr intake is about 60 micrograms/day with 0.4% absorption (net 0.24 microgram/day). We conclude that Cr contamination of standard PN fluid may prevent biochemical evidence of low Cr status.

  ".W": "A 27-yr-old gravida 3, para 2 was supported from the 8th week of pregnancy by intermittent daily total parenteral nutrition (TPN) following the loss of her small bowel. Nutrient intake was adjusted by monitoring nitrogen balance and the rate of increase in fetal cranial enlargement. Maternal calcium balance proved difficult to maintain, since massive urinary Ca+2 losses occurred during infusion of nutrients (576 +/- 2 mg/12 hr on TPN compared to 47 +/- 12 mg/12 hr off). This increase in urine Ca+2 was due to depressed Ca+2 reabsorption by the kidney (87.1 +/- .7 vs 98.1 +/- .3%) and increased filtered load (4623 +/- 241 mg/12 hr vs 2591 +/- 329). Initially calcium balance was -180 mg/day. Nitrogen balance assessed by total stool and urine nitrogen was 1.1 g/24 hr, which was judged to be suboptimal. Deficits were corrected by increasing nitrogen intake, lengthening the duration of infusion and the oral administration of elemental calcium during periods off infusion. A normal fetus was delivered vaginally without complications at 351/2 weeks. This patient demonstrates that normal fetal growth and development as well as appropriate maternal weight gain and nitrogen balance can be maintained throughout pregnancy, including the first trimester, by intermittent daily TPN.\r"

  ".W": "A simple rabbit care unit for peripheral intravenous feeding and metabolic studies was developed. The unit consists of six aluminum boxes with a common cover. Inverted T-shaped mobile supports hanging from the upper horizontal part of a frame hold the infusion lines. The side walls of the box prevent the rabbit from turning around, but other movements are possible. After initial training with 21 surgically treated animals, there was only one early anesthetic death among the subsequent 21 rabbits (4.8%). There was one late death (4.8%), and one animal was slightly, and two animals clearly, deteriorated. The ear vein cannula had to be changed in one-third of the animals not more than 3 days from the outset. Problems associated with the infusion systems or urinary bladder catheterization were minor. The results showed that it is practical to infuse rabbits via a peripheral intravenous route in a semi-restraining metabolic unit. The cases of late death and deterioration can be explained in part by the stress of experimental conditions with starvation and surgery, rather than by the effect of the metabolic unit alone. With previous experience in treating rabbits, we find the period required to learn this technique is short.\r"

The mammary carcinoma cell lines were all sensitive to Hu-IFN-gamma, and 2 of them (ZR-75.1 and 734-B) were also affected by RA. The combination of both substances led to a pronounced synergistic amplification of growth inhibition in ZR-75.1 and 734-B cells. RA also increased the antiproliferative activity of Hu-IFN-gamma in the RA-resistant BT-20 cells and to a less pronounced degree in MCF-7 cells. In contrast to these findings, no synergistic effects were observed between Hu-IFN-gamma and RA in CCL-185 and HEP-2 cells. Human recombinant DNA-derived interferon-alpha 2 amplified the action of RA only in BT-20 cells, but it did not act synergistically with RA in the other cell lines tested.\r"

High numbers of anaphase aberrations in embryos exposed to MM were associated with low mitotic indices, cell pyknosis, and high embryo mortalities. When the anaphase aberration data for embryos exposed to AFB1 were compared to previously reported carcinogenesis data from the microinjection assay, the incidence of anaphase aberrations in embryos did not show the same quantitative variations as the incidence of hepatic carcinomas in adult trout. While anaphase aberrations may be an indicator of the clastogenic effects of chemicals on fish embryos, it is unlikely that these aberrations can be used as an early indicator of a carcinogenic response in the trout embryo assay.\r"

Each agent was given individually in one of two doses as follows: DFMO, 0.05% and 0.1% in the drinking water; piroxicam, 65 mg/kg diet and 130 mg/kg diet; and menhaden fish oil, 1.25% and 2.50% of the diet. Additional animal groups were given combinations of the lower dose of DFMO and the lower dose of either piroxicam or fish oil. Intestinal tumors were induced by sc injections of azoxymethane (AOM; CAS: 25843-45-2) at 8 mg/kg (body wt) weekly for 8 weeks. Test diets were started 1 week prior to the first dose of AOM, and the rats were sacrificed 26 weeks later. Rats that received either dose of DFMO or the high dose of piroxicam developed significantly fewer intestinal tumors compared to controls. The low dose of piroxicam and the fish oil given at either dose level had no effect. The combination of the low dose of DFMO and the low dose of piroxicam reduced tumor formation more than either dose of DFMO alone, whereas the low dose of DFMO and fish oil together was no more effective than either dose of DFMO alone. These results show that a combination of a small amount of DFMO and piroxicam, each acting through a different mechanism, exerts an additive inhibitory effect on intestinal tumor formation in rats.\r"

The small amounts of LPS alone were insufficient to activate the macrophages for TNF production. Priming by r-IFN-gamma was not necessary when larger amounts of LPS were employed, although an enhancement of yield resulted. Priming could also be demonstrated in vivo. Inoculation of r-IFN-gamma into mice resulted in increased yields of TNF following LPS challenge 12 hours later.\r"

Chemical carcinogens and UV light were applied to the ears of 10 mice of each sex and genotype for each group. Treatments were: 0.5 mg 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene [(DMBA) CAS: 57-97-6] to each ear; 0.125 mg DMBA to each ear, followed by 0.1 microgram 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate [(TPA) CAS: 16561-29-8] twice weekly for 56 weeks; 0.2 mg N-nitroso-N-methylurea [(NMU) CAS: 684-93-5; 1% in acetone, 20 microliter] to each ear; 0.1 mg NMU to each ear weekly for 30 weeks; 0.2 mg NMU to each ear, followed by TPA twice weekly for 56 weeks; two ip doses of N-nitroso-N-ethylurea [(NEU) CAS: 759-73-9; 25 mg/kg each], followed by TPA twice weekly topically for 56 weeks; and exposure to sunlamps (250- to 400-nm emission) two or three times per week for 20 weeks, for a total dose of 3.7 X 10(5) J/m2. The chemical treatments caused mainly squamous papillomas and carcinomas, sebaceous adenomas and adenocarcinomas, and basal cell tumors, which appeared both on the skin of the ears and elsewhere. UV light caused squamous tumors, basal cell tumors, and sarcomas. Ear skin of the nu/nu mice developed significantly more squamous tumors than those of nu/+ mice after DMBA-TPA, NMU-TPA, NEU-TPA, repeated NMU, or UV light. Similar results were obtained for the skin of the heads and bodies. Even a single dose of NMU caused a few tumors on the nude, but not the euthymic, mice. A single dose of DMBA caused primarily sebaceous adenomas, distributed at random over the entire bodies. These results show that, contrary to previous reports, nude mice are sensitive to skin tumorigenesis, more so than euthymic nu/+ mice similarly exposed to diverse types of carcinogen and treatment protocols.\r"

  ".W": "The possible role of antibody and T-lymphocytes was investigated in the pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with feline leukemia virus, subgroup C (FeLV-C), infection. In previous studies, erythroid colony-forming cells were undetectable in marrow culture of cats with PRCA. Yet erythroid burst-forming cells (BFU-E) remained, suggesting that BFU-E were able to differentiate in vitro but not in vivo. It was inferred that immunologic suppression may contribute to the pathogenesis of feline PRCA, and the interactions of antibody and T-lymphocytes with erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors were studied. Incubation of normal or PRCA marrow cells with PRCA serum or IgG concentrated from this serum and then complement (C') failed to decrease hematopoietic colony growth when compared to the results obtained with cultures of marrow cells incubated with C' alone. In crossover coculture studies, T-cells from Safari cats with PRCA had no inhibitory effect on colony growth from normal or autologous PRCA marrow cells. For the determination of whether feline PRCAs were associated with a clonal T-cell process, lymphocytes were obtained periodically from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glc-6-PD) heterozygous cats following FeLV-C infection and were expanded with a crude preparation of interleukin-2. The ratios of Glc-6-PD enzyme types in these samples did not change as cats developed anemia, suggesting that the inhibition of erythropoiesis was not associated with the clonal expansion of T-cells. These studies, therefore, do not support the premise that feline PRCA results from the interaction of antibody or T-cells with erythroid progenitors.\r"

With a less potent carcinogen (0.1% DMBA), vitamin E was shown to prevent tumor development. Eighty (total) male and female Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were divided into 4 equal groups. After 28 weeks, animals in group 2 that had left buccal pouches painted with 0.1% DMBA (in heavy mineral oil) three times/week and that had been given 10 mg DL-alpha-tocopherol on alternate days (i.e., two times/wk) showed no tumors there. However, the pouches of group 1 animals that had been similarly painted with DMBA but that had received no vitamin E demonstrated grossly and microscopically the presence of epidermoid carcinomas.\r"

Plasma alcohol concentration rose to 16.7 mM within 70 min of commencement of drinking. There was no change in uptake of 86rubidium or sodium after 60 min in either the alcohol or control studies. There was a late increase in plasma sodium levels 90 min after alcohol ingestion, attributed to fluid volume contraction following diuresis. In contrast, plasma potassium levels fell after alcohol ingestion. This was associated with a decrease in urinary potassium excretion, hence ascribed to an intracellular shift of potassium ions, a change inconsistent with NA+,K+-ATPase inhibition. It is concluded that acute moderate doses of alcohol do not influence NA+,K+-ATPase activity or passive sodium uptake in circulating erythrocytes. Unless vascular smooth muscle is more sensitive to the effects of alcohol in vitro, these findings make it less likely that inhibition of NA+,K+-ATPase mediates alcohol-related hypertension in man.\r"

Peak rIL2-induced proliferation was significantly decreased (mean reduction of 58%) in 5 of the 10 patients with SLE. Five of six patients with SLE studied for phytohemagglutinin-induced IL2 receptors had acquisition of IL2 receptors comparable to that of the control subjects. Some patients with SLE have a defect in rIL2-induced proliferation of their \"resting\" PBM that seems unrelated to a concomitant defect in phytohemagglutinin-induced IL2 receptor acquisition. This finding suggests that the defect in rIL2-induced proliferation may be due to either an abnormality in postreceptor signaling or an impairment in induction of high-affinity IL2 receptors.\r"

In 12 of the children the height velocity rose on GHRH treatment, and 8 were judged to have shown a worthwhile response to therapy in that their height velocities during the first 6 months of treatment increased by greater than 2 cm/yr (range 2.7-11.2 cm/yr). These 8 children have now been treated for 6 to 18 months and their increase in height velocity has been maintained. In the 14 patients who had previously received human GH (hGH) height velocity on hGH correlated with that on GHRH. 4 of these patients showed growth deceleration with GHRH, for unknown reasons. A pretreatment peak serum GH response of above 30 mU/l during an intravenous GHRH test was predictive of a good growth response to GHRH but a lower peak did not preclude a growth response. There was no consistent evidence of a priming or desensitisation effect of therapy on the GH responses to GHRH. Although anti-GHRH antibodies developed in 14 patients, these did not seem to have adverse effects on either growth or the GH responses to GHRH. GHRH (1-29) NH2 therapy is an alternative to conventional hGH in the treatment of some GH-deficient children. Ideal dose regimens need to be established.\r"

We speculated that this effect may be mediated by a long-term depression of prolactin secretion after pregnancy. We therefore measured basal and post-stimulation serum levels of prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in two groups--15 women 18 to 23 years of age and 9 women 29 to 40--before and after a first full-term pregnancy, and in 40 appropriate nulliparous controls. We observed no significant change in basal levels of serum LH or FSH or in the levels stimulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone in any group. A significant decrease was seen, however, in basal and perphenazine-stimulated levels of prolactin after pregnancy in both the younger and older first-pregnancy groups but not in the controls. In a separate cross-sectional study, we compared basal serum prolactin levels in 29 parous and 19 nulliparous women of similar age. The serum prolactin levels were significantly lower in the parous group but were not related to the number of pregnancies (one to three) or the time elapsed (12 to 150 months) since the last delivery. We conclude that a first pregnancy leads to a long-term decrease in serum prolactin secretion, lasting at least 12 to 13 years.\r"

  ".W": "Class II molecules encoded by the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are involved in regulating T-cell response to antigens. The mechanisms for generating polymorphism in products of the MHC have been studied extensively for both the murine H-2 and the human HLA complex. Such studies indicate that point mutations plus selection have a major role in the generation of polymorphisms of class I and class II MHC genes. However, a non-reciprocal gene conversion mechanism has been proposed to explain several examples of clustered sequence variation in MHC genes. In all these examples, the proposed gene conversion event is unidirectional; that is, one of the two interacting genes acts as sequence donor and the other as sequence recipient. No examples of potential reciprocal genetic exchange (as occurs in the fungal system), in which the two interacting genes act as both donor and recipient of gene fragments, have been found in the MHC system or in other multigene families of higher organisms. We sequenced two different HLA-DR beta complementary DNAs from each of two different cells all expressing the same serologically defined determinant (DR2) but different T-cell-recognized (Dw) specificities (Dw12 and MN2). Sequence comparisons of these four cDNA clones (and two DR beta amino-acid sequences from the DR2-Dw2 subtype) suggest that new coding sequences for DR beta molecules in the DR2 haplotypes are potentially generated by reciprocal intergenic exchange.\r"

Here, using digitized low-light video microscopy, we examine blebbing, cytosolic free Ca2+, mitochondrial membrane potential and loss of cell viability in individual cultured hepatocytes. Unexpectedly, we found that after 'chemical hypoxia' with cyanide and iodoacetate, cytosolic free Ca2+ does not change during bleb formation or before loss of cellular viability. Cell death was precipitated by a sudden breakdown of the plasma membrane permeability barrier, possibly caused by rupture of a cell surface bleb.\r"

While the antibodies to the 52,000- and 70,000-dalton proteins were more common in ALS than control sera (p less than 0.02 and less than 0.05, respectively), it is not clear from this initial study that this difference is of clinical or etiologic significance.\r"

Median survival was six or seven months in each trial. Twenty-five percent of the patients survived nine months with cisplatin and 14 to 16 months with each of the three combinations. Characteristics associated with best rate of response included: performance status 1 (completely ambulatory), age greater than or equal to 50, residual tumor less than or equal to 5 cm, and two or less prior cytotoxic drugs. In multivariate analyses, performance status dominated, although age and possibly treatment (cisplatin versus others) were significant. With performance status removed from the model, all of the remaining factors became significant. Factors associated with best survival included: performance status 1, tumor size less than or equal to 5 cm, and complete or partial response. In a multivariate analysis for survival, performance status entered the model. In a series of analyses with performance status removed, tumor size or response entered the model. These findings provide reasons to study both treatment with cisplatin before disease progression reduces the number of favorable characteristics and systematic second attempts at debulking surgery.\r"

The absence of PRL secretory response to dopamine or TRH in prolactinoma patients also may be an effect of the disease. Twenty-six women diagnosed by dynamic tests and radiologic examination as having PRL-secreting adenoma were treated surgically (15) or with bromocriptine (11) and their condition was evaluated one to three years later by TRH, nomifensine, and domperidone tests. Basal PRL levels decreased after surgery and bromocriptine treatment. At the time of the follow-up study, PRL levels were elevated in six of the 15 surgically treated patients and in six of the 11 treated with bromocriptine. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone, nomifensine, and domperidone produced standard PRL responses in normoprolactinemic patients but not in hyperprolactinemic patients. These results indicate that the alteration of TRH or dopaminergic receptors in the regulation of PRL secretion in prolactinoma is related to the disease and disappears when the tumor is removed or treated successfully with bromocriptine.\r"

Conclusions are as follows: The periosteum is destroyed and, in general, the external surface of the cortical bone is resorbed through osteoclastic action. However, the periosteum at times resists the invasion of tumors. As the cortical bone is resorbed to some extent and tumor replaces the resorbed area, Volkmann and haversian canals begin to enlarge. Following enlargement of the canals, tumor invasion results in enlargement of the canals of the cortical bone far from the invaded area. In addition, tumors invade the periodontal space and resorb the inner surface of the alveolar bone. Tumors invade the bone marrow through the enlarged haversian canals or the periodontal space or by direct resorption of cortical bone, thus replacing the marrow spaces.\r"

Holotransducin is poorly phosphorylated by the insulin receptor kinase and is not phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Neither holotransducin nor any of its subunits were phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. That a given subunit of transducin undergoes multisite phosphorylation depending on the type of nucleotide bound to it or the nature of the kinase suggests that hormone-dependent phosphorylation could provide a versatile mode for regulation of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) function. In particular, the findings that certain G proteins serve as substrates for both the insulin receptor kinase and protein kinase C implicate G proteins in playing a key role in mediating the action of insulin and ligands that act to activate protein kinase C.\r"

The molecular masses of the four proteins vary from 40 kDa to 105 kDa, and the structural resemblance appears to be constrained to a single segment of each protein. These related segments are proposed to comprise the catalytic domains in this set of enzymes. The lack of absolute sequence identity between the two bovine enzymes shows that they are unique gene products that are not produced by alternative processing of a larger protein or of a single mRNA precursor. The data also strongly support the conclusion that the dunce+ gene locus of Drosophila and the PDE2 gene locus in yeast code for structural genes of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases.\r"

The presence of transforming DNA sequences was detected by formation of anchorage-independent foci after transfection of tumor-derived DNA in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Transfection of genomic DNA isolated from individual tumors from eight animals resulted in specific transforming activities ranging from 0.05 to 0.2 foci per micrograms of DNA. Primary transfectant DNAs were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with DNA probes homologous to c-Ha-ras, c-Ki-ras, and N-ras oncogenes. A highly amplified c-Ki-ras oncogene of rat origin was detected in transformants derived from tumors in two of the eight animals tested. There was no evidence to suggest the presence of c-Ha-ras or N-ras sequences in any of the transformants. Analysis of primary liver tumor DNA showed no Ki-ras DNA amplification when compared to control liver DNA samples. Increased levels of c-Ki-ras p21 proteins were detected in 3T3 transformants containing activated rat c-Ki-ras genes. The presence of c-Ki-ras sequences of rat origin capable of inducing transformed foci can be taken as evidence that the c-Ki-ras gene has been activated in the primary liver tumors.\r"

We have reported the sequence of the Eip28/29 gene and of its major transcript. Here we describe a minor or short-form transcript that is about 25% of the total Eip28/29 gene transcripts in both untreated and hormone-treated cells. This transcript is formed by the use of an alternative splice donor sequence 12 nucleotides upstream from the major donor site at the end of the second exon. Evidently the relative abundance of the two products is not hormonally regulated. The short form translation product should lack only an internal dibasic tetrapeptide. The long and short forms probably represent distinct mRNAs for EIP 28III and EIP 29III, respectively.\r"

RNA blots demonstrate that CAIII messages can be detected in a variety of cell types but that high-level expression is limited to human fetal and adult skeletal muscle and to rodent slow skeletal muscle and liver. In addition, we have used a panel of human-mouse cell hybrids to localize the human CAIII gene to chromosome 8. Previous reports have established the CAI and CAII isozyme genes to be closely linked on chromosome 8, and the assignment of the CAIII gene to the same chromosome raises the possibility that these genes may all be linked at a single complex locus.\r"

S1-nuclease mapping experiments demonstrated that IgH gene expression was extremely sensitive to mutation in an upstream region containing the octanucleotide sequence ATGCAAAT. Significant IgH mRNA levels were detected in RNA from cells transfected with IgH gene constructs in which all upstream sequences on the 5' proximal side of this element were deleted. Similar results were obtained using the precise inverse of the IgH octamer, which is found in the upstream promoter region of immunoglobulin light chain genes. Deletion of the IgH octamer, or point mutation of adenine to guanine at position 6, resulted in the loss of correctly initiated IgH mRNA. A DNA binding factor from J558L nuclear extracts was identified that appeared to recognize the octamer on the basis of differential binding to homologous restriction fragments containing the various mutations and that bound preferentially with octamer DNA fragments derived from functional relative to nonfunctional IgH constructs. Collectively, these data suggest that the octamer element contains residues that are critical to accurate immunoglobulin gene transcription and that may serve as part of a recognition locus for nuclear factors important to B-cell-specific immunoglobulin expression.\r"

In this study, we generated site-directed mutations in the Tac antigen cDNA to generate mutant receptors in which Ser-247 or Thr-250, a probable site of minor phosphorylation, was replaced with another amino acid that is not accessible to phosphorylation. Study of the expression of these mutant genes in a T-lymphoid cell line has provided no evidence as to the essential role of the above-mentioned residues in determining the degree of receptor affinity, its ability for signal transduction, and phorbol ester-mediated regulation of the receptor. Our results strongly suggest the existence of an IL-2 receptor \"complex\" in which the Tac antigen is associated with another molecule(s) that is involved in receptor structure, function, and regulation.\r"

The latter produce decreased prostaglandins E2 and I2 and leukotriene C4 while conserving the synthesis of thromboxane A2. We show here that the initial changes in peritoneal macrophage arachidonate metabolism during the immune response appear to be the result of the large influx of blood monocytes, which have a characteristic metabolism distinct from resident macrophages. We demonstrate that the initial decrease in peritoneal macrophage arachidonate metabolism and the increase in macrophage numbers occur simultaneously after infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Also the macrophage arachidonate metabolism seen at the height of the peritoneal cellular influx is the same as that of purified blood monocytes. Both Listeria peritoneal macrophages and blood monocytes produce equal or greater quantities of thromboxane A2 relative to prostaglandins I2 and E2 or leukotriene C4 whereas resident cells produce 1/10 to 1/25 as much thromboxane A2 compared to the other products. Furthermore, the changes in peritoneal macrophage arachidonate metabolism in response to Listeria infection do not occur if the influx of blood monocytes is stopped by irradiating the mice prior to infection implying that the cellular influx is necessary to see the changes in arachidonate metabolism. Finally, activation of peritoneal macrophages, measured as an increase in Ia expression, occurs 36 hr after the influx of monocytes from the blood and the resultant shift in arachidonate metabolism during Listeria infection.\r"

Antigenic stimulation of either a keyhole-limpet-hemocyanin-specific TH-cell line or two keyhole-limpet-hemocyanin-specific T-cell clones resulted in the secretion of IL-4 but not interleukin 2 (IL-2). The secretion of IL-4 was first detected in the culture supernatant 6-8 hr after antigenic stimulation. Induction of IL-4 secretion was antigen specific and major histocompatibility complex restricted. Antigenic stimulation also resulted in increased responsiveness of the TH cells to exogenously added or endogenously produced IL-4. The antigen-induced proliferation of the TH cells could be inhibited by an anti-IL-4 antibody but not by an anti-IL-2-receptor antibody. These results suggest that IL-4 mediates the proliferation of some TH cells by an antigen-induced autocrine mechanism. Taken together with past results, these data indicate that, during T-cell-B-cell interactions involving some soluble protein antigens, IL-4 and not IL-2 is the critical lymphokine for activating resting B cells and inducing proliferation of the TH cells.\r"

Although IL-2 binding was reported to be restricted to the Tac peptide, we have identified an IL-2 binding peptide that does not react with anti-human IL-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies, including anti-Tac on MLA 144, a gibbon ape T-cell line. The MLA 144 cell line expressed 6800 IL-2 binding sites per cell with a low (Kd = 14 nM) affinity for human recombinant IL-2. Using cross-linking methodology, we demonstrated that the IL-2 binding peptide on MLA 144 is larger (Mr 75,000) than the Tac peptide, which has a Mr of 55,000. An IL-2 binding peptide of similar size (Mr 75,000) was also identified in addition to the Tac peptide (Mr 54,000-57,000) on Hut 102, a human T-cell lymphotrophic virus I-induced T-cell leukemia line, and phytohemagglutinin-activated normal human and gibbon ape lymphoblasts. Anti-Tac antibody did not block the binding of 125I-labeled IL-2 to MLA 144 cells. However, this antibody abolished the binding of 125I-labeled IL-2 not only to the Tac peptide on Hut 102 cells and normal lymphoblasts but also to the Mr 75,000 IL-2 binding peptide, suggesting that this latter peptide is associated with the Tac peptide to form the high-affinity IL-2 receptor complex.\r"

  ".U": "87092318\r", 
  ".W": "A molecular recognition code has been hypothesized to exist in which ligands and their binding sites are encoded on complementary segments of genomic DNA. We have tested this hypothesis by generating a rabbit antibody to a synthetic decapeptide (complementary peptide) encoded by an RNA complementary to the mRNA for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and determining whether this antibody recognizes the LHRH receptor. When the antibody was used for immunoperoxidase staining of enzymatically dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells, only those that contained and secreted luteinizing hormone (i.e., the gonadotropes) were recognized. This staining could be abolished by preincubation with the complementary peptide or with an LHRH agonist, suggesting that the antibody is specific to the complementary peptide and is directed at the binding site of the receptor. Further evidence that the antibody recognizes the LHRH receptor was obtained in immunoblot experiments on solubilized receptors from pituitary glands. Immunoperoxidase staining with the antibody revealed two bands at 60 kDa and 51 kDa, which are values similar to those previously obtained for the LHRH receptor in photoaffinity-labeling experiments. The staining of these bands was inhibited by preincubation with the complementary peptide or an LHRH agonist. The antibody as well as the complementary peptide to LHRH also suppressed LHRH-stimulated luteinizing hormone release in a quantitative reverse hemolytic plaque assay, presumably by binding to the LHRH receptor and by binding LHRH, respectively. These findings suggest that the synthetic decapeptide whose sequence is specified by the complementary RNA to LHRH mRNA is sufficiently similar to an LHRH binding site that the peptide not only binds LHRH but was also recognized by the immune system as such a site. These findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that recognition molecules are encoded by complementary segments of genomic DNA.\r"

  ".W": "After prolonged visual adaptation of Drosophila, dramatic long-term changes of in vitro phosphorylation of a 50-kDa brain protein that is identical to the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37) can be measured in isolated heads. By selective receptor cell desensitization in blue light, subcellular distribution of the 50-kDa kinase in fly brain is modified, and Ca2+-stimulated in vitro phosphorylation is increased. Concomitantly the 50-kDa kinase is translocated by in vitro phosphorylation from the membrane-cytoskeleton complex into the cytoplasm. After adaptation, association of the enzyme to the membrane shows long-term modification. In yellow light, which reverts receptor cell adaptation within seconds, the changes in kinase activity and distribution remain for about 2 hr, corresponding to the duration of behavioral modification induced by blue light. Reducing protein synthesis with cycloheximide inhibits the induction of behavioral modification as well as the prolonged modulation of the 50-kDa kinase by blue light. From our simple assay to measure biochemical changes induced in the intact organism by sensory stimulation, we propose that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II is involved in long-term modulation of synaptic transmission.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured IM-9 lymphocytes were preincubated with 1 microM insulin, a condition resulting in a 56% reduction in cell surface insulin receptors. Cellular proteins were then metabolically labeled, and the radioactivity incorporated into the insulin proreceptor and receptor mature subunits was measured over a 4-hr chase period. As early as 30 min of chase, incorporation into the proreceptor was 28 +/- 6% higher in down-regulated cells than in control cells (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.05). By 1 hr of chase, the difference reached 41 +/- 14% for the proreceptor and 84 +/- 28% for the alpha subunit (P less than 0.01); values returned to normal by 2 hr. At 4 hr of chase, labeling of the alpha subunit of down-regulated cells was diminished 36 +/- 9% below control (P less than 0.05). The increased biosynthetic rate of the proreceptor was more prominent when the chase medium contained 25 microM monensin, an inhibitor of processing of the proreceptor into mature subunits. Similar effects occurred whether [3H]mannose or [3H]lysine was used as biosynthetic marker. The effect was specific for the insulin receptor. These data demonstrate that insulin receptor homologous down-regulation is associated with increased proreceptor biosynthesis and processing into mature subunits. This might represent a cellular mechanism compensating for insulin-induced receptor loss.\r"

We used Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase as a marker gene and demonstrate a high level of expression of this marker from the viral long terminal repeat promoter, with simultaneous expression of the Tn5 neo gene from the simian virus 40 early promoter. This expression has allowed us to detect individual infected cells histochemically. We applied this marking technique to the study of lineage relationships in the developing vertebrate nervous system, both in vivo and in culture. In the rat retina, we injected virus in vivo and histochemically identified clones of marked neural cells. In addition, we used this virus to infect cultures of rat cerebral cortex and have analyzed the clonal relationships of morphologically different neural cell types. The host range of the marking system extends to avian as well as mammalian species. Thus, this system should have broad applicability as a means of gene transfer and expression in the nervous system.\r"

Three copies of the retrovirus-like transposon roo are involved in the exchanges.

One of these cDNA clones was confirmed to be full-length by DNA sequencing and by expression of Ly-1 by L cells transfected with this clone. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence indicated that the Ly-1 polypeptide is synthesized with a 23 amino acid leader and that the mature protein consists of an amino-terminal region of 347 amino acids, a transmembrane sequence of 30 residues, and a carboxyl-terminal region of 94 amino acids. The amino-terminal region appears to be divided into two subregions by a threonine- and proline-rich sequence of 23 amino acids that is highly conserved between Ly-1 and its human homologue Leu-1 (CD5) in position and amino acid composition. The first amino-terminal subregion of 111 amino acids is predicted to be arranged in a beta-pleated sheet structure of six strands. The entire amino-terminal region is rich in cysteine, with all of its 22 cysteine residues conserved between Ly-1 and Leu-1. The carboxyl-terminal region has no cysteines. Ly-1 and Leu-1 are 63% identical, with a gradient of identical residues from 43% for the first amino-terminal subregion to 58% for the second amino-terminal subregion and 90% for the carboxyl-terminal region. The predicted secondary structure of the first amino-terminal subregion and identities of certain conserved residues among most members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily suggest that Ly-1 and Leu-1 are distant members of this family.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, representing a clonal population of resting B lymphocytes, were induced to differentiate into immunoglobulin-secreting lymphoblasts and plasmablasts by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The induction resulted in a rapid increase in the molar ratio of secreted/membrane-bound mu-chain mRNA. Immunoglobulin secretion was preceded by a transition of the cells from the G0 to G1 phase of the cell cycle, as indicated by an increase in RNA and protein synthesis, and an overall increase in cellular RNA. The cells, however, became blocked in G1 and did not enter S phase. The expression of MYC and FOS was rapidly induced by the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment. The induction of FOS preceded the shift in secreted/membrane-bound mu-chain mRNA molar ratio, while that of MYC occurred concomitantly with the shift, but prior to induction of total RNA synthesis and immunoglobulin secretion. MYC expression remained at a relatively high level during the whole differentiation process. It is thus concluded that a decline of MYC expression is not a prerequisite for differentiation of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. This suggests that MYC expression may play a different role during differentiation of nonproliferating B cells than in the myelomonocytic cell lines HL-60 and U-937, where MYC expression has been reported to decrease during induced differentiation. The results also show that the expression of the MYC and FOS genes does not result in the transition of these cells into the S phase of the cell cycle.\r"

  ".W": "A high peptidylglycine alpha-amidating mono-oxygenase (PAMase) activity has been measured in the pancreas of neonatal rats. A significant fraction of this activity is contained in the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans and is colocalized with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and its precursor in secretory granules. The ontogenetic variation of PAMase activity in the pancrease parallels that of TRH concentrations, suggesting that this enzymatic activity is directly related to TRH biosynthesis. In addition, PAMase activity is able to generate TRH when incubated with less than Glu-His-Pro-Gly, a tetrapeptide present as a repetitive sequence in the TRH precursor. The perinatal evolution of the TRH precursor levels in the pancreas is similar to that of PAMase activity (unpublished results). Thus, the neonatal rat pancreas offers an endocrine model in which the levels of a neuropeptide precursor and an enzyme activity, involved in the posttranslational modification of this precursor, are similarly regulated. Our results suggest also that a fraction of PAMase activity may be produced outside of the beta cells and related to the biosynthesis of COOH-terminally amidated peptide(s) other than TRH. The ontogenetic changes in PAMase activity imply that the synthesis of this peptide(s) is high during the neonatal period, decreasing thereafter.\r"

When patch pipettes were filled with a solution free of divalent cations, inward current through individual light-sensitive ion channels was sufficiently large to allow single-channel recording. Channel activity was suppressed by illumination within the normal response range of the dark-adapted rod. When illumination was restricted to a portion of the outer segment, the effect of light on channel activity was spatially localized to the illuminated region. Hyperpolarization of the recorded patch did not reduce the frequency of channel opening, indicating that the suppression of channel activity by light was due to illumination itself and not to light-induced hyperpolarization of the rod. After recording single light-sensitive channel activity in the intact cell, the patch of membrane was detached to form an excised, inside-out patch. Cyclic GMP applied to the intracellular face of the excised patch then opened a channel that appeared to be the same as the light-sensitive channel recorded earlier from the same membrane in the intact, functioning rod. This provides direct evidence that cyclic GMP acts as an internal transmitter that opens the light-sensitive channel of the vertebrate photoreceptor.\r"

Irradiation of mutant spores also produces spore photoproducts, but again only about one-half the amount formed in comparably irradiated wild-type spores. These findings suggest that the high UV sensitivity of the mutant spores is due to the production of pyrimidine dimers, which are not found in UV-irradiated wild-type spores, and that the high level of small, acid-soluble proteins found in wild-type spores is directly involved in spore UV resistance by facilitating a conformational change in spore DNA, preventing pyrimidine dimer formation.\r"

Between 4 and 10 hr after treatment with rTNF-alpha, HL-60 cells start to exhibit phagocytic activity, indicating the induction of a differentiation process, and show a marked decline in steady-state levels of MYC mRNA. In vitro transcription assays reveal that rTNF-alpha inhibits MYC gene expression at the level of transcription. rTNF-alpha has little or no effect on the half-life of MYC mRNA, indicating that the decreased MYC mRNA level is primarily due to reduced transcription, and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide does not prevent rTNF-alpha-mediated inhibition of MYC gene expression, suggesting that rTNF-alpha action is independent of de novo protein synthesis. In contrast to MYC, HLA-A, -B, -C mRNA levels are slightly increased in rTNF-alpha-treated HL-60 cells. Recombinant interferon-gamma, which also enhances HLA gene transcription in HL-60 cells, fails to reduce MYC mRNA levels and lacks cytostatic activity. Attenuation of HL-60 cell proliferation occurs as a late response to treatment with rTNF-alpha and thus may be secondary to both MYC inhibition and induction of cell differentiation.\r"

Multicopy recombinant plasmids containing the Escherichia coli gyrA gene are able to complement both the growth defects and the elevated his operon expression associated with the hisW mutations. We conclude that hisW mutations are alleles of the gyrA gene. The hisU1820 mutant of S. typhimurium exhibits many of the same phenotypes as hisW mutants. Several lines of evidence, including high transduction linkage to recF, suggest that hisU1820 is an allele of gyrB. Finally, well-characterized gyrA and gyrB alleles of E. coli are also his regulatory mutations. We propose that a wild-type degree of chromosomal superhelicity is required for maximal production of histidyl-tRNA and normal his operon regulation.\r"

Little is known about mechanisms regulating ANP release. In rats with indwelling catheters, acute blood volume expansion with 5% (wt/vol) dextrose increases the amount of circulating immunoreactive ANP by a factor of 2-3, as determined by radioimmunoassay. Pithing, which both removes neurogenic influences and interrupts humoral influences of the brain and pituitary gland on the heart, completely blocked stimulus-induced release of ANP. Because our studies using pharmacological blockade of the autonomic nervous system had suggested that neurogenic mechanisms do not play a major role in ANP release, we sought a humoral mechanism involved in ANP secretion. Basal and stimulated release of ANP were significantly blunted in hypophysectomized rats (8 days after operation) but were completely restored when the resected anterior pituitary was reimplanted under the kidney capsule. This suggests that hormones of anterior pituitary origin are required for ANP secretion in response to acute volume loading.\r"

  ".W": "Data indicating that the 21-kDa protein (p21) Harvey-ras gene product shares sequence homology with guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) has stimulated research on the influence(s) of p21 on G-protein-regulated systems in vertebrate cells. Our previous work demonstrated that NIH-3T3 mouse cells expressing high levels of the cellular ras oncogene isolated from the EJ human bladder carcinoma (EJ-ras) exhibited reduced hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. We now report that in these cells another enzyme system thought to be regulated by G proteins is inhibited, namely phospholipases A2 and C. NIH-3T3 cells incubated in plasma-derived serum release significant levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as determined by radioimmunoassay when exposed to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) at 2 units/ml; the levels of PGE2 released from EJ-ras-transfected cells are only 3% those of controls despite a similar basal (unstimulated) release from control and EJ-ras-transfected cells. The lack of PDGF-stimulated PGE2 release from EJ-ras-transfected cells is not due to a defect in the prostaglandin cyclooxygenase enzyme, since incubation of control cells and EJ-ras-transfected cells in 0.33, 3.3, or 33 microM arachidonate resulted in identical levels of PGE2 release. The lack of PDGF-stimulated PGE2 release from EJ-ras-transfected cells also does not result from the loss of functional PDGF receptors. EJ-ras-transformed cells bind 70% as much 125I-labeled PDGF as control cells and are stimulated to incorporate [3H]thymidine and to proliferate after exposure to PDGF. Moreover, this inhibition is not likely the result of a secondary cellular effect related to the transformed phenotype, since NIH-3T3 cells transformed by v-src released PGE2 at wild-type levels after exposure to PDGF. Determination of total water-soluble inositolphospholipids and changes in the specific activities of phosphatidylcholine in control and EJ-ras-transfected cells demonstrated that PDGF-stimulated phospholipase C and A2 activities are inhibited in the EJ-ras-transfected cells.\r"

Since a Ca-cAMP pathway has been implicated in PGE2 action on the LH-RH neuron, in this study we wished to ascertain if copper exerts its effect on the PGE2 receptor or on a postreceptor component involved in PGE2 action. MEA of adult male rats were incubated for 5 min with 200 microM Cu/histidine (CuCl2 mixed with L-histidine at an equimolar ratio) and then incubated for 15 min either with 10 microM PGE2 (Cu/PGE2), 100 microM forskolin (Cu/forskolin), or 1 mM 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (Cu/cAMP). Controls were incubated without Cu/histidine or with Cu/histidine alone. Basal release of LH-RH was 4.6 +/- 0.45 pg/15 min per MEA (mean +/- SEM). Net stimulated release during the 15-min exposure to PGE2, forskolin, or 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate was 3.6 +/- 0.52, 3.1 +/- 0.39, and 1.6 +/- 0.42 pg/15 min per MEA, respectively. Net stimulated release after exposure to Cu/PGE2, Cu/forskolin, or Cu/cAMP was 12.7 +/- 2.2, 9.9 +/- 1.46, and 1.4 +/- 1.9 pg/15 min per MEA, respectively, indicating that copper amplifies the action of PGE2 and forskolin but not cAMP action. When MEA were exposed to a mixture of PGE2 and forskolin for 15 min, the effects of these two secretagogues on LH-RH release were not additive, regardless of whether the MEA were pretreated with Cu/histidine. In contrast to PGE2 and forskolin, copper did not amplify K+ stimulation of LH-RH release and, moreover, when Cu/histidine-treated MEA were exposed to a mixture of PGE2 and 30 mM K+, the effects of these two secretagogues were additive. These results are supportive of the proposition that PGE2 stimulation of LH-RH release is mediated by the Ca-cAMP pathway and that copper amplification of PGE2 action is a postreceptor event.\r"

Long rDNA spacers had high frequency in the fast line; short spacers, in the slow line. We conclude that enzyme levels affected adaptation under the selective regimes imposed and that the different X-linked rDNA spacer-length phenotypes are either adaptive in themselves or that they mark chromosomal segments carrying genes relevant to adaptation.\r"
