A transcriptional unit of approximately 17 kb was found that includes all three embryonic and adult genes of the cluster. The largest transcript initiates 8 kb upstream of the gene, within a cluster of A + T-rich sequences placed upstream of a matrix attachment point, at one of several CAA(A)T boxes framing a cluster of four TATA boxes. The 5' ends of a group of 2.5-, 5-, and 12-kb globin transcripts accumulating in avian erythroblastosis virus-transformed cells, which transcribe globin genes abortively, map to the sequence ATATATAATAA 1 kb upstream of the embryonic pi-globin gene. This sequence might correspond to a site of RNA processing or of alternative transcription initiation. Transcription of the domain ends about 2 kb downstream of the last gene of the cluster, downstream of an enhancer and immediately upstream of a CR1 repetitive element in an A + T-rich sequence that includes a matrix attachment site. These data indicate that full-domain transcripts including embryonic as well as adult alpha-globin genes exist, and that the region transcribed is framed by A + T-rich linkers and matrix attachment points.\r"

The amplified DNA segments are transcribed into RNA and translated into protein in vitro and the synthesized proteins are used to define functional sites. DARTT was applied to rhesus rotavirus gene segment 4 cDNA in order to create a series of carboxyl-terminal truncations and new amino termini in the encoded VP4 capsid protein. The truncated VP4 polypeptides were tested for reaction with 11 VP4-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to identify the minimum polypeptides required for antibody recognition. Monoclonal antibodies 2G4, M2, and M7, which neutralize a number of serologically distinct rotaviruses, required amino acids 247-474 of VP4 for binding. DARTT is potentially applicable to the identification of discontinuous epitopes and functional domains on a variety of proteins.\r"

Within this intron is a 687-codon open reading frame that, from considerations of similarity between amino acid sequences predicted from this open reading frame and maturase-coding sequences in group II introns of certain fungal mitochondrial genes, appears to encode a maturase-related protein. Transcripts complementary to this broad bean sequence (designated a mat-r gene) were detected among RNAs isolated from broad bean mitochondria. Data obtained from DNA-DNA hybridizations indicated that soybean and corn mtDNAs also contain a mat-r gene and suggested that only one copy of this gene occurs in each plant mtDNA. The putative protein specified by the broad bean mat-r gene contains amino acid sequences characteristic of reverse transcriptases. Because of this, consideration is given to the possibility that the maturase-related protein may be functional in the mechanisms by which plant mtDNA sequences are rearranged and foreign sequences are incorporated into plant mtDNAs.\r"

This compound was designed rationally based on the knowledge of the active site topology and the reported stereospecific proton exchange on ketonic substrate analogue (R)-3-(p-methoxybenzoyl)-2-benzylpropanoic acid [Sugimoto, T. & Kaiser, E. T. (1978) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 100, 7750-7751] by CPA. It is suggested that enzymic deprotonation on the C-5 methylene moiety may result in the transient formation of a ketenimine as the key intermediate that partitions between turnover and enzyme inactivation. The enzyme inactivation exhibited pseudo-first-order kinetics, was irreversible, and could be fully prevented in the presence of the reversible inhibitor benzyl-succinate. The inactivation rate constant, kintact, was evaluated to be 0.083 +/- 0.003 min-1 and kcat was measured at 1.78 +/- 0.06 min-1. In turn, a partition ratio of 28 +/- 3 was calculated. The reversible inhibitor constant (Ki) was measured at 1.8 +/- 0.5 microM, indicative of a high affinity for compound 4 shown by CPA; however, Km for the turnover process was determined at 4.93 +/- 0.43 mM. Kinetic analysis and labeling by the radioactive form of the inactivator suggested that the stoichiometry for protein modification by compound 4 approaches a 1:1 ratio.\r"

Each protein was cleaved by cyanogen bromide and the resultant peptides, separated by HPLC, were sequenced as far as the Edman degradation allowed, giving a total of 61 amino acid residues for gp22 and 105 residues for gp35, which represent 30-50% of their expected length.

Of the 2348 base pairs (bp), 2073 bp encode 691 amino acids representing 76.9 kDa (the SDS/PAGE molecular mass is 72 kDa). RNA blot analysis of human reticulocyte total RNA gives a message size for band 4.2 of 2.4 kb. The amino acid sequence of band 4.2 has homology with two closely related Ca2(+)-dependent cross-linking proteins, guinea pig liver transglutaminase (protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase; protein-glutamine: amine gamma-glutamyltransferase, EC 2.3.2.13) (32% identity in a 446-amino acid overlap) and the a subunit of human coagulation factor XIII (27% identity in a 639-amino acid overlap), a transglutaminase that forms intermolecular gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine bonds between fibrin molecules. The region of greatest identity includes a 49-amino acid stretch of band 4.2, which is 69% and 51% identical with guinea pig liver transglutaminase and the a subunit of factor XIII, respectively, within the regions that contain the active sites of these enzymes. Significantly, within the five contiguous consensus residues of the transglutaminase active site, Gly-Gln-Cys-Trp-Val, band 4.2 has an alanine substituted for cysteine (which is apparently essential for activity). Consistent with this active site substitution, erythrocyte membranes or inside-out vesicles, which contain band 4.2, show no evidence of transglutaminase activity by two types of in vitro assay.\r"

With the whole-cell variation of the patch-clamp technique, T (transient) and L (long-lasting) types of Ca2+ currents were identified. Pharmacological characterization showed that the L current was amplified by the Ca2+ channel stimulator BAY K-8644, but the T current was unaffected. The administration of bPTH-(1-34) produced dose-related inhibition of the L current, which could be reversed by BAY K-8644. The peptide had no effect on the T current. In addition, use of the fluorescent indicator fura-2 showed that bPTH-(1-34) inhibited the KCl-stimulated increase in intracellular free Ca2+ in neuroblastoma cells with L channels but not in cells with T channels. An inactivated (oxidized) preparation of bPTH-(1-34) failed to affect the L current. High-affinity binding of labeled PTH analog to these neuroblastoma cells was also demonstrated. In addition, bPTH-(1-34) inhibited the L current in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells from rat tail artery. These data indicate that, in some tissues, PTH can act as an endogenous blocker of Ca2+ entry.\r"

(i) How will protein native structures and stabilities be affected by single-and double-site mutations? (ii) What is the probability that a randomly chosen sequence of amino acids will be compact and globular under folding conditions? For a large number of different sequences, we search the conformational space exhaustively to find unequivocally the \"native\" conformation(s), of global minimum free energy, for each sequence. We find that replacing nonpolar residues in the core by polar residues is generally destabilizing, that surface sites are less sensitive than core sites, that some mutations increase the degeneracy of native states, and that overall it is most probable that a mutation will be neutral, having no effect on the native structure. These results support a \"Continuity Principle,\" that small changes in sequence seldom have large effects on structure or stability of the native state. The simulations also show that (i) the number of \"convergent\" sequences (different sequences coding for the same native structure) is extremely large and (ii) most sequences become quite dense under folding conditions. This implies that the probability of formation of a globular protein from a random sequence of amino acids by prebiotic or mutational methods is significantly greater than zero.\r"

  ".W": "Mutations in the insulin receptor gene can render the cell resistant to the biological action of insulin. We have studied a patient with leprechaunism (leprechaun/Minn-1), a genetic syndrome associated with intrauterine growth retardation and extreme insulin resistance. Genomic DNA from the patient was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction catalyzed by Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase, and the amplified DNA was directly sequenced. A nonsense mutation was identified at codon 897 in exon 14 in the paternal allele of the patient's insulin receptor gene. Levels of insulin receptor mRNA are decreased to less than 10% of normal in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts and cultured skin fibroblasts from this patient. Thus, this nonsense mutation appears to cause a decrease in the levels of insulin receptor mRNA. In addition, we have obtained indirect evidence that the patient's maternal allele of the insulin receptor gene contains a cis-acting dominant mutation that also decreases the level of mRNA, but by a different mechanism. The nucleotide sequence of the entire protein-coding domain and the sequences of the intron-exon boundaries for all 22 exons of the maternal allele were normal. Presumably, the mutation in the maternal allele maps elsewhere in the insulin receptor gene. Thus, we conclude that the patient is a compound heterozygote for two cis-acting dominant mutations in the insulin receptor gene: (i) a nonsense mutation in the paternal allele that reduces the level of insulin receptor mRNA and (ii) an as yet unidentified mutation in the maternal allele that either decreases the rate of transcription or decreases the stability of the mRNA.\r"

Previously we characterized murine GF-1 as a 413-amino acid polypeptide containing two cysteine-cysteine regions reminiscent of zinc-finger DNA-binding domains. By cross-hybridization to the finger domain of murine GF-1 we have isolated cDNA encoding the human homolog. Peptide sequencing of purified human GF-1 confirmed the authenticity of the human cDNA. The predicted primary sequence of human GF-1 is highly similar to that of murine GF-1, particularly in the DNA-binding region. Although the DNA-binding domains of human, murine, and chicken proteins are remarkably conserved, the mammalian polypeptides are strikingly divergent from the avian counterpart in other regions, most likely those responsible for transcriptional activation. By hybridization to panels of human-rodent DNAs we have assigned the human GF-1 locus to Xp21-11. The localization of the gene to the X chromosome has important implications for hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin syndromes unlinked to the beta-globin cluster and for genetic experiments designed to test the role of the factor in erythroid cell gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "There is a need for individualization of all aspects of cancer therapy. Because of significant heterogeneity within a tumor class, there is a need to develop an in vitro test to accurately gauge tumor aggressiveness. Such a measurement would greatly aid treatment decision making. Current methodologies such as flow cytometry, which lacks unambiguous interpretation of cell-proliferative data, and determination of the thymidine-labeling index, which measures nucleotide uptake in a nonphysiological state, have not reproducibly attained this goal. We have developed an in vitro native-state three-dimensional gel-supported histoculture system that allows the growth of all human solid tumor types for relatively long time periods. The native-state system was used to identify the percent of cells capable of incorporating [3H]thymidine over a 4-day period, which we term the growth fraction index (GFI). We have compared the ability of cancer tissue to proliferate in native-state culture to the stage and histological grade of four major types of human carcinomas: breast, ovarian, colon, and lung. Eighty percent of tumor explants could be evaluated, even when sent from across the country. We have determined that the GFI correlates with tumor stage and grade for breast and ovarian carcinoma. In colon carcinoma, there is a trend toward higher GFIs in tumors of more advanced stage and grade. In non-small cell lung carcinomas, GFI, stage, and grade do not correlate. These results suggest the applicability of gel-supported three-dimensional native-state histoculture for prognostic purposes in patients with breast and ovarian cancers and demonstrate the clinical relevance of the native-state histoculture system.\r"

In 60-75% of the families, location of an XLRP gene was estimated at 1 centimorgan distal to OTC, and in 25-40% of the families, an XLRP locus was located halfway between DXS14 (p58-1) and DXZ1 (Xcen), with an estimated recombination fraction of 25% between the two XLRP loci. There is also good evidence for a third XLRP locus, midway between DXS28 (C7) and DXS164 (pERT87), supported by a likelihood ratio of 293:1 for three versus two XLRP loci.\r"

  ".W": "Measures of complexity derived from ergodic theory of dynamical systems were developed and applied to an exemplary data set describing locomotor movements of rats in a bounded space. A symbolic dynamical system was obtained by partitioning the event space into equally probable partition elements, using a k-dimensional tree. The measures calculated from the symbolic sequences included the topological entropy (ht)--i.e., the rate of increase of all possible sequences with increasing sequence length--and the metric entropy (hm)--i.e., the rate of increase of all likely sequences with increasing sequence length. These measures were used to assess changes in rat locomotor behavior as recorded in the behavioral pattern monitor (BPM) that were induced by amphetamine (0.25, 0.50, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 mg/kg). Amphetamine increased the mean activity, ht, and hm. MDMA resulted in a monotonic dose-response curve for activity but exhibited a biphasic dose response in ht and hm. In particular, some animals in the higher dose groups showed a ht in the range of the saline controls, whereas other animals exhibited a significantly reduced ht and a greater decrease in hm, suggesting that two different behavioral reactions coexist within the same higher dose range of MDMA. An important implication of our method is that, in applied ergodic measure-theoretic approaches, the partition that determines the elements of the symbolic dynamical system should not be specified a priori on abstract mathematical grounds but should be chosen relative to its significance with respect to the data set in question. Here, the animal constructs its own spatiotemporal partition in behavioral phase space.\r"

In biological systems the formation of histamine from its precursor histidine is catalyzed by the enzyme L-histidine decarboxylase (HDC; L-histidine carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.22). We have cloned HDC-encoding cDNA from a fetal rat liver cDNA library (phage lambda gt11) have deduced the amino acid sequence from the nucleotide sequence. The clone was proven to be HDC cDNA by expression of active recombinant enzyme in COS cells and by chromosomal mapping. The cDNA encodes a protein of Mr 73,450 (655 amino acid residues). The discrepancy between this molecular weight and the size of the purified fetal liver protein subunits [Taguchi, Y., Watanabe, T., Kubota, H., Hayashi, H. & Wada, H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5214-5221] (Mr = 54,000) suggests that HDC may be posttranslationally processed. The 469 amino acid residues from the amino-terminal portion of the protein share 50% identity with rat and Drosophila L-dopa decarboxylases and much less homology with other characterized amino acid decarboxylases.\r"

No information has been available about the possible occurrence of this rearrangement in human tumors. To facilitate rapid screening of human cell lines and tumor samples for this specific gene rearrangement, we developed a sensitive detection method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of TPR-MET mRNA. cDNA was generated from cellular transcripts by using one of the PCR primers, which was then used as a template for PCR amplification of a 205-base-pair region carrying the breakpoint. An end-labeled internal probe was hybridized in solution to an aliquot of the PCR product for detecting amplification. Cells could be directly screened by the assay without prior isolation of RNA. A 205-base-pair DNA fragment characteristic of the TPR-MET rearrangement was detected in cell lines previously known to contain this altered sequence. The rearrangement was also detected at very low levels in the parental (nontransformed) cell line, HOS TE-85. A preliminary survey of cell lines derived from a variety of human tumors indicates that TPR-MET rearrangement occurred and was expressed at very low frequencies by cells from 7 of 14 tumors of nonhematopoietic origin.\r"

The virus could not be recovered from nonactivated cells. Cultures of lymphocytes infected with the RK virus exhibited a cytopathic effect, and electron microscopic analyses revealed a characteristic herpesvirus structure. RK virus DNA did not hybridize with large probes derived from herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, and human cytomegalovirus. The genetic relatedness of the RK virus to the recently identified T-lymphotropic human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) was investigated by restriction enzyme analyses using 21 different enzymes and by blot hybridization analyses using 11 probes derived from two strains of HHV-6 (Z29 and U1102). Whereas the two HHV-6 strains exhibited only limited restriction enzyme polymorphism, cleavage of the RK virus DNA yielded distinct patterns. Of the 11 HHV-6 DNA probes tested, only 6 cross-hybridized with DNA fragments derived from the RK virus. Taken together, the maximal homology amounted to 31 kilobases of the 75 kilobases tested. We conclude that the RK virus is distinct from previously characterized human herpesviruses. We propose to designate it as the prototype of a new herpesvirus, the seventh human herpesvirus identified to date.\r"

Previous work implicates either an increase in the number of functional channels or graded changes in the gating of individual channels. We now find that single cardiac Ca channels display three patterns of activity (\"modes\") and that isoproterenol or 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate redistributes the relative proportions of modes such that the two most active (mode 1, bursts of brief openings; mode 2, very long-lasting openings) are favored (P less than 0.05; n = 7). Conversely, a pattern of sparse brief openings (mode 0a) is selectively inhibited (P less than 0.01). Despite differences in the relative frequencies of the various modes before and during drug exposure, the gating within each mode is not detectably changed. We conclude that potentiation of highly active modes of Ca channel gating underlies the enhancement of calcium influx by beta-adrenergic stimulation.\r"

We have recorded unitary and whole-cell currents to determine the mechanism by which dopamine enhances ion channels activated by these agents. In single-channel recordings from cell-attached patches with agonist in the patch pipette, the frequency of 5- to 10-pS unitary events, but not their amplitude, increased by as much as 150% after application of dopamine to the rest of the cell. The duration of channel openings also increased somewhat, by 20-30%. In whole-cell experiments, agonists with and without dopamine were applied to voltage-clamped horizontal cells by slow superfusion. Analysis of whole-cell current variance as a function of mean current indicated that dopamine increased the probability of channel opening for a give agonist concentration without changing the amount of current passed by an individual channel. For kainate, noise analysis additionally demonstrated that dopamine did not alter the number of functional channels. Dopamine also increased a slow spectral component of whole-cell currents elicited by kainate or glutamate, suggesting a change in the open-time kinetics of the channels. This effect was more pronounced for currents induced by glutamate than for those induced by kainate. We conclude that dopamine potentiates the activity of horizontal cell glutamate receptors by altering the kinetics of the ion channel to favor the open state.\r"

In the present study, we demonstrate an autocrine mechanism of TNF-alpha-mediated HIV induction. Stimulation of U1 and ACH-2 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) resulted in the induction of TNF-alpha mRNA and the secretion of TNF-alpha. Of note is the fact that anti-TNF-alpha antibodies significantly suppressed the expression of HIV in PMA-stimulated U1 and ACH-2 cells. Furthermore, anti-TNF-alpha antibodies also suppressed both the constitutive and inducible levels of viral expression in the chronically infected promonocytic clone U33.3. This study illustrates the interrelationship between the regulation of HIV expression and normal immunoregulatory mechanisms in that virus expression, both constitutive and induced, can be modulated by an autocrine pathway involving TNF-alpha, a cytokine involved in the complex network of regulation of the normal human immune response.\r"

Prior to serological analysis with polyclonal rabbit antisera, HA and NA antigens of four viruses of each subtype were segregated by genetic reassortment to forestall nonspecific steric hindrance during antigen-antibody combination. This analysis has demonstrated that with respect to antigenic phenotype, HA and NA proteins have evolved at different rates. With H1N1 viruses, an arrest of significant evolution of the NA discordant with the continuing antigenic drift of HA was found in the 1980-1983 period. It is probable that the different and independent rates of evolution of HA and NA reflect the greater selective pressure of HA antibodies, which forces the more rapid emergence of HA escape mutants. The slower antigenic change found for NA further supports the potential for NA-specific infection-permissive immunization as a useful stratagem against influenza.\r"

The studies presented in this paper support the hypothesis that the transfer of VSG from trypanosomes to erythrocytes could lead to one of the pathological features associated with trypanosome infection--i.e., anemia. Migration of trypanosome VSG from live trypanosomes to target cells (sheep erythrocytes) could be shown by preincubating erythrocytes with trypanosomes and subsequently testing the washed erythrocytes for insertion of VSG by their susceptibility to lysis by complement in the presence of an anti-VSG antibody. Complement-mediated lysis was found to depend on the strain-specific anti-VSG antibody used. Extent of erythrocyte lysis increased with time of cell exposure to trypanosomes and with trypanosome concentration. No erythrocyte lysis was observed when trypanosomes were preincubated with anti-VSG antibody before adding erythrocytes. Purified membrane-form VSG (which retains the glycolipid anchor), but not soluble VSG (which no longer has the terminal diacylglycerol moiety), could sensitize erythrocytes to anti-VSG antibody-mediated complement lysis. The intermembrane transfer of VSG from trypanosomes to cells of the infected host could provide a molecular mechanism for the pathogenesis of trypanosomiasis.\r"

Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that casein kinase II in the cytosol of EGF-treated cells contained approximately 3-fold more incorporated [32P]phosphate than did its counterpart in untreated cells. Levels of kinase phosphorylation paralleled levels of kinase activity over a wide range of EGF concentrations as well as over a time course of hormone action. Approximately 97% of the incorporated [32P]phosphate was found in the beta subunit of casein kinase II. Both activated and hormone-naive kinase contained radioactive phosphoserine and phosphothreonine but no phosphotyrosine. On the basis of proteolytic mapping experiments, EGF treatment of A-431 cells led to an increase in the average [32P]phosphate content (i.e., hyperphosphorylation) of casein kinase II beta subunit peptides which were modified prior to hormone treatment. Finally, the effect of alkaline phosphatase on the reaction kinetics of activated casein kinase II indicated that hormonal stimulation of the kinase resulted from the increase in its phosphorylation state.\r"

  ".W": "A specific type of premessenger ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle, Balbiani ring (BR) granules, has been isolated from heterogeneous nuclear RNP (hnRNP) in the salivary glands of the dipteran Chironomus tentans. A BR granule contains a single 75S RNA molecule coding for a large secretory protein (Sp1). The isolation procedure is based on the abundance and exceptional size of the BR granules: in EDTA-containing sucrose gradients they sediment as a sharp 300S peak ahead of the remainder of the hnRNP population. The isolated BR granules were identified on the basis of both ultrastructural and biochemical criteria: large spherical particles that contain 75S RNA and BR sequences. A three-dimensional reconstruction of isolated particles by electron microscope tomography further supported the identification of the isolated particles as BR granules. In contrast to the entire hnRNP population, the BR granules exhibited a sharp peak in CsCl gradients with a buoyant density of 1.45 g/cm3. This result indicates that a BR granule consists of 40% RNA and 60% protein by weight, corresponding to a 75S RNA molecule of 12 megadaltons and a total protein content of 18 megadaltons, or about 500 average-sized protein molecules.\r"

  ".W": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a multigene complex of tightly linked homologous genes that encode cell surface antigens that play a key role in immune regulation and response to foreign antigens. In most species, MHC gene products display extreme antigenic polymorphism, and their variability has been interpreted to reflect an adaptive strategy for accommodating rapidly evolving infectious agents that periodically afflict natural populations. Determination of the extent of MHC variation has been limited to populations in which skin grafting is feasible or for which serological reagents have been developed. We present here a quantitative analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism of MHC class I genes in several mammalian species (cats, rodents, humans) known to have very different levels of genetic diversity based on functional MHC assays and on allozyme surveys. When homologous class I probes were employed, a notable concordance was observed between the extent of MHC restriction fragment variation and functional MHC variation detected by skin grafts or genome-wide diversity estimated by allozyme screens. These results confirm the genetically depauperate character of the African cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, and the Asiatic lion, Panthera leo persica; further, they support the use of class I MHC molecular reagents in estimating the extent and character of genetic diversity in natural populations.\r"

Interestingly, the Drosophila homologue lacks the C-terminal sequences that were postulated to interact with rhodopsin during the quenching of the phototransduction cascade in the vertebrate visual response. These findings are discussed in terms of invertebrate phototransduction. The Drosophila gene was mapped cytogenetically to chromosomal position 36D1-2, near the ninaD locus. However, the arrestin gene does not appear to be the ninaD locus, as sequence analysis of three ethylmethane sulfate-induced ninaD mutant alleles reveals no alteration in amino acid sequence.\r"

Between pH 5.5 and 7, the Asp-85----Glu and Arg-82----Ala mutants exist in a pH-dependent equilibrium between purple (lambda max approximately 550/540 nm) and blue (lambda max approximately 600/590 nm) forms of the pigment. Measurement of proton transport as a function of wavelength in reconstituted vesicles shows that proton-pumping activities for the above mutants reside exclusively in their respective purple species. For both mutants, formation of the blue form with decreasing pH is accompanied by loss of proton transport activity. The Asp-85----Asn mutant displays a blue chromophore (lambda max approximately 588 nm), is inactive in proton translocation from pH 5 to 7.5, and shows no transition to the purple form. In contrast, the Asp-212----Asn mutant is purple (lambda max approximately 555 nm) and shows no transition to a blue chromophore with decreasing pH. The experiments suggest that (i) the pKa of the purple-to-blue transition is directly influenced by the pKa of the carboxylate at residue 85 and (ii) the relative strengths of interaction between the protonated Schiff base, Asp-85, Asp-212, and Arg-82 make a major contribution to the regulation of color and function of bacteriorhodopsin.\r"

Upon incorporation of this extract into asolectin vesicles by the freeze-thaw-sonication technique, a p-chloromercuribenzoate-sensitive, protein-dependent transport of alpha-ketoisocaproate into the proteoliposomes was observed. Significant inhibition of alpha-ketoisocaproate transport was observed in the reconstituted system with branched-chain alpha-keto acids (64-83%) and the related carboxylates alpha-ketocaproate (58%) and alpha-ketovalerate (49%), but not with substrates for the pyruvate carrier (less than 5%). The reconstituted carrier was substantially inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, by the histidine-specific reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate, and by the tyrosine-specific reagent N-acetylimidazole. The extraction and functional reconstitution of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid transporter represents an important first step towards purification and molecular characterization of this anion carrier.\r"

To elucidate the role of HTLV-I in leukemogenesis, we examined the biological activity of a defective HTLV-I provirus with the env-pX 3' long terminal repeat region cloned from leukemic cells of an ATL patient. Transfection experiments showed growth stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells--growing beyond the saturation density and growing in soft agar. Since the pX sequence is known to encode three proteins, Tax, Rex, and p21x, the biological activity of each pX gene was examined separately. The growth-stimulating activity was induced only by the tax gene in NIH 3T3 cells and Rat-1 cells. Furthermore, the tax gene induced tumorigenicity in nude mice when introduced into Rat-1 cells. Thus, a transcriptional transactivator gene of HTLV-I, tax, is clearly identified as a viral oncogene without a cellular homolog. The transforming activity of tax, possibly via a transcriptional deregulation of cell growth control, may play an important role in leukemogenesis of ATL in addition to its aberrant stimulation of the interleukin 2 system.\r"

Since exogenous H2O2 induces in human monocytes the synthesis of HSPs, and previous induction of HSPs protects these cells from oxidative injury, we investigated whether HSP synthesis was also induced during generation of reactive oxygen species by the phagocyte itself during phagocytosis. As a model system, we analyzed the effects of erythrophagocytosis on protein synthesis by the human premonocytic line U937, in which phagocytosis is induced during differentiation with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Exposure to whole erythrocytes, but not to erythrocyte ghosts, induced in the phagocytic cells only the synthesis of the 70- and 83- to 90-kDa HSPs and a 32-kDa oxidation-related stress protein identical by partial peptide mapping to heme oxygenase. The radioprotective aminothiol N-(2'-mercaptoethyl)-1,3-propanediamine (WR-1065), which can substitute for glutathione as hydrogen donor, prevented this induction. These results suggest that oxygen free radicals generated in the presence of hemoglobin-derived iron and consecutive glutathione depletion are involved in induction of stress protein synthesis during erythrophagocytosis. HSPs synthesized during phagocytosis may play a role in the phagocyte's defense mechanisms and in protective immunity.\r"

Comparison of its DNA and deduced amino acid sequences with those of the three known myogenic genes (MyoD, myogenin, and Myf-5) reveals scattered short spans with similarity to one or more of these genes and a long span with strong similarity to all three. This long span includes a sequence motif that is also present in proteins of the myc, achaete-scute, and immunoglobulin enhancer-binding families. The herculin gene is physically linked to the Myf-5 gene on the chromosome; only 8.5 kilobases separate their translational start sites. A putative 27-kDa protein is encoded by three exons contained within a 1.7-kilobase fragment of the herculin gene. When expressed under the control of the simian virus 40 early promoter, transfected herculin renders murine NIH 3T3 and C3H/10T1/2 fibroblasts myogenic. In doing so, it also activates expression of myogenin, MyoD, and endogenous herculin in NIH 3T3 recipients. In adult mice, herculin is expressed in skeletal muscle but is absent from smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and all nonmuscle tissues assayed. Direct comparison of the four known myogenic regulators in adult muscle showed that herculin is expressed at a significantly higher level than is any of the others. This quantitative dominance suggests an important role in the establishment or maintenance of adult skeletal muscle.\r"

Ninety-six percent of the patients were positive for the A3 allele compared to 53% of the controls (P = 0.001; relative risk = 19.7; confidence limits = 3.72-188.64). (iii) The DQw8 allele of the DQB1 locus, which is associated with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in Caucasians and Blacks, was not increased in frequency in Japanese patients (22%) versus controls (19%). (iv) Asp-57-encoding DQB1 alleles are associated with reduced susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in Caucasians. The major predisposing haplotypes in Japanese are DR4 and DR9. By DNA sequence analysis, both of these Japanese haplotypes have Asp-57-encoding DQB1 alleles. Oligonucleotide dot blot analysis showed that all, except 1, of the 49 Japanese patients and all of the 31 controls have at least one Asp-57-encoding DQB1 allele. In addition, 40% of the patients were homozygous for Asp-57-encoding DQB1 alleles versus 35% of the controls. The high frequencies of Asp-57-encoding DQB1 alleles in this ethnic group may account for the rarity of type 1 diabetes in Japan.\r"

The structurally related basic FGF did not have such an effect; both factors, however, had a mitogenic activity for these cells. Two distinct populations of receptors for acidic FGF and basic FGF were distinguished by their ligand-binding characteristics. The observations that both acidic and basic FGFs had a mitogenic effect on NBT-II cells and that only acidic FGF caused cell dissociation and dispersion strongly suggest that these two biological activities could be medicated through distinct signaling pathways.\r"

For high contrast stimuli, lesions restricted to area 17 or area 18 had little effect, but those lesions involving area 17 and a substantial part of area 18 raised thresholds. In the latter case there was a relationship between the amount of area 18 spared and the bar width at which discrimination was impaired. At low contrast deficits were seen only for narrow widths. These results lead to the following conclusions. (i) Orientation discrimination is a function distributed within and across areas 17 and 18. (ii) How this function is distributed in this cortex depends on stimulus width. (iii) The X system does not carry the signal necessary for orientation discrimination. (iv) Cells most narrowly tuned for orientation, which reside in the part of area 17 subserving central vision, do not determine the orientation discrimination threshold.\r"

Nonneuronal cells resident in peripheral nerve are suggested to play an important role in neural repair mechanisms through diffusable molecules that they synthesize and secrete. We examined the array of proteins synthesized and secreted by nonneuronal cells resident in the frog peripheral nerve, which is known for its high regenerative capacity. Nerve segments were incubated in medium containing [35S]methionine, and the secreted radioactively labeled proteins were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Nerve injury resulted in the complete down-regulation of a group of proteins synthesized and secreted by nonneuronal cells in intact nerve. At the same time, the synthesis and secretion of several proteins were up-regulated in the neuroma and degenerating nerve segments, proximal and distal to the axotomy site, respectively. Proteins secreted by the proximal segment were of apparent kDa/pI (mass/isoelectric point) values of 215/5.6, 76/6.7, 73/7.0, 44/5.2, 36.5/5.6, 35.5/6.0, and 32/6.0. Similar proteins were secreted by the degenerating distal segment but with the exception of variable reductions in the 44- and 32-kDa proteins and increases in proteins of apparent kDa/pI values of 39/5.2 and 29/7.3-7.4. Step gradient ultracentrifugation suggested that the latter two are apolipoproteins. Comparison with plasma apolipoproteins further indicated that nerve and plasma apolipoproteins differ. The up-regulation of the synthesis and secretion of these proteins concurrently with nerve degeneration and regeneration strongly imply that these molecules are involved in neuronal repair mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "90138958\r", 
  ".W": "Myosin is a ubiquitous eukaryotic contractile protein that generates the force responsible for such diverse cellular movements as muscle contraction and cytokinesis. Although there have been numerous studies of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes, no molecular clones have been reported that encode mammalian nonmuscle MHC. This study presents the molecular genetic characterization of a human nonmuscle MHC that is expressed in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Human nonmuscle MHC amino acids are weakly homologous (33%) to sarcomeric MHC but are approximately 72% identical to smooth muscle MHC. In contrast to vertebrate sarcomeric MHCs, which generate diversity through the expression of members of a multigene family, an alternative polyadenylylation site is used in the nonmuscle MHC gene to generate multiple transcripts that encode the same protein. We have mapped this gene to chromosome 22. It is thus unlinked to either of the sarcomeric MHC gene clusters on human chromosomes 14 and 17.\r"

  ".W": "A subset of tumor suppressor genes presumably functions by the inhibition of cellular proliferation; however, antiproliferative activity after transfection with putative suppressor genes has been difficult to demonstrate and often requires lengthy selection either in nude mice or in vitro. A rapid alternative is presented here that utilizes a gene encoding a surface marker protein to identify transfectants in a transient expression assay. In this assay the labeling index, rate of DNA synthesis, cell-cycle distribution, and surface receptor display are measured by flow cytometry. Human beta-interferon, a gene with proven antiproliferative activity, was studied using the transient analysis system. The beta-interferon gene was introduced into human tumor cells along with the marker gene encoding the 55-kDa subunit of the human interleukin 2 receptor. Within a few days of transfection, analysis of transfectants by flow cytometry revealed a decrease in the fraction of cells in G2/M and an increase in the fraction of cells in G1/G0 and S phases. The distortion of the cell cycle was accompanied by as much as a 69% reduction in the rate of DNA synthesis and, in some experiments, an unanticipated increase in the labeling index. Therefore, cells accumulating in S phase were not blocked but continued to synthesize DNA although at a reduced rate. These studies on DNA synthetic rates revealed the caveat that screening for antiproliferative candidate genes with a labeling index alone could, in certain circumstances, exclude potentially interesting sequences from further consideration. Although this transient analysis system was developed for studies on cellular proliferation, it may prove suitable for phenotypic assays on other genes as well.\r"

  ".W": "The major form of complement component C4b-binding protein, a regulator of the complement system, is composed of seven identical 70-kDa alpha chains, each containing a binding site for the complement protein C4b. We recently showed that C4b-binding protein also contains a unique 45-kDa beta chain. It is disulfide-linked to the central core and contains a binding site for the vitamin K-dependent protein S. We have now isolated and characterized full-length cDNA clones for the beta chain. In addition, 57% of the structure was determined by protein sequencing of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides. Two clones, A8 and C1, isolated from different libraries were sequenced. Except for a deleted triplet encoding Ala-3 in clone A8, the two clones were identical and coded for a leader sequence of 17 amino acids and a mature protein of 235 amino acids (including Ala-3). By N-terminal amino acid sequencing, the Ala-3 heterogeneity was confirmed and a third beta-chain species starting at Glu-4 was identified. The beta chain contains five potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and endoglycosidase digestion suggested that the beta chain contained multiple complex carbohydrate side chains. Northern blot analysis of human liver mRNA, using the beta-chain cDNA as the probe, demonstrated a major mRNA species of approximately 1.0 kilobase. From the N terminus, the beta chain contains three tandem repeat units (60 amino acids long) that are homologous to those present in the alpha chain. The C-terminal region, which was unrelated to the tandem repeats, demonstrated sequence similarity with the corresponding region of the alpha chain. In both alpha and beta chains these regions contain two cysteine residues that probably form the interchain disulfide bridges.\r"

We present a molecular model for the DNA structure that conforms to dimethyl sulfate methylation data. The principal element of this G-DNA structure is a quadruple helix formed by pairwise antiparallel segments of the twice-folded (dG)n stretch. This quadruple core has two wide and two narrow grooves connected by three loop-shaped segments. The strong stacking interactions of the neighboring guanine tetrads and the large number of hydrogen bonds formed can be the primary reasons that such structures are favored over a common hairpin for long (dG)n stretches. Such compact structures may be formed from (dG)n stretches of telomeric sequences.\r"

  ".W": "We have designed, synthesized, crystallized, and performed x-ray analysis of several hydrophobic tripeptides that show an extended near alpha-helical structure in the crystalline state. All of the tripeptides that show this remarkably stable helix crystallize with two or three water molecules; they all have glycine at the N terminus and have increasing hydrophobicity as one moves from the N to C terminus. Even though three residues in the oligomer are not sufficient to complete a turn, one of the water molecules acts as an added residue and links up adjacent tripeptide segments along the helix axis so that in the crystal, the helix appears effectively as one long continuous helix. Two of these tripeptides are stabilized by two water molecules that enable the peptides to complete a turn of the helix and extend the helical structure throughout the crystal by linking translationally related peptides by hydrogen bonds. In two other peptides, these roles are played by three rather than two water molecules. Though these tripeptides have different crystal symmetry, they all show the basic pattern of hydrated helix and packing, indicating the strong conformational preference for a stable structure even for these tripeptides. Such conformationally stable hydrated structures for short specific related sequences illustrate their possible importance in nucleating protein folding and in the role water molecules play in such events.\r"

  ".U": "90138980\r", 
  ".W": "The body-wall muscle cells of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans produce thick filaments during embryonic, larval, and adult stages. These thick filaments contain two myosin isoforms, A and B, which assemble into different zones along the 10-microns lengths. Paramyosin, a protein homologous to myosin rods, forms a substratum for the myosins. The three filament proteins are encoded by different genes: myo-3 V (myosin heavy chain A), unc-54 I (myosin heavy chain B), and unc-15 I (paramyosin). The relative expression of these genes has been studied by run-on nuclear transcription in vitro, hybridization of accumulated mRNA, and immunochemical determination of specific polypeptide accumulation. In late larval nematodes (L4), the relative levels of nuclear run-on transcription per mol of probe are 6.4 unc-54:2.4 myo-3:1.0 unc-15. Similarly, the relative levels of immunospecific proteins are 4.5 unc-15:3.1 unc-54:1.0 myo-3. Most strikingly, the relative mRNA amounts are 50.0 unc-54:12.4 unc-15:1.0 myo-3. Thus, the orders of relative abundance and the quantitative relations of expression of the three functionally related genes change from transcriptional activities to final accumulated product of thick filament proteins. Modulation of the expression appears to involve processes affecting accumulation of mRNA and protein. The great difference in accumulation of the mRNAs for the two myosin heavy chain isoforms A and B may be related to the different roles of the myosins in thick filament assembly.\r"

These genes are expressed within a few hours of the initiation of development; their mRNAs accumulate to a peak at 12 hr and persist until culmination. Both genes have short guanine-rich sequences (G boxes) upstream that have been shown to be involved in transcriptional regulation of other genes expressed during development of Dictyostelium. Their mRNAs code for proteins that are 85% identical. GP24A and GP24B mRNAs code for proteins with a hydrophobic domain followed by a highly charged carboxyl-terminal domain.\r"

  ".W": "Transcriptionally active nuclear extracts were prepared from mouse testes to study the transcription of the testis-specific mouse protamine 2 (Prm-2) gene in vitro. The testicular system is unique among mammalian in vitro transcription systems in regard to its temperature optimum. In extracts made from prepuberal testes, the temperature optimum for in vitro transcription of Prm-2 is 30 degrees C, similar to somatic in vitro systems. However, in adult testis extracts, the optimum temperature for Prm-2 transcription is 20 degrees C. The different temperature optima seen in vitro for prepuberal and adult testes extracts parallels in vivo physiological temperature sensitivities of the differentiating male germ cells. The testis system also differs from other in vitro transcription systems in its divalent metal cation and ionic strength requirements for optimal transcription. The mouse Prm-2 gene is maximally transcribed at a MgCl2 concentration of 3-5 mM and over a KCl concentration range of 40-100 mM. By using the testis in vitro transcription system to study the Prm-2 gene by deletion analysis, we have determined that positive promotion for the gene lies within the region -170 to -82 from the start of transcription. This region contains a putative Sp-1 binding site. Additional upstream sequences appear to repress Prm-2 transcription in a heterologous transcription system.\r"

In the first phase of an experiment that will eventually test at least 3000 gametes, we screened 972 mutagenized gametes for the induction of both lethal and visible mutations with a two-cross breeding protocol. Thirteen mutations mapping within the limits of a segment corresponding to the cytologically visible Df(c Mod-2 sh-1)26DVT deletion were recovered. They represented three phenotypic groups: prenatal lethality (six mutations); a fitness/runting syndrome (three mutations, provisionally designated as fit variants); and a neurological/balance-defect abnormality (four mutations). Complementation analysis provided evidence for a true repeat mutation at the sh-1 (shaker-1) locus (for the neurological mutations) and another at the here defined fit-1 (fitness-1) locus. In addition, four complementation groups were defined by induced lethal mutations; the two other lethal mutations were each part of a cluster. The recovery of the repeat mutations suggests that the EtNU-induced mutation rate, estimated from specific-locus tests, should make it possible to achieve saturation mutagenesis of a chromosomal region. This experiment is providing basic logistical and statistical information on which to base strategies for expanding the functional map of larger segments of the mouse genome by experimental mutagenesis. It is also yielding additional mutations useful in dissecting the functional and molecular complexity of this segment of chromosome 7.\r"

In experimental animals fed a high-cholesterol diet, monocytes adhere to the arterial endothelium and penetrate into the intima where they differentiate into macrophages and ingest lipids thus giving rise to fatty streaks, the earliest type of atherosclerotic plaque. Macrophages express few receptors for normal low density lipoprotein (LDL) but can take up oxidized LDL by way of a scavenger receptor. The present study was designed to investigate the possible role of oxidized LDL in recruitment of resident intimal macrophages. We found that oxidized LDL induced enhanced expression of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on human monocytes and U937 cells, a well-established system for studies of monocytic differentiation. Oxidized LDL also induced enhanced expression of the surface antigen LeuM3 but caused decreased expression of CD4 antigen, a pattern compatible with expression of a more-differentiated macrophage-like phenotype. Oxidized LDL also initiated aggregation of monocytes and U937 cells and stimulated adhesion of U937 cells to cultured endothelial cells. The results indicate that oxidized LDL may contribute to development of atherosclerosis by inducing adhesion of monocytes to the arterial intima and by stimulating intimal monocytes to differentiate into resident macrophages.\r"

In vitro studies have shown that fatty acids can bind to the enzyme and impede its other interactions. In this study we have searched for evidence of fatty acid control of LPL in vivo by rapid infusion of a triacylglycerol emulsion to healthy volunteers. During infusion the activity of LPL but not of hepatic lipase increased in plasma, but to different degrees in different individuals. The time course for the increase in LPL activity differed from that for triacylglycerols but followed the plasma levels of free fatty acids. This was true during infusions and when the emulsion was given as a bolus injection. In particular there were several instances when plasma triacylglycerol levels were very high but free fatty acids and LPL activity remained low. Model studies with bovine LPL showed that fatty acids displace the enzyme from heparin-agarose. We suggest that in situations when fatty acids are generated more rapidly by LPL than they are used by the local tissue, they cause dissociation of the enzyme from its binding to endothelial heparin sulfate and are themselves released into circulation.\r"

  ".W": "The helper T-cell recognition of globular protein antigens requires that the antigen be processed and presented by an I-region associated (Ia)-expressing antigen-presenting cell (APC). Processing involves the uptake of antigen into an intracellular, proteolytic, acidic compartment; release of peptide fragments containing the T-cell antigenic determinant; association of these peptides with Ia; and presentation of these complexes on the cell surface for recognition by the specific T cells. The molecular mechanisms by which processed antigenic peptides associate with Ia within the APC are poorly understood. To date, functional antigen-Ia complexes have not been isolated from cells that have processed native antigens, although the resolution of the structure of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I protein indicates that peptide is bound in a groove between two alpha-helical regions of the molecule and synthetic peptides have been demonstrated to bind purified MHC both in detergent solution and incorporated into planar membranes, where the MHC-peptide complexes function to activate specific T cells. Here we demonstrate that Ia purified from APCs that have processed the native globular protein antigen cytochrome c, when incorporated into lipid membranes, stimulates cytochrome c-specific T cells in the absence of exogenous antigenic peptide. The T-cell response to Ia purified from cytochrome c-pulsed APCs shows the same MHC restriction and antigen fine specificity as the response to antigen-pulsed APCs. Indeed, T-cell recognition of pigeon cytochrome c (Pc) shows a well documented high-affinity heteroclitic cross-reaction to insect cytochromes c-namely, those of Drosophila melanogaster (DMc) and tobacco hornworm moth (THMc). The same heteroclitic response is observed when purified Ia from unpulsed cells, incorporated into lipid membranes, is used to present antigenic peptides of Pc and of THMc. Significantly, Ia purified from APCs that have processed DMc is approximately 50-fold more active in stimulating specific T cells compared to Ia purified from APCs that have processed Pc. The peptide-Ia complex isolated here may provide the necessary material for analysis of the physiochemical properties of the processed form of the antigen that is produced by the APC and associates with Ia.\r"

In mammals, early neuronal development has generally been difficult to study because of the size and complexity of the embryos, and the lack of adequate markers. Here we look at the time of earliest axonal outgrowth in the mouse embryo by using specific monoclonal antibodies to stain wholemount preparations. During the period of formation and closure of the neuropore beginning at embryonic day 8.5, we can follow the earliest trigeminal sensory neurons extending axons along stereotyped pathways. In the trigeminal ganglion, an early wave of neurogenesis gives rise to a small number of neurons whose axons pioneer the different trigeminal tracts in the periphery. After a brief pause (12 hr), these primary axons branch out to innervate individual targets. Emerging a day later, secondary fibers extend along the pioneers. By contrast, in the central nervous system, neurons of the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus extend toward the rhombencephalon independently, ignoring preexisting fibers. These results show the existence of an early set of axonal tracts in the mouse peripheral nervous system that may be used for the guidance of later-differentiating neurons.\r"

Overall sequence identity between the 5HT2 and 5HT1c receptors is 49%, but identity within the transmembrane domains is 80%. Expression of both the 5HT2 and 5HT1c receptors in transfected mouse fibroblasts activates phospholipase C signaling pathways and promotes cellular transformation. However, RNA blotting shows that these two receptor subtypes are differentially expressed in the central nervous system. In this manner, structurally and functionally homologous receptor subtypes may elicit distinct physiologic actions.\r"

In the present experiments, we obtained evidence that the SCPs are released under physiological conditions. Specifically, we characterized firing patterns of motor neuron B15 during normal behavior, simulated them in vitro, and demonstrated that this type of neuronal activity produces decreases in SCP levels in neuronal processes and terminals. We also obtained evidence that suggests that enough SCP is released under physiological conditions to modulate neuromuscular activity in the accessory radula closer. We demonstrated that physiological activity of neuron B15 produces significant increases in muscle cAMP levels. Furthermore, increases in the size and relaxation rate of muscle contractions can be produced by changes in stimulation parameters that are also likely to maximize effects of released endogenous SCPA and SCPB.\r"

  ".W": "Pentamidine, diminazene aceturate (Berenil), isometamidium chloride (Samorin), and ethidium bromide, which are important antitrypanosomal drugs, promote linearization of Trypanosoma equiperdum minicircle DNA (the principal component of kinetoplast DNA, the mitochondrial DNA in these parasites). This effect occurs at therapeutically relevant concentrations. The linearized minicircles are protease sensitive and are not digested by lambda exonuclease (a 5' to 3' exonuclease), indicating that the break is double stranded and that protein is bound to both 5' ends of the molecule. The cleavage sites map to discrete positions in the minicircle sequence, and the cleavage pattern varies with different drugs. These findings are characteristic for type II topoisomerase inhibitors, and they mimic the effects of the antitumor drug etoposide (VP16-213, a semisynthetic podophyllotoxin analog) on T. equiperdum minicircles. However, the antitrypanosomal drugs differ dramatically from etoposide in that they do not promote detectable formation of nuclear DNA-protein complexes or of strand breaks in nuclear DNA. Selective inhibition of a mitochondrial type II topoisomerase may explain why these antitrypanosomal drugs preferentially disrupt mitochondrial DNA structure and generate dyskinetoplastic trypanosomes (which lack mitochondrial DNA).\r"

  ".W": "Protein 4.2 (P4.2) comprises approximately 5% of the protein mass of human erythrocyte (RBC) membranes. Anemia occurs in patients with RBCs deficient in P4.2, suggesting a role for this protein in maintaining RBC stability and integrity. We now report the molecular cloning and characterization of human RBC P4.2 cDNAs. By immunoscreening a human reticulocyte cDNA library and by using the polymerase chain reaction, two cDNA sequences of 2.4 and 2.5 kilobases (kb) were obtained. These cDNAs differ only by a 90-base-pair insert in the longer isoform located three codons downstream from the putative initiation site. The 2.4- and 2.5-kb cDNAs predict proteins of approximately 77 and approximately 80 kDa, respectively, and the authenticity was confirmed by sequence identity with 46 amino acids of three cyanogen bromide-cleaved peptides of P4.2. Northern blot analysis detected a major 2.4-kb RNA species in reticulocytes. Isolation of two P4.2 cDNAs implies existence of specific regulation of P4.2 expression in human RBCs. Human RBC P4.2 has significant homology with human factor XIII subunit a and guinea pig liver transglutaminase. Sequence alignment of P4.2 with these two transglutaminases, however, revealed that P4.2 lacks the critical cysteine residue required for the enzymatic crosslinking of substrates.\r"

For example, human neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are expressed only in myelomonocytic precursors, and cytotoxic-T-cell serine proteases are found only in cytotoxic lymphocytes. We have used a cathepsin G cDNA probe to clone two cathepsin G-like genes (designated CGL-1 and CGL-2) from a human genomic library. We have determined that CGL-1 is identical to a previously identified gene (known as CCPI, CTLA I, or cytotoxic serine protease B) that is expressed only in activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We show here that cathepsin G, CGL-1, and CGL-2 are linked on an approximately 50-kilobase locus found on human chromosome 14 at band q11.2. This gene cluster maps to the same chromosomal band as the alpha and delta T-cell receptor genes; this region is involved in most chromosomal translocations and inversions that are specifically associated with T-cell malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "RT6 is an unusual cell membrane protein that is expressed exclusively by postthymic T cells. The inherent defect in its expression has been correlated to lymphopenia and genetically determined susceptibility for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the rat. We report here the primary structure of the RT6.2 alloantigen as deduced from the cDNA sequence. The predicted amino acid sequence of RT6.2 begins with a conventional leader of 20 amino acids and ends in a hydrophobic C-terminal extension peptide of 29 amino acids as is common for phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. Native RT6.2 is predicted to comprise 226 amino acids, with a calculated Mr of 26,036. Four cysteine residues account for two intrachain disulfide bonds. The sequence lacks potential N-glycosylation sites and contains an excess of positively charged residues. Homology searches in protein sequence data banks suggest that RT6.2 is not encoded by a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family. Moreover, these analyses did not reveal any close homologies of RT6.2 to known proteins: the highest homology found was 21.2% identity in a 52-amino acid overlap to the torpedo acetylcholinesterase precursor. Southern blot analyses indicate that RT6.2 is the product of a single-copy gene and provide evidence for closely related genes in the mouse and other species. The corresponding gene products remain to be identified.\r"

RNA transcripts derived from recombinant chimeras constructed by exchanging corresponding genomic regions [5' noncoding, leader/P1 (L/P1), P2, P3, and 3' noncoding] between the parental cDNAs were infectious and enabled analysis of the growth characteristics in vitro and mouse neurovirulence of the chimeras. A correlation was found between plaque size and temperature sensitivity and the origin of the L/P1 region. Neurovirulence mapped primarily to the L/P1 region encoding the leader and coat proteins. Depending on parental origin, the 5' noncoding region either influenced virus attenuation or augmented virulence.\r"

We show that the overall retrieval ability in the presence of noise and the memory capacity of the network in the present model are better than in conventional models without such hysteresis. Second-order interaction further improves the retrieval ability of the network and causes hysteresis in the retrieval-noise curve for any arbitrary width of the bistable region. The convergence rate is increased by the hysteresis at high noise levels but is reduced by the hysteresis at low noise levels. Explicit formulae are given for calculations of average final convergence and noise threshold as functions of the width of the bistable region. There is neurophysiological evidence for hysteresis in single neurons, and we propose optical implementations of the present model by using ZnSe interference filters to test the predictions of the theory.\r"

Expression of this antigen is increased in stromal-dependent pre-B cell lines and retrovirally transformed pre-B cells. Expression of the BP-1/6C3 antigen thus correlates with proliferation and transformation of immature B-lineage cells. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of cDNAs encoding the BP-1/6C3 antigen. Northern blot analysis revealed a major 4.1-kilobase mRNA in all BP-1/6C3+ mouse pre-B lines and in a human pre-B cell line. BP-1/6C3 mRNA was either absent or truncated in BP-1/6C3- cell lines. The cDNA sequence predicts a type II integral membrane protein of 945 amino acids with an intracytoplasmic amino terminus of only 17 amino acids and a typical zinc-binding motif in its extracellular domain. BP-1/6C3 has significant homology to aminopeptidase N and is the second member of the zinc-dependent metallopeptidase gene family to be found on the surface of early B-lineage cells.\r"

  ".W": "Restriction site variation in DNA that encodes rRNA (rDNA) was surveyed among 714 offspring within 31 lineages (26 genotypes) of obligate asexually reproducing Taraxacum officinale (dandelions). Although clonal offspring are expected, plants with nonparental rDNA were produced from two parents that were themselves siblings (same genotype). The variation is best characterized by the loss of an EcoRI restriction site that maps to the spacer region in the parental rDNA and is most likely involved in amplification of rare or unique rDNA repeats. In one family, 41 surveyed offspring lacked the EcoRI site. In the other family, only 1 of 26 offspring lost the EcoRI site. Other classes of DNA surveyed, chloroplast DNA and the alcohol dehydrogenase 2 gene (Adh2), showed no variation. However, offspring with nonparental rDNA also had nonparental alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (Adh1) restriction fragments. Because somatic mutations in plants can be incorporated into reproductive tissue, we propose that somatic events affecting at least both multicopy rDNA and DNA homologous to the maize Adh1 gene occurred at different developmental times in the two families. An event early in development would result in all variant offspring; an event late in development would result in a single variant offspring. These results support the view that mutation (in the broad sense) influences the level of genotypic variation in asexual organisms, which may facilitate adaptive evolution of asexual species.\r"

  ".U": "90139310\r", 
  ".W": "The lateral transverse thigh free flap is a horizontal variant of the more commonly known vertical tensor fasciae latae myocutaneous free flap. Fresh cadaver injections of the lateral circumflex femoral artery indicated simultaneous perfusion of the upper lateral thigh tissues and the standard tensor fasciae latae territory extending down the lateral thigh. These experimental data strongly indicated that the clinical application would be successful. The flap is composed mostly of fat from the prominence of the upper lateral thigh (\"saddlebags\") based on a small plug of underlying tensor fasciae latae muscle. The amount of skin that can be included with this flap is limited in a vertical dimension to about 6 to 8 cm but is determined by the ability to close the defect. We have performed 17 flaps in 11 patients with up to 18 months of follow-up. Ten were delayed and 7 were immediate reconstructions. The chest and hip dissections are performed simultaneously by two microsurgeons. There has been one flap loss due to arterial disruption on day 3. An early problem was seroma formation in the donor site, which has been improved in the later patients by closing the dead space with sutures. The lateral transverse thigh free flap has the following advantages over other methods of autogenous-tissue breast reconstruction: (1) longer, more peripherally placed vessels, (2) easier flap dissection and no need to turn the patient during the procedure, (3) decreased postoperative morbidity and more rapid recovery, (4) reduction of an area of excess fat in those patients in whom the hips are more prominent than the abdomen, (5) greater intrinsic internal projection of the flap, and (6) excellent vascularity. The disadvantages of the flap are (1) microsurgery is required, (2) the amount of skin available is not as great as that with the gluteal or transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap, (3) the scar on the upper lateral thigh is probably more visible than on the buttock or the abdomen, and (4) a balancing procedure on the opposite hip is usually necessary in unilateral cases. Our current indications for the lateral transverse thigh free flap are (1) the transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap is unavailable, (2) for a particular breast size, the thigh fat proportions are greater than the abdominal proportions, or (3) the patient prefers this option to the transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous or gluteus flap. Results and complications with the lateral transverse thigh free flap will be presented along with pertinent comparisons with the other choices for autogenous-tissue breast reconstruction.\r"

Biopsies of the healed fracture sites were obtained in 10 consecutive patients who underwent secondary reconstructive procedures to correct residual deformities. Clinical assessment confirmed that the fractures were completely healed and stable. Histologic sections were obtained across the healed fracture sites, sent for H&E staining, and then examined by light microscopy. All specimens showed that the defects between the segments were obliterated by the formation of a mature compact bone. This bridging bone was characterized by concentric lamellae surrounded by a typical bony architecture. From this study it can be concluded that fractures of the midface heal by direct bony union.\r"

Highly comminuted fractures were accompanied by dramatic instability and marked alterations in facial architecture; only multiple surgical approaches to fully visualize the \"buttress\" system provided alignment and fixation. Classification of facial fractures by (1) anatomic location and (2) pattern of comminution and displacement define refined guidelines for exposure and fixation.\r"

  ".W": "The unique properties of the temporoparietal fascial flap (TPFF) offer adaptability in reconstruction of a variety of composite defects. The broad, thin sheet of vascularized tissue may be transferred alone or as a carrier of subjacent bone or overlying skin and scalp. As a pedicled flap, it is ideal for defects of the orbital, malar, mandibular, and mastoid regions. As a free-tissue transfer, the large vessels and lack of bulk find broad utility in reconstruction of the extremities. This flap is our choice for reconstruction of the dorsal hand and non-weight-bearing surfaces of the foot. A viscous gliding surface decreases friction for tendon excursion. The thin contour is aesthetically superior to thicker flaps, allowing unmodified footwear or gloves. The pliable fascia convolutes into surface defects (e.g., bone craters) or drapes over skeletal frameworks (e.g., ear cartilage). The rich capillary network offers nutrition to saucerized bone, cartilage or tendon grafts, and overlying skin grafts. The geometry of the skull lends to fabrication of membranous bone for complex facial puzzles. The donor site is well disguised by hair growth. Twelve cases performed over a 2-year period demonstrate the versatility of this flap. These include complex foot reconstruction, ear and scalp avulsion, shotgun wound of the cheek and orbit, posttraumatic jaw recontouring, chronic osteomyelitis of the hand and foot, and acute resurfacing of dorsal hand with tendon reconstruction.\r"

These allografts, approximately 1 mm in diameter and ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 cm in length, were rehydrated and then implanted in low-pressure and high-pressure arterial systems. Poor patency was noted in low-pressure systems in both allografts and autografts, tested in 12 rabbits. In the high-pressure arterial systems, allografts that were freeze-dried and reconstituted failed in a group of 10 rabbits with an 8-week patency rate of 30 percent. Gamma irradiation in an effort to reduce infection and antigenicity of grafts after freeze-drying was associated with a patency rate of 10 percent at 8 weeks in this system in another group of 10 rabbits. Postoperative cyclosporin A therapy was associated with a patency rate of 22.2 percent in the high-pressure arterial system in a 9-rabbit group. Control autografts in this system in a group of 10 rabbits showed a 100 percent patency at 8 weeks. Microarterial grafts depend on perfusion pressure of the vascular bed for long-term patency. Rehydrated freeze-dried microarterial allografts do not seem to function well in lengths of 1 to 2.5 cm when implanted in a high-pressure arterial system. Freeze-dried arterial allografts are probably not antigenic.\r"

However, this leaves the patient with a deficit. We have therefore begun using the fasciocutaneous flap as an initial approach to this problem. In seven patients, aged 28 to 74 years, fasciocutaneous flaps have been the reconstructive procedure of choice for repair of exposed knee joints. One patient with a very large open wound required a concomitant medial gastrocnemius muscle flap. One minor wound separation occurred in a paraplegic patient with severe spasm. No other complications occurred. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 12 months, with good success in wound closure. An approach to small and intermediate wounds is presented in which the V-Y technique is used to obviate the need for skin grafting of the donor site.\r"

This flap was used in head and neck reconstruction in 25 patients, soft-tissue cover of an extremity in 9 patients, and as a new technique for penile reconstruction in 1 patient. Osteocutaneous flaps were used for mandibular reconstruction in 13 patients. In 6 patients innervated flaps were used to provide sensation on the dorsum of the hand or on the weight-bearing surface of the foot. There was only one total flap failure and no partial failures. Recipient-site complications were few, with prompt healing and very acceptable appearance. Donor-site complications included partial loss of the skin graft with tendon exposure in 10 patients (33 percent), an unsatisfactory appearance in 5 patients (17 percent), and one case of radial fracture (8 percent). On functional testing, there was no significant loss of strength or joint mobility in the donor extremity in 19/20 patients. The authors recommend measures to reduce donor-site morbidity and conclude that, with an acceptable donor site, this flap is valuable in a variety of reconstructive applications.\r"

Forty preserved human cadaveric radii were randomized into osteotomized (20) and nonosteotomized (20) groups. Osteotomized bones were further randomized into beveled-corner (10) and squared-corner (10) groups. A 9-cm-long, one-third thickness segment of bone was removed, similar to the defect resulting from a radial osteocutaneous transfer. All bones were tested to breaking using a four-point bending apparatus. Osteotomized radii were significantly weakened, with breaking strengths only 24 percent of the control group. Although the beveled osteotomy group appeared stronger than the squared osteotomy group, this finding was not significant with the numbers tested. In view of the weakness of the osteotomized radius, we recommend excising no more than one-third of the radial diameter and postoperative immobilization of the forearm for 8 weeks. A beveled osteotomy prevents overcutting at the corners and allows better visualization of the depth of cut. With these measures, the incidence of fracture may be reduced.\r"

Longitudinal growth of the tibia and growth plate morphology were compared after transplantation between isochronografts (juvenile-to-juvenile and adult-to-adult), heterochronografts (juvenile-to-adult), and unoperated limbs. Four animals comprised each experimental group, except for the juvenile-to-adult heterochronograft group, which had six animals. Limbs were measured at 2-week intervals until sacrifice at 7 weeks. All transplanted limbs demonstrated significant longitudinal growth with maintenance of growth plate morphology and columnar organization. Despite being subjected to an adult hormonal environment, the juvenile tibias transplanted into adult hosts grew 12.0 +/- 1 mm--not significantly different from the unoperated juvenile controls, which grew 12.2 +/- 1 mm. Adult isochronografts showed continued growth of 3.1 mm, which was not significantly different from the unoperated control. Juvenile isochronografts demonstrated decreased growth when compared to unoperated limbs. Maintenance of growth in juvenile limbs transplanted to adults suggests a permissive effect of the hormonal milieu and that ultimate skeletal length is primarily determined by factors inherent in each physis. The use of vascularized transplantation of limbs in syngeneic animals of different ages offers a unique method of altering the hormonal and maturational milieu of the growth plate.\r"

Thirty-three of the 52 patients with reciprocal ST-segment depression had a significant stenosis of the coronary artery supplying the reciprocal ST-segment territory (63 per cent), and 31 of the 46 patients with a positive exercise test had a significant stenosis of the coronary artery supplying the ischaemic territory (67 per cent). Forty-one of the patients with reciprocal ST-segment depression (79 per cent) and 35 of the patients with positive exercise tests (76 per cent) were found to have multivessel coronary artery disease. The study showed that reciprocal ST-segment depression was associated with stenosis of the coronary artery supplying the territory opposite the infarct in nearly two-thirds of the patients and with multivessel coronary artery disease in almost four-fifths of them. Reciprocal ST-segment depression after infarction was as accurate as a positive submaximal exercise test at predicting the presence of multivessel coronary artery disease.\r"

Thirty-three per cent of patients left the intensive care unit alive and 24 per cent survived to leave hospital. Final survival was 20 per cent in medical patients (n = 49), 29 per cent in surgical patients (n = 38) and 100 per cent in obstetric patients (n = 3). Hypotension, requirement for inotropic support, oliguria and sepsis were all associated with a poorer prognosis. The mode of renal replacement therapy did not affect survival, but additional haemodialysis was required in 33 of 65 patients treated by continuous arteriovenous haemofiltration but none of 22 treated with continuous arteriovenous haemodialysis (p less than 0.001). APACHE II score was calculated for 87 patients. Mean APACHE II score was 26.1 +/- 6.9 (range 14 to 44). APACHE II score on admission predicted the likelihood of survival well. No patients with a score of more than 40 survived, compared to 40 per cent of those with scores of 10 to 19. Pre-existing organ insufficiency or immunosuppression meriting a CHE score of 5 was associated with a very poor survival (1 of 30 patients). APACHE II score is a reliable indicator of severity of illness and likelihood of survival in critically-ill patients with acute renal failure. The widespread adoption of APACHE II scoring for patients with acute renal failure requiring intensive care would facilitate medical audit and comparison of studies from various centres.\r"

Of the 1862 patients with acute renal failure requiring dialysis between 1965 and 1986 in a north Indian centre, 60, 15 and 25 per cent were related to medical, obstetrical and surgical conditions respectively. Among the medical patients, diarrhoeal diseases which caused 23 per cent of the total number of cases of acute renal failure in the period 1965 to 1974 caused only 10 per cent in 1981 to 1986. In the same period, acute renal failure due to sepsis and drugs increased while that due to copper sulphate poisoning and intravascular haemolysis showed a downward trend. Obstetrical acute renal failure declined from 22 per cent in 1965 to 1974 to 9 per cent during the period 1981 to 1986. This decline was chiefly due to a fall in cases of septic abortion, puerperal sepsis and postpartum haemorrhage. Surgical acute renal failure increased from 11 per cent during the period 1965 to 1974 to 31 per cent in the 1980s, predominantly due to an increase in patients with obstructive uropathy. Despite these favourable trends, the pattern of acute renal failure in the third world continues to be different from that in the developed countries.\r"

All sections of the classification were represented in this group of patients. Active and chronic lesions were more likely to occur among patients with Class III/IV (proliferative glomerulonephritis), than in any other category. Patients with Class III/IV biopsy were more likely to have evidence of clinical renal disease than patients in Class II (mesangial). However, almost half of the Class II patients had some evidence of renal disease, including elevated serum creatinine, as well as important non-glomerular lesions. Without biopsy they might have been thought to have proliferative lesions and been treated more aggressively. Two patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis had no clinical evidence of renal disease. Thus, at the time of biopsy results renal histological examination did not uniformly correlate with clinical renal disease.\r"

  ".W": "This study surveys the extent and severity of haematological and biochemical abnormalities which occurred in 265 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, and records the haematological changes that occur with treatment. Anaemia was present in 60 per cent of patients, more frequently in males than in females. Leucocytosis with neutrophilia occurred in 40 per cent, lymphopenia in 17 per cent and monocytopenia in 50 per cent. Platelet count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated in 52 and 80 per cent respectively. Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy were of limited diagnostic value. Ferritin and vitamin B12 levels were increased in 94 and 57 per cent of subjects respectively whilst serum and red cell folic acid were within normal limits in 83 per cent. The frequency of the important biochemical changes were hyponatraemia (43 per cent) and hypoalbuminaemia (72 per cent); alkaline phosphatase, aspartic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase levels were elevated in approximately a third of patients possibly due to unsuspected dissemination. There was a close correlation between the acid-fast bacilli in sputum and abnormal values, particularly those of body weight, haemoglobin, platelet count, white cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Failure of these indices to return to normal was invariably associated with persistent excretion of acid-fast bacilli. We have shown that haematological and biochemical abnormalities in pulmonary tuberculosis are common and may be valuable aids to diagnosis. Some haematological markers also reflect response to treatment.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and twenty-three patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection have been referred to rheumatologists at our hospitals between October 1985 and April 1989 because of musculoskeletal symptoms. Thirty-four homosexual men presented with acute, peripheral, non-erosive arthritis (mean number of four joints affected) with the knees being involved in 23. Other features developing concurrently with arthritis included psoriasis, keratoderma blenorrhagica, plantar fasciitis, urethritis, conjunctivitis and anterior uveitis. Four of five patients investigated were HLA-B27-positive; none of 15 patients tested had raised titres of rheumatoid or antinuclear factors. Various infections were associated with the onset of arthritis and two patients with a recent history of diarrhoea had serological evidence of yersinia infection. No micro-organisms were identified within the joint except for HIV itself. At the time of onset of arthritis four of these individuals had the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); 11 were not known to be HIV-positive before testing which was performed following referral for arthritis. Six patients have since developed AIDS and four have died. In 15 individuals, including those who progressed to AIDS, joint symptoms have been severe, persistent and poorly responsive to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In only five patients has the arthritis been known to resolve. Synovitis has also been seen in two women: in one of these HIV infection was thought to have been acquired through intravenous drug abuse. Other rheumatic lesions included myalgia/myositis, non-inflammatory peripheral arthritis, spinal pain, soft tissue lesions, arthralgia or myalgia of unknown cause and infective lesions including septic arthritis and bony infection due to histoplasmosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. It appears likely that HIV infection is a risk factor for the development of seronegative arthritis and other rheumatic lesions.\r"

Howell-Jolly bodies noted on peripheral blood smear led to a radionuclide spleen scan, which documented functional asplenia. This woman is the second patient in the United States with meningitis caused by a strain of S. pneumoniae moderately resistant to penicillin G (minimal inhibitory concentration, 1.0 microgram/mL). The resistant isolate displayed resistance to penicillin that was not of enzymatic origin but rather was due to an alteration of penicillin-binding proteins. This experience illustrates the importance of testing the in vitro susceptibility of the pneumococcus to penicillin G.\r"

We reviewed all cases of meningitis in an isolation-fever hospital in Salvador, Brazil, for the decade 1973-1982.

Children younger than 15 years accounted for 79% of cases, and 45% of cases were in children under 2 years. The overall case fatality rate was 33%, with 50% of these deaths occurring within 48 hours of hospitalization. Neisseria meningitidis was the etiologic agent in 32% of the cases, with a case fatality rate of 14%. Epidemics caused by N. meningitidis group C, then group A, in 1974-1978 accounted for 60% of the cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae caused 17% of cases, with a case fatality rate of 59%. Haemophilus influenzae type b, the most common cause of nonepidemic meningitis, caused 23% of all cases, with a case fatality rate of 38%. Enterobacteriaceae were the etiology in only 3.6% of patients, but the case fatality rate was 86%. Cultures were negative in 18% of cases with purulent cerebrospinal fluid. A total of 84% of H. influenzae, 40% of S. pneumoniae, 78% of Enterobacteriaceae, and 15% of N. meningitidis cases occurred in children less than 2 years of age. Case fatality rates were highest in this group. Vaccines protective for this age group are urgently needed.\r"

  ".W": "Inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents has been found to be common in various parts of the world, but there have been few studies in developing countries. In Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, the largest university Hospital in Thailand, a study was performed to estimate the appropriateness of the use of antimicrobial drugs. Each of the nine medical wards was sampled in random order, and daily surveillance of all patients over two 2-week periods identified 307 of the total 690 patients to have been prescribed an antibiotic. In only 27 of the 307 patients was the use of antibiotics entirely appropriate. The main problem was the use without evidence of infection (in 110 of the 307 patients), which we estimate would result in the loss for the hospital of approximately $40,000 (U.S.) each year on the medical wards alone. The choice of antimicrobial agents and pharmacokinetic considerations were also inappropriate. Use of expensive drugs where cheaper ones were available, however, was not frequent (71 of the 655 prescriptions). Attempts to rectify antimicrobial misutilization, based on the results of this study, can be focused specifically at improving clinical recognition of infectious disease by education. The pattern of antimicrobial use in a university teaching hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, reflects a high proportion of misuse. The need for rationalization of antimicrobial use is urgent.\r"

We pooled the Louisiana study and other population studies of HLA and leprosy. The results of the pooling show DR2 and DQwl to be associated with leprosy (relative risks, 2.65 for DR2 and 2.73 for DQwl), and these associations are highly statistically significant (P less than 1 x 10(-8) for DR2 and P = 3.6 x 10(-8) for DQwl). Further, we pooled studies of lepromatous leprosy patients vs. controls and studies of tuberculoid leprosy patients vs. controls and found that DR2 and DQwl are associated with both the lepromatous and the tuberculoid forms of leprosy and that these associations are statistically significant. We consider the associations of DR2 and DQwl in these population studies to be evidence for an HLA-associated genetic influence on susceptibility to leprosy.\r"

Two hundred eighty distinct multilocus genotypes were distinguished, and cluster analysis revealed two primary phylogenetic divisions. The population structure of encapsulated H. influenzae is clonal. Currently, most of the invasive disease worldwide is caused by serotype b strains of nine clones. Strains producing serotype c, e, and f capsules belong to single divisions and have no close genetic relationships to strains of other serotypes. Serotype a and b strains occur in both primary phylogenetic divisions, probably as a result of transfer and recombination of serotype-specific sequences of the cap region between clonal lineages. A close genetic relatedness between serotype d isolates and some strains of serotypes a and b was identified. There are strong patterns of geographic variation, on an intercontinental scale, in both the extent of genetic diversity and the clonal composition of populations of encapsulated strains. The analysis suggests that the present distribution of clones is, in part, related to patterns of racial or ethnic differentiation and historical demographic movements of the human host populations.\r"

Morphologic observations were compared with functional changes. After 6-hour preservation slight degenerative changes were found in the pulmonary artery flow surface and changes in lung tissue suggestive of increased vascular permeability and edema. During 4-hour reperfusion the changes progressed. Preservation was in general moderate. Lung tissue showed vascular congestion and slight inflammation. Localized areas of reperfusion damage could adjoin near-normal looking alveoli. Oxygenation and gas exchange, though low in the beginning of reperfusion, tended to improve during the reperfusion period. The method was concluded to afford good morphologic preservation of the graft after 6-hour storage, and moderately good morphologic and functional preservation after 4-hour reperfusion.\r"

The balloon catheter was introduced through the anterior wall of the pulmonary artery distal to the pulmonary valve. A Millar catheter with a distal high-fidelity pressure transducer was placed in the right ventricle, where the peak rate of pressure rise, dP/dT, was measured. Pulmonary artery counterpulsation significantly improved right ventricular function, increasing both dP/dT and systolic pressure. A diastolic dip in pulmonary artery pressure and a fall in the early portion of the right ventricular pressure curve were seen. Inflation of the balloon caused a second (suprasystolic) wave in that curve. Improved right ventricular function was also seen when normal pig hearts were counterpulsated after occlusion of the right coronary artery and following increased afterload due to occlusion of a main pulmonary artery. There were no changes in central venous or systemic pressure. The results indicate that pulmonary artery counterpulsation may be valuable when the transplanted heart has a poorly functioning right ventricle.\r"

There was no perioperative mortality. Of the six late deaths, three were due to non-cardiac causes. During follow-up (median 6, range 2-21 years), six reoperations were performed for residual or recurrent obstruction and/or aortic incompetence. Aortic valve replacement was required at two primary and four second operations.

At follow-up evaluation two patients had significant aortic regurgitation and all survivors had a systolic ejection murmur. At Doppler echocardiography in 29 patients without reoperation, the median pressure difference in the left ventricular outflow tract was 10 (range 0-55) mmHg--in three cases greater than or equal to 30 mmHg. Careful follow-up is advisable after resection of fixed subaortic stenosis, because of the risk of residual or recurrent obstruction and of significant aortic valve incompetence.\r"

Subvalvular stenosis was treated with resection of muscle (4), membrane (2) or both (2), and all six supravalvular lesions with patch aortoplasty. One death occurred during primary operation. Follow-up averaged 11.5 years. Of the 12 valvotomized patients, five required valve replacement after on average 10.6 years because of restenosis. Aortic regurgitation developed in six of the seven surviving patients treated for subvalvular stenosis, requiring reoperation in four. No mortality was associated with reoperation. All patients without valve replacement were reinvestigated. Of the seven with valvotomy, four had restenosis and three valves were in good condition. In supravalvular stenosis the gradients were low. Valvotomy and subvalvular resection can give effective palliation of aortic stenosis until the patient is old enough for definitive repair.\r"

At aneurysmal repair, closure of secundum-type atrial septal defect was performed in one case and insertion of a St Jude Medical aortic valve in another. There were no perioperative deaths. Five patients were asymptomatic in the follow-up period (5 months-17 years). One patient died of cardiomyopathy 11 years postoperatively. The long-term results after surgical repair of ruptured aortic sinus of Valsalva aneurysm thus were good, and early operation is recommended in order to avoid congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular aneurysm was surgically treated in 205 patients during the decade 1975-1984. The patients had had one to five myocardial infarctions, the latest days to years (mean 32 months) preoperatively and 92% were in NYHA functional class III or IV. The main indications for surgery were angina (47%), congestive heart failure (38%) and arrhythmia (15%). The 176 anterior, 23 posterior and six combined aneurysms were treated with resection (130 cases) or plication (75). The early mortality was 5%. Univariate analysis identified arrhythmia, concomitant valve replacement and need for intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) as significant risk factors, and multivariate analysis revealed the indication for surgery and need for IABP as the only independent predictors of total mortality. The survival rates 5 and 10 years postoperatively were respectively, 74% and 60%. At follow-up after 1/2-10 years, almost 90% of the surviving patients had improved functional status. Left ventricular aneurysm thus can be surgically treated with low mortality rate and good functional result.\r"

The central hemodynamic and graft flow (electromagnetic flow determination) responses were studied after 5-min, and in nine patients also after 30-min infusion. The low-dose adenosine infusion had little effect on the central hemodynamic parameters, while the graft flow increased in all patients (mean 84 +/- 12%, total 22 grafts). The adenosine-induced increase in graft flow was maintained when the infusion was prolonged. It is concluded that adenosine can produce marked coronary vasodilation in man at infusion rates that exert only minor systemic hemodynamic effects.\r"

Extracorporeal circulation with bicaval cannulation was used in all cases, and single-dose cardioplegic solution was injected into the aortic root. In one of two randomly selected groups (n = 27) the cardioplegic solution was allowed to pass through the lungs and then evacuated via a left ventricular vent. In a second group (n = 28) the vent was first temporarily placed in the right atrium for evacuation of the cardioplegic solution, and the aortic root was vented later. Hemodynamic, metabolic, hematologic and radiographic changes were studied during the early postoperative period. No harmful effects of the pulmonary passage could be demonstrated. On the contrary, a protective effect was indicated, as the pulmonary vascular resistance index was reduced immediately and for 2 hours postoperatively. The ratio of left ventricular to right ventricular stroke work in the early postoperative period gave the same indication.\r"

The patients were coupled to a respirator with FiO2 30 v/v %. Central haemodynamics, intrapulmonary shunt and blood gases showed no significant change in either group during the 2-hour study period. The thromboxane A2 metabolite P-TXB2 decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) in the indomethacin group, but the prostacyclin metabolite P-6-K PGF1 alpha showed no significant change in either group. The PtcO2 index (transcutaneous oxygen tension/arterial PO2), measured in the upper extremity, rose (p less than 0.05) after indomethacin infusion, but was almost unchanged in the controls. The mean subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension and the laser-Doppler skin red-cell flux underwent no significant change. The data thus suggested that indomethacin administered intravenously post-CABG may exert beneficial effects on peripheral tissue perfusion and oxygenation, possibly mediated by improvements in prostacyclin-thromboxane balance and microcirculation.\r"

In a study of 285 patients followed up for a mean of 2.5 years after mechanical heart valve replacement, one-third were sometimes disturbed by sounds emanating from the prosthesis. Older patients were less disturbed than young ones, but whether this could be explained by age-related impairment of hearing ability (presbyacusis) was not possible to determine. Prosthetic size, implantation site, patient's weight, body surface area and type of prosthesis did not statistically differ according to experience of prosthetic sounds. Although few patients were seriously disturbed by these sounds, it is hoped that mechanical heart valves of the future will function more quietly.\r"

Heart weight index (HWI) at autopsy averaged 356 +/- 94 g/m2 and left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) 19 +/- 4 mm. Macroscopic scattered streaky fibrosis (SSF) of the left ventricle was absent in 10% of the cases, slight in 31% and moderate/severe in 59%. Circumscript fibrotic scars were found in 31% and moderate/severe coronary artery disease (CAD) in 33%. All hearts were enlarged (HWI greater than 200 g/m2), primarily due to residual left ventricular hypertrophy (LVWT greater than 14 mm), which was present in 86% of cases. Both SSF and circumscript scars were unrelated to CAD. The preoperative predictability of autopsy findings was studied with multiple regression analyses. Predictive factors were as follows. For high HWI: high left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, short operation-autopsy time (O-A time) and high ECG hypertrophy score (ECG-hyp). For high LWT value: high cardiothoracic index (CTI), high transvalvular peak-systolic gradient and NYHA class II-III (vs. class IV). For moderate/severe SSF: high CTI and left ventricular failure. For moderate/severe CAD: short O-A time, narrow pulse pressure and low ECG-hyp. Although separated by valve replacement and a time span of up to 14 years, cardiac pathology at autopsy and preoperative patient/heart status were closely interrelated, thus emphasizing the significance of preoperatively impaired cardiac functional status and its relation to irreversible myocardial damage. The results advocate early operative intervention in aortic stenosis.\r"

The solitary plasmacytoma was treated with incisional biopsy and radiotherapy. Two of the three patients with radical excision of sternal chondrosarcoma were alive after 5 years. Careful preoperative assessment, including use of computed tomography, is important. Wide excision should be the procedure of choice for all sternal tumours, since differentiation between benign and malignant lesions may be difficult in cartilaginous tumours, which are the commonest types.\r"

The simplest version of the model provides a broad-band estimate of the smallest applied electric field to which membrane macromolecules can directly respond (about 10(-3) volt per centimeter). Much smaller fields (10(-6) volt per centimeter) can be detected if there is a response in only a narrow band of frequencies or if signal averaging occurs through field-induced variation in the catalytic activity of membrane-associated enzymes. Both extensions of the simplest version remove the apparent violation of the thermal noise limit found in some experiments.\r"

The health sector's share of the gross national product rose from well under 5 percent in the late 1940s to more than 11 percent in the late 1980s. The expenditures gap has two components: health care prices rose 1.6 percent per annum more rapidly than other prices, while the quantity of health care grew 0.9 percent per annum faster than other quantities. Many factors, including wages, productivity, technology, and insurance contributed to these trends. No single explanation suffices, and no simple solution is apparent.\r"

The same slope is found for various classes of compounds, whereas the intercept depends on the particular class. The feature common to these processes is exposure of hydrophobic groups to water. These observations make possible the assignment of the heat capacity change to hydrophobic solvation and lead to the description of protein stability in terms of a hydrophobic and a nonhydrophobic contribution. A general representation of protein stability is given by the heat capacity change and the temperature.\r"

When first treated with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), none (0/17) were HIV-positive by this assay. However, AZT-treated SCID-hu mice did have a few infected cells; after AZT treatment was stopped, viral spread was detected by polymerase chain reaction in such mice.

To determine the relevance of chromosome 6 abnormalities in melanoma, a normal chromosome 6 was directly introduced into melanoma cell lines. The resulting (+6) microcell hybrids were significantly altered in their phenotypic properties in culture and lost their ability to form tumors in nude mice. The loss of the chromosome 6 from melanoma microcell hybrids resulted in the reversion to tumorigenicity of these cells in mice. The introduction of the selectable marker (psv2neo) alone into melanoma cell lines had no effect on tumorigenicity. These results support the idea that one or more genes on chromosome 6 may control the malignant expression of human melanoma.\r"

Most such hybrids exhibited a limited life span comparable to that of the human fibroblasts, indicating that cellular senescence is dominant in these hybrids. Karyotypic analyses of the hybrid clones that did not senesce revealed that all these clones had lost both copies of human chromosome 1, whereas all other human chromosomes were observed in at least some of the immortal hybrids. The application of selective pressure for retention of human chromosome 1 to the cell hybrids resulted in an increased percentage of hybrids that senesced. Further, the introduction of a single copy of human chromosome 1 to the hamster cells by microcell fusion caused typical signs of cellular senescence. Transfer of chromosome 11 had no effect on the growth of the cells. These findings indicate that human chromosome 1 may participate in the control of cellular senescence and further support a genetic basis for cellular senescence.\r"

  ".W": "Introduction of a normal retinoblastoma gene (RB) into retinoblastoma cells was previously shown to suppress several aspects of their neoplastic phenotype, including tumorigenicity in nude mice, thereby directly demonstrating a cancer suppression function of RB. To explore the possibility of a similar activity in a common adult tumor, RB expression was examined in three human prostate carcinoma cell lines. One of these, DU145, contained an abnormally small protein translated from an RB messenger RNA transcript that lacked 105 nucleotides encoded by exon 21. To assess the functional consequences of this mutation, normal RB expression was restored in DU145 cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Cells that maintained stable exogenous RB expression lost their ability to form tumors in nude mice, although their growth rate in culture was apparently unaltered. These results suggest that RB inactivation can play a significant role in the genesis of a common adult neoplasm and that restoration of normal RB-encoded protein in tumors could have clinical utility.\r"

E19 blocked the presentation of vaccinia and influenza virus proteins to CTLs in a MHC class I allele-specific manner identical to its inhibition of MHC class I transport from the endoplasmic reticulum. This finding indicates that (i) the relevant parameter for antigen presentation is the rate of MHC class I molecule exocytosis, not the level of class I cell surface expression, and (ii) association of class I molecules with antigen is likely to occur within the endoplasmic reticulum.\r"

Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) are assumed to have one or more populations of diving T cells that are being stimulated by autoantigens. Mutant T cell clones from MS patients were isolated and tested for reactivity to myelin basic protein, an antigen that is thought to participate in the induction of the disease. The hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hprt) clonal assay was used to determine mutant frequency values in MS patients with chronic progressive disease. Eleven of 258 thioguanine-resistant (hprt-) T cell clones from five of the six MS patients who were tested proliferated in response to human myelin basic protein without prior in vitro exposure to this antigen. No wild-type clones from these patients, nor any hprt- or wild-type clones from three healthy individuals responded to myelin basic protein. Thus, T cell clones that react with myelin basic protein can be isolated from the peripheral blood of MS patients.\r"

However, visual search also has access to another level of representation, one that describes properties in the corresponding three-dimensional scene. Among these properties are three dimensionality and the direction of lighting, but not viewing direction. These findings imply that the parallel processes of early vision are much more sophisticated than previously assumed.\r"

Responses were analyzed and combined with sick leave data to determine the use of sick leave among employees who currently smoke, those who never smoked, and those who formerly smoked. Current smokers took significantly more sick leave than those who have never smoked (\"nonsmokers\") or former smokers. Using an analysis of variance model, only smoking status, education level, and sex, among selected demographic variables, were significantly related to the amount of sick leave taken. Current smokers took excess sick leave (amounting to nearly $40,000) as compared with nonsmokers and ex-smokers combined over a 21-month period. This study also characterizes the relationship between smoking status and selected life-style behavior. Smokers were less active, less likely to use seat belts, less likely to believe that smoking is related to health, and more likely to be heavier and to eat a poor diet than their nonsmoking or former smoking counterparts. We make suggestions regarding the reduction of smoking and other deleterious behavior as a means of controlling costs and reducing employee morbidity.\r"

No risk factor for HIV infection was identified in 30% of cases. Documentation of patients' consent for testing was found in 14% of cases. We conclude that HIV antibody testing of hospitalized patients has increased. However, the indication for testing is often not clear by chart review, and consent for testing is poorly documented in the absence of a formal hospital policy requiring consent before testing. Further physician education and establishment of hospital policies addressing these important aspects of HIV antibody testing are indicated.\r"

Complete excision was documented in ten patients, and one patient had small artifacts that resolved on follow-up studies. Roentgenograms of the surgical specimen from ten patients showed a discrete lesion in only three. Histologic analysis revealed malignancy in two patients and benign changes in nine. These findings indicate that mammography done immediately after excision of occult noncalcified lesions is more reliable than roentgenograms of the specimen and may be a useful method for confirming extent of excision. This method may also eliminate the present delay of four to six weeks before adequate postoperative follow-up films can be obtained to evaluate excision.\r"

We reviewed these cases retrospectively to determine the types and frequency of complications requiring catheter removal. The catheters were in place a total of 18,397 days. Overall, 14% (7/51) of SL and 21% (20/94) of DL catheters were removed due to infection. Of those catheters becoming infected, DL catheters were infected earlier. SL catheters that became infected averaged 213 days of use before removal, whereas DL catheters becoming infected averaged only 78 days before removal (P less than or equal to .02). The infection rate was significantly less in SL (one infection per 1,210 days) than in DL catheters (one infection per 496 days) (P less than or equal to .02). Thus because of its significantly reduced risk of infection, the single-lumen Hickman may be the preferred catheter for long-term venous access in many patients.\r"

A new recording device, the continuous cardiac loop ECG recorder, affords prolonged ambulatory monitoring and can capture the rhythm at the time of syncope. To determine the impact of cardiac loop ECG recorders in diagnosing syncope, we reviewed the records of the first 48 patients referred for cardiac loop recording because of unexplained syncope or presyncope. Previous cardiac studies were nondiagnostic in all patients. In 36% of these patients, loop recording definitively determined whether an arrhythmia was the cause of symptoms. Median duration of monitoring was 28 days, with an average charge of $180 per month. Cardiac loop ECG recording is a convenient, safe, inexpensive, and potentially highly effective means of diagnosing unexplained syncope.\r"

Aortocaval compression may lead to uteroplacental insufficiency, supine hypotension, and potentially cardiopulmonary arrest. In addition, aortocaval compression is associated with placental abruption. This report presents three cases that illustrate the tragic outcomes of transporting pregnant women in the supine position. Pregnant women should be transported in a position of lateral tilt.\r"

The passive theory is that progression is prevented by the forces exerted by the brace. The active theory is that progression is prevented by muscle contractions that arise in response to wearing the brace. This study examined the active theory of brace correction. Trunk muscle myoelectric activities were measured in ten adolescent females with right thoracic idiopathic scoliosis being treated with Boston braces. Activities were both measured when wearing and when not wearing their braces. Differences in braced and unbraced myoelectric activities were seldom statistically significant and never biomechanically significant. Boston brace effectiveness seems not to result from active responses to brace wearing.\r"

In Section 3, ten single-stage and ten two-stage spinal surgery cases using both cell saver and autologous predeposited blood were investigated. With this program, 90% of the single-stage patients did not require additional homologous blood, while 80% of the two-stage patients did. In Section 4, 65 patients undergoing six general types of spinal surgery were examined to determine the number of predeposited autologous units needed to avoid homologous blood during hospitalization. Guidelines for determining optimal donation were developed assuming the use of intraoperative cell saver use.\r"

Diagnoses included 17 patients with cerebral palsy, six with spinal bifida, and 11 with other diseases (spinal muscular atrophy, Friedreich's ataxia, polyneuropathy, nemaline myopathy, and polio). Twenty-three patients had single uncompensated thoracolumbar curves, and 11 had a double curve pattern. The mean preoperative major curve was 66 degrees (range, 22-132 degrees), the secondary curve 58 degrees (range, 23-84 degrees). No postoperative spinal support was used. Mean curve correction was 36 degrees or 54.6%. There were four major complications, including two implant failures requiring revision and two patients sustaining excessive intraoperative blood loss necessitating completion of the procedure in a second stage. There were two neurologic complications including one case of postoperative seizures and an L4 monoradicular neuropathy in a spina bifida patient. Four patients had temporary postoperative ileus, one gastroesophageal reflex, and four had urinary tract infections. There were no significant postoperative pulmonary complications. Excluding the patients with rod failure, mean loss of correction at mean follow-up of 21.3 months was 6.5%. The stability and curve correction obtained using this system supports its continued use in patients with progressive neuromuscular scoliosis.\r"

In the early stage of paralysis, the degenerated posterior funiculus originated from a small hemorrhagic area in the posterior column of the involved cord. Using the scanning electron microscope, the hemorrhage was found to be from the intrinsic vein, resulting from the disturbance of venous drainage in the compressed portion. In the early stage of compression, extravasation of horseradish peroxidase was observed in the white matter, but histologic degeneration was not. A hemorrhage existed wherever degeneration of the funiculus was observed. Therefore, the trigger to induce the initial damage on the cord in spinal metastasis was not likely to be vasogenic edema, but instead the intrinsic venous hemorrhage.\r"

The neural tissues were compressed in two cases and transected in one. The Denis A fractures had relatively well-restored ligamentous structures and the bone fragment in the spinal canal was narrowing the spinal canal less than 50% in all cases. Three of four had normal neural tissue macroscopically and microscopically. The majority of the patients with chronic burst fractures did not show any sign of bone fragment resorption. Six out of eight patients with thoracolumbar (T12 and L1) and lumbar (L3) fractures experienced intractable burning pain and/or rhizopathy. The pain seemed to be caused by entrapment of the nerve roots in adhesions.\r"

Pain and functional disability tended to remain the same as at the time of diagnosis, although severity of symptoms fluctuated. Increased neurologic deficits were more frequently due to surgical intervention than to the natural course of the disease. Urinary symptoms characterized by urgency, frequency, and occasional incontinence, with no other apparent cause, developed late in 23%. Although the majority were able to walk and drive a car without limitation, ability to return to previous full-time occupations was markedly limited. The majority depended on daily narcotic analgesics; a few admitted to alcohol abuse. There were two deaths by suicide. Although other deaths were not directly related to arachnoiditis, the average lifespan was shortened by 12 years. Treatment results were disappointing. Arachnoiditis may be disabling; however, longterm follow-up indicates that progression of symptoms and functional impairment are not the natural course of the disease.\r"

The patients who showed healing had an average preoperative duration of symptoms of 17 months (mean, 12 months). The five patients whose radiographs showed persistent defects postoperatively were found to have had preoperative symptoms for an average of 47 months (mean, 48 months). This significantly greater (P 0.05) duration of symptoms prior to stabilization was the only variable that proved to be statistically significant. Controversy continues to exist as to the etiology of spondylolysis; however, the ability to heal the defect with lumbar spinal stability certainly supports the theory that the defect is a result of fatigue stresses, which finally manifest as a fracture seen on radiographs as the spondylolytic defect. Posterior spinal stabilization in those patients with symptoms for a period of less than 2 years who have failed conservative management can be expected to heal the pars defects.\r"

Such vertebrae were observed in 140 of 2,000 adults with back pain over a 4-year period of study. Each patient had radiographic evaluation of the lumbar spine by plain films as well as a sectional imaging modality (magnetic resonance [MR] or computed tomography [CT]). The overall incidence of structural pathology (eg, spinal stenosis and disc protrusion) detected by CT or MR was not apparently higher in patients with transitional vertebrae, but the distribution of these lesions was significantly different. Disc bulge or herniation, when it occurred, was nearly nine times more common at the interspace immediately above the transitional vertebra than at any other level. Spinal stenosis and nerve root canal stenosis were more common at or near the interspace above the transitional vertebra than at any other level. Degenerative change at the articulation between the transverse process of the transitional vertebra and the pelvis was an uncommon occurrence; when seen there was no significant correlation with the reported side of pain. It is postulated that hypermobility and altered stresses become concentrated in the spine at the level immediately above a lumbar transitional vertebra. Accelerated disc and facet joint degeneration at this level may then result.\r"

Severity of pain was graded and localized over radiographic deformities in the coronal and sagittal planes. Radiographic changes in primary as well as full and fractional compensatory curves were studied. Degrees of scoliosis, percent correction on side bending, vertebral body rotation at curve apex, spinal balance, and lateral olisthesis in the coronal plane, degenerative disc disease, and other degenerative changes in all curves were measured and graded in both the coronal and sagittal planes. Lordosis and kyphosis were measured on all standing sagittal radiographs. Forty-one patients had pulmonary function studies. Multiple variable statistical analysis (Spearman correlation coefficients) of the data found fractional lumbosacral curves most painful and disabling. Scoliosis greater than 40 degrees and kyphosis greater than 50 degrees correlated with increasing pain and decreasing forced vital capacity. Reduction in forced vital capacity also correlated with curve rigidity. Rotation correlated closely with degrees of scoliosis (r = 0.70; P less than 0.0001) and had the highest correlation with pain (r = 0.59; P less than 0.0001) of all radiographic findings and deformities studied.\r"

  ".W": "Five different spinal implants, all using pedicle screw attachment to vertebrae, were examined in a one above/one below corpectomy model, to determine 1) the relative stiffness of each construct, 2) the stresses generated in the implant during loading, and 3) the relative fatigue susceptibility of each implant. Results indicated that the relative axial and torsional stiffnesses were similar for all the implants tested (DKS/Zielke, VSP/Steffee, AO Fixator Interne, Luque plate, AO Notched plate). Hence, each of the devices impart approximately the same stability to the spine in this highly unstable model. Stresses measured at the root of the pedicle screws were found to exceed the endurance limit of stainless steel in those systems in which the pedicle screws were attached rigidly to the plates (VSP/Steffee, AO Fixator Interne). Good agreement was found between the measured stresses and stresses derived from static calculations. Comparisons between the stresses from each implant gave a relative measure of fatigue susceptibility that was validated by in vitro cyclic testing. Implants with stresses exceeding the endurance limit failed during the cyclic test.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertonic saline solution (HTS) treatment of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock (UCHS) induced by incision of three major branches of the ileocolic artery, leading to free intra-abdominal bleeding, was studied in rats. The rats were divided into two groups. In group 1, the abdominal wall was closed immediately after induction of hemorrhage and the rats were divided into six subgroups--1a, five untreated; 1b, 14 treated with 5 milliliters per kilogram of sodium chloride 7.5 per cent (HTS) after five minutes; 1c, eight had HTS infused after 15 minutes; 1d, nine had HTS infused after 30 minutes; 1e, nine had HTS infused after 60 minutes, and 1f, nine had HTS infused after 120 minutes. In rats in group 2, the abdominal wall was kept open during HTS therapy and bleeding was estimated by the amount of sponges used to absorb shed blood. These rats were also divided into six subgroups--2a, five untreated; 2b, nine had HTS infused after five minutes; 2c, six had HTS infused after 15 minutes; 2d, six had HTS infused after 30 minutes; 2e, eight had HTS infused after 60 minutes, and 2f, six had HTS infused after 120 minutes. UCHS in group 1 was followed by a fall in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 99 to 46 torr (p less than 0.001) in five minutes and a gradual rise to 63 torr (p less than 0.01) after 30 minutes, with a survival rate of 80 per cent. HTS infusion five minutes after hemorrhage was followed by a further fall in MAP to 37 torr (p less than 0.01) after 30 minutes and a mortality rate of 85.7 per cent (p less than 0.01). HTS treatment after 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes also led to a further fall in MAP and increased mortality. In group 2, the hemodynamic response to intra-abdominal vessel injury in untreated rats was similar to that of those in group 1 and the amount of sponges used to absorb shed blood was 2.4. After five, 60 and 120 minutes of HTS treatment, the hemodynamic response was similar to that in group 1. Five and one-half (p less than 0.01), 3.5 and 3.0 sponges, respectively, were used to absorb shed blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

At the Johns Hopkins Hospital during the past two years, 78 traumatic injuries were evaluated angiographically in 70 consecutive patients, including 63 men and seven women, ranging in age from five to 78 years (mean of 26.5 years). There were 63 gunshot, five stab, three shotgun and seven blunt injuries. Fifty-two involved the lower extremity; 21, the upper extremity; two, the buttock; two, the neck, and one, the pelvic region. Indications for study included proximal injury in 59, abnormal pulse examination in six, expanding hematoma in four, neurologic abnormality in six and bleeding and hypotension in three. Arterial abnormalities were documented in 11 of these injuries, including five of injuries with an abnormal pulse, two with bleeding and hypotension, two with an expanding hematoma, one with a neurologic deficit and one of proximal injuries. There were no false-positive arteriograms. The results of this study demonstrate that exclusion angiography is safe and accurate, but probably overused in the patient with proximal injury in the absence of other clinical signs.\r"

Ages ranged from 17 to 80 years (mean of 56 years). Abdominal or flank pain was the presenting symptom in 13 patients; one patient was in a state of shock. Anemia and elevation of lactate dehydrogenase were uniformly present during acute evaluation. Computerized tomography (CT) identified lesions other than hematoma in ten of 14 instances. Arteriography was essential to the diagnosis of two vascular lesions not appreciated by other imaging modalities. Intravenous pyelography and ultrasound did not add significantly to findings on CT or arteriography. Six patients underwent serial CT evaluation; three with persistent nonfatty lesions had carcinoma of the kidney confirmed at operation. Carcinoma of the kidney occurred in a total of eight patients and angiomyolipoma in three patients. It was suggested that patients with clinical evidence for spontaneous perirenal hemorrhage should be evaluated by CT, with arteriography added when the underlying cause remains uncertain. Nephrectomy should be performed for CT evidence of nonfatty lesions other than hematoma. Other patients may have serial CT with nephrectomy reserved for persistent abnormalities. The protocol decreases the likelihood of nephrectomy for benign disease while addressing the high incidence of carcinoma of the kidney among patients with spontaneous perirenal hemorrhage.\r"

The advantage of local anesthesia is that neurologic function can be continuously assessed while the carotid arteries are cross-clamped, and unnecessary shunting can, thus, be avoided, with resulting sedation, analgesia, alpha blockade and blood pressure stability. The main objection to the use of local anesthesia is the anxiety of the patient. We overcame this difficulty in a series of 42 patients by supplementing the local anesthetic with neuroleptic analgesia. The possible disadvantages of neuroleptic administration are apnea and prolonged sedation. Only one of the patients we studied required an intraluminal shunt. One patient died of cardiac disease and one suffered an early postoperative stroke, which subsequently resolved. We believe that local anesthesia, supplemented by neuroleptic sedation and analgesia to overcome patient anxiety, should be more widely used for carotid endarterectomy.\r"

Between January 1984 and December 1987, 266 women underwent 279 needle-localized biopsies of the breast performed at a large community teaching hospital. The majority of the women (221 of 266) were found to have benign disease of the breast and 162 of 221 of these were considered to have no increased risk of future carcinoma of the breast as determined by pathologic criteria. Thirty-eight women had primary malignant conditions. Seven patients had recurrent carcinomas after initial treatment with segmental mastectomy. The majority of both the primary and recurrent malignant lesions were infiltrating carcinoma. Using the Fischer exact test, a significant correlation (p less than 0.0004) was found between primary infiltrating carcinoma and a soft tissue mass on mammography. A significant correlation (p less than 0.03) was also found between primary intraductal carcinoma and clustered microcalcifications on mammography. Needle-localized biopsy of the breast provides early detection of carcinoma of the breast and identification of those at risk for subsequent carcinoma of the breast.\r"

The described technique, however, provides a convenient means of reconstruction for the upper portion of the GI. tract when resection of the small intestine is necessary at the ligament of Treitz or in close proximity to the origin of the mesenteric vasculature. Thus, adequate resection at the ligament of Treitz may be performed when necessary, and the need to subsequently visualize or mobilize the transected duodenal stump to construct an anastomosis in that region is obviated.\r"

  ".U": "90141041\r", 
  ".W": "Arachidonic acid metabolites have been implicated in the development of cerebral edema following ischemia. To define the time course of metabolite production, subtemporal craniectomies were performed on 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400 g). Thirty rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion while 30 rats underwent craniectomy alone. Five rats in each of two groups (middle cerebral artery occlusion and sham) were sacrificed at 15 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 1 day, 3 days, and 6 days. The cerebral hemispheres were removed and divided in the midsagittal plane. Each hemisphere was immediately frozen in isopentane cooled in dry ice and stored at -70 degrees C. Tissue prostaglandins E2 and 6-keto F1 alpha, and leukotrienes (LT) B4 and C4 were measured by radioimmunoassay. Prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha were significantly elevated at 15 minutes in the middle cerebral artery occlusion hemispheres (p less than 0.05). Prostaglandins were not significantly elevated after 15 minutes. LT B4 and C4 were never significantly elevated. Meclofenamate, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, was administered to 21 additional rats. Seven controls underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion alone, 7 were given intraperitoneal meclofenamate (20 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion, and 7 underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion followed immediately by intraperitoneal meclofenamate (20 mg/kg). The animals were sacrificed at 15 minutes and similarly studied. There was a significant reduction of prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha following pretreatment with meclofenamate (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05). In pretreated rats, leukotrienes were not affected by meclofenamate. Similarly, prostaglandins and leukotrienes did not change when meclofenamate was administered after middle cerebral artery occlusion. We conclude that cyclo-oxygenase metabolite production begins within 15 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Treatment with meclofenamate prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion significantly reduced cyclooxygenase metabolite production, suggesting a protective effect of meclofenamate against ischemia-induced elevations of vasoactive prostaglandins implicated in the development of cerebral edema. Lipoxygenase metabolite production was not affected by middle cerebral artery occlusion or pharmacological intervention.\r"

Recent, long-term follow-up was also conducted. The pan-angiography was technically adequate and did not show vasospasm, both being causes of aneurysmal nonvisualization. No etiology was demonstrated on repeat study in all 24 patients. An additional three patients had only one study, but autopsy later confirmed lack of etiology for subarachnoid hemorrhage despite gross and microscopic serial sections. The mean duration of follow-up was 18.1 years and outcome was favorable. Our results suggest that repeat cerebral pan-angiography may not be indicated in the patient who has no further bleeding episodes and in whom the initial study was normal, technically adequate, and complete without evidence of vasospasm. Nonvisualization of a cerebral aneurysm is commonly proposed as the most likely cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage when angiography is normal following nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our results suggest this conclusion is no longer accurate if the angiogram is technically adequate with the absence of vasospasm.\r"

The fragmentation time was 21.9 +/- 52 seconds (mean +/- SEM) for ultrasound and 2.5 +/- 3.4 seconds for electrohydraulic lithotripsy. The energies required were similar to those used safely in the fragmentation of renal and bladder stones. Fragmentation was not related to the composition of the gallstones; there was no statistical difference between the fragmentation times or rates (p greater than 0.05) in cholesterol stones and pigment stones by either method. Fragmentation time was linearly related to gallstone weight for both methods. Comparison of ultrasound and electrohydraulic lithotripsy, using the two-way analysis of variance model, revealed no statistical difference between the two methods in times and rates of fragmentation (p greater than 0.05). Both ultrasound and electrohydraulic lithotripsy offer distinct advantages over the dissolution of gallstones by chemical methods because they are rapid and independent of gallstone composition. In vivo fragmentation of a large pigment common duct stone was also accomplished by means of an electrohydraulic lithotriptor. The stone was discovered in a 79-year-old patient on post-operative T-tube cholangiogram. Chemical analysis of the gallstones removed from the patient during cholecystectomy had revealed a very low cholesterol content. Since the remaining stone could not be dissolved and was too large to be mechanically extracted, it was fragmented through a T-tube, under fluoroscopic guidance and the small fragments were extracted with a dormia basket. The electrohydraulic lithotriptor was selected because it has a flexible probe.\r"

These values are significantly lower than for age-matched normal subjects. After successful parathyroid surgery, the bone mass of the distal radius and lumbar vertebrae increased by approximately 10% within 3 months after operation and then remained stable during the first postoperative year. In conclusion, parathyroid surgery is followed by a significant increase of bone mass in primary and secondary HPT. The substantial increase in bone mass in parts of the skeleton consisting predominantly of trabecular bone, as well as in sites with predominantly cortical bone, indicates that remineralization after operation involves a generalized increase in bone mass.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to identify factors in primary tumors that would predict liver metastases, we retrospectively reviewed 102 patients with gastric cancer, and their tissue blocks were restained. New staining methods for elastin and endothelium were used to identify intratumoral vessels. Blood vessel invasion, thus detected, was analyzed quantitatively, as well as qualitatively, according to the location of invasion, the size of the involved vessel, and the mode of invasion. The invasion was then compared with the presence of liver metastasis by the chi 2 test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and the Student t test. Discrimination analysis of factors significantly correlated with liver metastasis was performed with linear discrimination function to identify a predictive model for liver metastasis. Significant differences in qualitative frequency of blood vessel invasion (p less than 0.01), the number of lymph node metastases (p less than 0.05), and the depth of tumor invasion (p less than 0.05) were found in those patients in whom liver metastasis developed, as compared with 5-year disease-free survivors. Quantitative analysis of blood vessel invasion revealed eight other factors correlated with liver metastasis; frequency of blood vessel invasion in the 0.01 to 0.1 mm and 0.1 to 1 mm diameter vessels, in the forms of complete, partial tumor thrombi, and vessel wall invasion, in the submucosa and the subserosa, and the number of anatomic stomach layers involved. Application of the discrimination coefficient to these factors allows prediction of liver metastasis with 81.8% sensitivity, 85.3% specificity, and 83.6% accuracy. Liver metastasis can be predicted from the qualitative and quantitative examination of blood vessel invasion within the primary tumor by the use of an elastic fiber stain.\r"

Twenty-five (61%) of these patients died compared with an overall mortality rate of 31% (chi 2; p less than 0.001). Twenty-two of the 25 deaths were caused by blood loss. Two patterns of hepatic venous injury appeared to predominate: avulsion of the trunk of the right hepatic vein from the inferior vena cava and avulsion of the upper branch of the right hepatic vein. The trunk injury was seen in 15 patients, 12 of whom died. The branch injury was seen in 13 patients, only 4 of whom died (Fisher's exact test; p = 0.006). In what appears to be the largest series of blunt hepatic venous injuries published, the injuries have been classified according to the anatomic site of the injury. Such a classification correlates with prognosis. Differences between blunt and penetrating hepatic venous trauma have been discussed.\r"

The loops were perfused intraluminally in a random sequence with physiologic buffer, buffer containing 3.5% ethanol, and buffer containing 7% ethanol. The addition of 3.5% or 7% ethanol to the buffer reduced the net absorption of glucose by 13% and 26%, respectively. The addition of 7% but not 3.5% ethanol significantly increased the net secretion of calcium (168% of basal). In contrast, luminal perfusion with ethanol did not significantly alter intestinal handling of water, sodium, or potassium. Serum calcium and glucose levels were similarly unaffected by the ethanol perfusion. Mean serum ethanol levels were all less than 10 mg/dl. We conclude that intraluminal ethanol has a significant effect on the jejunal handling of glucose and calcium, and this effect is not dependent on systemic intoxication.\r"

For better diagnosis of allograft dysfunction, adequate tissue specimens must be obtained without trauma to the allograft. We devised a cystoscopically directed needle biopsy technique to obtain tissue from the canine pancreaticoduodenal allograft. This technique is made feasible by a duodenocystostomy similar to that in human pancreaticoduodenal transplantation. The duodenum acts as a port of entry for the biopsy instruments, providing access to the pancreas. A 24F side-viewing nephroscope is used to view the duodenum. The tissue specimen is obtained with an 18-gauge, 350 mm Menghini aspiration needle inserted by way of the nephroscope through the duodenum and into the pancreas. Pancreaticoduodenal allotransplantation with a duodenocystostomy for exocrine drainage was performed in 18 dogs. Of 59 serial biopsy specimens obtained, 41 (69.5%) were adequate for pathologic evaluation. The principal complication associated with the technique was minimal bleeding at the biopsy site, occurring in 22 of the 59 biopsy procedures. This cystoscopically directed biopsy technique appears to be safe, often obtains adequate tissue for diagnosis, and may be directly applicable for distinguishing causes of allograft dysfunction in human pancreaticoduodenal transplantation.\r"

We also sought to determine whether the plasma levels of these peptides were increased when stimulated with calcium and pentagastrin in familial medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MCT). The tumor tissue from all 17 cases examined was found to exhibit calcitonin and CGRP immunoreactivity, and in 15 of the 17 cases the tumor tissue also contained GRP immunoreactivity. In 7 of the cases selected at random, an intravenous injection of calcium carbonate (2 mg/kg body weight) and pentagastrin (0.6 microgram/kg body weight) produced marked elevation in plasma levels of calcitonin but did not significantly alter the plasma levels of CGRP or GRP. We conclude that most MCT tumors contain CGRP and GRP immunoreactive cells but that the plasma levels of CGRP and GRP are not altered on stimulation. This finding is clearly in contrast to the markedly elevated calcitonin levels. Hence, determination of plasma calcitonin levels still seems to be the most appropriate diagnostic test for MCT.\r"

Although an initial rise of enzyme concentration was documented in every patient, unrelieved biliary obstruction was associated with a gradual return of ALP to normal values. The return to normal levels coincided with the development of atrophy of that part of the liver deprived of its bile drainage. An animal model of experimental selective biliary obstruction supported a causative association between reduction of hepatocyte mass and a decrease in ALP activity. It appears that normal serum ALP levels can be expected with advanced obstructive biliary disease. Suspected lobar or segmental duct obstruction warrants investigation--even if liver function tests are normal.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-one consecutive patients (10 male and 11 female) with ulcerative colitis who underwent colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and endorectal ileal pullthrough with ileal reservoir were examined by serial anorectal sphincter measurements. Values were recorded before operation, after operation, and on two occasions during a 6-month period after ileostomy closure. Anal sphincter pressures and rectal ampullary volume measurements were performed using a new, simplified recording instrument. The anal resting pressure was elevated for both male and female patients preoperatively but decreased to levels slightly below normal control values after the pullthrough procedure. The maximal squeeze pressure was markedly elevated for both male and female patients preoperatively but decreased to levels near normal controls postoperation and remained at this level during the entire period of study. The rectal sensitivity threshold and rectal volume tolerance were markedly decreased preoperatively and appeared to correlate closely with the severity of inflammatory disease in the rectum. After the operation the maximal tolerance volume increased in direct relation with enlargement of the ileal reservoir and was associated with a slight, but definite, decrease in stool frequency. This study confirms the view that although mucosal proctectomy may have mildly adverse effects on anal sphincter function, this impairment is well compensated in most patients. Abnormalities recorded preoperatively are likely to persist after the pullthrough procedure. More than 90% of patients consider themselves continent after long-term follow-up evaluation.\r"

This was successful in 50 patients. A single endoprosthesis was inserted in each case. Both right and left hepatic duct decompression were obtained in 31 patients, but only unilateral or segmental drainage was achieved in 19 patients. Procedure-related complications occurred in 18 (36%) patients, and 15 (30%) patients died within 30 days of the procedure. Satisfactory resolution of jaundice was obtained in 26 (84%) patients with bilateral decompression and in 12 (63%) of those with unilateral drainage. The 30-day mortality rate was 26% for patients with bilateral and 37% for those with unilateral drainage. The morbidity rate from cholangitis after endoprosthesis insertion was 10% after bilateral and 32% after unilateral drainage. None of these differences was statistically significant. Surviving patients with satisfactory bile drainage were relieved of symptoms such as pruritus. The combined percutaneous-endoscopic technique enables difficult biliary strictures to be intubated. Although bilateral duct drainage is preferable, the palliation is often worthwhile even when segmental ducts alone are drained.\r"

Imaging modalities demonstrated a solitary huge tumor, initially inoperable, occupying almost the entire liver in a 4-month-old female infant. Transcatheter intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy with 10 mg doxorubicin, 20 mg cisplatin, and 3 ml Lipiodol, repeated twice at a 1-month interval, led to a remarkable reduction in tumor size and thereby made it resectable. The volume ratio between the intact hepatic parenchyma and the tumor changed from 1:1.70 to 1:0.13, as assessed by serial computed tomography scans, and the patient's initial alpha-fetoprotein level of 223,210 ng/ml declined to 53 ng/ml. The present case is the first in the literature, to our knowledge, of a resected hepatoblastoma in the caudate lobe. Clinical details of the tumor and surgical issues are discussed.\r"

Diaphragm function was initially assessed by measuring transdiaphragmatic pressure during a voluntary manoeuvre, the maximal sniff (sniff Pdi); normal readings were confirmed in the control subjects (102-157 (normal greater than 98) cm H2O in the 10 men, 79-102 (normal greater than 70) cm H2O in the 10 women) and reduced values were found in the 15 patients with diaphragm weakness (7.5-90 cm H2O in the 13 men, 23 and 53 cm H2O in the two women). Twitch Pdi during bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation ranged from 8.8 to 33 cm H2O in the control subjects and from 3.1 to 27 cm H2O in the 10 patients in whom a measurement could be obtained. Bilateral twitch Pdi correlated with sniff Pdi both in the control subjects and in the patients with diaphragm weakness (r = 0.75). Only four patients had a bilateral twitch Pdi below the lowest value seen in the control group, including the three with the lowest sniff Pdi (3.1-8.5 cm H2O). These results indicate that transdiaphragmatic pressure recorded during bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation discriminated between control subjects and patients with known weakness of the diaphragm only when this was severe.\r"

Recurrent, often profound, hypoxaemia has been shown in a previous study by this group to occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in these patients before they develop sleep symptoms. In this study the efficacy and physiological effects of nocturnal oxygen in such patients have been assessed. Seven patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (age range 16-22 years; mean vital capacity 1.37 litres) with normal arterial blood gas tensions when awake were investigated by standard overnight polysomnography on an acclimatization night followed by two successive nights on which they received room air and nasal oxygen (2 litres/min) respectively in random order. Total sleep time, proportion of REM and non-REM sleep, and frequency and duration of arousals were similar on the two nights. When breathing air six of the seven subjects developed oxygen desaturation of more than 5% during REM sleep. With oxygen only one subject showed any oxygen desaturation exceeding 2.5%. Oxygen desaturation was associated with periods of hypopnoea or cessation of respiratory effort. The mean duration of episodes of hypopnoea and apnoea was prolonged during oxygen breathing by 19% and the mean duration of episodes during REM sleep by 33% (the proportion of REM sleep associated with hypopnoea and apnoea increased in all subjects). Heart rate in non-REM sleep fell by 9.3%; heart rate variation in REM and non-REM sleep was unchanged. These acute studies show that oxygen reduces the sleep hypoxaemia associated with respiratory muscle weakness; whether long term treatment will be possible or desirable is not clear as oxygen potentiates the underlying ventilatory disturbance.\r"

The brain:blood partition coefficient for trifluoromethane was 0.9 for both gray and white matter. Fast-compartment blood flows were normal and showed appropriate CO2 reactivity. Slow-compartment blood flows did not demonstrate CO2 reactivity, probably because cranial as well as white-matter blood flows were lumped together in the slow compartment. Although cerebral blood flow was stable during administration of 60% trifluoromethane, the compound did prove to be a mild cardiac sensitizer to epinephrine in five cats.\r"

All 10 treated cats retained measurable evoked potentials throughout the experiment. In five control cats, evoked potentials disappeared completely at some point during the occlusion (difference between groups significant at p less than 0.001). Mean amplitude of the major cortical wave in the nine treated cats with cerebral infarcts was higher than that of the nine corresponding controls (p less than 0.05). Lidocaine reduced the mean +/- SEM size of the infarcts from 30.1 +/- 6.0% in the control group to 14.7 +/- 4.9% in the treated group (p less than 0.05). As blood flow was reduced in the infarct and peri-infarct zones in the control but not the treated cats, our results suggest that the beneficial effects of lidocaine may be due to preservation of blood flow in the ischemic zone.\r"

We induced focal cerebral ischemia in 28 gerbils by occluding the common carotid artery. We recorded electrocorticograms in 34 gerbils by positioning bipolar electrodes between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. We related the electrocorticograms to local cerebral glucose utilization measured with [14C]2-deoxyglucose in half the gerbils. A characteristic pattern (a zone of markedly decreased [14C]2-deoxyglucose uptake surrounded by a narrow band of greatly increased uptake) was observed on the autoradiogram in nine of the 14 experimental gerbils (64%). An electrocorticogram recorded from such a band of increased uptake was characterized by transient suppression of electrical activity followed by partial or complete recovery, and local cerebral blood flow in gerbils showing this electrocorticographic type were variable (15.0-43.3 ml/100 g/min). An electrocorticogram recorded from the ischemic core and inner border of this band, even when [14C]2-deoxyglucose uptake was relatively high, was characterized by the complete disappearance of electrical activity just after occlusion; cerebral blood flow in gerbils that showed this electrocorticographic type were consistently less than 15.0 ml/100 g/min. Our investigation suggests that the transient disappearance of electrocorticographic activity in the periphery of ischemia, which has relatively high residual blood flow, may relate to the heterogeneity of glucose consumption during the early stage of ischemia.\r"

The group treated with pentobarbital alone also demonstrated increased survival (69.8 +/- 7.0%), but the combination of therapeutic regimens offered no apparent additive protection. By 5 days there were no differences in the neurologic deficit scores of the survivors in the groups. The toxic pulmonary effects of hyperbaric oxygen were assessed in a pilot LD50 study. The pressure used caused no mortality during 4 hours of exposure, and the calculated LD50 was 7.26 hours. This investigation demonstrates that graded doses of hyperbaric oxygen given after the insult increase survival in a gerbil model of stroke.\r"

  ".W": "We recorded somatosensory evoked potentials in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats before and after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Trigeminal (vibrissae), median (forelimb), and sciatic (hind limb) nerve stimuli produced consistent, robust, and sharply localized responses in the trigeminal, forelimb, and hind limb regions of the somatosensory cortex of 18 rats. These regions are situated at sequentially greater distances from the center of infarcts produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. In eight rats, occlusion 1-2 mm below the rhinal fissure abolished somatosensory evoked potentials in all three cortical region within minutes. Positive wavelets preceding the primary cortical response were also diminished by the occlusion, suggesting that ischemia affected the thalamocortical white matter. Four of these eight rats did not show histologically apparent ischemic involvement of the hind limb cortical region at 3 hours after occlusion; sciatic nerve evoked potentials recovered substantially in all four rats, and the amplitudes exceeded baseline (129 +/- 30% at 1 hour, 173 +/- 33% at 3 hours) in three of the four rats. Three of the eight rats did not have gross ischemic involvement of the forelimb cortical region; median nerve evoked potentials recovered fully in all eight rats, but the amplitudes did not exceed baseline. All eight rats had evidence of ischemic damage in the trigeminal cortex; no rat showed full recovery in this region, and all but one had trigeminal evoked potentials that were less than 20% of baseline amplitudes by 3 hours after occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

While basilar artery diameter after double experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in a series of untreated dogs (n = 34) averaged 65% of baseline diameter, arterial diameter in dogs treated prophylactically (n = 18) with 6 mg/kg/day cyclosporine A and adjunct low-dose steroid averaged 80% of baseline diameter, for a mean reduction in the severity of chronic arterial constriction of 42%. More important than the average effect, however, is the statistical observation that this mean improvement was obtained primarily by a dramatic reduction in the incidence of severe cerebral vasospasm, the situation most likely to account for morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal rupture.\r"

Baclofen (10 mg/kg i.p.) given 1 hour before and 30-60 minutes after 20 minutes of global ischemia did not lessen mortality, prevent ischemic cellular damage, or significantly improve working memory compared with no treatment.

Thus, there is increasing interest in identifying coronary artery disease in patients with cerebrovascular disease, including those without clinical manifestations of heart disease. We review the use of current noninvasive techniques to detect coronary artery disease and present practical approaches to screen for ischemic heart disease. Current diagnostic imaging methods for potential cardioembolic sources of cerebral infarction are also discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The traditional presentation of spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection includes ipsilateral hemicranial headache, oculosympathetic paresis, and contralateral focal cerebral ischemic deficits. However, we describe two cases with multiple cranial nerve involvement ipsilateral to the dissection as the principal feature. The first patient, a 36-year-old man, had involvement of the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th cranial nerves. The second case was a 53-year-old man with abnormalities of the 5th, 7th, 9th, 10th, and 12th cranial nerves. In both, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a ring-like area of abnormal signal intensity surrounding the carotid artery at the skull base. Carotid angiography was consistent with the suggestion of dissection on the magnetic resonance studies in both cases. The patients recovered without anticoagulation. Internal carotid artery dissection may thus present with multiple cranial nerve palsies, which could be mistaken for an infiltrating tumor of the skull base. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in identifying the condition.\r"

In eight patients the infarct was limited to the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and in only two patients was an ipsilateral to capsular pontine lacune found. Despite a location similar to that of pure motor and pure sensory lacunar stroke, hypesthetic ataxic hemiparesis correlates with larger infarcts, most often located in the posterior medial superior territory of the anterior choroidal artery. Some infarcts appeared to be localized immediately posterolateral to this region, in the posterior cerebral artery territory. The presence and extent of infarction is better detected by the addition of magnetic resonance imaging to computed tomography.\r"

We studied 12 patients with less than 75% stenosis of the internal carotid artery and a single hemispheric transient ischemic attack lasting less than 1 hour who had a normal neurologic examination 3-13 hours later and a normal computed tomogram 24-36 hours later. Single-photon emission computed tomography using technetium-99m HM-PAO less than or equal to 50 hours after the attack showed no abnormality in eight patients, but in the other four there was an area with 30-50% reduction in perfusion ipsilateral to the transient ischemic attack. Three of these four patients developed an ipsilateral infarct 3-7 days later, but none of the eight patients with normal single-photon emission computed tomograms had a stroke during the following weeks. No difference in therapy, risk factors, severity of internal carotid artery disease, or timing of the technetium-99m study could explain these findings. We suggest that some transient ischemic attacks, though clinically identical to others, may be associated with persisting focal hypoperfusion, which predisposes to early stroke.\r"

Blood flow was determined with xenon-133 inhalation and dynamic single-photon emission computed tomography at rest and 20 minutes after the intravenous injection of 1.0 g acetazolamide. After acetazolamide, the mean +/- SD increases in blood flow in the affected and contralateral cerebellar hemispheres were 11.1 +/- 3.7 and 12.0 +/- 5.3 ml/100 g/min, respectively; the difference between hemispheres was not significant. The absolute increase in cerebellar flow in these 11 patients was of the same magnitude as that in 12 healthy controls. We conclude that cerebellar vasoreactivity is intact in stroke patients with crossed cerebrocerebellar diaschisis of cerebral blood flow. Our results lend further support to the concept that reduced cerebellar blood flow is secondary to functional deactivation. Our patients were studied 2 weeks to 5 years after their stroke, indicating that this phenomenon may be persistent.\r"

Presaturation causes signal loss within the territory supplied by the presaturated artery, without affecting vessels not crossing the presaturation slab. The results were correlated with those from transcranial Doppler sonography and conventional angiography. Magnetic resonance angiography was able to demonstrate the direction of blood flow, the presence or absence of collateral blood flow, and the blood supply to the pericallosal arteries, as well as the presence of a fetal posterior circulation. Magnetic resonance angiography is a noninvasive means for imaging the blood supply of the major intracranial arteries.\r"

The average annual incidence rates of stroke were 2.8 and 2.0 per 1,000 population in males and females, respectively. Mean age at stroke onset was 63.3 and 71.4 years in males and females, respectively (p less than 0.01). According to the clinical classification of stroke, 76 patients suffered cerebral infarction, 21 cerebral bleeding, and six subarachnoid hemorrhage; six strokes were unclassified. The survival rates were compared by sex, age, and clinical stroke type using Cox's proportional hazards model. The survival rate of female stroke patients was lower than that of males, but not significantly so. The survival rate of stroke patients greater than or equal to 65 years old was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than that of younger patients. Moreover, the survival rate of patients with cerebral bleeding was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) than that of patients with cerebral infarction. In the analysis of self-care among the survivors, performance of the activities of daily living in older patients indicated significantly less independence (p less than 0.01) in younger patients. Follow-up of new stroke cases showed that age and clinical stroke type were significantly associated with survival and that age was also related to disability of the survivors.\r"

Both measures are reliable and valid. We used the Spearman correlation coefficient (r) and stepwise regression analysis to analyze the data. Balanced sitting and bladder control scores at 1 week correlated significantly with motor score at discharge (r = 0.83), Barthel Index score at discharge (r = 0.82), and walking score at discharge (r = 0.80). The combined arm score at 1 month correlated significantly with the combined arm score at discharge (r = 0.94). Regression equations using the scores at 1 month produced the highest r2 values (range 0.76-0.95) in predicting the Barthel Index, motor, walking, and arm recovery scores at discharge. The correlation coefficients and the regression equations have uses in both research and clinical settings. We suggest that these objective predictors of recovery be used as adjuncts in prioritizing and directing the rehabilitation management of patients with stroke.\r"

Sitting balance, a prerequisite for most functional activities, was scored using a four-point scale evaluating static and dynamic sitting balance on admission to the rehabilitation unit and weekly until discharge. Functional status was assessed using the Barthel Index 4 or 12 weeks after the stroke. We found a strong positive correlation between Barthel Index score and each weekly sitting balance score. Multiple evaluations over time identified those patients whose sitting balance improved during rehabilitation in our unit; after grouping the patients into those with normal, improved, and poor sitting balance, we found a significant difference in the Barthel Index scores among the three groups. The group of patients whose sitting balance improved had higher Barthel Index scores than the group whose sitting balance did not improve. Ongoing evaluation of sitting balance can be helpful in anticipating functional status at discharge in stroke patients undergoing comprehensive rehabilitation.\r"

Experiments in four baboons determined techniques and the safety of retroperfusion, and experiments in three baboons determined the ability of retroperfusion to reverse cerebral ischemia. Two baboons died before retroperfusion. Arterial blood was continuously circulated by an external pumping system from one femoral artery into the intracranial sinuses through specially designed balloon-tipped catheters placed percutaneously into the sigmoid sinuses bilaterally. The balloons intermittently occluded the sinuses. Ischemia was produced by occluding the left middle cerebral artery. Standard and computed electroencephalography with topographic mapping monitored the onset and reversal of ischemia. Retroperfusion rate exceeded 50 ml/min with a mean intrasinus pressure increase of 27 (0-149) mm Hg in all seven experiments. Venograms demonstrated complete or partial filling of the superior sagittal sinus in each experiment. Four experiments without ischemia established maximal balloon occlusion cycles, retroperfusion rates, and sinus pressure changes. These four baboons were neurologically normal after retroperfusion; two had normal magnetic resonance imaging scans. Ischemic changes, detected by electroencephalography following middle cerebral artery occlusion, were reversed with retroperfusion in all three ischemia experiments. Autopsies in the seven baboons demonstrated no parenchymal hemorrhage or edema. Our results suggest that further investigation of retroperfusion, and possibly retroinfusion of agents for cerebral protection, is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Many bubbles that enter the brain circulation pass through the arterioles and capillary beds and do not obstruct blood flow. Nevertheless, such bubbles could still disrupt brain function. An open-brain model in five anesthetized rabbits used the minimum dose of air (25 microliters) necessary to cause embolism of the exposed vessels, and these bubbles passed through the vessels without any trapping. Despite their rapid transit, the bubbles provoked a marked dilatation of the affected pial arterioles (mean increase after 15 minutes of 27%) that persisted for 90 minutes after the bubbles had disappeared. The changes in vessel diameter were associated with a delayed, but significant and progressive, reduction in both cerebral blood flow measured by hydrogen clearance and neural function measured by cortical somatosensory evoked response. The decrease in blood flow correlated well with the depression of neural function (r = 0.67). Because both cerebral blood flow and neural function temporarily returned to normal after air embolism, the subsequent changes seen in this model cannot be explained simply by the mechanical obstruction of blood flow by bubbles.\r"

We evaluated 80 patients with AIDS or ARC for the frequency of hypothalamic-pituitary or thyroid gland failure and altered serum thyroid hormone levels due to nonthyroidal disorders. One patient had subclinical hypothyroidism. Of these patients, 60% had low free triiodothyronine (T3) index values and 4% had low free thyroxine (T4) indexes; none of the latter had hypothalamic-pituitary or thyroid gland failure, since all serum cortisol values were greater than or equal to 552 nmol per liter (greater than or equal to 20 micrograms per dl) and all thyrotropin levels were less than or equal to 3 mU per liter (less than or equal to 3 microU per ml), respectively. Those who died had lower total T4 and T3, free T3 index, and albumin levels than those discharged from hospital. Serum total T4 and T3 levels correlated with albumin levels and total T3 with serum sodium levels. Serum total T3 levels best predicted the outcome of the hospital stay (accuracy = 82%). Thus, abnormal serum thyroid hormone levels in AIDS or ARC patients are most frequently due to nonthyroidal disorders, but hypothalamic-pituitary or thyroid gland failure may occur.\r"

Of 2,424 inquiries in 1986, 593 (24%) concerned hazards to pregnancy. This represents a 17-fold increase since 1981. Most pregnancy-related inquiries were from employees (70%) and health care providers (23%). Referral sources for the employees calls were almost exclusively individual health care providers or institutions that provide health care or health counseling, or both. These data suggest that pregnant employees seek information on their own or from health care providers instead of from employers. Of the inquiries, 80% were for general pregnancy hazard information; 20% involved symptomatic pregnant employees. Most inquiries concerned employment in the services (58%) and manufacturing (26%) sectors. Organic solvents, pesticides, acrylic nail-grooming products, lead, and video display terminals were among the agents about which callers inquired most frequently.\r"

In consequence, there has been increasing attention paid to the need for ambulatory care experience. A primary force in shaping the content of postgraduate medical education is \"The Essentials of Accredited Residencies,\" published in the Directory of Graduate Medical Education Programs. We reviewed recommendations and requirements for ambulatory settings and outpatient experience as specified in the Directory during the years 1961 to 1988 and investigated pending changes in requirements for five major specialties: internal medicine, pediatrics, family practice, general surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology. Increases in the amount of time residents spend in ambulatory care training recently have been mandated in internal medicine and are under consideration in two other specialties, indicating probable major shifts in the locus of postgraduate medical training.\r"
