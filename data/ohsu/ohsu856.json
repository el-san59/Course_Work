Abnormalities in p53 expression were found in 28 of 40 carcinomas, 14 of 17 squamous tumours showing abnormal p53 expression, whereas no expression of p53 was detectable in 7 carcinoid tumours or in 10 normal lung samples. Direct evidence for homozygous expression of mutant p53 mRNA in representative carcinomas was obtained by means of an asymmetric polymerase chain reaction mRNA sequencing strategy, which allowed sequencing without any cloning step. All the mutations were G to T transversions resulting in mis-sense mutations in aminoacids highly conserved in evolution. Mutation of the p53 gene is the most frequently identified genetic change in human lung cancer; these findings suggest that simple immunohistological methods can provide strong evidence of such mutation.\r"

This process is probably non-enzymatic and is aspirin insensitive.

To resolve these controversies we performed evoked response and nerve conduction studies in 10 males with vitamin B12 deficiency. The minimum criteria for this diagnosis were diminished position and vibration sensation and vitamin B12 levels less than 220 pg/ml. We found normal BAERs in 9/10 patients. The central interpeak latencies of the median and peroneal SERs were abnormal in 4/10 and 8/8 patients, respectively. The VERs were abnormal in 7/10 patients. We found absent or diminished amplitudes of sural sensory and peroneal motor action potentials in 8/10 patients. Abnormal peroneal F response chronodispersion was present in 7/10 patients. Nerve conduction velocities (NCV) were normal in 9/10 patients. EMG demonstrated abnormalities consistent with denervation in lower extremity muscles in 8/10 patients. These studies present a profile of vitamin B12 deficiency: essentially normal BAERs, mildly abnormal VERs and median SERs, and markedly abnormal peroneal SERs. NCV studies are consistent with sensory-motor axonopathy.\r"

SFEMG revealed increased fiber density (FD) and large macro-MUP potentials indicating pronounced reinnervation as compensation to loss of motor neurons. From electrophysiological data of motor unit size, morphometric measures of fiber size, and muscle strength data, the minimal degree of motor neuron loss was estimated to be greater than 70%.\r"

  ".W": "Pancreatic tissue obtained by hemipancreatectomy from healthy living related donors has been transplanted into recipients with Type I diabetes mellitus. To determine the metabolic consequences of this procedure for the donors, we carried out oral glucose-tolerance testing and 24-hour monitoring of serum glucose levels and urinary C-peptide excretion as a measure of insulin secretion in 28 donors, both before and one year after hemipancreatectomy. The mean fasting serum glucose level was significantly higher one year after the procedure (mean +/- SD, 5.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 4.9 +/- 0.5 mmol per liter; P less than 0.003), as was the serum glucose value two hours after the administration of glucose (8.7 +/- 2.9 vs. 6.5 +/- 1.0 mmol per liter; P less than 0.001). The fasting serum insulin level was significantly lower one year after hemipancreatectomy (33.0 +/- 21.6 vs. 38.4 +/- 21.6 pmol per liter; P less than 0.05), as was the area under the insulin curves during the oral glucose-tolerance test (52,554 +/- 22,320 vs. 76,230 +/- 33,354 pmol per liter per minute; P less than 0.04). The mean 24-hour serum glucose-profile value was higher at one year, and the 24-hour urinary C-peptide excretion was lower in the 17 donors who underwent these studies. Seven of the 28 donors had abnormal glucose tolerance one year after hemipancreatectomy; however, insulin secretion in these 7 donors was indistinguishable from that in the 21 donors who had normal glucose tolerance. All 28 donors had fasting serum glucose concentrations lower than 7.8 mmol per liter, and their mean 24-hour plasma glucose levels remained within the normal range. We conclude that in healthy donors hemipancreatectomy results in a deterioration of insulin secretion and glucose tolerance, as measured one year later. Further study is required to ascertain whether the development of clinical diabetes mellitus is a risk inherent in hemipancreatectomy.\r"

  ".W": "The deposition of silica particles in the lung of man or experimental animals leads to silicosis, a disease of progressive respiratory failure caused by a fibrotic reaction. It has long been suspected that the phagocytosis of silica by pulmonary macrophages induces the secretion of fibrogenic factors. Several potentially fibrogenic cytokines released by macrophages have been identified, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Here we show that TNF plays an important part in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice in that (1) a single instillation of silica leads to a marked increase in the level of lung TNF messenger RNA which lasts for greater than 70 days, while there are no obvious changes in the amounts of IL-1 alpha or TGF-beta mRNAs; and (2) silica-induced collagen deposition is almost completely prevented by anti-TNF antibody, but is significantly increased by continuous infusion of mouse recombinant TNF.\r"

  ".U": "90190841\r", 
  ".W": "Expression of the multicomponent T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex on the surface of thymocytes is developmentally controlled. Most immature CD4-CD8- 'double negative' and CD4+CD8+ 'double positive' thymocytes express either no or few TCR on their surface, and maturation to CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+ 'single positive' thymocytes is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of surface TCR complexes. Although the initial appearance of TCR during differentiation results from rearrangement and initiation of transcription of TCR genes in the thymus, the mechanisms regulating the quantitative changes in TCR expression during intrathymic differentiation are unknown. Surface TCR levels in T-hybridoma cells can be quantitatively regulated by a series of post-translational processes, including sorting to alternative intracellular compartments and degradation, which ensure that only fully and correctly assembled receptor complexes are efficiently transported to the cell surface. Quantitative increases in TCR expression on the surface of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes occur in vivo in response to anti-CD4 antibody treatment. Here we present evidence that immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes normally retain and degrade in the endoplasmic reticulum greater than 90% of some endogenously synthesized TCR chains, and that the increased surface TCR expression on immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes induced by anti-CD4 is due to an increase in the escape of newly synthesized receptor chains from the endoplasmic reticulum, and is not due to increases in RNA levels, translation, or assembly. Post-translational mechanisms therefore control the levels of TCR complexes on CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, and these mechanisms can be modulated by signalling through CD4 surface molecules.\r"

In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, some patients have a breakpoint within the major breakpoint cluster region of the bcr gene, whereas others have the break within its first intron. This second type of translocation results in the transcription of a 7.0-kilobase chimaeric bcr/abl messenger RNA translated into a bcr/abl fusion protein, p190, which has an abnormal tyrosine kinase activity and is strongly autophosphorylated in vitro. We have generated mice transgenic for a bcr/abl p190 DNA construct and find that progeny are either moribund with, or die of acute leukaemia (myeloid or lymphoid) 10-58 days after birth. This finding is evidence for a causal relationship between the Philadelphia chromosome and human leukaemia.\r"

There is accumulating evidence that such oxidized lipoproteins have an important role in atherosclerosis. Treatment of endothelial cells with altered lipoproteins stimulates monocyte binding as well as the production of chemotactic factors for monocytes. Both these findings could be relevant to the accumulation of monocytes-macrophages in the arterial wall during the early stages of lesion development. We now report that treatment of endothelial cells (EC) with modified low-density lipoproteins obtained by mild iron oxidation or by prolonged storage, results in a rapid and large induction of the expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage CSF (M-CSF) and granulocyte CSF (G-CSF). These growth factors affect the differentiation, survival, proliferation, migration and metabolism of macrophages/granulocytes, and G-CSF and GM-CSF also affect the migration and proliferation of EC. Because EC and macrophages are important in the development of atherosclerosis, the expression of the CSFs by these cells could contribute to the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Induction of transcription of the immediate-early (IE) genes of herpes simplex virus (HSV) involves the assembly of a DNA-binding complex containing the cellular transcription factor Oct-1 and the virus regulatory protein Vmw65 (VP16). Complex assembly can be observed using deletion variants of Vmw65 which lack the acidic C-terminal activation domain and are therefore defective for IE transactivation. Similar variants of Vmw65 interfere with IE activation by the normal protein, and with HSV replication. It has therefore been suggested that dominant interfering products of viruses such as HSV and HIV could be used in a form of intracellular immunization against virus infection. Here we report that a small peptide overlapping a region of Vmw65 which is critical for complex assembly specifically inhibits assembly of the complex but has no observed effect on the DNA-binding activity of the cellular factor alone. Selective interference with the assembly of transcription complexes by short peptides corresponding to functionally critical regions of virus regulatory proteins may be more feasible than the use of defective polypeptides as an antiviral strategy based on competitive interference.\r"

During myogenesis in vivo and in vitro, expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) undergoes an isoform transition that precisely correlates with terminal myoblast differentiation and myotube formation. Altered processing of RNA results in the replacement of the transmembrane NCAM (relative molecular mass, 145,000 (145K) in proliferating myoblasts by a predominant 125K NCAM form linked to glycosyl phosphatidylinositol in myotubes. We now report that mouse myoblasts transfected to constitutively express the human muscle-specific 125K glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked NCAM isoform more readily fuse to form myotubes. This suggests that NCAM plays a part in myoblast fusion and that the isoform switch may promote this function.\r"

Capping protein has been identified in all eukaryotic cells examined so far; it is a heterodimer with subunits of relative molecular masses 32,000-36,000 (alpha-subunit) and 28,000-32,000 (beta-subunit). In skeletal muscle, capping protein (CapZ) probably binds the barbed ends of actin filaments at the Z line. The in vivo role of this protein in non-muscle cells is not known. We report here the characterization of CAP2, the single gene encoding the beta-subunit of capping protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast cells in which the CAP2 gene was disrupted by an insertion or a deletion had an abnormal actin distribution, including the loss of actin cables. The mutant cells were round and large, with a heterogeneous size distribution, and, although viable, grew more slowly than congenic wild-type cells. Chitin, a cell wall component restricted to the mother-bud junction in wild-type budding yeast, was found on the entire mother cell surface in the mutants. The phenotype of CAP2 disruption resembled that of temperature-sensitive mutations in the yeast actin gene ACT1, indicating that capping protein regulates actin-filament distribution in vivo.\r"

IgM immunoreactivity appeared in neurons 1 to 2 days following injection in their terminal fields. Several neural pathways supported retrograde axonal transport of IgM, including facial nucleus, hypoglossal nucleus, and thalamic projections. Although the IgM studied had a greater affinity for Thy 1.1 than the IgG, IgM axonal transport was more difficult to detect than axonal transport of IgG, suggesting that IgM undergoes retrograde axonal transport less readily than IgG. An increase in intraneuronal IgM may serve as an index of the action of antineuronal IgM at the presynaptic membrane, and intraneuronal IgM may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of some types of motor neuron disease and neuropathy.\r"

Resistance in the common carotid artery, measured by the resistivity index, was significantly lower in the group with OAC than in those without OAC, indicating a shunt to the low resistance intracranial circuit. The pulsatility index (PI) of the Doppler signal in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery, a measure of both inflow pressure and distal vascular resistance, did not differ between those with and without OAC. However, the presence of circle of Willis collateral pathways (anterior communicating and/or posterior communicating artery) did appear to have a significant effect on pulsatility. When both were present angiographically, PI was higher than in the group with only 1 Willisian collateral. These findings suggest that OAC has a marginal effect on vascular resistance in arterial bed distal to an ICAO, while Willisian collaterals appear to have a more important role in cerebral perfusion, as measured indirectly by Doppler methods.\r"

We detected abnormalities by peripheral motor conduction studies in 33 of 44 nerves, by F waves in 31, by SEPs in 23, and by peripheral sensory conduction in 17. The cumulative sensitivity increased with the testing of multiple nerves by motor nerve conduction, sensory nerve conduction, and F-wave studies, but not with multiple SEPs. F-wave studies were significantly more sensitive than SEPs in identifying abnormalities.

This is a relatively modest cognitive impairment thought to be common enough to be a feature of normal aging. There is considerable interest among memory researchers, and in the pharmaceutical industry, to establish the neurochemical basis and develop effective treatment for this condition. As in studies of dementia, much attention is focused on cholinergic function in relation to AAMI, with less emphasis on other neurochemical systems, such as those containing catecholamines. Diminished catecholamine function is implicated in dementing illness of the aged and may also be important in AAMI. This article proposes a role for catecholamines in AAMI and discusses possible treatment strategies.\r"

The gestational age at the time of transfusion was 21-31 weeks (mean +/- SD 25 +/- 3.1). The fetal hematocrits before transfusion ranged from 12-32% (23.4 +/- 6.1), whereas the hematocrit after transfusion was between 25-42% (35 +/- 5). The net blood volume transfused (volume infused--volume removed) ranged between 7.5-31.0 mL (16.0 +/- 7.4). The hematocrit of the transfused blood varied between 68-81% (74 +/- 4). Repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated significant differences in the pulsatility index values of the four vessels studied. The same analysis indicated significant differences in the pulsatility index values at the three time points. Multiple comparison tests showed that the pulsatility index was reduced significantly immediately after transfusion for each vessel studied, but returned to pretransfusion levels by the next day. These data suggest a change in vascular impedance soon after transfusion as a consequence of direct intravascular transfusion.\r"

The SPO responses were similar among these subgroups. Despite current ACOG recommendations, most clinicians practice universal screening for gestational diabetes. Significant discrepancies appear to exist between ACOGb versus ACOGa and SPO with regard to methods of glucose surveillance and the threshold for initiating insulin therapy in gestational diabetes. Intensive fetal surveillance, elective delivery, and high cesarean rates are common in pregnancies complicated by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, which is most often managed by a perinatologist or by an obstetrician in consultation with an internist. Few insulin-dependent patients seek preconceptional care.\r"

The relaxation response group showed significantly greater improvement than the charting and the reading groups on physical symptoms (P less than .025 for both comparisons). There was a significant group-by-severity effect for charting versus relaxation response and for reading versus relaxation response on symptoms measured daily (P less than .01 for both comparisons), on emotional symptoms measured retrospectively (P less than .001 and P less than .025, respectively), and on symptoms of social withdrawal measured retrospectively (P less than .01 and P less than .025, respectively). Women with severe symptoms in the relaxation response group showed a 58.0% improvement, compared with a 27.2% improvement for the reading group and a 17.0% improvement for the charting group. We conclude that regular elicitation of the relaxation response is an effective treatment for physical and emotional premenstrual symptoms, and is most effective in women with severe symptoms.\r"

The TENS setting used was 100 pulses per second with 100-microsecond pulse widths. The subjects were allowed to adjust the amplitude to a comfortable level. The pain rescue medication was ibuprofen 400 mg as needed, up to 1600 mg/day. Significantly more subjects who had TENS treatment did not require rescue medication or required less backup ibuprofen at 0-4, 4-8, and 8-12 hours after the onset of dysmenorrhea and starting treatment, as well as during the first 24 hours and for the duration of the menstrual flow, when compared with placebo TENS or ibuprofen-treated cycles (Tukey multiple comparison, P less than .01). Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation significantly delayed the need for ibuprofen by an average of 5.9 hours, compared with 0.7 hours when using ibuprofen alone (P less than .05, paired t test). Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation alone provided good to excellent subjective pain relief in 42.4% of subjects, compared with 3.2% with placebo TENS, and significantly reduced diarrhea, menstrual flow, clot formation, and fatigue compared with placebo TENS. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation plus less ibuprofen provided pain relief equivalent to that obtained with ibuprofen alone (71 and 75% of the subjects, respectively). We conclude that TENS is a safe, effective, non-medication method for managing primary dysmenorrhea and that TENS plus ibuprofen was the best overall treatment, as indicated by pain relief.\r"

Characteristics that predicted the likelihood of seeking reanastomosis information were examined in multivariate, logistic regression models that included age, race, number of living children, history of abortion, education, timing of sterilization in relation to pregnancy, initial marital status, and change in marital status. Among the women studied, 6.2% reported that they had sought information on reanastomosis. Women who were younger than 30 years old at the time of sterilization were twice as likely to seek such information as women aged 30-34, and women who had experienced changes in martial status after sterilization were 2.8 times as likely to seek information as women with unchanged marital status. Thirteen women had actually obtained reanastomosis. Compared with the overall study population, these women were more likely to be white, to have lower gravidity, to be younger, and to have experienced changes in marital status.\r"

Thirty-two patients were registered in the study and 23 were fully evaluable for response and toxicity. Carboplatin was administered in a dose of 400 mg/m2 at 28-day intervals without concomitant hydration if blood counts had recovered sufficiently. There were seven responses (two complete and five partial responses) among the 23 evaluable patients, for an overall response rate of 30%. Four (two of two complete responders and two of five partial responders) of the seven responding patients remain alive at 839+ to 987+ days from the start of therapy. The two complete responders and one of the partial responders had small-volume disease, which may have contributed to their prolonged survival. Myelosuppression was the most prominent toxicity encountered. Seventeen of 27 patients evaluable for toxicity developed platelet counts of less than 75 X 10(3)/muL during therapy, but no hemorrhagic complications were encountered. Leukopenia was less prominent, with only nine of 27 patients developing white blood cell counts of less than 3.0 X 10(3)/microL. No important nephrotoxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. Emesis occurred in ten of 27 patients but was not dose-limiting. No unexpected toxicities were encountered. Carboplatin appears to be an active agent in the treatment of endometrial carcinoma.\r"

Saliva and serum CA 125 levels were assayed in specimens obtained from 55 normal healthy women, 92 patients with benign pelvic masses, and 41 patients with malignant pelvic tumors. We defined a serum CA 125 value greater than 65 U/mL and a saliva CA 125 value greater than 3000 U/mL as the positivity criteria. No serum or saliva assay was positive in the 55 normal women. The sensitivities of the saliva and serum CA 125 assays in 16 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer were 81.3 and 93.8%, respectively. A linear correlation was observed between serum and saliva CA 125 levels. The false-positive rates of serum CA 125 in patients with endometriomas and pelvic tuberculosis were 72.7 and 80%, respectively, but the false-positive rates for saliva CA 125 assays were only 13.6 and 10%, respectively. Therefore, the saliva CA 125 assay had a better diagnostic value than the serum CA 125 assay. In addition, collection of saliva is simple, noninvasive, and inexpensive, and samples could be obtained easily and repeatedly. For these reasons, assays of saliva CA 125 levels may be a new way of screening for malignant ovarian tumors.\r"

Selective reduction of the number of fetuses in a multiple gestation to reduce this risk, using transvaginal ultrasound, is a recent technological development. Six patients (three with quadruplets and three with triplets) underwent selective embryo reduction in the first trimester using real-time transvaginal ultrasound. Potassium chloride was used for intrathoracic injection. One of the procedures was complicated by chorioamnionitis 48 hours later, necessitating termination of pregnancy. Transvaginal sonographically directed selective reduction represents an important addition to the management of unplanned multiple pregnancy resulting from infertility treatment. The procedure is not without risks, and these must be weighed against potential benefits.\r"

  ".W": "Estrogen appears to protect against the development of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in women, by a number of mechanisms. The protective effect is believed to be mediated principally by beneficial changes in cholesterol levels. Estrogen decreases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by mechanisms that include the possible induction of LDL receptors and the destruction of hepatic lipase, which degrades HDL cholesterol. However, estrogen also appears to have a direct beneficial effect on vessel-wall physiology. One of these effects may be an increase in local prostacyclin production. The type of estrogen used in hormone replacement therapy and the route of administration determine the positive and negative effects of estrogen on the cardiovascular system. In general, synthetic estrogens, because they are manyfold more potent than natural estrogens, should not be used. Most studies show a 50% or greater reduction in cardiovascular disease and related mortality with postmenopausal estrogen administration. There is no evidence that postmenopausal estrogen replacement adversely affects carbohydrate metabolism, blood pressure, or coagulation. By use of a mathematical model to study the overall effects of estrogen therapy, it can be shown that more lives can be saved from the reduction in cardiovascular disease with estrogen use than from the reduction in death from osteoporosis or any other disease state affected by estrogen. Serious consideration has to be given to the cardiovascular effects of added progestogen, which may attenuate or eliminate the beneficial effects of estrogen on HDL2 cholesterol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sexual function is influenced by biologic and nonbiologic factors. Sexual arousal, including sensory perception, central and peripheral nerve discharge, peripheral blood flow, and the capacity to develop muscle tension, as well as sexual desire and frequency of sexual activity, can all be influenced by ovarian hormone levels. Sexual function is also influenced by the interplay of psychological, sociocultural, and interpersonal factors.

Subsequently, investigations into the pathogenesis of flushes pointed to increasingly higher levels of control. The observed relationship between estrogen deprivation and vasomotor instability led to the hypothesis of a cause-effect relationship with LH and FSH. However, patients with pituitary insufficiency were found to have hot flushes despite a lack of LH and FSH secretion. Hypothalamic secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) was studied for possible correlation with vasomotor episodes. Patients with and without symptoms had similar levels of LH secretion, but those who had symptoms and were closer to menopause had higher peripheral levels of immunoreactive GnRH, implying involvement of a hypothalamic mechanism, although not a cause-effect relationship. With prolonged estrogen deficiency, immunoreactive GnRH levels decline. Vasomotor episodes occur after estrogen withdrawal in subgroups of patients without appreciable secretion of GnRH, although LH and FSH secretions remain elevated. Vasomotor flushes are treated most effectively with estrogen. Agents such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and lofexidine may reduce the incidence of flushes.\r"

  ".W": "Half of women who develop osteoporosis will sustain some form of osteoporotic fracture. Fracture incidence is directly related to bone density, which is determined by peak adult bone mass and the amount of postmenopausal bone loss. Peak adult bone mass is, to a large extent, genetically determined, but hormonal factors (time since menopause, number of pregnancies, and previous oral contraceptive use) are the prime determinants of bone density after menopause. Time elapsed since menopause, rather than chronological age, determines skeletal composition; oral contraceptive use and parity appear to have a positive effect on the skeleton. Nonhormonal factors such as body weight and some forms of weight-bearing exercise appear to correlate with bone density at certain skeletal sites. Hormone replacement in the early postmenopausal period is the most effective means of preventing osteoporosis and can have a major impact on the incidence of subsequent fracture. Calcitonin may be used as an alternative when hormonal therapy is contraindicated. Established osteoporosis is difficult to treat because bone density has fallen below the fracture threshold and trabecular elements may have been lost. Antiresorptive agents can be used to prevent further bone loss, and stimulation of new bone formation by use of anabolic steroids or fluoride may increase the overall amount of bone.\r"

The benefits of hormone replacement include protection from osteoporosis, elimination of vasomotor symptoms, improvement in general well-being, and some decrease in the risk of cardiovascular disease. Some evidence suggests that the addition of androgen therapy to estrogen replacement in the premenopausal woman can also be beneficial. Administration of hormonal therapy to certain premenopausal patients who have had a bilateral oophorectomy is controversial. These include patients who are disease-free after surgery for endometrial carcinoma and patients who are post-therapy for breast carcinoma. The most common question is whether a progestin should be given to the patient receiving estrogen therapy after a hysterectomy. Prevention of endometrial carcinoma is unnecessary in this patient, but the effects of the progestin on the breast and the cardiovascular system should be considered.\r"

The risk of cardiovascular disease increases in women after menopause; in both men and women, regular aerobic exercise may improve cardiorespiratory endurance and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Aerobic exercise also prevents some age-related increases in body fat and it elevates resting metabolic rate, which correlates directly with lean body mass. Inactivity, not hormonal change, is the most common cause of obesity. Resistance training can improve muscle strength and bone density. Increases in bone mineral content have been found at lumbar vertebral and distal radial sites in women who participate in exercise programs. Weight-bearing exercise in conjunction with estrogen replacement therapy and calcium supplementation helps to prevent osteoporosis. Many women experience mood changes at menopause. Some of these symptoms are caused by chronic sleep deprivation due to night flushes and respond best to estrogen; others are related to levels of brain chemicals and respond favorably to exercise.\r"

Unopposed estrogen replacement increases the risk of endometrial cancer not only while treatment is being taken but also for many years after it is discontinued. Strategies must be developed for posttreatment surveillance. The addition of a cyclic progestogen reduces this risk, but it is not clear whether the reduction is to, or below, that observed in an untreated population. Protective doses of C-19 (norethindrone) and C-21 (medroxy-progesterone acetate) progestogens are suggested. All progestogens may cause physical, psychological, and metabolic side effects. In addition, most women taking cyclic progestogens experience regular withdrawal bleeding. Continuous/combined therapy has been introduced to minimize these side effects and induce amenorrhea. Published data on the efficacy and safety of continuous combined therapy are few. Although the regimen is effective in relieving menopausal symptoms and inducing endometrial atrophy in most patients, side effects of progestogen are common and there is a high incidence of bleeding in the first few months, which is unacceptable to many patients. In our view, the effect of continuous combined therapy on lipids and lipoproteins has not been properly addressed. Based upon the available literature, we believe that the enthusiasm for continuous combined therapy is premature and we urge caution in its use until further, more conclusive, data become available.\r"

Parenteral administration results in predictable absorption without major intermediary metabolism, whereas all oral estrogens are subject to intestinal metabolism before entering the systemic circulation. Various options are available. Injectable estrogens, because of rapid absorption and metabolism, are impractical for long-term replacement therapy. The primary drawback to subcutaneous estradiol pellets is the surgical procedure required for their insertion and removal. Vaginal epithelium is an effective pathway for absorption of estrogen given by solution, tablet, or cream, although only the latter is currently approved for clinical use; relatively constant serum levels of estradiol can be obtained with vaginal rings. Transdermal patches provide controlled hormone levels for up to 3.5 days. Although oral conjugated equine estrogens have been used extensively, they introduce types of estrogen, such as equilin, that are not naturally found in humans and that can produce a pronounced hepatic response. Micronized estradiol, oral estrone, and other estrogens have been used as alternatives to equine estrogens. Clinicians should understand the pharmacokinetics of the various options for replacement therapy and select a course of treatment that is safe, effective, and convenient for the patient.\r"

  ".W": "One of the most common gynecologic complaints is urinary incontinence, which afflicts approximately one third of the female population. In urodynamic units, approximately 80 per cent of women with urinary incontinence have detrusor hyperreflexia as the sole reason for, or as a component of, their incontinence problem. Approximately 80 to 85 per cent of patients with detrusor hyperreflexia have a functional neuromuscular disturbance of their detrusor muscle. One to 2 per cent of the patients seen in our urodynamic unit have detrusor hyperreflexia caused by a neurogenic bladder. As our clinic's population ages, this type of functional neuromuscular disturbance--neurogenic bladder problem--will increase. The neuromuscular control of the lower urinary tract is complex and not fully understood, explaining why we are unable to treat the functional neuromuscular disturbance in some patients effectively and why we may have to try several drugs before finding one that is effective in other patients. Although patients may have the same symptoms and even the same urodynamic findings, the cause of the functional neuromuscular disturbance may be different. One patient may respond to drug A and not to drug B, and another patient with virtually the same symptoms and urodynamic findings responds to drug B and not to drug A. The main neurologic control of the lower urinary tract is through the sacral outflow of somatic and (mainly) parasympathetic nerve fibers. There appears to be an \"on-off\" control mechanism involving the urethrovesical unit wherein there is parasympathetic inhibition of the detrusor muscle and parasympathetic stimulation of the urethral smooth muscle and stimulation of somatic nerves to the urethral striated muscle at rest. Reverse action occurs when the patient voids. For this reason, cholinergic and anticholinergic drugs exert a powerful influence on the lower urinary tract. Adrenergic control through alpha 1- (and indirectly alpha 2-) and beta 2-receptors (with a preponderance of alpha-receptors in urethral smooth musculature and a preponderance of beta-receptors in the detrusor muscle) appears to modulate and modify parasympathetic action. This explains why adrenergic stimulant and blocker drugs, in most women, do not affect the lower urinary tract as much as parasympathomimetic-lytic drugs. However, adrenergic effect seems to be greater in some women than in others, explaining, for example, why some patients with detrusor hyperreflexia respond to beta 2-stimulatory drugs and not to anticholinergic drugs. Also inter-twined in the neuromuscular control of the lower urinary tract are the roles of prostaglandins and calcium-potassium channel changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90191513\r", 
  ".W": "The two functions of the lower urinary tract are storage of urine within the bladder and timely expulsion of urine from the urethra. Bladder filling occurs with little or no increase in intravesical pressure, despite large increases in urine volume. This process, called accommodation, results from viscoelastic properties of the bladder wall and reflex inhibition of detrusor contractility. Urinary continence is maintained at rest by outflow resistance generated by the urethral sphincteric mechanism. With increases in intra-abdominal pressure, urethral resistance is augmented by passive pressure transmission to the bladder neck and proximal urethra and possibly by reflex muscular activity within the urogenital diaphragm. Normal voiding is a reflex act under voluntary control that involves relaxation of the urethra and sustained contraction of the bladder until emptying is complete. The ICS has classified lower urinary tract dysfunction as disorders of the filling or storage phase and as disorders of the emptying phase. Although urodynamic testing is not always necessary, some evaluation of both bladder and urethral function in each phase is required for accurate diagnosis.\r"

  ".U": "90191519\r", 
  ".W": "The cause of detrusor instability and mixed incontinence remains elusive. Although DI is most prevalent at the extremes of age, GSI becomes more common with aging and child bearing, and therefore mixed incontinence is common, especially after menopause. Cystometry is used to diagnosis detrusor instability, but urethral closure pressure profilometry is required for assessment of mixed incontinence. DI is managed initially by behavioral therapy, and if this is not satisfactory then FES should be used depending upon availability. Drug therapy should start with oxybutynin at 2.5 to 5 mg twice-daily and increased as necessary to control symptoms. If the effects of therapy are minimal or side effects are too great, other medications or medication combinations should be tried. When the patient does not respond to this level of therapy, transvesical phenol injections should be considered, or, alternatively, a sacral selective neurolysis or neurectomy should be considered. Finally, invasive procedures will have to be considered starting with bladder transection, especially for the patient showing response to medication but intolerant of side effects. Mixed incontinence should be approached with conservative measures for each component. FES or imipramine therapy may help both conditions. If conservative therapy is not beneficial, surgical correction for GSI should be undertaken, with the knowledge that 35 to 50 per cent of patients will also have cure of DI, while the remainder can be treated medically for the DI.\r"

Complaints of urinary frequency and urgency most often accompany voiding dysfunction. Associated symptoms, which are not always present, include postvoid fullness, poor flow, hesitancy, and complete urinary retention. Obstructive uroflowmetry and elevated residual urine are suggestive screening tests; however, complete multichannel urodynamic evaluation is necessary to arrive at a specific diagnosis. Once a diagnosis has been made, therapy will be directed at either increasing vesical contractility or reducing bladder outlet obstruction. Acute urinary retention should be dealt with initially by bladder decompression via catheterization. Regardless of the cause of the voiding dysfunction, if further therapy is unsuccessful, clean intermittent self-catheterization may prove to be the best alternative. This can ensure maintenance of relatively low intravesical pressure and residual urine, thus reducing the risk of urinary infection.\r"

The peak age frequency of occurrence is at least a decade earlier than that described in Western literature. Sex ratio reveals a 2:1 preponderance of male patients. Only 10% to 15% of cases present in localized stages. The poor survival revealed by existing studies is mainly due to the overwhelming proportion of advanced cases.

Mucositis severity was significantly less compared to the control chemotherapy group on day 14 (p less than 0.03), day 21 (p less than 0.04), and on 1 week follow-up (p less than 0.02). Concomitant trends in the reduction in oral streptococci and yeast were noted in the chemotherapy group receiving chlorhexidine mouthrinse. Although no differences were observed in oral mucositis between the control and chlorhexidine groups of patients undergoing high-dose radiotherapy, similar reductions of oral microflora to those seen in the chemotherapy population were also noted for patients undergoing radiation therapy who received chlorhexidine. Although generally not significant, some increase in gram-negative bacilli was noted in the chlorhexidine-treated patients in both the chemotherapy and radiotherapy groups, but there was no correlation with increased systemic infection. Prophylactic chlorhexidine mouthrinse reduces oral mucositis and microbial burden in patients with cancer undergoing intensive chemotherapy.\r"

The potential utility of photodynamic therapy coupled with other cancer therapies is very intriguing. The whole area of photodynamic therapy in viral disease is just being opened to clinical investigation. As laser technology improves and as laboratory experience with known photosensitizers continues and new photosensitizers are developed, more significant clinical contributions will surely be made.\r"

Serum samples from 22 mothers were all reactive to HHV-6 antigens, as evidenced by immunofluorescence and radioimmunoprecipitation analyses.\r"

A total of 67 children, 28 girls and 39 boys, were identified as having had tularemia. The occurrence of the disease varied greatly among years. Most of the cases occurred in July, August and September. The epidemiology differed significantly from that reported for F. tularensis biovar tularensis (type A). This is most probably attributable to the different vector, which was the mosquito in our series, but the tick in areas where type A is common. There were also clear differences in the clinical picture. The ulceroglandular clinical type was the most common. The clinical symptoms and signs were usually quite benign, but the symptoms lasted for a median duration of 26 days. The patients were treated with different antibiotics and there were no differences in the outcome related to the treatment given. Prospective comparative investigations of antibiotic therapy given for tularemia are needed. It is also important to try to identify which strain is causing the disease in each case.\r"

The other 3 patients received amikacin in 2 and gentamicin and tobramycin in the other. Seven patients were cured clinically and 3 died; 9 were cured bacteriologically and one who was presumed cured on the basis of clinical response subsequently died.

This was done with bacteriologic surveillance and analysis of the positive blood cultures from 1978 through 1987. A change in the relative numbers of isolated pathogens was observed; Klebsiella sp. and Escherichia coli decreased whereas Enterobacter sp. increased. The susceptibility of the Enterobacter isolates to cefamandole decreased from 85.3% in 1982 to 52.9% in 1983. The susceptibility of these bacteria to cefotaxime was 55.2% in 1983 and 55.0% in 1987. No change in susceptibilities to cefotaxime, amoxicillin or gentamicin was found in other pathogens. Although colonization with Enterobacter strains has increased and the susceptibility of these bacteria to the cephalosporins has decreased, the incidence of serious infections with Gram-negative bacteria decreased.\r"

In sharp contrast to the 3 cases seen in 1986, 14 cases were diagnosed in 1987 (a significant increase from 1985 to 1986, P = 0.001). In the first 6 months of 1988 an additional 12 new cases were diagnosed (a further significant increase from 1987, P = 0.02). No further cases were diagnosed between July, 1988, and September, 1989. The major clinical manifestations were carditis in 73%, polyarthritis in 58% and chorea in 31%. In 15 of 26 patients an antecedent illness which included pharyngitis was noted; the remainder of patients were asymptomatic. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 13 of 19 children cultured. Isolates from two patients with acute rheumatic fever were submitted for M typing: one isolate was mucoid M18/T18; the other isolate was a mucoid nontypable strain. The demographic characteristics of the 26 patients agree with classic descriptions in that patients were more likely to be urban, to come from large families and to have low incomes; racial breakdown of the group mirrored the Tennessee pediatric population. These characteristics stand in contrast to reports of recent outbreaks which describe suburban high income patients. These data suggest that practitioners should be again aware of acute rheumatic fever and that aggressive identification and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis should continue to be a relevant public health concern.\r"

The study, conducted at six neonatal care centers, randomly assigned 1339 newborn infants to phototherapy or control groups by the following subgroups: (1) birth weight less than 2000 g; (2) birth weight 2000 to 2499 g and bilirubin level greater than 171 mumol/L (10 mg/dL); or (3) birth weight greater than or equal to 2500 g and bilirubin level greater than 222 mumol/L (13 mg/dL). Phototherapy was administered for 96 hours, and exchange transfusion was used to control hyperbilirubinemia at the same predetermined levels in both groups. Neurological and developmental examinations were conducted at 1 and 6 years of age, with follow-up rates of 83% and 62%, respectively. The two groups did not differ in mortality or diagnosed medical conditions. The phototherapy and control groups had similar rates of cerebral palsy (5.8% vs 5.9%), other motor abnormalities including clumsiness and hypotonia (11.1% vs 11.4%), and sensorineural hearing loss (1.8% vs 1.9%). The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised scores overall were not significantly different for the two groups (Verbal, 96.8 vs 94.8; Performance, 95.8 vs 95.1 for phototherapy and control groups, respectively). Phototherapy effectively controlled neonatal hyperbilirubinemia without evidence of adverse outcome at 6 years of age and was at least as effective as management with exchange transfusion alone.\r"

A 1989 national survey of the members of the American Academy of Pediatrics (n = 940), designed as a follow-up to similar studies conducted in 1978 and 1983, was an examination of the factors that influence pediatrician participation. Between 1978 and 1989: (1) basic participation (treating any Medicaid beneficiaries) declined to 77% from 85%; (2) limited participation (seeing only some Medicaid beneficiaries who request care) increased from 26% to 39.4%; and (3) extent of participation (the percentage of a pediatrician's patients who are Medicaid beneficiaries) increased from 15.7% to 19.4%. A dichotomous conceptualization of participation (restricted or unrestricted) was developed. By this definition, only 56% of pediatricians allowed comparable access to their practices for both Medicaid and private patients. Low reimbursement and slow payments discouraged participation. Medicaid reimbursement to pediatricians was approximately equal to their overhead costs. However, a high degree of willingness to care for Medicaid children remains if fees are increased to within 11% to 16% of the private market level. Policy options to enhance participation are discussed.\r"

The treatment group received intramuscular injections of vitamin E (dl-alpha-tocopherol) on days 1, 2, 4, and 6 of life. The control group received intramuscular injections of placebo on the same schedule. All neonates initially received oral vitamin E (100 mg/kg/day dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate), which was subsequently adjusted to keep serum levels at 0.5 to 3.5 mg/dL. Ultrasonographic examinations of the head were performed as possible on days 1, 5 to 7, and 12 to 14. Hemorrhage was defined as mild if less than or equal to grade II ICH, or severe if grade III or IV. No significant differences in neonatal or total hospital mortality between groups were found. However, all ICH, as well as severe ICH, were significantly less in the vitamin E-treated 501 to 750-g subgroup (all ICH: 60% vs 29%; severe ICH: 32% vs 4%). When survivors were analyzed separately, a significant decrease in severe ICH was seen in the vitamin E-treated neonates (25% vs 5%). Necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis did not occur more frequently in the neonates treated with intramuscular injections of vitamin E. Other than two cases of mild induration at injection sites, no deleterious side effects of treatment were identified. Vitamin E may have a role in the prevention of severe ICH in premature neonates weighing between 501 and 750 g.\r"

This organism is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in the United States. The cause of meningitis can be established more accurately than that of other forms of invasive bacterial disease because the isolation of the bacterium from the cerebrospinal fluid or blood and/or the detection of bacterial antigen can correctly attribute the infection to a specific bacterial agent and dictate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In children, more than 95% of all invasive diseases attributable to Haemophilus species, including septicemia, pneumonia, epiglottis, cellulitis, arthritis, osteomyelitis, and pericarditis, are due to H influenzae type b. It has been estimated that systemic disease caused by H influenzae type b occurs in approximately 1 in 200 children in the United States before the age of five. The case fatality rate for H influenzae type b meningitis is approximately 5%, and substantial morbidity has also been documented to result from central nervous system infection with this agent. Of surviving children reported in a 1969 paper, 40% had significant neurologic sequelae after meningitis. A more recent study demonstrated substantial neurologic improvement during the first few months after hospitalization, but at 1 year of age 8% of the children had neurologic or intellectual sequelae of their meningitis. Milder defects with an array of developmental problems have been reported in as many as one third to one half of all survivors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-five percent of systemic Haemophilus influenzae infections in childhood are caused by serotype b organisms. The high risk for mortality and serious sequelae and the increase in antibiotic resistance of H influenzae type b are strong arguments for vaccination. Incidences and age distribution of disease caused by H influenzae type b vary considerably among countries. Compiled data for meningitis show the highest incidences to be among Alaskan Eskimos, Navajo and White Mountain Indians, and aboriginals in Australia. High incidences coincide with a peak incidence in a younger age group. This differs from Finland, where 95% of the cases of disease caused by H influenzae type b occur in children older than 7 months of age. In general, incidences are low in industrial and high in nonindustrial areas. For example, in Gambia the highest age-specific incidence is at 4 to 5 months after birth (H.A.B., unpublished data, 1988). This implies that a vaccine and regimen similar to that used in Finland would not be as efficacious if used in Gambia because of differences in demographics and incidence. Vaccines that confer protection at 3 to 4 months of age are, therefore, strongly desired. Outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharides of H influenzae type b have been suggested as alternative vaccine candidates in conjugation with the capsular polysaccharide because they apparently can contribute to the virulence of H influenzae type b. The occurrence and immunogenicity of various outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharides among H influenzae type b in industrial and nonindustrial countries and their significance as epidemiologic markers for the spread of disease, the type of disease, the age of acquisition, and their association with antibiotic resistance will be reviewed in this article.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "There has been uncertainty and controversy about the protective efficacy of Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine almost since it first was licensed in the United States. This article will briefly review the available epidemiologic data about the protective efficacy of this vaccine in children with no recognized underlying illnesses. H influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine was licensed in the United States in April 1985, based on the results of a randomized clinical trial that was conducted in Finland. That study indicated that the vaccine's protective efficacy was 90% against invasive disease caused by H influenzae type b in children 18 to 71 months of age. Authorities recommended that all children receive the vaccine at 2 years of age and that it be administered to children up to the age of 60 months. The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee also recommended that children at increased risk (such as those who attend group day care) receive the vaccine at 18 months and again at 24 months of age because of its inconsistent immunogenicity when administered to 18-month-old children. Soon after its licensure, however, reports of vaccine failures began to appear. In some instances the vaccine failure could be attributed to an identifiable immune deficiency. However, Granoff et al reported 54 apparently normal children who had received the H influenzae type b polysaccharide vaccine but subsequently developed invasive disease caused by H influenzae type b. The majority of these children had normal serum concentrations of total immunoglobulins, IgG2, hemolytic complement, and antibody to tetanus toxoid (a T-cell-dependent antigen).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The importance of Haemophilus influenzae type b as the main cause of serious bacteremic infections in young children and the consequent need for preventive measures have been widely appreciated since the 1970s. The knowledge that serum antibodies to the polysaccharide capsule of H influenzae type b increase with age and correlate with resistance to this infection encouraged work toward a vaccine based on the H influenzae type b polysaccharide. Such a vaccine was used in 1974 in a field trial in Finland. Two important lessons were learned. First, vaccine-induced antibodies to the polyribosylribitol-phosphate (PRP) polysaccharide correlated with protection from disease caused by H influenzae type b, so that the serum anti-PRP concentration predicting protection could be estimated as 1 microgram/mL. Second, the vaccine was not effective in infancy; protection and serum antibody concentrations above 1 microgram/mL were not observed before 18 to 24 months of age. The poor immunogenicity of PRP in infancy has been observed in a large number of studies and is shared by other bacterial polysaccharides. Although the reason for this is not known, the most likely hypothesis associates poor immunizing ability in infancy with the \"T-independent\" nature of these polysaccharide antigens. Such antigens would be unable to stimulate T lymphocytes; therefore, immunity to them would depend exclusively on B cells and antibodies produced by them. If infants, by and large, lack B cells that could be stimulated directly by a polysaccharide antigen, they cannot respond to the polysaccharide vaccine. This hypothesis immediately suggests possibilities for improvement of the vaccine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence of infection with H influenzae type b in certain populations, such as Apache and Navajo Indians and Alaskan Eskimos, is 10 to 20 times higher than in the general US population. Another important feature of H influenzae type b infections in these populations is that more than 80% of the cases occur during the first year of life, with 35% to 45% occurring during the first 6 months. One of the currently licensed vaccines that contains the capsular polysaccharide of the H influenzae type b organism is not reliably immunogenic in infants younger than 18 months of age. A number of new H influenzae type b vaccines prepared by covalently coupling the H influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide with a protein carrier antigen are undergoing clinical evaluation. One of these conjugate vaccines was shown to be efficacious in preventing disease caused by H influenzae type b in Finnish infants when they were immunized at 3, 4, and 6 months of age. Unfortunately, in a recently concluded trial, the same vaccine was not found to be efficacious in preventing such disease in infants younger than 1 year of age among the Alaskan Eskimo population. We have evaluated an alternative approach for protecting high-risk infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a survey of 800 employees of a not-for-profit organization, respondents were asked to rate each barrier indicator on a 5-point Likert scale; the response rate was 70%. Exploratory factor analysis was used to explore the construct validity of the measure. Five factors were found: Provider-Consumer Relationship, Cost, Site-Related, Inconvenience, and Fear. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to refine the indicators for each factor category, producing a scale to measure perceived barriers to secondary preventive care.

Controlled hyperventilation is the mainstay in the treatment of increased ICP. Other therapies include barbiturate coma and the use of corticosteroids to reduce ICP.

Factors such as age, obesity, malnutrition, and macrovascular and microvascular disease may contribute to wound infection and delayed wound healing especially in the type II diabetic patient. In addition, hyperglycemia caused by decreased insulin availability and increased resistance to insulin can affect the cellular response to tissue injury. Studies of the immune cells necessary for wound healing, such as PMN leukocytes and fibroblasts, as well as studies of injured tissue suggest that there is a delayed response to injury and impaired functioning of immune cells in diabetes mellitus. There is evidence that these impairments may be the result of both an inherent (genetic) defect as well as decreased insulin availability and increased blood glucose concentration. At the time of hospital admission, little can be done to affect most of the risk factors or inherent cellular defects. However, blood glucose levels can be controlled with the use of bedside blood glucose monitoring and frequent adjustment of insulin dosing. Nurses have traditionally played an important role in monitoring recovery from surgery and watching for signs of infection and wound complications. These nursing functions are especially important in the diabetic patient. In addition, frequent evaluation of the effectiveness of insulin therapy is an important nursing function throughout the perioperative period. Through improving management of blood glucose levels in surgical patients, nurses can have a major impact on the incidence of wound complications in diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "The aged patient is more susceptible to wound healing problems because of the interactions of body systems, environmental stresses, and disease with an aging process that takes place over many years. The multifactorial nature of wound healing in the elderly makes it difficult to determine whether observed healing problems are attributable to results of aging or other factors. Healing is affected by multiple factors in addition to patient age, which itself is not a dependable indicator of physiologic health. Some of these factors are disease, nutrition, perfusion, skin quality, environment, and individual responses to life events. It is particularly difficult for the aged patient to sustain the motivation to participate in care required during the healing process when cascading problems are allowed to build on the decreasing functions and reserve capacities of aging body systems and deplete available energy levels. Assessment of each individual is required because of the wide variety of aging changes and healing responses seen in aged patients. Compared with a younger adult, the aged patient generally heals well, following the same healing process but at a slower rate. Wound healing for the aged can be optimized through techniques of energy conservation, correction of existing problems, and management of risks related to aging and the individual patient. Healing problems are usually the result of decreases in systemic and local perfusion, decreases in the ability to ward off infection, and fragility of aging skin. The aged patient requires the same care as younger patients. It is more critical that this care be meticulously delivered with particular attention to care of intact skin, effects of chronic disease and medications, motivation, social habits, and discharge planning. Nurses can promote improved healing through the care they provide and by studying the progression of healing in aged patients.\r"

Although some chest injuries are overt, some are not. The mechanism of injury is important for increasing the degree of suspicion used to identify covert injuries. The most lethal injuries include tension pneumothorax, sucking chest wound, massive hemothorax, flail chest, and cardiac tamponade. Cardiac and aortic ruptures often cause death before the victim enters the health care system. Potentially lethal injuries include myocardial and pulmonary contusion, tracheobronchial disruption, and esophageal disruption. Trauma victims present with many combinations of chest injuries. The care of these patients is very complex. Nursing diagnoses guide the care of chest trauma patients and can include impaired gas exchange, alteration in cardiac output, and altered breathing pattern. The goal of treatment is to restore and maintain stable hemodynamics with adequate respirations and circulation allowing definitive treatment for a positive patient outcome.\r"

  ".W": "After mixed infection, up to half of related retroviruses are recombinants. During infection, retroviral RNA genomes are first converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) and then to double-stranded DNA. Thus recombination could occur during reverse transcription, by RNA template switching, or after reverse transcription, by breakage and reunion of DNA. It has not been possible to distinguish between these two potential mechanisms of recombination because both single-stranded cDNA and double-stranded proviral DNA exist in infected cells during the eclipse period. Therefore we have analyzed for recombinant molecules among cDNA products transcribed in vitro from RNA of disrupted virions. Since recombinants from allelic parents can only be distinguished from parental genomes by point mutations, we have examined the cDNAs from virions with distinct genetic structures for recombinant-specific size and sequence markers. The parents share a common internal allele that allows homology-directed recombination, but each contains specific flanking sequences. One parent is a synthetically altered Harvey murine sarcoma virus RNA that lacks a retroviral 3' terminus but carries a Moloney murine retrovirus-derived envelope gene (env) fragment 3' of its transforming ras gene. The other parent is intact Moloney virus. Using a Harvey-specific 5' primer and a Moloney-specific 3' primer, we have found recombinant cDNAs with the polymerase chain reaction, proving directly that retroviruses can recombine during reverse transcription unassisted by cellular enzymes, probably by template switching during cDNA synthesis. The recombinants that were obtained in vitro were identical with those obtained in parallel experiments in vivo.\r"

Transformation was accomplished by introducing the cloned C. reinhardtii oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1 (OEE1) gene into C. reinhardtii cells by bombardment with DNA-coated tungsten particles. The recipient strain was an OEE1-deficient, nonphotosynthetic, acetate-requiring mutant, which recovered photosynthetic competence after transformation, and was therefore able to grow in the absence of acetate. Analysis of several transformants indicates that transformation has proceeded via second-site integration of the cloned gene, leaving the endogenous mutant gene intact. In genetic crosses of transformants with wild type, both mutant and wild-type phenotypes were recovered, showing that the photosynthetic competence of transformants was due not to reversion of the original locus but rather to expression of the introduced gene. We suggest that the success of the present system is largely due to using a homologous C. reinhardtii gene, leading to stable maintenance and expression of the gene. Transformation with heterologous genes may be problematic because of poor expression due to an unusual codon bias in C. reinhardtii.\r"

Here we report the use of a retroviral vector to test the potency of human MYC for neoplastic transformation in avian cells. We found that sustained and abundant expression of MYC can transform both embryonic fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells and elicit granulocytic leukemias in chickens. Transformation by MYC is accompanied by changes in diverse aspects of cellular phenotype, including morphology, ability to grow in suspension, rate of proliferation, the structure of the cytoskeleton, and the composition of the extracellular matrix. Nevertheless, the biological potency of MYC is inherently constrained when compared to that of the retroviral oncogene v-myc. Our findings enlarge on previous descriptions of neoplastic transformation by MYC and sustain the view that ungoverned expression of the gene can contribute to the genesis of human tumors.\r"

The purified yeast enzyme formed two-dimensional crystals on positively charged lipid layers, as previously found for Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme.

Most of these mutations replace positively charged amino acids in the region with neutral ones, although we also describe substitutions at one position that do not alter the charge of the region. Mutations of region I that alter the activation function in yeast have similar effects on activation when assayed in mammalian cells. When individual mutations that raise the acidity of the activating region are recombined, the activities of the mutant proteins increase with increasing negative charge in both yeast and mammalian cells. These results extend and modify the correlation between acidity and activation and suggest that the requirements for a strong activating region are conserved in yeast and mammals.\r"

(1980) Exp. Anim. (Tokyo) 29, 1-13]. We show that the genes for tumor necrosis factor alpha and granzyme A, a serine protease associated with cytoplasmic granules of cytotoxic cells, are expressed during the development of spontaneous diabetes mellitus in the nonobese diabetic mouse. Granzyme A-positive cells are found both in and surrounding the islets, implying induction prior to islet infiltration. Tumor necrosis factor alpha expression is exclusively observed in the intra-islet infiltrate, predominantly in lymphocytes adjacent to insulin-producing beta cells, the targets of the autoimmune destruction, implying that tumor necrosis factor alpha expression is induced locally--i.e., in the islet. A considerable portion of cells expressing tumor necrosis factor alpha appear to be CD4+ T cells. This T-cell subset was previously shown to be necessary for development of the disease. Thus, these findings may be important for understanding the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes mellitus and potentially also for that of other T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.\r"

The mouse peripheral lymph node homing receptor, defined by the MEL-14 monoclonal antibody (mAb), is a lectin-like cell surface protein, which is rapidly down-regulated upon cell activation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. We have raised mAbs against rapidly shed molecules released from the cell surface of activated human leukocytes. Five mAbs, DREG-55, -56, -110, -152, and -200, define an 80- to 85-kDa molecule involved in human lymphocyte recognition of peripheral lymph node (PLN) high endothelial venules (HEVs). The DREG-56 mAb specifically inhibits greater than 90% of binding of human lymphocytes to HEVs within frozen sections of peripheral but not mucosal lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, the gp80 antigen is expressed on lymphoid cell lines that are capable of binding to PLN HEVs. The DREG-56 mAb also inhibits lymphocyte binding of the phosphomannan monoester core from Hansenula hostii Y-2448, an activity associated with human and mouse lymphocyte recognition of PLN HEVs. Finally, all five DREG mAbs specifically stain COS cells transfected with LAM-1 cDNA, a putative human homologue of mouse MEL-14 antigen. These results demonstrate that the DREG mAbs define a human lymphocyte homing receptor for PLN HEVs and indicate that this human antigen is homologous to the MEL-14-defined murine lymphocyte homing receptor.\r"

Purified En, which is produced in Escherichia coli, binds not only to this consensus sequence but also to the TATA box of the Drosophila Hsp70 promoter and of other eukaryotic promoters. Interestingly, En represses transcription of these promoters in an in vitro-reconstituted mammalian transcription system and footprint analyses show that En competes with the TATA box-binding protein transcription factor IID for binding to the TATA box. In contrast, a stable template-committed complex formed by preincubation of transcription factor IID with the promoter is not disrupted by addition of En, and in this case transcription is not repressed. These in vitro studies suggest a transcriptional repression mechanism, involving competition between En and transcription factor IID for TATA box binding, that may be involved in En-mediated repression in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The cDNA encoding human cyclophilin from the Jurkat T-cell lymphoma line has been cloned by the expression cassette polymerase chain reaction and sequenced, and an expression vector has been constructed under control of the tac promoter for efficient expression in Escherichia coli. Active cyclophilin is produced at up to 40% of soluble cell protein, facilitating a one-column purification to homogeneity. Wild-type cyclophilin was characterized for binding of the potent immunosuppressant agent cyclosporin A (Kd = 46 nM) by tryptophan fluorescence enhancement and for inhibition (IC50 = 19 nM) of cyclophilin's peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (rotamase) activity. With N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide as the substrate, recombinant human cyclophilin has a high catalytic efficiency; kcat/Km is 1.4 X 10(7) M-1.S-1 at 10 degrees C. To test the prior suggestion that a cysteine residue may be essential for catalysis and immunosuppressant binding, the four cysteines at positions 52, 62, 115, and 161 were mutated individually to alanine and the purified mutant proteins were shown to retain full affinity for cyclosporin A and equivalent catalytic efficiency as a rotamase. Clearly the cysteines play no essential role in catalysis or cyclosporin A binding. These results rule out the recently proposed mechanism [Fischer, G., Wittmann-Liebold, B., Lang, K., Kiefhaber, T. & Schmid, F. X. (1989) Nature (London) 337, 476-478)] involving the formation of tetrahedral hemithioorthoamide. Whereas mechanisms that embody other tetrahedral intermediates may be operative, an alternative mechanism is considered that involves distortion of bound substrate with a twisted (90 degrees) peptidyl-prolyl amide bond.\r"

(1990) Biochemistry 29, 389-402] shows an interaction between Asp-236 of the catalytic chain and Lys-143 of the regulatory chain. Asp-236 is part of the loop containing residues 230-245 (240s) of the catalytic chain that undergoes a significant conformational change between the tight and the relaxed states of the enzyme. Furthermore, side-chain interactions between the 240s loop and other portions of the enzyme have been shown to be important for the low activity and low affinity of the tight state and the high activity and high affinity of the relaxed state. To determine whether the intersubunit link between Lys-143 of the regulatory chain and Asp-236 of the catalytic chain is important for either homotropic cooperativity and/or the heterotropic interactions in aspartate carbamoyltransferase, site-specific mutagenesis was used to replace Asp-236 with alanine. The mutant enzyme exhibits full activity and a loss of both homotropic cooperativity and heterotropic interactions. Furthermore, the aspartate concentration at half the maximal observed specific activity is reduced by approximately 8-fold. The mutant enzyme exhibits normal thermal stability but drastically altered reactivity toward p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The catalytic subunit of the mutant and wild-type enzymes have very similar properties. These results, in conjunction with previous experiments, suggest that the intersubunit link involving Asp-236 is involved in the stabilization of the 240s loop in its tight-state position and that the regulatory subunits exert their effect on the catalytic subunits by influencing the position of the 240s loop.\r"

  ".W": "T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity may play an important role in control of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this study, we have identified and characterized a relatively conserved epitope in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase recognized by murine and human cytotoxic T cells. This epitope was identified using a murine antigen-specific CD8+ class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) line, a transfected fibroblast cell line expressing the HIV-1 pol gene, recombinant vaccinia viruses containing different truncated versions of the pol gene, and overlapping synthetic peptides. The optimal antigenic site was identified as residues 203-219 by synthesizing extended or truncated peptide analogs of the antigenic fragment. The optimal peptide was then tested for sensitization of autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell targets for killing by fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It was recognized by CTLs from several HIV-seropositive patients but not from any seronegative donor. Therefore, this peptide is a good candidate for inclusion in an AIDS vaccine. This study demonstrates that the same CTL epitope can be seen by murine and human CD8+ CTLs, as previously demonstrated for epitopes recognized by CD4+ helper T cells, and suggests the utility of screening for immunodominant CTL epitopes in mice prior to carrying out studies in humans.\r"

  ".U": "90192806\r", 
  ".W": "In Xenopus oocytes injected with rat brain mRNA, as in neurons, glycine greatly potentiated responses of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of excitatory amino acid receptor. Injected oocytes generated a partially desensitizing inward current in response to NMDA with 30 nM added glycine. As the added glycine concentration was increased from 30 nM to 1 microM, the NMDA response was increased and exhibited less desensitization. The relationship between the NMDA peak response and added glycine concentration indicated a single component response with apparent affinity of 0.29 microM and a Hill coefficient of 0.77. The desensitized response was also fit by the Hill relation with a lower affinity but similar coefficient. The time course of desensitization at 500 microM NMDA was exponential with a time constant (350 msec) that was independent of glycine concentration between 0.03 and 0.3 microM. At higher glycine concentration a slower component of decay (tau = 1.4 sec) was observed. This component was enhanced by increasing the extracellular Ca2+. NMDA without added glycine evoked a small transient response. However this response was suppressed completely by prewashing with the glycine antagonist 7-chlorokynurenic acid, suggesting that it may have been due to glycine contamination. The dose-response relation for low concentrations of glycine indicated that the measured level of glycine contamination accounted for these responses. These results indicate that glycine has at least two actions at the NMDA receptor: it enables channel opening by the agonist and decreases desensitization.\r"

A glial role is favored by several observations: (i) mutant mice lacking neuronal Purkinje cells display normal ET receptor binding and enhanced stimulation by ET of inositolphospholipid turnover; (ii) in weaver mice lacking neuronal granule cells, ET stimulation of inositolphospholipid turnover is not significantly diminished; (iii) C6 glioma cells and primary cultures of cerebellar astroglia exhibit substantial ET receptor binding and ET-induced stimulation of inositolphospholipid turnover; (iv) ET promotes mitogenesis of C6 glioma cells and primary cerebellar astroglia; and (v) primary cultures of cerebellar astroglia contain ET mRNA. ET also appears to have a neuronal role, since it stimulates inositolphospholipid turnover in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells, and ET binding declines in granule cell-deficient mice. Thus, ET can be produced by glia and act upon both glia and neurons in a paracrine fashion.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 6 (IL-6) was established as a transcriptional inducer of the rat alpha 2-macroglobulin gene, a prototype liver acute-phase gene. Maximum induction occurred when the 5' flanking sequences of this gene (position -209 to -43) directed expression from the gene's own TATA box and transcription start site. Removal of the hexanucleotide CTGGGA (position -164 to -159) abolished 60-70% of the hormonal induction in FAO1 rat hepatoma cells. This hexanucleotide was defined as the IL-6 response element (IL-6-RE). The IL-6-RE is well conserved in the cytokine-responsive regions of other acute-phase genes and serves as a binding site for nuclear proteins. A characteristic DNA-protein complex (complex I) was formed with nuclear proteins from normal rat livers. A different, hormone-inducible complex (complex II) was assembled specifically with nuclear proteins from acute-phase rat livers or from IL-6-treated human Hep 3B hepatoma cells. Complex II was competitively inhibited by oligonucleotides representing the conserved IL-6-RE sequence from other acute-phase genes. Thus, the proteins building complex II likely participate in a general signal transduction mechanism mediating the transcriptional activation by IL-6 of several acute-phase genes.\r"

A review of the literature is used to outline and describe the characteristics of ILBPS and to make a case that these characteristics are consistent with those of a specific dysfunction of the SIJs. Functions of the intervertebral disks and the SIJs are described and related to SIJ dysfunction and to some of its common consequences. Treatment is discussed as it relates to the pathomechanics and their correction.\r"

Flow was measured with the TSI Laserflo BPM 403 in 27 healthy volunteers and compared to the flow in uncomplicated postoperative autologous tissue transplants. The forehead produced the highest flow, with an average value of 6.50 +/- 0.31 (mean +/- SE), and the dorsalis pedis had the lowest flow, with an average value of 0.60 +/- 0.04. Gender differences were noted in the latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major, and rectus abdominis areas. There were no significant differences between smokers and nonsmokers, hand dominance, musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous tissues, or supine and sitting body positions. Flow levels in volunteers were similar to those in postoperative surviving autologous tissue transplants. The site-specific flow and flow changes over long time periods (hours) have helped clinical monitoring of 77 patients in the last 24 months. In every case identified by the flowmeter as decreased perfusion, a definite etiology for low reduction was documented. Complications occurred in 12 patients, and the rate of salvaging compromised tissue has increased from 50 percent using temperature monitoring and clinical observation to 83 percent with the computerized laser Doppler flowmeter.\r"

In part I patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group A received a placebo capsule while Group B continued with treatment as before. After six months the response to treatment was assessed according to a scoring system. The overall relapse rate in Group B was 46 per cent compared to 82 per cent in group A. With continued treatment patients in Group B became asymptomatic from the fourth month while patients in Group A continued to deteriorate. In part II, patients who had relapsed whilst on placebo received active treatment. Six of the seven who agreed to continue with the study became asymptomatic within four weeks. However, all the patients who were asymptomatic while on active treatment relapsed on discontinuation and again recovered on reinstitution of active treatment. We conclude that irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic relapsing disorder and that treatment with a combination of ispaghula husk and propantheline is effective, both in relieving symptoms and in the maintenance of remission.\r"

A significant correlation was also found between ultrasound (US) findings in the neonatal period and outcome at 1 year (Chi 2 = 22.9, P = .03). To establish the criterion with the best predictive value, a multiple regression analysis was performed with periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and the stage of myelination at 44 weeks PMA as independent variables and neurodevelopmental outcome at 1 year of age as a dependent variable. Staging of myelination with MR imaging in the early postnatal period of very preterm infants had predictive value with regard to neurodevelopmental outcome. Detection of PVL with US, however, showed a better correlation with outcome, a result that seems to limit the potential role of MR imaging in this population for this purpose only.\r"

The sonograms, CT scans, and chest radiographs of 182 patients were interpreted blindly by three observers, and the results were compared. The proportion of diagnostic sonographic examinations varied for the different mediastinal compartments from 85% (subcarinal region) to 96% (supraaortic region). The sensitivities of sonography and chest radiography, respectively, for each compartment, with CT as the reference method, were as follows: supraaortic region, 98% and 67%; paratracheal region, 89% and 69%; aorticopulmonary window, 81% and 62%; prevascular region, 92% and 46%; subcarinal region, 69% and 31%; pericardial region, 100% and 67%; posterior mediastinum, 6% and 6%; and paravertebral region, 11% and 44%. These results show that sonography is superior to chest radiography in the diagnosis of mediastinal tumors. In certain mediastinal regions (supraaortic, pericardial, prevascular, and paratracheal), sonography is so sensitive that CT and magnetic resonance examinations may be obviated in patients with equivocal radiographic findings.\r"

In this short span, ultrasonography has been applied to nearly all specialties of medicine. It is now an indispensable adjunct to diagnosis, and in some areas, such as obstetrics, modern practitioners could not function without it. It is estimated that by the year 1991, 25% of all imaging studies (worldwide) will be sonograms. While such widespread use invariably leads to turf and training problems, the end result has been very positive for patients.\r"

Close correlation between the US images and actual anatomic specimens was obtained. Structures outside of the lumen were identified and confirmed with both direct visualization and radiographic localization. Two small stones artificially inserted into the renal pelvis and a polyp-like projection artificially created within the fallopian tube were clearly identified by using the US probe.

The potential advantages and existing liabilities of percutaneous intravascular US as an adjunct to transluminal vascular recanalization were investigated. A 6.6-F braided, polyethylene catheter enclosing a rotary drive shaft with a single-element, 20-MHz transducer at the distal tip was used in 17 patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal (balloon) angioplasty (PTA) alone (10 patients), PTA with implantation of an endovascular stent (two patients), atherectomy alone (two patients), or laser angioplasty with PTA and/or atherectomy (three patients). The arteries treated and examined included the common iliac in five patients, the external iliac in two, the superficial femoral in nine, and a vein graft-arterial anastomosis in one. In 14 cases PTA was employed as sole or adjunctive therapy; plaque cracks were clearly delineated with intravascular US in all 14 (100%) and dissections were observed in 11 (78%). Plaque-arterial wall disruption was less prominent in the arteries treated with mechanical atherectomy. The results of laser angioplasty reflected the adjunctive modality employed. After stent implantation, serial intravascular US documented effacement of PTA-induced plaque cracks and/or dissections. Intravascular US also aided in the quantitative assessment of luminal cross-sectional areas after the procedures (19.0-51.8 mm2). The observations recorded in this preliminary group of 17 patients illustrate the potential utility of intravascular US as an adjunct to conventional angiography in patients undergoing percutaneous revascularization.\r"

  ".W": "In this report we have emphasized the significant influence of loading conditions on LV relaxation. Changes in inotropic state, ischemia, hypertrophy, and a host of other factors were not discussed herein. Ventricular asynchrony is likewise beyond the scope of this review, but it should be recognized that complex loading interactions among fibers within the LV wall influence relaxation and filling in ventricles that contract and relax nonsynchronously. Intact heart and isolated muscle experiments indicate that changes in preload do not influence relaxation rates when systolic pressure or total load remains constant. It appears, therefore, that the relaxation changes that occur with volume loading are primarily due to changes in systolic pressure or load. Indeed, an increase in systolic pressure may cause a substantial decrease in isovolumic relaxation rate, especially if there is a slow rise and a late peak in LV pressure. By contrast, an abrupt increase in late systolic load augments relaxation rate. Intact heart studies indicate that an abrupt load increment near the end of ejection results in premature and more rapid isovolumic relaxation, while an increase in left atrial pressure increases the filling rate; isolated muscle studies indicate that a load increment at the end of isometric relaxation causes an increase in isotonic relaxation rate. Thus, loading conditions during the periods of ejection, isovolumic relaxation, and filling can influence relaxation parameters and should be considered in clinical and experimental studies of LV relaxation.\r"

Alcohol probably exerts its effects by a direct action of ethanol in the blood on the myocardium, while the postprandial hemodynamic changes are related to the effects of food in the intestine. Alcohol intoxication causes a dose-dependent impairment of LV emptying at rest, whereas compensatory mechanisms other than an increased sympathetic nervous activity counterbalance this effect during exercise. In patients with coronary artery disease, alcohol induces only small changes in LV volumes at rest, possibly because of a concomitant vasodilation. Food intake seems to have a considerable influence on central hemodynamics leading to an increase in cardiac output both in healthy subjects and in patients with coronary artery disease. In healthy subjects an increase is recorded in the LVEDV and LVESV after a meal. The autonomic nervous system is probably responsible for most of the hemodynamic changes.\r"

They are found in most genes encoding messenger RNAs, but are lacking in almost all small nuclear (sn)RNAs. One exceptional snRNA (U6) is part of the spliceosomal machinery that is involved in messenger RNA maturation. It has been suggested that its intron arose as a result of incorrect splicing of a messenger RNA precursor. This study revealed the presence of an intron, with the characteristic features of nuclear introns from precursors to messenger RNA, in the two genes coding for Saccharomyces cerevisiae U3 snRNA. The branch point was GACTAAC instead of the TACTAAC sequence found in all yeast introns examined so far. As U3 is a nucleolar snRNA required for maturation of ribosomal RNA, its intron could not have been acquired from aberrant messenger RNA processing in a spliceosome.\r"

Productive infection by HIV-1 was shown to result in a significant decrease in the amount of cellular p68 kinase. The steady-state amount of p68 kinase was also reduced in interferon-treated HeLa cell lines stably expressing tat, as compared to the amount of the kinase in interferon-treated control HeLa cells. Thus, the potential translational inhibitory effects of the TAR RNA region mediated by activation of p68 kinase may be downregulated by tat during productive HIV-1 infection.\r"

Selectivity changes were observed at 14 sites distributed throughout the length of the molecule. These sites are likely to define the position of the protein walls lining the aqueous pore and hence, the transmembrane segments. These results have been used to develop a model of the open state of the channel in which each polypeptide contributes 12 beta strands and one alpha helix to form the aqueous transmembrane pathway.\r"

Final diagnoses included extrahepatic biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis, cystic fibrosis, metabolic liver disease, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, bile duct stenosis, Alagille syndrome (arteriohepatic dysplasia), choledochal cyst, panhypopituitarism, and miscellaneous causes of intrahepatic cholestasis. A single diagnostic criterion is insufficient to distinguish the various causes of neonatal jaundice. Clinical laboratory values varied widely among patients with medical and surgical causes of jaundice. Absence of stool pigmentation was not specific for biliary atresia and was found in patients with medical causes of jaundice. Conversely, two patients with biliary atresia had pigmented stools at presentation. Ultrasonography was diagnostic only for choledochal cyst and bile duct stenosis. Nonvisualization of the gallbladder by either ultrasonography or nuclear hepatobiliary scintigraphy was nonspecific in the discrimination of medical from surgical causes of jaundice. A multidisciplinary approach to the evaluation of neonatal jaundice is necessary, since no single test or imaging modality can reliably define the cause in all cases.\r"

A baboon model was used to evaluate the feasibility of a direct surgical reconstruction via a transoral-transclival approach, utilizing temporary occlusion of the basilar artery. An arteriotomy was performed and either repaired primarily or a venous patch graft was sutured in place. All animals survived the surgery; one suffered fatal postoperative upper airway obstruction, but the other four were neurologically intact at the time of death. Patency at the site of repair was confirmed both angiographically and histologically. We conclude that temporary clamping in conjunction with direct reconstruction of the basilar artery is feasible in this primate model. Future studies will focus on further applications of this technique.\r"

One hundred and seven patients completed the study. Response was assessed as change in FEV1 and FVC measured on the last treatment day, and as change in mean peak expiratory flow (PEF) over the final seven days of treatment from home PEF recordings performed five times daily. A full response to treatment was defined as an increase in FEV or FVC, or an increase in mean daily PEF over the final seven days of treatment, of at least 20% from baseline values. An improvement in one measurement of at least 15%, or of 10% in any two measurements, was defined as a partial treatment response. Response to placebo showed a significant order effect, suggesting a carry over effect of active treatment of at least three weeks. Response to active treatment was therefore related to initial baseline values, and compared with placebo by considering responses in the first treatment phase only. A full response to oral prednisolone (16/38) was significantly more common than to placebo (3/35). The number of full responses to inhaled beclomethasone (8/34) did not differ significantly from the number responding to oral prednisolone or placebo in the first treatment phase, though full and partial responses to inhaled beclomethasone (12/34) were significantly more common than those to placebo (4/35). When all three treatment phases were considered 44/107 patients showed a full response to one or both forms of corticosteroid treatment, a response to prednisolone (39) occurring more frequently than to inhaled beclomethasone (26). Only 21 of the 44 responders showed a response to both forms of treatment. Inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate 500 micrograms thrice daily was inferior to oral prednisolone 40 mg per day, but better than placebo, in producing improvement in physiological measurements in patients thought to have nonasthmatic chronic airflow obstruction. It was, however, an effective alternative in over half of those showing a response to prednisolone.\r"

The time course of response was analysed for the 57 occasions where there was a significant increase in mean daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) over the treatment period. Mean daily PEF was still rising at day 14 on 12 occasions. After withdrawal of treatment mean daily PEF remained above pretreatments levels for more than two weeks in half the responses analysed. The peak response occurred earlier with inhaled beclomethasone (median 9.5 (range 3-14) days) than with oral prednisolone (median 12 (range 1-14) days), though both treatments produced a response that was sustained for a similar period. The results suggest that a trial of treatment with corticosteroids in this group of patients should last more than 14 days, and that in a study with a crossover design the washout period should be longer than two weeks.\r"

Five were identified by computed tomography alone, including two in whom disease was revealed in segments underfilled at bronchography. The sensitivity of computed tomography compared with bronchography in the diagnosis of bronchiectasis at segmental level was 84% and the specificity 82%. The predictive value of computed tomography in the diagnosis of bronchiectasis was 38% overall, but increased to 75% when only those segmental bronchi moderately or severely dilated on the computed tomography scan were considered. There was no relation between the degree of bronchial wall thickening on the computed tomogram and the diagnosis of bronchiectasis by bronchography. Bronchography may be avoided in patients being considered for surgical resection of their bronchiectasis in whom computed tomography shows diffuse disease.\r"

In a randomized double-blind design, 99 women, aged 18 to 40, were given placebo or low-dose carbonyl iron (100 mg orally) at bedtime for 56 days after phlebotomy. Compliance was equivalent for the two regimens. Mild side effects were slightly greater with carbonyl iron. At Day 56, estimated net iron absorption from therapy or diet, or both, was sufficient to replace iron in 85 percent of those receiving carbonyl iron but in only 29 percent of those taking placebo (p less than 0.001). The rates of deferral from repeat donation were 8 percent in the carbonyl iron group and 36 percent in the placebo group (p less than 0.01), and the positive predictive value of routine screening in identifying participants without iron deficiency was 83 versus 13 percent (p less than 0.01). It can be concluded that short-term carbonyl iron supplementation in female blood donors can replace the iron lost at phlebotomy, protect the women against iron deficiency, and enhance their ability to give blood.\r"

There are few data implicating other cephalosporins in causing nephrotoxicity. Cefazolin, which is nephrotoxic in animals, has not been reported to produce nephrotoxicity in humans. Two studies have documented nephrotoxicity due to ceftazidime, especially in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Such patients should have their dosage adjusted to minimize ceftazidime-induced renal impairment. Finally, cephalosporins other than cephaloridine and cephalothin have not been documented to increase the risk of nephrotoxicity when used in combination with aminoglycosides compared with aminoglycosides alone.\r"

This review critically examines the definitions used to establish the diagnosis of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity and the clinical significance of these adverse reactions. The review also focuses on the practical and economic issues surrounding therapeutic drug monitoring practices. We conclude that aminoglycoside antibiotics remain an effective and economical form of therapy for severe infections and that if careful criteria are used in the selection of these agents, the benefits of therapy outweigh the risk of toxicity.\r"

Such problems as lack of standard definitions for early and late PTE, the retrospective design of most studies, the wide variability of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the varied duration of follow-up make this body of literature extremely difficult to evaluate. Severe head trauma appears to cause injured neurons to become hyperexcitable; this in turn brings about the formation of an epileptogenic focus during the time between trauma and seizure occurrence. Both military and civilian head injury populations have been used to evaluate the incidence of PTE. Early seizures (i.e., less than 7 days) occur in approximately 3-5 percent of the head injury patients in both the military and civilian groups. Factors increasing this incidence include intracranial hematoma, focal neurologic deficits, posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) lasting greater than 24 hours, depressed skull fracture, and age less than 5 years. The incidence of late seizures is directly related to the extent of brain damage. The military population, composed primarily of cases with penetrating head injury, is associated with a late PTE incidence of approximately 30-50 percent. Closed head injuries in the military population involve a 5-15 percent seizure incidence. Late PTE incidence after head injuries in the civilian population is less than 5 percent. Risk factors associated with late PTE include loss of consciousness or PTA lasting greater than 24 hours, dural lacerations, depressed skull fractures, and various computerized tomography deficits. These factors vary slightly between the military and civilian populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Experimentally, cimetidine, an H2-receptor antagonist, has been shown to enhance a variety of immunologic functions both in vivo and in vitro because of its inhibitory effects on suppressor-cell function. Successful tumor immunotherapy, as well as some protection from infection, has been reported in experimental animals. Patients receiving cimetidine have been shown to exhibit enhanced cell-mediated immunity as evaluated by increased response to skin-test antigens, restoration of sensitivity following development of acquired tolerance, and increased responses of lymphocytes to mitogen stimulation. Preliminary reports also indicate that cimetidine may offer therapeutic benefits for patients with Varicella zoster and Herpes simplex infections, as well as those suffering from mucocutaneous candidiasis and common variable hypogammaglobulinemia. These immunoregulatory effects are dose-related but are not always consistent. Because of its inhibitory effect on suppressor function, cimetidine treatment may be deleterious in patients with organ transplant and autoimmune disorders. Cimetidine should be used as an immunomodulator on an experimental basis only.\r"

Forty-eight men (39%) had echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy defined as an LV mass index greater than 134 g/m2 and this finding was not related to the presence of LV hypertrophy on electrocardiogram or to age. Men who had echocardiographic LV hypertrophy were more likely than men without echocardiographic LV hypertrophy to have greater than or equal to 30 ventricular premature complexes (VPCs)/hr (odds ratio = 2.7; 95% confidence interval = 0.9, 8.0), multiform extrasystoles (odds ratio = 1.7; confidence interval = 0.8, 3.7), episodes of ventricular tachycardia (odds ratio = 2.3; confidence interval = 0.7, 7.1) and the combination of frequent (greater than or equal to 30 VPCs/hr) or complex (ventricular couplets, multiform extrasystoles or episodes of ventricular tachycardia) ventricular arrhythmia (odds ratio = 1.7; confidence interval = 0.8, 3.5). Similar associations between echocardiographic LV hypertrophy and ventricular arrhythmias were observed on 24-hour tracings obtained on entry to the study (before electrolyte repletion) in the 96 men who were taking diuretics at this time.

Researchers generally agree that early prevention depends on the elimination or treatment of known risk factors, among which hyperlipidemia occupies a central position. Two European Consensus Conferences have concluded that therapy of hyperlipidemia should always start with dietary counseling. First, subjects with body mass indexes (weight/height) greater than 27 should lose weight. Second, the lipid-lowering diet should provide 55% of calories from carbohydrates; 10 to 15% from protein; and up to 30% from fat comprising 10% each of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids; less than 300 mg/day cholesterol; 35 g/day of fiber derived largely from legumes and other vegetables; and fruit. Further reduction of fat consumption (to 20 to 25% of total energy) and of cholesterol (to less than 150 mg/day) may be attempted when patients respond inadequately to the standard diet. The goal of treatment is to minimize the risk of coronary artery disease and of pancreatitis. Where possible, a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 135 mg/dl (3.5 mmol/liter) should be the goal in hypercholesterolemic patients with multiple or severe risk factors and a level of 155 mg/dl (4 mmol/liter) in the absence of other risk factors. Also, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol greater than 35 mg/dl and triglycerides less than 200 mg/dl are considered important goals of treatment. Some patients with hyperlipidemia do not respond adequately to diet and correction of underlying causes; drug treatment should then be instituted, but careful attention to diet should be continued.\r"

As of June 1989, 744 patients had received lovastatin for an average duration of 3.6 years in the long-term study. Drug-attributable adverse events necessitated withdrawal of 17 patients (2.3%) from the study. These adverse effects were asymptomatic elevations of transaminases (10), skin rash (3), gastrointestinal symptoms (2), myopathy (1) and insomnia (1). No effect of lovastatin on the human lens was observed. In the 48-week study, 8,245 patients were randomized into 5 equal groups to receive placebo or lovastatin 20 or 40 mg once or twice daily on a double-blind basis. Only 3 cases of myopathy were observed, all in patients taking lovastatin 40 mg twice daily. The incidence of withdrawal from the study because of raised transaminases was approximately 0.1% in the placebo group vs 0.1, 0.7, 0.6 and 1.5% in patients taking lovastatin in doses of 20 mg once daily, 40 mg once daily, 20 mg twice daily and 40 mg twice daily, respectively. Lovastatin has been available in the United States since September 1987. By June 1989, the drug had been prescribed for approximately 1 million patients. Drug-attributable adverse events not observed in clinical trials (such as hypersensitivity reactions and symptomatic hepatitis) have been reported, but the incidence of each appears to be extremely low.\r"

Little direct evidence was available until researchers demonstrated that rather advanced atherosclerotic lesions in experimental animals could show marked improvement after blood-lipid-reducing regimens that were often combined with other measures, such as increased ambient oxygen and estradiol therapy. In fact, this combination was used in this laboratory to produce one of the first effective regression studies in the rabbit model. In more recent studies in this laboratory, abundant evidence has been obtained that the advanced, eccentric, largely intimal lesions produced in the rhesus monkey are substantially reversible, and the much more inflammatory, concentric, and often transmural atheroarteritis induced by the same atherogenic ration in the cynomolgus monkeys is much more resistant to effective and beneficial regression. This unusual reaction appears to be due to the circulating immune complexes that participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in these cynomolgus monkeys, as well as possibly in a number of humans. The evidence for this phenomenon, as well as the varying effects of the lesions induced with contrasting food fats, is summarized in this presentation. Some of the time-related effects of varying interventions when the lesions are studied at 4-month intervals in rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys are also discussed. Other factors that may influence regression are also considered.\r"

Total cholesterol levels greater than 240 mg/dl are considered \"high,\" those from 200 to 239 mg/dl \"borderline,\" and those less than 200 mg/dl \"normal,\" regardless of the person's age or gender. All persons in the high category, as well as those in the borderline category who have other risk factors or established vascular disease, require measurements of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. LDL cholesterol levels are used to guide the selection of treatment. Patients with LDL cholesterol levels greater than 130 mg/dl are candidates for active diet therapy. Those whose LDL cholesterol levels are 160 to 190 mg/dl after 3 to 6 months of diet therapy are candidates for drug therapy. A high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level less than 35 mg/dl is considered a risk factor and may influence the level of LDL at which drug therapy is initiated. Some observers have expressed concern that these guidelines overemphasize LDL cholesterol at the expense of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Nevertheless, the guidelines have been broadly accepted and currently serve as the basis for a widespread public-health education program.\r"

The authors have found that the alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method is sensitive and reliable. Murine monoclonal or nonmurine polyclonal antibodies can be used to label a variety of membranous and/or cellular constituents in tissues that have been routinely processed in a histopathology laboratory. The monoclonal antibody against leukocyte common antigen (CD45) can be used to differentiate hematologic from nonhematologic tumors. Monoclonal antibodies (L26, LN1, LN2, LN3, MB1, MB2) label B-cell lymphomas, whereas other monoclonal antibodies (UCHL1, MT1) more characteristically stain T-cell lymphomas. Polyclonal antibodies against CD3 specifically mark neoplastic cells from T-cell lymphomas and leukemias but as yet are not commercially available. Monoclonal antibodies Leu-M1 (CD15), Ber H2 (Ki-1; CD30), and LN2 label Reed-Sternberg cells from most cases of nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity, and lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin's disease. Monoclonal antibodies Mac 387, KP1 (CD68), and NP57 (antielastase), as well as polyclonal antibodies against lysozyme, help identify subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia and extramedullary myeloid cell tumors. Although there are now excellent reagents ready for use, there is still a significant need for more lineage-specific (particularly against CD epitopes) monoclonal antibodies capable of labeling neoplastic cells in paraffin-embedded tissue sections from patients with hematologic malignancies.\r"

Because these assays are being conducted to support diagnoses or assist in determining therapy, it is crucial to ensure that these tests are highly accurate and reproducible within a laboratory and among laboratories involved in similar endeavors. This quality assurance has been slow evolving in clinical flow cytometry for a variety of reasons: the exquisite sensitivity and delicacy of the instrumentation that recognize previously undetectable variations in staining; the constant improvement of the hardware and software; the rapid development of new techniques and reagents of clinical interest; and the failure of any existing specialty or subspecialty to encompass all aspects of flow cytometry. This article provides an overview of quality assurance necessary for the flow cytometric analysis of cell surface markers. Practical experience, published studies, and suggested guidelines from accreditation agencies have been combined to develop the text.\r"

Petit, a surgeon, recognized in the 1730s that clotting was hemostatically important in amputations. Finally, the mechanism of clotting began to be studied by Buchanan (1838), who recognized thrombin; Hammarsten (1875), who purified fibrinogen; and Arthus (1890), who discovered the need for calcium. The fact that platelets existed and had a hemostatic function was developed in the 1800s. Not until the late 1940s did the explosion in the discovery of new clotting factors begin; they now number up to Factor XIII, plus many more that have no Roman numeral designation. Discovery of clotting factors led to their assays. The use of whole blood clotting times was improved by measuring the clotting times of plasma. This was followed by the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). The prothrombin time became an important laboratory test. Specific factors were assayed by progressively more specific tests. These included elements of the fibrinolytic and inhibitory systems. Platelets were counted and their functions measured by bleeding times, clot retraction, adhesion, and aggregation. The diagnosis of hemostatic disorders has improved in parallel with the discoveries of new factors and the development of their precise assays.\r"

However, certain limitations became evident as monoclonal antibodies were increasingly applied to diagnostic hematologic problems. The T-cell antigens identified by monoclonal antibodies are not true clonal markers. B-cell immunoglobulin light chain restriction is a true clonal marker, but immunoglobulin is not expressed by many B-cell malignancies, diminishing its usefulness as a clonal marker. The development of molecular biologic techniques to augment diagnosis of hematologic neoplasms has revolutionized the understanding of neoplasia. Gene rearrangement analysis yields information concerning clonality and lineage. Gene rearrangement analysis can also identify chromosome breakpoints and translocations that correlate with specific diseases or prognoses. The purpose of this review is to familiarize the reader with the current applications of molecular biology to hematologic processes and to chart future directions of the application of these powerful techniques to diagnostic hematopathology.\r"

The process consists of repetitive cycles of specific DNA synthesis, defined by short stretches of preselected DNA. With each cycle, there is a doubling of the final, desired DNA product such that a million-fold amplification is possible. This powerful method has numerous applications in diagnostic pathology, especially in the fields of microbiology, forensic science, and hematology. The PCR may be used to directly detect viral DNA, which may facilitate the diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or other viral diseases. PCR amplification of DNA allows detection of specific sequences from extremely small samples, such as with forensic material. In hematology, PCR may help in the diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies or of neoplastic disorders by documenting chromosomal translocations. The new PCR opens exciting new avenues for diagnostic pathology using this new technology.\r"

Inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, the etiology and pathogenesis of the Marfan syndrome are presently unknown. We have documented consistent apparent deficient content of elastin-associated microfibrillar fibers by indirect immunofluorescent (IF) studies of Marfan skin, as well as deficient accumulation of related fibrous materials in cultures of Marfan fibroblasts as compared with normal controls and patients with other heritable disorders of connective tissue. These data have suggested that abnormalities in the microfibrillar component of elastic-fiber systems may have a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of the Marfan syndrome. In the present study, we have analyzed the IF staining patterns of skin and fibroblast cultures from Marfan syndrome patients and normal first-degree relatives in nine Marfan kindreds. Three of these families had at least one affected individual in each of 2 generations, permitting intergenerational comparison of IF patterns. Six kindreds had one or more affected individuals in a single generation, making comparisons between siblings and/or parent-child possible. In all cases, IF abnormalities cosegregated with the Marfan phenotype and all nonaffected family members were normal. Within family groups containing more than one affected individual, the IF staining patterns were similar between affected patients. These data provide further confirmation of consistent and relatively specific deficiency of microfibrillar fibers in Marfan syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The Marfan syndrome is a dominantly inherited connective-tissue disorder characterized by ocular, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal abnormalities. Although the underlying biochemical and molecular defect(s) of this pleiotropic disease is currently unknown, we have consistently observed apparent diminished content of elastin-associated microfibrillar fibers accumulating in skin, or produced by cultured fibroblasts, from patients with the Marfan syndrome and have documented the cosegregation of these immunofluorescent abnormalities of microfibrillar fibers with the Marfan syndrome phenotype in family studies. Recently, an unusual patient has been described with unilateral phenotypic features of the Marfan syndrome, providing an unique opportunity to compare microfibrillar fibers and other connective-tissue components between the affected and nonaffected sides. In the present report, we demonstrate striking differences in apparent content of microfibrillar fibers, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence of skin and fibroblast cultures, that are revealed when multiple homologous samples derived from different sides of the patient's body are compared. In contrast, no differences in apparent content of type III collagen or in the biosynthesis and apparent structure of types I and III (pro)collagens were found. HLA types and chromosome heteromorphisms were identical in fibroblasts from both sides of the body, eliminating the formal possibility of chimerism and suggesting that a postzygotic mutation accounts for the asymmetric manifestation of the Marfan syndrome in this patient. The observation of striking decreases in microfibrillar fibers on the affected side of the body provides further evidence that abnormalities of this component of the elastic fiber system may be central to the pathogenesis and possibly the etiology of the Marfan syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "One of female MZ twins presented with muscular dystrophy. Physical examination, creatine phosphokinase levels, and muscle biopsy were consistent with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, because of her sex she was diagnosed as having limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. With cDNA probes to the DMD gene, a gene deletion was detected in the twins and their mother. The de novo mutation which arose in the mother was shown by novel junction fragments generated by HindIII, PstI, or TaqI when probed with cDNA8. Additional evidence of a large gene deletion was given by novel SfiI junction fragments detected by probes p20, J-Bir, and J-66 on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Immunoblot analysis of muscle from the affected twin showed dystrophin of normal size but of reduced amount. Immunofluorescent visualization of dystrophin revealed foci of dystrophin-positive fibers adjacent to foci of dystrophin-negative fibers. These data indicate that the affected twin is a manifesting carrier of an abnormal DMD gene, her myopathy being a direct result of underexpression of dystrophin. Cytogenetic analysis revealed normal karyotypes, eliminating the possibility of a translocation affecting DMD gene function. Both linkage analysis and DNA fingerprint analysis revealed that each twin has two different X chromosomes, eliminating the possibility of uniparental disomy as a mechanism for DMD expression. On the basis of methylation differences of the paternal and maternal X chromosomes in these MZ twins, we propose uneven lyonization (X chromosome inactivation) as the underlying mechanism for disease expression in the affected female.\r"

This YAC clone appears to contain a faithful copy of this genomic region, as shown by comparison with human DNA and with a cosmid clone that contains probes St14c (part of the DXS52 sequences) and cpX67 (DXS134). cpX67 and St14c are contained in 11 kb and detect the same MspI RFLP polymorphism. A comparison of the YAC restriction map and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data leads us to propose the following order of loci: DXS52(VNTR)-DXS33-DXF22S3-DXS130-DXS134 -DXS52-DXS15-DXS52, this whole cluster being comprised within 575 kb. The physical proximity of the DXS15, DXS52, and DXS134 loci led us to reinvestigate recombination events that had been reported between these loci in families from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain. Our results do not support the assumption that this region shows increased recombination.\r"

One probable recombinant would confine the telomeric candidate location for the gene to the region covered by the YAC, which makes it possible that the clone described here contains the HD locus in its mutant form.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of high blood pressure in black people is often complicated by a variety of factors. These include the tendency of black hypertensive patients to have three to five times the cardiovascular mortality of white hypertensive patients, black hypertensives' more frequent progression to end-organ damage and stroke, and socioeconomic conditions that impede access to proper health care. In addition, blacks have a unique hemodynamic profile, one that alters the efficacy of many antihypertensive drugs. In black hypertensives, for example, diuretics are more effective than they are in whites, whereas beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are less effective. Although it is true that blacks are disproportionately represented in the hypertensive population--having up to seven times the prevalence of severe hypertension seen in whites--it is not true that they are relatively unresponsive to drug therapy. A number of long-term clinical trials have established that black hypertensives respond well to treatment. Specifically, blacks in stepped-care therapy achieve goal blood pressure at the same rate as their white counterparts, although the increased barriers to blood pressure control in blacks require practitioners to put increased effort into this therapy. Possibly because black hypertensives tend to have low plasma renin levels, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are not nearly as effective as diuretics when used as monotherapy. Diuretics, on the other hand, have established efficacy in blacks, and their selection for initial monotherapy is favored for two additional reasons. First, they present a better profile in terms of overall cost and compliance, thanks to their lower relative cost and once-a-day dosing. Second, when diuretics are combined with another antihypertensive therapy, such as an ACE inhibitor or a calcium-entry blocker, responsiveness may be further improved. This combination therapy may be especially important in black hypertensives, who exhibit a higher incidence of concurrent diseases such as left ventricular hypertrophy and congestive heart failure.\r"

Studies have established that the blood pressure-lowering effects of thiazide diuretics and calcium entry blockers or converting enzyme inhibitors. When these latter agents are added to a diuretic, however, a good blood pressure response is achieved.

One of the major modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease, hypertension, is a leading cause of stroke, kidney disease, and diseases of the heart and coronary circulation. Essential hypertension is the most common cause of systemic blood pressure elevation and it responds readily to both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment. More patients visit physicians and receive prescriptions for the treatment of hypertension than for any other medical disorder. Nevertheless, more than a million Americans die each year from the direct or indirect effects of hypertension. Over the last two decades, significant progress has been made in reducing mortality from cardiovascular disease. Through public health programs like the National High Blood Pressure Education Program, increasing numbers of hypertensive patients have been detected, treated and controlled. As a result, the number of deaths from stroke, kidney disease, and coronary artery disease has declined significantly. For both blacks and Hispanics, however, the decreases in cardiovascular mortality have been less striking. Many factors could account for this disparity, among them the availability of health care facilities in minority neighborhoods, and the health-care-seeking behavior of the patients themselves. Understanding epidemiologic and pathophysiologic data regarding differences between blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites will help reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality.\r"

Several factors, including the underlying health of the patient, criteria used to define nephrotoxicity, and the specific aminoglycoside administered, may contribute to the nephrotoxic potential of these agents. The development of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity is a complex problem. These drugs appear to be only minimally metabolized within the body and undergo nearly exclusive renal excretion, primarily by glomerular filtration. Ultimately, reabsorption and accumulation within the kidney results in proximal tubular cell damage; several possible mechanisms have been proposed, both for the development of such cell damage and for its subsequent role in the evolution of nephrotoxicity. The pathology and the clinical pattern of aminoglycoside-induced kidney damage have been extensively studied in animal models and in humans. Although the data often conflict, many of these studies have attempted to identify some of the factors associated with a higher risk for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. Of the factors generally agreed upon to influence risk, correction of volume depletion and diminished renal perfusion, as well as dose adjustment for level of renal function, have been identified as critical measures for prevention of renal damage by aminoglycosides. Recent studies have indicated that newer agents, such as third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam, often may be as therapeutic and cost-effective as the aminoglycosides without the nephrotoxicity associated with the latter agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Aztreonam, the first monobactam, has been used extensively in the treatment of a variety of infections caused by gram-negative pathogens. It has been shown to be highly effective against susceptible bacteria without causing serious adverse reactions. Its pharmacologic profile can be attributed to its unique chemical properties and mechanisms of action, which differ substantially from those of the bicyclic beta-lactams, such as the penicillins and cephalosporins. Administered parenterally, aztreonam provides peak serum concentrations for most Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is widely distributed throughout the body. Excretion is largely dependent on renal mechanisms, so dosage can be adjusted in the presence of renal impairment. The clinical uses of aztreonam include treatment of urinary tract, lower respiratory tract, and intraabdominal infections, as well as septicemia, endometritis, pelvic cellulitis, and skin and skin structure infections due to aerobic gram-negative organisms. It is concluded that aztreonam can be used with confidence in the single-drug treatment of susceptible aerobic, gram-negative pathogens. In the treatment of mixed infections, or those of unknown etiology, however, combination therapy is recommended to ensure coverage of gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria.\r"

  ".U": "90196060\r", 
  ".W": "The treatment of bacterial infections in neutropenic cancer patients presents a serious challenge to physicians. Although gram-positive infections have become more common in recent years, most infections in this population are caused by gram-negative bacilli. No single regimen has been found to be optimal, and most commonly used regimens are associated with significant disadvantages. Extensive investigation is therefore under way to evaluate the potential of several promising newer antimicrobial agents. Aztreonam, for example, is active against most gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and has been evaluated in several clinical trials in neutropenic patients. As the only agent with gram-negative activity or in combination either with aminoglycosides or with other beta-lactam antibiotics, aztreonam proved useful in the treatment of gram-negative infections in this population. Combination with an aminoglycoside, however, was not found to improve efficacy over aztreonam alone. In fact, since aminoglycosides may potentiate ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, it may be more appropriate to replace the aminoglycoside component of a combination regimen with aztreonam, as indicated by data from a study of aztreonam plus cefoperazone. Aztreonam selectively inhibits the aerobic gram-negative intestinal flora with only minimal disruption of anaerobic flora, and may be useful for infection prevention, but the importance of anaerobic preservation is not clear. It was concluded that aztreonam appears to be a useful agent for the treatment of febrile neutropenic patients, but further study is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Aztreonam is a structurally and immunologically unique beta-lactam antibiotic with activity exclusively against aerobic gram-negative micro-organisms. Between 1983 and 1988, its antimicrobial spectrum was evaluated against more than 5,800 fresh clinical isolates at a 300-bed community teaching hospital. Only 1.1 percent of Enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to aztreonam over the five-year study period, an incidence similar to that observed with aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam was found to be more active than third-generation cephalosporins and comparable with mezlocillin against Enterobacter spp., Morganella, and Citrobacter freundii. Although aztreonam was somewhat less active against nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter, overall more than 90 percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible. Ceftazidime was the most active beta-lactam tested against nonfermenters. Against aerobic gram-positive cocci, aztreonam possessed no clinically useful activity. No significant change in susceptibility to aztreonam was observed over the five-year study period for Enterobacteriaceae. For third-generation cephalosporins, however, a trend toward increased resistance was noted, particularly for Enterobacter spp. and C. freundii. A 50 percent increase in resistance to aztreonam was observed over the five-year study period for nonfermenters, particularly P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus. Similar increases in resistance were seen with other beta-lactams and gentamicin. Based on its potent in vitro activity, aztreonam appears to be a useful agent and a desirable alternative to aminoglycoside antibiotics for the treatment of pure aerobic gram-negative bacillary infections, or as a component in combination therapy against mixed infections.\r"

Orchiectomy, estrogen therapy, synthetic LHRH analogs and possibly antiandrogens are equally effective frontline treatment modalities. Ketoconazole is indicated in emergency situations, but chronic use is prevented by serious idiosyncratic toxicity and by long term complications. Combined androgen blockade (CAB), with leuprolide (or tryptorelin) and flutamide is more effective than single modality treatment in patients capable of strict treatment compliance. Estramustine phosphate may be as effective as CAB and may be the frontline treatment of choice in sexually active patients. Institution of single modality treatment may be delayed until cancer becomes symptomatic. Controversy lingers over whether the institution of CAB at an earlier time may improve progression free survival (PFS) and survival. Research projects of immediate clinical relevance include: comparison of CAB and estramustine; determination of the optimal time for CAB; study of other forms of CAB; and phase II trials of new cytotoxic agents.\r"

This is because the procedure is meant to be performed with an empty urinary bladder. It requires very little time once the operator is adequately trained. It provides excellent resolution despite high degrees of magnification. This allows for a distinction between a traditional ultrasound examination and this new concept of examining gynecologic patients with vaginal probe ultrasonography as a part of the routine overall gynecologic examination. Methodology and philosophic issues arising from such a concept are discussed.\r"

The majority of women showed retrograde contractions, with the contraction wave moving from the cervix to the fundus. In menstruating women and one case of abortion, the contractions were antegrade.

The antepartum testing consisted of a combined use of nonstress testing and contraction stress testing. If both the Doppler systolic/diastolic ratio and the antepartum testing were abnormal, there was a significantly increased incidence of intrauterine growth retardation (47%), fetal distress necessitating cesarean section (67%), and admission to neonatal intensive care (86%). Doppler umbilical artery flow studies are an important adjunct to antepartum fetal surveillance in high-risk patients but should not determine clinical management when standard antepartum surveillance remains normal.\r"

A Medline Data-Base computer program search from 1980 to 1988 identified 39 studies, 23 of which were accepted after independent review with preset criteria. An ideal test to predict chorioamnionitis or neonatal sepsis was not found. The low success rate for amniocentesis and the need for repeat taps preclude the acceptance of tests on the basis of amniotic fluid. Single, small studies, the precision of which has never been tested, show good indices for repeatedly increased serum levels of C-reactive protein (greater than 20 mg/L), a high level of C-reactive protein greater than 40 mg/L, or a day-to-day coefficient of variation for C-reactive protein of greater than 30% in the prediction of histologic or clinical chorioamnionitis. Ultrasonographic observation of fetal activity, if published study results are confirmed, may be of value to predict amniotic fluid bacterial colonization.\r"

In the present studies, the role of the terminal complement pathway in the accelerated autologous phase of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis in the rabbit was investigated. Normocomplementemic rabbits and rabbits deficient in C6 (C6D) who are therefore unable to form the terminal complement pathway were immunized with sheep immunoglobulin G (IgG) before being injected with a subnephrotoxic dose of the gamma 2 fraction of sheep anti-rabbit GBM. C6D animals had a delay in the onset of the glomerular injury, as manifested by proteinuria. At 72 hours, controls had a greater degree of proteinuria (15.2 +/- 8.8 mg protein/mg creatinine vs. 2.6 +/- 2.1, P = 0.197), but at 120 hours there were no differences in proteinuria between C6D and control animals (11.1 +/- 3.6 mg protein/mg creatinine vs. 12.2 +/- 6.2, P = 0.89). Light microscopy demonstrated more severe glomerular injury in C6D animals with marked cellular proliferation and large areas of glomerular necrosis. Interestingly, C6D animals had significantly higher levels of sheep IgG remaining in their glomeruli at 120 hours (0.95 +/- 0.12 micrograms sheep IgG/1 x 10(4) glomeruli, N = 11, vs. 0.57 +/- 0.07, N = 11, P = 0.014) and 72 hours (1.22 +/- 0.25 micrograms, N = 3, vs. 0.60 +/- 0.15, N = 3, P = 0.104) compared with 24 hours when there was no difference (1.25 +/- 0.22 micrograms, N = 7, vs. 1.08 +/- 0.14, N = 7, P = 0.53). C6D rabbits had a greater rise in serum creatinine at 120 hours (2.3 +/- 0.5 mg/dl vs. 1.3 +/- 6.4, P = 0.132). We conclude that in C6D animals, the persistence of glomerular immune deposits is responsible for more severe renal injury and renal failure.\r"

Methods for preparing fixed, embedded colonic tissue for PCR amplification of c-K-ras sequences from genomic DNA and for amplification of viral DNA from other tissues, including brain, lung, and liver, were evaluated. The effect of formalin fixation on the efficiency of amplification was also determined. While there seemed to be only a modest variation in the efficiency of the PCR for amplification of single-copy human genes, regardless of the methods used for tissue preparation, amplification of viral DNA sequences against a human genomic DNA background was more efficient when the DNA was purified to some degree before amplification of the tissue. We used the PCR to examine frozen and fixed embedded tissue sections for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA. One patient with a heart-lung transplant succumbed to a lymphoproliferative disorder, and EBV genome was present in tissues with abnormal lymphoid infiltrates. CMV was also present in bronchial lavages from the same patient, where cytologic diagnosis was not apparent. Another patient with a liver transplant showed CMV genome in multiple liver biopsies, with negative histologic results for CMV. In vitro DNA amplification with the PCR demonstrated sensitivity superior to that of histology in detecting CMV and EBV in the cases examined.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes-prone (DP) BB/Wor rats are lymphopenic, lack RT6.1+ T cells, and spontaneously develop diabetes mellitus. Diabetes-resistant (DR) rats are not lymphopenic, have normal numbers of RT6.1+ T cells, and rarely become diabetic. It has been reported that RT6.1+ T-cell depletion induced insulitis and diabetes in DR rats. To study the effector cells responsible for diabetes in DR rats after RT6+ T cell depletion, we treated a large number of intact and 21-day thymectomized DR rats with anti-RT6.1 monoclonal antibody, anticipating a high frequency of insulitis and diabetes. Our treatment protocol depleted RT6+ T cells but failed to induce insulitis and diabetes with the expected frequency in either intact or thymectomized DR animals. After Con-A stimulation however, RT6-depleted DR spleen cells readily transferred diabetes to DP recipients. These results suggested that while RT6+ T-cell depletion alone was permissive for the induction of diabetes in BB/Wor DR rats, a second stimulus was required to activate the DR effector cells responsible for insulitis and diabetes. In view of the occasional presence of pancreatitis and peritonitis in the diabetic RT6.1+ T-cell-depleted DR rats, additional experiments were performed in which RT6-depleted DR rats were also given intraperitoneal injections of sterile fecal suspensions to deliberately induce peritoneal inflammation. Insulitis and diabetes were significantly increased in these rats, lending credence to the requirement of a second (environmental) stimulus for the induction of diabetes in RT6-depleted BB/Wor DR rats.\r"

  ".W": "The influences of the epitope density on cationic antigens on the fate of immune reactants and the formation of subepithelial electron dense deposits (EDD) were studied in a model of active in situ immune complex glomerulonephritis (ICGN), using a hapten-carrier system. Three weeks after immunization with trinitrophenol conjugated bovine serum albumin (TNP17.3-BSA), the left kidneys of rats were perfused with 500 micrograms of TNP6.2-cationized human immunoglobulin G (C-HIgG) or TNP31.3-C-HIgG. The renal tissues were then examined at intervals by light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopies. The perfused kidneys of rats given high-valency antigens (TNP31.3) showed marked subepithelial EDDs with foot process retraction associated with proteinuria. In contrast, those of rats given low-valency antigens (TNP6.2) showed only small subepithelial EDDs beneath the slit membrane, which consisted of apparently normal epithelial cells, and did not develop proteinuria. Kinetic studies on immunofluorescence showed that glomerular depositions of immune reactants (TNP-carrier conjugate, rat IgG, and C3) were present longer in rats treated with high-valency antigens than in those treated with low-valency antigens. We conclude that the epitope density on cationic antigens strongly influences the retention of immune reactants and the formation of subepithelial EDDs, as well as development of glomerular injury.\r"

In 9 out of 10 isolates of freshly drawn P. vivax infected blood from different individuals, parasites of only 1 PV200 serotype was found within each individual infection, even though parasites were serotypically distinct between individuals. In 1 isolate parasite population, 3 distinct PV200 serotypes were identified. Thus, most P. vivax infections appeared to consist of a single genetically homogeneous population of parasites within the detection limits of the technique. The prevalence of P. vivax infections in an area of malaria transmission in southern Sri Lanka and the densities of oocysts in mosquitoes fed on P. vivax infected individuals indicated that parasite populations would be transmitted many times before encountering parasites of other origins, and that individual populations would tend to reduce to genetic homogeneity during transmission. These expectations are consistent with the high proportion of genetically homogeneous P. vivax isolates observed.\r"

Anopheles stephensi were fed on P. berghei infected mice treated 90 min earlier with 25 or 50 mg WR-238605/kg body weight. Mosquitoes engorging on drug-treated mice produced the same number of ookinetes as did those fed on controls; drug-fed mosquitoes produced fewer oocysts/mosquito than did controls. These oocytes developed more slowly than did those in control-fed mosquitoes. Sporozoites did not invade the salivary glands of drug-fed mosquitoes, nor did these mosquitoes transmit P. berghei to mice. Uptake of WR-238605 6 or 12 days after mosquitoes were infected with P. berghei had no effect on the percentage of mosquitoes with oocysts or the mean number of oocysts produced per mosquito. Oocyst development was significantly retarded in mosquitoes ingesting drug on day 6 postinfection. Subsequent salivary gland sporozoite infections were lighter in mosquitoes drug-fed on day 6 or day 12 than in control mosquitoes or mosquitoes drug-fed on day 18.

This cut-off level is higher than that used in previous reports from non-endemic areas. The test did not recognize patients with the acute fulminating form.\r"

Of these, one patient had multiple benign papillomatosis of the extrahepatic biliary tree. All four of the other patients were found to have unsuspected small carcinomas of the gallbladder in association with mid- or low bile duct cancer. Multiple tumors of the extrahepatic biliary apparatus may occur more frequently than previously thought, and the incidence of unsuspected gallbladder cancer in association with bile duct cancer may be high. These tumors should be suspected and looked for in each instance by intraoperative endoscopy and careful histologic examination of the gallbladder.\r"

Postoperatively, patients were randomized to receive three 15-mL injections (over 30 min) of crystalloid solutions (normal saline or Ringer's lactate) or no treatment (control) via the epidural catheter. Degree of motor and sensory blockade was evaluated with an investigator blinded to treatment group. Rate of resolution of sensory blockade was not different among groups. However, time for resolution of motor blockade was more than twice as long in the control group than in either treatment group (control = 178 +/- 70 min vs Ringer's lactate = 84 +/- 44 min, normal saline = 70 +/- 38 min, P = 0.001). The data suggest that unwanted motor blockade due to epidural anesthesia can be reversed by epidural injections of crystalloid solutions.\r"

  ".U": "90196613\r", 
  ".W": "Perioperative seizures have numerous potential etiologies. In general, when seizures occur during surgery, their onset often coincides with the introduction of a specific anesthetic or analgesic drug. Conversely, postoperative seizures are more commonly due to nonanesthetic causes. However, there have been reports of postoperative convulsions that appeared to be caused by anesthetic or analgesic drugs administered intraoperatively via inhalation or injection (e.g., intravenous, epidural, or peripheral nerve block). Some anesthetics appear to possess both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant properties. One possible factor is an inherent pharmacodynamic variability in the responsiveness of inhibitory and excitatory target tissues in the CNS. This is well illustrated by the anticonvulsant and proconvulsant effects of progressively higher doses of local anesthetic drugs. This variability in neuronal responsiveness could also explain the conflicting findings for low versus high doses of fentanyl and etomidate. Furthermore, biological variation in the individual patient's responsiveness to certain anesthetic drugs could be an additional contributory factor. Differing structure-activity relationships might also explain why some anesthetic agents possess both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant properties. Relatively minor modifications in a drug's structure can influence its affinity for a specific receptor site and its intrinsic pharmacologic activity. For example, when methohexital was first introduced, convulsions were commonly encountered in patients with and without a history of epilepsy. Subsequent fractionation of the original compound into its two isomeric forms resulted in the identification of the isomer primarily responsible for this convulsive activity. In its present formulation (Brevital; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, Ind.), the epileptogenic properties of methohexital are limited to patients with psychomotor epilepsy. However, compared with thiopental, excitatory effects are still more common with methohexital. The excitatory effects of methohexital are presumably due to its methylated structure. The inhaled anesthetic flurothyl (hexaflurodiethyl) ether and the intravenous anesthetic ketamine also illustrate how subtle changes in stereoisomerism can result in significant changes in structure-activity relationships. Flurothyl, a fluorinated ether analogue, reliably produces convulsions in nonepileptic patients, whereas its structural isomer isoindoklon has not been associated with seizure activity. Other examples of isomer or structural analogue relationships that produce differential effects on neuronal hyperexcitability include enflurane-isoflurane and meperidine-normeperidine. In conclusion, the patient population (epileptic or nonepileptic), the method of documentation (EEG study or clinical observation), and the method of EEG analysis (cortical or depth electrodes) must be considered to properly analyze the proconvulsant and/or anticonvulsant properties of an anesthetic or analgesic drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The authors have reviewed a sizable segment of their experience, dividing cases of malignant polyps into two broad categories: those in which complete polypectomy was followed by bowel resection; and those undergoing polypectomy alone. The determinants leading to one course or the other were analyzed, as were the results.\r"

Choledochoscopy may help to decrease the incidence of retained common duct stones. The present study reviews 97 consecutive CBD exploration cases performed between 1980 and 1988, in order to evaluate the authors' experience with flexible choledochoscopy and CBD exploration. Fifty-nine patients had CBD exploration plus flexible choledochoscopy and 38 underwent CBD exploration alone. Retained stones were found postoperatively in ten per cent of the patients who had only CBD exploration versus four per cent in the choledochoscopy group. The retained stones in five patients were later removed by percutaneous basket retrieval (3), flush irrigation (1), and choledochoscopy (1). Flexible choledochoscopy detected additional stones after routine CBD exploration in 12 patients, clarified T-tube cholangiograms in four patients, and aided stone extraction in two patients. For these reasons, and because choledochoscopy was associated with a lower incidence of retained stones, the authors believe this procedure is a worthwhile addition in most cases of CBD exploration.\r"

DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Inpatient units of a cancer center. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with biopsy-documented cytomegalovirus infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Cytomegalovirus was identified by culture or by immunohistologic or standard histologic analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Ganciclovir, 2.5 mg/kg body weight every 8 hours for 14 days, or placebo, with dosage adjusted for decreases in renal function. Therapy was discontinued if the neutrophil count or creatinine clearance fell below preset criteria. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Virus cultures of throat, urine, and blood specimens were done before, 3 times weekly during, and weekly for 3 weeks after therapy. Endoscopy was repeated after treatment. Patients were examined, and blood counts, electrolytes, and renal and hepatic function were monitored during therapy. Ganciclovir recipients had cessation of oropharyngeal (P = 0.001) and urinary (P = 0.004) cytomegalovirus excretion and negative cultures of repeat esophageal specimens (P = 0.002) more often than placebo recipients. No difference existed in either clinical symptoms or endoscopic appearance between the groups after treatment. Cytomegalovirus pneumonia occurred in four patients who received ganciclovir and in six who received placebo. One ganciclovir recipient and four placebo recipients were withdrawn from treatment because of neutropenia, but there was no overall difference in the proportional decrease in leukocyte counts between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although ganciclovir suppressed cytomegalovirus replication, 2 weeks of treatment was not associated with clinical or endoscopic improvement when compared with supportive care.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: An English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1966 to 1989), bibliographic reviews of book chapters and review articles, technology assessments of bone mass measurement, and other publications. STUDY SELECTION: We summarize prospective studies of fracture risk prediction done with widely used bone mass measurement techniques, and we document noncontroversial or peripheral points with recent papers and reviews. DATA EXTRACTION: Without osteoporosis screening trials, no quantitative analysis is possible. Instead, we assess the ability of screening tests to measure bone mass and define fracture risk categories, the ability of risk categories to determine treatment, and the ability of treatment to reduce fracture incidence. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Bone mass measurement meets many of the criteria for a screening test, and indirect evidence suggests that a screening program might reduce osteoporosis-related fracture incidence. No trial has shown this directly; however, and questions remain about overall benefits and costs of mass screening. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are clinical indications for bone mass measurement, unselective screening for osteoporosis cannot be recommended until a specific program is formulated and justified.\r"

  ".W": "Congophilic kuru plaques, one of the pathological hallmarks in kuru and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome, are sometimes present in patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The congophilic kuru plaques are composed partly of a host-encoded prion protein, and a missense variant prion protein with the codon 102 proline-to-leucine change (Leu102) is commonly present in patients with Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome. To investigate the relationship between this syndrome and CJD with congophilic kuru plaques, we made a sequence analysis of the prion protein gene from patients with CJD, with or without congophilic kuru plaques. We found no alterations other than the Leu102 change, common to Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome, in one of the prion protein alleles of the patient with congophilic kuru plaques. In the prion protein genotype analysis of other patients with CJD, the Leu102 allele was revealed to be carried heterozygously by 6 of 7 patients who had CJD with congophilic kuru plaques, yet no patient with CJD without congophilic kuru plaques had this allele. Interestingly, the Leu102 allele was also carried by some unaffected relatives of 3 patients with CJD with congophilic kuru plaques but with no apparent familial occurrence of a similar neurological disorder. Our findings show that CJD with congophilic kuru plaques should be categorized as belonging to Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome, not CJD, and also suggest that the variant prion protein with Leu102 is closely related to the amyloidogenesis seen in subjects with congophilic kuru plaques.\r"

Exercise was the main precipitating factor, both in patients with and in those without detectable enzymopathies. Thirty patients had specific enzymopathies without myoglobinuria: 14 had phosphorylase deficiency, 9 had MAD deficiency, 3 had phosphorylase kinase deficiency, 3 had PFK deficiency, and 1 had PGAM deficiency. Systematic biochemical evaluation of muscle biopsy specimens revealed specific enzymopathies in about half of the patients with idiopathic myoglobinuria.

For the purposes of the meeting, asthma was operationally defined as 'episodic wheeze and/or cough in a clinical setting where asthma is likely and other rarer conditions have been excluded'. In making a diagnosis of asthma, a full history is a prerequisite. Additional tests are only used to support clinical impression and to provide objective evidence for therapeutic recommendations. General features of a multidisciplinary approach include an appreciation of the importance of psychosocial factors, counselling, and education. Drugs should be prescribed in a rational sequence: beta 2-stimulants for mild episodic wheeze; sodium cromoglycate for mild to moderate asthma; inhaled steroids for moderate to severe asthma; with xanthines, ipratropium bromide, and oral steroids having their place in more persistent and severe cases. Children and their parents should be reassured that if asthma is properly controlled there is no reason why the child should not lead a normal and physically active life. The management of asthma is rewarding and return to 'normal' lifestyle is nearly always possible with active participation in sporting activities.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty one very low birthweight survivors with cerebral palsy were matched with controls by sex, gestational age, and place of birth. Using discriminant analysis, the perinatal profiles for infants with cerebral palsy and their controls were shown to differ significantly. When infants with various types of cerebral palsy were analysed with their controls the discriminating variables differed. Diplegic infants could be differentiated from controls on antenatal variables alone, but significant discrimination of hemiplegic and quadriplegic infants required the addition of postnatal variables. Cranial ultrasound appearances differed appreciably between types of cerebral palsy. Future studies should differentiate between types of cerebral palsy and include ultrasound data. Cerebral palsy in very low birthweight infants is unlikely to prove a useful outcome indicator for neonatal intensive care.\r"
