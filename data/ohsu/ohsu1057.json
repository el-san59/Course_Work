  ".U": "91231519\r", 
  ".W": "An immunohistochemical and morphometric analysis was performed on trephine biopsy specimens of the bone marrow in 40 patients (23 men and 17 women, mean age 62 years) with different subtypes of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to determine dysmegakaryopoiesis, but particularly precursor cells--that is, pro- and megakaryoblasts. In 31 of the 40 patients the numbers of megakaryocytes were increased which was associated with a predominance of smaller cell forms (micromegakaryocytes). Compared with periodic acid Schiff, immunostaining with a formalin resistant monoclonal antibody against glycoprotein IIIa (Y2/51(CD61) showed a clinically important proportion of immature elements. These could be designated pro- and megakaryoblasts by taking morphometric measurements on smears and bone marrow sections. There was a relevant increase in the number of promegakaryoblasts in 32 patients, consistent with uncontrolled expansion of the precursor pool. Seventeen repeated bone marrow biopsy specimens taken after chemotherapy largely showed a decrease in the numbers of megakaryocytes including the precursor cell population. Moreover, morphometric evaluation disclosed that micromegakaryocytes in MDS differ significantly from those in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) due to distinctive nuclear features and a disturbed nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio. These changes generate a more pleomorphic or atypical appearance of this cell population in MDS, compared with micromegakaryocytes in CML. It is concluded that the disproportionate increase in megakaryocyte precursors and the grossly abnormal aspects of micromegakaryocytes in MDS are characteristics of the severe defect involving haematopoiesis in this disorder.\r"

The biopsies were performed to determine the extent of bone marrow disease in 84 neuroblastomas, nine embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, five Ewing's sarcomas, two cases of Hodgkin's disease and two lymphoblastic lymphomas. Twenty seven (32%) of neuroblastoma bone marrows showed metastases by conventional histological techniques and 33 (39%) after immunohistochemical staining with NSE. Five embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, five Ewing's sarcomas, and two lymphoblastic lymphomas showed bone marrow metastases. Only one of these cases was reactive for NSE. NSE represents a very sensitive immunomarker for the follow up of neuroblastoma and improves detection of bone marrow invasion by neuroblastoma.\r"

In 13 patients examination of rectal biopsy material and faecal samples showed no pathogen, but in two of these, microsporidiosis was found by electron microscopical examination of jejunal biopsy specimens. This organism was also identified electron microscopically in one of the further five jejunal biopsy samples taken from patients with a known cause of diarrhoea. Blastocystis hominis infection was identified electron microscopically in six patients, all of whom had cryptosporidiosis additionally seen by light microscopy. Four of these six patients remained well for long periods, with only moderate diarrhoea, and follow up showed no evidence of blastocystis infection. In only four of 11 patients found to have cryptosporidium in their stools at light microscopy were organisms found at electron microscopy. Viral inclusions were only identified at electron microscopy in one of 10 patients with an opportunistic viral infection seen at light microscopy (cytomegalovirus n = 7, herpes simplex virus n = 3). No additional viral pathogens were detected in either stools or rectal biopsy material by electron microscopy. It is concluded that routine electron microscopic examination of stool samples or rectal biopsy material taken from patients with AIDS and diarrhoea is unnecessary and does not increase the yield of potential pathogens compared with standard microbiological techniques and histology.\r"

Nine were of the conventional type, three of the atypical cellular type, and one mixed. DNA ploidy was investigated and showed two of the tumours to be aneuploid and nine diploid (tissue was not available in the two other cases). The two aneuploid tumours were of atypical cellular and mixed histology, respectively; the diploid tumours were of the conventional type in eight cases and atypical cellular in one. The atypical cellular type has been reported to behave more aggressively, but the benefit of additional treatment after surgery to prevent recurrence remains unclear. Measurement of DNA content by flow cytometry, together with histological subclassification, may be useful in selecting patients who will benefit from further treatment after surgery.\r"

Amplification occurred with the DNA from the 15 serovars but not with that from other Chlamydia spp or with DNA from a variety of other organisms. Chlamydial DNA (10(-16) g) could be detected and the PCR seemed to be able to detect single organisms. Urethral swabs were obtained from 37 men with acute non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), 18 (49%) of whom were positive for C trachomatis by MicroTrak. As a result of clinical re-examinations 65 urethral swabs were available for analysis by the PCR. In comparison with MicroTrak, PCR had a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 94%, a positive predictive value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 98%. The PCR was apparently less sensitive (82%) in tests on urine samples. Overall, however, values of sensitivity and specificity of the PCR compared favourably with those of MicroTrak. The PCR for C trachomatis is likely to be a valuable technique for research, but problems of DNA contamination suggest that it should not be recommended for routine diagnosis.\r"

Over the whole group the sensitivity of the ELISA was 93.8% and the specificity 79.3%. The positive predictive value and negative predictive values were, respectively, 90% and 87%. These results suggest that the Bio-Rad GAP IgG H pylori ELISA is suitable for serodiagnosis of H pylori infections for most clinical purposes and thus makes H pylori serology available to routine diagnostic laboratories.\r"

One hundred and seventy seven streptococcal isolates were recovered from the mouths of 10 out of 12 healthy adult volunteers by use of a simple sampling procedure and a single selective medium. In all, 127 oral \"S milleri group\" isolates were identified by biochemical and serological tests, confirming the indigenous nature of these streptococci in the mouth. Most (70.1%) of \"S milleri group\" isolates were non-haemolytic, 26% were alpha-haemolytic, and 3.9% beta-haemolytic. Fifty four (42.5%) were serologically typable, of which 46 were Lancefield group F, suggesting that the mouth is an important source of Lancefield group F streptococci. A collection of group F streptococci from a range of sources was indistinguishable from a collection of oral \"S milleri group\" isolates on the basis of the tests used, supporting the general synonymity of group F streptococcus with the broader \"S milleri group\". The battery of tests was cheap and simple to perform, and was capable of identifying \"S milleri group\" isolates from a range of sources, including variants with wide sugar fermentation patterns.\r"

This antigen/antibody complex is then visualised firstly by gold labelled anti-immunoglobulin G, which binds to any human IgG that may be present, and then by silver amplification, resulting in a black permanent deposit on the microtitre well surface. Patient samples (n = 121) were screened using a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an equivalent SEGLISA. Results were comparable but the SEGLISA does not have the disadvantages associated with enzyme labels. The silver deposit may also be read visually or the dried plate may be stored for future reference.\r"

Intranuclear HPV DNA was detected in none of the adenocarcinomas, while positive controls gave a clear intranuclear signal. Adjacent areas of normal, koilocytic, and dysplastic squamous epithelium also gave positive results. It may be that squamous epithelium contaminates adenocarcinomas reported as positive by Southern blotting. Our results showing absence of detectable HPV DNA within adenocarcinomas suggest that HPV infection may not have a major role in the aetiology of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix.\r"

The lymphocytes showed the phenotype cIgM+, FMC7+, CD19+, CD20+, which was similar to that seen in Waldenstrom's macroglobinaemia, but the proliferation was repeatedly shown to be polyclonal both immunologically and by immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies. Eleven years after presentation the patient developed a malignant pulmonary blastoma, a rare pulmonary tumour of combined epithelial and mesenchymal origin. The failure to develop a lymphoid malignancy over 11 years together with immunological and genetic evidence of polyclonality confirms that PPBL is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder. The subsequent occurrence of a nonhaemopoietic malignancy suggests that benign lymphoid proliferations, like their malignant counterparts, may predispose to the development of neoplasia. A role for Epstein-Barr virus in the pathogenesis of one or both of these rare conditions is suggested by the finding of raised Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen titres.\r"

Genotypic analysis, however, showed clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor (TCR) delta chain gene, a marker of T cell or, less commonly, B cell lymphoid neoplasms. Other TCR genes, beta and gamma, were germline in all tissues examined. TCR delta is rearranged in precursor B cell and most T lymphoid neoplasms. A small proportion of cases (10%) of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) also show rearrangement of the TCR delta gene. To date TCR delta rearrangement has not been described in CMML. The aberrant TCR delta rearrangement shown in this patient with CMML provides further evidence of the clonal nature of this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Buffered lidocaine has been recently recommended for local anesthesia, as there is less pain on injection of the buffered solution. Reduced pain on injection of lidocaine and epinephrine buffered to a neutral pH was confirmed in 20 subjects (P less than .01). Concentrations of buffered lidocaine and epinephrine were performed in order to evaluate their stability. Buffered lidocaine dropped to 66.1% of initial concentrations after 4 weeks when stored at 25 degrees C. Buffered epinephrine fell to 1.34% of its initial concentration under similar conditions. Buffered lidocaine and epinephrine maintained 94.54% and 82.04%, respectively, of their initial concentrations after 4 weeks when refrigerated at 0-4 degrees C. Both lidocaine and epinephrine maintained greater than 90% concentration 2 weeks after buffering when stored at 0-4 degrees C. This permits batch buffering of lidocaine with epinephrine and storage for periods up to 2 weeks when properly refrigerated.\r"

Keloids are rapidly resolved with the use of flurandrenolide tape covered with positive-pressure chin-strap dressings. Streaks of hyperpigmentation are lightened with a combination of sunscreen, opaque makeup, tretinoin, and hydroquinone lotions. The loss of skin texture can be prevented by not abrading too deeply and avoiding subsequent bacterial contamination during wound healing. However, enlarged skin pores in the central portion of the face and hypopigmentation can be permanent complications.\r"

When thirst was induced by providing dry food pellets or after overnight fluid deprivation, old mice consumed significantly less water than younger mice over a one-hour period. When thirst was induced by administration of hypertonic saline, there were no age-related effects. Naloxone 7.5 mg/kg IP significantly suppressed drinking in 3- and 12-month-old mice, while 25-month-old mice did not show suppression. Dehydration-induced thirst is impaired in old mice, as it is in older humans. This may be related to the alteration in opioid mechanisms modulating thirst.\r"

The levels of both alpha 1(I) mRNA and alpha 2(I) mRNA were significantly lower in senescent fibroblasts, suggesting that one factor contributing to the decreased collagen content of aging skin may be decreased synthesis of these collagen mRNAs by senescent fibroblasts. Both mRNAs were reduced to the same extent, suggesting that coordinate regulation of the two Type I collagen genes is maintained in senescent fibroblasts.\r"

Animals were fed either ad libitum, or diets reduced 20% or 52% in total calories but approximately unchanged in total protein, vitamins, and minerals. Cytochrome P1- and P3-450 (cyp1A1 and cyp1A2, respectively) mRNA levels decreased approximately 40% between age 4-5 months (young) and 30-31 months (old) in ad libitum fed animals (p less than or equal to .05). Caloric restriction eliminated this decrease. Manganese-superoxide dismutase mRNA decreased significantly in old ad libitum fed mice, and caloric restriction eliminated this decrease. No change in manganese-superoxide dismutase activity was detected, probably due to its low level and the large variability inherent in the assay. Catalase mRNA increased with age, but was not affected by diet. Catalase activity increased significantly with caloric restriction in young and old mice, in the absence of an increase in catalase mRNA, suggesting translational or posttranslational effects. CuZn-superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and epoxide hydrolase mRNA, and the ratio of ribosomal to total mRNA did not change with age or diet.\r"

When subjects stood on a firm surface, increased body sway was associated with poor tactile sensitivity and poor joint position sense. When subjects stood on a compliant surface (which reduced peripheral sensation) with their eyes open, increased body sway was associated with poor visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, reduced vibration sense, and decreased ankle dorsiflexion strength as well as reduced joint position sense. Increased body sway with eyes closed on the compliant surface was associated with poor tactile sensation, reduced quadriceps and ankle dorsiflexion strength, and increased reaction time. Poor performance in two clinical measures of postural stability was associated with reduced sensation in the lower limbs as measured by joint position sense, tactile sensitivity and vibration sense, reduced quadriceps and ankle dorsiflexion strength, and slow reaction times. The prevalence of vestibular impairments was high in this group, but vestibular function was not significantly associated with sway under any of the test conditions. The results suggest that reduced sensation, muscle weakness in the legs, and increased reaction time are all important factors associated with postural instability. An analysis of the percentage increases in sway under conditions where visual and peripheral sensation systems are removed or diminished, compared with sway under optimal conditions, indicated that peripheral sensation is the most important sensory system in the maintenance of static postural stability.\r"

Additionally, pacing was positively related to cognitive impairment and to past life-threatening experiences. Results of the second study, an observational study of six cognitively impaired residents who paced frequently, showed that these residents paced more when the environmental conditions were conducive to pacing (e.g., adequate lighting, enough room within which to pace). We believe that pacing is a reflection of good health within the nursing home population and suggest that caregivers may want to encourage rather than inhibit this behavior in some nursing home residents.\r"

A tenfold increase in relative risk was associated with cholesterol less than 3.4 mmol/l, and the least risk was associated with the middle tertile of cholesterol levels (4.0-5.0 mmol/l). For any level of plasma cholesterol, risk was constant with time for at least 6 months. Low albumin, low hemoglobin, and high fasting glucose levels were also associated with increased mortality; cholesterol levels were nonlinearly related to levels of these risk factors. Proportional hazards models showed that immobility, presence of decubitus ulcers of at least stage II, and use of enteral feeding were also risk factors for death. Because hypocholesterolemia correlated significantly (p less than .05) with the presence of decubiti, elevated white blood cell count, and use of enteral feeding, the association between hypocholesterolemia and risk of death was most likely due to its association with malnutrition and infection.\r"

Using an instrumented chair and a videotape analysis, controlled chair rise performances were quantified in three groups of volunteers: young adults (Young, n = 17, mean age 23 years), elderly adults able to rise without the use of armrests (Old Able, n = 23, mean age 72 years), and elderly adults unable to rise without the use of armrests (Old Unable, n = 11, mean age 84 years). Rises both with and without the use of hands were observed. The total time to rise and the percent of that time spent in the two distinct phases of the rise, the body segment rotations used, and the hand forces exerted were measured. Despite no apparent functional impairment, the Old Able compared to the Young spent a larger percent time in the first phase of the rise and rotated their body segments by different amounts. When rising with use of hands, the Old Unable compared to the Old Able group took more time and used different body segment rotations and larger ratios of hand force to body weight. These data quantify chair rise performance in young adults and in elderly adults with differing functional abilities and enable biomechanical analyses of the importance of joint torque strengths and postural stability in that performance.\r"

Time domain analyses revealed no age effect on supine heart rate but standing heart rate decreased with aging (p less than .008). The SD of R-R intervals decreased with increasing age in both positions (p less than .001). Frequency domain analysis (Fast Fourier Transformation of R-R interval data) showed total spectral content to decrease with aging (p less than .001). Both high frequency (0.20-0.32 Hz) and low frequency (0.04-0.12 Hz) content were reduced with aging (p less than .001). The ratio of high to low frequency content, however, was not affected by age in the supine position nor were changes in this ratio in response to standing during spontaneous breathing. Although the absolute increase in low frequency content upon standing was less with aging (p less than .001), the percent increase in low frequency content was not related to age. Metronome breathing decreased total spectral content (p less than .001) but increased high frequency content, especially in younger subjects (p less than .03). In response to standing, greater proportional and absolute decreases in high frequency content occurred in younger subjects resulting in age differences in the changes in ratios of high to low frequency content with standing during metronome breathing. In summary, decreased heart rate variation was seen with aging, but the balance between parasympathetic and beta-adrenergic input at rest and in response to postural changes does not appear to be influenced by age during spontaneous breathing. Metronome breathing altered spectral content within subjects and produced age-related differences in responses to postural maneuvers not seen during spontaneous breathing.\r"

The three scales correlated with all intellectual abilities, with relationships being largest for POW. The PIC scales showed lower test-retest correlations than the intelligence tests.

  ".W": "Young and elderly females read vignettes describing short-term, long-term, and very long-term memory failures. Each vignette was accompanied by a photograph of an attractive or unattractive young or elderly female target person. Subjects judged each vignette for possible attributions for the target's failure (ability, effort, task difficulty, luck, and attention). They also rated whether the failure was a sign of mental difficulty and whether medical and/or psychological evaluation was indicated. Failures of elderly and unattractive targets were attributed to lack of ability. Failures of young targets were attributed to lack of effort and lack of attention, whereas failures of attractive targets were attributed to task difficulty and lack of attention. Elderly and unattractive targets were judged as having greater mental difficulty and need for evaluation than young and attractive targets. In an a priori comparison, age predominated over attractiveness in memory failure judgments. Subjects, particularly the young, considered very long-term failures more indicative of mental difficulty and need for evaluation than short-term or long-term failures.\r"

  ".W": "Autobiographical memory of old people (71-89 years) was studied by a method of free narratives, with normal subjects as well as patients with primary degenerative dementia (SDAT) at three stages of development. The chronological distribution of memories across the life span in both groups showed a peak in adolescence and early adulthood, decrease in mid-life, and increase in recent years. This distribution is different from the results found with the prompt word method among normal old adults, but is similar to the chronological pattern reported for vivid memories. The distribution in the demented group was more flat, which contradicts theories of selective preservation of early memories. With the progression of dementia, autobiographical memory deficits were first evidenced by inaccessibility or loss of memories, and, at a later stage, by loss of details of the retrieved memories and impairment of temporal structure. Events that marked transitions in the lives of the patients (\"landmarks\") were less subject to forgetting than nontransitional events. The article argues for an approach to autobiographical memory that takes into account sociocultural and developmental determinants of memorability as well as internal mechanisms of the cognitive system.\r"

Clustering of their judgment policies revealed four groups of women with respect to their approach to this decision. These groups of women were significantly different from each other on educational level, perceived experience of stress, and attitudes toward menopause and use of medications. Willingness to take hormonal therapy across all cases was related to attitudes about, and knowledge of, menstruation, perceived stress, mother's experience with menstrual problems, severity of symptoms, and use of vitamins. While there have been previous attempts to cluster rater policies, the current study represents a novel attempt to understand the differences between people who appear to have different policies about a decision problem, in this case, whether or not to take hormone therapy to counter menopausal symptoms.\r"

Because of their strong initial southern settlement and their labor force out-migration patterns in this century, many older Black migrants are \"provincial return migrants\" to the South, a migrant type that may decline among Blacks in the future. There is also a regional counterstream migration pattern among older Black migrants. Out-migrants in this stream from the South have elevated indicators of dependency. Suggestions are made for other related studies of Black retirement migration.\r"

It was hypothesized that persons with significant limitations in their ability to perform normal daily activities (ADLs and IADLs) in 1984 would be more likely to move, more likely to be living with others in 1986, and more likely to have entered an institution between 1984 and 1986 than those without limitations. When only those variables that were measured in 1984 were used as predictors, this turned out to be true for institutionalization and for living with others in 1986. However, among those remaining in households, residential mobility showed little relationship to disability when other variables were controlled. When the change in disability between 1984 and 1986 was added to the prediction equation, there were strong relationships between changes in disability and both residential mobility and adjustment in living arrangement, suggesting that people respond quickly to significant changes in disability. However, because we cannot be sure that the changes in disability preceded the mobility or changes in living arrangements, we cannot claim to have established a causal link between these events.\r"

Need factors emerge as the strongest correlates of physician visits, hospitalization, and overall service use. The degree of medical skepticism appears to exert some influence on utilization, particularly in regard to physician visits. A stronger belief in the value of health maintenance activities is associated with the use of a greater number of services overall, suggesting that preventive health beliefs may promote use of the health care system. Generally health locus of control appears to be unrelated to health service utilization. Implications for further research are discussed.\r"

In contrast, body awareness was not associated significantly with longitudinal changes in physician-initiated follow-up visits, internal referrals, external referrals, or hospital inpatient days. Other findings indicated that higher levels of patient-initiated utilization were associated with greater physician-initiated utilization, controlling for prior utilization.

The analysis yielded six distinct types of social climate: Supportive, Self-Directed; Supportive, Well-Organized; Open Conflict; Suppressed Conflict; Emergent-Positive; and Unresponsive. Facility and resident characteristics were related to social climate type. In addition, the type of social climate was related to resident adaptation. Supportive, Self-Directed and Supportive, Well-Organized facilities had residents who rated higher in well-being and levels of self-initiated activities and who used fewer health services. A configural approach to describing social climates and their determinants and effects may help to develop more humanistic residential facilities and to better match individual residents to appropriate housing placements.\r"

By age 85, in contrast, males had a higher absolute amount of active life expectancy.

The unemployment rate for economically active patients with epilepsy was 46% compared with 19% for an age and sex matched control population (p less than 0.01). Fifty nine per cent of patients with active epilepsy were unemployed. In those with an associated neurological or psychiatric handicap and those who were unskilled manual workers the unemployment rates were 79% and 77%, respectively. Patients with epilepsy were less likely to leave school with qualifications or undergo subsequent training or apprenticeships. They were more likely to be unskilled manual workers, single and living in rented accommodation. In an area of high unemployment patients with epilepsy have disproportionately greater difficulty finding work. High unemployment rates among patients with epilepsy are only one aspect of a spectrum of social and economic disadvantage.\r"

Three patients were able to produce rapid force pulses with normal contraction times, but the variability of their force responses was increased in comparison with the highly stereotyped responses produced by normal subjects. The other eight patients had prolonged contraction times and segmentation of the force profiles. The integrated area of the first agonist EMG burst and the rate of development of force (dF/dt) were less at any target level than what was needed to produce a fast response. The area of the EMG burst, however, did increase with target amplitude, and the relative increase of dF/dt, with target amplitude, was normal. It is concluded that the motor program subserving fast muscle contraction is preserved in Parkinson's disease, but its execution is characterised by improper scaling of motor output.\r"

The polio patients, who had paresis and atrophy, but were able to walk normally by making maximal use of all remaining anterior tibial motor units, showed type I (slow-twitch) muscle fibre predominance with a mean (SD) of 98 (2%) type I fibres versus 81 (8)% in the controls (p less than 0.01) and muscle fibre hypertrophy, the average type I fibre cross-sectional area being 108% (p less than 0.005) larger than in the controls. The number of capillaries per muscle fibre was not significantly different from that in the control group, but with the increased muscle fibre area in the polio patients, the capillary density was significantly lower. The number of capillaries in contact with type I fibres relative to fibre area was 40% lower in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.005). The levels of citrate synthase and phosphofructokinase were significantly lower (38% and 33%, respectively, p less than 0.05) in the patients than in the controls, indicating decreased oxidative and glycolytic potentials in the muscle fibres of the polio patients. It is proposed that the abnormal high-frequency activation of all remaining motor units during each step cycle recorded in these patients constitutes a stimulus for type I muscle fibre predominance and hypertrophy but that the overall low muscle usage results in a decreased stimulation of capillary proliferation and mitochondrial enzyme synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ratio of two observations within one session ranged from 0.85 to 1.18 and the ratio of left to right ranged from 0.82 to 1.22 (95% reference limits). In 20 volunteers the repeatability was tested after one week. The ratio of averages of three measurements in two successive weeks ranged from 0.82 to 1.23 (95% reference limits). There were only small differences between muscle groups concerning these ratios. A significant relation with age and weight/Quetelet Index could be demonstrated in some muscle groups. The mean strength of females is approximately two thirds of the strength of males. The data may be useful as reference values in the application of hand-held myometry.\r"

Patients had clinical and CSF hydrodynamic investigations. Monoamine concentrations were determined by reversed-phase liquid chromatography, cholinesterases and lactate were determined photometrically. In the AHS patients, CSF monoamine concentrations were not significantly different compared with controls, AD or MID patients. AHS and AD patients showed a similar reduction of CSF acetylcholinesterase activity compared with controls. Positive correlations were found in concentrations of CSF homovanillic acid, CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and CSF lactic acid versus CSF outflow conductance (that is, resistance against CSF outflow) in the AHS patients. A similar pattern was observed in a subgroup of MID patients characterised by dilated ventricles and disturbed CSF hydrodynamics. These data suggest that a low CSF outflow conductance may facilitate the clearance of acidic substances from the arachnoid space at the probenecid sensitive active transport site. Alternative explanations would be that a pathologically low CSF outflow conductance is accompanied by an inverse caudorostral flow of CSF or a compromised trans-ependymal diffusion.\r"

Students' exposure to sufficient patients with the common neurological conditions, with chronic neurological disability and particularly with acute neurological emergencies, is often deficient.

However, some patients with myasthenia gravis show a tendency to develop steroid dependency, and require extremely prolonged administration of fairly high doses of steroids. Various types of adverse reactions to steroids are likely to occur in such cases. To avoid this, intermittent, single-dose administration of steroids was performed on a trial basis in the present study. Prednisolone, in doses of 50-100 mg, was given once every 3-7 days in three steroid-dependent myasthenic patients, in one case for up to 6 years. The effects of the intermittent treatment were as good as, and adverse effects less frequently found than in single-dose, alternate-day administration.\r"

The highest proliferation (25.7%) was found within the small subset of activated, i.e. cytoplasmic immunoglobulin-containing, B lymphocytes. This provides further evidence that these cells are not the terminally differentiated plasma cells of classical cytology but progenitor cells capable of further proliferation. B-cell lymphomas could be easily identified. The detection of abnormally proliferating cell subsets could help in the differentiation of opportunistic infection from leukaemic infiltration.\r"

The aim of the study was to find whether treatment would result in an improvement of cognition, of functioning in daily life, decrease of behavioural disturbances, and decrease in burden experienced by the carers. Two of the six THA-treated patients demonstrated an increase on cognitive test scores with a moderate increase in the other outcome measurements. There was, however, no difference between the two groups in any outcome measurement after treatment. In addition, we found a reversible rise of liver transaminases in 4 of 6 patients in the treated group. This pilot study is too small to draw definite conclusions on the use of THA alone or in combination with lecithin. Our results suggest, however, that semi-structured interviews with the carers may be of value in the evaluation of treatment effects in patients with Alzheimer's disease.\r"

The likelihood ratio was used to calculate the predictive power of single findings and logistic regression to analyse combinations of findings. The best discriminatory finding was orientation immediately after the event according to the eyewitness and the age of the patient in the absence of an eyewitness report (P less than 0.001). We found a seizure five times more likely than syncope if the patient was disoriented after the event and three times more likely if the patient was less than 45 years of age. Nausea or sweating before the event were useful to exclude a seizure. Incontinence and trauma were not discriminative findings.\r"

The total chemotherapeutic dose was similar for all patients; the radiotherapy dose, however, was standard for 7 patients, while the other 6 received much higher dosages over limited regions of the spinal cord. Although most of these patients appeared normal both clinically and on magnetic resonance imaging, a neurophysiological study was performed to determine whether there was any involvement of the central or peripheral nervous system. Motor conduction velocity and sensory conduction velocity were measured in the lower limbs as well as spinal- and scalp-recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in response to stimulation of the posterior tibial and sural nerves at the ankle. In addition, motor evoked potentials were recorded from the upper and lower limbs during cortical stimulation. All neurophysiological data were normal in patients who had received a standard radiation dose, while most of those who had been exposed to higher doses showed altered cortical SEPs and a slowing of central conduction time (D10-P1). Thus even though they were asymptomatic, these patients appeared to have sustained CNS damage, mainly at the level of the spinal cord.\r"

Rational discussion of the proposed changes was sometimes replaced by passionate accusations about ethical behavior. A similar situation may arise in epidemiology today, as fundamental problems are noted in paradigmatic scientific methods, and as the available epidemiologic evidence is used not only in public policy controversies, but particularly in adversarial legal conflicts. When the basic scientific quality of epidemiologic evidence and methods is questioned, defenders of the status quo may respond by castigating the dissenters as fools or heretics, or by insinuating that they have been bribed with consultation honoraria. Since progress in any scientific field requires that problems be suitably recognized and solved, the current disputes about epidemiologic methods should be debated as issues in science, not as transgressions in ethics.\r"

An example demonstrates the process by which the model can be used. While a checklist procedure is regarded as neither useful nor appropriate for making an ethical decision, the existence of professional ethics guidelines is deemed a prerequisite, because it embodies the profession's values and social responsibilities. The place of professional ethics guidelines in making an ethical decision is central to the model and is shown to be fundamental to continued ethical conduct among epidemiologists.\r"

The question is whether it would be desirable to have a set of guidelines in written form. Those epidemiologists pressing for a written code perceive the theoretical advantage of one. Those opposed are concerned with the feasibility of developing an effective, enforceable code. Although I do not underestimate the difficulty of the task, the benefit of having written guidelines seems to me comparable to that of having written laws, albeit incomplete and imperfect--i.e. to inform the individual how his or her actions would be viewed in terms of professional norms. Steps have already been taken by the Society for Epidemiologic Research in cooperation with the American College of Epidemiology to draft a code of ethics for epidemiologists. Broad participation in this endeavor will be required if it is to succeed.\r"

Solutions are proposed including: dialectic and critical rationalism.\r"

Such reforms imply that scientific work supported by industry should not be considered reliable, that any potential for fraud or subconscious alteration of the work should be considered damning in itself. This thinking will promote an ad hominem evaluation of science, rather than an evaluation based on merits. The reality is that no scientist is impartial. To focus on the circumstances of the work rather than the work itself has the ironic effect of detracting from overall objectivity. Scientific objectivity does not arise through cultivation in the minds of individual scientists, none of whom can lay claim to this pinnacle of rationality, but by the process of open, rational criticism itself. Those who encourage that work be judged in respect to the funding source are slighting honest industry scientists and stifling rational discourse.\r"

The fundamental principals inherent to an epidemiologist's obligation to protect the public health is to identify real health problems and promote their resolution. It is in everyone's interest, including private industry, to respect those principals, and an industry supported epidemiology program can be an effective means for accomplishing that. These programs can be innovatively designed to protect those fundamental principles and thereby avoid conflicts of interest.

As an expert witness, the epidemiologist subscribes to an enforceable ethical code. Expert witnesses are subject to many motivations. These include the advocacy of truth and the gaining of professional satisfaction. Other motives, including the wish for financial remuneration, may be less altruistic but are not inherently bad.

This form of theory consists of a diverse set of ways of developing moral concepts and giving philosophical reasons that explain, augment, and criticize the rules of social morality. Moral theory provides a basis for moral reasoning about problems; this reasoning is analogous to legal reasoning, where one appears before a court with a well reasoned case in defense of one's conduct. Moral theory is no panacea for our contemporary moral concerns, but it is valuable ally in the attempt to resolve them.\r"

The epidemiologist's role in risk communication includes responsible interpretation of data, balanced and non-judgemental risk communication and careful attention to the biologic and population significance of study findings. Potential problem areas for epidemiologists which are discussed include deciding when risk is significant, working for an agency which does not want a communication to take place and the occasional need to violate confidentiality for overriding societal goals.

All staff must be carefully trained as to their responsibilities for protecting the privacy and safety for the participants. Adherence to these principles will promote the collection and dissemination of quality data while minimizing the risks and burdens to study participants.\r"

Although epidemiologic research seldom risks direct harm to subjects, it may still wrong them if it invades their interests (such as privacy) or treats them merely as means. Review by an IRB is thus justified if it improves the benefit-risk ratio; even more important, in most circumstances, informed consent should be obtained in advance from subjects, to promote subjects' autonomy, to improve the quality of research, to regularize the relationship of investigators and potential subjects, and to protect subjects' privacy. Nonetheless, in certain circumstances-illustrated here by considering three hypothetical studies-alternatives to the usual consent rules are acceptable.\r"

In 675, no other factors contributed to their infertility. Among these patients, with no problems other than mild endometriosis, 57% (16/28) became pregnant when treated expectantly, 54% (51/95) after being treated medically, 47% (9/19) after laparoscopic cautery treatment, 81% (147/181) after laparoscopic laser treatment and 84% (97/116) after conservative surgery (laparotomy). Statistical analysis of the pregnancy rates revealed no difference between expectant, medical and laparoscopic cautery treatment. No difference was noted between laparotomy and laser laparoscopy; however, there was a statistically significant difference between these treatments and expectant, medical and cautery treatment. Similar results were seen with stage II endometriosis in couples with no contributing factors other than endometriosis: 39% of patients (23/59) became pregnant after medical treatment, 70% (80/115) after laser laparoscopy and 74% (46/62) after undergoing major conservative treatment (laparotomy). A statistically significant difference between medical treatment and laparotomy as well as laser laparoscopy was noted. However, no such difference existed between laparotomy and laser laparoscopy. Therefore, it appears that in experienced hands the use of laser laparoscopy in stage I and II endometriosis is as successful as major surgery and statistically significantly better than expectant, medical and laparoscopic cautery treatment.\r"

To determine whether between-method variability was clinically significant, we used five different commercial radioimmunoassay methods to measure the concentration of estradiol in sera from nine patients undergoing induction of ovulation for gamete intrafallopian transfer. There were large differences between the estradiol concentrations measured in the same samples by the different methods. Furthermore, apparent changes in concentration that would be regarded as clinically significant may reflect nothing more than the imprecision of the assay. Physicians using serum estradiol measurements to support therapeutic decisions should be aware that an excessive reliance on those measurements may be misleading.\r"

Routine screening tests or empirical antibiotic treatment of infertile couples may be justified by the prevalence of these organisms. We studied the wives in 40 consecutive infertile couples. Monoclonal direct immunofluorescence (DIF) for C trachomatis was performed on fixed smears from endocervical swabs. M hominis and U urealyticum were isolated by inoculation of Hayflick (HF) medium, HF broth and Ureaplasma A7 agar with endocervical swabs. Using DIF, 11 (27.5%) specimens were positive, 25 (62.5%) were negative, and 4 (10.0%) were equivocal. DIF was repeated on smears from three of the last four patients; all three were positive for C trachomatis. One patient was lost to follow-up and excluded from the study. For the total 39 specimens the final results were 14 (35.9%) positive and 25 (64.1%) negative. M hominis was isolated from 3 (7.5%) endocervical swabs. None of the endocervical swabs yielded a culture positive for U urealyticum. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the clinical history and presence of infection with any of the three organisms. The prevalence of 35.9% for C trachomatis was surprisingly high for an infertile population and, if supported by culture confirmation, justifies routine screening. The potential adverse effects of these organisms on the success rate of highly specialized infertility treatments are essentially unresolved. Since our analysis of cost effectiveness as applicable to our unit, all new infertile couples are treated empirically with lymecycline.\r"

  ".W": "In rabbits, laser Doppler flow probes were placed in the jejunum and on the renal cortex. Pulsed Doppler probes were implanted on the abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric and femoral arteries for measuring blood flow velocity. Cardiac output was measured by thermal dilution. Either 30% or 40% of the calculated blood volume was withdrawn through a carotid catheter. After 30 or 60 minutes, an initial bolus of either lactated Ringer's (LR, 16 ml/kg) or 7.5% hypertonic saline/6% dextran 70 (HSD; 4 ml/kg) IV was followed by unlimited IV LR (administered as rapidly as possible) to restore systemic arterial blood pressure to the prehemorrhage levels. With HSD, arterial pressure corrected more rapidly (p less than 0.05), and the initial hemodilution was greater (p less than 0.05), but there were no differences by two hours. With HSD, cardiac output (90%-100% vs. 130%-160% of control; p less than 0.05), plasma Na+ (139-140 mM vs. 146-148 mM; p less than 0.05) and plasma osmolarity (292-295 mOsm vs. 308-310 mOsm; p less than 0.05) were all significantly higher than the values with LR, but there was no effect on blood flow velocities through the infrarenal aorta, femoral artery, or superior mesenteric artery. Renal cortical perfusion (56% vs. 97% of control; p less than 0.05) and jejunal mucosal perfusion (83% vs. 162% of control; p less than 0.05) were significantly higher with HSD. HSD had no detectable effect on bacterial translocation at 24 hours. Thus: 1) HSD restores blood flow more rapidly to the gut mucosal and kidney microcirculations than initial resuscitation with LR; 2) the mechanism could be associated with a transient hemodilution and persistent increases in plasma Na and osmolarity, which reduce hemorrhage-induced cell swelling and blood viscosity changes; and 3) laser Doppler analysis could aid in the diagnosis of reperfusion injury after shock.\r"

However, it is not known if a larger volume of fluid resuscitation corrects this dysfunction. To study this, rats were bled to and maintained at a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg until 40% of the MB volume was returned in the form of LR, and then resuscitated with 4x or 5x the volume of MB with LR. Three doses of indocyanine green (ICG) were given intravenously and [ICG] measured in vivo using an in-vivo hemoreflectometer. The initial velocity of the clearance of ICG was calculated. Maximal velocity of the clearance (Vmax: the number of functional ICG receptors) and kinetic constant (Km: the efficiency of the active transport) were determined from the Lineweaver-Burk plot. Vmax decreased during hemorrhage, was restored to control levels at 0-4 hours after resuscitation, but decreased at 4-8 hours after resuscitation despite restoration of cardiac output following resuscitation with 5x LR. This could be the result of increased TNF release. The Km also decreased during hemorrhage, but increased at 0-1.5 hours and remained at control levels even 4-8 hours after resuscitation. Thus the failure of Vmax to remain at control levels following adequate fluid resuscitation may form the basis of cellular dysfunction and multiple organ failure after severe hemorrhagic shock.\r"

IBU treatment in vivo significantly enhanced TNF release by pM phi compared with untreated hemorrhaged animals, while TNF release by sM phi was only slightly increased. These data indicate a major role of PGE2 in the regulation of TNF release by pM phi following hemorrhage.\r"

The brachial nerves were stimulated (BNS) alternately to obtain a rise in heart rate of 18% and in mean arterial pressure of 17%. This stimulation was started 75 minutes before the start of hemorrhage and maintained throughout and after the withdrawal of blood. The animals were bled at a rate of 0.75 ml/min.kg until a total of 30 ml/kg had been removed. At the end of hemorrhage the reductions in cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), and left ventricular stroke work (LVSW) were greater in the BNS group compared with controls. The nociceptive stimulation also elicited greater reductions in oxygen delivery (DO2I) and oxygen consumption (VO2) and a greater rise in the arterial plasma lactate concentration. Thus it seems that nociceptive stimulation exacerbates the changes in systemic oxygen transport and cardiac function induced by hemorrhage.\r"

The patients in this prospective study were divided into an HLS group [n = 17, burn size 61 +/- 0.5% BSA (mean +/- SEM), resuscitated with hypertonic lactated saline] and an iso-Na group (n = 29, burn size 60 +/- 4.5% BSA, resuscitated with lactated Ringer's solution). During DPB 3 to 5, the Respiratory Index (A-aDO2/PaO2), functional extracellular fluid volume (f-ECFV), an ratio of plasma volume to interstitial fluid volume (PV/ISFV) were increased in the iso-Na group compared with the HLS group. During the same period, the Respiratory Index and PV/ISFV correlated significantly; respiratory dysfunction was less in the HLS group. Nearly 50% of the iso-Na group required endotracheal intubation. Sodium loads were the same in both groups; the HLS group required less water. These results suggest that extracellular fluid distribution differs between the two treatments; HLS may be associated with ameliorated respiratory function not only because of less volume loading during resuscitation, but also because the PV/ISFV ratio is less than when lactated Ringer's is administered.\r"

The mean Revised Trauma Score was 6.4 +/- 0.4, and the Injury Severity Score, 29.3 +/- 2.3. Twelve (60%) patients arrived in shock (SBP less than 90 torr). Eight (2%) of 212 portal blood cultures were positive; seven were presumed contaminants. The only positive systemic culture (total, 212) was a Staphylococcus aureus on day 5 in a patient with a concurrent staphyloccal pneumonia. In the first 48 hours, we could not detect endotoxin in portal or systemic blood. Additionally, simultaneous portal and systemic blood levels of complement fragment C3a, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 were nearly identical and, specifically, were not different in those patients who developed MOF. In summary, this prospective clinical study has not confirmed portal or systemic bacteremia within the first 5 days postinjury, despite an eventual 30% incidence of MOF.\r"

Forty-eight hours after injury, animals were killed and organ samples obtained for analysis. Bacteria of the same biotype as that found in the intestinal lumen were present in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of 9 of 9 burned pigs and 5 of 6 pigs undergoing partial vascular occlusion. The DNA content and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity were increased in the colon mucosa of animals from both the reduced-flow and burn-injured groups compared with control animals. Decreased blood flow to the gut may contribute to the development of bacterial translocation. In addition, intestinal regenerative capacity remains intact 48 hours after injury.\r"

  ".U": "91232130\r", 
  ".W": "Receptors known as DREG adhesion molecules on human neutrophils and monocytes provide for homing of these phagocytic leukocytes to sites of inflammation. They mediate the initial adhesive interaction of the leukocytes to vascular endothelial cells and are then shed from the cell surface in response to chemotactic factors and inflammatory mediators. Systemic accumulation of these agents following major injury or sepsis may therefore promote shedding of DREG receptors from circulating leukocytes and impair their recruitment to sites of inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we have analyzed the expression of DREG receptors on neutrophils and monocytes from 25 patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit. Receptor expression was measured by flow cytometry of cells stained with murine monoclonal DREG-56 anti-DREG antibody. For 14 nonseptic patients, mean monocyte positivity for DREG was reduced from 64% to 40%. For 11 septic patients, mean neutrophil and monocyte positivity for DREG was reduced from 94% to 82% and 64% to 34%, respectively. These results suggest that monocytes are more affected than neutrophils in vivo by conditions expected to stimulate shedding of DREG and that sepsis promotes shedding of these adherence receptors. Accumulation of DREG-negative monocytes in association with sepsis may be sufficient to impair their recruitment to inflammatory sites and limit their contribution to host defense against infection and tissue repair.\r"

Ninety-two patients with evidence of anterior chest trauma were entered into the study and had 1) an ECG on admission and daily for three days; 2) monitoring of the myocardial band fraction of creatine phosphokinase (CPK-MB) on admission and every eight hours for 24 hours; 3) continuous electrocardiographic Holter monitoring for three to five days; and 4) noninvasive pulsed-Doppler cardiac output measurements daily for three days. Twenty-three patients developed 25 significant arrhythmias (SARRs): 1 atrial fibrillation, 1 AV dissociation, 5 supraventricular tachycardias, and 18 paroxysmal ventricular tachycardias. Cardiac outputs were significantly higher in those patients without SARRs. The CPK-MB levels correlated with the SARRs but were neither sensitive nor specific. No patients required specific therapy and none developed adverse sequelae of the SARRs. We conclude that 1) CPK-MB monitoring should not be routinely used for screening and diagnosis; 2) continuous arrhythmia monitoring deserves further clinical investigation but not routine application; 3) stable patients at risk for myocardial contusion should be monitored for 24 hours; and 4) the Abbreviated Injury Score for \"minor\" myocardial contusion should be deleted for purposes of ISS tabulation.\r"

Pancreatitis occurred in three cases (23.1%) and caused one death. Pancreatic fistulae occurred in 50% of patients surviving two or more days after DL. No long-term survivor developed overt diabetes mellitus. Malabsorption occurred in 50% of the long-term survivors of DL. When the DL and PJ groups were compared no statistically significant difference could be found in either mortality or pancreatic morbidity. The 46.2% survival rate for DL warrants its consideration as a technique available to trauma surgeons when faced with an unstable patient unable to tolerate further operative therapy.\r"

We developed an experimental canine model to prospectively evaluate posterior wall intimal flaps in the superficial femoral artery. Arterial intimal flaps were constructed in 20 anesthetized dogs (40 arteries) and evaluated by arteriography, and angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. Postoperative patency rates at 1 (n = 20) and 3 weeks (n = 20) were compared with a control group of ten animals (n = 20, arteriotomy without intimal flap). Acute thromboses occurred in five experimental arteries with thromboses of eight additional experimental arteries at followup. Control patency was 100%, while experimental group patencies were 75% (p less than 0.05) at 1 week and 60% (p less than 0.009) at 3 weeks. All thrombosed arteries had intimal flaps with greater than 75% luminal stenosis. We conclude that intimal injuries cause arterial thromboses acutely and during subsequent followup. Intimal flaps with stenosis greater than 75% as determined arteriographically are at greatest risk for thrombosis. Angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound characterize arterial intimal defects and may delineate injuries requiring surgical or endovascular repair.\r"

Of 14 patients who had initial absence of SSEP activity after the N20 wave or lost this activity during the period of monitoring, 12 died and two remained vegetative. Eighteen of 22 patients who had preservation or enhancement of this activity had a functional survival (3-month outcomes, p less than 0.001). The best outcomes were observed in the patients with the greatest number of peaks and highest amplitudes in the SSEPs, often in spite of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The management of three patients was altered as a result of SSEP monitoring. We conclude that continuous monitoring of SSEPs is a useful adjunct in the management of comatose head-injured patients.\r"

This study compares the techniques of nerve grafting and nerve expansion/repair for the management of nerve injuries with segmental nerve loss in an animal model. Bilateral segmental sciatic nerve defects were created in eight dogs. On one side a 2-cm segment was excised and replaced with a nerve graft; on the other side a 2-cm defect was created with ligatures and the nerve underwent preliminary expansion and then repair. Eighteen months later nerve conduction velocity (NCV), gastrocnemius contraction force (GCF), and muscle weight (GMW) were determined for the seven surviving animals. NCV for the expanded repair was 58.66 +/- 34.18 m/sec and 47.73 +/- 7.93 for the grafted repair (p = 0.4); GCF was 619.04 +/- 353.70 gm for the expanded repair and 726.80 +/- 415.78 gm (p = 0.2) for the grafted repair; and GMW was 82.80 +/- 5.68 gm for the expanded repair and 109.55 +/- 20.63 gm (p = 0.02) for the grafted repair. The data suggest that: 1) conventional tissue expansion techniques can be used successfully to repair segmental peripheral nerve defects; 2) NCV and GCF are comparable for grafting and expansion/repair techniques although GMW is significantly higher in the grafted group; and 3) nerve expansion/repair may prove to be a useful alternative to grafting.\r"

TRISS analysis, which uses the Revised Trauma Score (RTS) and Injury Severity Score (ISS) to predict survival, is an effective tool for comparing outcomes between trauma centers. It has been argued that blunt trauma outcome differs between children and adults, yet the Major Trauma Outcome Study (MTOS) adult data base (ages 15-54 years) regression weights have been used by others to calculate TRISS scores for injured children. This study appears to be the first to perform TRISS analysis on groups of children and adults treated by the same surgeons using the same treatment protocols to assess the validity of applying \"adult\" TRISS analysis to children. The charts of 346 consecutive children (ages 0-14) and 346 random adults (ages 15-54) admitted to a regional trauma center for isolated blunt trauma over a 30-month period were reviewed for demographics, mechanism of injury, RTS, ISS, and survival. Statistical evaluation included TRISS survival analysis and calculation of the Z statistic. The median ISS was 10 for both children and adults. The Z statistics for children and adults were similar (1.85 and 1.81). Analysis demonstrated the groups to be statistically identical with a nonsignificant trend toward improved survival compared with the MTOS baseline group. These data support the use of existing TRISS analysis for evaluation of pediatric trauma care.\r"

Twelve intact fresh human cadaver heads were impacted onto standard or energy-absorbing steering wheels with a custom-designed and validated vertical-drop apparatus. Either zygoma was impacted once at a velocity of 2.0-6.9 m/s. The specimens were oriented to permit a direct comparison between pretest and posttest radiography, and two-dimensional and three-dimensional CT images. Bone mineral content was determined, and biomechanical forces, accelerations, and deformations were recorded. More severe fractures were associated with higher forces on the zygoma. With increasing velocities, fractures initiated at the zygomatic region propagated to other unilateral regions such as the mandible and orbit or to the contralateral side. Less facial trauma was observed with energy-absorbing steering wheels compared with standard wheels at similar impact velocities. Bone mineral content did not correlate well with specimen age or with fracture severity. Clinically significant fractures were identifiable on 3-D CT images. The flexibility of 3-D CT in evaluating the spatial extent of facial abnormalities in different orientations may have significant impact in planning surgical procedures.\r"

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of the argon beam coagulator (ABC) in the management of experimental splenic injury. Ten adult miniature pigs were randomized to treatment with either conventional surgical techniques (topical Surgicel, electrocautery, suture-ligation, digital pressure) or splenic repair with the ABC. Three standard splenic injuries were made in each pig: capsular avulsion, splenic laceration, and hemisplenectomy. The ABC was more effective in treating all three types of splenic injury. The time required to achieve hemostasis and total operative time were significantly less in the group treated with the ABC for all three types of splenic injuries (p less than 0.05, Student's t-test, two sided). Operative blood loss was significantly less in the group treated with ABC for avulsion and hemisplenectomy (p less than 0.05, Student's t-test, two sided). Recurrent bleeding was significantly higher in the group treated with conventional techniques (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test, two-sided). We conclude that the argon beam coagulator is more effective than conventional techniques in treating experimental splenic injuries. The ABC provides more rapid and reliable hemostasis. Clinical trials using the ABC for splenic injury are warranted.\r"

Dermal scleroderma was found in eight of nine punch biopsy specimens and eight of nine excisional biopsy specimens. Fascial scleroderma was found in eight excisional biopsy specimens. One specimen obtained by excision had no fascia present. Eleven biopsy specimens showed edema of the dermis, and 13 showed dilated lymphatic structures; thus, the clinical picture of edematous sclerosis was confirmed. Mucinous fasciitis was present in five excisional biopsy specimens, in conjunction with a large number of macrophages in four. Dermal mucinosis was present in 11 biopsy specimens. Lymphocytic and macrophage inflammation was minimal in 14 biopsy specimens and pronounced in only 4. Plasma cells were present in eight cases. Eosinophils were present in substantial numbers in three biopsy specimens and only occasionally in four. Eosinophilic spongiosis was observed in one patient. Lymphocytic inflammation was noted around a single muscle spindle and around large nerve trunks in three patients. No relationship was established between these pathologic features and the duration or dose of tryptophan, prednisone treatment, or duration of symptoms. Pathologic features of the L-tryptophan syndrome consist of hyaline sclerodermoid collagen in the dermis, the septa, and the fascia. Edema, focal mucinosis, and macrophage inflammation may be features that identify this event.\r"

Of these procedures, 693 were done in patients 71 through 80 years of age, and 56 were done in patients between the ages of 81 and 90 years. The neurologic morbidity and perioperative mortality in the former group were 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively, whereas in the latter group the corresponding values were 5.4% and 0%, respectively. For the entire group, the neurologic morbidity was 3.1% and the mortality was 1.3%. Of the 23 new postoperative neurologic deficits, 19 (83%) occurred in high-risk patients with severe preoperative neurologic or medical risks, and 14 (61%) of these deficits were minor. In selected elderly patients with symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusive disease, endarterectomy seems to be a safe procedure that is associated with acceptably low perioperative morbidity and mortality.\r"

Only 7% of the blocks were incomplete and thus necessitated either general anesthesia or block supplementation with thiopental sodium and nitrous oxide. No persistent neurologic deficit was ascribed to the anesthetic technique. This review indicates that brachial plexus block, especially with use of the axillary approach, is a safe and effective option for outpatient surgical procedures on an upper extremity.\r"

Of the original 463 patients, 168 completed and returned the psychologic questionnaires. These patients had evidence of psychologic stress in excess of that expected on the basis of normative data. Furthermore, the degree of stress was unrelated to the clinical severity of the original cardiac defect. In addition, the psychologic stress occurred despite \"success\" as defined by educational achievement and occupational level. One can speculate that as children these patients were exposed to environmental stresses that may well have been colored by parental attitudes and perceptions.\r"

A complete or partial response to 6-mercaptopurine therapy was noted in 47% of patients, and therapy failed in 53%. The age of the patients, prior resection, or initial symptoms did not influence the response. The clinical response was better in male than in female patients and in patients with involvement of both the small intestine and the colon than in those with only enteritis. 6-Mercaptopurine is a possible alternative to long-term corticosteroid therapy or surgical treatment in selected patients with severe Crohn's disease.\r"

  ".W": "The myelodysplastic syndromes are composed of a group of clonal hematologic neoplasms, the course of which is complicated by ineffective hematopoiesis or leukemic transformation (or both). Therapeutic results may have been misleading in the past. Most patients have been managed with supportive measures, such as transfusions of erythrocytes, administration of antibiotics, and transfusions of platelets during active bleeding episodes. These supportive measures have prolonged and improved the quality of life of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Vitamin supplementation (folate, vitamin B12, and pyridoxine) has seldom been rewarding. Differentiation agents such as cis-retinoic acid and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 have been of benefit in only a limited number of patients. Androgens have not been useful, although danazol, which is an attenuated androgen, has been effective in a subset of patients with the presence of cell-bound platelet antibodies. Low-dose cytarabine, which has been studied extensively because of its differentiating activity in vitro, is associated with a generally low rate of complete remission and substantial toxicity. Antileukemic therapy is generally useful in young patients with rapidly progressive disease. Several hematopoietic growth factors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials; their use in combination or in conjunction with chemotherapy may be opening new horizons for these patients. With improvements in the prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease, allogeneic transplantation is a viable option for patients younger than 55 years of age who have severe cytopenias.\r"

  ".W": "The von Willebrand factor (vWF) gene spans 178 kilobases in the human genome, is interrupted by 51 introns, and has been localized to human chromosome 12p12----12pter. In addition, a pseudogene that duplicates the midportion of the vWF gene has been identified on chromosome 22. In several families, large vWF gene deletions have been identified as the basis for von Willebrand's disease (vWD). In most patients, however, the vWF gene is found to be grossly intact by Southern blot analysis, a result that implies a more subtle molecular defect. The advent of the polymerase chain reaction has allowed a more direct analysis in this group of patients. By this approach, missense mutations, all clustered within the same small region in the midportion of the vWF molecule, have been identified in several patients with type IIA vWD. Expression of mutant vWF by transfection into COS cells suggests that the characteristic loss of high-molecular-weight multimers seen in type IIA vWD may occur through at least two distinct mechanisms. In preliminary studies of nondeletional type III vWD, a family has been identified with decreased vWF as a result of failure of production of messenger RNA from the affected vWF allele. This disorder could be due to defects in vWF gene transcription, RNA processing, or stability. As additional defects are identified, the accurate diagnosis of vWD at the molecular level may eventually become possible.\r"

Each patient was followed up for 2 years or until an endpoint (a doubling of the baseline plasma creatinine or a need for dialysis) was reached. The difference between the diet groups in cumulative renal survival defined by these endpoints (27 low-protein, 42 controlled-protein) was of borderline significance (p less than 0.06). The difference in renal survival between the low-protein and controlled-protein diet groups was of borderline significance in group A (0 vs 4 endpoints), significant in group B (10 vs 21 endpoints; p less than 0.025), and not significant in group C. There were no differences among the diet groups or subgroups in mean plasma creatinine concentrations, creatinine clearance, the slope of the plasma creatinine reciprocal, or mean blood pressures. Compliance was good in the controlled-protein group but poor for the low-protein diet: the difference in protein intake between the groups was substantially less than that required by the protocol. However, there was no correlation between the progression of renal failure and protein catabolic rate. These findings offer little, if any, support to the hypothesis that protein restriction retards CRI progression: careful medical care and a \"normal\" controlled protein intake also allow very slow progression of CRI.\r"

We have completed a two year, single-blind study to investigate whether the progression of dementia could be slowed by the trivalent ion chelator, desferrioxamine. 48 patients with probable AD were randomly assigned to receive desferrioxamine (125 mg intramuscularly twice daily, 5 days per week, for 24 months), oral placebo (lecithin), or no treatment. No significant differences in baseline measures of intelligence, memory, or speech ability existed between groups. Activities of daily living were assessed and videorecorded at 6, 12, 18, and 24 month intervals. There were no differences in the rate of deterioration of patients receiving either placebo or no treatment. Desferrioxamine treatment led to significant reduction in the rate of decline of daily living skills as assessed by both group means (p = 0.03) and variances (p less than 0.04). The mean rate of decline was twice as rapid for the no-treatment group. Appetite (n = 4) and weight (n = 1) loss were the only reported side-effects. We conclude that sustained administration of desferrioxamine may slow the clinical progression of the dementia associated with AD.\r"

HIVCHEK was used as a screening test, and serodia-HIV as a supplemental test to evaluate these assays in an alternative testing strategy to the standard ELISA/western blot testing procedure. In each country, HIVCHEK was more sensitive and specific than ELISA when compared with western blot. The sensitivity of HIVCHEK ranged from 87.0 to 96.3% and the specificity from 99.0 to 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of serodia-HIV ranged from 85 to 98% and from 88 to 98%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were affected by the presence of HIV-2 in Ghana and Senegal. Overall, with an HIV-1 prevalence of 14.8% in Kenya and 22.5% in Zaire, the sensitivities of the alternative strategy were 96.4% and 91.4%, the specificities 99.6% and 100%, the positive predictive values 97.6% and 100%, and the negative predictive values 99.3% and 97.9% for Kenya and Zaire, respectively. With this testing format there was an estimated average cost saving of up to 82% over the conventional strategy with ELISA/western blot.

A specially modified laryngoscope with multiple ports into which a 14- or 16-gauge ventilation needle can be advanced just distal to the vocal cords simplifies this form of anesthesia and ventilation. Jet ventilation has been advocated in place of conventional ventilation methods during carbon dioxide laser surgery because it eliminates the potential fire hazard of the endotracheal tube and allows superior visibility of the vocal cords. Despite these advantages, it is still not in common use. We will review the airway mechanics and special anesthesia considerations that make jet ventilation a safe and time-proven technique.\r"

There are several drawbacks to Teflon injection, among them respiratory obstruction (from overinjected Teflon) and unsatisfactory voice quality (Teflon causes stiffness of the vocal folds). This paper is a preliminary report on lipoinjection instead of Teflon injection into a paralyzed vocal fold. Fat appears to impart a soft bulkiness to the injected cord, while allowing it to retain its vibratory qualities. It is autologous material and can be retrieved if excessively overinjected. The fate of autologous fat injected into a paralyzed vocal cord remains unknown. Most of the literature on lipoinjection concerns repairs of depressed scars or breast augmentation. Our longest follow-up has been 12 months. Three patients have had this procedure, and the results appear to be very encouraging.\r"

The authors present a series of 89 fine-needle aspiration biopsies performed between January 1973 and December 1988 on 86 pediatric patients with clinically significant head and neck masses. All fine-needle aspiration diagnoses were confirmed by subsequent surgical biopsy, autopsy, or clinical follow-up for a minimum of 18 months. Of 21 tumors identified, 19 were malignant. Of the 89 aspirations performed, 67 required no subsequent surgical biopsy. In 11 of these cases, metastatic or recurrent tumor was diagnosed and appropriate therapy instituted. Fifteen of the 89 aspirates revealed previously undiagnosed tumors requiring surgical intervention. One false-negative and two false-positive results were obtained. No radical treatment resulted from the false-positive diagnoses, and no patient delay in treatment occurred because of the false-negative result. The sensitivity was 94.4%, and the specificity was 97.1%. The usefulness and cost-effectiveness of fine-needle aspiration is stressed.\r"

The principle of intermicroscopic correlation, i.e., the sequential examination of a specimen by different microscopic procedures, is illustrated with giant cilia. After re-embedding the scanning electron microscopic specimens and precisely locating a ciliary convolution by light microscopy in semithin section, the giant cilia were studied in ultrathin sections by transmission electron microscopy. The cilia were shown to be at least 9 microns long (normal ciliary length = 4-6 microns). Central and peripheral microtubular axonemal structures with a 9 + 2 arrangement were clearly shown in both longitudinal and cross section. Giant cilia, thus, most closely resemble outgrowths of normal cilia. If they are motile at all, they seem unlikely to effect a transport function coordinated in direction and time.\r"

The larynges of 23 sudden infant death syndrome victims, as well as 6 infants and 3 fetuses who died of other known causes, were examined in this study. While thickening of the basement membrane of the vocal cords was apparent in all sudden infant death syndrome victims, no such finding was present in the larynges of infants and fetuses dying of other causes. Thus, it is suggested that basement-membrane thickening may serve as a diagnostic tool for identification of sudden infant death syndrome at autopsy.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-five consecutive cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were morphologically and immunocytochemically studied using monoclonal (anti-B and anti-T cell) and polyclonal (anti-S100 protein and antilysozyme) antibodies with the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method to identify infiltrating lymphocytes (T and B cell) and histiocytes (monocytic/macrophagic and dendritic cells) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A variable density of dendritic cells was found within the tumor nests in 22 (49%) of 45 nasopharyngeal carcinomas examined; infiltrating macrophages were demonstrated in 15 (33%) specimens and around the tumor in almost all cases. Cases with moderate or marked density of dendritic cells (S100+) survived longer than those without such infiltration (mean 5-year survival rates of 31%, 55%, or 64% in patients with absent, moderate, or marked densities, respectively; P less than 0.05). A significant relationship between monocytic/macrophagic cells (lysozyme+) within the tumor and survival was also found (mean 5-year survival rate of 27% or 61% in patients with absent, moderate, or marked densities, respectively). However, lymphocytic infiltration was not statistically related to a better survival. Analyzing lymphocytic infiltration, we found a large prevalence of T cells in the neoplastic tissue without any prognostic significance. These data were correlated to different histological subtypes according to the principal histological classifications of nasopharyngeal carcinomas (Micheau, et al.; World Health Organization; Cologne University) to individualize the scheme which correlates best with prognosis and biological features of nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Our data suggest that, considering dendritic cells and macrophages within cancer nests, nasopharyngeal carcinoma histiotypes can be correlated to patient prognosis.\r"

  ".U": "91232357\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred two patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer were entered into four consecutive phase II trials, all cisplatinum (C-DDP, 100 mg/m2/cycle)-based. The two combinations tried were C-DDP, bleomycin, and fluorouracil (CFB) on 54 patients, and cisplatinum and vindesin in 36 patients (CV). The CFB combination was given with C-DDP by continuous infusion over 96 hours (23 patients) or on day 1 (31 patients). The CV regimen was also given in two different schedules, with VDS at 3 mg/m2/g weekly (12 patients) or by a 96-hour continuous infusion (0.6 to 1.0 mg/m2/d) in 24 patients. The following variables: sex, age, performance status, previous therapy, local recurrence, length of disease-free interval (DFI), distant metastases, weight loss, primary site, histological differentiation, type of chemotherapy, previous chemotherapy, evaluable/measurable disease, erythrosedimentation rate, and their relation with response to chemotherapy (WHO) and survival were submitted to both univariate and multivariate analysis (Cox). Overall response rate (RR:CR + PR) was 25 (28%) of 90. In the CFB protocols, RR was 12 (22%) of 54 vs. 13 (38%) of 36 (P = 0.15, NS) in the CV combination group. For the four different combinations the RR was CFB C-DDPci 7 (30%) of 23, CFB C-DDP 1 hour 5 (16%) of 31, CV VDS weekly 2 (17%) of 12, CV VDSci 11 (45%) of 24. The patient populations were very different, with the latest combination consisting of metastatic patients exclusively. Univariate analysis of multiple variables showed age less than 60 years, PS:0 or 1, no previous therapy, absence of local relapse, metastatic disease, long DFI, and that measurable disease was significant for the probability of response. Median survival was 7 months for the 90 evaluated patients, 5 months for nonresponders, and 9 months for responders (P = 0.01). In the univariate analysis, significant factors for survival were PS:0 or 1, a weight loss below 10%, long DFI, response to chemotherapy, erythrosedimentation rate (ESR) of less than 30 mm/1st hr, presence of bone metastasis, and the number of metastases. Multivariate analysis shows PS, the absence of local relapse, and disease-free interval as significant prognostic factors for response. Multivariate analysis factors of significance for survival were PS, weight loss, and response to chemotherapy. The analysis of the clinical pattern showed an evolution in RR from 3 (8%) of 36 on previously irradiated local recurrent disease to 8 (73%) of 11 in previously untreated patients with metastatic disease at presentation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The 5-year survival rate of histopathological findings was as follows: patients with no pathological evidence of neck metastasis (81%), patients with neck metastasis confined to the lymph node (no ECS) (76%), and patients with ECS (17%). The difference in survival rate between patients with no ECS and patients with ECS was statistically significant (P = .001). Staging classification, T-stage classification, the number of malignant nodes, the diameter of malignant nodes, and combined therapy had no prognostic importance. The most significant factor was the presence of extracapsular spread.\r"

When the bolus was not present the measurements were found to be asymmetrical. When the bolus filled the cavity, the measurements were symmetrical. Therefore, manometric measurements made in the pharynx during bolus flow are not invalidated by variations in the orientation of the catheter.\r"

Surgery was the primary treatment modality in 205 of the 239 cases, with the remaining 34 having surgery to treat radiation therapy failure. Primary tumors were located within the supraglottic region, the glottic region and, less commonly, the pyriform sinus. Ninety-five of the 239 patients either presented with or developed nodal metastases following initial treatment. Of these, only two had tumors within the lymph nodes of the submandibular triangle. This data corroborates impressions that tumors of the larynx and hypopharynx rarely metastasize to the submandibular triangle and that sparing this area during neck dissection for lesions of the larynx would seem justified.\r"

In order to maintain accuracy of delivery, the target must remain fixed in space; hence the skull is engaged by rigid external fixation during treatment. In this report, we document the first extracranial lesion treated with radiosurgery, a recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of Rosenmuller's fossa, and discuss the possible role of radiosurgery in carefully selected head and neck malignancies.\r"

This report studies the efficacy of retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section for control of vertigo due to causes other than Meniere's disease. This report details our experience with 42 patients with a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduced success rate of retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section in these patients is difficult to evaluate, as very few patients have been analyzed with respect to their specific diagnoses. Of patients who underwent retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section for control of vertigo, 23 patients had uncompensated vestibular neuritis and 19 others had a wide range of other diagnoses. For patients with uncompensated vestibular neuritis (n = 23), the physician record noted that 39% of patients were cured and 30% improved. This compares to our series of patients with Meniere's disease (n = 48), where 94% were cured and 2% improved. The true vestibular abnormality may be less reliably identified in patients with uncompensated vestibular neuritis, contributing to the less effective results. Since the development of a vestibular rehabilitation program, retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section for uncompensated vestibular neuritis has been all but abandoned. Retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section appears to achieve a high cure rate in patients with sensorineural hearing loss associated with their vestibular abnormalities. While retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section is helpful for control of vertigo in some diagnoses, a substantial incidence of persistent postoperative dysequilibrium was noted.\r"

Despite this apparent relationship, the literature has failed to address the potential impact of a concurrent laryngocele on surgical decision making. Also, the wide variation in the reported rates of simultaneous occurrence of these two entities is unexplained. We performed whole-organ histopathologic analysis on a laryngeal specimen with bilateral external laryngoceles associated with squamous cell carcinoma and correlated this to computed tomography findings. Based on this information and other reports concerning the pattern of spread of carcinoma within laryngoceles, it appears that supraglottic laryngectomy is oncologically sound in the presence of a laryngocele as long as the usual criteria for this procedure are met.\r"

  ".U": "91232365\r", 
  ".W": "Human facial nerve regeneration was compared in two systems: autologous neural cable grafts (N = 56) and direct end-to-end anastomosis (N = 34). The data were analyzed based on the following criteria: facial symmetry and muscle tone at rest, degree of total facial reinnervation, voluntary motion, synkinesis, and electrophysiologic testing. Facial tone and symmetry at rest, and electrophysiologic tests were similar, while voluntary motion and facial reinnervation were decreased and synkinesis increased in the autologous cable graft repairs. Electrophysiologic tests failed to distinguish between the two repair methods in successful regenerates. Neural cable grafts were associated with more mass movement and less fine precise emotive facial movement. Excellent cable graft repair results diminish with time because of continual progressive synkinesis, which may take up to 4 years to develop. Eight-millimeter neural cable graft repairs of the buccal division of the facial nerve in rabbits (N = 8) demonstrate, at 5 weeks, equal myelinated and more unmyelinated axons than in the normal nerve controls. Neural cable graft repairs demonstrate two features not found in the normal nerve: 1. myelin debris and 2. two subpopulations of axons--extrafascicular and intrafascicular. Myelin debris predisposes towards extrafascicular axon regeneration. Extrafascicular axons are the major neurite regenerates (63%). Intrafascicular axons are the major reinnervators of the distal transected nerve stump. Electrophysiologic studies demonstrate decreased conduction velocities which are related to the number and size of myelinated axonal regenerates. The implications for neurite reinnervation of the autologous cable graft and their role in synkinesis are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "More than a decade has passed since the introduction of the concept that inhibition of platelet function may be helpful in preventing the initiation of thrombus formation. Aspirin has been recognized as inhibiting normal platelet function and the mechanism has been clearly delineated. Legions of patients have been studied to answer the question of whether aspirin is efficacious in the primary prevention of acute myocardial infarction. At the present time, however, a solid, clear answer is not available and firm recommendations cannot be made. A large number of studies evaluating aspirin and other antiplatelet agents in the prevention or delay of recurrent myocardial infarction (secondary prevention) have been completed and those studies reporting a favorable beneficial effect are in the minority. In these secondary prevention studies reporting success, the doses of aspirin employed were large enough to inhibit both the cyclo-oxygenase system and thromboxane A2 production as well as the synthesis of prostacyclin. Thus, in these studies if aspirin is effective in reducing adverse cardiovascular events, its efficacy is being mediated by an unknown mechanism. If the reader of the few studies that report positive results is convinced of the benefit of aspirin, it must be emphasized that thoughtful, cautious patient selection based upon the individual's cardiovascular risk profile must be exercised. Individual variation may exist with respect to aspirin's beneficial effect. It must be absolutely recognized that aspirin or any antiplatelet agent does not in any way substitute for the removal or treatment of coexisting risk factors such as tobacco, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic disease. In contrast to aspirin, control of the above risk factors has been established as beneficial. Aspirin is not free of undesirable side-effects; fatalities secondary to hemorrhage have been reported, and these must be known in detail and understood by both physician and patient before this agent is prescribed in the prophylactic treatment of cardiovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical phenotype of X-linked recessive torsion dystonia was documented in 42 affected individuals from 21 families. In 7 families, there were 9 sibships (core families) with 2 or more affected individuals available for evaluation. The ages of the patients ranged from 29 to 79 years with a mean of 46.2 +/- 10.1 years; the mean age of onset of dystonia was 35.0 +/- 8.0 years with a range of 12 to 48 years; and the mean duration of illness was 11.1 +/- 7.9 years. First manifestations were noted in the lower extremities in 36%, the axial musculature in 29%, the upper extremities in 23%, and in the head in 12% of the cases. The majority of patients displayed gait abnormalities (90%), leg dystonia (79%), oromandibular dystonia (64%), neck dystonia (57%), blepharospasm (57%), and truncal dystonia (52%). The disease generalized in 90% of the cases within 1 to 11 years of onset (median duration, 5 years). Overall, the condition was disabling, but the Fahn-Marsden disability score did not correlate with age of onset, duration of illness, site of onset, rate of generalization, or presence of parkinsonism. Thirty-six percent of the cases displayed at least 1 of the following \"parkinsonian symptoms\": bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, loss of postural reflexes and a shuffling gait. Parkinsonism was diagnosed as definite in 14%, probable in 2%, and possible in 19% of the cases. Given this high association of dystonia and parkinsonism, we propose to call the disorder X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome (XDP).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Three cases of pyogenic sacroiliitis are described, and the English literature from 1878 to 1990 reviewed, for a total of 166 cases. In 1 patient the source of infection was identified at the site of an intravenous line; 1 patient had 2 risk factors for developing the disease (pregnancy and intravenous drug use); and a third patient had no source of infection and no associated risk factors. The diagnosis of pyogenic sacroiliitis was made in each patient by history, physical examination, and positive skeletal scintigraphy or computed tomography of the sacroiliac joint. The infectious agent causing septic arthritis was identified by fine-needle aspiration of the sacroiliac joint under fluoroscopic guidance. Two of the 3 patients also had an open biopsy of the sacroiliac joint--one to confirm the organism causing septic arthritis, and the other for surgical drainage of the infected sacroiliac joint. Cultures from all 3 patients grew organisms uncommon for this disease, and all were treated for 6 weeks with intravenous antibiotics. In all patients pain diminished after treatment. Pyogenic sacroiliitis is a relatively rare condition (1-2 cases reported/year) that may be clinically difficult to diagnose unless the clinician is familiar with the disease. A prompt diagnosis can prevent significant morbidity and reduce serious complication. Major predisposing factors include intravenous drug use, trauma, or an identifiable focus of infection elsewhere, but 44% of patients have no predisposing or associated factors identified. Most patients present with an acute febrile illness with pain in the buttocks and pain on movement that stresses the affected sacroiliac joint. There is no specific blood test which points to the diagnosis of pyogenic sacroiliitis, although the erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be greater than 100 mm/hr. The diagnostic procedure of choice is bone scan with attention to the early perfusion phase, which usually localizes the affected sacroiliac joint. Unilateral involvement is the rule. In patients whose blood cultures fail to reveal a causative organism, fluoroscopic guided fine-needle aspiration of the sacroiliac joint under general anesthesia may help to identify the organism. If all cultures are negative, open biopsy of the sacroiliac joint may be required. Open biopsy should also be done if sequestration or an abscess is formed, or if the patient fails to respond to antibiotic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Important epidemiologic risk factors were the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products or treatment with nutritional therapy that included raw calf-liver extracts. Nearly all patients had underlying chronic diseases. Like Salmonella choleraesuis, S. dublin infections were associated with a high incidence of bacteremia (91%), metastatic sites of infection (30%), and mortality (26%) relative to other non-typhoidal Salmonellae. This pattern of disease expression may be related to a plasmid-encoded virulence factor common to both of these organisms.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Surgical or catheter ablation of accessory pathways by means of high-energy shocks serves as definitive therapy for patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome but has substantial associated morbidity and mortality. Radiofrequency current, an alternative energy source for ablation, produces smaller lesions without adverse effects remote from the site where current is delivered. We conducted this study to develop catheter techniques for delivering radiofrequency current to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with accessory-pathway ablation. METHODS. Radiofrequency current (mean power, 30.9 +/- 5.3 W) was applied through a catheter electrode positioned against the mitral or tricuspid annulus or a branch of the coronary sinus; when possible, delivery was guided by catheter recordings of accessory-pathway activation. Ablation was attempted in 166 patients with 177 accessory pathways (106 pathways in the left free wall, 13 in the anteroseptal region, 43 in the posteroseptal region, and 15 in the right free wall). RESULTS. Accessory-pathway conduction was eliminated in 164 of 166 patients (99 percent) by a median of three applications of radiofrequency current. During a mean follow-up (+/- SD) of 8.0 +/- 5.4 months, preexcitation or atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia returned in 15 patients (9 percent). All underwent a second, successful ablation. Electrophysiologic study 3.1 +/- 1.9 months after ablation in 75 patients verified the absence of accessory-pathway conduction in all. Complications of radiofrequency-current application occurred in three patients (1.8 percent): atrioventricular block (one patient), pericarditis (one), and cardiac tamponade (one) after radiofrequency current was applied in a small branch of the coronary sinus. CONCLUSIONS. Radiofrequency current is highly effective in ablating accessory pathways, with low morbidity and no mortality.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. We conducted this study to determine the feasibility of an abbreviated therapeutic approach to the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, in which the diagnosis is established and radiofrequency ablation carried out during a single electrophysiologic test. METHODS. One hundred six consecutive patients were referred for the management of documented, symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (66 patients) or the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (40 patients). All agreed to undergo a diagnostic electrophysiologic test and catheter ablation with radiofrequency current. No patient had had such a test previously. RESULTS. Among the 66 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, the mechanism was found to be atrioventricular nodal reentry in 46 (70 percent) (typical in 44 and atypical in 2), atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia involving a concealed accessory pathway in 16 (24 percent), atrial tachycardia in 2 (3 percent), and noninducible paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in 2 (3 percent). A successful long-term outcome was achieved in 57 of 62 patients (92 percent) with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in whom ablation was attempted and in 37 of 40 patients (93 percent) with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The only complications were one instance of occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery, leading to acute myocardial infarction, and one instance of complete atrioventricular block. The mean (+/- SD) duration of the electrophysiologic procedures was 114 +/- 55 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. The diagnosis and cure of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome during a single electrophysiologic test are feasible and practical and have a favorable risk-benefit ratio. This abbreviated therapeutic approach may eliminate the need for serial electropharmacologic testing, long-term drug therapy, antitachycardia pacemakers, and surgical ablation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Although cigarette smoking is the leading avoidable cause of premature death in middle age, some have claimed that no association is present among older persons. METHODS. We prospectively examined the relation of cigarette-smoking habits with mortality from all causes, cardiovascular causes, and cancer among 7178 persons 65 years of age or older without a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cancer who lived in one of three communities: East Boston, Massachusetts; Iowa and Washington counties, Iowa; and New Haven, Connecticut. At the time of the initial interview, prevalence rates of smoking in the three communities ranged from 5.2 to 17.8 percent among women and from 14.2 to 25.8 percent among men. During five years of follow-up there were 1442 deaths, 729 due to cardiovascular disease and 316 due to cancer. RESULTS. In both sexes, rates of total mortality among current smokers were twice what they were among participants who had never smoked. Relative risks, as adjusted for age and community, were 2.1 among the men (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 2.7) and 1.8 among the women (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.4). Current smokers had higher rates of cardiovascular mortality than those who had never smoked (as adjusted for age and community, the relative risk was 2.0 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.9] among the men and 1.6 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.3] among the women), as well as increased rates of cancer mortality (relative risk, 2.4 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.1] among the men and 2.4 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 3.9] among the women). In both sexes, former smokers had rates of cardiovascular mortality similar to those of the participants who had never smoked, regardless of age at cessation, whereas the rates for all cancers, as well as smoking-related cancers, remained elevated among men who had once smoked. CONCLUSIONS. Our prospective findings indicate that the mortality hazards of smoking extend well into later life, and suggest that cessation will continue to improve life expectancy in older people.\r"

  ".U": "91232557\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Many patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have an increase in the glomerular filtration rate and renal enlargement early in the course of their disease. Both these changes may be risk factors for the later development of diabetic nephropathy. Their cause is not known, but they could be due to augmented renal responses to the increase in plasma amino acid concentrations that occurs when dietary protein intake is high, a factor known to increase glomerular filtration and renal blood flow in normal subjects. METHODS. We measured the glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow after an overnight fast and during an infusion of amino acids in 12 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 9 normal subjects. The diabetic patients were studied when they were hyperglycemic, when they were euglycemic after an insulin infusion for 36 hours, and after intensive insulin therapy for 3 weeks. Kidney volume was measured by ultrasonography before and after the period of intensive insulin therapy. RESULTS. The glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were normal after fasting when the patients were hyperglycemic (mean [+/- SE] fasting plasma glucose level, 11.5 +/- 0.7 mmol per liter). After the amino acid infusion, these values increased more in the patients (glomerular filtration rate, 2.65 +/- 0.07 ml per second per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; renal plasma flow, 13.30 +/- 0.68 ml per second per 1.73 m2; P less than 0.05 for both) than in the normal subjects (2.25 +/- 0.08 and 11.20 +/- 0.65 ml per second per 1.73 m2, respectively). The 36-hour infusion of insulin in the diabetic patients did not alter the glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow either before or during the amino acid infusion. After three weeks of intensive insulin therapy (fasting plasma glucose level, 5.3 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter), the glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow after the amino acid infusion (2.33 +/- 0.03 and 11.30 +/- 0.43 ml per second per 1.73 m2, respectively) were similar to those in the normal subjects. The kidney volumes in the normal subjects and the patients with diabetes were 219 +/- 14 and 312 +/- 14 ml per 1.73 m2, respectively (P less than 0.01); the volume decreased to 267 +/- 22 ml per 1.73 m2 (P less than 0.001) in the diabetic patients after three weeks of intensive insulin therapy, which was not significantly different from the volume in the normal subjects (P = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS. Conventionally treated diabetic patients who have normal renal function while fasting have augmented renal hemodynamic responses to increased plasma amino acid concentrations. The concomitant decrease in these hemodynamic responses and in kidney size with strict glycemic control suggests that these phenomena are related and influenced by the metabolic state.\r"

  ".U": "91232558\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Treatment of acute Kawasaki syndrome with a four-day course of intravenous gamma globulin, together with aspirin, has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in preventing coronary-artery lesions and reducing systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that therapy with a single, very high dose of gamma globulin would be at least as effective as the standard regimen. METHODS. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving 549 children with acute Kawasaki syndrome. The children were assigned to receive gamma globulin either as a single infusion of 2 g per kilogram of body weight over 10 hours or as daily infusions of 400 mg per kilogram for four consecutive days. Both treatment groups received aspirin (100 mg per kilogram per day through the 14th day of illness, then 3 to 5 mg per kilogram per day). RESULTS. The relative prevalence of coronary abnormalities, adjusted for age and sex, among patients treated with the four-day regimen, as compared with those treated with the single-infusion regimen, was 1.94 (95 percent confidence limits, 1.01 and 3.71) two weeks after enrollment and 1.84 (95 percent confidence limits, 0.89 and 3.82) seven weeks after enrollment. Children treated with the single-infusion regimen had lower mean temperatures while hospitalized (day 2, P less than 0.001; day 3, P = 0.004), as well as a shorter mean duration of fever (P = 0.028). Furthermore, in the single-infusion group the laboratory indexes of acute inflammation moved more rapidly toward normal, including the adjusted serum albumin level (P = 0.004), alpha 1-antitrypsin level (P = 0.007), and C-reactive protein level (P = 0.017). Lower IgG levels on day 4 were associated with a higher prevalence of coronary lesions (P = 0.005) and with a greater degree of systemic inflammation. The two groups had a similar incidence of adverse effects (including new or worsening congestive heart failure in nine children), which occurred in 2.7 percent of the children overall. All the adverse effects were transient. CONCLUSIONS. In children with acute Kawasaki disease, a single large dose of intravenous gamma globulin is more effective than the conventional regimen of four smaller daily doses and is equally safe.\r"

A recently isolated gene, termed SRY in humans and Sry in mouse, has many of the genetic and biological properties expected of a Y-located testis-determining gene. It is now shown that Sry on a 14-kilobase genomic DNA fragment is sufficient to induce testis differentiation and subsequent male development when introduced into chromosomally female mouse embryos.\r"

  ".W": "European agriculture originated in the Near East about 9,000 years ago. The Neolithic reached almost all areas suitable for agriculture by 5,000 yr BP (before present). The routes and times of the spread of agriculture through Europe are relatively well established, but not its manner of spreading. This could have been by cultural diffusion with few genetic consequences. By contrast, Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza proposed that the spread of farming increased local population densities, causing demic expansion into new territory and diffusive gene flow between the neolithic farmers and mesolithic groups. We have now tested observed genetic patterns against expectations derived from the demic expansion hypothesis. We found significant partial correlations of genetic distances with a distance matrix especially designed to represent the spread of agriculture on that continent, when geographic distances are held constant. These findings support the hypothesis of Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza and invite further investigation into Renfrew's hypothesis on the origin of the Indo-European languages.\r"

  ".W": "Autoimmune diseases occur when T lymphocytes become activated on recognizing self antigen linked to the autologous class II molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The resulting complex of antigen MHC T-cell receptor could be a target for treatment of autoimmune diseases. Studies in which each component is blocked separately might be limited by interference in non-relevant immune responses that either use the same set of T-cell-receptor V gene segments or are linked to the same MHC. We report here an attack by a specific antibody on the unique antigenic site formed by the binding of two components of the trimolecular complex, the autoantigen bound to the self MHC. We tested its effect in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an acute neurological autoimmune disease which is widely regarded as a model for autoimmune disorders and which is mediated by CD4+ T cells recognizing myelin basic protein (BP), or its peptides, in association with self Ia. We made monoclonal antibodies which bound only the complex of BP and I-As. These antibodies blocked the proliferative response in vitro to the encephalitogenic determinant of BP and reduced the response to intact BP, without affecting the response to a nonrelevant antigen-purified protein derivative of tuberculin presented on syngeneic macrophages. They also inhibited experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in H-2s mice. Hence, antibodies directed specifically to the autoantigen-Ia complex, may offer a highly selective and effective treatment in autoimmune diseases.\r"

It is expressed at the blastocyst stage of development, and accumulates to high levels in tissues of endodermal and mesodermal origin (H. Kim, unpublished result). After birth the gene is expressed in all tissues except skeletal muscle. It lacks a common open reading frame in the 2.5-kilobase RNA, but has considerable nucleotide sequence similarity between the genes of rodents and humans. Expression of the gene in transgenic mice results in late prenatal lethality, suggesting that the dosage of its gene product is strictly controlled. The H19 gene maps to the distal segment of mouse chromosome 7, in a region that is parentally imprinted, a process by which genes are differentially expressed on the maternal and paternal chromosomes. We have now used an RNase protection assay that can distinguish between H19 alleles in four subspecies of Mus, to demonstrate that the H19 gene is parentally imprinted, with the active copy derived from the mother. This assay will be of general use in assaying allele-specific gene expression.\r"

But for the many microorganisms that have never been cultivated, DNA amplification in vitro using the polymerase chain reaction is now making their genes accessible. Here we use this technique to study bacteria of the genus Holospora, which live in ciliates and whose phylogenetic relationship has remained unknown because they are impossible to cultivate. Species of Holospora are highly infectious and live in the nuclei of their specific host cells: H. elegans and H. undulata infect micronuclei of Paramecium caudatum, whereas H. obtusa infects the macronucleus in other strains of the same host species; Holospora species have a common developmental cycle. We have amplified, cloned and sequenced gene fragments encoding ribosomal RNA of H. obtusa. The phylogenetic position of H. obtusa in the alpha group of Proteobacteria was determined by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. The sequences were then used to design species- as well as genus-specific rRNA hybridization probes, which enabled us to detect and differentiate individual cells of the endosymbionts in situ. The large amount of rRNA in the cells indicates a high physiological activity of the endosymbionts in the host nuclei.\r"

  ".U": "91232585\r", 
  ".W": "Many extracellular proteins with diverse functions contain domains similar to epidermal growth factor (EGF), a number of which have a consensus Asp/Asn, Asp/Asn, Asp*/Asn*, Tyr/Phe (where the asterisk denotes a beta-hydroxylated residue). These include the coagulation factors IX and X, proteins with two EGF-like domains, the first of which contains the consensus residues. The first EGF-like domain of human factor IX contains a calcium-binding site, which is believed to be responsible for one of the high-affinity sites detected in this protein. Similar results have been obtained for bovine factor X. We have now used protein engineering and 1H-NMR techniques to investigate the importance of individual consensus residues for ligand binding. Measurement of a calcium-dependent Tyr 69 shift in the isolated first EGF-like domain from human factor IX demonstrates that Asp 47, Asp 49, and Asp 64 are directly involved in this binding. Gln 50, whose importance has previously been overlooked, is also involved in this binding. Two mutations in this domain, Asp 47----Glu, and Asp 64----Asn, present in patients with haemophilia B, reduce calcium binding to the domain greater than 4-fold and greater than 1,000-fold, respectively. Furthermore, the defective calcium binding of Asn 64 can be partially rescued by the compensatory mutation Gln 50----Glu. This latter mutation, when introduced singly more than doubles the affinity of the domain for calcium. This study thus defines residues involved in a new type of calcium-binding site and provides strong circumstantial evidence for calcium-binding motifs in many extracellular proteins, including the developmentally important proteins of Drosophila, notch, delta and crumbs.\r"

One hundred thirteen patients scheduled for low transverse cervical cesarean were randomized to either closure of both the visceral and parietal peritoneum with absorbable suture (N = 59) or no peritoneal closure (N = 54). Patients were cared for in the usual postoperative manner without reference to treatment group. There were no demographic differences between the groups and no differences in method(s) of anesthesia, operative indication(s), or use of peripartum epidural narcotics. The incidence of fever, endometritis, or wound infection was similar between groups. There were no differences in the number of patients requiring parenteral narcotic analgesia or in the number of doses per patient. The number of oral analgesic doses was significantly greater with closure than without (P = .014). The frequency with which postoperative ileus was diagnosed in each group was similar, and there was no difference regarding the day on which patients were advanced to liquid or select diets. Bowel stimulants were administered more frequently to the closure than to non-closure patients (P = .03). The average operating time was shorter for the open group than for the closure group (P less than .005). We conclude that non-closure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum at low transverse cervical cesarean delivery appears to have no adverse effect on immediate postoperative recovery, may decrease postoperative narcotic requirements, allows less complicated return of bowel function, and provides a simplified and shorter surgical procedure.\r"

During the first 2 years (1983-1985), 237 twin pregnancies were delivered with a policy of elective hospitalization when twin pregnancy was diagnosed between 24-32 weeks' gestation. When possible, elective hospitalization started at 24 weeks' gestation. Electively admitted women remained hospitalized until 34 weeks' gestation, at which time they were discharged unless complications developed requiring continued hospitalization. During 1985-1987, 285 women with twin gestations were intentionally managed as outpatients unless intercurrent complications required hospitalization. A total of 211 twin pregnancies was excluded from analysis because the women did not present for prenatal care (19%) or were undiagnosed until delivery (22%). Of the remaining 311 pregnancies available for study, 134 were managed when the elective admission policy prevailed and 177 when this policy was not in effect. Although the elective admission policy did result in a small reduction in the incidence of low birth weight among the 58 pregnancies hospitalized electively (mean [+/- SEM] gestational age at elective hospitalization 27.7 +/- 0.3 weeks) compared with outpatient management, this policy did not result in an improvement in prematurity (32 versus 36%; P greater than .05) or perinatal morbidity as reflected by requirement for neonatal intensive care (12 versus 11%; P greater than .05) and mechanical ventilation (8 versus 9%; P greater than .05).

This is a report of the experience with monoamniotic twins of 20 or more weeks' gestation at the University of Iowa Hospitals from 1961-1989. Twenty monoamniotic twin pregnancies were compared with 40 monochorionic, diamniotic controls regarding antepartum and intrapartum complications. Overall, monoamniotic twins were delivered earlier, were more likely to die in utero, and had lower birth weights than diamniotic twins. When only live-born twins were considered, however, there were no differences in gestational age at delivery, birth weight, or 5-minute Apgar scores. No fetal death occurred after 32 weeks, suggesting that prophylactic preterm delivery may not be indicated in all cases. Labor and vaginal delivery were not associated with an increased risk of fetal death.\r"

Femoral bone mineral density was also measured twice in 32 non-pregnant controls matched to the cases for weight, height, age, and parity. There was no significant mean bone mineral density loss in cases compared with controls (P greater than .63). Pregnant women with smaller body size, expressed as Quetelet index, were more likely to have femoral neck bone mass increase than their matched controls (P less than .03). This study provides evidence that fetal demand for calcium has a minimal effect on bone mineral density at parturition. Smaller women may experience a slight increase in femoral bone mineral density compared with controls.\r"

We hypothesized that insulin-dependent diabetic patients attending a pre-conception program would have improved glycemic control compared with insulin-dependent diabetic patients who enrolled after conception and would have better pregnancy outcome, with fewer spontaneous abortions and fewer major malformations. Ninety-nine pregnant insulin-dependent diabetic patients were recruited before reaching 9 weeks' gestation and were followed prospectively throughout pregnancy. Twenty-eight had attended a pre-conception clinic to optimize glycemic control (study group) and 71 had enrolled after conception (control group). Early glycemic control was significantly better in the study group: Glycohemoglobin values at the first prenatal visit and at 9 and 14 weeks' gestation were significantly lower than in the control group. The rate of spontaneous abortion was significantly lower in the study group (7%) than in the controls (24%). There was one major malformation in the control group and none in the study group. We conclude that patients with insulin-dependent diabetes attending a pre-conception program have a decreased rate of early pregnancy loss compared with those receiving prenatal care early in pregnancy.\r"

Thirty-eight pregnancies in 25 patients with cystic fibrosis are presented. Twelve of the 25 mothers were pancreatic-sufficient. Despite previous reports of the hazards of pregnancy in cystic fibrosis, we found that pregnancy was well tolerated by the vast majority of our patients and had little effect on their pulmonary and nutritional status. Therapeutic abortion for medical indications was required in two pregnancies. The incidence of prematurity and the neonatal mortality rate were low, and no congenital abnormalities occurred. We conclude that pregnancy can be tolerated by the majority of cystic fibrosis patients, particularly those who are pancreatic-sufficient.\r"

  ".W": "Although retained placenta is a major cause of postpartum hemorrhage, there is no general agreement regarding when manual placental extraction is indicated to prevent hemorrhage. We sought to determine the following: 1) what duration of the third stage of labor is abnormal, 2) what duration is associated with complications, and 3) what antecedent conditions are associated with prolonged third stage. We studied 12,979 consecutive, singleton vaginal deliveries over an 11-year period. Third-stage duration had a log-normal distribution, with a geometric mean of 6.8 minutes, a median of 6 minutes, and an interquartile range of 4-10 minutes. A third stage of 30 minutes or longer occurred in 3.3% of the deliveries. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, transfusion, and D&C remained constant in third stages less than 30 minutes, then rose progressively, reaching a plateau at 75 minutes. The increase in these complications after 30 minutes was observed with both spontaneously delivered and manually extracted placentas. In a logistic regression analysis, factors significantly associated with prolonged third stage included: preterm delivery (odds ratio 3.81), delivery in a labor bed (odds ratio 2.17), preeclampsia (odds ratio 1.76), augmented labor (odds ratio 1.47), and nulliparity (odds ratio 1.45). Because there was no increase in hemorrhage until the third stage exceeded 30 minutes, we suggest that in the absence of bleeding, manual placental extraction is not indicated until 30 minutes have elapsed.\r"

  ".W": "Repetitive hydatidiform mole was observed in four pregnancies. The pregnancies presented with heavy bleeding and vomiting, but the post-evacuation courses were uncomplicated, with rapid regression of serum hCG levels. Cytogenetic investigations, analyses of restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and flow cytometry in three pregnancies were consistent with diploid, biparental conception as the origin of fetal tissue and molar and nonmolar villi. In one pregnancy, the analyses of cytogenetic markers suggested the coexistence of two different cell lines of dizygotic, biparental origin, whereas DNA analysis was consistent with a single conception. With incomplete genetic information, a hydatidiform mole with coexistent normal fetus is generally considered to result from dizygous twinning comprising an androgenetic complete mole and a normal conception. In the present gestations, the results based on several techniques applied on numerous samples from different tissues render this possibility unlikely. Some of the contradictions between histologic and cytogenetic classifications of hydatidiform mole may be explained by diploid, biparental partial mole, which seems to constitute a separate subgroup within hydatidiform mole. Following chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, continued pregnancy may be considered, depending on prenatal diagnosis including genetic marker analysis.\r"

A multiple linear regression analysis was used to control for the possible confounding effect of perinatal factors (birth weight, gestational age, serum bilirubin levels, birth order) and demographic characteristics (ethnic origin, paternal education, social class). The sensitivity and positive predictive value of a low 1-minute Apgar score were 8 and 8% and of a low 5-minute Apgar score 1.5 and 5%, respectively. Low Apgar scores are poorly correlated with long-term intellectual outcome.\r"

Samples were collected before, 3 hours after, and 3 days after the Shirodkar procedure. Uterine activity was recorded by external tocography twice daily for 30 minutes. Twenty-eight women with uncomplicated pregnancy and commensurate gestational age served as controls. Cervical length, measured by ultrasonography, was significantly shorter before cerclage (36 +/- 2 mm) than after cerclage (43 +/- 2 mm) or compared with controls (48 +/- 1 mm). Bishop scores ranged from 3-6 (median 4) in the cerclage group and 0-1 (median 0) in controls. Fifteen cerclage patients and one control delivered preterm 5-22 weeks after the procedure. Initial plasma PGFM levels were significantly higher in cerclage patients than in controls. The cerclage procedure caused an immediate rise in plasma PGFM and a subsequent fall below initial levels to control values. Neither the initial levels of PGFM nor the increments 3 hours after cerclage correlated with the outcome of pregnancy. By contrast, plasma oxytocin levels before cerclage were significantly higher in patients who subsequently delivered preterm than in those who delivered at term. Cerclage resulted in a significant fall in plasma oxytocin at 3 hours in patients with preterm delivery, but after 3 days the oxytocin levels had returned to the precerclage values. Patients who had increased uterine contractions had significantly higher plasma oxytocin levels but lower PGFM levels than those without contractions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A cross-sectional transvaginal ultrasound study was conducted in 137 normal pregnancies with gestational ages ranging from 5-12 weeks. Several biometric measurements were obtained throughout pregnancy, including the three diameters of the gestational sac, the crown-rump length, and the yolk sac. In addition, the appearance of the embryo heartbeat and embryo body movements were evaluated. Linear relationships were found between the mean gestational sac diameters and gestational age (r = 0.911; P less than .00001) and between mean gestational sac growth and crown-rump length growth (r = 0.926; P less than .0001). A gestational sac could be identified at 5 weeks' gestation; embryo heartbeat was imaged when the mean gestational sac diameter measured 2 cm, and embryo body movements could be seen when the mean gestational sac diameter reached 3 cm. In the present study, embryo heartbeat was identifiable after 6 weeks and 4 days with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.1%, positive predictive value of 96.9%, and negative predictive value of 100%. The embryo body movements, which were absent before 7 weeks' gestation, were observed after 8 weeks' gestation with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 92.8%, positive predictive value of 94.3%, and negative predictive value of 100%. With identification by transvaginal sonographic evaluation, the following can serve as markers of normal embryo growth: a mean gestational sac diameter greater than 2 cm in the presence of the embryo heartbeat, or a mean sac diameter measurement greater than 3 cm in the presence of embryo movement.\r"

Maternal perception of vibrator-elicited fetal movement was poor compared with ultrasound scan observation. Regardless of gestational age or risk status, the mothers perceived 27-75% fewer movements than observed with ultrasound scan. In addition, maternal movement perceptions on vibrator versus no-stimulus control trials were not reliable until 29-32 weeks' gestation, with the percentage of movement responses increasing across gestation from 11 to 48%. In contrast, ultrasound scan observations of movement were reliable on vibrator compared with no-stimulus control trials from 26 weeks, with the percentage of movement responses increasing from 22% at 23-25 weeks to 94% at 35-36 weeks. We conclude that maternal perceptions of fetal movements cannot be substituted for ultrasound scan observations for accurate assessment of fetal movements during vibroacoustic stimulation testing.\r"

The mean ratio was 13.7% (fifth and 95th percentiles of 11.9 and 15.9%, respectively); the median ratio was 13.6%. Forty-two patients had repeat measurements and the ratio did not change. This ratio is gestational age-independent; however, further investigation is needed to determine its application in the assessment of fetal growth abnormalities.\r"
