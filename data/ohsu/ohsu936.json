There were no operative deaths. Open aortic anastomosis facilitated repair of the aortic arch without clamping the arch tributaries, and embolism due to particulate debris from clamping of the arch vessels was eliminated. Retrograde cerebral perfusion during profound hypothermic circulatory arrest is a simplified technique that may protect the brain. This method offers advantages over previously described methods, particularly in obviating dissection of the arch tributaries and the clamping thereof, and in protecting the central nervous system.\r"

Thirty-one patients received a total of 118 units of blood products averaging 2.23 units of red cells (Group II). The average red cell transfusion rate for all patients was 0.7 units per patient. The median age for Group I was 61 and Group II was 68 years (p less than 0.05). The average number of grafts was the same for both (3 per patient) with 75% of Group I and 58% of Group II receiving internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts (p less than 0.05). Twelve of the Group II patients who received intraoperative transfusions on cardiopulmonary bypass to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels were older and had lower admission hematocrits: 36 +/- 0.8% compared to 41 +/- 0.5% for all other patients (p less than 0.05). Average postoperative blood loss was 889 +/- 38 ml for Group I and 1077 +/- 104 ml for Group II (p less than 0.05). Increased hemorrhage was correlated with bypass time and IMA use but not with preoperative heparin administration, pre-existing risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, etc.), bleeding time, post-bypass clotting time, age or number of grafts. Two patients in Group II and none in Group I required exploration for excessive postoperative hemorrhage. Mortality rate was 2% (both in Group II, neither transfusion related). Discharge hematocrits were the same for all at 29.4 +/- 0.4%. Among anemia-related postoperative symptoms, only sinus tachycardia was significantly higher in Group I (20%) compared to Group II (6.5%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the usefulness of transesophageal echocardiography as a perioperative monitor in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, 149 consecutive patients were studied since 1985. Left ventricular function was assessed by measurement of left ventricular dimension and ejection fraction in patients with valvular disease. This monitoring was useful in detecting the changes in left ventricular performance in patients with volume overload and in managing patients in the early postoperative period. Cardiac tamponade was clearly demonstrated before changes in electrocardiogram and hemodynamic data. In 27 patients, transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography was used to confirm that there was no residual regurgitation immediately after valvular reconstructive surgery. Transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography was also useful in detecting the entry of false lumen before surgery in 7 patients with dissecting aortic aneurysm. There were no unsuccessful introductions, no traumatic or thermal injuries, 18 patients (12.1%) with hoarseness and 5 patients (3.4%) with transient arrhythmia. In conclusion, transesophageal echocardiography provides a good imaging window to the heart and great vessels perioperatively. This expedient, safe informative imaging method can be used more routinely in patients during surgery.\r"

Since coronary flow is largely dependent on variable factors the stable value of resistance seems more appropriate for comparison. A simple method has been developed for intraoperative measurement of resistance in the respective coronary bed. Pressure is recorded in the saphenous graft by an electromanometer during continuous flushing with known amounts of blood, and resistance is calculated instantaneously. The procedure is very simple and takes less than one minute. The quality of the saphenous vein itself can be assessed simultaneously by the same method. Resistances were measured during coronary surgery in over 500 saphenous grafts. The results were highly reproducible and comparable. Excellent flows can be expected if resistance is below 200 Peripheral Resistance Units (PRU); if this is over 800 PRU flow is very poor.\r"

(1974) found a threshold relationship between cortical cerebral blood flow and cortical somatosensory evoked potential (SEP). As the local blood flow fell below about 16 ml/100 g/min a progressive reduction occurred in the amplitude of the cortical evoked potential (N20/P25), implying a fundamental failure of neuronal function in the somatosensory cortex. We have monitored cortical SEP (somatosensory evoked potential) during 734 CEA's (carotid endarterectomies) in order to find an index of risk of incipient cerebral ischemia during carotid cross-clamping, to determine the need for shunting and the causes of early irreversible neurologic deficits. In 59 cases evaluation of SEP was not possible because of technical difficulties. During 586 CEA's no alteration of SEP occurred. However, 4 patients had an immediate postoperative neurologic deficit, while the SEP remained normal. Abnormal SEP occurred in 89 cases and in 6 of these an irreversible loss of SEP was seen. These patients awoke with a new neurologic deficit. We found a reversible abnormal SEP in 83 cases. Reversible changes of SEP occurred mainly during carotid clamping. The diagnostic sensitivity of intraoperative SEP monitoring in predicting neurologic outcome was 60% with a specificity of 100%.\r"

Growing evidence, however, indicates that the incidence of paraplegia is higher with this method and may outweigh its advantages. With this in mind, we have examined our experience with 40 patients who underwent repair of aortic transection from 1975-1988. The operated patients in our series all survived. Fourteen were repaired using some type of bypass or shunt, none of whom developed paraplegia. The remaining 26 patients were repaired without a shunt and 9 (34.6%) developed paraplegia or paraparesis (p less than 0.02). Paraplegia was related to aortic occlusion time (p less than 0.002). It did not occur in 11 patients with times less than 27 minutes, but happened in 2 of 8 patients with times between 28 and 35 minutes and in all 7 patients with clamp times over 35 minutes. These data suggest that shunt or bypass should be used in most cases of aortic transection.\r"

Preoperative diagnostic methods are excretory urography, showing medial deviation, ultrasonography and CT-scanning of the abdominal aorta. All patients with an inflammatory aneurysm should undergo aortic replacement to prevent rupture and achieve pain relief. Ureterolysis in cases of hydronephrosis is strongly recommended and may be performed safely and with excellent results.\r"

  ".W": "Late occlusion of an aortofemoral bypass graft is usually caused by fibrointimal hyperplasia or progressive atherosclerosis. Several surgical approaches have been advocated in order to minimize the operative risk, to correct the impaired inflow and to provide a satisfactory outflow. In the last 16 years, in the Institute of Vascular Surgery and Angiology of the University of Milan, we have operated upon 182 consecutive thrombosed grafts. Inflow was restored by performing a graft limb thrombectomy using a Fogarty balloon catheter and simultaneously employing an endarterectomy ring stripper to dislodge tenaciously adherent fibrinous material and thrombotic plug. As the superficial femoral artery was generally occluded, usually a good outflow was achieved by profundaplasty in 101 cases (55.5%) or direct bypass (interposition graft), to a more distal segment of the profunda femoris artery in 55 cases (30.2%). Concomitant popliteal or tibial revascularization was done in the remaining 26 cases (14.3%) when pre-operative or intra-operative findings suggested an inadequate collateral network through the profunda femoris artery. Early re-occlusion, which occurred in 14 cases (7.6%), generally due to insufficient outflow, was corrected by additional intervention in 7 cases (3.8%), while 7 legs were amputated for extensive atherosclerotic disease. Six patients died giving a mortality rate of 3.3%. This low rate in a high risk population is probably related to our policy of operating under loco-regional anaesthesia. Long term results, with a patency rate of 62.0% at 3 years and 60.2% at 5 years (life table method), prove that this operation is a durable procedure for correction of graft limb thrombosis.\r"

Computed tomography (CT) has become a common method of preoperative evaluation of aortic disease. Its reliability in providing accurate information regarding aneurysmal size, configuration, and extension, as well as the presence of intraluminal thrombus and involvement of the renal and iliac arteries, has been demonstrated. Simultaneous visualization of the major adjacent venous structures with the use of contrast enhancement is obtained, but anatomic variants can be overlooked because they are commonly subtle and considered incidental. The preoperative diagnosis of these venous abnormalities is significant to the vascular surgeon. Such information can be accurately and reliably acquired with the present CT techniques without the need for further diagnostic studies.\r"

We treated five patients with chronic visceral ischemia and lesions extending beyond the orifice using a retroperitoneal approach. Exposure was obtained with a left flank incision through the tenth interspace. The left crus of the diaphragm was divided in order to control the supraceliac aorta. The mesenteric vessels were identified and dissected until their entrance into the peritoneum. There were no difficulties in exposing the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) as it coursed under the pancreas and over the duodenum for an approximate length of 5 to 10 cm. The uncinate process of the pancreas was not a limiting factor for exposure of the SMA in this region and further distal exposure could be obtained by incising the peritoneum. The trifurcation of the celiac artery and the splenic artery were accessible through this exposure; however, only the first centimeter of the hepatic and gastric branches could be reached. Revascularization was performed with endarterectomy (2 patients) and bypass (3 patients). Bowel viability was assessed at the conclusion of the procedure by incising the peritoneum. There were no complications from this exposure and no patient required reoperation for ischemic bowel. We conclude that the left retroperitoneal approach is not only acceptable for orifice lesions but is also applicable for distal disease.\r"

  ".W": "While vascular endothelial cells are repeatedly stretched by the pulsatile nature of cardiac output, in vitro models traditionally used to study vascular biology involve static culture techniques. We have recently shown that pulsatile stretching of endothelial cells in culture will increase their rates of proliferation and regulate their secretion of macromolecules. The aim of this study was to determine whether membrane adenylate cyclase is involved in intracellular signalling during pulsatile stress. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were seeded on flexible-bottomed culture wells (3 x 10(5) cells/25 mm well) and allowed to attach for 48 hours. The culture wells were placed in a vacuum-operated stress providing instrument and subjected to 0.5 s of 24% strain, 0.5 s relaxation (60 cycles/min) for 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 minutes (N = 24 wells/time point). Cells were homogenized and a crude membrane preparation (27,000 x g) was assayed for adenylate cyclase under basal and forskolin (100 microM) stimulated conditions. The results indicate that there is a time-dependent increase in both basal and stimulated adenylate cyclase with cyclic deformation and suggest that there may be a \"stretch receptor\" coupled to adenylate cyclase which can modulate endothelial cell function with hemodynamic changes.\r"

An arteriovenous fistula was constructed at the distal anastomosis on one randomly selected side in each animal while the contralateral graft served as a control. Graft follow-up ranged between 8 and 12 months in all animals. Serial arteriography was performed to confirm graft and fistula patency and demonstrated persistence of antegrade flow into the arterial tree distal to all patent bypasses. Femoral intraarterial pressures distal to patent grafts were identical on both sides in each animal throughout the study. Cumulative life-table patency rates showed higher patency for the arteriovenous fistula bypasses than the control grafts at all time intervals: 71% vs. 57% at 3 months, 48% vs. 25% at 6 months, and 40% vs. 22% at 12 months, respectively. This is the first controlled study that provides experimental evidence suggesting that these bypasses may produce increased patency of prosthetic arterial grafts and lends support to their use in a clinical, prospective, randomized study.\r"

Seven patients, who had had eight grafts died in hospital. The remaining 202 grafts fell into three groups: (1) Sixty grafts in patients who received 325 mg of dipyridamole and 1.0 g of acetylsalicylic acid daily, starting on the second postoperative day and continuing for six months. (2) One hundred and two grafts in patients on no antithrombotic therapy. (3) Forty grafts in patients on warfarin therapy to maintain the prothrombin time (prothrombin-proconvertin method) within the therapeutic range (0.10 to 0.20). Medication was continued for six months. This group included more high-risk patients than the other two groups. The mean ages and the incidence of risk factors did not vary significantly between the groups. The patency rates in three groups at five years were 62.5%, 44.0% and 26.0% and at ten years 48.5%, 25.0% and 21.5% for the dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid, no therapy and warfarin groups, respectively. The limb salvage rates were 100%, 96% and 85% in the dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid, no therapy and warfarin groups respectively. Thus, the best results were seen in the aspirin/dipyridamole group.\r"

Over the last 7 years 24 PTA procedures were performed on 37 vein graft stenoses in 19 grafts. Graft stenoses were diagnosed from 2 to 72 (mean = 17.3) months after implantation. PTA was successfully completed in 23 (96%) of the 24 procedures including 18 (95%) of the primary, and 5 (100%) of the secondary procedures. Recurrent vein graft stenosis or graft thrombosis developed in 12 (67%) grafts from 3 to 47 (mean = 12.5) months after primary PTA. Long-term patency after primary PTA was 69% at 6, 29% at 12, and 22% at 36 months; secondary patency was 81% at 6, 45% at 12, and 27% at 36 months. During the same period vein graft stenosis in 7 fem-pop and 2 fem-tib grafts were surgically revised with an initial success rate of 100%, and 2 (22%) complications. Four (44%) of these grafts occluded from 1-17 (mean 6.2) months after repair, yielding a primary 5-year patency of 62%. Although vein graft stenosis may be safely, effectively, and repeatedly treated with PTA, long-term durability appears to be superior after surgical revision.\r"

Correction of these defects, while grafts are still patent, potentially improves overall graft patency. In this study we compared color flow and conventional duplex to determine whether color flow provided additional information not obtainable by conventional duplex examination. The primary patency rate (patency maintained without intervention) for all 51 cases was 76% (39/51). The secondary patency rate (patency maintained by identification and correction of graft defects before failure) was 88% (45/51). Duplex scanning reduced the graft failure rate by 50%. Color flow and conventional duplex examination provided the same information regarding incipient graft failure. In 20 patients monitored with both techniques, the same number of proximal (100%) and distal (90%) anastomoses were imaged. The same number of graft defects (three vein graft stenoses, one proximal femoral artery stenosis) were identified. Velocity data obtained using the two techniques (peak systolic velocity in an area of stenosis and the duplex velocity ratio) were not always the same, making calculation of percent stenosis from this data inaccurate. Color flow duplex is useful in monitoring graft patency, but provides no additional information over that provided by conventional scanning.\r"

The pathology was similar for all three cases with lipid laden macrophages, loss of elastic lamina, and other atherosclerotic changes in the vein wall. While atheromatous changes and aneurysm formation in saphenous vein bypass grafts are rare, this may occur especially in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia.

One-hundred sixty-three patients with primary varicose veins (144 females, 19 males; 96 unilateral, 67 bilateral) in 230 involved limbs were examined. The origin and extent of venous reflux was traced with Doppler ultrasound. Three distinct groups were recognized. Group I. Typical saphenous varicosities with junctional escapes occurred in 164 (71.3%). Sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ) incompetence in 147, and sapheno-popliteal junction (SPJ) incompetence in 17 limbs. Group II. Atypical saphenous varicosities with non-junctional escapes occurred in 51 (22.17%) limbs. In 5 limbs, no escape was detected. Twenty-two limbs had escapes localized in the main perforators: mid-thigh perforator 17, upper calf 2, distal ankle in 3. Twenty-four limbs had their escapes in the auxiliary perforators: abdomino-pelvic 17, and circumflex iliac/external epigastric, 7 limbs. Group III. Non saphenous (lateral venous system) varicosities occurred in 15 (6.52%) limbs. Based on physical examination alone, 55 limbs would possibly have undergone unnecessary ankle to groin stripping and 83 limbs an unnecessary SFJ ligation. Doppler US is an essential diagnostic tool that can accurately map the origin and extent of the venous reflux. The obtained hemodynamic information will permit more selective, multimodal therapy and avoid the indiscriminate, often unnecessary stripping of the entire saphenous system in all cases of primary varicose veins.\r"

Five of these patients were pregnant women who were treated for deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities. The women were either in their second or third trimester of pregnancy. The clinical diagnosis in each case was confirmed with duplex ultrasonography. Each patient was treated with 7 to 10 days of intravenous heparin therapy and then discharged on subcutaneous heparin therapy. There were no bleeding complications related to the heparin therapy. No patient developed a pulmonary embolism. Each patient delivered a normal child. The only complication was a heparin induced rash in one patient which resolved when a different preparation of heparin was used. The management of deep venous thrombosis in pregnancy is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsatile GnRH therapy has yet to achieve widespread acceptance as an alternative to exogenous gonadotropin therapy in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea and complete GnRH deficiency. However, when a physiologically based replacement regimen of pulsatile GnRH is used, a high rate of ovulation and conception can be anticipated in patients with complete GnRH deficiency and hypothalamic amenorrhea. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome may also benefit from pulsatile GnRH, although rates of ovulation are lower. Pretreatment with a GnRH agonist may improve these rates considerably, but experience is limited. Whether an iv or sc route of administration is chosen, a simplified clinical monitoring protocol can be created which requires a minimum of patient monitoring while assuring maximum safety. Seventy five nanograms per kg appears to be a reasonable initiating dose, with subsequent increases in those who do not respond. The frequency of GnRH administration is best based on the GnRH pulse frequency in normal women. However, further information is needed to determine whether such a variable frequency is clearly superior to a fixed frequency regimen. When used appropriately, pulsatile GnRH is safe, effective, and offers an excellent alternative to conventional gonadotropin therapy for women with disordered endogenous GnRH secretion. Most importantly, and as opposed to exogenous gonadotropin therapy, pulsatile GnRH can be administered by most physicians in the office setting without the necessity of on-line E2 monitoring. This feature will enable more patients to receive treatment by their local physicians, whereas exogenous gonadotropin therapy should be administered by appropriately equipped referral centers. In the future, further studies will be required to determine which other categories of patients might benefit from pulsatile GnRH.\r"

Integrated estrogen exposure over the pubertal years was obtained by a score based on physiological events known to reflect circulation estrogen levels. The subjects were selected to provide great variation in estrogen exposure. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by single photon absorptiometry (midradius) and dual photon absorptiometry (spine and first metatarsal of the foot). Weight, estrogen score, and testosterone levels were highly correlated with BMD of the spine, wrist, and foot (P less than 0.05). Age correlated positively only with the BMD of the wrist. Twenty-four girls reaching ages 18-20 yr in the 2 yr of observation were divided into groups reflecting low (less than 24), medium (25-48), and high (greater than or equal to 49) estrogen exposure. The lowest scoring groups had the lowest spine and wrist BMD (P less than 0.05). This group weighed less and had lower weight to height ratio (P less than 0.05), the lowest weight (P less than 0.05) during adolescence, the highest age of menarche, and the highest amount of fiber in the diet (P less than 0.05). These subjects were separated into low and high BMD groups. Those subjects with the lowest values for spine, wrist, and foot were found to have significantly lower estrogen exposure scores and lower weight/height ratios; in addition, low BMD of the foot was associated with higher activity levels. Thus, wrist and spine BMD are affected by estrogen exposure during adolescence and weight; foot BMD, in addition, was negatively affected by activity, suggesting that bone mass in the active adolescent is affected by the absence of estrogen exposure.\r"

Gel chromatography and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography indicate that the majority of the substance-P immunoreactivity in human pituitaries elutes as authentic substance-P and its oxidized derivative. Immunohistochemical studies showed substance-P-immunoreactive fibers and terminals in the posterior pituitary gland and occasional substance-P-immunoreactive cell bodies in the anterior lobe. The substance-P-immunoreactive cells were found to colocalize with a small subpopulation of TSH beta-immunoreactive cells (thyrotrophs). Substance-P immunoreactivity was also found in a pituitary microadenoma that contained numerous TSH beta-immunoreactive cells.

Immunoreactive TNF alpha (I-TNF) was observed in granulosa cells of healthy antral and atretic follicles and appeared to be secreted by the granulosa cells, since it was present in the follicular fluid surrounding antral and degenerating granulosa. Preantral follicles did not exhibit I-TNF. I-TNF was in the cytoplasm of large granulosa-lutein cells and small paraluteal cells. Granulosa cells cultured on an Immobilon membrane exhibited I-TNF in the cytoplasm and I-TNF released onto the membrane, which appeared as a dark-red stain after immunolocalization. Granulosa cells cultured on plastic slides exhibited I-TNF throughout the cytoplasm. To determine if I-TNF was secreted by granulosa cells, granulosa cell-conditioned medium was examined for the presence of TNF by a double sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay using both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to human recombinant TNF alpha. Conditioned medium contained up to 800 pg TNF/500,000 cells after 24 h of culture. I-TNF was also found (100-170 pg/mL) in human follicular fluid. Immunoblot assay of I-TNF in cultured granulosa revealed approximately 240 pg TNF/250,000 cells. The results indicate that the human ovary contains I-TNF, and thus, a paracrine and/or autocrine role of TNF in human ovarian follicular function seems likely.\r"

To characterize the distribution of PLP in human endocrine tissues and tumors, we localized PLP in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique with polyclonal antisera. Among peptide hormone-producing tissues, PLP was identified in nontumorous adenohypophysis and pituitary adenomas; medullary thyroid carcinomas; normal, hyperplastic, and adenomatous parathyroids; adrenal medulla and pheochromocytomas; normal pancreatic islets; and endocrine tumors of pancreas, gut, and lung, including small cell carcinomas. In other endocrine tissues PLP was identified in nontumorous thyroid follicular epithelium, colloid nodules, and follicular neoplasms; normal adrenal cortex, adrenocortical adenomas, and carcinomas; nontumorous testicular Leydig cells; normal ovarian granulosa and thecal cells; an ovarian thecoma and a granulosa cell tumor; placental trophoblast; and decidua. These results demonstrate that PLP is localized in many normal and neoplastic endocrine cells, including those not known to influence extracellular calcium homeostasis. The presence of PLP in a variety of endocrine tissues suggests that it may play a local physiological role in the growth or function of endocrine cells.\r"

[125I]Cyanopinodolol, nonlabeled adrenergic agents, and BAR1/BAR2 cRNA were used as probes. The relationship between binding sites for BAR1 and BAR2 was markedly different from that between the basal mRNA expression for the two receptor subtypes. Plasma membranes as well as a microsomel-enriched fraction contained binding sites only for BAR2. The potency of BAR agonists and antagonists in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity of plasma membranes was typical of a BAR2 response. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA isolated from liver tissue showed hybridization of the BAR1 probe to a mRNA species of 2.5-2.6 kilobases and of the BAR2 probe to a mRNA species of 2.2-2.3 kilobases. The basal level of BAR1 mRNA was 5-fold higher than of BAR2 mRNA, as assayed by solution hybridization. No difference in BAR subtype mRNA stability was observed, as indicated by a mRNA half-life of approximately 5.5 h for both receptor subtypes. It is concluded that specific factors are involved in the steady state regulation of BAR subtype expression in human liver. This tissue contains solely BAR2 owing to a posttranscriptional block of basal BAR1 expression.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare the reproducibility of two approaches to the evaluation of GH secretion: the integrated concentration of GH (IC-GH), a physiological test of GH secretion, and pharmacological stimulation tests. IC-GH was determined in 40 poorly growing children twice within 4 weeks. The first and second IC-GH were highly correlated r = 0.859, P less than 0.001. One hundred and thirteen poorly growing children underwent pharmacological GH stimulation tests twice within 6 weeks. A moderate correlation was found between the first and second pharmacological test r = 0.524, P less than 0.01. Among the three pharmacological stimuli studied, clonidine (n = 81) had the highest reproducibility followed by arginine (n = 20), and insulin (n = 12). We conclude that IC-GH is more consistently reproducible than the GH response to repeated pharmacological stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Hashimoto's thyroiditis has been shown to be associated with the HLA-specificities DR4 and DR5. Since former association studies yielded variable results, we used novel molecular typing methods to assess predisposing immunogenetic factors. Gene analysis of the HLA-DR-DQ and tumor necrosis factor region was performed in a group of Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients and randomly chosen controls using standards and nomenclature of the 10th International Histocompatibility Workshop. Genomic DNA of patients and controls was analyzed using a cDNA probe of the DQB1 gene. The resulting restriction fragment patterns allowed the determination of newly defined DQw-types 1-9. We find the strongest relative risk conferred by DQw7 (RR = 4.7), that is observed in 36 of 64 patients (56%) and only 21 of 98 controls (21%) (P corr less than 0.002). Comparison of DNA sequence variation in the DQB1 gene, that is found predominantly in Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients, indicates that codons 45 and 57 are critical features in DQw7 which distinguish it from other DQw specificities. The adjacent DQA1 genes also display a significant association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (DQA1*0201/*0301 heterozygotes were found in 37% of patients and 15% controls, P less than 0.03). No significant association could be found with polymorphisms of the tumor necrosis factor gene. These results provide a new basis for the concept of genetic susceptibility in Hashimoto's thyroiditis and will help to elucidate the underlying autoimmune mechanisms that lead to disease at the functional level.\r"

  ".W": "In order to test the hypothesis of a role of thyroid hormones on the circulating levels of sex steroid binding protein (SHBG) in children, SHBG levels were determined in 15 infants with congenital hypothyroidism at diagnosis and during the first 18 months of T4 therapy and in a separate group of 13 children with congenital hypothyroidism (7.1 +/- 0.5 yr, mean +/- SD), treated before 1 month of age, both during adequate L-T4 therapy and 4 weeks after withdrawing therapy. SHBG levels were significantly lower in hypothyroid infants than in controls (48.2 +/- 6.5 vs. 77.8 +/- 7.9 nmol/L; P less than 0.01), and significantly lower in infants with athyreosis compared to those with ectopic or eutopic glands (P less than 0.05). In patients with low values at diagnosis, SHBG increased rapidly and remained normal during LT4 therapy. After 1.5-18 months of treatment, a positive correlation (P less than 0.01) was found between SHBG, FT4, and FT3 levels. In older hypothyroid children, 4 weeks after withdrawal of therapy a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in SHBG concentrations was observed. Analysis of these results as well as previous reports in adults, indicates that thyroid hormones influence SHBG concentrations in infants and children. This study also indicates that thyroid hormones may play a role in the physiological postnatal increase of SHBG.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism is characterized by unusual sensitivity of aldosterone secretion to ACTH. Suppressibility by glucocorticoid and continued stimulability by exogenous ACTH has provided the basis for diagnosis and treatment of the disorder. A qualitative biochemical abnormality consisting of marked overproduction of the products of the cortisol C-18 oxidation pathway, 18-hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol, has been examined in 10 patients with the disorder and compared to the normal C-18 oxidation products of corticosterone, aldosterone, and 18-hydroxycorticosterone. The technique, based on stable isotope dilution mass fragmentography, measured the tetrahydro urinary metabolites of aldosterone, 18-hydroxycorticosterone, and 18-oxocortisol and unmetabolized 18-hydroxycortisol. All 4 C-18 oxygenated corticosteroids were markedly elevated in the untreated state and showed rapid parallel suppression with low doses of glucocorticoid. The proportional changes in C-18 oxygenated cortisols together with aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone suggested the mechanism of a common catalytic site of a cytochrome P450 methyl oxidase serving both cortisol and corticosterone substrates. The ACTH-dependent secretion of the C-18 oxidation products of both corticosterone and cortisol in the disorder is attributed to the acquisition of methyl oxidase activity by the fasciculata zone, where there are abundant pools of these precursors.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with primary affective disorders, such as melancholic depression and anorexia nervosa, frequently have a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, characterized by hypersecretion of CRH and a blunted ACTH response to exogenous CRH. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a luteal phase dysphoric disorder characterized by primarily affective and behavioral disturbances. HPA axis function was compared in PMS patients and control women, respectively, diagnosed by DSM3-R criteria or found to have no current psychiatric disorders, determined by the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime Interview. Urinary free cortisol excretion was the same in PMS and normal women, and no differences in urinary free cortisol excretion between the follicular and luteal phases occurred in either group. Two HPA axis abnormalities, however, were noted when PMS patients were compared to normal women. First, basal evening cortisol concentrations in plasma were significantly decreased, while the time-integrated response of plasma cortisol to ovine (o) CRH was significantly increased. Second, the negative correlation between time-integrated plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH and basal luteal progesterone concentrations present in normal control women was not seen in the PMS patients. These changes in basal and oCRH-stimulated plasma cortisol levels in association with normal urinary free cortisol excretion suggest that women with PMS might have transient or episodic disturbances of their HPA axis, which appear adequately corrected by this system's servomechanisms. This probably explains the maintenance of regular menstrual cycles in PMS patients, which contrasts with the irregular menses observed in patients with depression, anorexia nervosa, or women who participate in chronic strenuous exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Pheochromocytomas, neural crest tumors, express an abundance of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II). To assess further the potential for IGF-II to play an autocrine role for these tumors, we measured 1) IGF-II content by RRA in 7 pheochromocytomas and peripheral blood in these patients, 2) IGF-II receptors by Western analysis, and 3) characterized the tumor binding proteins by ligand blot studies. IGF-II levels in the tumors varied from 2.8-41 micrograms/g. Chromatography revealed that 60% of the peptide eluted as a large mol wt form of IGF-II (8.7-10 kDa); the remainder coeluted with mature peptide (7.5 kDa). This was in contrast to IGF-II levels in normal adrenal tissue (0.225 +/- 0.005 micrograms/g) or another neural crest-derived tumor, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (0.63 +/- 0.02 micrograms/g). Serum IGF-II levels in the 7 patients with pheochromocytoma (720 +/- 71 ng/mL) were similar to those in 35 normal controls (762 +/- 69 ng/mL). Radiolabeled IGF-II (9 +/- 1%) and IGF-I (20 +/- 2%) bound specifically to pheochromocytoma membranes. Western analysis of these membranes using a specific antiserum directed against the type II receptor demonstrated a band at 210 kDa. Affinity cross-linking studies with [125I]IGF-I demonstrated a specific band at 140 kDa. Ligand blot analysis was performed on the void volume pools from the Sephadex G-75 column and demonstrated bands at about 30 and 25 kDa. In conclusion, these data 1) confirm that pheochromocytomas have increased levels of IGF-II; 2) demonstrate that despite high IGF-II concentrations in the tumors, peripheral levels are not elevated, suggesting that very little tumoral IGF-II is released into the circulation, unlike catecholamines; 3) demonstrate the presence of IGF-II and IGF-I receptors; 4) describe binding protein species similar to those present in other tissues. Thus, the presence of high levels of IGF-II and both type I and type II receptors suggests that IGF II may act through both receptors to alter tumor growth.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently demonstrated the production of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) as well as the presence of type I IGF receptors in human thyroid cells in primary culture. The role of IGF-I in the control of thyroid cell growth has been well established. In order to investigate the involvement of IGF-I in abnormal thyroid growth, the density of IGF-I receptors in solitary, cold, micro- and macro-follicular thyroid adenomas, and in extranodular histological normal tissue was studied. Forty-three euthyroid patients with isolated cold nodules were selected for the study. In 30 patients the presence of IGF-I receptors was evaluated by using quantitative immunohistochemistry; in 10 patients by using radioligand binding studies, and in 3 patients by using affinity labeling. Cross-linking and binding studies clearly demonstrated the presence of a homogeneous class of binding sites for type I IGF receptors. Furthermore, radioligand studies did not show any significant differences in receptor density between the 2 types of thyroidal tissues. Conversely, the computerized analysis of 900 fields of nodular and normal thyroid tissues immunostained with the monoclonal antibody alpha-IR3, strongly indicated that higher concentrations of IGF-I receptors were present in the epithelial cells of non-functioning thyroid nodules than in the adjacent extranodular thyroid tissues. These studies strongly suggest that the same type I IGF receptor is present in thyroid follicular adenomas as in histological normal thyroid tissue removed from the same patient. The higher concentration of IGF-I receptors as documented by immunostaining in the adenomas suggests that IGF-I may contribute to the abnormal growth of the neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "The serum concentrations of a specific GH-binding protein, derived from the GH receptor, were assayed in sera from 62 African pygmies and 101 normal statured controls. Samples were assayed in the absence and presence of excess GH using 2 separatory procedures. Interassay variability for samples was corrected by a standard reference pool of sera from adults assayed with all unknown samples. Results were expressed as specific binding relative to this standard. The mean percent relative specific binding for GH increased with age in normal-statured controls throughout childhood and adolescence. Relative specific binding for GH was 37.0 +/- 2.0% (mean +/- SEM) in control subjects between the ages of 1-5 yr (mean age, 2.9 yr) and increased progressively to 93.0 +/- 7.0% in young adults (mean age, 23 yr). The relative specific binding of GH by serum from pygmies did not exceed 30.1 +/- 3.4% of the control adult standard at any age period (P less than 0.001), and there was no progressive age-related increase in binding. The decrease from normal binding was minimal in pygmies during childhood (29%), but the decrease from normal was 60-70% in adolescents and adults. Thus, short stature in pygmies probably results not from an absolute deficiency of GH receptors per se, as in Laron dwarfism, but from a failure of cellular GH receptors to increase in a normal manner. This is most compatible with a change in regulating expression of the GH receptor gene, rather than a structural defect in the coding sequence of the GH receptor gene.\r"

However, no double blind, placebo-controlled study has substantiated these findings. We present the results of a randomized double blind 14-day clinical trial with octreotide in 20 patients with acromegaly. The drug was given sc every 8 h and to the initial dose (50 micrograms) was added another 50 micrograms every other day up to 200 micrograms. GH levels, calculated as the mean values of 12 observations at hourly intervals during 0700-1800 h, and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels were significantly reduced during octreotide treatment. Responses varied from a reduction of 97% of the basal mean GH level to no significant reduction in 2 of 10 patients. There was a good correlation between the reduction of GH and IGF-I levels. The main side-effects were gastrointestinal and well tolerated. We found a spontaneous variation of daily mean GH and IGF-I levels (at 0700 h) in the placebo group, ranging from approximately 150% to 50% of the GH and 120% to 80% of the IGF-I levels noted on day 0. In patients treated with octreotide, the occurrence of GH rises between administration times suggests that it may be desirable to give octreotide every 6 h in some patients.\r"

  ".W": "Bilateral, selective, and simultaneous catheterization of the inferior petrosal sinus is not only a valuable tool in the differential diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, but may also provide new insights into paracrine interactions at the pituitary level. We have investigated whether CRH (1 microgram/kg BW) has any effect on the release of PRL, GH, TSH, or the alpha-subunit of hCG during this procedure. Sixteen patients under evaluation for Cushing's syndrome (Cushing's disease, n = 12; ectopic ACTH syndrome, n = 2; glucocorticoid resistance, n = 1; hormonally inactive adenoma, n = 1) were catheterized. Two of the patients with Cushing's disease received 4.0 mg naloxone iv 15 min before stimulation with CRH. Patients with Cushing's disease demonstrated a central/peripheral gradient and an intersinus gradient not only for ACTH, but also for PRL, alpha-subunit, GH, and TSH, provided that the latter two hormones were not completely suppressed by the glucocorticoid excess. Moreover, all hormones increased in response to CRH on the side with the highest ACTH concentration; PRL rose from 31.2 +/- 6.4 to 61.6 +/- 12.4 micrograms/L (P less than 0.01), and alpha-subunit from 2.6 +/- 0.6 to 6.4 +/- 1.7 micrograms/L, (P less than 0.01). Naloxone was unable to abolish the PRL or alpha-subunit increase in response to CRH. A multihormonal response to CRH in inferior petrosal sinus blood was also observed in the patient with glucocorticoid resistance and in the patient with the hormonally inactive tumor, but not in the patients with ectopic ACTH secretion. The multihormonal response to CRH could be explained by cosecretion of other hormones together with ACTH from corticotroph adenoma, by an effect of CRH on pituitary blood flow, or by a paracrine action of pituitary corticotrophs on adjacent normal pituitary cells. Our results do not support the concept that such a paracrine action is mediated by beta-endorphin. However, a higher dose of naloxone may be required to antagonize the action of pituitary beta-endorphin.\r"

Plasma (200 microL) was incubated with [125I]human (h) GH (200,000 cpm) at 4 C for 20 h. The main GH-BP (peak II) was well separated from free [125I]hGH (peak III) and from a higher mol wt complex (peak I), which was minor. In our control plasma, the specific binding of [125I]hGH to peak II BP (II-BP) was 32.2 +/- 0.6% of the radioactivity. Scatchard analyses indicate an association constant of 3.6-7.4 X 10(8) M-1 and a binding capacity ranging from 24-86 ng/mL for peak II-BP in five normal adult plasma samples. Peak I material, separated from plasma of boys with pubertal delay, bound hGH with a low affinity (3 x 10(6) M-1) and a very high capacity (2 micrograms/mL). In cross-linking experiments, peak I appeared as two proteins of 165 and 174 kD; these mol wt were much higher than that of peak II-BP, previously estimated at 53,000. hGH complexed to peak II-BP remained fully immunoreactive with use of the anti-hGH antibodies of our assay. In plasma containing 10-20 micrograms/L hGH, the proportion of bound hormone (peak II) was 44.5 +/- 2.3%, whereas the amount of hGH in peak I was very low or undetectable. Specific binding of hGH to II-BP was lowest during the first year of life and highest in adulthood. No sex difference was found. I-BP is differentially regulated, since its binding activity was significantly lower in adults than in prepubertal children. Normal values for age should be taken into account to interpret GH-binding activity, particularly in children 2 yr of age or younger. Our GH binding assay offers important gains in terms of rapidity and resolution; it has permitted a clear separation and characterization of the two GH-binding components present in human plasma.\r"

Therefore, specific receptors for these hormones were determined in different regions of human adipose tissue using ligand techniques, with separation of bound and free hormone by chromatography, absorption techniques, or isoelectric focusing, as well as protein quantitation with monoclonal antibodies against human estrogen and progesterone receptors. Furthermore, mRNAs were measured by solubilization hybridization technique with glucocorticoid, estrogen, and progesterone receptor cRNA probes for human receptors. Saturable specific cytosolic glucocorticoid binding was found. Quantitative analyses indicated more binding sites and mRNAs in intraabdominal than sc adipose tissue samples. In contrast, neither specific estrogen or progesterone binding, cytosolic or nuclear receptor protein, nor mRNAs for these receptors could be identified in abdominal, femoral, or omental adipose tissues. Parallel control experiments confirmed the presence of both estrogen and progesterone receptors in rat adipose tissues. It was concluded that while glucocorticoid receptors are clearly present in human adipose tissues, female sex hormone receptors are not present in quantities detectable with presently available methods. Effects of these hormones on human adipose tissue might, therefore, be mediated via a minute nondetectable quantity of receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor, or indirect mechanisms.\r"

In spite of this, in the diabetic patients lactate (5.1 +/- 0.8 mumol L-1 min-1) and alanine (2.6 +/- 0.4) release by the forearm was 3- and 2-fold higher than in the control group (lactate: 1.7 +/- 0.8, P less than 0.005; and alanine: 1.3 +/- 0.2, P less than 0.05, respectively). The ratio of lactate release to glucose uptake was 57% and 18% in diabetic and control subjects, respectively. Insulin administration did not affect either glucose uptake or the release of gluconeogenic substrates by the forearm. It is concluded that: 1) in fasting patients with NIDDM, glucose is taken up by the skeletal muscle in normal amounts but preferentially used nonoxidatively with lactate formation. This suggests that, although the muscle does not contribute directly to fasting hyperglycemia, it may play an indirect role through an increased delivery of glucose precursors; and 2) insulin-induced normoglycemia is maintained by mechanisms that do not involve the exchange of glucose and gluconeogenic substrates by the skeletal muscle.\r"

Transplants were frozen to -80 C immediately after removal to avoid diffusion of inorganic iodide. Autoradiographic assessment of over 1000 cryosections (exposed either at -20 C or after thawing and washing out unbound iodide) showed two types of cold follicles, namely those that failed to accumulate iodide and, therefore, did not organify iodine, and those that readily accumulated iodide but failed to bind it, suggesting a failure of apical membrane peroxidase. The two types of pathogenetically different cold follicles coexisted in an apparently randomly intermingled fashion throughout the whole goiter.\r"

The 2 groups were matched for age, sex, clinical problems, use of medications, and nutritional status. Patients with detectable serum TNF levels had significantly lower serum T3 concentrations compared to those with undetectable levels [1.072 +/- 0.588 vs. 1.621 +/- 0.594 nmol/L (mean +/- SD); P less than 0.01].

Thyroid function tests were not significantly different when patients with detectable interleukin-1 alpha levels, another cytokine secreted during endotoxemia, were compared to those with undetectable levels.

Basal [Ca2+]i levels were 146 and 153 nM in the absence and presence of 1 mM extracellular Ca, respectively. In Ca-containing medium, both PGF2 alpha and oxytocin significantly (P less than 0.01) increased [Ca2+]i over control values, eliciting half-maximal stimulation (ED50) at 4 and 1 nM, respectively. In Ca-free medium the potency of PGF2 alpha to raise [Ca2+]i was drastically reduced (ED50, 2 microM), whereas that of oxytocin remained the same, although maximal responses were markedly decreased. PGF2 alpha had no effect on total IP production in the concentration range that significantly raised [Ca2+]i. However, at a 100 times higher concentration (10 microM), PGF2 alpha produced a maximum 48% increase in total IP, with a rapid (15-30 s) rise in IP3 and IP2, followed by IP1. A similar increase in IP production was obtained when [Ca2+]i levels were raised by A23187 to the same level as that obtained with 10-50 microM PGF2 alpha. The effect of PGF2 alpha was dependent on extracellular Ca and could be suppressed by verapamil, but not by pertussis toxin, or phorbol ester. In contrast, the potencies of oxytocin to raise IP and [Ca2+]i were similar and independent of extracellular Ca2+, and could be suppressed by pertussis toxin and phorbol ester, but not by verapamil. These data provide evidence that in isolated human myometrial cells, PGF2 alpha and oxytocin trigger an increase in [Ca2+]i by different mechanisms. The action of PGF2 alpha depends on extracellular Ca2+, whereas oxytocin activates the G-protein-dependent phospholipase-C-IP3-Ca2+ signal-transducing pathway, complemented by the influx of extracellular Ca2+.\r"

Eight healthy men were given placebo and DHEA (1600 mg/day) for 4 weeks each in a double blind cross-over study. DHEA treatment caused a 9-fold increase in mean plasma DHEA sulfate concentrations, but had no significant effect on body weight or on two indices of lean body mass (total body water and total body potassium). DHEA had no effect on any of the parameters of energy and protein metabolism, including resting metabolic rate, total energy expenditure (estimated by the 2H2(18)O method during the final 2 weeks of each treatment period), leucine flux (an index of whole body proteolysis), the nonoxidized portion of leucine flux (an index of whole body protein synthesis), and the rate of incorporation of leucine into muscle protein. Circulating levels of cholesterol, T3, and T4 also were unaffected by DHEA. These data suggest that DHEA is not an important regulator of energy or protein metabolism in humans.\r"

Its function in regard to the delivery of its ligands and in other respects is unclear. The binding of [125I] TTR to cultured human astrocytoma cells was studied to determine whether these cells carry receptors for TTR. Scatchard analysis was consistent with a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 3 nM. No significant cross-reactivity with transferrin or serum albumin was observed. Internalization of TTR was temperature dependent and proportional to receptor occupancy. Dilutions of cerebrospinal fluid displaced [125I]TTR in proportion to their content of radioimmunoassayable TTR and in parallel with purified TTR. The uptake and internalization of TTR increased in the presence of high T4 or T3 concentrations. These results demonstrate that TTR binds to specific high affinity receptors on human astrocytoma cells. Receptor binding of TTR provides a potential mechanism for the delivery of its ligands within the central nervous system.\r"

Our aim was to determine whether plasma vasopressin and oxytocin levels were altered in healthy volunteers who did or did not develop nausea during vection, an optokinetic stimulus which produces the illusion of self-motion. Vection was produced by rotating a drum with an inner surface of black and white vertical stripes around the seated stationary subject. Gastric myoelectrical activity was recorded continuously throughout the experiment with electrodes positioned on the abdominal surface. Plasma samples were obtained before vection and after drum rotation stopped when nausea and tachygastria were present. Vasopressin and oxytocin were extracted from plasma and quantified by RIA. During vection six subjects reported nausea and developed gastric dysrhythmias; six other subjects had no nausea and remained in normal 3-cpm myoelectrical rhythms. Vasopressin and oxytocin values before vection were similar in each group of subjects. One minute after vection stopped, plasma vasopressin levels were significantly greater (P less than 0.05) in subjects experiencing nausea and tachygastrias (35.4 +/- 26.7 pmol/L) than in those without symptoms (2.7 +/- 0.47 pmol/L). Oxytocin levels were unchanged by either vection or nausea. It is concluded that 1) vasopressin, not oxytocin, neurons in the magnocellular-neurohypophyseal system are activated during vection-induced nausea and gastric dysrhythmias; and 2) illusory self-motion may be used safely to study the neuroendocrine responses to brain-gut interactions and nausea in man.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies in the rat and rhesus monkey have disclosed apparently high frequency in vivo ACTH release episodes. While the circadian pattern of plasma ACTH concentrations has been known for many years, the exact frequency of ultradian pulsatile ACTH release in man is not clear, due in part to variable intensities of blood-sampling schedules and the limited availability of sensitive ACTH assays. In this study we used a new sensitive and specific immunoradiometric assay to measure plasma ACTH concentrations in blood sampled at 1) 2-min intervals for 3 h, followed by 4-min intervals for 4 more h in six men; and 2) 10-min intervals for 24 h in eight other men. An objective peak detection algorithm (Cluster) and cosinor analyses were used to assess the episodic pulsatility and circadian rhythmicity of ACTH. Comparisons were made among the 2 min (3 h), 4, 8, and 12 min (7 h), and 10 min (24 h) time series. Mean ACTH interpulse intervals were significantly different among the five sampling groups (P less than 0.00001). Sampling every 2 min yielded a mean ACTH interpulse interval of 18 min, which was significantly shorter than the mean interpulse intervals of 35, 53, 52, and 73 min resulting, respectively, from sampling every 4, 8, 10, and 12 min (P less than 0.05). In contrast, maximal peak ACTH amplitudes (picomoles per L or percent increase) did not vary as a function of sampling frequency. The 24-h plasma ACTH concentration time series showed significant diurnal variation, with a mean circadian amplitude of 0.95 +/- 0.15 pmol/L occurring at 1008 h (+/- 25 min). Cosinor analysis of various ACTH pulse parameters deduced from the 24-h time series revealed significant circadian rhythmicity in the ACTH peak maxima (P less than 0.05), peak increments (P less than 0.05), and prepeak nadir (P less than 0.05) concentrations, but not in ACTH interpulse intervals. We conclude that in men, 1) intensive sampling at 2-min intervals unmasks high frequency ACTH release episodes that cannot be detected at conventional sampling rates; and 2) ACTH peak amplitude, but not frequency, varies significantly during the course of circadian changes in the plasma ACTH concentrations.\r"

After baseline studies in the fasting state, the effect of a calcium infusion on PTH levels was studied. Estrogen replacement resulted in a fall in fasting resting ionized calcium and a rise in PTH levels. After calcium infusion there was no change in the shape of the relationship between plasma calcium and PTH. The level of nonsuppressible PTH secretion was not altered. Transdermal estrogen did not alter basal vitamin D-binding protein levels, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, or calcitriol levels. We conclude that the effect of transdermal estrogen replacement on PTH secretion is completely explained by the lowering of ionized calcium, causing a rise in PTH secretion. Thus, with this route of estrogen replacement, there is no necessity to postulate a direct effect of 17 beta-estradiol on the parathyroid gland.\r"

  ".W": "Estrogen treatment improves calcium malabsorption induced by surgical or natural menopause, but the mechanisms involved are still under debate, with both increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] and improved peripheral responsiveness to the steroid having been proposed. To address this issue, we studied the effect of short term administration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (1 microgram/day for 7 days) on intestinal fractional absorption of 47Ca (47Ca FA) and vertebral bone density, measured by dual photon absorptiometry, in 14 premenopausal women (aged 31-50 yr) before and 6 months after oophorectomy. After surgery, patients were randomly allocated to a 6-month treatment with either conjugated estrogens (0.625 mg/day; n = 7) or placebo (n = 7). Oophorectomy caused a decrease in both basal 47Ca FA (-40.8 +/- 23.4%; P = 0.004) and vertebral bone density (-7.21 +/- 1.20%; P less than 0.001) in the placebo group. Estrogen replacement prevented these changes and increased basal serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 (+10.3 +/- 10.9%; P = 0.047), whereas a detectable but not significant decrease was observed in the control group (-8.8 +/- 10.5%; P = 0.07). Assessment of 47Ca FA before and after 1,25-(OH)2D3 administration revealed a similar degree of responsiveness to the steroid in the estrogen-treated women before and at the end of the study period (45.8 +/- 6.9% vs. 42.9% +/- 14.9% from basal, respectively; P = 0.142), but a blunted response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 was observed in the placebo group at 6 months (27.9 +/- 17.7%) compared to the result obtained before surgery (36.7 +/- 9.1%; P = 0.032). Multifactor analysis of variance revealed that the effects of estrogen and 1,25-(OH)2D3 on 47Ca FA were independent of basal serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 levels. On the other hand, calcitriol administration increased serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 to a similar extent before and 6 months after surgery in the placebo group (24.2 +/- 18.3% vs. 34.7 +/- 16.7% from basal, respectively; P = 0.484) as well as in the estrogen-treated women (34.2 +/- 17.2% vs. 26.6 +/- 15.45%; P = 0.302). The significant impairment of 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation of 47Ca FA in spite of increased levels of circulating 1,25-(OH)2D3 in the untreated women is suggestive of an end-organ resistance to the vitamin D metabolite in a hypoestrogenic condition, which can be prevented by hormone replacement, and supports the hypothesis of a vitamin D-independent action of estrogen on intestinal calcium absorption.\r"

  ".U": "91035836\r", 
  ".W": "It has been proposed that central obesity, by virtue of the enhanced lipolytic activity of abdominal adipose tissue, leads to higher plasma FFA concentrations, which, in turn, decrease both hepatic removal of insulin and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by peripheral tissues. In short, the predicted consequences of abdominal obesity are elevations in circulating FFA and insulin levels as well as insulin resistance. The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationships predicted by the overall hypothesis; this study was carried out in 31 obese females, defined as having normal glucose tolerance (n = 12), impaired glucose tolerance (n = 8), or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (n = 11). Abdominal obesity was estimated by determining the ratio of waist to hip girth, fasting and postprandial plasma FFA and insulin concentrations were measured at hourly intervals from 0800-1600 h, and insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was quantified by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. The first step in the postulated sequence of events to be tested was that the greater the WHR, the higher the total integrated plasma FFA response. The correlation coefficient between these two variables was 0.29, indicating that the results did not support the prediction. Furthermore, we could not demonstrate any relationship between the magnitude of the plasma FFA and insulin responses (r = 0.20; P = NS). However, there was a modest inverse relationship between height of circulating plasma insulin concentration and a decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (r = -0.43; P less than 0.03) in the group as a whole. On the other hand, when the three groups were analyzed individually, a significant inverse relationship was only seen in the control group (r = -0.67), and a direct relationship was actually seen in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (r = 0.88). Furthermore, when the mean responses for the variables in each of the three groups were compared, it was apparent that the postulated relationships between abdominal obesity, plasma FFA concentration, and insulin secretion and action were not present. Thus, the data presented do not support the hypothesis that differences in the degree of central obesity play an important role in regulation of plasma concentrations of either FFA or insulin or in modulation of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the patients we studied.\r"

PHPT may be associated with low circulating 1,25-(OH)2D levels. Furthermore, low 1,25-(OH)2D levels in PHPT may be due to a direct effect of severe hypercalcemia and be reversible with correction of hypercalcemia.\r"

In the present study diabetic rosettes were detected in some subjects at risk for type 1 diabetes (first degree relatives of type 1 diabetic patients or nondiabetic subjects with previous transient hyperglycaemia). The mean number of lymphocytes adherent to beta-cells (beta-CL) was significantly higher in subjects at risk for type 1 diabetes than in age- and sex-matched control blood bank donors (P less than 10(-6]. This number of beta-CL was higher in type 1 diabetic patients than in subjects at risk (P less than 10(-6], and one-way analysis of variance by rank (Kruskal-Wallis) revealed that the three populations (controls, diabetics, and risk subjects) were different in terms of beta-CL values (P less than 0.001). The percentage of subjects at risk that had a positive test (arbitrarily defined as a beta-CL value higher than the 95th percentile of 228 controls) was 20%. No difference was observed between the two subgroups of subjects at risk in terms of either mean +/- SEM of beta-CL or percentages of individuals with a positive test. These diabetic rosettes were slightly associated with acute insulin response to iv glucose lower than the 5th percentile of controls (immunoreactive insulin at 1 +/- 3 min, 250 pmol/L; by chi 2, P = 0.04) and with HLA DR 3/4 heterozygosity (by chi 2, P = 0.04). They were not associated with islet cell antibodies (regardless of the threshold for positivity, expressed in Juvenile Diabetes Foundation units), insulin autoantibodies, activated (HLA DR+) T-lymphocytes, or sex. A statistical association was detected between HLA DR 3/4 heterozygosity and a low acute insulin response to iv glucose (by chi 2, P less than 0.003). The preliminary (2-yr) longitudinal follow-up revealed that out of five islet cell antibody-positive subjects who progressed to type 1 diabetes, three displayed beta-CL values higher than the 90th percentile of controls. Diabetic rosettes could, thus, be detected in some individuals at risk for type 1 diabetes as a marker of cell-mediated immunity.\r"

The cross-reactivity of immunopurified human LH in the CG assay was less than 0.03%. LH was also measured by a double monoclonal immunoradiometric assay. Secretion of CG by the cultured fetal pituitary cells was readily detectable, although in gradually decreasing amounts, for the 11 days of culture. LH secretion paralleled CG secretion and was much greater in magnitude. Pituitary cells from female fetuses generally secreted more CG as well as more LH than those from male fetuses. Dilutions of the medium showed that the secreted CG exhibited parallelism with the CG standard. Chromatofocusing of the medium across a pH 6-9 gradient yielded several peaks of LH immunoreactivity between pH 6.5 and 8.5, but no peaks of CG. Chromatofocusing of the medium across a pH 3-7 gradient yielded peaks of CG, but not LH, between pH 4.0-5.5. These data indicate that CG immunoreactivity, distinct and separable from LH immunoreactivity, is secreted by the dispersed cells of fetal human pituitary glands.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, we reported a direct effect of androgens on murine and human bone cells to stimulate bone cell proliferation and differentiation. To test whether this effect of androgenic steroids might be mediated by growth factors, we measured relative concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I and -II (IGF-I and IGF-II) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) in the conditioned medium from androgen-treated murine calvarial cell cultures. Only the concentration of TGF beta was increased. Consistent with the increased secretion of TGF beta in the mouse calvarial cell system, we observed an increased expression of TGF beta mRNA in a normal human osteoblastic cell system. We also determined whether androgens alter the response to growth factors. We found that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment enhanced the mitogenic effects of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and IGF-II but not those of IGF-I. The enhanced effect of FGF and IGF-II after DHT pretreatment was not affected by addition of TGF beta-blocking antibodies or by changing the culture medium. This indicated that in addition to increased release of TGF beta, another mechanism might be involved in the action of DHT on human and murine bone cells. Thus, we investigated the binding of human IGF-II to human osteoblastic cells and observed an increase in IGF-II binding after DHT treatment. Our results are consistent with a mechanism of action of androgens on bone cells that involves the induction of TGF beta and, in addition, may sensitize the cells to show an enhanced response to FGF and IGF-II, possibly by changing the receptor binding of mitogenic growth factors.\r"

IGFBP-1 was also present in FF, and an IGFBP with a mol wt of 24000 daltons, present in serum, appeared to be absent in FF. Identification of IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 was confirmed using IGFBP-specific antisera. IGF-I and IGF-II levels were measured in patient serum and FF at the time of oocyte harvest, and serum levels of both peptides were consistently higher than FF levels. The finding of three major serum IGFBPs in human FF suggests that IGF regulation in the ovary is probably under complex control by this set of regulatory BPs.\r"

  ".U": "91035842\r", 
  ".W": "The 20,000-dalton variant of human GH (20K) is known to circulate in blood, but few details are known about its plasma transport. A substantial portion of 20K appears to be protein bound despite its low affinity for the receptor-related GH-binding protein (BP). We, therefore, investigated the binding pattern of 20K in human plasma. Radioiodinated 20K was incubated with plasma or plasma fractions, and the mixture was fractionated by gel filtration. Saturation/Scatchard analysis was performed with both 20K and 22,000-dalton GH (22K). The majority (approximately 80%) of protein-bound 20K was complexed with a low affinity BP (Ka = approximately 2 x 10(5) M-1), with the remainder complexed with the high affinity2 receptor-related BP. The binding of 20K to the low affinity BP was specific for 20K; it may involve a 20K-specific binding site on the previously described low affinity plasma BP (peak I) or a separate 20K-specific BP. 22K did not interact with this binding site/BP. Analysis of the 20K-BP complex by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing suggested, but did not prove, the existence of a separate BP for 20K. We conclude that 20K in plasma binds primarily to a low affinity, 20K-specific binding site (possibly a new, third GH-BP), with only a small fraction bound to the GH receptor-related BP. This binding pattern is markedly different from that of 22K, which is predominantly bound to the receptor-related BP. The existence of a 20K-specific binding site/BP suggests an as yet unrecognized role for this GH variant.\r"

At birth, serum testosterone in boys was higher than for girls, increased dramatically during the first 3 h after birth, and remained elevated (2 to 3 times higher than for girls) between 3 and 12 h after birth. In newborn human males, a sudden discharge of hypophyseal LH appears to stimulate neonatal secretion of testosterone by the testes. The functional significance of this phenomenon remains to be determined.\r"

Patients received ascending doses, ranging from 0.3-8 mg fadrozole twice daily, each for a period of 2 weeks. Drug kinetics and endocrine effects were evaluated specifically for the 2- and 8-mg twice daily treatment regimens. The in vivo activity of the drug was demonstrated by the suppression of estrone and estradiol biosynthesis from testosterone and androstenedione, respectively. The drug inhibitory constant, KI, for the estrone synthetic pathway, was 3.0 ng/mL (13.4 nmol/L) and was of similar magnitude as that determined under in vitro conditions. The KI for the estradiol synthetic pathway was 5.3 ng/mL (23.7 nmol/L). The disparity between KI values may indicate that the two pathways are not equivalent in terms of their inhibition by fadrozole. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrated tha the drug was rapidly absorbed after oral dosing, with peak plasma concentrations achieved in median times of 1 and 2 h, respectively, for the 2- and 8-mg twice daily treatment regimens. The average half-life and oral clearance values were 10.5 h and 621 mL/min, respectively. Oral clearance was independent of dose.\r"

Data were analyzed using the pulse detection program Pulsar and time series analysis, and are presented with respect to age and puberty stage. Mean and maximum GH concentrations, sum of the peak amplitudes, and mean calculated baseline concentrations in the normal children were higher during puberty; highest levels were seen in girls at puberty stages 2-3, and in boys at stages 4-5. A similar pattern was observed in the diabetic adolescents, but all measures of pulse height and mean calculated baseline concentrations were significantly greater than those in the normal subjects (multivariate analysis, P less than 0.001). Pulse frequency did not change during puberty in the normal or diabetic subjects, and the dominant pulse periodicity in both groups was about 180 min. We conclude that the predominant change in GH release during puberty is in pulse amplitude, and that this is increased in diabetes, whereas pulse frequency remains constant in both normal and diabetic adolescents.\r"

We have studied the effect of CRH on GHRH-induced GH release in man. In the first study, CRH was injected iv at three different doses (100, 50, or 25 micrograms) at 0800 h together with 50 micrograms GHRH in six men and six women. In a second study, 100 micrograms CRH were given iv at 0800 h, 1 h before the administration of 50 micrograms GHRH in five men and five women. Each subject demonstrated a normal GH response after the administration of 50 micrograms GHRH plus saline. All doses of CRH administered simultaneously with GHRH significantly inhibited GHRH-induced GH release in women [peak value +/- SE after GHRH plus saline, 28.9 +/- 2.9 micrograms/L; after GHRH plus 100 micrograms CRH, 9.9 +/- 0.7 micrograms/L (P less than 0.001); after GHRH plus 50 micrograms CRH, 8.7 +/- 0.8 micrograms/L (P less than 0.001); after GHRH plus 25 microgram CRH, 9.5 +/- 1.6 microgram/L (P less than 0.001]). In contrast, in men, while a dose of 100 micrograms CRH was capable of suppressing GHRH-induced GH secretion (peak value +/- SE, 8.1 +/- 0.6 vs. 20 +/- 2.9 micrograms/L; P less than 0.001), no inhibition was observed after 50- and 25-micrograms doses. When 100 micrograms CRH were injected 1 h before the administration of 50 micrograms GHRH, it strongly inhibited GHRH-induced GH secretion in both men (peak value +/- SE, 6.2 +/- 2.8 vs. 24.6 +/- 5.9 micrograms/L; P less than 0.02) and women (peak value +/- SE, 14.2 +/- 4.5 vs. 37.8 +/- 6.7 micrograms/L; P less than 0.005), and this inhibition lasted up to 2 h post-CRH administration. These results demonstrate that CRH is capable of inhibiting GHRH-induced GH release in both men and women. Furthermore, the findings suggest that a sexual dimorphism in the neuroregulation of GH secretion may be present in man. In view of the inhibitory action of CRH on GH secretion, simultaneous administration of CRH and GHRH for testing should be avoided in clinical practice.\r"

The concentrations were compared to those of total estradiol and total progesterone, and correlated to oocyte cleavage and the establishment of pregnancies. Serum concentrations of CBP were significantly higher in women who became pregnant (1469 +/- 108) nM (+/- SEM] than in those who did not (CBP, 1200 +/- 58 nM; P less than or equal to 0.05). The concentrations of SHBG were not significant different in these two groups of women (72.4 +/- 9.3 and 60.8 +/- 4.2 nM, respectively; P greater than or equal to 0.10). By contrast, in FF significantly higher concentrations of both SHBG and CBP were found in women achieving pregnancy (SHBG, 56.1 +/- 2.8 nM; CBP, 1198 +/- 37 nM) than in those who did not (SHBG, 45.5 +/- 1.4 nM; P less than or equal to 0.001; CBP, 1079 +/- 29 nM; P less than or equal to 0.01). A positive correlation was found between serum and FF levels of both SHBG (r = 0.85; P less than or equal to 0.001) and CBP (r = 0.70; P less than or equal to 0.001). FF levels of estradiol and progesterone did not differ regardless of whether the oocyte cleaved. However, a significant reduction of estradiol was found in fluid from follicles in which the oocyte cleaved and resulted in pregnancy (3046 +/- 180 nM) than in fluid from follicles in which the oocyte cleaved but without establishment of pregnancy (4162 +/- 282 nM; P less than or equal to 0.001). There was no correlation between estradiol and SHBG and between progesterone and CBP. However, levels of FF progesterone above 15,000 nM combined with CBP concentrations above the mean concentration found in FF (1,127 nM) were related with oocyte cleavage in 87% of the cases. The overall cleavage rate is 56%. The higher levels of SHBG and CBP in serum compared to those in FF, and the positive relationship between serum and FF levels suggest that both proteins arise from the circulation. The similar levels in serum and FF indicate that neither SHBG nor CBP is responsible for maintaining the concentration gradient of estradiol and progesterone from follicle to plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

No relationship was apparent in either group between TBII or TSBAb activity and any clinical or laboratory parameter examined. Moreover, no clinical or laboratory findings distinguished patients with TRAb from those without. The low prevalence of TRAb in primary hypothyroidism suggests that intrathyroidal cell-mediated destructive mechanisms may be more important in the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism in autoimmune thyroiditis.\r"

In agreement with published reports, only minute amounts of beta-core fragment were detected (less than 0.1% of hCG level). A small amount of beta-core fragment activity was identified near the void volume of the column (Mr greater than 60,000). This high molecular weight material was pooled and dissociated with 3M ammonium thiocyanate, and gel filtration repeated. A much more significant beta-core fragment peak was then detected (Mr = 15,000). After dissociation, beta-core fragment was 18% (mol/mol) of the hCG level in early pregnancy serum, 91% in mid-pregnancy serum, 50% in term pregnancy serum, but only 1.3% in choriocarcinoma serum, pre-therapy. We conclude that the major form of beta-core fragment found in serum is associated with other macromolecules, which mask the beta-core fragment epitope to existing hCG beta antibodies. Measurements made on the dissociated beta-core fragment complex are much more in keeping with pregnancy levels found in urine.\r"

Whereas the clinical riddle enshrouding the HHM syndrome first posed in the early 1940s appears to have been largely solved, a whole new field, concerning the physiological role(s) of PTHRP has opened. The field has evolved rapidly and provides an example of fruitful clinical investigation: the original problem was a clinical one (the HHM syndrome); understanding the clinical disorder led to pursuit of the problem in the laboratory (adenylate cyclase assays, protein purification, molecular cloning, PTHRP synthesis); and observations made in the laboratory have rapidly yielded clinical fruits (PTHRP immunoassays) and opened a new window on normal physiology.\r"

  ".W": "As the pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas remains unclear, the tumor clonal composition of these common neoplasms was studied. Clonality was determined in female patients by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the X-chromosome genes hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase and phosphoglycerate kinase in conjunction with their respective methylation patterns. Peripheral lymphocyte DNA was screened from 62 female patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma. Eleven patients were heterozygous for the BglI site on PGK, 4 for the BamHI site on HPRT, and 1 patient for both sites. Of these 16 patients, 3 had acromegaly, 4 had Cushing's disease, 7 had hyperprolactinemia, and 2 were clinically nonfunctional. After surgery, morphological study, including immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of the pathological specimens, allowed a direct comparison between clonality and tumor cell type. Control fresh normal pituitary tissue was found to be polyclonal. The following tumors were monoclonal: all 3 somatotroph adenomas, 4 of 4 lactotroph tumors, 3 of 4 corticotroph cell adenomas, a gonadotroph adenoma, and a nonsecretory adenoma. A mixed plurihormonal adenoma was polyclonal, as were 2 tumors consisting of adenomatous lactotrophs interspersed with nontumorous adenohypophyseal pituitary tissue and one corticotroph adenoma mixed with normal pituitary tissue. Functional pituitary adenomas derived from somatotrophs, corticotrophs, or lactotrophs and nonsecretory tumors are monoclonal in nature, suggesting that somatic cell mutations precede clonal expansion of these cells and play a major role in pituitary tumorigenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Although the administration of estrogens and androgens can affect the concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in men, the relationships between endogenous estrogens and androgens and SHBG are uncertain. Therefore, in a randomly selected cohort of 1640 middle-aged men we measured androgen, estrogen, and SHBG concentrations and obtained the subjects' weight, ethanol intake, and smoking histories. The data were analyzed by stepwise multiple regression, with SHBG as the dependent variable, to compare the role of hormones with that of other factors in the control of SHBG levels. Neither estrone or estradiol nor the testosterone/estradiol ratio was predictive of SHBG levels. However, SHBG concentrations were positively correlated with total testosterone and negatively correlated with percent free and percent albumin-bound testosterone. SHBG concentrations were negatively correlated with estrone sulfate, but were positively correlated with the testosterone/estrone sulfate ratio and the concentrations of free and albumin-bound testosterone. In addition, in all models tested age and body mass index (wt/ht2), but not smoking or ethanol, were strong predictors of SHBG concentrations. Thus, when present in physiological amounts in the blood as a result of glandular secretion, there is a positive relationship between SHBG concentrations and testosterone and, to a lesser extent, free- and albumin-bound testosterone, but age and body mass index appear to be more important in predicting the SHBG concentration.\r"

The peak insulin response to the oral glucose load was progressively delayed with each of the 3 glucose tolerance categories. A similar finding was observed with the peak C-peptide response to oral glucose, except for the absence of distinction between IGT and NIDDM. Variables measuring the initial rate of insulin or C-peptide secretion (0-30 min) after oral glucose also demonstrated a progressive diminution with increasing glucose intolerance. The relative incremental insulin response at 30 min and the relative incremental C-peptide response at 30 min were highly correlated with the fasting glucose levels (r = -0.61 and r = -0.62; P less than 0.0001, respectively). Variables measuring the 0-30 min secretory response had high variances, whereas the variance for fasting glucose was low. Twelve men who were initially classified as IGT subsequently developed NIDDM. These 12 men had significantly higher fasting glucose levels at baseline than the remaining men who did not develop diabetes, but the 30 min secretory parameters after oral glucose, although lower in those who subsequently developed diabetes, were not significantly different at baseline. However, if fasting glucose is used as a surrogate measure of secretory response, these 12 men appear to have had an impairment of oral glucose-stimulated insulin secretion antedating the development of NIDDM. The inability of the secretory parameters to detect the abnormality may be due to a type II statistical error, which may be resolved by a larger sample size.\r"

Posture is the major determinant for plasma aldosterone and PRA levels, but it is not known whether postural increments (delta) of plasma aldosterone and (delta) PRA are also abnormal in LRH. To evaluate this, LRH (n = 8), normal renin hypertensives (NRH; n = 9), normotensive controls (n = 18), and subjects with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA; n = 5) were studied in a metabolic unit on a controlled diet over 7 days. Overnight supine and 4-h upright PRA, plasma aldosterone, and 24-h urinary tetrahydroaldosterone (THA) and aldosterone secretion rates (ASR) were measured. The delta in plasma aldosterone after 4 h of upright posture was not different in the four groups. The ratio of delta plasma aldosterone/delta PRA, however, was elevated in both IHA and LRH compared to that in NRH and normals. THA excretion was also elevated in IHA and LRH, but LRH had a normal ASR. This resulted in a higher fractional THA excretion (THA/ASR) in LRH compared to the other three groups. These data further support enhanced adrenal angiotensin-II sensitivity in LRH. Aldosterone was preferentially metabolized to THA in LRH. Since THA has reduced biological activity, this may be a compensatory mechanism to reduce mineralocorticoid activity in LRH.\r"

  ".W": "Six girls (7-13 yr old) with Turner's syndrome and short stature were treated for 1 yr with recombinant human GH (0.15 U/kg.day, sc) and had sequential determinations of serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), osteocalcin, and procollagen-III. Bone mineral content and density of the spine and radius were measured before treatment and at 90 and 360 days. Two girls received small doses of ethinyl estradiol (0.025 micrograms/kg) in addition to GH. Height velocity increased by 144% after 3 months of treatment. IGF-I was normal (0.75 +/- 0.20 kU/L) before treatment and increased by 90% on day 1 and by 290% on day 360. Procollagen-III was low before treatment; it peaked at 53.0 +/- 14.7 micrograms/L (260% above baseline) on day 30, then decreased to the normal range. Serum osteocalcin increased more slowly to reach a plateau on day 90 of 23.7 +/- 1.2 micrograms/L (46% above baseline). Before treatment, bone mineral content of the spine was 25% lower than that of children matched for bone age. Bone mineral contents of the peripheral and axial skeleton were increased by 10% and 17%, respectively, after 1 yr of treatment, an increase commensurate with that of bone age in the four patients who did not receive estrogen. On day 90, however, although radius mineral density was already increased by 3%, the mineral density of the lumbar spine was significantly decreased by 4%. We conclude that treatment with GH increases IGF-I, collagen turnover, osteoblastic function, and height velocity in Turner's syndrome. However, there is no catch-up of bone mineral content after 1 yr of treatment, and an early effect of GH is to decrease spine mineral density.\r"

To examine the independent influence of physical activity on IGF-I relative to other lifestyle variables, we also determined fat-free weight, percent body fat, body fat distribution (waist to hip and waist to thigh ratios), and habitual caloric intake in our population. IGF-I was 33% lower (P less than 0.01) in older men than in younger men, inversely related to percent body fat (r = -0.55) and indices of upper body fat distribution (waist to hip ratio, r = -0.45; waist to thigh ratio, r = -0.47), and positively related to VO2 max (r = 0.64) and leisure time physical activity (r = 0.45; P less than 0.01). IGF-I was not related to fat-free weight or daily caloric intake. After controlling for the effects of age by multiple regression analysis, VO2 max (r = 0.29) and leisure time physical activity (r = 0.24) were the sole factors independently related to IGF-I (P less than 0.05). Our results suggest that multiple factors contribute to the age-related decline in IGF-I. Lower levels of IGF-I in aging men are related at least in part to diminished physical activity.\r"

  ".U": "91035866\r", 
  ".W": "Suppression of immune function was traditionally thought to occur only with pharmacological levels of glucocorticoids. However, recent studies in rodents have suggested that glucocorticoids exert tonic antiinflammatory/immunosuppressive effects even at basal nonstress concentrations. To examine whether basal glucocorticoid secretion modulates immune function in man we employed the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486. If a tonic level of inhibition of the immune system by basal glucocorticoid levels was present, then a potentiation or enhancement of immune function might evolve in the absence of glucocorticoid action. To examine this hypothesis, we studied 11 healthy male normal volunteers who received RU 486 (10 mg/kg.day) or placebo vehicle, divided into 2 daily oral doses, for 7-14 days. Blood samples were collected every 2 days for measurement of plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations along with 24-h urine samples for measurement of 17-hydroxysteroid and free cortisol excretion. Complete and differential blood counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and quantitative immunoglobulins were also determined at 2-day intervals. Leukocytes were obtained by leukopheresis for phenotypic characterization and functional analysis before and 7 days after the initiation of RU 486 or placebo therapy. Blockade of cortisol receptors with RU 486 was associated with marked compensatory elevations of plasma ACTH and cortisol and increases in 24-h urinary excretion of 17-hydroxysteroids and free cortisol. Unexpectedly, 8 of the 11 subjects developed generalized exanthem after 9 days of RU 486 treatment. One subject developed symptoms and signs consistent with the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Total white blood cell counts, absolute lymphocyte, neutrophil and eosinophil counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and quantitative immunoglobulins did not change with RU 486 therapy. Similarly, T-, B-, and natural killer cell subsets did not change during RU 486 treatment. Furthermore, functional evaluation of lymphocyte cytotoxicity and proliferation revealed no changes. We conclude that administration of high doses of RU 486 to normal volunteers does not result in measurable enhancement of immune function. This suggests that in man, glucocorticoids may not exert a tonic inhibitory effect on the immune system as they appear to do in rodents. Alternatively, the compensatory increase in endogenous cortisol may obviate any effect of the glucocorticoid antagonist on the immune system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "At present, the mechanism(s) underlying the reduced spontaneous and stimulated GH secretion in aging is still unclear. To obtain new information on this mechanism(s), the GH responses to both single and combined administration of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH; 1 microgram/kg iv) and arginine (ARG; 30 g infused over 30 min), a well known GH secretagogue probably acting via inhibition of hypothalamic somatostatin release, were studied in seven elderly normal subjects and seven young healthy subjects. Basal GH levels were similar in both groups, while insulin-like growth factor-I levels were lower in elderly subjects (76.7 +/- 9.2 vs. 258.3 +/- 29.2 micrograms/L; P = 0.01). In aged subjects GHRH induced a GH increase (area under the curve, 314.9 +/- 91.9 micrograms/L.h) which was lower (P = 0.01) than that in young subjects (709.1 +/- 114.4 micrograms/L.h). On the other hand, the ARG-induced GH increase in the elderly was not significantly different from that in young subjects (372.8 +/- 81.8 vs. 470.6 +/- 126.5 micrograms/L.h). ARG potentiated GH responsiveness to GHRH in both elderly (1787.1 +/- 226.0 micrograms/L.h; P = 0.0001 vs. GHRH alone) and young subjects (2113.0 +/- 444.3 micrograms/L.h; P = 0.001 vs. GHRH alone). The potentiating effect of ARG on the GHRH-induced GH response was greater in elderly than in young subjects (1013.0 +/- 553.5% vs. 237.9 +/- 79.1%; P = 0.0001); thus, the GH increase induced by combined administration of ARG and GHRH overlapped in two groups. In conclusion, these results show that, differently from the GHRH-induced GH increase, the somatotroph response to combined administration of ARG and GHRH does not vary with age. Our finding suggests that an increased somatostatinergic activity may underlie the reduced GH secretion in normal aging.\r"

All subjects received either 120 mg oral PD or placebo 60 min before iv injection of either human GHRH-(1-29) NH2 (100 micrograms) or sterile water (2 mL). In normal subjects both PD alone and GHRH alone caused a significant increase in GH. PD and GHRH acted in a synergistic fashion when combined. In diabetic patients the GH response to GHRH was variable. To segregate the responses, the ratio between the GH increase after GHRH plus PD and after GHRH alone was calculated for each subject. In 10 diabetic patients (group A) the ratio was lower than 2 SD (P less than 0.05) from the mean response of normal subjects. These patients showed an exaggerated GH increase after GHRH and a lower GH increase after PD with respect to normal subjects. Eight diabetic patients (group B) showed a ratio similar to that in normal subjects and similar GH responses to the stimuli. No significant differences were found between groups A and B with respect to age, body mass index, and blood glucose levels. Duration of diabetes was longer and basal GH levels were higher in group A. Hemoglobin-A1c was higher in group A, but of only borderline statistical significance (P = 0.052). Our data demonstrate that in diabetic patients with exaggerated GH responses to GHRH an increase in cholinergic tone does not affect GH secretion. These data suggest that in some type 1 diabetic patients an altered somatostatinergic control of GH secretion may contribute to their abnormal GH response to GHRH.\r"

Immunohistochemistry using antihuman B-cell antibody (L26) was also performed. Sections were scored for both lymphocytic infiltrates and fibrosis [none (0), small (1), moderate (2), or large (3)]. Blinded scoring was performed. A moderate to severe UCHL1 infiltrate was present in 9 of 44 (20%) IDDM, compared with 1 of 29 (3%) control subjects (P less than 0.04).

Seventeen of 44 (39%) IDDM subjects had either a moderate to large cellular infiltrate or moderate to severe adrenal medullary fibrosis compared with 2 of 29 (7%) control subjects (P = 0.003). Staining of the adrenal medulla with L26 revealed a large cellular infiltrate in only one subject who was UCHL1 negative.

Total 24-h urinary hGH excretion in each patient examined for 2 consecutive days varied from 1 day to the next. There were no differences in urinary hGH excretions between the NSC group and the NC group. The lower values for daily urinary hGH excretion in the NSC group overlapped some of the higher values in the PGHD group. However, when the mean urinary hGH level of both days was used, the 24-h urinary hGH excretion clearly separated the PGHD (5.5 +/- 2.3 ng/day; range, 1.3-9.2; n = 21) and CGHD (1.9 +/- 0.9 ng/day; range, 0.6-3.6; n = 14) groups from the NSC (12.8 +/- 3.1 ng/day; range, 9.3-17.5; n = 10) and NC (14.6 +/- 3.1 ng/day; range, 10.6-19.0; n = 6) groups without any overlap. A mean urinary hGH value less than 9.0 ng/day during a 2-day collection strongly suggested GH deficiency. Ten of 16 patients with PGHD and CGHD who received 2 IU met-hGH, sc, had urinary hGH levels within the range of the mean +/- SD in NSC. These patients received daily sc 0.097 +/- 0.024 IU/kg hGH injections. These results suggest that the measurement of 24-h urinary hGH excretion is noninvasive, accurate, and useful for the screening of GH deficiency. The mean value on 2 days of 24-h urinary hGH excretion for the screening of GH deficiency is estimated to be less than 9.0 ng/day. The optimal dose of GH as therapy for GH deficiency is demonstrated as daily sc injection of 0.1 IU/kg hGH, 0.7 IU/kg/week. To convert international units of met-hGH to milligrams, divide by 2.4.\r"

The serum GH response to iv administration of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) was also studied in the groups under tether and vest restraint. Serum samples were collected every 15 min and assayed for GH using a human GH RIA and for cortisol using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. GH and cortisol concentrations in the young and older groups were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the chaired studies the older animals had a lower mean 6-h basal GH concentration than did the younger animals (2.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 3.5 +/- 0.5 micrograms/L; P = 0.0002). Prestimulation GH was lower before clonidine and insulin in the older chaired group (1.1 +/- 0.5 and 2.3 +/- 0.6 micrograms/L, respectively) compared to the younger group (3.6 +/- 0.8 and 3.8 +/- 0.7 micrograms/L, respectively; P less than 0.001).

In the present study we determined whether use of exogenous insulin could permit minimal model assessment of insulin sensitivity (SI) to be extended to diabetic subjects. Normal volunteers had separate FSIGT assessments supplemented with both tolbutamide and insulin to accelerate glucose disappearance, while diabetics had a FSIGT supplemented only with insulin. There was a strong and highly significant correlation between the two assessments in normal subjects (r = 0.87; P less than 0.001), and the rank order of SI generally was maintained with the two assessments over a 3-fold range of SI; however, insulin-determined SI was 16% lower (3.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 4.1 +/- 0.4 x 10(-4) min/microU.microL; P less than 0.01). Diabetic subjects had markedly lower insulin sensitivity than controls (SI = 0.61 +/- 0.16; P less than 0.0001). Across all subjects, the level of fasting serum glucose was correlated inversely with both insulin sensitivity (r = -0.62; P less than 0.05) and acute insulin responses (r = -0.72; P less than 0.02); however, insulin sensitivity in diabetic subjects with little insulin secretion (0.6 +/- 0.2) was comparable to insulin sensitivity in diabetic subjects with near-normal responses (0.6 +/- 0.3). In subjects with fasting hyperglycemia, there were significant correlations between insulin sensitivity and body mass index, percent fat mass, and waist/hip ratio (all P less than 0.03). Among all female subjects, there was also a strong correlation between insulin sensitivity and upper body obesity, as measured by waist/hip ratio (r = -0.68; P less than 0.02). Model parameters also permitted glucose uptake to be estimated in diabetic vs. normal subjects at comparable hyperglycemia (11.1 mmol/L). Total glucose uptake was decreased in diabetic subjects (5.2 +/- 0.8 vs. 12.7 +/- 1.7 mg/min.kg in normals; P less than 0.001), insulin-dependent glucose uptake was diminished to a greater extent (1.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 6.2 +/- 1.2) than noninsulin-independent glucose uptake (3.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 6.4 +/- 0.9; both P less than 0.02). Administration of insulin permits minimal model FSIGT analysis to be applied to diabetic as well as normal subjects, yielding information about both insulin- and noninsulin-mediated glucose uptake as well as insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.\r"

To assess the effects on GH secretion of a new potent D2-dopamine agonist, the octahydrobenzo(g)quinoline CV 205-502 (CV) we have investigated the GH responses in healthy male volunteers to four different iv doses. For this purpose 3 separate groups of 9 subjects were studied. The respective groups were administered on separate occasions 10 micrograms CV and placebo (group 1), 5 micrograms, 2.5 micrograms, and placebo (group 2), and 1 microgram and placebo (group 3). Each subject received drug and placebo in a double blind randomly assigned order, with at least 5 days between their administration. Active compound or placebo was infused over 30 min, and blood sampling was carried out for 72 h after cessation of infusion. Peak GH levels occurred between 45-60 min after the end of the infusion; the observed maximum GH concentrations were 19.2 +/- 2.9 micrograms/L (10 micrograms, iv; P less than 0.001 vs. placebo), 9.61 +/- 2.1 (5 micrograms, iv; P less than 0.001 vs. placebo), 4.7 +/- 1.7 (2.5 micrograms, iv; P less than 0.05 vs. placebo), and 1.9 +/- 0.8 micrograms/L (1 micrograms, iv; P = NS vs. placebo). The mean integrated GH secretion expressed in arbitrary units [area under the response curve (AUC)] up to 3 h postinfusion showed a typical dose-response relationship. Mean values were 1715 +/- 269.4 (10 micrograms, iv; P less than 0.001 vs. placebo), 956.1 +/- 189.9 (5 micrograms, iv; P less than 0.001 vs. placebo), 312.8 +/- 105.8 (2.5 micrograms, iv), and 162.8 +/- 47.5 (1 microgram, iv). In a second study with a separate group of 18 volunteers, we compared the GH response to an oral dose of 100 micrograms CV with those to 5 micrograms CV given iv and placebo treatment. Peak GH values in this study were 20.3 +/- 5.5 micrograms/L (100 micrograms, orally; P less than 0.01 vs. placebo) and 14.6 +/- 2.8 (5 micrograms, iv; P less than 0.001 vs. placebo).

  ".W": "Two populations of oxytocin-staining neurons have been identified in the paraventricular nucleus: magnocellular neurons that terminate in the posterior pituitary and parvocellular neurons that terminate elsewhere in the central nervous system. Whether these oxytocin neurons are functionally separate was tested by measuring oxytocin concentrations in samples of peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained simultaneously from lactating rhesus monkeys during suckling. Lactating animals bearing temporary subarachnoid and venous catheters were maintained in a constant photoperiod (0600-1800 h). Samples of CSF were continuously withdrawn by peristaltic pump (0.1 mL/15 min) for 2-4 consecutive days from subarachnoid catheters with the tips placed at the T12-L1 level of the spinal column in four lactating monkeys 4 months postpartum and again after weaning. On 2 of these days, we observed and recorded periods of infant suckling and collected peripheral blood samples (1.2 mL) from the mother at 5-min intervals for 60 min. Oxytocin was measured in blood and CSF by RIA. Oxytocin concentrations increased in the plasma of the lactating monkeys during periods of nursing, with peak concentrations ranging from 4-16.7 microU/mL. No increase in plasma oxytocin was found on the day after the infant was weaned. Variations in the concentrations of oxytocin in CSF were independent of the suckling stimulus and plasma oxytocin concentrations and occurred during observed periods of no nipple contact by the infant and at the time of weaning after the infant had been removed from the mother. Each lactating animal also displayed a normal circadian variation in CSF oxytocin concentrations, with peak and nadir levels during light and dark hours, respectively. We conclude that release of oxytocin into the CSF of lactating monkeys is disassociated from release into the peripheral circulation. The data further support the conclusion that neuronal pathways giving rise to oxytocin in the CSF and the periphery are anatomically and functionally separate in primates.\r"

Both patients were clinically stable and normonatremic, with no signs or symptoms of respiratory distress, when the studies were performed. However, both exhibited evidence of hemodynamic instability in the sitting posture. Linear regression analysis of the plasma vasopressin/plasma osmolality (Pavp:Posm) relationship during infusions of 0.85 M sodium chloride showed no significant differences in either the slope (sensitivity) or abscissal intercept (osmotic threshold) of this relationship compared to that of other quadriplegic subjects when the patients were supine. In contrast, when the patients were studied in the sitting posture there was a marked shift in the relationship of Pavp:Posm indicative of increased sensitivity and reduced osmotic threshold for vasopressin release. The slopes of the Pavp:Posm relationships were 0.249 and 0.178 for the two patients, respectively, compared to 0.092 +/- 0.03 ( +/- SD) for previously studied quadriplegic subjects. Oral water-loading studies performed on one patient revealed marked impairment of urine-diluting ability and free water clearance in the sitting posture compared with observations in similar studies performed when the patient was supine. Impairment of renal water excretion could not be attributed to an effect of vasopressin, which was reduced to unquantifiable levels by water loading. These studies have shown that hemodynamic stress related to autonomic dysfunction in quadriplegic patients may result in marked alteration of osmoregulation of vasopressin release in more severely affected individuals. Such altered osmoregulation, which may also be associated with vasopressin-independent impairment of renal water excretion in the sitting posture, may be a predisposing factor in the development of hyponatremia, especially in the presence of other potent nonosmotic stimuli.\r"

In 10 patients treated for 1 week with finasteride, whole tissue DHT decreased to a mean of 0.302 ng/g. This value was significantly less than DHT values in control patients (mean, 4.5 ng/g) and patients treated with either surgical castration (mean, 1.14 ng/g), megestrol (160 mg/day) plus diethylstilbestrol (0.1 mg), or megestrol plus ketoconazole (1200 mg/day; mean, 0.609). Tissue T levels were significantly increased in finasteride-treated patients (1.18 ng/g) compared to a mean of 0.171 ng/g in controls and 0.105 ng/g in megestrol-treated patients. Part of the prostate tissue obtained at surgery was mechanically separated into epithelium and stroma. The epithelial cells were homogenized, the supernate was assayed for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an androgen-dependent protein, and the pellet was assayed for DHT and DNA. Epithelial cell PSA and DHT values significantly decreased in finasteride- and megestrol- plus estrogen-treated patients compared to controls. However, the slope and position of the regression lines for DHT vs. PSA in patients treated with megestrol plus low dose estrogen (r = 0.79) differed significantly (P less than 0.05) from the regression line relating epithelial DHT to PSA in patients treated with finasteride (r = 0.82). Since the regression slope for finasteride described a greater increase in PSA per unit change in DHT compared to the slope for megestrol plus estrogen, which lowers both DHT and T, finasteride, despite its drastic lowering of DHT, may have a modest residual androgenic effect related to its effect on tissue T.\r"

For each subject there was a striking similarity in the magnitude of secretion of the two hormones and a consistent temporal relationship. Thus, the maximum correlation coefficients of 0.62-0.83 were obtained for the six subjects when the PRL surge lagged that of PTH-(1-84) by 0.5-3.5 h. In contrast, the correlation between PTH-(1-84) and adjusted calcium was weaker (r = -0.36 to -0.66) and showed no consistent temporal relationship (0.0-10.5 h).

  ".W": "Fifty patients with liver cirrhosis (36 alcoholic, 1 drug-induced, 7 posthepatitic, and 6 cryptogenic) and normal renal function were investigated to determine whether PTH levels in serum, measured using the common midregion human PTH-(44-68) RIA, are elevated in such patients and whether this is related to impaired liver function rather than to the effect of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Their data were compared with those from 25 control subjects. The median PTH level of 462 +/- 18 ng/L (+/- SEM) was significantly increased (P less than 0.01) in cirrhotics compared with that of 236 +/- 13 ng/L in the control group. Significant correlations were found between PTH levels and parameters of liver function such as prothrombin time (r = -0.40; P less than 0.01), albumin as a percentage of total protein (r = -0.48; P less than 0.01), bilirubin (r = 0.35; P less than 0.05), albumin (r = -0.34; p less than 0.05), and cholesterol (r = -0.32; P less than 0.05), but not for antipyrine clearance, suggesting increasing PTH with decreasing liver function. The median calcium level (2.26 +/- 0.03 mmol/L), corrected for changes in albumin, was near the lower limit of the normal range (2.25-2.60), but corrected calcium and PTH were positively correlated (r = 0.33; P less than 0.05), indicating that the elevation is not reactive to calcium depletion. A negative correlation existed between PTH and 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol (r = -0.49; P less than 0.05), the main circulating metabolite of vitamin D. Normal values in an immunoradiometric assay that detects the whole sequence of human PTH-(1-84) suggest that fragments rather than the intact hormone are responsible for PTH elevations in cirrhosis. The positive correlation between midregion PTH and corrected calcium is probably an artifact of the correction formula. In conclusion, midregion PTH fragments are increased in patients with liver cirrhosis. The reason for this elevation may well be the impaired liver function rather than secondary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the precise mechanism by which central alpha 2-adrenergic pathways modulate GH secretion in humans. In 10 normal subjects we compared the pattern of clonidine-induced GH release to that elicited by GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) given at a time of presumably similar responsiveness of the somatotrope. We also evaluated the effect of stimulation by GHRH (either endogenous, by administration of clonidine, or exogenous) on the GH response to a further exogenous GHRH stimulation. In 2 experiments the administration of clonidine (0.150 mg, orally) at 0 or 60 min was followed by a GHRH [GRF-(1-29); 1 micrograms/kg, iv] challenge at 180 min. In other experiments subjects received on separate occasions placebo or clonidine at 0 min, followed by GHRH at 60 min and again at 180 min. In a further experiment the administration of clonidine at 0 min was followed by 2 GHRH challenges (60 and 180 min later). The administration of clonidine 60 or 120 min, but not 180 min, before the GHRH bolus significantly (P less than 0.01) increased the GH responses to this challenge compared to those elicited by GHRH when given after placebo in a period of a similar somatotrope responsiveness. These, in turn, were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than those elicited by clonidine alone. The close relationship between pre-GHRH plasma GH values and GHRH-elicited GH peaks, not observed for clonidine, was lost after pretreatment with this drug. These data indicate that clonidine was able to disrupt the intrinsic hypothalamic-somatotroph rhythm, suggesting that alpha 2-adrenergic pathways have a major inhibitory effect on somatostatin release. Our data also indicate that GH responses to a GHRH bolus administered 120 min after a prior GHRH challenge are dependent on two parameters: the intrinsic hypothalamic-somatotroph rhythm at the time of the second GHRH bolus, and the magnitude of GH secretion elicited by the previous somatotroph stimulation. In summary, alpha 2-adrenergic agonism appears to act primarily in GH control by inhibiting the hypothalamic release of somatostatin, rather than by stimulating GHRH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The uptake of [125I]T3 and [125I]T4 by human erythrocytes was studied. The erythrocytes were obtained from adult subjects (28-41 yr old) and suspended in a protein-free medium. The half-times of equilibration for both T3 and T4 were 6 min. At equilibrium, T3 was concentrated 55-fold inside the cells, while T4 was concentrated 40 times, but these accumulations were not dependent on either cellular ATP or the transmembrane Na+ gradient. The amounts of cell-associated thyroid hormones were 20 times (T3) and 17 times (T4) higher than the amounts of free extracellular hormones at 5 X 10(9) erythrocytes/mL (the blood concentration). Oligomycin and phloretin inhibited T3-saturable transport (but not T4 transport) independently of cellular energy. We suggest that thyroid hormones are concentrated by intracellular trapping. The rates of T3 and T4 efflux from preloaded erythrocytes were similar to the influx rates. The initial velocities of T3 (but not T4) uptake and efflux were 70% saturable. The uptake was specific because the unlabeled analogs T4, triiodothyroacetic acid, rT3, D-T3, and D,L-thyronine inhibited [125I]T3 uptake 60, 125, 160, 190, and 1600 times less, respectively, than did unlabeled T3. The kinetic parameters of T3-saturable uptake, Km, and maximum velocity were determined for three groups of subjects: newborns, 28 to 41-yr-old adults, and 76 to 90-yr-old adults. The Km (67 nmol/L in 28 to 41-yr-old adults) was not age dependent, BUT the maximum velocity was significantly higher in newborns than in adults. We conclude that T3 transport across the human erythrocyte membrane is mediated mainly by facilitated diffusion, whereas T4 transport results from free diffusion. Human erythrocytes might act as a circulating pool of thyroid hormones, especially T3 in newborns.\r"

To assess the prevalence and extent of thyroid abnormalities in girls with MAS, we studied 19 patients [mean age, 6.6 +/- 1 (+/- SE) yr; mean bone age, 9.5 +/- 1 yr] and 18 normal control girls (mean age, 10.3 +/- 0.5 yr). All patients appeared euthyroid when examined; 1 was taking antithyroid medication. Ultrasonography revealed thyroid abnormalities in 7 patients, including generalized inhomogeneity, small (2-4 mm) and large (greater than 10 mm) hypoechoic regions, and echogenic nodule-like regions. Repeat ultrasonography after intervals of 9-18 months showed enlargement of large hypoechoic regions in 2 patients. In the patients with abnormal ultrasound findings, serum TSH was uniformly low or suppressed both at baseline and after administration of 7 micrograms/kg TRH. The mean serum T3 level in this group was significantly higher than that in controls (2.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.1 nmol/L; P less than 0.05), whereas mean serum T4, free T4, and T4-binding globulin levels did not differ from those of controls. In the remaining 11 patients, thyroid ultrasonography was normal, and the serum levels of T3, T4, free T4, and TSH were normal. Bioassay showed no detectable thyroid-stimulating activity in the plasma of the MAS patients with suppressed TSH levels. None of the patients became overtly thyrotoxic over 3-6 yr of observation, and their serum iodothyronine levels remained stable. We conclude that thyroid dysfunction is common in girls with MAS, but that it may be clinically occult and not rapidly progressive. The thyroid dysfunction, like that of the ovaries, is associated with structural abnormalities in the gland itself, together with suppressed levels of the respective stimulating hormones.\r"

Glucose utilization in 75 brain areas was determined by analysis of single scans and by least squares estimation of the rate parameters for the FDG model; these data were compared to results in normal caucasian volunteers. No effect of ethnicity or diabetic status on brain glucose utilization was observed. During the hyperinsulinemic clamps (mean insulin, 11,708 +/- 3,026 pmol/L), clearance of 18FDG from blood was accelerated, and accumulation of brain radioactivity was reduced. However, glucose utilization by the brain was identical to results during sham glucose clamps (mean insulin, 204 +/- 56 pmol/L) performed in the same patients. During the studies with hyperinsulinemia, k4 (representing loss of tissue radioactivity) was increased in most brain areas (mean increase, 0.0031 +/- 0.0018 min-1; P less than 0.02). The possible mechanisms for this effect are multiple, and the physiological significance, if any, is unknown. Further studies of the effects of insulin on brain glucose metabolism are needed.\r"

Of the four human endothelin peptides hitherto identified, big endothelin-1 was the major molecular form of endothelin present in human CSF. In addition, there was a small but significant amount of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in CSF, while endothelin-2 was not detectable. Similarly, big endothelin-1, endothelin-1, and endothelin-3 were identified in human plasma. Although big endothelin-1 was the most abundant, a substantial amount of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 was found in plasma with a resultant lower molar ratio of big endothelin-1 to endothelin-1 than in CSF. In all CSF samples from 17 patients requiring diagnostic lumbar puncture or lumbar anesthesia, endothelin was detectable, with a preponderance of big endothelin-1 relative to endothelin-1 and endothelin-3. The mean concentrations of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in simultaneously collected plasma were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than those in CSF, while there was no significant difference between the mean big endothelin-1 concentration in plasma and that in CSF. There was no significant correlation among concentrations of big endothelin-1, endothelin-1, and endothelin-3 in each paired sample. These results indicate that endothelin is present in human CSF that is differently processed from endothelin in vascular endothelial cells and suggest a possible role for endothelin as a modulator of neuronal functions.\r"

  ".U": "91035889\r", 
  ".W": "To examine the functioning of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in secondary adrenocortical insufficiency, we administered 100 micrograms synthetic human CRH, iv, plus 10 U lysine-8-vasopressin (LVP), im, three times daily for 3 consecutive days. The changes in plasma ACTH and cortisol levels during the administration and the response to an insulin tolerance test (ITT) conducted before and after the administration were determined. In three patients with isolated ACTH deficiency, basal plasma ACTH and cortisol levels were undetectablly low, and there was no response noted in the ITT or during CRH-LVP administration throughout the observation period. In four patients with adrenocortical insufficiency who had undergone successful transsphenoidal microadenomectomy for Cushing's disease and in six patients who had undergone curative unilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome, basal plasma ACTH levels were low, but responded considerably to both stimulation tests. Along with the 3 days of CRH-LVP stimulation, however, neither the peak nor the time-integrated ACTH response was significantly enhanced, because of the variability of the responses among the patients. Compared with the ACTH response on the last day of CRH-LVP stimulation, the subsequent ITT tended to induce a lower ACTH response in the post-Cushing's disease patients and a higher response in the post-Cushing's syndrome patients. Regarding the plasma cortisol levels, the basal, peak, and integrated responses tended to increase daily during CRH-LVP administration. Conversely, the ITT after repetitive CRH-LVP administration induced a higher cortisol response than the test before CRH-LVP administration in the post-Cushing's disease patients. No serious complications were noted in any of the patients during or after the treatment. The present findings indicate that 1) repetitive administration of CRH in combination with LVP is a safe and valuable provocation test to examine the pituitary ACTH reserve and the integrity of the pituitary-adrenocortical axis; 2) isolated ACTH deficiency is usually due to a defect at the pituitary level; 3) with respect to adrenocortical responsiveness, post-Cushing's disease patients show a better accumulation of the provocative effect than do post-Cushing's syndrome patients; and 4) both hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction are responsible for adrenal hypofunction in patients after hypercortisolemia, but post-Cushing's syndrome patients (especially those with a short period of hypercortisolemia) appeared to have less impairment of hypothalamic ACTH-releasing activity than post-Cushing's disease patients.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies it has been determined that food ingestion or glucose infusion suppresses serum insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) concentrations in normal subjects. It has not been determined, however, whether glucose-dependent suppression is due to enhancement of insulin-stimulated glucose transport, to some other insulin-mediated effect, or to a direct effect of glucose. These studies were undertaken to determine if infusion of other nutrients or energy sources that activate glycolysis, but not insulin secretion, could lead to suppression of the plasma concentrations of this protein. After infusion of 50 g glucose over 4 h, the mean plasma IGFBP-1 concentration fell from 44.3 +/- 13.8 to 17.4 +/- 8.1 micrograms/L (P less than 0.001). In contrast, when 50 g fructose were infused over 4 h, IGFBP-1 decreased from 44.6 +/- 7.4 to only 32.7 +/- 6.7 micrograms/L (P less than 0.01). Comparison of these changes showed that the mean decrease after glucose infusion was significantly greater than that after fructose (P less than 0.01). In contrast to these decreases, infusion of an isocaloric amount of triglycerides resulted in no significant change in IGFBP-1 concentrations (from 49.8 +/- 14.1 to 40.2 + 10.4 micrograms/L; P = NS). Concomitant measurements of immunoreactive C-peptide during the glucose and fructose infusions showed that plasma C-peptide levels rose from 1.6 +/- 0.2 to 3.9 +/- 0.7 nM (P less than 0.001) during the glucose infusion, whereas the maximum increase was from 1.7 +/- 0.4 to only 2.3 +/- 0.4 nM (P less than 0.05) during the fructose infusion. The difference between these mean changes was also significant. The change in C-peptide correlated inversely with the changes in IGFBP-1 during the glucose infusion (r = -0.68); P less than 0.001), but not during fructose infusion (r = -0.31). The results of this study suggest that insulin stimulation of cellular metabolic pathways is an important variable regulating the suppression of plasma IGFBP-1 concentrations. Activation of noninsulin-dependent glycolytic pathways appears to result in an equivalent degree of suppression, whereas provision of other energy substrates has no effect. We conclude that both insulin and glucose are important regulators of plasma concentrations of IGFBP-1 in vivo, and in this way they may significantly influence IGF action.\r"

Because of the proposed receptor-like role of these proteins in regulating cholesterol synthesis and the importance of the liver in the cholesterol metabolism of the body, we have studied the oxysterol-binding sites found in specimens of human liver. A protein that binds with high affinity to certain oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol has been identified and characterized in several ways. When 25-hydroxy-[3H]cholesterol is used as ligand, specific binding components can be identified in cytosolic liver extracts fractionated on sucrose density gradients in the fractions sedimenting at 4S and 7S. Cholesterol and steroid hormones do not compete for these binding components, but several oxysterols do. In cytosolic extracts, all binding appears to be a single class kinetically, with an apparent Kd of 28 x 10(-9) mol/L. We found the protein responsible to have a pI of about 4.8. Purification of the protein allowed preparation of an antiserum and subsequent immunoprecipitation of a photoaffinity-labeled component from crude cytosolic extracts. Electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates revealed a single specifically labeled protein band, with a mol wt of about 57,000. The protein described here may have a regulatory role in the synthesis of cholesterol in the human.\r"

Each subject was studied during two successive or near-successive menstrual cycles by repetitive blood sampling every 10 min for 24 h. Pulsatile parameters for LH and GH release were identified and characterized using the Cluster pulse detection algorithm. For LH, no significant differences existed in any parameter mean between the two 24-h admissions. Correlation coefficients for consecutive 24-h studies ranged from r = 0.22 (P less than 0.32) for number of LH peaks to r = 0.79 (P less than 0.0001) for 24-h integrated LH values (area under the concentration vs. time curve). No significant mean differences in any parameter were observed for consecutive 24-h GH evaluations. Correlation coefficients for 24-h GH ranged from r = 0.25 (P less than 0.34) for nadir to r = 0.71 (P less than 0.002) for incremental peak increase. Cosinor analysis was used to determine significant 24-h variations in LH and GH concentrations. Statistically significant differences existed between admissions for the amplitude of the nyctohemeral LH rhythm and its acrophase (time at which maximal hormone value was attained), but no mean differences were found for mesor (mean concentration). Correlation coefficients for LH were r = 0.10 (P less than 0.65), r = 0.43 (P less than 0.08), and r = 0.78 (P less than 0.0001) for phase, amplitude, and mesor, respectively. No significant mean differences existed for any parameter of nyctohemeral GH rhythms. Correlation coefficients were r = -0.18 (P less than 0.52), r = 0.49 (P less than 0.72), and r = 0.14 (P less than 0.80) for 24-h GH amplitude, phase, and mesor, respectively. We conclude that comparisons of mean and integrated LH and GH concentrations over a 24-h interval in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle are reliable; however, certain pulsatile properties responsible for the achievement of the mean daily concentrations of LH and GH may be nonuniform from menstrual cycle to menstrual cycle. In addition, nonuniformities may exist in the nyctohemeral rhythms of serum concentrations of LH and GH in the adult woman between cycles when a single 24-h time series is the basis for the analysis.\r"

In the present study we have investigated the relationship between insulin sensitivity and the acute effect of endogenous insulin secretion on circulating androgen levels. Insulin sensitivity, glucose-mediated insulin release, and glucose/insulin-stimulated androgen responses were determined during a frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test in a group of 19 women with clinical evidence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and 9 age- and weight-matched controls. Insulin (I), glucose, androstenedione, testosterone (T), free T, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels were measured before and during the 3 h following iv administration of glucose (300 mg/kg). Intravenous tolbutamide (300-500 mg) was injected 20 min after the glucose injection. Insulin sensitivity (SI) was calculated by application of the minimal model of glucose kinetics. Fasting androstenedione, T, free T, and I concentrations were significantly higher in the women with PCOS than in controls (P less than 0.02). In PCOS subjects, fasting I was correlated with both T (r = 0.51; P less than 0.05) and DHEA (r = 0.706; P less than 0.01). SI was significantly lower in PCOS subjects [SI, 68.35 +/- 8.34 min-1/(nmol/mL] than in control subjects (SI, 133.36 +/- 21.7 min-1/(nmol/mL)]. A significant decline in DHEA levels was observed in control subjects 3 h after glucose administration (from 28.4 +/- 3.0; final, 16.2 +/- 2.4; P less than 0.02). PCOS women with normal insulin sensitivity [SI, greater than 75.0 min-1/(nmol/mL)] showed a similar fall in DHEA (from 20.3 +/- 2.5 to 12.8 +/- 1.8 nmol/L; P less than 0.02). No significant change occurred in insulin-resistant PCOS subjects [SI, less than 75.0 min-1/(nmol/mL)]. Other androgen levels showed a modest nonsignificant decline during the study in PCOS and control groups. These findings confirm the weight-independent insulin resistance of some hyperandrogenic women. The failure of glucose-stimulated endogenous insulin secretion to significantly depress DHEA levels in insulin-resistant women with PCOS may account in part for their androgen excess.\r"

The majority of the inhibitory activity was in the IgG fraction purified by chromatography on a protein A-Sepharose affinity column and an anti-human IgG-agarose column. IgG fractions from non-inhibitory sera were inactive. Inhibitory IgG also inhibited the enzymatic activity of microsomal 5 alpha-reductase from liver, ventral prostate and preputial gland of rat, and liver, prostate, and facial skin of human. The inhibitory IgG had no effect on NADH-menadione reductase or 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. These results suggest that 5 alpha-reductase autoantibodies are present in the blood of some prostatic cancer patients.\r"

  ".W": "We have found that microM concentrations of the dopamine agonist bromocriptine significantly decrease the proliferation rate of human meningioma cells in culture (25-56% inhibition). This effect was also seen with direct application of dopamine, as well as the dopamine-D1 agonist (+)-SKF-38393 (both applied in microM concentrations) to meningioma cell cultures. Receptor studies with the dopamine-D1 ligand (125I)SCH-23982 (dopamine-D1 antagonist) indicated that dopamine-D1 binding sites were present in the membranes of meningioma tissue. The mean dissociation constant (Kd) was 325 ( +/- 74.5 SEM) pM and the receptor density (Bmax) was 25.4 ( +/- 1.5 SEM) fmol/mg pellet protein in 5 human meningiomas. The pharmacological specificity was proven by (+)-SKF-38393, ( +/-SKF-83566 or (+)-butaclamol and their inactive isomers (-)-SKF-38393 and (-)-butaclamol in a 1000 fold excess. These results provide evidence that human meningiomas possess high affinity dopamine-D1 receptors and that dopamine agonists have an antiproliferative effect on these tumors in culture. We conclude that the proliferation of cerebral meningiomas may be under dopaminergic control and that dopamine agonists may have a role in the medical treatment of patients with meningiomas.\r"

Our results indicate that the concentration of immunoreactive endothelin is elevated significantly in plasma obtained from women with preeclampsia and rapidly returns to a normal pregnancy value within 48 hours of delivery, as predicted by the prompt clinical resolution of this disorder. The findings suggest that endothelin may contribute to the vasospasm associated with this syndrome and lend further support to the involvement of endothelial cells in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia.\r"

The mRNA for the activin and inhibin subunits is expressed in the adrenal gland. Because members of the TGF-beta superfamily have effects on mitogenesis, we examined the effect of recombinant human activin-A (rh-activin-A) on proliferation of midgestation human fetal adrenal cells in vitro. Dose-dependent growth inhibition by rh-activin-A was obtained, with an ED50 of 1 ng/ml. Rh-activin-A inhibited basal and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated fetal zone cell proliferation, but did not alter basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-stimulated growth. TGF-beta combined with rh-activin-A demonstrated additive inhibition of fetal adrenal growth. These findings suggest a potential autocrine or paracrine role for activin-A in modulating the growth and/or subsequent involution of the human fetal adrenal gland.\r"

Probes were either labelled with digoxigenin by the random primer technique and detected with anti-digoxigenin antibody, or labelled with biotin by nick translation and detected with streptavidin, both methods having a common final visualisation procedure using alkaline phosphatase. Digoxigenin labelled probes proved two to 10-fold more sensitive by quantitative dot blotting and four-fold more sensitive in detecting HPV 16 DNA in a series of 31 anal carcinomas, compared with biotinylated probes. The digoxigenin method also produced less non-specific background staining of tissue sections than biotin labelled probes. It is concluded that digoxigenin DNA labelling and detection provides a simple, reliable, and efficient alternative to the use of biotin or radioactive isotopes for the detection of HPV DNA by in situ hybridisation. Digoxigenin labelled probes also offer the possibility of double labelling in situ hybridisation procedures when used with biotin labelled probes to provide simultaneous identification of different DNA sequences.\r"

Its efficacy was compared with that of biotin and radioisotope labelling methods. Three cases of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, two of verruca vulgaris, and seven cases of laryngeal papilloma were studied. The sensitivity of the DIG labelled probe was almost the same as that of a 35S-labelled probe in the dot-blot hybridisation test. Using in situ hybridisation with 35S-labelled and DIG labelled probes, the levels of the hybridised signals detected were similar. The biotin labelled probe was less sensitive, particularly in the cases of laryngeal papilloma. The DIG labelling and detection method was highly sensitive and applicable to the detection of viral infection by ISH, and is preferable to a radiolabelled probe, especially when in situ hybridisation is done in the pathology laboratory.\r"

Silver enhancement then permitted visualisation of the signal at the light microscopic level. The method was reliable and produced less background staining than previously described methods. The signal could be enhanced by epi polarisation microscopy. Furthermore, biotinylated DNA probes may be detected directly by a 1 nm gold labelled goat antibiotin antibody without loss of labelling intensity, and this may be preferable to the longer two layer technique, previously described.\r"

This high prevalence in parous women aged 40-59 years was significant. Fibroids, cervicitis, and endometrial hyperplasia were the most common associated diagnoses. Of all the associations studied, only endometrial hyperplasia was significantly more prevalent in the group with adenomyosis. Adenomyosis was stated as an indication for surgery in 69 patients and was confirmed by histopathology in 49 (71%). Preoperative suspicion of adenomyosis was present in 49 (20.6%) patients of all those ultimately found to have the disease. There is a high prevalence of adenomyosis in the population studied, which indicates that the condition may have been underdiagnosed in the past, especially as it is difficult to diagnose without surgery and hysterectomy is currently the only treatment.\r"

The possible effects of this morphological heterogeneity on the estimation of tumour ploidy were investigated. Multiple tissue blocks were systematically taken from 20 lung tumours and analysed by flow cytometry. The routine, archival paraffin wax embedded diagnostic blocks from these cases were also analysed. Nineteen (95%) of the tumours were shown to contain aneuploid stemlines by systematic sampling, but if only one of these systematic tissue blocks had been taken from each case the incidence of DNA aneuploidy could have been as low as 45%. Only 15 (75%) tumours were aneuploid when all the routine archival blocks were analysed, but by specifically selecting tumour areas from the archival material the accuracy of this method was increased to 90%. It is concluded that tumour sampling methods are of primary importance in assessing the DNA content of lung tumours. Routine paraffin wax embedded archival tissue provides a suitable source of material for this purpose, provided that \"turnover\" selection is carried out.\r"

Normal ileum (n = 10) was used as a control. Mucosal morphometry (using linear measurements), crypt cell proliferation (CCP) (using the monoclonal antibody Ki67), and epithelial HLA-DR expression (monoclonal antibody CR3/43) were assessed. CCP (expressed as the percentage of Ki67 positive nuclei for each crypt) was significantly higher in pouches with pouchitis, compared with those without, and in pouches without pouchitis compared with normal ileum. CCP values in some pouches without pouchitis approached values found in those with pouchitis. CCP was related inversely to villous height and an index of villous atrophy (VH/TMT), and directly to crypt depth. In the presence of pouchitis there was intense epithelial HLA-DR expression that extended into the crypts. In some pouches with high CCP values, but without clinically important inflammation, surface epithelial HLA-DR expression was weak and patchy. It is concluded that villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia in ileal pouches are associated with high CCP values. These may be increased even in the absence of active inflammation, and this increase may occur as a response to the new luminal environment.\r"

In a retrospective study 81% of the tests used had been non-discriminatory, but using the results of the remaining 19% of the tests, the computer was able to select the \"correct\" diagnosis with a high degree of certainty.

Nine out of 10 cases were monoclonal with respect to their light chain determinants; only one case with Burkitt's lymphoma with partial lymph node metastasis did not show light chain restriction. The cytological diagnosis included two mycobacterial infections and four cystic lesions.

Importantly, all cases of ALL were negative for both MPO7 and cytochemical MPO staining even when they were positive for CD13 and CD33.

  ".W": "Peripheral blood cytopenias are common in patients receiving intensive care, particularly in those with multiple organ failure. To assess the contribution of bone marrow hypoplasia in such patients 44 bone marrow samples from 24 patients under intensive care were studied by standard morphological techniques and by the granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cell (GM-CFC) assay. Frequently observed morphological abnormalities in the bone marrow included the following: (i) a reduction in overall cellularity in seven patients, with a progressive decrease in most patients studied sequentially; (ii) an increase in the number of actively phagocytic macrophages; and (iii) a disruption of normal bone marrow architecture with the accumulation of intercellular hyaluronic acid glycosaminoglycan. Mean GM-CFC growth was significantly reduced when compared with that in a group of normal controls. In four of five patients studied sequentially GM-CFC growth became subnormal in association with a reduction in bone marrow cellularity. Inhibitory serum factors were not identified. These morphological abnormalities are similar to the changes observed in gelatinous degeneration of the bone marrow. In both situations disruption of the haemopoietic microenvironment, with the accumulation of hyaluronic acid proteoglycan, may be an important factor in the inhibition of haemopoietic progenitor cell growth. The proliferation of macrophages, by the release of a variety of cytokines or reactive oxygen intermediates, may also be implicated in impaired haemopoiesis and the development of disordered erythropoiesis.\r"

Latex agglutination using ultrasonically disrupted Legionella pneumophila antigens coupled to latex particles, proved a rapid, simple method for detecting circulating antibodies to L pneumophila in a one minute slide latex agglutination test. There was good correlation with the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), and the specificity and sensitivity with respect to a diagnostic result were 98.3% and 97.6%, respectively, using a series of well characterised sera. The latex agglutination test seems well suited as a screening test for presumptive cases of Legionnaires' disease; the latex reagent is easy to prepare and seems to remain stable at 4 degrees C for up to six months.\r"

There were 68 positive results in 2258 unpaired Widal tests: 23 of them were falsely positive and 13 falsely negative, but in 11 out of 68 cases the Widal was the only positive laboratory test. It is concluded that routine clot culture is not cost effective if a sensitive blood culture method is used, and that the Widal test is useful only in selected patients.\r"

After inducing vigorous growth in brain heart infusion broth to stationary phase, all nutrients were removed by washing and the organisms resuspended in sterile deionised water with added magnesium. After further incubation the culture was centrifuged and the supernatant reacted with alcian blue in 50 mM magnesium chloride/sodium acetate solution, and the amount of bound dye was measured spectrophotometrically at 620 nm after its resolubilisation using sodium dodecyl sulphate. Large quantities of slime were produced by some, but not all, strains. Preliminary electrophoresis of the slime showed mobility and staining similar to that of the glycosaminoglycans. Adherence was tested by growing strains in wells of tissue culture plates and aspirating the supernatant after incubation. After fixation and staining of adherent growth the amount of bound stain was determined spectrophotometrically after its elution with ethanol. In this series of organisms there was no correlation between the result of tests for adherence or production of extracellular slime, and no correlation between either of these and the clinical source of the organisms.\r"

This method is not suitable for visualising PGA patterns in serum due to low PGA concentrations. To obtain a more sensitive visualisation method an immunoblotting technique was developed. PGA isozymogen patterns from urine and sonified gastric mucosa specimens obtained by immunoblotting were identical with those obtained by activity staining. The immunostaining method was at least 50 times more sensitive. PGA isozymogen patterns could be visualised in serum. Preliminary results suggest that the PGA patterns in serum and gastric mucosa are identical. As an association has been found between the genetically determined PGA isozymogen patterns in gastric mucosa and gastric malignancies in man, immunoblotting of PGA isozymogens in serum may provide a screening tool for subjects at risk of malignant gastric disease.\r"

Patches with the irritant were applied on day 0 for 24 hours. Skin changes were monitored by visual scoring and by the measurement of transepidermal water loss and capacitance as indicators of stratum corneum hydration on days 2, 3, 7, and 10. In forearm skin, irritant dermatitis developed in the majority of subjects as indicated by visual scoring and increase of transepidermal water loss. These changes were not significantly dependent on the concentration of sodium lauryl sulfate. In labia majora skin, irritant dermatitis developed in 50% of the women as determined by visual scoring; however, because of the pigmentation, visual scoring readings were less reliable in labia majora skin. Transepidermal water loss did not increase, but a significant and immediate decrease in capacitance was noted in labia majora skin. In forearm skin, postmenopausal women reacted less frequently and more slowly to sodium lauryl sulfate than premenopausal women whereas no age-related differences were observed in reaction of the vulvar skin. It is concluded that labia majora skin is not more reactive to sodium lauryl sulfate than forearm skin and that capacitance is more sensitive than transepidermal water loss in monitoring vulvar irritant dermatitis. Age-related differences in irritant reaction are apparent in the forearm, but not the vulva.\r"

Primary CTCL and ATL tend to involve papillary dermis with or without epidermotropism, whereas PTL and angioinvasive T cell lymphoma predominantly affect skin adnexae, vessels, and subcutis. Cutaneous lesions in type V PTL are heterogeneous and may be confused with panniculitis, vasculitis, or an eczematous eruption. Classic CTCL, Ki-1+ lymphoma, and angioinvasive T cell lymphoma have a chronic course, whereas ATL, Ki-1- large cell lymphoma, and PTL are clinically aggressive.\r"

Its occurrence in a lesion that had been present for 40 years suggested malignant transformation of a pre-existing benign eccrine acrospiroma. Each tumor showed little to no cellular atypia. Mitotic rates (mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields) varied both between and within lesions. Average mitotic rates did not differentiate the benign from the malignant tumors. The most important distinguishing features of large benign eccrine acrospiromas are the relative circumscription, the lack of cellular atypia, and the absence of stromal, perineurial, and angiolymphatic invasion.\r"

Hypergammaglobulinemic purpura is considered primary when there is no other associated disease or secondary when associated with other diseases, usually autoimmune.

The pain was assessed by the children and the physician as none, slight, moderate, or severe. In addition, the children rated the pain on a visual analog scale. EMLA cream effectively prevented the pain after all three application times (p less than 0.01). No significant difference in pain was observed among the 15-, 30-, and 60-minute EMLA-treated groups, but the proportion of children reporting no pain on the verbal scale increased from 36% in the 15-minute group to 61% in the 60-minute group. In the placebo group, only one of 24 children (4%) reported no pain. Transient local redness was the only skin reaction noted. In conclusion, an application time of EMLA cream of less than 60 minutes is satisfactory for the curettage of molluscum contagiosum in children.\r"

  ".W": "In a clinical trial of 172 patients at four medical centers, interferon alfa-2b (1.5 x 10(6) IU) or a placebo was injected directly into biopsy-proved noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas three times weekly for 3 weeks, for a cumulative dose of 13.5 million IU. Efficacy of treatment was determined at 16 to 20 weeks by examination of biopsy specimens that demonstrated cure of lesions in 86% of interferon-treated patients and in only 29% of placebo-treated patients. During the treatment course and follow-up, an initial inflammatory response was observed at the treatment sites, followed by diminished erythema, improvement in overall appearance, and a decrease in size of lesions. Side effects of treatment, mainly flu-like symptoms, were usually mild and transient and occurred more commonly in the interferon-treated group. Only three patients, all in the interferon-treated group, discontinued therapy because of side effects. One year after initiation of therapy, 81% of interferon recipients and 20% of those given the placebo remained tumor free. Noduloulcerative and superficial lesions were equally responsive to treatment with interferon. For some patients with noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas, intralesional interferon alfa-2b may be an alternative, effective treatment.\r"

  ".U": "91036185\r", 
  ".W": "Four patients with chronic refractory plaque-type psoriasis without arthropathy were treated with extracorporeal photopheresis every other week for 6 to 13 months. In patients 1 and 2, methotrexate was administered concomitantly during the initial part of the trial; the dose was gradually tapered and the drug was discontinued by 6 months. Both patients improved to 23% and 62% of baseline values for percentage of body surface involvement, but their disease then flared when maintenance extracorporeal photopheresis was used alone. Substantial improvement again occurred when lower doses of methotrexate were administered with extracorporeal photopheresis. Patients 3 and 4 were treated initially with extracorporeal photopheresis alone and both improved to 50% and 52% of baseline body surface involvement, respectively, after 4 months of treatment. However, their disease flared because of factors unrelated to treatment. Extracorporeal photopheresis was well tolerated by all patients without evidence of overt toxicity. However, prolonged treatment with extracorporeal photopheresis/methotrexate was accompanied by a decrease in skin reactivity to recall antigens and by decreased capacity of lymphocytes to produce interleukin 2 in response to polyclonal stimuli in vitro. These findings indicate that alternate-week extracorporeal photopheresis has a definite but incomplete suppressive effect on psoriasis vulgaris that may be mediated through an effect on lymphokine production by photomodified cells and that the therapeutic effect of extracorporeal photopheresis may be enhanced by concomitant administration of low doses of methotrexate.\r"

These elements include recognition of potential cutaneous irritants and allergens, engineering controls or chemical substitution to prevent skin exposure, personal protection with appropriate clothing or barrier creams, personal and environmental hygiene, regulation of potential allergens and irritants within the workplace, educational efforts to promote awareness of potential allergens and irritants, motivational techniques to promote safe work conditions and practices, and preemployment and periodic health screening. A comprehensive prevention program based on this multidimensional approach requires the cooperative efforts of employees, employers, engineers, chemists, industrial hygienists, safety and supervisory personnel, union representatives, governmental agencies, and occupational health practitioners.\r"

The status of antifungal therapy changed dramatically in the late 1960s with the introduction of newer broader spectrum agents, such as the iodinated trichlorophenols and the imidazoles, that acted by disruption of the fungal cell membrane. Some of the more recently developed broad-spectrum antifungal drugs include the triazoles terconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole and the dimethylmorpholine amorolfine. The allylamines represent one of the newest classes of compounds shown to be effective in the management of fungal disorders. The two members of this unique chemical class that have been studied clinically, naftifine and terbinafine, are effective against a wide spectrum of fungal organisms. Terbinafine has the added advantage of both topical and oral activity.\r"

Others include failure of the patient to comply with the prescribed treatment regimen, drug degradation in the liver, drug-drug interactions, reabsorption or washout of the drug from the stratum corneum, and failure of the drug to reach the stratum corneum. Excretion in the eccrine sweat is the principal pathway by which griseofulvin and ketoconazole, the two currently available oral antifungal agents, are delivered to the stratum corneum. Measures that promote delivery of these drugs to this site by enhancing sweating and minimizing drug run-off and absorption onto clothing may aid in optimizing the therapeutic response to these agents.\r"

In vitro, terbinafine is exceptionally active against dermatophytes, molds, and dimorphic fungi in which it exerts a fungicidal action.

Results of mycologic tests and clinical findings showed terbinafine to be significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of tinea pedis. Significantly more terbinafine-treated patients than placebo-treated patients showed conversion to negative culture and microscopy at end of therapy and a significant reduction in scored signs and symptoms. Overall efficacy at follow-up (combined mycologic and clinical findings) was also significantly greater in the terbinafine group (78%) than in the placebo group (zero) (p less than 0.001).

Patients applied the test medications to the affected area twice daily for 2 weeks. Therapeutic response was evaluable in 18 patients after each week of treatment and at a follow-up visit 2 weeks after therapy ended. At each visit, terbinafine was found to be more effective than the cream vehicle in the reduction of the signs and symptoms of infection and in the conversion of culture and microscopy findings to negative or normal. At the end of treatment, therapy was effective in 67% of the nine terbinafine-treated patients compared with only 11% of the nine placebo-treated patients. At the follow-up examination, efficacy rates were 78% in the terbinafine treatment group and 33% in the placebo group--a difference of borderline statistical significance (p = 0.077). Possible reasons for this result may include the higher incidence of chronic disease in the terbinafine group and the large number of patients who were classified as delayed exclusions because of negative initial culture for dermatophytes. No side effects or significant alterations in laboratory or hematologic tests were observed in either treatment group.\r"

Both groups were similar in age, sex, duration of disease, prior therapy, size and location of lesion, infecting organism, and predisposing factors.

In addition, there was a higher conversion rate to negative culture and normal microscopy findings in the terbinafine-treated group.

Cutaneous melanoma also may aggregate in families, usually in the setting of dysplastic melanocytic nevi.

We present a case of glove and stocking hypoesthesia, weakness of the flexor muscle of the right great toe, palpable thickening of the right popliteal nerve, and hypoesthetic but normal-appearing areas on the back, which developed in a Trinidadian immigrant who lived in Canada for 16 years. A skin biopsy specimen obtained from a visibly normal but hypoesthetic area on the back demonstrated a few acid-fast bacteria in small dermal nerves, in arrector pili smooth muscle, and in rare perivascular histiocytes, associated with a sparse mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. The patient responded well to therapy with dapsone, rifampin, and clofazamine. A classification and review of primarily neural leprosy is presented. Our patient represents the first reported case of primarily neural borderline lepromatous leprosy in Canada.\r"

Among the epidermal changes associated with skin aging are a flattened dermal-epidermal junction, giving the appearance of atrophy and cellular heterogeneity. The melanocyte density declines slowly, and the Langerhans cells decrease in number with advancing age. Among the dermal changes are attenuation in the number and diameter of elastic fibers in the papillary dermis, an increase in number and thickness of the same fibers in the reticular dermis, and a coarsening of collagen fibers with an increase in density of the collagen network. A decrease in the dermal cell population as well as a functional decline in glandular activity are also noted with intrinsic aging. A decline in hair number, rate of growth, and diameter, along with a slowing of the rate of growth of nails, have been well documented with progressive aging.\r"

Processes that are associated with cellular damage and aging are the production of free radicals (a process much enhanced after ultraviolet irradiation) and an increasing number of errors during DNA replication. Cellular manifestations of intrinsic aging include decreased life span of cells, decreased responsiveness of cells to growth signals, which may reflect loss of cellular receptors to growth factors, and increased responsiveness to growth inhibitors. All these findings are more pronounced in cells derived from photodamaged skin. Molecular manifestations of intrinsic aging, studied mainly in fibroblasts, are altered membrane composition, adhesion properties, production of extracellular matrix, and activity of the enzyme catalase. Molecular changes as a result of photoaging are less well characterized; published studies mainly target differences in composition of the extracellular dermal matrix.\r"

All of these factors point to a greater need for adult dental services. Therefore, in the next 30 years, the dental profession should be prepared to provide increased amounts of diagnostic, preventive, adult operative, fixed prosthodontic, and endodontic and orthodontic services.

The native coronary arteries were classified into 15 angiographic segments and 3 arterial trunks for analysis of progression of coronary artery disease. The incidence rate of disease progression in coronary segments was 24% and 28% in medically and surgically treated patients, respectively (p = NS). Grafted segments showed a 38% rate of disease progression, which was higher than the 18% rate of for nongrafted segments (p less than 0.001) and the overall rate of 24% for medically treated patients (p less than 0.01). Similarly, 29 (94%) of 31 grafted arteries exhibited disease progression compared with 19 (59%) of 32 nongrafted arteries (p less than 0.01) and 42 (67%) of 63 arteries in medically treated patients (p less than 0.01). In grafted vessels, disease progression occurred more often in arteries proximal (84%) to the anastomosis than in arteries distal (16%) to graft insertion (p less than 0.001). Progression occurred in 46% of proximal segments compared with 23% of distal segments (p less than 0.02). Progression was seen in 23 (55%) of 43 segments with an occluded graft compared with 30 (31%) of 96 segments with a patent graft (p less than 0.02). Ten years after randomization, medically and surgically treated patients showed a comparable rate of disease progression in coronary segments. However, surgical therapy appeared to significantly accelerate atherosclerotic progression in the grafted vessels, especially in the proximal portions. Occluded grafts also correlated with an adverse effect on disease progression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) includes 780 patients with mild or moderate stable angina pectoris or asymptomatic survivors of a myocardial infarction who were randomized to either medical or surgical therapy and 1,319 patients who were eligible for randomization but were not randomized (randomizable patients). There were no substantial aggregate differences observed in any of the survival comparisons after 10 years of follow-up study between the randomized and randomizable patients assigned to the medical (79% versus 80%) or surgical (82% versus 81%) groups or in patient subgroups stratified according to coronary artery disease extent and left ventricular ejection fraction. Cox regression analyses were done with independent variables known to be predictors of survival, including surgical versus medical therapy and randomized versus randomizable group, to test the null hypothesis of a mortality difference between medical versus surgical assignment according to group assignment (randomized versus randomizable). In no case did the initial group category enter as a significant predictor of survival. The results in the randomizable group reinforce those in the randomized group with respect to the medical versus surgical comparison. Two subgroups are identified with a significant surgical advantage: 1) patients with proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis greater than or equal to 70% and an ejection fraction less than 0.50, and 2) patients with three vessel coronary artery disease and an ejection fraction less than 0.50. In both groups, coronary bypass surgery had a statistically significant beneficial effect on survival (p less than 0.05). After a decade of follow-up, the CASS randomizable patients confirm conclusions reached on the basis of the CASS randomized trial.\r"

In the streptokinase group the infarct-related artery was patent in 55 patients (76%). Compared with stenoses in the stable angina group, there were no differences in the stenosis length, severity, calcification or in the proportion located at an acute bend or at a branch point. However, lesions in the streptokinase group were more often irregular (p less than 0.005) and eccentric (p less than 0.01), had a shoulder (p less than 0.0001), globular filling defects (p less than 0.01), linear filling defects (p less than 0.00005) and contrast staining (p less than 0.05). Plaque ulceration index was higher in the streptokinase than in the stable angina group (6.2 +/- 7.9 versus 3.5 +/- 3.4, p less than 0.001). Of the 72 streptokinase-treated patients, 35 were maintained on heparin infusion until angioplasty 2 to 10 days later. At repeat angiography before angioplasty, globular lesion filling defects seen in eight patients had disappeared, whereas linear filling defects persisted in 7 of 14 cases. Fewer lesions were irregular (p less than 0.0001) and the ulceration index decreased from 7.4 +/- 10.4 to 3.0 +/- 1.6 (p less than 0.001). These data show that the lesion in the infarct-related artery after streptokinase treatment is irregular and often associated with filling defects, perhaps corresponding to plaque fissuring and intraluminal thrombosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Direct coronary angioplasty without antecedent thrombolytic therapy was performed during evolving myocardial infarction in 285 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease at 5.2 +/- 4.2 h after the onset of chest pain. Two vessel disease was present in 163 patients (57%) and three vessel disease in 122 (43%). An anterior infarct was present in 123 patients (43%), cardiogenic shock in 33 (12%) and age greater than or equal to 70 years in 59 (21%). Angioplasty of the infarct-related vessel was successful in 256 patients (90%), including 92% with two vessel and 88% with three vessel disease (p = NS). Emergency bypass surgery was needed in six patients (2%). In-hospital death occurred in 33 patients (12%), including 13 with two vessel and 20 with three vessel disease (p less than 0.05). The mortality rate was only 4% in the subgroup of 101 patients who met entry criteria for thrombolytic trials. The in-hospital mortality rate was 45% in patients in shock and 7% in patients not in shock (p less than 0.01). Logistic regression analysis identified shock and age greater than or equal to 70 years as independently associated with in-hospital death. In 135 patients who underwent predischarge left ventriculography, global ejection fraction increased from 50% to 57% (p less than 0.001) and regional wall motion in the infarct zone improved in 59% of patients.

Patients with coronary artery disease had a higher homocyst(e)ine level than control subjects (13.66 +/- 6.44 versus 10.93 +/- 4.92 nmol/ml, p less than 0.001). High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were lower (32 +/- 10 versus 46 +/- 13 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) and triglycerides levels were higher (193 +/- 103 versus 136 +/- 106 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) in the coronary disease group. Plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were not significantly different between patients with coronary disease and control subjects. The presence of hypertension, smoking or diabetes mellitus did not significantly alter homocyst(e)ine levels in the patient or the control group. Patients who were not taking a beta-adrenergic blocking drug (n = 70) had a nonsignificantly higher homocyst(e)ine level than did patients taking this class of drugs (n = 100) (14.67 +/- 8.92 versus 12.95 +/- 3.77 nmol/ml, p = 0.087). By design, none of the control subjects were taking a beta-blocker. No significant correlations were observed between homocyst(e)ine and age, serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels. It is concluded that an elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine level is an independent risk factor for the development of premature coronary atherosclerosis in men.\r"

  ".W": "Anginal perceptual threshold (the time from onset of 0.1 mV of ST segment depression to onset of angina during treadmill exercise) is prolonged in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease. In the present study, the functional significance of this perceptual abnormality was evaluated by analysis of its effect on exercise capacity and the severity of myocardial ischemia. Treadmill exercise in 32 diabetic patients and 36 nondiabetic control patients showed a close linear correlation between the time to onset of electrical ischemia (ST segment depression) and exercise capacity in both groups (r = 0.8 and 0.9, respectively; p less than 0.001). However, the slope of the relation was flatter in the diabetic group because prolongation of the anginal perceptual threshold permitted continued exercise as ischemia intensified. The anginal perceptual threshold itself showed a close linear correlation with exercise capacity in the diabetic group (r = 0.8, p less than 0.001), although in the nondiabetic group these variables were unrelated. The permissive effect of a prolonged anginal perceptual threshold on exercise capacity is undesirable as reflected by its correlation with ischemia at peak exercise (r = 0.6, p less than 0.001): the longer the threshold, the greater the exercise capacity and the more severe the ischemia. Indeed, the inverse relation between the severity of ischemia at peak exercise and exercise capacity in the nondiabetic group (r = 0.4, p less than 0.02) was completely lost in the diabetic group. Thus, in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease, anginal perceptual threshold is a major determinant of exercise capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sympathetic nerve activity was significantly higher in the patients with heart failure (54.7 +/- 4.5 bursts/min) than in normal subjects (16.7 +/- 2.2 bursts/min, p less than 0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that sympathetic activity in these human subjects was most strongly and inversely correlated with left ventricular stroke work index (r = -0.86, p less than 0.0001) and stroke volume index (r = -0.85, p less than 0.0001). There was a strong positive correlation between sympathetic nerve activity and pulmonary artery diastolic (r = 0.82, p less than 0.0001) and mean (r = 0.81, p less than 0.0001) pressures. Similar correlations were seen when patients with heart failure were analyzed separately. There was no significant correlation between sympathetic nerve activity and mean arterial pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction (by radionuclide ventriculography), cardiac chamber size (by echocardiography) or arterial oxygen tension in the patients with heart failure. Direct measurements of sympathetic nerve activity correlated closely with plasma norepinephrine (r = 0.72, p less than 0.0001) in patients with heart failure. Thus, sympathetic nerve activity at rest parallels impairment of cardiac performance in patients with heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnostic use of exercise echocardiography has been widely reported. However, transthoracic exercise echocardiography is inadequate in up to 20% of patients because of poor image quality related to exercise. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, a system was developed in which transesophageal echocardiography is combined with simultaneous transesophageal atrial pacing by means of the same probe. In a prospective study, transesophageal echocardiography was performed before, during and immediately after maximal atrial pacing in 50 patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Results of transesophageal stress echocardiography were considered abnormal when new pacing-induced regional wall motion abnormalities were observed. Correlative routine bicycle exercise testing was carried out in 44 patients. Cardiac catheterization was performed in all patients. The success rate in obtaining high quality diagnostic images was 100% by transesophageal echocardiography. All nine patients without angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease had a normal result on the transesophageal stress echocardiogram (100% specificity). Thirty-eight of 41 patients with coronary artery disease (defined as greater than or equal to 50% luminal diameter narrowing of at least one major vessel) had an abnormal result on the transesophageal stress echocardiogram (93% sensitivity). The sensitivity of the technique for one, two or three vessel disease was 85%, 100% and 100%, respectively, compared with 44%, 50% and 83%, respectively, for bicycle exercise testing; the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during rapid atrial pacing showed a sensitivity of 25%, 64% and 86%, respectively. Thus, rapid atrial pacing combined with simultaneous transesophageal echocardiography is a highly specific and sensitive technique for the detection of coronary artery disease. Ischemia-induced wall motion abnormalities were detected earlier than observed ECG changes. The technique appears to be particularly suited to patients who are unable to perform an active stress test or those with poor quality transthoracic echocardiograms.\r"

Seventeen patients who had undergone coronary arteriography were studied with N-13 glutamate at peak supine exercise using a bicycle ergometer, as well as with the flow tracer N-13 ammonia at peak exercise during a second similar exercise test. Six of the patients also underwent imaging with N-13 glutamate at rest before exercise testing; in the remaining 11 patients imaging with fluorine-18 (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose was performed to assess glucose metabolism after the second exercise test. Seven patients had classic metabolism-flow mismatches consistent with ischemia (that is, decreased N-13 ammonia uptake in a region with relatively increased F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake). There was no evidence of increased N-13 glutamate uptake in the ischemic mismatched regions in any of these patients. In all 17 patients, the uptake of N-13 glutamate during exercise paralleled the uptake of N-13 ammonia during exercise, suggesting that N-13 glutamate behaves as a flow tracer rather than as a metabolic marker of ischemia in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Reference values for normal left atrial dimensions have been based primarily on blind M-mode measurements, with no reports based on two-dimensional echocardiography to provide a comprehensive analysis of the two-dimensional measurements from infancy to old age. This report analyzes the left atrial dimensions from two-dimensional echocardiographic studies in 268 normal healthy subjects to determine normal limits and relations among linear, area and volume measurements of the left atrium. The group mean values change with body size, fitting well to the exponential growth model (r = 0.78 to 0.92). The variance about the mean (which determines normal limits) is represented effectively by a quadratic function of body surface area (r = 0.84 to 0.99). The variables determined by this modeling simplify evaluation of normal limits for any body size at any desired level of confidence, and the data are useful reference standards for interpretation of two-dimensional echocardiograms.\r"

  ".U": "91036494\r", 
  ".W": "To explore the mechanisms of change of left ventricular diastolic filling associated with preload and afterload reduction, the influence of nitroprusside on the transmitral flow velocity pattern, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and left ventricular pressure interaction was studied in 11 patients with end-stage heart failure. Pulsed Doppler echocardiographic recordings of mitral inflow were obtained with simultaneous high fidelity left ventricular and phase-corrected pulmonary capillary wedge pressure recordings before and during levels of nitroprusside infusion. With nitroprusside, left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures decreased by 14% and 41% (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.05), respectively, and cardiac output increased by 67% (p less than 0.05). The pulmonary capillary wedge-left ventricular crossover pressure decreased by 41% (p less than 0.05), but the time constant of isovolumetric left ventricular pressure decrease T was insignificantly changed. Isovolumetric relaxation time and acceleration and deceleration times of the early diastolic filling wave were significantly prolonged with nitroprusside infusion (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05, respectively). Peak early diastolic filling velocity was maintained (65 +/- 11 to 62 +/- 13 cm/s, p = NS) in spite of the decreased absolute crossover pressure. Changes in peak early diastolic filling velocity correlated weakly with changes in the crossover pressure (r = 0.48, p less than 0.05) and correlated better with the crossover to left ventricular minimal pressure difference (r = 0.78, p less than 0.05). Peak early diastolic filling velocity appears to be most affected by the early diastolic pulmonary capillary wedge to left ventricular pressure difference rather than the absolute pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The lack of peak flow velocity change during nitroprusside infusion could be explained by either the associated decrease in left ventricular minimal pressure or downward shift of left ventricular diastolic pressure by the same amount as the decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. This may reflect a reduction of external constraint to ventricular distensibility produced by a reduction in filling volume in patients with a markedly dilated ventricle. Thus, a prolonged early diastolic filling period and preserved peak early diastolic filling velocity in spite of decreased left ventricular filling pressure and constant relaxation rate are associated with the beneficial effects of nitroprusside on left ventricular function in patients with severe congestive heart failure.\r"

Most commonly, the electrode catheter is removed after each study and a new catheter reinserted through the femoral vein for every subsequent test. An alternative method employs an electrode catheter that remains in place during several days of serial testing. Little is known about differences between these two methods with respect to the likelihood of induction of arrhythmia or the frequency of complications. To determine whether inducibility of sustained arrhythmia is altered or if the frequency of complications is unacceptably high with use of an indwelling catheter, a prospective randomized study was conducted in 78 patients. Each patient underwent baseline testing, several days of electropharmacologic testing with an indwelling catheter, a 24 h drug elimination period and placement of a new electrode catheter. Ventricular stimulation studies were then performed in each patient with both the indwelling and new electrode catheters. No differences were found between the indwelling and new catheter tests with respect to induction of arrhythmia, number of extrastimuli required to induce arrhythmia, rate of arrhythmia or requirement for cardioversion. Ventricular pacing thresholds were higher and effective refractory periods were slightly longer when measured with the indwelling catheter. Complications related to the 156 catheter insertions included two that may have been related to the indwelling catheter (one episode of staphylococcal sepsis and one presumed pulmonary embolism) and four that were related to invasive procedures (pneumothorax in all). There were no long-term adverse sequelae of these complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Determinants of the ventricular cycle length during atrial fibrillation were examined in 52 patients. Thirty-three patients had structural heart disease and none had an accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection. The AV node effective and functional refractory periods, the shortest atrial pacing cycle length associated with 1:1 conduction, the AV node conduction time and indexes of concealed conduction in the AV node were measured in the baseline state (36 patients) and after modification of sympathetic tone by infusion of isoproterenol or propranolol (8 patients each). Atrial fibrillation was then induced with rapid atrial pacing, and the mean, shortest and longest ventricular cycle lengths were measured. Variables that correlated most strongly with the mean RR interval during atrial fibrillation were the AV node effective refractory period (r = 0.93; p less than 0.001), AV node functional refractory period (r = 0.87; p less than 0.001) and shortest atrial pacing cycle length associated with 1:1 conduction (r = 0.91; p less than 0.001). The AH interval during sinus rhythm (r = 0.74; p less than 0.001) and during atrial pacing at the shortest cycle length with 1:1 conduction (r = 0.52; p less than 0.001) had weaker correlations. Measures of concealed conduction did not improve the prediction of the mean or longest ventricular cycle length during atrial fibrillation. In conclusion, the refractory periods and conductivity of the AV node are the best indicators of the potential of the node to transmit atrial impulses to the ventricles during atrial fibrillation. The degree of concealed conduction in the AV node is a less important determinant of the mean ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation.\r"

To evaluate the atrial contribution to ventricular pump performance in heart transplant recipients, arterial pressure and cardiac output during pacing from either chamber were measured in nine patients 10 +/- 1 days after transplantation. Systolic, diastolic and mean systemic arterial pressures were significantly higher during atrial pacing compared with ventricular pacing: 143 +/- 23 versus 125 +/- 20 mm Hg, 73 +/- 15 versus 66 +/- 14 mm Hg and 94 +/- 17 versus 84 +/- 16 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.05 for all). In addition, cardiac output decreased from 5.5 +/- 1.4 to 4.6 +/- 1.5 liters/min (p less than 0.005) for atrial versus ventricular pacing. Thus, there is a significant atrial contribution to cardiac performance in patients after heart transplantation. This may have clinical implications in those patients who later require a permanent pacemaker.\r"

The findings by either technique were correlated with findings at cardiac catheterization (12 patients) and at surgery (5 patients). In two of six patients with an absent AV connection as defined by transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal imaging demonstrated an imperforate AV valve. In 11 of 11 patients with a discordant or criss-cross connection, assessment of AV valve and ventricular morphology (by defining the chordal attachments of both AV valves) was possible with transesophageal echocardiography (3 of 11 patients by transthoracic echocardiography); chordal straddling was detected in 1 patient and excluded in 3 others with an associated inlet ventricular septal defect. Anomalous pulmonary venous connection (one patient), atrial septal defect (three patients) and subpulmonary stenosis (five patients) were better assessed by transesophageal imaging, and atrial appendage morphology could be demonstrated in all. The transesophageal technique was less useful in demonstrating the anterior subaortic infundibulum or aortopulmonary shunt (two patients). Although systemic ventricular function could be assessed by either method with use of short-axis M-mode scans, transesophageal pulsed Doppler interrogation of AV valve and pulmonary venous flow patterns provided clues to diastolic dysfunction of the systemic ventricle.\r"

Among those whose tachycardia began at age 0 to 2 months, it disappeared in 93% and persisted in 7%. In 31%, it disappeared and reappeared at an average age of 8 years. Among patients whose tachycardia was present after age 5 years, it was persistent in 78% at a mean follow-up period of 7 years. Accessory connection location was mapped by electrophysiologic study in 87 patients and estimated by electrocardiography in 53 patients. There were no differences in tachycardia onset or recurrence based on accessory connection location. Congenital heart defects were present in 37% of all patients, 23% of whom had Ebstein's anomaly. Among all patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, 63% of those with a congenital heart defect had a rightsided accessory connection, whereas 61% of patients with a normal heart had a left-sided connection (p less than 0.01). Multiple accessory connections were found in 12% of patients with a congenital heart defect compared with 6% of those without such a defect. In conclusion: 1) supraventricular tachycardia due to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome that begins in infancy may disappear, but it frequently recurs in later childhood; 2) if tachycardia is present after age 5 years, it persists in greater than 75% of patients; and 3) the location of the accessory connection does not affect the clinical course of tachycardia in children with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.\r"

The two groups were comparable except for a shorter follow-up duration (7 +/- 3 versus 12.4 +/- 7 years) and a younger age at evaluation (12.4 +/- 5 versus 16.9 +/- 7 years) in group 1. Complete right bundle branch block was less frequent in group 1 than in group 2 (20% versus 50%, p less than 0.05) but three of the four patients with complete atrioventricular (AV) block detected on ambulatory monitoring were in group 1. Six patients had significant supraventricular arrhythmias, all well tolerated. Ambulatory monitoring revealed significant ventricular arrhythmias (modified Lown grade 2 or higher) in 39 patients, with a lower prevalence in group 1 (30% versus 48%, p = 0.05). No correlation was found between prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias and right ventricular systolic pressure, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, presence of a synthetic patch, previous pulmonary artery banding, presence of complete right bundle branch block and cardiomegaly on chest X-ray film. Prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias increased with follow-up duration, age at evaluation and age at surgery. These were always well tolerated and did not warrant treatment. Thus, right atriotomy reduces the prevalence of right bundle branch block but does not prevent late AV block. Ventricular arrhythmias are frequent after surgical closure of ventricular septal defect whatever the surgical approach and their prevalence is not statistically different from that in postoperative tetralogy of Fallot.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In nine patients (Group A), propafenone prevented induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia (noninducible in four, nonsustained [less than 30 s] in five). In the other 16 patients (Group B), sustained ventricular tachycardia was still inducible; in 11 of the 16, the tachycardia configuration was unchanged but the cycle length was significantly longer (431 +/- 99 versus 284 +/- 44 ms, p less than 0.001). Propafenone did not significantly affect either sinus cycle length or AH and HV intervals. However, it prolonged QRS duration during sinus rhythm equally in both groups of patients. With ventricular pacing, propafenone also prolonged right ventricular effective and functional refractory periods and surface QRS duration. There was greater lengthening of the paced surface QRS duration when drug therapy was ineffective (for example, +35 +/- 12 ms in Group A versus +69 +/- 23 ms in Group B at a basic drive of 400 ms, p less than 0.01). Drug-induced prolongation of a paced QRS complex greater than 40 ms had a 94% positive predictive value for drug failure to prevent induction of ventricular tachycardia. Drug-induced percent prolongation of ventricular tachycardia cycle length in Group B did not correlate well with percent QRS prolongation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Relapse of endomyocardial fibrosis has not been observed after surgical correction. Reoperations have been carried out because of complications of valve prostheses. A new surgical technique for removal of ventricular fibrous tissue with preservation of the mitral and tricuspid valves was used in nine consecutive patients with endomyocardial fibrosis. Initial results show a reduction of pulmonary hypertension, mean right and left atrial pressures and end-diastolic pressures in both ventricles. Tricuspid annuloplasty was performed in seven patients and mitral annuloplasty in five. No valve prosthesis was used. There was no death and New York Heart Association functional class improved from class III or IV in the preoperative period to class I or II in the postoperative period.

The previously established relation between initial ST segment elevation and final electrocardiographic (ECG) myocardial infarct size in patients without coronary reperfusion might therefore be altered by thrombolytic therapy. The effect of intravenous streptokinase on this relation was therefore studied in 73 patients with initial acute myocardial infarction who had participated in the Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2). Patients who received streptokinase were considered as one group and patients who did not receive streptokinase as a control group. Final myocardial infarct size, which was estimated from the QRS score, was predicted from the admission standard ECG by previously developed formulas based on ST segment elevation. In the 40 control patients there was no change from ST-predicted to final QRS-estimated infarct size (median 17.7% versus 18.3%; p = NS). In the 33 patients in the streptokinase group, there was a highly significant decrease from predicted to final myocardial infarct size (median 21.9% versus 16.2%; p less than 0.0002). This decrease was found for both anterior (median 23.7% versus 19.5%; p less than 0.03) and inferior (median 21.9% versus 12.0%; p = 0.001) infarct locations. Multiple regression analysis adjusting for differences in predicted infarct size confirmed the significance of streptokinase on the difference in infarct size (p = 0.006). Based on the variability of the percent change from predicted to final infarct size in the control group, a threshold decrease greater than or equal to 20% is required for identification of salvage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Different degrees of stenosis were placed in random order on the left anterior descending coronary artery. For each stenosis, myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed by injecting sonicated albumin microbubbles into the cross-clamped aortic root at the time of delivery of cardioplegic solution. The resultant echocardiographic images were analyzed on an off-line computer. Background-subtracted time-intensity plots were generated, and an exponential function, f(t) = Ce-alpha t + De- beta t, was applied to each plot. Variables that reflected the total number of microbubbles entering the coronary artery bed, such as the area under the curve and the peak height of the curve, correlated best with radiolabeled microsphere-measured myocardial flow (r = 0.92 and r = 0.91, respectively). Variables that reflected the appearance of contrast microbubbles in the myocardium, such as the initial slope and the slope at 1 s, also had a good correlation with myocardial flow (r = 0.84 and r = 0.89, respectively). Variables that reflected the washout of contrast medium from the myocardium, such as the slope of the descending portion of the curve, had only a fair correlation with myocardial flow (r = 0.65). In six dogs, the technique of injecting contrast medium into the cross-clamped aortic root was also examined. Although continuous infusion of contrast medium produced smaller perturbations in mean aortic and distal left anterior descending artery pressures compared with a bolus injection (p less than 0.01), the correlation between the variables of the time-intensity curves and flow was equally close with both techniques. It is concluded that it is possible to quantitate myocardial flow by using myocardial contrast echocardiography at the time of delivery of cardioplegic solution in dogs on cardiopulmonary bypass. The implementation of this technique in humans might be useful in guiding the sequence of graft placement and thereby improving myocardial preservation during coronary artery bypass operations.\r"

The biodistribution of indium-111-labeled antimyosin antibody Fab on days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after encephalomyocarditis virus inoculation demonstrated that myocardial uptake increased significantly on days 5, 7 and 14 (maximum on day 7) in infected versus uninfected mice (p less than 0.001). In vivo kinetics in infected mice on day 7 demonstrated that the heart to blood ratio reached a maximum 48 h after the intravenous administration of indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab, which was considered to be the optimal time for scintigraphy. The scintigraphic images obtained with indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab demonstrated positive uptake in the cardiac lesion in infected mice. The pathologic study demonstrated that myocardial uptake correlated well with pathologic grades of myocardial necrosis. High performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of an antigen-antibody complex in the circulation of infected mice after the injection of indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab. This antigen bound to indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab in the circulation might be whole myosin and this complex may decrease myocardial uptake and increase liver uptake. It is concluded that indium-111-labeled antimyosin monoclonal antibody Fab accumulates selectively in damaged heart tissue in mice with acute myocarditis and that indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab scintigraphy may be a useful method for the visualization of acute myocarditis.\r"

The right atrium was paced at a constant cycle length of 600 ms. A left ventricular endocardial monophasic action potential catheter was used to detect early afterdepolarizations. Prostacyclin (0.2 microgram/kg per min) reduced the amplitude of the early afterdepolarizations (39.2 +/- 8.4% of the monophasic action potential amplitude during control study to 28.7 +/- 5.5%, n = 10; p less than 0.001) as well as the prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (11 of 14 dogs during control study to 5 of 14 dogs; p = 0.031).

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of endothelin-1 on the coronary vascular bed of closed chest pigs. Endothelin-1 (3 to 30 pmol/kg body weight) was selectively administered into the left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary blood flow and epicardial vessel diameter were measured by quantitative arteriography. Arterial pressure increased after a 30 pmol/kg dose and heart rate was not changed. Coronary blood flow and vessel diameter of the left anterior descending artery significantly decreased by 74% and 32%, respectively (p less than 0.01 versus control) after the 30 pmol/kg dose, whereas these variables modestly decreased in the left circumflex artery. Endothelin-1 in doses of 10 to 30 pmol/kg produced electrocardiographic ST segment elevation associated with decreased oxygen saturation of coronary sinus venous blood. Endothelin-induced coronary vasoconstriction was significantly inhibited after treatment with intravenous diltiazem (0.2 mg/kg, n = 6) or nifedipine (0.1 mg/kg, n = 5), but not after vehicle administration (n = 4). This study demonstrates that intracoronary administration of endothelin-1 causes significant myocardial ischemia through coronary vasoconstriction, which is inhibited by a calcium channel blocker. The data suggest that calcium influx into the smooth muscle cells appears to be involved at least in part in the mechanism of endothelin-induced coronary vasoconstriction in vivo.\r"

Trichloroethylene, trichloroethane and dichlorethylene were the principal contaminants in the groundwater. A previous study of chick embryos demonstrated that when injected into the air sacs of fertilized eggs trichloroethylene produced more than three times the number of cardiac defects that are found in control embryos. This mammalian study demonstrates similar effects of trichloroethylene and dichloroethylene when applied under provocative circumstances (that is, solutions delivered through a catheter into the gravid uterus from an intraperitoneal osmotic pump) to the developing rat fetus in utero during the period of organ differentiation and development. Furthermore, the effect is dose dependent for both agents. Although only a very small number of congenital heart anomalies (3%) were found in the control group, 9% and 12.5% were found in the lower dose trichloroethylene and dichloroethylene groups and 14% and 21% in the higher dose groups, respectively (p less than 0.05). A variety of cardiac defects were found. Dichloroethylene appears to be at least as great a cardiac teratogen as trichloroethylene even though it was administered at a 10-fold lower concentration. These agents appear to be specific cardiac teratogens because only a single noncardiac anomaly was found. This study in a rat model demonstrates a dose-dependent relation between fetal exposure to trichloroethylene and dichloroethylene in utero during the period of organogenesis and the appearance of a variety of congenital cardiac defects.\r"

To determine the feasibility of reducing right heart valved conduit stenosis with a balloon expandable stent, a baboon model was used, in which the pulmonary artery was ligated and a right ventricular to pulmonary artery 14 mm bioprosthetic Dacron valved conduit implanted. In five baboons, at an average of 40 months after valved conduit implantation, fibrointimal stenosis at the valve site resulted in narrowing and a mean transconduit pressure gradient of 49 mm Hg (range 33 to 65). A tubular slotted steel stent (1.2 cm long) was deployed within the valved conduit after inflation of an 8 to 15 mm diameter balloon catheter that was introduced through the femoral vein. A stent was delivered to all valved conduits; however, in two baboons, balloon undersizing resulted in stent dislodgment. In the remaining three baboons, the transconduit gradient was reduced by 59% (49 to 20 mm Hg) and right ventricular systolic pressure decreased acutely by 35% (77 to 50 mm Hg). It is concluded that stent deployment is feasible in right ventricular to pulmonary artery stenotic valved conduits and may result in significant hemodynamic improvement. However, successful stent delivery is critically dependent on the proper selection of stent length and balloon diameter.\r"

Transthoracic echocardiography detected ruptured chordae tendineae in 6 patients from Group I (sensitivity 35%) and flail leaflets in 11 patients from Group I (sensitivity 65%). Transesophageal echocardiography disclosed ruptured chordae tendineae in all 17 Group I patients (sensitivity 100%); the sensitivity was significantly higher than that of transthoracic echocardiography. No abnormal chordal echoes were visualized in any patient from Group II by either transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography (specificity 100%). Transesophageal echocardiography is a highly sensitive method for detecting ruptured chordae tendineae and is superior to transthoracic echocardiography in establishing its diagnosis.\r"

When percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty is performed on such patients, there is a potential risk of thrombus dislodgment and embolization. In this study conventional transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography were performed for percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty on 19 consecutive candidates (6 men, 13 women, 23 to 81 years old). In five patients (26%), transesophageal echocardiography revealed a left atrial thrombus; in only one of these was there a suspicion of left atrial thrombus on transthoracic echocardiography. Balloon mitral valvuloplasty was canceled in four of the five patients. Three underwent mitral valve surgery that confirmed the echocardiographic findings. Transesophageal echocardiography is better than conventional transthoracic echocardiography in detecting left atrial clots in candidates for balloon mitral valvuloplasty. Because of the potential risk of embolization, transesophageal echocardiography is recommended in all candidates for balloon mitral valvuloplasty.\r"

Ejection fraction data were available in 1,084 patients; of these, 557 were receiving a beta-blocker and 527 were not. In addition to ejection fraction, other correlates of left ventricular function included the presence or absence of pulmonary rales, chest X-ray film evidence of pulmonary congestion and the presence of an S3 gallop. Beta-blocker use was less frequent in patients with an ejection fraction less than 30%, rales, an S3 gallop and pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray film. Twenty-one percent of patients with an ejection fraction less than 30%, 42% of patients with rales, 28% of patients with an S3 gallop and 28% of patients with pulmonary congestion were receiving beta-blocker therapy. For every correlate of left ventricular function, the chance of developing congestive heart failure was greater in patients with diminished left ventricular function than in those without. For each level of left ventricular function, the chance of developing congestive heart failure requiring treatment was greater in patients not taking a beta-blocker.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Complete revascularization was defined as successful angioplasty of one or more vessels that resulted in no residual coronary lesion with greater than 50% diameter stenosis. Restenosis was defined as a residual stenosis at the time of repeat angiography of greater than 50% of luminal diameter. Restenosis occurred in 40% of the patients. The 111 patients were randomly subdivided into a learning group (n = 84) and a testing group (n = 27). A logistic discriminant analysis was performed in the learning group and the logistic model was used to estimate a logistic probability of restenosis. This probability of restenosis was validated in the testing group. In the learning group of 84 patients univariate analysis of 39 factors revealed 8 factors related to restenosis: recurrence of angina (p less than 0.0001), postangioplasty abnormal finding on exercise thallium-201 scintigram (p less than 0.0001), exercise thallium-201 scintigram score (p less than 0.0001), difference between exercise and rest ST segment depression (p less than 0.001), postangioplasty exercise ST segment depression (p less than 0.001), absolute postangioplasty stenosis diameter (p less than 0.003), postangioplasty exercise work load (p less than 0.03) and postangioplasty exercise heart rate (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Coronary angioplasty may be performed to relieve angina after surgery either to the native coronary vessels or to grafts. Failure of attempted coronary angioplasty may mandate repeat coronary surgery, often in the setting of acute ischemia. From 1980 to 1989, 1,263 patients with prior coronary bypass surgery underwent angioplasty; of these patients, 46 (3.6%) underwent reoperation for failed angioplasty during the same hospital stay. Of the 46 patients who underwent reoperation, 33 had and 13 did not have acute ischemia. In the group with ischemia, 3 patients (9.1%) died and 14 (42.4%) died or had a Q wave myocardial infarction in the hospital compared with no deaths (p = NS) and no deaths or Q wave myocardial infarction (p = 0.005) in the group without ischemia. At 3 years, the actuarial survival rate was 88 +/- 6% in the group with ischemia, whereas there were no deaths in the group without ischemia (p = NS), and freedom from death or myocardial infarction was 51 +/- 10% in the group with ischemia, versus no events in the group without ischemia (p = 0.006). In most patients with prior coronary bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty was performed without the need for repeat coronary bypass surgery. Should coronary angioplasty fail, reoperation in patients without acute ischemia can be performed with overall patient survival comparable to that of elective reoperative coronary bypass without coronary angioplasty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 71 patients surviving 6 months after balloon aortic valvuloplasty, 41 agreed to late recatheterization. All patients had pre- and postvalvuloplasty and 6 month catheterization data measured with high fidelity micromanometer pressure recordings and simultaneous digital subtraction left ventriculography. The hemodynamic result immediately after valvuloplasty included a reduction in the aortic valve gradient and a moderate increase in aortic valve area (0.51 +/- 0.14 to 0.81 +/- 0.19 cm2, p less than 0.0001). Ejection fraction increased slightly (52 +/- 18 to 55 +/- 17%, p less than 0.0001) despite a decrease in peak positive rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt 1,650 +/- 460 to 1,500 +/- 490 mm Hg/s, p less than 0.05). There was also a decrease in left ventricular afterload and a small decrease in preload. At 6 month recatheterization, the mean aortic valve gradient and area were similar to baseline values, with 31 (76%) of 41 patients demonstrating valvular restenosis. At 6 months many left ventricular hemodynamic variables, including peak positive dP/dt and stroke work, also resembled prevalvuloplasty values. However, left ventricular end-diastolic volume was reduced (111 +/- 40 ml at 6 months versus 136 +/- 52 ml before valvuloplasty, p less than 0.01). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was unchanged from prevalvuloplasty values in the study group of 41 patients, but was significantly improved in 9 of 15 patients with a baseline ejection fraction less than 50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The causes of chest pain in patients found to have angiographically normal coronary arteries during cardiac catheterization remain controversial. Cardiac sensitivity to catheter manipulation, pacing at various stimulus intensities and intracoronary injection of contrast medium was examined in several groups of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Right heart (especially right ventricular) catheter manipulation and pacing and intracoronary contrast medium provoked chest pain typical of that previously experienced in 29 (81%) of 36 patients with chest pain and angiographically normal coronary arteries and 15 (46%) of 33 symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In contrast, only 2 (6%) of 33 symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease experienced their typical chest pain with these sensitivity tests (p less than 0.001). None of 10 patients with valvular heart disease but without a chest pain syndrome experienced any sensation with these tests. Cutaneous pain threshold testing demonstrated that patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries had a higher pain threshold to thermal stimulation compared with patients who had coronary artery disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. No relation existed between cardiac sensitivity and cutaneous sensitivity testing. Thus, patients who have chest pain despite angiographically normal coronary arteries may have abnormal cardiac sensitivity to a variety of stimuli. This increased sensitivity may be of causal importance to their chest pain syndrome or may contribute to their perception of ischemia-induced pain. The same phenomenon was also commonly seen in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Whether this phenomenon represents abnormal activation of pain receptors within the heart or abnormal processing of visceral afferent neural impulses in the peripheral or central nervous system is unknown.\r"

To determine the effect of posture, central hemodynamics were studied in 20 patients during a change from supine to sitting and during graded upright bicycle exercise (group U) and were compared with those of 20 patients matched for age, gender and time from transplantation who were studied after passive leg elevation and during exercise in the supine posture (group S). Passive leg elevation resulted in a 9% increase in stroke index (34 +/- 6 to 37 +/- 6 ml/m2, p less than 0.001) and a 10% increase in cardiac index (3.1 +/- 0.4 to 3.4 +/- 0.5 liters/min per m2, p less than 0.001) in group S patients compared with a 15% reduction in stroke index (34 +/- 7 to 29 +/- 6 ml/m2, p less than 0.001) and a 9% decrease in cardiac index (3.2 +/- 0.6 to 2.9 +/- 0.5 liters/min per m2, p less than 0.001) in group U patients on assuming the sitting posture.

  ".W": "The feasibility, safety and diagnostic accuracy of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with thallium-201 imaging during adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia were evaluated in 53 patients with and 7 without coronary artery disease proved by coronary angiography. Adenosine was infused intravenously at a dose of 0.14 mg/kg body weight per min for 6 min and thallium was injected at 3 min. Adenosine caused an increase in heart rate (68 +/- 12 at baseline versus 87 +/- 18 beats/min at peak effect, p less than 0.0001) but no change in blood pressure. The sensitivity and specificity were 92% (95% confidence intervals 81% to 98%) and 100% (95% confidence intervals 59% to 100%), respectively; 20 (61%) of 33 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease were also correctly identified. In 30 patients, the predictive accuracy of adenosine thallium imaging was slightly higher than that of exercise SPECT thallium imaging (90% versus 80%, p = NS) (95% confidence intervals 72% to 97% and 61% to 92%, respectively). In 25 patients, two-dimensional echocardiography during adenosine infusion disclosed a new wall motion abnormality in 2 (10%) of 20 patients with coronary artery disease; 80% of these patients had reversible thallium defects (p less than 0.001). Side effects were mild and transient; aminophylline was used in only three patients. Thus, adenosine SPECT thallium imaging provides a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The results are comparable with those of exercise SPECT thallium imaging. Most reversible defects in the adenosine study are not associated with any transient wall motion abnormality.\r"

Echocardiograms and Doppler recordings were performed in 18 normal young men (aged 23 to 32 years) during various levels of lower body negative pressure (0, -20 and -50 mm Hg). Lower body negative pressure induced a reduction in diastolic velocity integral (from 12.17 +/- 0.79 to 8.42 +/- 0.71 cm, p = 0.0067) and consequently left ventricular diastolic diameter (from 5.11 +/- 0.09 to 4.45 +/- 0.1 cm, p less than 0.0001). There was a significant reflex increase in heart rate from 59.9 +/- 1.9 to 77.1 +/- 2.4 beats/min (p less than 0.0001), but blood pressure was unchanged. This reduction in preload altered Doppler transmittral filling patterns as follows: 1) peak early velocity (E) decreased from 59.2 +/- 3.8 to 39.1 +/- 1.7 cm/s (p less than 0.0001); 2) atrial filing velocity (A) was unchanged (35.58 +/- 1.5 to 33.52 +/- 1.4 cm/s, p = 0.517); 3) E/A ratio decreased from 1.7 +/- 0.13 to 1.19 +/- 0.08 (p = 0.0087); 4) mean acceleration (from 482 +/- 37 to 390 +/- 27 cm/s2, p = 0.03) and mean deceleration (from 327 +/- 31 to 169 +/- 21 cm/s2, p less than 0.001) of the early filling wave were significantly reduced; and 5) peak acceleration (from 907 +/- 42 to 829 +/- 29 cm/s2) and peak deceleration (from 771 +/- 94 to 547 +/- 76 cm/s2) also decreased, but not significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cardiac output was calculated with use of the Doppler catheter-determined instantaneous space-average velocity and the ultrasonically determined instantaneous vessel area. Doppler flow and thermodilution were compared with electromagnetic flow in the in vitro model and with Fick cardiac output in patients. Doppler catheter-determined flow was highly predictive of electro-magnetic flow in the pulsatile flow model (r = 0.99, slope [m] = 1.01 and SEE = 0.05) and appeared comparable to thermodilution measurements (r = 1.00, m = 1.03 and SEE = 0.02). In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, Doppler catheter-determined cardiac output appeared to modestly underestimate Fick cardiac output (r = 0.82, m = 0.80 and SEE = 0.09; mean error +/- SEM = -0.26 +/- 0.14 liters/min). However, predictive accuracy was comparable to simultaneously obtained thermodilution measurements (r = 0.85, m = 1.07 and SEE = 0.10; mean error +/- SEM = 0.61 +/- 0.16 liters/min). This new Doppler catheter system utilizes multiple ultrasound transducers to provide angle-independent measurements of vessel diameter and instantaneous velocity within the main pulmonary artery, resulting in a more accurate assessment of Doppler-derived cardiac output. In addition, useful information concerning hemodynamic variables such as peak flow, acceleration, deceleration, stroke work and pulmonary impedance may be derived.\r"

All patients received either procainamide (12 to 15 mg/kg body weight) or propafenone (1 to 2 mg/kg) during sustained (greater than 10 min) atrial fibrillation or after termination of nonsustained atrial fibrillation. Termination of atrial fibrillation was attributed to a drug if it occurred less than or equal to 15 min after infusion. Measurements included mean cycle length of fibrillatory electrograms (mean AA interval) as measured at the high right atrium and shortest RR interval between pre-excited cycles during atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation terminated more frequently after procainamide administration (65%) than after propafenone (46%), although this difference was not significant. Procainamide prolonged the shortest pre-excited RR interval (228 +/- 41 to 339 +/- 23 ms, p = 0.0001) as did propafenone (215 +/- 40 to 415 +/- 198 ms, p = 0.0001) and the magnitude of increase was greater for propafenone (p = 0.048). Patients with sustained atrial fibrillation had shorter mean AA intervals than did their counterparts with nonsustained atrial fibrillation (123 +/- 25 versus 186 +/- 35 ms, p = 0.0001). Termination of sustained atrial fibrillation by either drug was accompanied by prolongation of the mean AA interval but not necessarily by the shortest pre-excited RR interval. Termination of atrial fibrillation was heralded by a 68% increase in the mean AA interval after procainamide administration compared with a 30% increase when the arrhythmia persisted. For propafenone the increases were 90% and 68%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seventy-one of the patients (75%) had no underlying heart disease. The electrophysiologic tests were performed to evaluate supraventricular tachycardias (n = 47), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (n = 20), unexplained syncope (n = 21), palpitation (n = 9) or intermittent heart block (n = 2). A mean of 2.8 +/- 0.5 6F electrode catheters were inserted through a femoral vein. An electrode catheter was inserted into a subclavian or internal jugular vein in 28 tests and a 5F cannula was inserted into a femoral artery to monitor the blood pressure in 20 tests. The results of 61 tests (61%) were abnormal. Patients were monitored for a mean of 3.8 +/- 1.2 h after the procedure and then discharged. No complications occurred. For cost analysis a subgroup of 60 of these patients was matched for age, gender, heart disease and indication for electrophysiologic testing with a group of 60 patients who underwent electrophysiologic testing as inpatients. Physicians' fees for the two groups were similar; however, the mean hospital charge was $5,845 +/- 3,763 for the inpatient group compared with only $2,120 +/- 1,244 for the outpatient group (p less than 0.001). Thus, outpatient electrophysiologic testing is feasible and safe and results in substantial cost savings in patients without life-threatening arrhythmias.\r"

Angioplasty was considered successful (residual cross-sectional luminal area greater than 25%) on pathologic examination in 14 arteries and unsuccessful in 26 arteries. Eccentric plaques were more likely to be successfully dilated than were concentric lesions (p less than 0.05). Six (50%) of 12 fibropultaceous plaques were successfully dilated compared with only 8 (29%) of 28 fibrous plaques. Moderate to severe calcification did not preclude morphologic success. Medial stretching or dissection, or both, was more often associated with a successful result. Thus, plaque morphology may be an important determinant of pathologic outcome after coronary angioplasty.\r"

The clinical and pathologic features of three patients who died after coronary atherectomy are described. Tissue fragments obtained with atherectomy demonstrated atheromatous and fibroproliferative intima, media and adventitia. At autopsy, treated vascular segments (from the left anterior descending artery in two patients and a vein graft in one patient) demonstrated discrete defects in the vascular wall. Defects extending into atheroma, media or adventitia corresponded with the presence of these tissues in the atherectomy specimens. Tissues were otherwise not disrupted in the manner associated with balloon angioplasty. Acute mural thrombus deposition was evident in the resection zone in one patient. Late findings included fibroproliferative intimal tissue extending from the resected areas into the vascular lumen. In one patient intimal hyperplasia was sufficient to narrow the vascular lumen by 82% and was implicated in subsequent myocardial ischemia and infarction. The study indicates that 1) the vascular injury associated with atherectomy is distinct from that associated with balloon angioplasty, 2) acute mural thrombus deposition may occur even with resection limited to the intima, and 3) intimal hyperplasia may develop in regions treated with atherectomy and may be associated with late myocardial ischemia and infarction.\r"

To investigate this phenomenon noninvasively, two-dimensional Doppler color flow echocardiography was used in 77 patients (aged 1 day to 15.5 years, mean 24 months). During isovolumetric contraction, flow was seen from the left to the right ventricle in 82 (98%) of 84 studies. During isovolumetric relaxation, right to left flow was noted in 72 (96%) of 75 studies. During early diastole in patients with an isolated defect, flow was initially from the right to the left ventricle and subsequently reversed to become left to right in 29 (91%) of 32 studies. In patients with concomitant right ventricular volume overload, flow across the ventricular defect was from the right to the left ventricle throughout diastole in 30 (86%) of 35 studies. In each of four patients with d-transposition of the great vessels and each of two patients with 1-transposition of the great vessels, blood flow was from the morphologic left ventricle to the morphologic right ventricle during isovolumetric contraction and from the morphologic right ventricle to the morphologic left ventricle during isovolumetric relaxation. These results demonstrate 1) the complex nature of intracardiac shunting in children with ventricular septal defect as previously shown by angiography; 2) an intrinsic functional difference in the contractile and relaxation properties of the morphologic left and right ventricles; and 3) differences in diastolic blood flow patterns between children with an isolated defect and those with a ventricular septal defect and right ventricular volume overload (p = 0.0001).\r"

These abnormalities included isolated pulmonary valve stenosis (n = 9), septal (dynamic) subpulmonary stenosis (n = 5), anatomic (fixed) subpulmonary stenosis (n = 7), abnormal mitral chordae attachments (n = 2) or a combination of abnormalities (n = 7). There were two early deaths, one of which was due to previously unrecognized mitral stenosis and a subpulmonary (neo-aortic) membrane and one late death due to presumed coronary obstruction. Of the nine patients with pulmonary valve abnormalities due to either a bicommissural (n = 5) or a thickened tricommissural (n = 4) valve, only one underwent valvotomy. Peak systolic ejection gradients in these nine patients measured preoperatively ranged from 0 to 50 mm Hg. At follow-up study 5 to 30 months postoperatively, the neo-aortic valve gradient was less than or equal to 15 mm Hg in all patients; three patients had mild neo-aortic regurgitation. Preoperative gradients may overestimate the degree of obstruction because of the increased pulmonary blood flow present in transposition. No patient with \"dynamic\" subpulmonary obstruction before the arterial switch operation had a surgical procedure performed on the left ventricular outflow tract; none had evidence of subaortic obstruction after the arterial switch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91036537\r", 
  ".W": "Banding the pulmonary trunk may exacerbate or promote the development of subaortic stenosis in patients with double inlet ventricle or tricuspid atresia with a dominant left ventricle and discordant ventriculoarterial connection and, therefore, may be an inappropriate palliative procedure for such patients. To examine this possibility, 102 consecutive infants were studied who presented with this anatomy between 1972 and 1987. Obstruction of the aortic arch was present in 52 patients. In 28 patients (17 with aortic arch obstruction), subaortic stenosis was already apparent at presentation. Of the remaining 74 patients, 19 received no palliative surgery and 55 underwent banding of the pulmonary trunk either with (n = 22) or without (n = 33) aortic arch repair. Outcome was significantly worse in patients with associated aortic arch obstruction. All such patients either died or developed subaortic stenosis by 3 years of age (survival free of subaortic stenosis 0 of 22 versus 22 of 33 for patients with isolated banding of the pulmonary trunk, p less than 0.001). After isolated banding, there was a lower ratio of the ventricular septal defect to ascending aorta diameters at presentation in the patients who developed subaortic stenosis than in the patients who did not (0.60 +/- 0.08 versus 1.03 +/- 0.15, p less than 0.001). Of the latter, 18 (95%) of 19 patients fulfilled criteria for a Fontan procedure at recatheterization. Thus, the presence of aortic arch obstruction is associated with rapid development of subaortic stenosis after banding of the pulmonary trunk. Alternative initial surgery, even though high risk, may be indicated. In the absence of such obstruction, banding the pulmonary trunk can be performed at reasonable risk and, provided that the ventricular septal defect is of adequate size, satisfactorily prepares most patients for a later Fontan procedure.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term follow-up study (41 +/- 23 months) of 47 patients undergoing direct current ablation because of drug-resistant supraventricular arrhythmias is reported. Significant early complications occurred in four patients and included hypotension, pericarditis, nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and one sudden death. In 42 patients (86%), complete atrioventricular (AV) block was initially achieved. During the follow-up period, AV conduction resumed in 2 of these 42 patients. Of the seven patients in whom ablation was unsuccessful, two developed late complete AV block and three had symptomatic improvement. An improved activity level was reported among 83% of the patients with successful ablation. Health care utilization manifest as the number of hospital admissions per year before and after ablation decreased significantly after ablation (2.4 +/- 2.0 versus 0.3 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.001). Echocardiographic evaluation in five patients with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (27 +/- 7%) before ablation showed a significant increase (45 +/- 14%, p less than 0.05) after an average follow-up period of 31 months. New onset of congestive heart failure occurred after ablation in four patients, of whom two had no structural heart disease. The total mortality rate, including the one patient with sudden death, was 17% and was significantly higher among patients with underlying structural heart disease. Transcatheter direct current ablation is an effective treatment in patients with drug-resistant supraventricular tachycardia, providing a beneficial long-term outcome including an improved quality of life and a decrease in health care utilization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the effect of intravenous cocaine (0.5 to 2 mg/kg body weight) on the coronary circulation and systemic hemodynamics in closed chest sedated dogs. The role of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in mediating these effects was also investigated. Cocaine produced dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure and rate-pressure product. Although the lower doses of cocaine had no significant effect on the coronary circulation, the 2 mg/kg dose produced a 55 +/- 14% increase in coronary vascular resistance (p less than 0.05 versus baseline) and a 19 +/- 3% reduction in diameter of the left anterior descending coronary artery (p less than 0.05 versus baseline). Despite these potentially deleterious effects on the coronary circulation (occurring at a time of markedly increased myocardial oxygen demand), the electrocardiogram did not demonstrate ischemic changes and there was no myocardial lactate production. Cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction was abolished by pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine, but not by pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. The findings that cocaine did not change systemic vascular resistance in dogs without adrenergic blockade, reduced systemic vascular resistance in dogs after alpha-blockade (p less than 0.05) and increased systemic vascular resistance in dogs after beta-blockade (p = 0.06) suggest that epinephrine (rather than norepinephrine) is primarily responsible for the peripheral vascular actions of cocaine. Thus, in this canine preparation with normal coronary arteries, cocaine produced vasoconstriction of both epicardial and coronary resistance vessels that was not associated with evidence of myocardial ischemia. The pharmacologic mechanism for the effect of cocaine on the coronary circulation is alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation, whereas systemic hemodynamic effects are mediated by combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on cardiovascular mass and function were measured in three groups of 22 week old male Wistar-Kyoto normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with CGS-16617, cilazapril or quinapril. Left ventricular performance was assessed by electromagnetic flow meter during rapid whole blood infusion before and after arterial pressure and increased abruptly with aortic snare; aortic distensibility also was assessed in vitro. The systemic hemodynamic effects of these three agents were similar, yet their structural effects varied. Although left ventricular and aortic masses diminished and right ventricular mass remained unchanged (with all three agents) in the spontaneously hypertensive rats, CGS-11617 and cilazapril also reduced left ventricular mass in the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats without changing aortic mass. All three agents improved aortic distensibility whether or not mass was decreased. Left ventricular structural changes were associated with variable changes in pumping ability. These data show that reduced mass associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment was not consistent in ventricles and aorta, that a dissociation exists between structural and functional changes and that reduction of cardiac mass alone does not relate to changes in chamber mass or in function. Thus, biologic and pharmacodynamic differences exist among angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as well as between classes of antihypertensive agents.\r"

  ".W": "Heart-reactive antibodies are commonly observed in patients with myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. Such antibodies may be important in the pathogenesis of these disorders, yet the specific antigens recognized have not been studied systematically. This report characterizes circulating heart autoantibodies from patients with myocarditis (n = 17) or idiopathic cardiomyopathy (n = 71) and from healthy volunteers (n = 15). Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that high titer (greater than or equal to 1:20) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody activity occurred in 59% of the myocarditis samples, 20% of the cardiomyopathy samples and none of the normal samples. All samples were tested by Western immunoblotting for IgG activity against a normal human heart extract. The number of antigens recognized by each sample was enumerated and the molecular weight of each antigen estimated; the prevalence of reactivity against antigens in selected molecular weight classes was determined. There was no difference in the mean number of heart antigens recognized by serum from each group. For most weight classes, prevalence either did not differ significantly among the various groups or subgroups or was greatest among samples from healthy volunteers. Prevalence of reactivity with 190 to 199 kilodalton (kd) antigens was greatest (p less than 0.05) among low titer serum samples from patients with myocarditis. High titer cardiomyopathy serum differed from normal serum by an increased (p less than 0.05) prevalence of antibodies to 40 to 49 and 100 to 109 kd antigens. These results suggest that western immunostaining may ultimately contribute substantively to identifying patients with myocarditis or cardiomyopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Technetium-99m-labeled agents have advantages over thallium-201 in terms of photon statistics, cost and clinical availability. They have been suggested as an alternative to thallium for myocardial perfusion imaging. Teboroxime is a new boronic acid adduct of technetium dioxime (BATO) compound that demonstrates favorable characteristics in preliminary studies. With use of a novel (seated) patient positioning technique and a rapid dynamic acquisition protocol, 30 patients underwent planar imaging with teboroxoime while at rest and after maximal treadmill exercise. Postexercise scans were completed in an average time (mean +/- SD) of 4.4 +/- 1.6 min, with 4.8 +/- 1.5 min for the views at rest. These results were compared with coronary arteriography or thallium scintigraphy after treadmill exercise, or both. Diagnostic agreement (abnormal versus normal) was present in 28 of the 30 patients (p less than 0.001). Regarding physiologic assessment as compared with thallium scintigraphy, the finding of infarction and ischemia was concordant in 89% and 86% of patients, respectively. This report describes the initial use of teboroxime with a rapid dynamic planar imaging technique, resulting in a high correlation with exercise thallium scintigraphy. Delayed postexercise images obtained 5 to 10 min after exercise demonstrated rapid disappearance of exercise-induced defects noted on the initial (0 to 5 min) postexercise views. The rapid differential washout with teboroxime has not been previously described and the possible clinical significance is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Serum levels of DHEA sulfate are inversely associated with cardiovascular death in men, and urinary dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels are inversely associated with clinical manifestations of coronary artery disease. These observations may be related to the antiproliferative effects of DHEA, resulting in inhibition of atherosclerotic intimal hyperplasia. To examine the relation between these steroids and a direct measure of coronary atherosclerosis, plasma DHEA and DHEA sulfate levels were determined in 206 middle-aged patients (103 men, 103 women) undergoing elective coronary angiography. Plasma DHEA sulfate levels were lower in men with at least one stenosis greater than or equal to 50% compared with those without any stenosis greater than or equal to 50% (4.9 +/- 2.7 versus 6.1 +/- 3.5 nmol/ml, p = 0.05). Levels of DHEA sulfate were also inversely related to the number of diseased coronary vessels (r = -0.20, p = 0.05) and a continuous measure of the extent of coronary atherosclerosis (r = -0.25, p = 0.01) in men. The association between DHEA sulfate levels and extent of coronary artery disease was independent of age and other conventional risk factors for coronary disease. In women, there was no association between plasma DHEA or DHEA sulfate levels and coronary disease. These data demonstrate a consistent, independent, inverse, dose-response relation between plasma DHEA sulfate levels and angiographically defined coronary atherosclerosis in men. Plasma DHEA sulfate may be another important and potentially modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Alveolar macrophages (AMs) and mast cells reside in the airway, and both have been demonstrated to contribute independently to allergic inflammatory responses through the generation of respiratory-burst metabolites and the release of biologically active mediators, respectively. Since mast cell granules (MCGs) contain mediators that could potentially interact with the AM respiratory burst, we investigated the effects of isolated MCGs on this important inflammatory pathway of the AM. MCGs and AMs were obtained by peritoneal and tracheoalveolar lavage, respectively, of Sprague-Dawley rats. First, the overall respiratory-burst activity was measured by luminal-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL), and second, the individual oxygen species contributing to CL (superoxide anion [O2-], hydrogen peroxide [H2O2], and hypochlorous acid) were measured. MCGs alone enhanced AM CL responses to an equivalent degree compared to zymosan-stimulated AMs. However, AMs preincubated with MCGs followed by zymosan stimulation significantly and synergistically enhanced the CL responses. This enhanced CL was not due to an increased production of O2-, H2O2, or hypochlorous acid; in fact, there were decreased measured amounts of O2- and H2O2 from zymosan-stimulated AMs in the presence of MCGs, most likely caused by the content of granules of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase, respectively. The lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, completely abolished the enhanced CL of AM preincubated with MCGs and subsequently stimulated by zymosan, but O2- production was not affected by nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Taken together, these results suggest that derivatives of arachidonic acid metabolism, most likely those of the lipoxygenase pathway, are responsible for the enhanced AM CL response observed in the presence of MCGs. Thus, mast cell-macrophage interactions may be important within the airway in enhancing the generation of mediators that contribute to tissue inflammation and bronchospasm.\r"
