  ".W": "DNA polymerase beta (pol beta) is a constitutively expressed DNA repair enzyme in vertebrate cells. Yet, it had been shown previously that the pol beta mRNA level increases in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells within 4 h after treatment with several monofunctional DNA damaging agents, notably, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Herein we report that a transfected pol beta promoter fusion gene is activated by MNNG treatment of CHO cells; mRNA from the transfected gene is approximately 10-fold higher in treated cells than in untreated cells 16 h after treatment. This activation is mediated through the decanucleotide palindromic element GTGACGTCAC at positions -49 to -40 in the \"TATA-less\" core promoter. This element, which is similar to the ATF/CREB transcription factor-binding site in a number of mammalian genes, forms the center of a strong protein-binding site for CHO cell nuclear extract proteins. Mutated pol beta promoter fusion genes lacking the element fail to bind protein at this site and fail to respond to MNNG treatment of cells.\r"

However, in contrast to the common somatic histones, CENP-A is quantitatively retained in bull spermatozoa, and we have exploited this fact to purify CENP-A to apparent homogeneity. Partial sequence analysis of the purified protein indicates that CENP-A is a distinctive gene product. Some CENP-A sequences are highly similar to regions of histone H3. Other segments of CENP-A are not related to H3 or any other histone. These unrelated segments are presumably involved in localizing CENP-A to centromeric DNA or in centromere-specific functions of CENP-A.\r"

  ".W": "Proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) represents an important event in vascular lesion formation. Despite the common belief that growth factors contribute to the development of the atherosclerotic plaque, until now there has been no direct evidence for a role of mitogens in the development of arterial lesions. Balloon catheter injury of the rat carotid artery is accompanied by death of medial SMCs and is typically followed by proliferation of SMCs with subsequent formation of an intimal lesion. Our hypothesis is that injury causes mitogens to be released from dead cells, which then stimulate cell proliferation. One such mitogen that may be important in this process is basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which can be detected immunocytochemically in SMCs and endothelial cells of adult rat carotid arteries. Systemic injection of a neutralizing antibody against bFGF prior to balloon catheterization significantly decreased the induced SMC proliferation by approximately 80%. The intimal lesion that developed within 8 days after injury, however, was not significantly reduced. The results of this study support the concept that endogenous bFGF is the major mitogen controlling the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells following injury. These data may have implications for the observed failure of endarterectomy and angioplasty procedures.\r"

Only medium from incubated integument contained ecdysteroids. The following evidence indicated that epidermal cells are the source of ecdysone: (i) when dorsal and/or ventral integuments were incubated separately, both produced ecdysteroid immunoreactive material during the course of incubation. As compared with the ecdysteroid content in the integument before incubation, the amount of ecdysteroids produced after a 24-h incubation increased 4- to 7-fold; (ii) enzymatic hydrolysis showed that neither highly polar ecdysteroid conjugates nor apolar conjugates were stored in the integument; (iii) histological and scanning electron microscope observations demonstrated that these excised integuments consisted of newly deposited epicuticle and epidermis as well as some fat body cells; (iv) HPLC RIA showed that the integument with associated fat body produced ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone, while the integument produced only ecdysone after removing fat body. Presumably, ecdysone secreted by epidermis was converted into 20-hydroxyecdysone by fat body.\r"

  ".U": "91219449\r", 
  ".W": "Although the A and B subtypes of Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) both result from the deficient activity of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; sphingomyelin cholinephosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.12) and the lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin, they have remarkably distinct phenotypes. Type A disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder of infancy, whereas type B disease has no neurologic manifestations and is characterized primarily by reticuloendothelial involvement and survival into adulthood. Both disorders are more frequent among individual of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry than in the general population. The recent isolation and characterization of cDNA and genomic sequences encoding ASM has facilitated investigation of the molecular lesions causing the NPD subtypes. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed, and the ASM cDNA from an Ashkenazi Jewish type A patient was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Molecular analysis of the PCR products revealed a G----T transversion of nucleotide 1487, which occurred at a CpG dinucleotide and predicted an Arg----Leu substitution in residue 496. Hybridization of PCR-amplified genomic DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotides indicated that the proband was homoallelic for the Arg----Leu substitution and that both parents and several other relatives were heterozygous. This mutation was detected in 32% (10 of 31) of the Ashkenazi Jewish NPD type A alleles studied and occurred in only 5.6% (2 of 36) of ASM alleles from non-Jewish type A patients. Of interest, the Arg----Leu substitution occurred in one of the ASM alleles from the two Ashkenazi Jewish NPD type B patients studied and in none of the ASM alleles of 15 non-Jewish type B patients. In contrast, the mutation was not present in 180 ASM alleles from normal individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. These findings identify a frequent missense mutation among NPD patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry that results in neuronopathic type A disease when homoallelic and can result in the nonneuronopathic type B phenotype when heteroallelic. The identification of this ASM mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish patients should facilitate the prevention of NPD in this population by carrier detection with molecular diagnostic techniques.\r"

The human DNA inserts in the YACs have a size between 60 and 1300 kbp and were isolated from two EcoRI partial digest libraries. The gaps between DRA and DRB, DRB and DQA, and DOB and DPA, which had not been cloned by other means, have been bridged with YAC clones. The contig extends through the 400 kpb of DNA between the DRA and C4 genes, thus linking the class II region with the complement gene cluster in the class III region. The cloning in YACs has been supported by a conventional cosmid walk of 290 kbp in the C4-DRA region. Restriction enzyme sites in the YAC clones were compared to the sites in the cosmid walk, to published cosmid clones, and to the already existing physical maps, leading to a detailed characterization of a region of the human genome over 1500 kbp. The YAC clones will be valuable for functional analysis of the MHC.\r"

To analyze the biochemical reactions involved in preassembly of this structure, a human hematopoietic cell-free system was employed. Incubation of cell extracts with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc and butanol partitioning of reaction mixtures yielded two products similar in TLC mobility to intermediates described in Trypanosoma brucei. Both species were sensitive to Bacillus thuringiensis phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, indicative of association of [3H]GlcNAc label with a plasmanylinositol-containing acceptor. In contrast to trypanosome intermediates, which contain phosphatidylinositol (1,2-diacylglycerophosphoinositol), however, alkali treatment and phospholipase A2 digestion generated butanol-phase products characteristic of glycosylated plasmanylinositol (1-alkyl-2-acylglycerophosphoinositol). Kinetic and pulse-chase experiments indicated that the slower-migrating species was a product of the faster and that it, but not the faster, was sensitive to both GPI-specific phospholipase D and nitrous acid deamination, consistent with conversion of GlcNAc- to GlcN-plasmanylinositol. Accordingly, acetic anhydride acetylation retransformed the slower species back to the faster. Further incubation with cell extracts converted the slower species into more polar products. Lysates of normal and of affected blood leukocytes from two paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) patients supported assembly of the two intermediates within 1 min. Thus, the initial enzymes mediating human GPI-anchor assembly are GlcNAc-plasmanylinositol transferase and GlcNAc-plasmanylinositol deacetylase, their substrates contain plasmanylinositols, and the products of their activities are normal in affected PNH cells.\r"

We have characterized the point mutation responsible for an AMH-negative PMDS in three siblings: a guanine to thymine transversion at position 2096 in the fifth exon changes a GAA triplet, coding for glutamic acid, to a TAA stop codon. The mutation could also be recognized, using the polymerase chain reaction, on RNA produced in trace amounts by a lymphoblastic cell line.

Cells expressing D1 receptor mRNA were localized to many, but not all, brain regions receiving dopaminergic innervation. The highest levels of hybridization were detected in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle. Cells expressing D1 receptor mRNA were also detected throughout the cerebral cortex, limbic system, hypothalamus, and thalamus. D1 receptor mRNA was differentially expressed in distinct regions of the hippocampal formation. Dentate granule cells were labeled in dorsal but not ventral regions, whereas the subicular complex was prominently labeled in ventral but not dorsal regions. Intermediate to high levels of D1 binding sites, but no hybridizing D1 receptor mRNA, were detected in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus, and subthalamic nucleus. In these brain regions, which are involved in the efferent flow of information from the basal ganglia, D1 receptors may be localized on afferent nerve terminals originating in other brain regions. These results indicate that in addition to a role in control of motor function, the D1 receptor may also participate in the cognitive, affective, and neuroendocrine effects of dopaminergic neurotransmission.\r"

We tested this assumption by recording activity from the optic nerves of intact goldfish (Carassius auratus) before and after intraocular injection of APB. Whole-nerve responses to increments and decrements of light were compared to electroretinogram responses and to tectal evoked potentials. APB severely reduced the amplitude of the electroretinogram b-wave but left ON and OFF responses from the optic nerve and tectum intact, although decreased in sensitivity. We conclude that APB does not completely eliminate ON responses in the visual system, at least in goldfish. The selectivity and effectiveness of APB must be evaluated in other species before this agent can be relied upon as a useful tool in understanding the roles of ON and OFF pathways in visual function.\r"

In addition, there were several instances in which transcription was detected (e.g., for HNF-1) when no mRNA or specific DNA binding protein was found, suggesting the importance of posttranscriptional control in some instances for these factors.

Lamin B interaction was significantly decreased upon in vitro phosphorylation of either lamin B or plectin with protein kinase A or C. In contrast, phosphorylation of plectin with kinase A increased its binding to vimentin, suggesting a different regulation of plectin interactions by this kinase. 32P-radiolabeling of rat glioma C6 cells revealed plectin as a major in vivo target of protein kinase A and protein kinase C. Plectin, present in lysates of dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-treated cells, showed a 2.5 times higher binding affinity to vimentin than plectin from phorbol ester-treated cells. Furthermore, the relative amounts of plectin in 1% Triton X-100/high salt-insoluble cell fractions decreased to one-fourth of control values upon treating cells with phorbol esters, whereas vimentin was unaffected. This finding suggested a protein kinase C-dependent weakening of plectin interaction with intermediate filaments in vivo. Taken together, these results point to a role of plectin in interlinking cytoskeletal and nuclear elements and suggest that specific protein kinases are involved in regulating these interactions.\r"

TP-1 is a type I interferon (IFN) and is most related to IFN-omega. Here we have determined if TP-1 genes are regulated similarly to other type I IFNs. Single day 18 bovine conceptuses secrete approximately 10(5) units of IFN antiviral activity per hour in culture, amounts approximately 300 times higher than those produced by Sendai virus-induced leukocytes. Although conceptuses express mRNA for IFN-alpha, IFN-omega, and TP-1, TP-1 constitutes greater than 99% of the IFN produced. In contrast, leukocytes produced predominantly IFN-alpha, although TP-1 mRNA is inducible by Sendai virus to very low levels. TP-1 mRNA is detectable by Northern analysis in conceptuses from early pregnancy but is absent in late gestation placenta and several adult tissues. Transfected bovine TP-1 genes are expressed in human choriocarcinoma (JAR) cells in the absence of any specific stimulus, whereas these cells do not secrete antiviral activity constitutively or after transfection with a bovine IFN-omega gene. The transfected TP-1 gene is not expressed in nontrophoblast cells (mouse L929 and hamster Chinese hamster ovary), however. The 5' promoter region of the TP-1 gene is sufficient to direct trophoblast-specific expression onto a human growth hormone reporter gene in JAR cells. Deletion of the promoter from -450 to -126 results in a 4- to 5-fold decrease in expression. Together these data demonstrate that the genes for TP-1 are inducible by virus but are expressed preferentially in trophoblast cells and are functionally distinct from IFN-omega genes.\r"

  ".W": "Myogenin belongs to a family of regulatory factors that can activate myogenesis when transfected into nonmyogenic cells. A conserved DNA sequence, known as an E box, serves as the target for binding and trans-activation by myogenin. Using 10T1/2 fibroblasts that constitutively express a transfected myogenin cDNA, we show that myogenin accumulates in the nucleus but is unable to initiate myogenesis when cells are maintained with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) or high serum. Although the final effect of TGF-beta and high serum--inhibition of myogenesis--was the same, their effects on the DNA-binding properties of myogenin in vitro differed. TGF-beta did not affect the ability of myogenin to bind DNA, whereas serum diminished the in vitro DNA-binding activity of myogenin. The helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein Id, postulated to inhibit DNA binding of other HLH proteins, was induced by high serum but not by TGF-beta. The presence of Id correlated with the failure of myogenin to bind the muscle creatine kinase enhancer in vitro. These findings suggest that serum can inhibit myogenesis by attenuating the DNA-binding activity of myogenin, possibly as a consequence of Id protein expression, whereas TGF-beta acts through a mechanism distal to DNA sequence recognition by myogenin and independent of Id.\r"

A cDNA clone of P3450 was transfected into mutant UV5 cells, which is defective in nucleotide excision repair. Expression of the P3450 cDNA was measured using 9000 x g supernatant (S9) fractions from CHO cells to evaluate Salmonella TA1538 mutagenicity with the mutagen 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ). The P3450-expressing clone UV5P3 was reverted to repair proficiency using ethyl methanesulfonate to obtain the UV-resistant clone 5P3R2, which maintained the same level of P3450 protein activity as UV5P3. These genetically similar cell lines were compared for toxicity and mutation induction at the aprt locus. With 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (the most prevalent mutagen found in fried beef) the differential sensitivity due to repair deficiency/proficiency was approximately 40-fold, and with IQ there were smaller, but significant, differences in sensitivity. These genotoxic effects occurred at doses that were approximately 10 times lower than those that previously gave similar effects in S9-mediated assays. Thus, these cell lines should be valuable for genotoxicity analysis as well as important for assessing DNA repair when evaluating compounds that undergo metabolic activation.\r"

The role of the zeta subunit in human Fc gamma RIIIA assembly differs from its role in T-cell receptor/CD3 complex assembly. The transmembrane domain of the Fc gamma RIIIA alpha subunit forms noncovalent interactions with the comparable domain of the zeta subunit and is sufficient for surface expression of the Fc gamma RIIIA complex. In the absence of these interactions, sequences in the transmembrane domain of the Fc gamma RIIIA alpha subunit signal its degradation. Leu-46, present in the transmembrane domain of the human zeta subunit, is important for assembly with the Fc gamma RIIIA alpha subunit. Substitution of this leucine with an isoleucine, as found in the mouse zeta subunit, significantly reduces this interaction. In contrast, the mouse and human zeta subunits interact with the pentameric T-cell receptor/CD3 complex, resulting in surface expression of this receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) consists of an antigen-binding heterodimer, termed Ti, which is noncovalently associated with the invariant CD3 subunits (gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, and eta). The CD3 zeta and -eta subunits form either homodimeric or heterodimeric structures in turn associated with the other components of the TCR complex. This feature increases the structural complexity of TCRs by creating \"isoforms.\" Both CD3 zeta and -eta are thought to play an important role in signal transduction triggered by antigen/major histocompatibility complex. To compare signaling functions of TCR isoforms, MA5.8, a CD3 zeta-eta- variant of the cytochrome c-specific, I-Ek-restricted T-cell hybridoma 2B4.11, was stably transfected with cDNAs encoding CD3 zeta and/or CD3 eta, and resulting clones were characterized. The findings indicate that signals inducing Ca2+ mobilization, phosphatidylinositol turnover, and interleukin 2 production are each transmitted by the above TCR isoforms. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD3 zeta subunit but not the CD3 eta subunit follows TCR stimulation. Given the general importance of tyrosine phosphorylation for receptor signaling, it is likely that this difference between TCR isoforms plays a regulatory role in T-lineage function by qualitatively or quantitatively altering signaling events.\r"

  ".W": "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p) was found in 27 of 52 (52%) previously untreated primary breast cancers. There was a significant correlation between this 17p allelic loss and two parameters associated with aggressive tumor behavior: high cellular proliferative fraction and DNA aneuploidy. These correlations with high cellular proliferative fraction and DNA aneuploidy were not found in tumors with LOH at nine other chromosome locations. The p53 gene, a putative tumor suppressor gene located at 17p13, was examined for aberrations to determine whether it is the target for the 17p LOH in breast cancer. Unlike other types of human cancer, there were no homozygous deletions or rearrangements of the p53 gene, and only 2 of 13 (15%) were mutated in the conserved region where mutational \"hot spots\" have been previously located. Therefore, we hypothesize that, in breast cancer, either loss or inactivation of gene(s) on chromosome 17p other than the p53 gene or a different mechanism of p53 gene inactivation may be responsible for the observed high labeling index and DNA aneuploidy associated with LOH at 17p.\r"

Whether enteric virus spreads from the intestinal tract to the central nervous system through nerves or through the bloodstream was examined using a serotype 3 reovirus strain. After peroral inoculation of newborn mice with reovirus, serial histologic sections of small intestine, brain and spinal cord were prepared and stained by immunoperoxidase to detect viral antigen. Three days after inoculation, viral antigen was observed in mononuclear cells of ileal Peyer's patches and in neurons of the adjacent myenteric plexus. Infection first appeared in the central nervous system 1-2 days later in neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Endothelial cells, meninges, choroid plexus, hypothalamus, and area postrema were not infected, indicating neural rather than bloodborne spread from the intestine. Staining of neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve depended on the route of virus inoculation and was independent of the amount of virus in the bloodstream. These results demonstrate that an enteric virus entering a host from the intestinal lumen can spread to the central nervous system through nerve fiber innervating the intestine.\r"

Severe (type III) vWD is autosomal recessive in inheritance and is associated with extremely low or undetectable vWF levels. We report a method designed to distinguish mRNA expression from the two vWF alleles by PCR analysis of peripheral blood platelet RNA using DNA sequence polymorphisms located within exons of the vWF gene. This approach was applied to a severe-vWD pedigree in which three of eight siblings are affected and the parents and additional siblings are clinically normal. Each parent was shown to carry a vWF allele that is silent at the mRNA level. Family members inheriting both abnormal alleles are affected with severe vWD, whereas individuals with only one abnormal allele are asymptomatic. The maternal and paternal silent alleles are identical at two coding sequence polymorphisms as well as an intron 40 variable number tandem repeat, suggesting a possible common origin. Given the frequencies of the two exon polymorphisms reported here, this analysis should be applicable to approximately 70% of type I and type III vWD patients. This comparative DNA and RNA PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism approach may also prove useful in identifying defects at the level of gene expression associated with other genetic disorders.\r"

Since the synthesis of Ter protein was observed to be down-regulated in vivo, these results are consistent with autoregulation as one control mechanism of Ter protein within the cell. Analysis of the tus gene that encodes the Ter protein revealed that transcription was initiated from a single promoter located within the upstream nontranscribed sequence. In vitro footprinting experiments have revealed that Ter protein prevented binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter sequence when both proteins were incubated with promoter DNA. However, once bound to the promoter, RNA polymerase could not be displaced by Ter protein. Conversely, prebound Ter protein could not be dislodged from its binding site at the promoter when challenged with RNA polymerase. Therefore, Ter protein can serve as a transcriptional repressor of its own synthesis by preventing RNA polymerase from binding to the tus promoter when both proteins are present in the cell milieu.\r"

These changes were sufficient to cause the mutant tRNAs to be aminoacylated by the corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases based on the amino acid inserted into protein from complementary initiation codons. Construction of additional single base anticodon variants (GUU, GGU, GCC, GUC, GCA, and UAA) showed that all three anticodon bases specify isoleucine and phenylalanine identity and that both the middle and the third anticodon bases are important for valine identity in vivo.\r"

When shifted to the restrictive temperature, these strains showed altered DNA synthesis and reduced ability to synthesize high molecular weight DNA products, thus providing in vivo evidence for the essential role of DNA primase in eukaryotic DNA replication.

  ".W": "Rat c-erbA beta 1 mRNA rises in cerebrum during the first 10 days of life, coincident with an increase in tissue triiodothyronine (T3) levels and T3-dependent brain development. These data suggest that the beta 1 receptor may mediate the T3 effect. However, in cerebellum c-erbA beta 1 mRNA levels were very low. Since cerebellar development, including dendritic arborization of Purkinje cells, is a T3-sensitive process, we assessed the levels of the beta 1 receptor protein in cerebellum during development. Antisera to unique peptide regions of beta 1 were raised. Their specificity was demonstrated by specific immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translated product, 85% immunoprecipitation of the T3 binding activity in hepatic nuclear extracts, and Western blot analysis of tissue extracts. Immunohistochemical studies using anti-beta 1 antiserum stained liver nuclei but not testis nuclei, which contain no T3 binding activity or beta 1 mRNA. In cerebellar Purkinje cells, an immunofluorescent signal, localized to the nucleus and more intense than that seen in the liver, was observed. A positive but weaker signal was also present in the granule cells. Thus, we may infer that the cerebellum contains significant concentrations of beta 1 receptor protein despite the low beta 1 mRNA content. Both the intensity of staining in Purkinje cell nuclei and immunoprecipitable beta 1 receptor binding capacity rose in the neonatal period. Antiserum to the non-T3 binding alpha 2 variant protein was also prepared and a distinctive pattern of fluorescence was observed. Strong fluorescence was seen in the nuclei of granule cells, but none was seen in Purkinje cells. The alpha 2 fluorescence in testis was high, consistent with the high levels of alpha 2 mRNA in this tissue. The fluorescent signal appeared to originate primarily in dividing spermatogonia. Our findings support the concept that the beta 1 receptor plays a central role in T3-induced brain development and strongly suggest that the Purkinje cell is a direct target for T3.\r"

  ".W": "Developing sympathetic neurons established in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) die in vitro after acute withdrawal of NGF. This in vitro model mimics the physiological situation in which neurons die during development or after axotomy when trophic support becomes insufficient. We have previously shown that depolarizing agents including high K+ and cholinergic agonists prevent neuronal death induced by acute deprivation of NGF in vitro. Based on this finding, a Ca2+ set-point hypothesis was proposed for the degree of neuronal dependence on tropic factor in vitro. Here we have examined the validity of this hypothesis by measuring the level of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) with fura-2 as a probe for monitoring Ca2+. (i) There was a good correlation between cell survival in the absence of NGF and [Ca2+]i levels of young sympathetic neurons (1 week in vitro) chronically exposed to various concentrations of extracellular K+, which shows that 50% survival occurred at approximately 184 nM [Ca2+]i and complete survival, independent of trophic support, occurred at approximately 240 nM [Ca2+]i. (ii) The basal level of [Ca2+]i of sympathetic neurons was relatively low (93.0 +/- 10.5 nM) at days 6-8, then increased with incubation time, and finally reached a plateau level of 241 +/- 7 nM at around week 3, when the neurons became independent of NGF for survival. (iii) Sympathetic neurons maintained in the presence of high or low concentrations of Ca2+ displayed altered trophic dependence. Thus, these findings are consistent with this Ca2+ set-point hypothesis for the degree of NGF dependence of sympathetic neurons for survival in vitro.\r"

Incorporating these currents into a model that includes delayed rectifier K+ channels and ATP-sensitive K+ channels, we show that only abnormal bursting is obtained. Modification of activation parameters to increase Ca2+ channel open times, as suggested by experiment, yields a more robust bursting similar to that observed in intact islets. This reinforces the suggestion that in addition to ATP-sensitive K+ channels, Ca2+ channels may serve as glucose sensors in the beta cell.\r"

The subcutaneous administration of EGF to newborn NBR rats for 10 days resulted in decreased body weight and fat pad weight that occurred in a dose-dependent fashion. At a dose of 1 micrograms/g of body weight, injected EGF resulted in a 50% decrease of fat pad weight. Although kidney weight was also diminished, the weight of other organs such as liver and intestine remained unchanged or even slightly increased, suggesting that the effect of EGF on fat pad development was not due to a generalized inhibitory action of EGF on the development of the neonate rats. The number of adipocyte precursors in inguinal fat pads of EGF-treated animals was higher than in control animals (1.3-fold for 0.3 micrograms/g of body weight of EGF and 1.8-fold for 1.0 micrograms/g of body weight), whereas the number of mature adipocytes and the amount of triglyceride accumulated per fat pad were concomitantly lower. Adipocyte precursors isolated from EGF-treated animals displayed a reduced differentiation ability in culture and a higher sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of EGF than did cells isolated from control animals. These experiments demonstrate that EGF can retard adipose tissue development in vivo and suggest that EGF plays an important physiological role in the control of adipocyte differentiation.\r"

Fusion of haploids that differ at both a and b results in production of a filamentous dikaryon, which induces tumors in its host, maize. Here I describe identification of genes distinct from a and b that play roles in these life-cycle transitions. These studies identify three genes, fuz1, fuz2, and rtf1, that are necessary for filament formation. fuz1 is also necessary for normal size and distribution of tumors and for teliospore formation; fuz2 is also necessary for teliospore germination. Mutations in the rtf1 gene, which are recessive, bypass the requirement of different b alleles for tumor formation. This observation indicates that rtf1 codes for a negative regulator of tumor induction. The fuz1, fuz2, and rtf1 genes may be targets for the a and b loci.\r"

In situ hybridization to mRNA is ideally suited to assess gene expression in all tissues but probe preparation presents major difficulties for adapting the technique for rapid screening. Here, we present a procedure to easily generate strand-specific DNA probes for in situ hybridization. In this method, a DNA fragment to be tested in uniformly labeled, denatured, and prehybridized to an excess of competitor single-stranded DNA corresponding to either positive or negative strands of the test fragment. No sequence information is needed. The prehybridized mixture is used directly for hybridization to whole embryo or tissue sections. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for any nonrepetitive fragment by using cDNA probes, intronless genomic probes, or genomic probes comprising transcribed and nontranscribed DNA. As an example, we show that mRNA for the recombination-activating genes (RAG) RAG-1 and RAG-2 is found in thymus of dE16 mouse embryos. Within the thymus, high levels of expression of RAG-1 and RAG-2 are detectable in the cortex but not in the medullary region. This supports the view that RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression is associated with cells known to actively rearrange antigen receptor loci.\r"

Thus, the enormous diversity of K+ channels in mammals can be generated not just through gene duplication and divergence but also through alternative splicing of RNA.\r"

Sequence analysis of the cloned gene revealed some remarkable properties for its expressed product, including a high lysine content (29%), a correspondingly high pI, and significant homology to the H1 class of eukaryotic histones. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody to this chlamydial histone analog, termed Hc1, displayed immunoblot and antinuclear specificity suggestive of cross-reactivity to H1 histones. The gene was expressed only during the late stages of the chlamydial life cycle concomitant with the reorganization of chlamydial reticulate bodies into elementary bodies, suggesting that the Hc1 protein plays a role in the condensation of chlamydial chromatin during intracellular differentiation.\r"

These transcripts initiate from one of two promoters, Cp or Wp, that function in a mutually exclusive fashion. Wp is exclusively utilized during the initial stages of infection of primary B lymphocytes, followed by a switch to Cp usage. These studies have been extended to show that (i) a mutant EBV strain lacking the gene encoding EBNA 2 fails to switch from Wp to Cp usage in primary B lymphocytes, although the virus contains a functional Cp; (ii) a region from -429 to -245 base pairs upstream of Cp is essential for Cp activity in B lymphocytes, but only in the context of upstream and downstream sequences; (iii) this region contains an EBNA 2-dependent enhancer; and (iv) DNase I protection employing nuclear extracts from B and T lymphocytes revealed a B-cell-specific footprint in the region of the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer. These results support a model for viral promoter switching during the initial stages of infection in which Wp activity leads to the expression of EBNA 2, followed by activation of Cp through the EBNA 2-dependent enhancer.\r"

  ".U": "91219490\r", 
  ".W": "Extracts of the bovine tracheal mucosa have an abundant peptide with potent antimicrobial activity. The 38-amino acid peptide, which we have named tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP), was isolated by a sequential use of size-exclusion, ion-exchange, and reverse-phase chromatographic fractionations using antimicrobial activity as a functional assay. The yield was approximately 2 micrograms/g of wet mucosa. The complete peptide sequence was determined by a combination of peptide and cDNA analysis. The amino acid sequence of TAP is H-Asn-Pro-Val-Ser-Cys-Val-Arg-Asn-Lys-Gly-Ile-Cys-Val-Pro-Ile-Arg-Cys-Pr o- Gly-Ser-Met-Lys-Gln-Ile-Gly-Thr-Cys-Val-Gly-Arg-Ala-Val-Lys-Cys-Cys-Arg- Lys-Lys - OH. Mass spectral analysis of the isolated peptide was consistent with this sequence and indicated the participation of six cysteine residues in the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds. The size, basic charge, and presence of three intramolecular disulfide bonds is similar to, but clearly distinct from, the defensins, a well-characterized class of antimicrobial peptides from mammalian circulating phagocytic cells. The putative TAP precursor is predicted to be relatively small (64 amino acids), and the mature peptide resides at the extreme carboxyl terminus and is bracketed by a short putative propeptide region and an inframe stop codon. The mRNA encoding this peptide is more abundant in the respiratory mucosa than in whole lung tissue. The purified peptide had antibacterial activity in vitro against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, the peptide was active against Candida albicans, indicating a broad spectrum of activity. This peptide appears to be, based on structure and activity, a member of a group of cysteine-rich, cationic, antimicrobial peptides found in animals, insects, and plants. The isolation of TAP from the mammalian respiratory mucosa may provide insight into our understanding of host defense of this vital tissue.\r"

Although ligation of mIgM or mIgD results in rapid activation of a phospholipase C and a tyrosine kinase(s), these receptors have cytoplasmic tails of only three amino acid residues (Lys-Val-Lys), which seem ill suited for direct physical coupling with cytoplasmic signal transduction structures. In this report, we identify the alpha, beta, and gamma components of the mIgM-associated phosphoprotein complex, which may play a role in signal transduction. Proteolytic peptide mapping demonstrated that the IgM-alpha chain differs from Ig-beta and Ig-gamma. The chains were purified, and amino-terminal sequencing revealed identity with two previously cloned B-cell-specific genes. One component, IgM-alpha, is a product of the mb-1 gene, and the two additional components, Ig-beta and Ig-gamma, are products of the B29 gene. Immunoblotting analysis using rabbit antibodies prepared against predicted peptide sequences of each gene product confirmed the identification of these mIgM-associated proteins. The deduced sequence indicates that these receptor subunits lack inherent protein kinase domains but include common tyrosine-containing sequence motifs, which are likely sites of induced tyrosine phosphorylation.\r"

To investigate the role of the envelope glycoprotein and the capsid proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in determining the site of virus assembly, we analyzed virus maturation in a polarized monkey kidney cell line. A line of cells harboring the HIV-1 provirus (VERO-pFN) was found to differentiate into polarized epithelial cell monolayers upon reaching confluency. By electron microscopy, virus maturation was observed predominantly at the basolateral membranes of VERO-pFN cells. Analysis of HIV-1 proteins revealed that virtually all of glycoprotein gp120 and capsid protein p24 were found in the basolateral medium, while no HIV-1 proteins were detected apically. A recombinant vaccinia virus (VV) expressing the HIV-1 gag polyprotein (VVgag) was used to determine the site of release of HIV-1 core particles in polarized epithelial cells in the presence or absence of envelope glycoproteins. When cells were infected with VVgag in the absence of envelope proteins, similar amounts of the p24 capsid protein were released into virus particles at the apical or basolateral surface. In contrast, when cells were doubly infected with VVgag and a recombinant VV expressing the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (VVenv), 94% of p24 and all of gp120 were found to be associated with particles released into the basolateral medium. These results indicate that the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein directly influences the site of release of virus particles containing the gag protein, probably via a specific interaction between the envelope protein and the gag protein.\r"

An unusual carbohydrate-protein linkage, a single monosaccharide, fucose, covalently attached directly to threonine in the peptide, is described here. The glycan moiety and the site of modification have been identified with mass spectrometry and confirmed by carbohydrate composition analysis, Edman degradation, and one- and two-dimensional NMR studies.

Here we describe evidence for the presence of intracellular receptor proteins that bind activated PKC. Several proteins from the detergent-insoluble material of the particulate fraction bound PKC in the presence of phosphatidylserine and calcium; binding was further increased with the addition of diacylglycerol. Binding of PKC to two of these proteins was concentration-dependent, saturable, and specific, suggesting that these binding proteins are receptors for activated C-kinase, termed here \"RACKs.\" PKC binds to RACKs via a site on PKC distinct from the substrate binding site.

We mapped the epitopes recognized by 12 of these monoclonal antibodies; the epitopes are all within the COOH-terminal region of gp32. As shown by others, removal of the COOH terminus of gp32 abolishes the ability of the intact protein to bind to many T4 proteins involved in replication, recombination, repair, and late transcription. These results suggest that the COOH terminus of gp32 is a protein-binding domain. The COOH terminus is attached to a DNA-binding domain that includes a zinc finger. We propose a model in which the DNA-binding and protein-binding domains are used in T4 replication, recombination, repair, and late transcription. The COOH terminus of gp32 is very acidic and may form four negatively charged amphipathic alpha-helices, which could fold into a four-helix bundle when associated with other proteins. At least six of the monoclonal anti-gp32 antibodies bind to the COOH terminus of gp32 and to DNA. Similarities between the COOH terminus of gp32 and DNA are explored.\r"

The orientation of glucose as a substrate in the active site of the thermophilic enzyme was modeled to position the C-6 end of hexose toward His-101 in the substrate-binding pocket. The locations of Met-87, Thr-89, Val-134, and Glu-180, which contact the C-6-OH group of the substrate in the sorbitol-bound xylose isomerase from Arthrobacter [Collyer, C.A., Henrick, K. & Blow, D. M. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 212, 211-235], are equivalent to those of Trp-139, Thr-141, Val-186, and Glu-232 in the thermophilic enzyme. Replacement of Trp-139 with Phe reduced the Km and enhanced the kcat of the mutant thermophilic enzyme toward glucose, whereas this substitution reversed the effect toward xylose. Replacement of Val-186 with Thr also enhanced the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme toward glucose. Double mutants with replacements Trp-139----Phe/Val-186----Thr and Trp-139----Phe/Val-186----Ser had a higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for glucose than the wild-type enzyme of 5- and 2-fold, respectively. They also exhibited 1.5- and 3-fold higher catalytic efficiency for D-glucose than for D-xylose, respectively. These results provide evidence that alteration in substrate specificity of factitious thermophilic xylose isomerases can be achieved by designing reduced steric constraints and enhanced hydrogen-bonding capacity for glucose in the substrate-binding pocket of the active site.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has pleiotropic effects on a wide variety of cell types. In vitro studies have demonstrated that TNF has antiviral properties and is induced in response to viral infections. However, a role for TNF in the antiviral immune response of the host has yet to be demonstrated. Here we describe the construction of and studies using a recombinant vaccinia virus that encodes the gene for murine TNF-alpha. By comparing the replication of and immune responses elicited by the TNF-encoding virus to a similarly constructed control virus, we hoped to observe immunobiological effects of TNF in the host. The in vivo experiments with this recombinant virus demonstrate that the localized production of TNF-alpha during a viral infection leads to the rapid and efficient clearance of the virus in normal mice and attenuates the otherwise lethal pathogenicity of the virus in immunodeficient animals. This attenuation occurs early in the infection (by postinfection hour 24) and is not due to the enhancement of cellular or antibody responses by the vaccinia virus-encoded TNF. This evidence suggests that attenuation of the recombinant virus is due to a direct antiviral effect of TNF on cells at the site of infection. Therefore, these results support the suggestion that TNF produced by immune cells may be an important effector mechanism of viral clearance in vivo.\r"

We report the cloning and characterization of the MSA1 gene of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax. This gene, which we call Pv200, encodes a polypeptide of 1726 amino acids and displays features described for MSA1 genes of other species, such as signal peptide and anchoring sequences, conserved cysteine residues, number of potential N-glycosylation sites, and repeats consisting here of 23 glutamine residues in a row. When the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the MSA1 of P. vivax are compared to those of another human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, and to those of the rodent parasite Plasmodium yoelii, 10 regions of high amino acid similarity are observed despite the very different dG + dC contents of the corresponding genes. All of the interspecies conserved regions reside within the conserved or semiconserved blocks delimited by the sequences of different alleles of the MSA1 gene of P. falciparum.\r"

  ".W": "The location of biologically relevant epitopes on recombinant human beta interferon in which Ser-17 replaces Cys-17 (rh[Ser17]IFN-beta) was evaluated by testing the immunoreactivity of antibodies against 159 sequential, overlapping octamer peptides. Three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize rh[Ser17]IFN-beta biologic activity, designated A1, A5, and A7, bound to peptides spanning only residues 39-48, whereas nonneutralizing mAb bound less specifically at multiple sites near the amino terminus. The immunoreactivity of peptides spanning residues 40-47 that contained a series of single amino acid substitutions suggested that residues 41-43 (Pro-Glu-Glu) and 46 (Gln) are important for the binding of neutralizing mAbs. The reactivity of mAbs to larger synthetic peptides containing rh[Ser17]IFN-beta sequences from residue 32 through residue 56 was evaluated. All mAbs except A7 reacted with synthetic peptides representing rh[Ser17]IFN-beta residues 32-47, 40-56, and 32-56, but only mAbs A1 and A5 bound to the core peptide composed of residues 40-47. Peptide 32-56 effectively blocked the binding of mAbs A1 and A5 to rh[Ser17]IFN-beta and markedly inhibited their neutralizing activity. Biologic activity of the peptides was undetectable. Rabbit antisera raised against peptides 32-47 and 40-56 recognized rh[Ser17]IFN-beta but did not neutralize its antiviral activity. Thus, structure-function analysis by peptide mapping has permitted the identification of a linear epitope recognized by neutralizing antibody on a biologically active cytokine. We conclude that the region spanning residues 32-56 is of major importance in the expression of the biologic activity of human IFN-beta.\r"

Tat addition increases mRNA levels early in the viral life cycle, and Tat is required for Rev function to become evident. There is no evidence for a translational effect of Tat. Nuclear run-on experiments show that the increase in mRNA levels is due to an increased efficiency of elongation of nascent transcripts. These results suggest that Tat may be a gene-specific elongation factor.\r"

Insights into the ontogeny of Ca(2+)-signaling pathways were gained by investigating the developmental expression of granule cell-enriched Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase-Gr) in the cerebellum and hippocampus of the rat. Neurons of these brain regions displayed characteristic schedules by which they acquired and lost CaM kinase-Gr during differentiation. In the cerebellum, granule cells did not begin to express CaM kinase-Gr until after birth when they migrated into the granule cell layer, and this expression persisted in the adult. Purkinje cells expressed CaM kinase-Gr prenatally and lost this expression by postnatal day 14. In contrast, the granule and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus expressed the enzyme prenatally and in the adult. Moreover, CaM kinase-Gr was localized to the processes and nuclei of developing neurons. This subcellular localization together with the scheduled expression of CaM kinase-Gr can serve to regulate a developing neuron's sensitivity to Ca2+ at different subcellular levels.\r"

  ".W": "From highly purified elementary bodies (EBs) of Chlamydia trachomatis, we have identified a protein of 38 kDa that selectively binds to monolayer cultures of HeLa cells. This protein, which we have named the chlamydial cytadhesin (CCA), is present on the surface of the EBs of three C. trachomatis serovars (B, E, and L1) that were examined. Localization of the CCA at the surface was confirmed by its ability to be labeled when viable EBs were iodinated and by its absence in preparations from trypsin-treated EBs. Viable EBs, but not heated or trypsin-treated EBs, inhibited the binding of the CCA to HeLa cells, indicating competition for a common receptor on the host cell membrane. A dose-dependent inhibition of adherence of radioactive EBs to HeLa cells was effected by extracts containing the CCA. This inhibition occurred even with extracts prepared from the EB of heterologous serovars. However, no inhibition could be demonstrated with extracts prepared from heat-treated EBs. Heat treatment of the extract resulted in the loss of ability of the CCA to bind to the host cells. HeLa cells preincubated with CCA-containing chlamydial extract showed reduced ability to bind labeled EBs and to develop cytoplasmic inclusions after infection. This protective activity was lost after exposure of the extract to heat. These findings indicate that the CCA is a thermolabile surface-exposed chlamydial adhesin; it may be useful in the development of vaccines for diseases caused by the pathogenic bacterium.\r"

In developing nonionic compounds, Almen showed that it was possible to decrease the osmolality by a factor of 2 and also thereby reduce the chemotoxicity by as much as a factor of 20. Serious adverse side effects after the intravascular administration of contrast material are caused by a combination of osmotoxic and chemotoxic properties of an individual contrast media molecule as well as the ionic composition of the agent when in solution. Worldwide clinical experience with the use of LOCM, ionic and nonionic, consistently has shown the new material to be safer and more comfortable in clinical practice. Some form of limited use of LOCM is now part of virtually every radiologist's daily practice, and the focus is turning to the low-risk-no-risk group. There are gray areas between risk categories, with some evidence even suggesting that the 20- to 40-year-old age group may be at risk to the same or even a greater degree than other commonly accepted risk groups such as the elderly. The future promises even better and safer but, in all likelihood, expensive, contrast agents for intravascular use. The ultimate decision on choice of contrast or the fate of LOCM rests with public policy makers, organized medicine, and the individual physician and patient. Based on penetration of the marketplace (nearly 50%) in terms of LOCM sales in 1990, there is a growing awareness within our specialty as well as the public sector of the improvements offered by LOCM. It is unlikely that a major conversion back to the universal use of HOCM will ever occur. As long as cost remains the major focus of the debate over the choice, however, physicians need to be informed advocates, familiar with the science, yet sensitive to the economic implications of the decisions they make to best serve the interests of their patients.\r"

The detection and differential diagnosis of adrenal masses is a legitimate application of this technique. The staging of renal tumors in patients in whom CT fails to do so may be accomplished by MR imaging. Establishment of patency of the renal veins and of surgical shunts involving these veins may be performed by MR imaging if Doppler ultrasonography proves unsatisfactory. MR imaging may differentiate between stable retroperitoneal fibrosis and malignant disease in patients in whom this differential is a problem. Hematomas may be distinguished from nonhemorrhagic fluid collections anywhere in the abdomen or pelvis. In selected patients, the local extent of certain bladder tumors may be evaluated by MR imaging when CT and biopsy fail to do so. In testicular disease, MR imaging may aid in the differential diagnosis of abnormalities that are not sufficiently characterized by ultrasonography, and MR imaging may detect undescended testes in some patients in whom ultrasonography fails to do so. In the future, wider application of fast scanning with bolus administration of soluble paramagnetic contrast agents may refine the differential diagnosis of adrenal masses and aid in the detection of renal masses. MR angiographic techniques ultimately may constitute a screening procedure for renal arteriostenosis. A subset of patients with prostate carcinoma may prove to benefit from local staging of the disease by MR imaging.\r"

This classification has been extremely useful in expanding the number of patients treated conservatively. The following entities can be considered benign and require no further evaluation: the classic simple cyst (Bosniak category 1), a cyst with benign calcification (see Fig. 1A and B), a hyperdense cyst (see Fig. 2), and a cyst with thin (less than or equal to 1mm) septations (see Fig. 5A; Bosniak category 2). When any of the following features are present, further evaluation is warranted: aggressive calcifications (see Fig. 1C-E), abnormal density not fulfilling the criteria of a hyperdense cyst (see Figs. 3 and 4), or nodular septations (see Fig. 5B and C), or wall thickening (see Fig. 7; Bosniak) category 3). Small masses that cannot be characterized accurately also require further evaluation. Multiloculated masses(see Fig. 9) require surgery (Bosniak category 3). Most cases of multiple localized renal cysts can be distinguished from multiloculated masses and do not require surgery (see Fig. 10). Evaluation of cyst fluid by MR imaging has not been proved reliable in differentiating benign and malignant masses. MR imaging will become more useful when its spatial resolution equals that of CT. Masses that remain indeterminate after careful evaluation by ultrasonography and CT scanning can be evaluated additionally by angiography or cyst puncture. Management options for persistent enigmatic masses include follow-up radiologic studies, exploration, local excision, and nephrectomy.\r"

  ".U": "91219578\r", 
  ".W": "The most common curable cause of high blood pressure is renovascular hypertension. Although hypertension is common in the United States, only a minority, approximately 1%, of patients have a renovascular cause. Using clinical criteria, a subgroup of these patients can be selected in which the prevalence of renovascular hypertension will be approximately 15%. In these selected patients, it is appropriate to proceed to a radiographic screening modality to look for a significant renal artery stenosis. The choice of modality should reflect the strengths and expertise of each specific institution. Hypertensive urography is no longer recommended for screening. Excellent results have been reported with intravenous DSRA in institutions where a strong interest in this procedure exists. Furthermore, intravenous DSRA is easily coupled with the collection of renal vein samples for renin assay. Intravenous DSRA, however, has not maintained widespread use. Although the radionuclide renogram is no longer adequate as a radiographic screening tool, stimulation with an ACE inhibitor, such as captopril or enalaprilat, may produce excellent results. In many institutions, this is the most appropriate examination. Furthermore, it is relatively noninvasive. Merely detecting a significant renal artery stenosis does not, however, mean the patient has renovascular hypertension. Both hypertension and a renal artery stenosis may be present and not be causally related. Because renovascular hypertension is, at least initially, renin mediated, the demonstration of increased renin production by the ipsilateral kidney should confirm renovascular hypertension. Prospective application of these results to patients undergoing revascularization techniques, however, has been disappointing. This may be related to problems in patient preparation, sample collection, renin assay, or even the physiology of chronic hypertension, which is incompletely renin mediated. Thus, offering revascularization only to those patients with lateralizing renal vein renins is not appropriate. If radiographic screening is limited to those patient at greatest likelihood for a renovascular etiology, intra-arterial DSRA or conventional arteriography may be used. These techniques most reliably detect renal artery stenosis. Their main disadvantage lies in their relatively invasive nature, as an arterial puncture is required. The poor predictive value of selective RVRRs implies that revascularization may be attempted without awaiting those results. If percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty can be performed with a satisfactorily low complication rate, both the diagnostic and the interventional procedure may be undertaken at the same setting. It is expected that further refinements in these diagnostic procedures, particularly with the use of stimulating drugs such as ACE inhibitors, will lead to further improvement in the diagnostic results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

An improved data base has been developed for renal ultrasonography, permitting a more precise evaluation of hydronephrosis. Rigidity with regard to an algorithm for renal obstruction is not recommended because it would be fixed at a point in time and dependent upon the equipment and expertise of a given institution. In all likelihood ultrasonography will continue to be used as the primary screening tool. A role for the intravenous urogram remains, especially in the acute presentation of renal obstruction. It is interesting to note that the initial description of the percutaneous nephrostomy tube was as a diagnostic technique in patients who had long-standing ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Prediction of recoverability of the kidneys was not possible without relieving the obstruction and assessing the ability of the postobstructive kidney to function. Recoverability of renal function cannot be assessed on a short-term basis but takes time. Up to 8 weeks is necessary before the kidney has established its new baseline level of function. The percutaneous nephrostomy has become an integral tool for the interventional radiologist and is used in treatment. Indeed, its treatment role is important, and even today we must be careful not to assess the kidneys' functional status after placement of the nephrostomy tube without allowing the renal unit sufficient time for recovery. The future undoubtedly will bring further tremendous changes in our assessment of renal obstruction. It is important that radiologists position themselves at the forefront of these developments.\r"

  ".W": "For patients with prostate cancer, diagnostic imaging can play three roles: screening, staging, and monitoring. Bayesian analysis dictates that if the prior probability of cancer is relatively low or if the consequences of a false-positive result are unacceptable, the test must be optimally specific. If the prior probability of cancer is high or if the consequences of missing it are unacceptable, the test must be optimally sensitive. For screening, the consequences of a miss are slight, and the consequences of labeling an insignificant cancer significant are serious. Thus, a very specific test is required. No current imaging modality fulfills this criterion. For staging, the prior probability of significant disease is relatively high, and the consequences of a miss serious, so a very sensitive test is required. Transrectal sonography, plus biopsy under sonographic control, fulfills this criterion for local disease, as does a bone scan for bone metastases. For monitoring, the prior probability is high, and the consequences of a miss serious, so a very sensitive test is needed. The bone scan is sensitive for bone metastases. Although CT is not sensitive for detecting lymph node metastases, it has practical clinical advantages over other imaging modalities for monitoring purposes in that it can detect disease in multiple structures at once. It is the only test that can monitor prostate size, the size of the lymph nodes, and whether hydronephrosis or liver metastases are present all in the scope of one examination.\r"

  ".W": "Prostatic urethroplasty with a balloon catheter is an easy procedure to perform, but certain guidelines must be followed to avoid complications. This procedure will reduce the overall treatment cost of benign prostatic hyperplasia significantly. Preliminary results range from 70% to 85% symptomatic improvement or resolution of the prostatism symptoms. Its recurrence rate is still not known, but a small one is expected. Nevertheless, because of the noninvasiveness, low cost, and simplicity of the procedure, it potentially could be repeated, if necessary. This procedure is one that when it is done in combination with another specialist, in this case a urologist, the patient will benefit by the use of the expertise of both the urologist's knowledge of the disease of the urinary system and the interventional radiologist's skills with catheters and guide wires.\r"

Increasingly, sonography is the initial diagnostic tool, obviously the only one usable in utero. The VCUG is the next most important method, especially in working out the often confusing sonographic images of the upper urinary tracts. Nuclear medicine remains drastically underused; it is the best way to detect parenchymal inflammatory disease and offers a method of examination and follow-up that requires low dosages and allows quantification of data. It will be interesting 10 years from now to review this subject and see what remains of the old and current methods and what will emerge.\r"

  ".U": "91219587\r", 
  ".W": "The association of clinically apparent varicoceles with male subfertility and infertility has been noted in the urology literature since the late nineteenth century, and surgical ligation of varicoceles has been considered appropriate therapy in an attempt to improve semen quality and increase fertility for the past 40 years. It has been established by several authors cited herein that varicocele size does not predict prognosis after ligation reliably. Because subclinical varicoceles may affect testicular function and histologic characteristics adversely and because age at time of therapy may affect probability of successful enhancement of fertility, the interest of radiologists and urologists has been directed toward diagnosis and treatment of both clinically obvious and clinically occult varicoceles, particularly in young adult men or adolescent boys. Testicular growth after varicocele ligation in adolescent boys also suggests a benefit from early intervention. Sonographic evidence of a varicocele must be correlated with analysis of semen for sperm density, motility, and morphology, as not all patients with varicoceles are infertile. Although surgical therapy is standard for varicocele occlusion, fairly extensive evidence exists to show that percutaneous transvenous occlusion of varicoceles is feasible, safe, and effective, particularly in the setting of varicocele recurrence after conventional surgical treatment.\r"

With the aid of mechanistic and synthetic chemistry, the vast network of molecules and cells of the immune system has been tapped to produce antibodies with a new function--catalytic antibodies. Because antibodies can be generated that selectively bind almost any molecule of interest, this new technology offers the potential to tailor-make highly selective catalysts for applications in biology, chemistry, and medicine. In addition, catalytic antibodies provide fundamental insight into important aspects of biological catalysis, including the importance of transition-state stabilization, proximity effects, general acid and base catalysts, electrophilic and nucleophilic catalysis, and strain.\r"

  ".U": "91220064\r", 
  ".W": "Src homology (SH) regions 2 and 3 are noncatalytic domains that are conserved among a series of cytoplasmic signaling proteins regulated by receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, including phospholipase C-gamma, Ras GTPase (guanosine triphosphatase)-activating protein, and Src-like tyrosine kinases. The SH2 domains of these signaling proteins bind tyrosine phosphorylated polypeptides, implicated in normal signaling and cellular transformation. Tyrosine phosphorylation acts as a switch to induce the binding of SH2 domains, thereby mediating the formation of heteromeric protein complexes at or near the plasma membrane. The formation of these complexes is likely to control the activation of signal transduction pathways by tyrosine kinases. The SH3 domain is a distinct motif that, together with SH2, may modulate interactions with the cytoskeleton and membrane. Some signaling and transforming proteins contain SH2 and SH3 domains unattached to any known catalytic element. These noncatalytic proteins may serve as adaptors to link tyrosine kinases to specific target proteins. These observations suggest that SH2 and SH3 domains participate in the control of intracellular responses to growth factor stimulation.\r"

Each repeated unit is designated a module, and two modules are contained in a single open reading frame. A model for the synthesis of this complex polyketide is proposed, where each module encodes a functional synthase unit and each synthase unit participates specifically in one of the six FAS-like elongation steps required for formation of the polyketide. In addition, genetic organization and biochemical order of events appear to be colinear. Evidence for the model is provided by construction of a selected mutant and by isolation of a polyketide of predicted structure.\r"

The alterations included ten point mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions, and one 24-base pair deletion. In all but one case, the mutations were associated with chromosome 17p allelic deletions, leaving the cells with only mutant forms of the p53 gene products. Through the use of the polymerase chain reaction and oligomer-specific hybridization, p53 mutations were identified in 1 to 7 percent of the cells within the urine sediment of each of three patients tested. The p53 mutations are the first genetic alterations demonstrated to occur in a high proportion of primary invasive bladder cancers. Detection of such mutations ex vivo has clinical implications for monitoring individuals whose tumor cells are shed extracorporeally.\r"

This domain is shared by a number of signal transduction proteins including nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as Abl, Fps, Src, and Src family members, the transforming protein Crk, phospholipase C-gamma 1, PI-3 (phosphatidylinositol) kinase, and guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (GAP). Like the SH2 domain found in Src, Crk, and Abl, the SH2 domain of tensin bound specifically to a number of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins from v-src-transformed cells. Tensin was also found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. These findings suggest that by possessing both actin-binding and phosphotyrosine-binding activities and being itself a target for tyrosine kinases, tensin may link signal transduction pathways with the cytoskeleton.\r"

  ".W": "In most clinical isolates that are resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins and related compounds, the mechanism of resistance is the production of beta-lactamase enzymes. These enzymes hydrolyze the amide bond in the beta-lactam ring of the compound, producing acidic derivatives that have no antibacterial properties. The rationale for beta-lactamase inhibitors is to overcome this resistance. Early study of beta-lactamase inhibition was begun in the 1940s without success. Interest in beta-lactamase inhibition was renewed with the development of the semisynthetic penicillins in the early 1960s, when it was found that certain of these compounds could function as inhibitors. However, none found clinical application. The screening of microorganisms for possible production of naturally occurring beta-lactamase inhibitors resulted in the discovery of the olivanic acids and, later, clavulanic acid. A formulation of clavulanic acid with amoxicillin was introduced in 1981, and a formulation of clavulanic acid with ticarcillin appeared shortly thereafter. More recently, other beta-lactamase inhibitors have been developed, including sulbactam and tazobactam. A formulation of sulbactam with ampicillin has appeared recently. As a result of beta-lactamase inhibition, amoxicillin and clavulanate and ticarcillin and clavulanate are active against a high proportion of amoxicillin resistant and ticarcillin resistant pathogens. These formulations have been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of many infections that would not be expected to respond to amoxicillin or ticarcillin alone.\r"

  ".W": "Bacterial skin infections occur commonly and range in severity from mild to life threatening. The severity of skin infections, and their management and prognosis, can depend on the mechanism of infection, the skin structures involved and the infecting organism or organisms. Primary skin infections result from invasion of microorganisms through tiny breaks in the epidermis or from the spread of microorganisms through the bloodstream. Secondary infections arise from pre-existing trauma, burns or surgical wounds; infections involving the soft tissues underlying the skin are also discussed. These also frequently occur in areas of trauma, operation or ischemia. The cause, bacteriologic factors and management of skin infections were studied, with special attention to pyodermas, infections of the foot in diabetic patients and necrotizing soft tissue infections. Choice of appropriate antibiotic agents depends in large part on the infecting organism and patterns of antibiotic susceptibility. In necrotizing soft tissue infections, survival or limb salvage may depend on prompt surgical intervention. In these instances and in some of advanced primary skin infections in which bacteremia is involved, parenteral antibiotics are required. The available options are discussed and a report on the data with the combination agent ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium is presented.\r"

  ".U": "91220267\r", 
  ".W": "Secondary bacterial peritonitis is usually a polymicrobial infection of facultative gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Treatment consists of operation and broad-spectrum antibiotic administration. The antibiotic treatment of choice in these infections has been the combination of gentamicin and clindamycin. However, this combination can have toxic side effects and necessitates frequent monitoring of serum levels. Beta-lactam antibiotics provide broad-spectrum coverage and low toxicity, but can be inactivated by species of bacteria producing beta-lactamase enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and has been shown to extend the efficacy of ticarcillin to bacteria producing these enzymes. This combination was compared with gentamicin and clindamycin in 99 consecutive patients with complicated appendicitis. Eradication of identified pathogens was greater in the ticarcillin and clavulanate group (98 per cent) than in the gentamicin and clindamycin group (92 per cent), even for the subgroup of organisms producing beta-lactamases (97 versus 90 per cent eradication). Complications and clinical response were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. Ticarcillin and clavulanic acid is a safe and effective alternative to gentamicin and clindamycin in the treatment of secondary bacterial peritonitis and offers advantages in dosing simplicity and freedom from ototoxic and nephrotoxic effects.\r"

  ".W": "Age is a major factor in determining the outcome for older patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. Poor outcome in these patients may be related to a number of physiologic and immunologic changes associated with aging. The treatment of intra-abdominal sepsis can itself pose special risks for the elderly. Standard regimens containing aminoglycosides have a substantial risk of nephrotoxicity, which is magnified in elderly patients. Alternatives to standard aminoglycoside-containing regimens, therefore, are desirable. Most intra-abdominal infections involve multiple pathogens, usually both aerobic and anaerobic. The polymicrobial nature of intra-abdominal sepsis mandates antimicrobial chemotherapy effective against a broad range of organisms. In the past several years, a host of new antibiotics have been introduced that used alone or in combination with other drugs has the potential of safely avoiding aminoglycosides in many patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. One such agent, ticarcillin with clavulanate potassium, is active against a wide spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. In a prospective, randomized, open label trial, ticarcillin and clavulanate was compared with gentamicin and clindamycin. Although the sample size was too small to allow meaningful statistical comparisons of efficacy and safety, both regimens were effective and well tolerated. In general, prolonged administration of aminoglycosides is rarely indicated for the treatment of intra-abdominal sepsis in the elderly, although initial empiric use of aminoglycosides may sometimes be warranted.\r"

One such alternative is Timentin (a combination agent of ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium). This agent has a more convenient dose schedule than standard therapy and eliminates the possibility of aminoglycoside ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is active in vitro against most pathogens associated with ruptured appendicitis in children. The preliminary results of an ongoing prospective, open label, randomized trial comparing ticarcillin and clavulanate with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin in childhood ruptured appendicitis are reported herein. While further evaluation is necessary, we have found single agent therapy with ticarcillin and clavulanate to be equivalent in safety and efficacy to standard combination therapy.

In response to the need for new forms of therapy for mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections, several new classes of antimicrobial agents have been introduced. Some of these allow for the potential option of monotherapy in certain clinical settings. In addition to clinical and microbiologic efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness are factors that must be addressed with regard to these agents.\r"

Problems include finding adequate samples of comparable patients, establishing objective criteria by which to assess outcomes and controlling for the effects of nonexperimental factors. These difficulties are among the reasons many comparative trials of antibiotic therapy for intra-abdominal infection fail to find a difference in efficacy between the experimental regimens. Those trials that do demonstrate a therapeutic difference usually compare an adequate regimen against one that is clearly deficient; for example, one that lacks coverage of anaerobic organisms. For hospital acquired or surgical infections, the treatment regimen with the most extensive published support is the combination of an aminoglycoside and clindamycin. Single agent therapy for intra-abdominal infections may also be appropriate. Further clinical studies are needed, but two of the most promising agents are ticarcillin and clavulanic acid and imipenem and cilastatin.\r"

All patients received an intravenous infusion of nicardipine for 72 hours, starting with a dose of 3 mg/hr and increasing to a maximum dose of 7 mg/hr. Upward titration of the dose was limited by a 10% decrease in blood pressure or a 20 beats/min increase in pulse. Intravenous therapy was followed by 30 days of oral therapy. The mean +/- SD interval from onset of stroke to commencement of therapy was 9.1 +/- 5.4 hours. Adverse reactions consisted primarily of hypotension requiring discontinuation of therapy in four patients. Score on a graded neurologic examination increased from 41/100 at baseline to 64/100 at 3 months for the 41 patients completing follow-up. There was no correlation between the dose of nicardipine administered and outcome, but the 11 patients starting therapy less than or equal to 6 hours after onset did better than those starting therapy 6-12 hours after onset. Further study of very early therapy with nicardipine is justified.\r"

The principal sclerotic change was fibrohyaline thickening of the wall, which began to appear during the late fourth decade, increased in incidence gradually with age, and was most severe in patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. Morphometry showed that the sclerotic changes of the medullary arteries were most prominent in the frontal lobe, followed by the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, in both the nonneuropsychiatric and demented groups. The sclerotic rate in the frontal lobe of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type was slightly higher than that in the nonneuropsychiatric patients (p less than 0.05) but far less than that in the patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (p less than 0.001).

Leukoaraiosis was graded from 0 to 4 on a semiquantitative scale; bicaudate, frontal horn, and posterior horn indices were used as measures of ventricular size. Patients with leukoaraiosis were older (difference between means 7 years, t = 5.3, df = 140, p less than 0.0001) and had larger bicaudate indices (difference between means 0.023, t = 3.54, df = 140, p = 0.0007) than patients without leukoaraiosis. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the effects of age and leukoaraiosis were independent. No effect of lesion type (cortical or lacunar infarct, or both) on bicaudate index could be demonstrated. Larger values for the bicaudate index were associated with a predominantly anterior location of leukoaraiosis.

Fifteen neurosurgical procedures in eight patients included eight clot evacuations, three abscess drainage procedures, two ventriculoperitoneal shunts, one biopsy, and one lobectomy. Recurrent postoperative cerebral hemorrhage was seen in four patients at 2 days, 9 days, 6 weeks, and 10 months, but surgery was thought to have precipitated the cerebral hemorrhage in only one patient. Recurrent cerebral hemorrhage also was seen in two of the eight nonoperated cases.

The results showed caprate (C10) to be the most potent vasorelaxant and basilar arteries to be more responsive (EC50 = 63 microM) than umbilical arteries (EC50 = 780 microM). Caprate also inhibited contractions elicited by KCl, serotonin, and the thromboxane analogue U46619. The relaxation was independent of the endothelium, and potency was not related to the weak capacity of caprate to inhibit Ca(2+)-induced contractions of K(+)-depolarized basilar arteries. The pattern of potencies for the arteries differed, but among unsaturated fatty acids the monounsaturated (C14:1, C18:1) were more potent than the polyunsaturated (C18:2, C18:3). Comparing the potencies obtained with the concentrations reported for the free fatty acid content of arteries, brain, and plasma indicates that these lipids could influence vasomotion in health and disease.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen radicals are known to be produced by the cerebral vasculature during acute, pressor-induced hypertension and are also known to inactivate endothelium-derived relaxing factor. The objective of our present study was to determine if the oxygen radical scavenger superoxide dismutase (24,000 units/kg plus 1,600 units/kg/min) alters the pressor, cerebral blood flow, and mortality responses to systemic norepinephrine in rats. Increasing doses (0.01-30 micrograms/kg i.v.) of norepinephrine were given by bolus injection to eight rats, and changes in the cortical microcirculatory blood flow were measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Superoxide dismutase shifted the norepinephrine-blood pressure and -cerebral blood flow dose-response curves moderately, but significantly, to the right such that it took more norepinephrine to reach a given blood pressure. However, superoxide dismutase had no effect on the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. Additionally, whereas five (63%) of the eight control rats died after the 10 micrograms/kg norepinephrine dose, all eight rats treated with superoxide dismutase survived this dose. The mechanism by which superoxide dismutase reduced mortality is uncertain. The blood pressure and cerebral blood flow results suggest that superoxide dismutase prevents oxygen radicals from destroying endothelium-derived relaxing factors, which reduce the pressor effects of norepinephrine.\r"

  ".W": "Using a rat model of stroke, we examined the effects of focal cerebral ischemia on the metabolism of polyphosphoinositides by injecting 32Pi into both the left and right cortices. After equilibration of the label for 2-3 hours, ischemia induced a significant decrease (p less than 0.001) in the concentrations of labeled phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphates (66-78%) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (64-67%) in the right middle cerebral artery cortex of four rats. The phospholipid labeling pattern in the left middle cerebral artery cortex, which sustained only mild ischemia and no permanent tissue damage, was not different from that of two sham-operated controls. However, when 32Pi was injected 1 hour after the ischemic insult, there was a significant decrease (p less than 0.01) in the incorporation of label into the phospholipids in both cortices of four ischemic rats compared with four sham-operated controls. Furthermore, differences in the phospholipid labeling pattern were observed in the left cortex compared with the sham-operated controls. The change in labeling pattern was attributed to the partial reduction in blood flow following ligation of the common carotid arteries. We provide a sensitive procedure for probing the effects of focal cerebral ischemia on the polyphosphoinositide signaling pathway in the brain, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of tissue injury.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative contribution of cellular hypertrophy versus cellular hyperplasia to this vessel change in a morphometric analysis as well as the functional properties of remodeled vessels in an in vitro study. We assessed cell number and vessel dimensions by morphometric analysis of 16 perfusion-fixed rabbit basilar arteries. Results demonstrated significant increases in luminal diameter from 761 to 946 microns (p less than 0.01), medial cross-sectional area from 5.1 x 10(4) to 7.6 x 10(4) micron2 (p less than 0.005), smooth muscle cell volume from 9.19 x 10(5) to 1.44 x 10(6) micron3 (p less than 0.0005), and overall arterial length from 17.41 to 20.36 mm (p less than 0.005) in basilar arteries from the eight ligated rabbits compared with the eight sham-operated controls. Smooth muscle cell volume fraction and cell numerical density were unchanged whereas the number of cells per unit length of artery was increased significantly from 21.5 to 31.0 cells/micron (p less than 0.05). These data indicate that smooth muscle cell hyperplasia rather than hypertrophy contributes to increases in vessel mass. Functional properties of the basilar arteries from 10 ligated and 10 normal control rabbits were analyzed in vitro. Results showed increased contraction to potassium chloride (approximately 74%) (p less than 0.01) and increased sensitivity of smooth muscle to acetylcholine (p less than 0.05) while maximal relaxation was the same as control in the ligated animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We quantified interruptions in the internal elastic lamina in certain arteries and studied the effect of beta-aminopropionitrile, an inhibitor of cross-link formation in collagen and elastic fibers, on rupture of the internal elastic lamina and on mortality in these two substrains. To eliminate any influence of higher blood pressure in the stroke-prone rats on the parameters studied, we used antihypertensive treatment to obtain equivalent blood pressures in the two substrains. Results showed that stroke sensitivity was associated with an enhanced early spontaneous rupture of the internal elastic lamina in the caudal artery, an increased susceptibility to beta-aminopropionitrile-induced rupture of the internal elastic lamina, and earlier mortality, mainly from aortic rupture, under beta-aminopropionitrile treatment. These findings suggest that stroke-prone rats have an enhanced minor connective tissue defect that is expressed by rupture of the internal elastic lamina and may be related, at least in part, to their greater vascular fragility and increased susceptibility to stroke.\r"

We studied 15 chronically instrumented fetal sheep following transient cerebral ischemia, to estimate changes in extracellular space using an impedance technique, to quantify the electroencephalogram with real-time spectral analysis, and to assess histologic outcome 3 days after the insult. These measurements were made in the parasagittal cortex. There was a rapid loss of extracellular space from 5 +/- 2 minutes after the onset of ischemia. Following 10 minutes of ischemia (n = 7) the intracellular edema peaked but then quickly resolved (6 +/- 4 minutes), and mild selective neuronal loss was seen. In contrast, the swelling was biphasic after 30-40 minutes of ischemia (n = 8). The early edema resolved slowly (28 +/- 12 minutes) but incompletely, and secondary swelling began at 7 +/- 2 hours and peaked at 28 +/- 6 hours. The early swelling was the more severe. Postinsult epileptiform activity began at 8 +/- 2 hours and peaked at 10 +/- 3 hours; later there was laminar necrosis of the underlying cortex. The secondary decrease of extracellular space indicates that a progressive loss of membrane function started with the onset of postischemic epileptiform activity. The increased metabolic load of the epileptiform activity may have worsened this delayed deterioration.\r"

The aim of this study was to investigate factors correlated with blood pressure elevation in 843 consecutive stroke patients on hospital admission to a nonintensive stroke unit. Using a multivariate analysis model, we analyzed the influence on admission blood pressure of sex, age, previous hypertension, cardiac failure, diabetes, type of stroke, impaired consciousness, and latency between onset of symptoms and admission. Previous hypertension was the strongest predictor (p less than 0.001) of elevated blood pressure on admission, followed by the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage (p less than 0.001). The latency between onset of symptoms and admission showed no correlation with blood pressure levels at hospitalization. Previously, high blood pressure levels on hospital admission have been shown to decline within a few days in hospital. We therefore hypothesize that mental stress on hospital admission may be a major factor in the blood pressure elevation seen in acute stroke.\r"

We determined the sensitivity and specificity of an abnormal acid phosphatase, an abnormal alkaline phosphatase, and the presence of bone pain used in combination for assessing bone metastases. If at least one of these three parameters was present, the sensitivity was 97 percent, whereas if all three tests were normal, the specificity was 78 percent. The negative predictive value for all three tests combined is 99 percent. These results suggest that a routine bone scan to stage patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who have no bone pain and normal acid and alkaline phosphatases may not be warranted in all cases.\r"

In the last two years the no-incision technique was used whenever feasible (31 patients) with an identical cure rate of 94 percent. Varying degrees of urinary retention occurred in 58 percent and was even more prevalent following the no-incision technique (68%). Owing to the high incidence of urinary retention a punch suprapubic cystostomy is now used in most patients. We conclude that endoscopic urethropexy is an effective means of correcting stress urinary incontinence. The no-incision technique is associated with even less morbidity and a reduction in hospital stay without compromising the outcome.\r"

It allows stenting of the ureteral-intestinal anastomosis and safeguards against urinary leak or extravasation; at the same time the catheter is accessible to the outside for easy replacement, manipulation, and radiographic evaluation. The catheter has also shown to be useful for other purposes such as uretero-neo-cystostomy.

In this retrospective cohort study, the medical records of 776 patients were audited 24 to 35 months after mammography to estimate the frequency of indeterminate lesions, the probability of malignancy, and the rate of patients' compliance with recommendations. Almost 2% of patients retested after an indeterminate mammogram were found to have breast cancer (95% confidence limits 0.2% and 5.9%). Only 26% of the patients retested during the audit period had the test within the suggested upper limit of 6 months. We conclude that timely follow-up after an indeterminate mammogram is advisable and that for the population we studied, compliance with this recommendation is low.\r"

  ".W": "Although the supply of physicians in the United States has doubled during the past 20 years, there is still disagreement as to whether we currently have or should expect a significant surplus of physicians. The evidence suggests that despite the rapid expansion in the pool of available physicians, serious physician shortages persist for certain rural populations, ethnic and occupational groups, and other medically disadvantaged segments of the population. Medical students' declining interest in rural practice and primary care specialties suggests that problems of geographic and specialty maldistribution may worsen despite a rising population of physicians. It is unlikely that a significant physician surplus will develop unless there is a conscious attempt to limit the proportion of national wealth expended on medical care. Pockets of shortage can be reduced by broadening the availability of health insurance, lessening large income disparities between different specialties, changing the way teaching institutions are reimbursed for their training costs, and supporting direct governmental service programs such as the National Health Service Corps.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoporosis is a common age-related disorder manifested clinically by skeletal fractures, especially fractures of the vertebrae, hip, and distal forearm. The major cause of these fractures is low bone mass, although an increase in trauma due to falls in the elderly also contributes. There are multiple causes for the low bone mass which, in any given individual, may contribute differently to the development of the osteopenia. The most important groups of causes are failure to achieve adequate peak bone mass, slow bone loss due to processes relating to aging, the menopause in women, and a variety of sporadic behavioral, nutritional, and environmental factors that affect bone mass in some but not in other individuals. The most important approach is prevention. Drugs and behavioral factors known to cause bone loss should be eliminated and perimenopausal women should be evaluated for possible preventive administration of estrogen. For patients with fractures due to established osteoporosis, the only drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration are the antiresorptive agents calcium, estrogen, and calcitonin. Formation-stimulating regimens, however, are being developed and may be available for clinical use in the foreseeable future. These regimens may be capable of increasing bone mass to above the fracture threshold, thereby resulting in a clinical cure of the osteoporosis.\r"

The quinolones are important prophylactic agents for neutropenic patients. Adverse reactions to these compounds have been exceedingly infrequent. Important drug-drug interactions occur, and the absorption of the compounds can be markedly impaired by antacids. Resistance to quinolones is already a serious problem in some countries. Improper use in the United States will rapidly make the new quinolones ineffective treatment for staphylococcal, Pseudomonas, and even some Enterobacteriaceae infections.

  ".U": "91221013\r", 
  ".W": "After nearly three decades of consistently disappointing adjuvant therapy trials in resectable colorectal cancer, recently emerging results offer some basis for cautious optimism. Adjuvant fluorouracil-containing regimens appear to confer a modest treatment benefit in completely resected colonic adenocarcinomas. The two most promising chemotherapy approaches at present appear to be the fluorouracil-levamisole and fluorouracil-leucovorin regimens. The optimal schedule and dose of these agents remains to be determined. Portal vein chemotherapy infusion studies have yielded promising but inconclusive results to date. As data from completed or ongoing large group studies become available, the role of this modality will be better clarified. In rectal cancer, adjuvant radiotherapy alone has a modest but consistent ability to reduce local recurrence without demonstrating any survival advantage. The optimal dose and sequencing of radiotherapy remains poorly defined. Two completed cooperative group studies strongly suggest that the optimal use of radiotherapy is in combination with chemotherapy. The independent role of chemotherapy in rectal cancer remains unclear. There is suggestive evidence that adjuvant chemotherapy is more effective with rectal cancer than with primaries arising proximal to the peritoneal reflection. Despite the large number of unresolved questions that remain, the following interim treatment recommendations can be made: 1. Patients with Dukes' B and C rectal and colonic adenocarcinomas should be entered into an appropriate adjuvant clinical trial when feasible. 2. Outside the setting of a protocol, there is a sound rationale to treat Dukes' B and C rectal cancer with combination chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy. The chemotherapy could consist of fluorouracil either alone or combined with leucovorin. 3. In more proximal colonic tumors (above the pelvic peritoneal reflection), recently described improvements in survival for patients with Dukes' B disease suggests that adjuvant therapy should be withheld in this group when not participating in a clinical study. Patients with Dukes' C tumors should receive fluorouracil-levamisole.\r"

Elevated levels of Lp(a) have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and Lp(a) has been shown to be highly heritable. Our purpose was to determine the prevalence of familial Lp(a) excess in patients with CAD. We determined plasma levels of Lp(a) in 180 patients (150 men and 30 women) with angiographically documented CAD before age 60 years, and in 459 control subjects (276 men and 183 women) clinically free of cardiovascular disease. In addition, Lp(a) levels were determined in families of 102 of the CAD probands (87 men and 15 women). No gender differences in Lp(a) levels were observed between men and women (patients or control subjects). Patients with CAD had higher Lp(a) levels than did control subjects (19 +/- 21 vs 13 +/- 15 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). The prevalence of Lp(a) excess (defined as greater than 90th percentile of controls) was 17% in patients with CAD (p less than 0.05). Lp(a) levels were not correlated with cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or apolipoproteins A-I or B. There was a weak correlation between Lp(a) and triglycerides (r = 0.166, p less than 0.05) in patients and control subjects. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that Lp(a) was a risk factor for the presence of CAD in men, independent of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, LDL and HDL cholesterol, or apolipoprotein A-I and B levels. Family studies revealed that Lp(a) levels are strongly genetically determined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Angioplasty operators, technicians, nurses and patients were blinded to the agent used. All patients were pretreated with 0.6 mg of atropine sulfate intravenously before any contrast injections. Hypotension (mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg associated with contrast injections) occurred during 8.5% of PTCA procedures in which the patients were receiving iopamidol and during 9.5% of the procedures in which the patients were given diatrizoate (difference not significant). Bradycardia (heart rate of less than 40 beats/min associated with contrast injections) developed during 5.7% of procedures when patients were given iopamidol and during 5.1% of procedures when patients were given diatrizoate (difference not significant). The need for additional atropine or temporary pacing during the procedure was similar for patients given iopamidol and diatrizoate. The overall incidence of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, or both, during the procedure occurred less frequently when iopamidol was used compared with diatrizoate (1 vs 2.5%, p = 0.045). These serious ventricular arrhythmias were attributable to contrast injections in 0.6% of the PTCA procedures when iopamidol was given and in 2.0% of the cases in which diatrizoate was the contrast agent (p = 0.09). Only 1 patient had an allergic reaction to the contrast agent, and this was in a patient who received iopamidol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of these, 224 patients (13.6%) had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%, 412 (25.1%) had prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and 48 (2.9%) had left main artery dilatation. Of the 1,640 PTCA procedures, 697 were in patients with 2-vessel disease and 943 were in patients with 3-vessel disease. A mean 3.5 lesions were dilated per patient, with an overall angiographic success rate of 96%. Complete revascularization was achieved in 857 (52%). A total of 52 patients (3.2%) had a major in-hospital complication: 27 patients (1.6%) died, 24 (1.4%) had a Q-wave myocardial infarction, and 14 (0.8%) underwent emergent CABG. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% (p less than or equal to 0.001), 3-vessel disease (p less than or equal to 0.01), female gender (p less than or equal to 0.02), and PTCA between 1981 and 1985 (p less than or equal to 0.05) as independent predictors of mortality.

  ".W": "Coronary artery dissection is an infrequent but serious complication of coronary angioplasty that can lead to periprocedural vessel occlusion, emergency bypass surgery, myocardial infarction or death. Recently, a perfusion balloon catheter was developed that permits passive perfusion of blood through the central lumen of the catheter. It enables prolonged balloon inflations to be performed and has been used to provide distal blood flow after coronary occlusion. To evaluate the effectiveness of the perfusion balloon catheter in patients with major coronary dissections, 36 consecutive patients treated with the perfusion balloon catheter were compared with 46 consecutive patients treated before its availability. The 2 groups were similar in terms of clinical, angiographic and initial procedural characteristics. Use of the perfusion balloon catheter permitted a significantly longer inflation than standard balloon inflation (average 18 +/- 5 min). Angiographic success was significantly greater with the perfusion balloon catheter (84 vs 62% for conventional therapy), whereas complications were markedly reduced (48 vs 78%). With the perfusion balloon catheter there were fewer deaths (2 vs 6%), myocardial infarctions (14 vs 40%) and emergency bypass operations (11 vs 25%). The findings of this retrospective comparison demonstrate that the perfusion balloon catheter is effective for the management of major dissections after coronary angioplasty. The use of the perfusion balloon catheter should be considered when a major coronary dissection occurs and when emergency bypass surgery is contemplated.\r"

Pulsed Doppler echocardiographic measurements were performed in 40 patients with single left anterior descending artery narrowing before, and 10 and 30 days after angioplasty. Minimal luminal diameter and percent diameter stenosis of coronary lesions were measured by computer-assisted quantitation. The ratio of early to late diastolic flow velocities (E/A ratio), time velocity integral of early diastolic filling period (Ei) and the ratio of early and late diastolic filling periods (Ei/Ai ratio) increased gradually after angioplasty. Minimal luminal diameter correlated significantly with the percent changes in E/A ratio (r = 0.59 at 10 days, r = 0.57 at 30 days), Ei (r = 0.53 at 10 days, r = 0.55 at 30 days) and Ei/Ai ratio (r = 0.41 at 10 days, r = 0.49 at 30 days). Percent diameter stenosis showed overall weaker correlations than minimal diameter with the percent changes in E/A ratio (r = 0.39 at 10 days, r = 0.32 at 30 days) and Ei (r = 0.38 at 10 days, r = 0.31 at 30 days). Thus, LV diastolic filling improves serially after coronary angioplasty in patients with 1-vessel disease. The magnitude of improvement in diastolic filling correlates better with minimal luminal diameter than percent diameter stenosis. Therefore, minimal luminal diameter is a better predictor of changes in Doppler transmitral flow parameters after angioplasty than percent diameter stenosis.\r"

To further investigate potential triggers of ischemia, certain defined and distinct episodes of waking and rising during the nighttime were examined. Of 113 patients who underwent ambulatory monitoring of the electrocardiogram, 466 episodes of ischemia lasting 3,926 minutes were detected in 67 of the patients. In 30 patients who had ischemia at night, 21 reported 36 occasions of waking and rising, and 67% of these events were associated with ST-segment depression. Frequency and duration of ischemia were similar in the nocturnal episodes versus the early morning episodes of ischemia as were the increases in heart rate at 30, 10, 5 and 1 minute before the onset. Even before waking, there was an increase in heart rate beginning approximately 30 minutes before the onset of ischemia. This increase became significant 5 minutes before onset both in the early morning and on rising at night. Patients with nocturnal ischemia had significantly worse clinical signs of CAD. This study shows that rising at night is often associated with episodes of myocardial ischemia and, like the morning events on rising, is likely an important trigger of ischemia in patients with CAD.\r"

All patients underwent 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and exercise testing after assessment of their autonomic function and pain threshold. Silent myocardial ischemia, defined as greater than or equal to 1 mm of ST-segment depression on either exercise testing or ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, was corroborated by exercise-induced reversible defect(s) on tomographic thallium scintigraphy. Autonomic function was assessed by heart rate response to: (1) Valsalva maneuver, (2) deep breathing, and (3) upright posture, as well as by diastolic blood pressure response to sustained handgrip and systolic blood pressure response to upright posture. Autonomic dysfunction was defined as greater than or equal to 2 abnormal responses. Pain threshold measurements were performed using electrical cutaneous stimulation of both forearms. Of the 58 diabetic patients, 21 were found to have autonomic dysfunction (36%). Silent myocardial ischemia was detected in 10 patients (17%), and was significantly more frequent in patients with than without autonomic dysfunction (38 vs 5%, p = 0.003). There was no difference in the electrical pain threshold or tolerance in subjects with and without silent myocardial ischemia. It is concluded that silent myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic diabetic men occurs frequently and in association with autonomic dysfunction, suggesting that diabetic neuropathy may be implicated in the mechanism of silent myocardial ischemia.\r"

Angina was the limiting symptom in 11 of 53; the other 42 stopped exercise with dyspnea or fatigue, or both. Oxygen consumption was measured on-line during exercise with a metabolic cart. RV ejection fraction and LV ejection fraction were measured by validated methods from gated blood pool radionuclide ventriculography. There were weak but statistically significant correlations between exercise oxygen consumption and exercise RV ejection fraction (r = 0.30, p less than 0.05) and between exercise oxygen consumption and exercise LV ejection fraction (r = 0.38, p less than 0.01). Multivariate regression analysis, including exercise RV ejection fraction, exercise LV ejection fraction and exercise heart rate versus exercise oxygen consumption revealed a better relation (r = 0.48, p less than 0.005) than any variable in univariate regression. The values of RV and LV ejection fraction at rest did not correlate significantly (r = 0.2, difference not significant), but the exercise values did correlate weakly (r = 0.41, p less than 0.01). The reserve of LV ejection fraction, defined as exercise minus rest value, correlated weakly with exercise oxygen consumption (r = 0.32, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With a stratified, parallel group design, 201 low-risk patients with evidence of depression or anxiety, or both, after AMI, were randomized to either an 8-week program of exercise conditioning and behavioral counseling or to conventional care. Although the differences were small, significantly greater improvement was seen in rehabilitation group patients at 8 weeks in the emotions dimension of a new disease-specific, health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire, in their state of anxiety and in exercise tolerance. All measures of health-related quality of life in both groups improved significantly over the 12-month follow-up period. However, the 95% confidence intervals around differences between groups at the 12-month follow-up effectively excluded sustained, clinically important benefits of rehabilitation in disease-specific (limitations, -2.70, 1.40; emotions, -4.86, 1.10, where negative values favor conventional care and positive values favor rehabilitation) and generic health-related quality of life (time trade-off, -0.062, 0.052; quality of well-being, -0.042, 0.035) or in exercise tolerance (-38.5, 52.1 kpm/min); also, return to work was similar in the 2 groups (relative risk, 0.93; confidence interval, 0.71, 1.64).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Estimated nutrient intakes were also compared with those from the Department of Agriculture's 1985 and 1986 Continuing Survey of Food Intake of Individuals. The average diet reported in this study satisfied National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines for cholesterol intake, but was higher than that recommended for total and saturated fats. In addition, dietary fat intake was influenced by sex, age and geographic region. Reduction in total and saturated fat intake was confined to men greater than 35 years of age; intake of these nutrients was highest among young, Mid-western women. These results suggest the need for diet intervention programs, targeted specifically to young adults with additional consideration given to regional variation. Repeated surveys of cardiac care givers might be used as an early indicator of the nationwide effectiveness of dietary intervention programs.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-two infants with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) (21 asymptomatic and 21 symptomatic) were compared with 17 control infants to determine if symptoms of congestive heart failure (i.e., tachypnea/poor growth) were due to depressed contractility or defect size, or both. Echocardiographic indexes of defect size, left ventricular performance (shortening fraction), preload (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension), afterload (left ventricular end-systolic wall stress) and contractility (the relation between velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and wall stress) were measured. Clinical assessment included measurement of weight and respiratory rate. Pulmonary and systemic blood flow were assessed in 17 symptomatic and 3 asymptomatic patients by cardiac catheterization. Although there was no significant difference in age, the symptomatic group had significantly lower weight (5.5 +/- 2.9 vs 7.3 +/- 2.3 kg, p less than 0.05) and a higher respiratory rate (53 +/- 14 vs 43 +/- 6 breaths/min, p less than 0.05), compared with control subjects. The mean pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio in the symptomatic group was 2.9:1. Preload indexed for body surface area was significantly higher in the groups with a VSD compared with control subjects (asymptomatic, 8.5 +/- 1.7 cm/m2; symptomatic, 9.1 +/- 1.7 cm/m2; control subjects, 6.8 +/- 1.1 cm/m2; p less than 0.05). Shortening fraction, afterload and contractility were not significantly different among all groups. A defect size greater than 0.5 cm (or defect size indexed for body surface area greater than 1.8 cm/m2) was predictive of the presence of symptoms. It is concluded that contractility is normal in infants with a VSD. Symptoms may be related to pulmonary congestion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cardiac volumes were measured with patients in the supine position and 5 minutes after they assumed an upright posture using radionuclide ventriculography, while heart rate, blood pressure and forearm cutaneous flow were recorded continuously and simultaneously. Only the expected age-related increase in mean arterial pressure (young subjects, 79 +/- 1 mm Hg; elderly subjects, 99 +/- 3 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) distinguished the 2 groups at baseline. However, during upright tilt, elderly subjects had significant decreases in stroke volume (supine [108 +/- 9 ml] vs upright [78 +/- 9 ml]; p less than 0.01) and cardiac index (supine [3.4 +/- 0.2 liters/min/m2] vs upright [2.8 +/- 0.2 liters/min/m2]; p less than 0.05) because of an inability to reduce end-systolic volume (supine, 44 +/- 6 ml; upright, 51 +/- 7 ml); however, mean arterial pressure was maintained through an increase in peripheral resistance. In contrast, the young relied solely on cardiac adaptations to postural stress by decreasing end-systolic volume (supine, 62 +/- 5 ml; upright, 39 +/- 5 ml; p less than 0.01) and increasing heart rate (57 +/- 2 min-1 to 71 +/- 3 min-1, p less than 0.01), whereby cardiac output and mean arterial pressure were maintained during tilt.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Normal chest radiographs were present in 20 of 260 patients (8%) with acute PE and in 113 of 642 (18%) with suspected acute PE, in whom the diagnosis was excluded. A partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood less than or equal to 70 mm Hg in a dyspneic patient with a normal chest radiograph was more often seen among patients with PE (9 of 17, 53%) than among patients in whom PE was excluded (18 of 93, 19%; p less than 0.01). However, no combinations of blood gases, signs and symptoms were strictly diagnostic. High probability ventilation/perfusion scans among patients with a normal chest radiograph were indicative of PE in only 6 of 9 patients (67%). Among patients with low-probability ventilation/perfusion scans, 8 of 47 (17%) had PE. This study showed that the combination of dyspnea and hypoxia in a patient with a normal chest radiograph is a useful clue to the diagnosis of PE. Although intuition suggested that ventilation/perfusion scans would yield better results in patients with a normal chest radiograph, the ability to diagnose PE by ventilation/perfusion scans in this subset of patients was not enhanced, except by a reduction of the percentage of patients with intermediate probability scans.\r"

The pressure-dimension relation of the left atrium was composed of 2 loops: the A loop (expressing the pump function of the left atrium) and the V loop. LA dimension at the beginning of active LA shortening was significantly greater in hypertensive subjects (33 +/- 3 mm) and in those with myocardial infarction (32 +/- 4 mm) than in normal subjects (28 +/- 3 mm) (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05, respectively).

The presentation and gross characteristics of these tumors rarely differed from those of uncomplicated FAs. Carcinoma in situ (CIS) was the predominant type of malignancy (95%) found to arise in FAs, and lobular and ductal types occurred with equal frequency. Nine of ten FAs harboring an invasive carcinoma also contained CIS supporting the origin of the infiltrative component in the FAs. CIS within FAs was associated with in situ malignancy in surrounding breast tissue in 21% of cases. Age, fibroadenoma size, and type and extent of CIS were similar in patients with disease limited to the FA and in those with associated malignant disease in the remainder of the breast. Axillary nodal metastases were not detected. Sixty-three patients were observed for a mean period of 8.4 years. Only one of 26 patients with CIS within an FA who was treated conservatively developed an ipsilateral carcinoma. None of the 26 developed contralateral carcinoma; however, 3 of 23 with similar lesions, who were treated by mastectomy, did so. The contralateral carcinomas were invasive in two patients, one of whom died with distant metastases. Seven patients with FAs harboring lobular CIS underwent bilateral mastectomy. Their postoperative course was uneventful. None of seven patients with invasive carcinoma arising in an FA, two of whom were treated conservatively, succumbed to disease. However, one developed contralateral carcinoma. The authors recommend breast-conserving therapy for CIS arising in an FA.\r"

All 20 of the latter tumors showed the pattern of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. There were 20 cases of carcinoma with mesenchymal metaplasia, 7 cases of carcinoma with mixed epithelial (squamous) and mesenchymal metaplasia, and 7 cases of carcinoma with epithelial metaplasia (four mixed ductal/squamous and three pure squamous cell carcinomas). No patient with pure sarcoma had lymph node metastases develop; all nodal metastases were found in patients who had carcinoma with metaplasia, although in one case the carcinomatous component was seen only within a lymph node metastasis. Epithelial antigens were found not only within the epithelial elements of all cases of carcinoma, but also within the apparent mesenchymal elements of 44% of the carcinomas showing divergent differentiation. Flow cytometric analysis of eight cases of carcinoma with mesenchymal metaplasia showed aneuploidy/tetraploidy in six neoplasms. For patient management purposes, the distinction of pure sarcoma from carcinoma with metaplasia is important, but additional subclassification of carcinoma with metaplasia is of greater biologic than clinical interest.\r"

The authors' ten-year experience (1977-1987) included six cases of MCRCC that were followed for a minimum of two years, with neither recurrence nor metastasis observed in any of the cases. During this period, there were 855 urologic procedures for the upper urinary tract, with 256 neoplasms or cysts identified. These included 32 simple cysts, 41 transitional cell carcinomas, 133 renal cell carcinomas, 17 papillary renal cell carcinomas, and 33 miscellaneous tumors. Histologically, the MCRCCs were well-demarcated multicystic lesions containing variably sized aggregates of neoplastic clear cells showing grade 1 nuclear features and little or no mitotic activity. The cyst walls were densely fibrotic, and the lining was often devoid of epithelium. Flow-cytometric analysis performed in five of the six cases with the use of paraffin-embedded tissue showed the tumors to be diploid in all instances, with low proliferative activity. The authors believe that this tumor is a low-grade variant of renal cell carcinoma and should be studied further to determine appropriate therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with benign and malignant neoplasms of the cervix. One of the criteria for their etiologic role requires an assessment of whether virtually all or only a small fraction of lesions contain viral genomes. DNA preparations from colposcopically directed punch biopsies of cervical lesions were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of HPV DNA. The biopsy specimens represented different pathologic entities (koilocytosis, condyloma, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive carcinoma). In Southern blot hybridization with radioactive probes for HPV 11, 16, 18, 31, and 33, HPV DNA was detected in 74% of the biopsy specimens (42 of 57 cases), with the predominant types being HPV 16 and HPV 18. In contrast, after PCR amplification with primers yielding fragments of characteristic size for HPV 11, 16, and 18, the analysis of the same 57 biopsy specimens revealed that all samples were positive for at least one HPV type. To exclude false-positive PCR results, controls without HPV DNA were interspersed at regular intervals, and results were evaluated only if these controls remained HPV negative. To exclude false-negative results due to failure of the reaction, a target sequence within the c-Ha-ras-1 gene was used as an internal control. All HPV typing results obtained by Southern blot hybridization were in agreement with HPV typing by PCR. The higher number of positive samples in the latter analysis stems from the increased sensitivity of PCR, which was which was effective in identifying as few as 10-100 HPV DNA molecules; in contrast, the sensitivity of Southern blot hybridization was 1 pg, or approximately 10(5) molecules of HPV DNA. The authors conclude that, with sufficiently sensitive diagnostic methods, HPV DNA can be detected in most, if not all, neoplastic cervical lesions.\r"

However, the association of HPV with cervical adenocarcinoma has been studied less extensively. The authors evaluated the presence of HPV-DNA in 106 patients with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix by in situ hybridization, using 35S-labeled probes for HPV 16 DNA and HPV 18 DNA. The overall prevalence of HPV-DNA was 18% (19 of 106). HPV 16 was present in 2 (2%) cases, HPV 18 was observed in 15 (14%) cases, and both HPV 16 and HPV 18 were found in 2 (2%) cases. There was a correlation between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor stage (P less than 0.01) and tumor size (P less than 0.05), but there was no relationship between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor differentiation, proliferation (S-phase fraction), ploidy, lymph node metastases, or five-year survival rate. These results suggest that HPV 18 DNA is associated with cervical adenocarcinoma but the presence of HPV 18 has no influence on overall survival.\r"

One hundred thirty (96.3%) biopsy specimens were satisfactory for evaluation. Seventy-nine cases were nonneoplastic (60.8%); among these cases, a specific diagnosis of infectious disease was made in 17 (13.1%). A diagnosis of neoplastic disease was made in 50 (38.5%) cases, of which 14 (10.8%) were benign, 28 (21.5%) were malignant, and 8 (6.2%) were neoplasms of uncertain biologic potential. The sensitivity of pediatric FNA biopsies was 90.6%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, negative predictive value 94.7%, and efficiency of the test 96.5%. There were no false-positive diagnoses and there were four false-negative diagnoses, three of which involved aspirates of the central nervous system (CNS). Ancillary studies, including immunocytochemistry (20 cases), electron microscopic examination (18 cases), microbiologic culture (8 cases), cytogenetic studies (7 cases), and flow cytometry (3 cases), were performed on the aspirated material, enabling a more specific diagnosis or supplying additional information in many cases. Definitive diagnosis by FNA biopsy enabled radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy to be administered for unresectable malignant neoplasms, provided material for culture of infectious lesions, identified benign lesions not needing surgery, and aided the surgeon in planning the extent of surgery in resectable malignant neoplasms. These results support the greater use of FNA biopsy in the pediatric population.\r"

The projectiles, which were recovered from both the body and shooting area, contained microscopically recognizable cellular and inert material in all cases. Direct ballistic trauma could be documented in several tissue types, most notably in muscular tissue. Progressive damage to skeletal and cardiac muscle was seen in multiple preparations. This ranged from partial separation of the fascicles to cytoplasmic homogenization and nuclear rupture. Except in cases of severe ballistic trauma, skeletal and cardiac muscle could be distinguished on the preparations. In addition to neural tissue, projectiles traversing the central nervous system (CNS) contained elongated fragments of intact microvascular structures, sheets of cerebral covering cells, and connective tissue from the scalp. The vascular structures present in CNS preparations may clarify some of the clinical findings in victims of gunshot wounds and elucidate possible pathophysiologic mechanisms in craniocerebral projectile injuries.\r"

To the authors' knowledge, the 53-year-old woman reported is the oldest patient with histologically confirmed placental site trophoblastic tumor. Initially, surgery, radiation, and multiagent chemotherapy failed to control vaginal and pulmonary metastatic disease. After administration of four treatment cycles of a \"second-line\" chemotherapeutic regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and cisplatin, complete clinical and radiologic remission was achieved. The patient's serum level of human chorionic gonadotropin has remained undetectable, and she has been without measurable evidence of disease for 16 months.\r"

The authors report here the histologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic findings in four additional patients with such translocation. They represent 8% of 51 patients with NHL studied by cytogenetics in a provincial hospital of Western mainland Japan. Three of the patients had IDLL and one a follicular lymphoma of large cell type. These findings strengthen the association between t(11;14) and IDLL. Furthermore, the occurrence of t(11;14) in a follicular lymphoma, as the sole abnormality, along with histogenetic considerations, suggests the possible existence of a rarer subset of follicular lymphoma, not associated with the t(14;18) and histogenetically related to IDLL.\r"

Immunoglobulin expression was present in 254 cases (74%) of B-cell lymphomas (IgM kappa, 122; IgM lambda, 82; light chain only, 40; mu heavy chain only, 10). Immunoglobulin expression occurred with the greatest frequency in lymphomas of small lymphocytic, small cleaved cell, and small noncleaved cell histologic types (93%, 100%, 100%, respectively) and occurred with the least frequency in lymphomas of large cell (cleaved and noncleaved) and immunoblastic histologic types (59% each). Other lymphomas demonstrated intermediate frequencies of immunoglobulin expression. An excess of cases expressing lambda light chain was noted overall (kappa-lambda ratio of 1.3; expected, 2.0) and was particularly evident for intermediate lymphocytic and follicular mixed histologic types (kappa-lambda ratios of 0.8 and 0.9, respectively). Immunoglobulin expression in B-cell lymphomas varies as a function of cellular differentiation as reflected in the histologic type and grade of the Working Formulation. An excess of cases expressing lambda light chain in specific histologic categories suggests the possibility that lymphocytes bearing the lambda light chain rearrangement may be more susceptible to certain types of lymphomatous transformation.\r"

The staining characteristics of L60 and UCHL1 were compared to determine the value of each in the immunophenotypic analysis of PTCLs. Lineage specificity was evaluated among 39 B-cell lymphomas and 33 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD). L60 and/or UCHL1 stained 95% of PTCLs, whereas L60 and UCHL1 alone stained 90% and 69% of cases, respectively. L60 demonstrated significantly greater numbers of immunopositive tumor cells than UCHL1 in 37% of the PTCL cases, principally because of enhanced marking of large, neoplastic cells. UCHL1 was a better marker in only 10% of the PTCL cases. L60 stained 33% of B-cell lymphomas, usually small lymphocytic or lymphoplasmacytic types. UCHL1 stained only 8% of B-cell lymphomas, all large-cell types. L60 and UCHL1 stained Reed-Sternberg cells and variants in three cases of nodular sclerosing HD. These results suggest that both L60 and UCHL1 are useful markers of PTCLs in routinely processed tissue. L60 is a more sensitive marker of large neoplastic T-cells than UCHL1 but is less lineage-specific. These antibodies are most effective when used as part of a panel of monoclonal antibodies.\r"

The authors describe a patient with MHA who had no history of hemorrhage but who developed complete coronary thrombosis after attempted angioplasty despite an apparent platelet count of 24,000 per mm3. Laboratory investigations revealed a normal bleeding time, normal platelet aggregation, and an increase in the size of approximately two-thirds of the platelets. The calculated platelet mass was near normal, which probably explains the thrombosis despite a decrease in platelet numbers. The authors conclude that in some patients with MHA platelets are functionally active both in vivo and in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) takes its name from the characteristic rash that occurs as a consequence of vasculitis associated with rickettsial invasion of the endothelium. The authors examined sera from 14 patients with serologically confirmed RMSF for the presence of antibodies (IgG and IgM) reactive with human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells and with the phospholipids cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidyl serine (PS). Sera from 7 patients (50%) exhibited antiendothelial antibodies, and 10 (71%) patient sera reacted with CL and/or PS. Because such antibodies may interfere with or augment endothelial thrombosis-related activities, acute and convalescent sera were tested for their effects on endothelial PGI2 secretion and protein C activation. Acute sera from two patients and convalescent sera from four patients stimulated protein C activation. Additionally, sera from five acute and nine convalescent cases inhibited basal endothelial PGI2 secretion, but sera from two acute and three convalescent cases stimulated thrombin-dependent PGI2 secretion. These results demonstrated that, in a significant proportion of patients, RMSF was accompanied by the appearance of antibodies that bound to endothelial cells and to phospholipids; some of these antibodies may have altered anticoagulant endothelial functions.\r"

The authors analyzed the transfusion records of 36 patients (26 women, 10 men) who received leukopoor platelets following febrile reactions to unmodified platelets. These patients received 409 unmodified transfusions (mean/patient 11) with 84 febrile reactions (rate 20.5%). Reaction rates to unmodified, non-HLA-matched single donor platelets (14.0%) and HLA-matched platelets (6.5%) were significantly lower than to pooled concentrates (27.2%) (P less than .01 and P less than .001, respectively). Of 623 leukopoor transfusions (mean/patient 17), 84 resulted in reactions (13.5%). Although leukodepletion significantly lowered the overall reaction rate as compared with unmodified products (P less than .02), a majority of patients (28 of 36) continued to have reactions. When individual reaction rates to unmodified and leukopoor transfusions were compared, only two patients showed a significant decrease in their reaction rate with leukopoor platelets. It appears that most susceptible patients continue to react to leukopoor platelets, particularly when pooled concentrates are used, and many patients show no reduction in reaction rate.\r"

However, treatment with neuraminidase produced a marked decrease in the ALP variant's electrophoretic mobility and a reduction in its molecular weight. A bone marrow biopsy revealed metastatic infiltration of the bone marrow by adenocarcinoma of the prostate accompanied by a remarkable amount of new bone formation, suggesting a bone origin for the unusual isoenzyme.

Many, but not all, adolescent and adult patients with reflux nephropathy (RN) give a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) or unexplained fevers in infancy or early childhood, when the kidney is thought to be at greatest risk of injury. Although vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is observed more commonly in infants than children with UTI, it is rare in uninfected patients at any age and should never be considered a normal finding during human development. Renal scarring may not be obvious in radiographic or radionuclear studies to medical management alone, no definite benefit of one over the other was observed, regardless of the grade of VUR. Moreover, progressive renal injury in scarred kidneys has been noted even after VUR had been corrected, when infection had been prevented, and while hypertension had been controlled satisfactorily. Focal glomerular sclerosis, a lesion found in patients with proteinuria and RN, has been identified not only in scarred kidneys, but also may be seen in contralateral, unscarred kidneys without VUR, which might suggest a humoral factor or, perhaps, a hyperfiltration phenomenon. RN is one of the most frequent causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in children, adolescents, and young adults, which is potentially preventable. However, prevention will depend on early identification of patients at risk--infants and young children after the first UTI and siblings of patients with VUR--aggressive and effective treatment of UTI, minimizing intravesical pressure, and education of patients, parents, and physicians.\r"

Causes of death for 246 (96%) of the deceased patients were analyzed. Despite an increase in age and number of comorbid diseases before transplantation, posttransplant survival increased significantly over the study period. All-cause mortality rates at 1, 2, and 5 years decreased significantly. Infectious disease cumulative mortality rates at 1, 2, and 5 years also decreased between 1966 and 1985. No trend in the 1-, 2-, or 5-year cardiovascular disease cumulative mortality rates was detected. The decline in the rate of deaths due to infection led to a decrease in the proportion of infection-related deaths and an associated increase in the proportion of cardiovascular disease-related deaths. The reduction in mortality over the past 2 decades is associated with the simultaneous improvement in immunosuppression and treatment of infectious diseases.\r"

To evaluate reasons for and consequences of this discrepancy, we studied both the frequency of various donor and recipient blood type combinations and their outcomes. Among 37,659 cadaveric renal transplants performed during 1983 through 1989, there were 2,625 transplants (7%) received by patients of compatible but nonidentical blood types. Of 18,575 type O donor organs, 16,784 were received by type O patients for a recipient to donor ratio of 0.9. The corresponding ratios were greater than 1.0 for all other blood types (1.02 for blood type A, 1.14 for type B, and 2.18 for type AB). This causes blood type O patients to have a lower access to transplantation and to have significantly longer waiting times than patients of all other blood types. This inequality of access diminished significantly (P less than 0.001) over the years, but did not resolve by 1989. Analysis of relative risk for first graft loss by multiple regression (Cox) showed that transplantation across compatible blood types had a 9.1% higher risk (P less than 0.1) than that of transplantation among identical blood types. Cadaveric renal transplantation within identical blood types optimizes access to transplantation and avoids further aggravating past disadvantages for blood type O recipients.\r"

Primary renal disease recurred in 11 of 583 functioning transplants (1.9%) with transplant loss in seven patients (1.2%): focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS, three patients); membranous glomerulonephritis (GN, one patient); mesangiocapillary GN (one patient); rapidly progressive IgA nephropathy (one patient); hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS, three patients); and oxalosis in two transplants (one patient). De novo renal disease occurred in six patients (1.0%), including mesangiocapillary GN type I (three patients); nonpurulent focal GN in septicemia (one patient); HUS (one patient); and nodular glomerulosclerosis in steroid diabetes (one patient). De novo membranous GN was seen in 14 additional cases (2.4%). No statistically significant difference could be established between the treatment groups without (n = 225) and with (n = 358) CsA in recurrent and de novo renal disease (n = 7/225 v 10/358, NS); in recurrent and de novo GN (n = 4/225 v 6/358, NS); in recurrent FSGS (n = 1/7 v 2/8, NS); in recurrent and de novo HUS (n - 1/1 v 2/7, NS); and in de novo membranous GN (n = 7/225 v 7/358, NS). Transplant loss by recurrent and de novo GN was higher without than with CsA (n = 4/4 v 1/6, P = 0.004). On the basis of our investigation, we conclude that recurrent and de novo renal disease in the transplant occur rarely and are not prevented by CsA. However, even if the incidence of transplant GN is unchanged by CsA treatment, its clinical course seems to be mitigated. CsA treatment also does not increase the incidence of HUS.\r"

Five of the six episodes (83%) were in allografts that had multiple renal arteries (MRA), giving an incidence of AAT in that group of 36%. Only one of 122 (0.8%) allografts with a single renal artery experienced thrombosis. CsA was started a mean of 9 days after transplantation (range, 16 to 33 days). There was no correlation of AAT to CsA levels. AAT appears to be an early complication of allografts with MRA in patients maintained on CsA.\r"

CsA treatment for 3 months resulted in a significant (P less than 0.01) reduction of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as compared with vehicle-treated animals. Histological examination of the kidneys showed mild glomerular damage characterized by ischemic lesions, increased mesangial matrix, and intracapillary hypercellularity in the CsA-treated group, but not in the vehicle-treated group. Proximal tubular abnormalities and limited areas of interstitial fibrosis were also present in the CsA group. A complete reconstruction of glomerular corpuscle was used to evaluate the consequence of CsA-induced renal ischemia on capillary tuft volume. The results showed that in rats administered CsA for 3 months glomerular volume distribution was shifted toward small glomeruli. Prolongation of CsA administration for 5 months did not result in a further decrease in GFR, and was associated with the appearance of a subset of glomeruli that became larger than normal. We have also investigated whether, once established, CsA-induced renal injury is reversible. In rats that were administered CsA for 3 months and then treatment discontinued for 2 months, GFR returned to pretreatment values and partial reversibility of morphologic changes was observed. Morphometric analysis showed that 2 months after withdrawal of CsA, glomerular volume distribution was almost comparable to that observed in vehicle-treated animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four patients had significant trabecular bone iron staining alone; eight patients had significant bone iron and bone aluminum staining; 13 patients had significant bone aluminum staining alone; and 23 patients showed no significant bone aluminum or iron staining. Patients with significant bone iron staining were younger (37.4 +/- 5.3 years v 53.2 +/- 2.3 years, P less than 0.01, mean +/- SEM) and were more likely to be anephric (P less than 0.001) and to have a history of prior renal transplantation (P less than 0.10). The 12 patients with significant bone iron staining had received more blood transfusions than those without bone iron staining (96 +/- 22.8 U v 22 +/- 5.8 U, P less than 0.005). Patients with bone iron accumulation had higher levels of serum ferritin (3,594 +/- 1,138.4 micrograms/L [ng/mL] v 265 +/- 60.1 micrograms/L, P less than 0.01) and lower levels of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (349 +/- 150 microLEq/mL v 1,801 +/- 397 microLEq/mL [386 +/- 166 pmol/L v 1,990 +/- 439 pmol/L], P less than 0.005). BIC was also higher in these patients (1,008 +/- 149 micrograms iron/g bone v 300 +/- 46.5 micrograms iron/g bone, P less than 0.001) and higher than normal BIC (256 +/- 44.2 micrograms iron/g bone, eight normals). Bone marrow iron stores were positively related to serum ferritin levels (P less than 0.01) and trabecular bone iron staining (P less than 0.10). All 13 patients with osteomalacia demonstrated significant bone aluminum staining; seven of these patients demonstrated concomitant significant iron staining. Fourteen of 15 patients with severe hyperparathyroidism showed no significant iron or aluminum staining. Our data indicate that iron will probably not accumulate within bone until all other storage sites (eg, bone marrow) are fully saturated. The presence of lower levels of iPTH in iron-overloaded patients raises the possibility that iron overload may induce a state of relative hypoparathyroidism. The most important determinant for the presence of osteomalacia seems to be the presence of significant aluminum staining. No specific bone histologic finding was related to the presence of bone iron staining, but the rarity of isolated significant bone iron staining makes it difficult to evaluate bone histologic diagnoses that might be solely attributable to iron.\r"

Four of the five children diagnosed as West syndrome, Lennox syndrome, or petit mal epilepsy also had cerebral palsy and microcephaly. The other patient had petit mal epilepsy without cerebral palsy and microcephaly. All patients first developed infantile spasms, with the time of onset ranging from 1 week to 2 years of age, and subsequently developed proteinuria, followed by the nephrotic syndrome at 3 to 14 years of age. Four of the five developed terminal renal failure between 7 and 11 years of age. Three subsequently died, but the other underwent kidney transplantation and is still living without further complications. The light, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical studies performed on the renal biopsies from all the patients and on the autopsy specimens from two cases exhibited FSGS-like lesions. Besides segmental hyalinosis, differing degrees of mesangiolysis were seen, which sometimes developed into dissecting microaneurysms of the glomerular capillary loops. The clinical picture described can be differentiated from congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) or infantile nephrotic syndrome (INS) with respect to the age of onset, outcome, and morphological appearance.

Each of these patients presented with obstructive symptoms, proteinuria, leukocyturia, and hematuria. The urinary sediment normalized with treatment of the underlying granulomatous vasculitis. Wegener's granulomatosis is a rare cause of prostatic obstructive symptoms, but should be considered whenever the relatively unusual entity of granulomatous prostatitis is diagnosed. One patient was initially treated exclusively with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). He responded, but noted recurrence during the 15th month of treatment. We also report on this patient's antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers, which correlated with clinical assessment and predicted recurrence 2 months before elevation of the Westergren sedimentation rate (WSR) and clinical diagnosis.\r"

We report a dramatic case of severe hypernatremia secondary to repetitive administration of activated charcoal-sorbitol suspension for the treatment of phenobarbital intoxication in an adult. Based on our experience with this case, several recommendations are provided regarding management of drug intoxications with charcoal-sorbitol suspension, including meticulous attention to fluid-electrolyte balance, type of replacement fluid, and dosing of the suspension.\r"

In these models, glomerular injury is related to increased glomerular pressure and to kidney and glomerular hypertrophy. As summarized in Table 1, administration of a calcium antagonist reduces the prevalence of glomerular sclerosis in all three models. Calcium antagonists have many effects that might tend to reduce renal injury. Similar to the ACE inhibitors, they may reduce PGC, although a protective effect has been observed in some models despite persistence of marked glomerular capillary hypertension. Calcium antagonists also appear to inhibit compensatory renal growth. The observation that these drugs lessen injury in experimental hypertension has important implications for the treatment of patients with hypertension and renal disease. However, widespread use of calcium antagonists specifically to prevent kidney damage should await the results of controlled clinical trials.\r"

Recombinant granzyme B was generated using a prokaryotic expression vector under the control of T7 transcription and translation signals. The 25-kd recombinant protein (granzyme B) was used to develop a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. Purified anti-granzyme B antibodies were used to detect the antigen expression in cytotoxic cells in human tissues. Using the avidin-biotin-complex peroxidase technique, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from patients with acute mild or moderate allograft cardiac rejection were stained. A constant cytoplasmic staining of the lymphocytic allograft infiltrate was observed. These results provide a basis for using the anti-granzyme B antibodies for detection of cytotoxic cells in human tissues. The detection and quantitative analysis of the granzyme-associated cytotoxic cells may help to evaluate the significance of these functionally distinct cytotoxic cells in human tissues associated with increased expression of cytoplasmic granule effector molecules.\r"

Familial amyloidosis, Finnish type (FAF), is an autosomal-dominant form of systemic amyloidosis. The authors have isolated and partially sequenced the amyloid. The protein has significant sequence identity with gelsolin, an actin-modulating protein. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised to the FAF amyloid not only immunostain the amyloid but also LBs in the cortex and substantia nigra of Parkinson's and diffuse LB disease brains. Immunoreactivity is absorbed by the purified amyloid but is unaffected by ubiquitin. This provides a link between the LB and one of the human amyloidoses, FAF.\r"

The process by which surfactant is produced and exported and by which its production by pulmonary cells is regulated are not well understood. This study was designed to identify a cellular receptor for surfactant constituents. To do so, monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against antibodies to porcine and rabbit surfactant proteins were prepared. These monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies bind both alveolar lining and bronchial epithelial cells in rabbit, porcine, and human lungs. Macrophages and other nonepithelial cells do not react with these antibodies. Western blot analysis indicates that both A2R and A2C recognize the same proteins in both pig and rabbit lungs: a 30-kd protein and additional proteins at 52 and 60 kd. Preincubating lung wash cells with A2C or A2R prevents binding of porcine or rabbit surfactant preparations, respectively, by these cells. Preincubating frozen sections of lung tissue with surfactant inhibits binding of A2R and A2C to the lung. Antibody directed to a cell membrane protein that recognizes alveolar surfactant may be useful in elucidating the structure and function of this receptor and in understanding the cellular physiology and pathophysiology of the surfactant system.\r"

In the present report, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), members of a family of macrophage-derived proteins known as cytokines, are shown to inhibit significantly the acute neutrophilic exodus caused by an intratracheal injection of endotoxin (LPS), a proinflammatory component of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria. Transforming growth factor beta (10 micrograms) and IL-6 (10 micrograms) coinjected intratracheally with LPS (10 micrograms) each inhibited the number of neutrophils in 6-hour bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens by approximately 50%. The intratracheal coinjection of IL-6, TGF beta, and LPS inhibited the LPS-induced neutrophilic inflammatory exodus by nearly 75%. Interleukin-6 also is shown to be endogenously upregulated within the lung after intratracheal challenge with endotoxin, providing evidence that IL-6 may represent an endogenous negative feedback mechanism to inhibit endotoxin-initiated cytokine-mediated acute inflammation. Interleukin-6 and TGF beta both strongly inhibited the quantity of TNF-alpha recovered in the BAL fluid of LPS-challenged rats, suggesting that downregulation of LPS-induced TNF-alpha production within the lung represents one mechanism whereby IL-6 and TGF beta exert an antiinflammatory action. Interleukin-6 and TGF beta represent novel pharmacologic and, probably, endogenous inhibitors of acute inflammation.\r"

In one group, proteinuria induced by aminonucleoside of puromycin (PAN) was reduced by using an 8% protein diet and adding the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril to the drinking water. Two control groups were injected with saline and PAN, respectively, and fed a 27% protein diet. The first group had significantly reduced albuminuria and a definite attenuation of tubular cell injury. There was a strong positive correlation between the number of interstitial macrophages and albuminuria. The beneficial effect was reproduced by dietary-protein restriction alone, whereas ACE inhibition alone had an insignificant effect on the degree of proteinuria. Depletion of circulating T lymphocytes in one group of nephrotic rats eliminated interstitial lymphocytes but did not affect interstitial macrophage influx. Inhibition of the in situ proliferation of resident interstitial macrophages by unilateral kidney irradiation failed to change the intensity of the macrophage infiltration. Treatment of rats with sodium maleate produced proximal tubular cell toxicity but interstitial inflammation did not develop, suggesting that the latter is not a nonspecific response to tubular injury. These studies demonstrate a strong relationship between tubulointerstitial nephritis and the severity of proteinuria in experimental nephrosis.\r"

In contrast, in vitro passaged FLCs injected intravenously were of low tumorigenicity, multiplied to a limited extent in the livers of suckling mice, and underwent marked differentiation from the proerythroblast to the orthochromatic erythroblast stage in the liver. The presence of characteristic C-type virions budding from the cell surface in various stages of erythroid differentiation served as a marker of the injected FLCs. When the same in vitro passaged FLCs that differentiated in the liver were injected subcutaneously in suckling mice, they formed large subcutaneous tumors consisting of sheets of undifferentiated tumor cells. It is concluded that the tumorigenicity of FLCs depended on the site of tumor growth and that there is an inverse correlation between the tumorigenic capacity and the capacity to differentiate.\r"

In addition, HIV-infected rabbits demonstrate prolonged cutaneous lesions (chancres) after intracutaneous challenge with T. pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis. Rabbits were infected by intravenous inoculation of 3 x 10(7) human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type III (HTLV-III)/B10 (HIV-1)-infected H9 (human) cells. Five weeks after initial infection, integrated HIV-1-specific DNA sequences were detected in the DNA of the peripheral blood lymphocytes of only one of eight rabbits using polymerase chain reactions (PCR); human DNA could not be detected at this time. Furthermore HIV infection could not be demonstrated by either seroconversion or PCR during the next 6 months. All HIV-infected rabbits remained clinically healthy and had normal white blood cell counts. Six months after HIV infection, four HIV-infected and two noninfected controls were superinfected with 10(6) T. pallidum in eight skin sites in the shaved skin of the back, and four infected and two control animals were challenged with an intradermal injection with SFV. After infection with either syphilis or SFV, the DNA from the white blood cells of all eight HIV-infected rabbits contained HIV sequences, and HIV sequences were demonstrated in dermal mononuclear cells of the syphilitic lesions by in situ hybridization. The SFV-induced tumors were rejected normally in the HIV-infected rabbits, but four of the four rabbits challenged with T. pallidum had delayed development of cutaneous lesions and three of four demonstrated larger and more prolonged lesions. White blood counts, mitogen responses, and interleukin-2 production remained within normal limits, and seroconversion for HIV was not detected. Three of four rabbits in a second group, challenged with T. pallidum 4 months after HIV-inoculation, also had delayed healing of syphilitic lesions. These results indicate that latent HIV-infection of rabbits may be activated by immunostimulation and that latently HIV-infected rabbits have impaired delayed hypersensitivity reactions. It is hypothesized that true latent HIV-infection in the rabbits is in monocytes and postulated that further immunostimulation may produce infection of lymphocytes and activation of disease.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to nuclear antigens are increasingly used as tools to obtain valuable information concerning the proliferative characteristics of various types of cancer. Prerequisite for the application of these MAbs in surgical pathology is establishment of the level of expression and/or cellular distribution of the antigens in relation to distinct cell-cycle compartments. In this study the topologic distribution of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an auxiliary protein of DNA polymerase delta, as recognized by human autoantiserum (AK) and two recently developed MAbs (19A2 and 19F4), was evaluated. Using cultured human cancer cells as a model system, and providing optimal fixation/permeation procedures are applied, these antibodies display a high affinity for PCNA bound to nuclear replicon clusters, resulting in distinct granular staining patterns. A more diffuse nucleoplasmic PCNA staining was mainly restricted to non-S-phase cells; in methanol-fixed cells, staining intensity of this form relative to the replicon-bound form appeared higher after staining with 19A2 than with 19F4 or AK. Comparing PCNA expression (detected with 19A2) with the expression of the Ki-67 antigen, PCNA-negative cells are also Ki-67 negative. In MCF-7 human breast cancer cells treated with 10(-6) mol/l (molar) tamoxifen, the fraction of nuclei showing replication patterns decreased from 42% to 8% within 8 days, but PCNA and Ki-67 antigens remained detectable in most cells during this interval, indicating a relatively slow decrease of antigen expression in cells that have entered a quiescent state. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10(-6) mol/l methotrexate resulted in a rapid accumulation of cells with an early S-phase DNA content; PCNA replication patterns showing a frequency distribution reflecting this DNA content were observed up to 48 hours after treatment. This indicates that the presence of replication patterns as visualized with anti-PCNAs is not a measure of replicative activity per se. It is concluded that, providing nuclear non-S-phase PCNA staining is faint relative to staining of replicon clusters, anti-PCNA antibodies may be excellent markers to detect in situ cells with S-phase DNA contents.\r"

Low-density lipoproteins also may serve as a source of lipids for the parasite membrane synthesis. Here LDL fluorescently labeled with carbocyanine dye (DiI-LDL) was used to measure the specificity of binding of LDL to the surface of schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni and to examine the distribution of the LDL particles over time. DiI-LDL binding was saturable and specific, with strong inhibition by unlabeled LDL and apoB but not by apoA1, bovine serum albumin, or IgG, and only weak inhibition by high-density lipoproteins. Half of the bound DiI-LDL was displaced by unlabeled LDL. DiI-LDL remained bound on the surface of schistosomula for up to 36 hours in culture. However parasites also ingested both DiI-LDL and a second fluorescent LDL, Bodipy-LDL. Over time, both fluorophores appeared throughout the worm tissues, suggesting the LDL particles were breaking down and that the fluorophores and lipids originally contained within the LDL particle were partitioning throughout the worm. Thus human LDL appears to bind to the surface of schistosomula specifically. Ingested LDL appears to be broken down and may serve as a source of host lipids for the parasite.\r"

  ".W": "The peculiarly fibrinous nature of bovine acute lung injury due to infection with Pasteurella haemolytica A1 suggests an imbalance between leukocyte-directed procoagulant and profibrinolytic influences in the inflamed bovine lung. Calves with experimental pneumonia produced by intratracheal inoculation with P. haemolytica A1 developed acute locally extensive cranioventral fibrinopurulent bronchopneumonia. Pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) recovered by segmental lavage from affected lung lobes were 30 times more procoagulant than PAM obtained from unaffected lung lobes and 37-fold more procoagulant than PAM from control calf lungs. Unlike the enhancement of procoagulant activity, profibrinolytic activity (plasminogen activator amidolysis) of total lung leukocytes (PAM and plasminogen activator neutrophils [PMN]) was decreased 23 times in cells obtained from affected lung lobes and also was decreased four times in cells obtained from unaffected lobes of infected animals. This marked imbalance in cellular procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity probably contributes significantly to enhanced fibrin deposition and retarded fibrin removal. In addition, PAM from inflamed lungs were strongly positive for bovine tissue factor antigen as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. Intensely tissue factor-positive PAM enmeshed in fibrinocellular exudates and positive alveolar walls were situated such that they were likely to have, in concert, initiated extrinsic activation of coagulation in the acutely inflamed lung. These data collectively suggest that enhanced PAM-directed procoagulant activity and diminished PAM- and PMN-directed profibrinolytic activity represent important modifications of local leukocyte function in bovine acute lung injury that are central to the pathogenesis of lesion development with extensive fibrin deposition and retarded fibrin removal.\r"

To determine lineage of the cells with chromosome aberrations, a combined immunohistochemical/cytogenetic approach was developed that enabled simultaneous ascertainment of cytogenetic aberrations and immunohistochemical features in individual cells. Immunohistochemical/cytogenetic evaluation of one hamartoma and two adenofibromas demonstrated that neoplastic proliferation, in each case, was confined to the mesenchymal (stromal) component, whereas epithelial cells appeared to be reactive. Cytogenetically abnormal short-term cultures of the remaining hamartoma and another of the breast adenofibromas were composed entirely of mesenchymal elements, indicating mesenchymal clonality in those tumors as well. Our findings support redesignation of pulmonary chondroid hamartomas as 'pulmonary chondromas' and suggest that carcinomas developing within fibroadenomas arise from reactive epithelial proliferation. Combined immunohistochemical/cytogenetic analysis might be useful in the development of novel therapeutic approaches that selectively target neoplastic populations within solid tumors.\r"

As collagen ages there is enhanced birefringence due to increased molecular and fibrillar organization. The purpose of this study was to develop a microscopal technique to quantify this process and to determine its ability to distinguish scars of varying ages. Fibrosis in the rat gracilis muscle was studied 5 to 63 days after superficial injury. Sections were stained with picrosirius red and illuminated with monochromatic, polarized light. The microscope fields were digitized using a computer-video system yielding an image in which noncollagenous material was dark (gray level 0) and collagen was depicted by grey levels 1 to 255. In the fibrosis model used, the collagen area fraction plateaued at 80% by day 21. The median collagen grey level increased progressively as the scar aged. It is concluded that this histologic, nondestructive technique can reliably quantify age-related optical properties of fibrotic collagen and that this could be used to determine the maturity of fibrotic lesions.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that perisinusoidal liver cells (PSC) play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of fibrocontractive changes. Using light and electron microscopic immunolocalization techniques, a series of 207 normal and pathologic human liver specimens were evaluated for the expression of alpha smooth muscle (SM) actin and desmin in this and other nonparenchymal cell types. In normal adult liver tissue, PSCs were practically devoid of desmin and exceptionally stained for alpha-SM actin, whereas this actin isoform frequently was encountered in PSCs from the embryonic to the adolescent period. A broad spectrum of pathologic conditions was accompanied by the presence of alpha-SM actin containing PSCs; these were detected preferentially in periportal or perivenular zones according to the predominant location of the underlying hepatocellular damage. The occurrence of this PSC phenotype generally was associated with fibrogenesis and was in some cases detected earlier than overt collagen accumulation. Fibrous bands subdividing liver tissue in cirrhosis and focal nodular hyperplasia, as well as desmoplastic reaction to malignant tumors, contained alpha-SM actin-rich cells admixed with variable proportions of cells coexpressing desmin. In end stages, this population was less numerous than in active fibrotic or cirrhotic processes. Using immunogold electron microscopy, alpha-SM actin was localized in microfilament bundles of typical PSCs. Our results are compatible with the assumption that the appearance of alpha-SM actin and desmin-expressing myofibroblasts results at least in part from a phenotypic modulation of PSCs.\r"

  ".W": "In addition to the glomerular lesions associated with Heymann nephritis, a rat model of human membranous nephritis, proximal tubule damage, and a perturbation of proximal tubule function also have been reported to occur in this disease. The aim of the present study was to examine in more detail the nature of the apical plasma membrane damage in proximal tubules using specific antibodies directed against clathrin, gp330, and a proton-pumping adenosine triphosphatase, all of which are components of the apical endocytotic apparatus of these epithelial cells. Immunocytochemical studies revealed a marked reduction in staining for all three antigens in proximal tubules from rats with active Heymann nephritis. Furthermore endocytotic uptake of intravenously injected FITC-dextran was considerably lower in diseased animals than in normal rats. Gp330 and rat IgG were identified as components of the luminal debris that accumulated during the course of Heymann nephritis. These results show that perturbation of proximal tubule endocytosis occurs in Heymann nephritis together with a loss of three apical antigens that are normally localized on membrane domains associated with the apical endocytotic pathway in these cells. The results also suggest that antibody-antigen complexes may be shed from the plasma membrane in both the glomerulus and the proximal tubule in this disease.\r"

  ".W": "The synthesis of collagen and EIIIA-containing cellular fibronectin in certain forms of pulmonary fibrosis occurs in discrete locations: in the Masson bodies in bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia and in focal clusters of fibroblasts (fibroblastic foci) within airspaces in usual interstitial pneumonia. These sites were examined by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against cytoskeletal markers and extracellular matrix components in biopsies from three patients with bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia and four patients with usual interstitial pneumonia. Fibroblasts of both Masson bodies and fibroblastic foci expressed vimentin and alpha smooth muscle actin but not desmin, distinguishing them from true smooth muscle. In both structures fibroblasts with well-formed actin filament bundles were aligned parallel to one another, enmeshed in a matrix of fibronectin-containing fibrils (microtendons) that linked cells and collagen bundles. Similar features characterize the phase of contraction during the healing of skin wounds. This suggests that active contractions of fibroblasts plays a role in the remodeling of the lung in pulmonary fibrosis.\r"

  ".U": "91221196\r", 
  ".W": "The presence of somatostatin receptors was investigated in 57 primary human ovarian tumors using in vitro receptor autoradiography with three different somatostatin radioligands, 125I-[Tyr11]-somatostatin-14, 125I-[Leu8, D-Trp22, Tyr25]-somatostatin-28, or 125I-[Tyr3]-SMS 201-995. Three cases, all belonging to epithelial tumors, were receptor positive; specifically 1 of 42 adenocarcinomas, 1 of 3 borderline malignancies, and 1 of 2 cystadenomas. Four other epithelial tumors (3 fibroadenomas, 1 Brenner tumor), 4 sex cord-stromal tumors (2 fibrothecomas, 2 granulosa cell tumors), and 2 germ cell tumors (1 dysgerminoma, 1 teratoma) were receptor negative. In the positive cases, the somatostatin receptors were localized on epithelial cells exclusively, were of high affinity (KD = 4.6 nmol/l [nanomolar]), and specific for somatostatin analogs. These receptors bound somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 radioligands with a higher affinity than the octapeptide [Tyr3]-SMS 201-995. Healthy ovarian tissue had no somatostatin receptors. A subpopulation of relatively well-differentiated ovarian tumors, therefore, was identified pathobiochemically on the basis of its somatostatin receptor content. This small group of somatostatin receptor-positive tumors may be a target for in vivo diagnostic imaging with somatostatin ligands.\r"

The nuclei of the control tumor cells contained 4.1 +/- 0.17 AgNOR granules. Treatment of rats for 8 weeks with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonist (D-Trp-6-LH-RH) and antagonist SB-75 induced a marked inhibition of tumor growth and decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) the number of Ag-NORs in the tumors to 2.89 +/- 0.10 AgNOR granules/cell in the group given the agonist and to 2.82 +/- 0.10 after therapy with the highest dose of the antagonist. A reduced AgNOR number (3.14 +/- 0.16) also was found after 3 days of treatment with SB-75 (P less than 0.05), but the AgNORs returned to near control values 1 week after the short-term therapy, showing the reversibility of these changes. These results suggest that the AgNOR method, which was widely tested on human tumors in the past few years, can be a valuable technique in experimental tumor pathology and useful in the evaluation of the effects of various treatments.\r"

  ".W": "To reveal the mechanism of the lesser infiltration of monocytes in synovial cavities with rheumatoid arthritis despite the presence of chronic inflammation, the synovial fluid from 15 rheumatoid arthritis patients was analyzed with respect to leukocyte chemotaxis. The synovial fluid possessed strong chemotactic activity to polymorphonuclear leukocytes but rather suppressed one to monocytes. The synovial fluid contained two different inhibitory activities in monocyte chemotaxis. One, which also suppressed polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, was identified as alpha 1 protease inhibitor. The other, with molecular weight of 8 kd, possessed the specificity to monocytes and shared the antigenicity with complement C4 but not with C3 or C5. A similar inhibitor was generated in normal human plasma when the classical pathway of the complement system was initiated with aggregated human IgG, while it was not when alternative pathway was initiated with zymosan. The small size factor in the synovial fluid, apparently derived from C4, seemed to be a cyto-directed factor that might block an early part of signal transduction system of monocytes in the chemotaxis. After removal of the small-size inhibitor, the synovial fluid exhibited chemotactic ability to monocytes. Therefore the apparent C4-derived factor might play a key role in the polymorphonuclear leukocyte-predominant infiltration in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

  ".W": "The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH; EC 1.2.1.3) activity was determined in samples of whole blood and in isolated erythrocytes and leukocytes from users of Swedish moist snuff, cigarette smokers and non-tobacco-using controls. The mean whole blood ALDH activity of the smokers was reduced by 21% (p less than 0.001) when compared to the controls, while that of the snuff users was reduced by only 8% (not significant). Similar but somewhat less pronounced differences were obtained both in the assays with erythrocytes and leukocytes. In the cigarette smokers, the whole blood activity correlated significantly (r = -0.79, p less than 0.001) with the plasma concentration of cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine, whereas no correlation was observed for the users of moist snuff. Similar plasma nicotine and cotinine levels were found in smokers and snuff users, which indicates that the reduced blood ALDH activity in smokers is not caused by nicotine or any of its metabolites, but more likely, by components formed during combustion of tobacco. Since a reduced blood ALDH activity has previously been suggested as an indicator of excessive alcohol consumption, the present results show that, in future studies on blood ALDH, the smoking habits should also be taken into account.\r"
