Survey responses were received from hospitals in 48 states. United States hospitals generated a median of 6.93 kg of hospital waste per patient per day and infectious waste made up 15% of the total hospital waste. Most hospitals (greater than 90%) considered blood, microbiology, \"sharps,\" communicable disease isolation, pathology, autopsy, and contaminated animal carcass waste as infectious. Other sources of hospital waste that were commonly (greater than 80%) designated infectious were surgical, dialysis, and miscellaneous laboratory waste. The infectious waste was normally (80%) treated via incineration or steam sterilization before disposal, whereas noninfectious waste was discarded directly in a sanitary landfill. Eight-two percent of these US hospitals are discarding blood, microbiology, sharps, pathology, and contaminated animal carcass waste in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control's recommendations, while the compliance rate for the Environmental Protection Agency's recommendations (excluding optional waste) is 75%. No hospital could identify an infection problem (excluding needle-stick injuries) that was attributable to the disposal of infectious waste. While the management of infectious waste by US hospitals is generally consistent with the Centers for Disease Control's guidelines, many hospitals employ overly inclusive definitions of infectious waste.\r"

The head was the site of 98 (68.5%) injuries. Peak hours for injuries were 11 AM and 4 PM, the peak day was Monday, and the peak season was summer. After adjustment for hours and dates of attendance, the rate was 1.77 injuries per 100,000 child-hours in day care; among preschool-aged children, infants had the lowest rate (0.77) and 2-year-old children had the highest rate (2.26). Almost 47% of injuries occurred on the playground; falls were involved in 70% of such injuries. Because 33% of all injuries resulted from falls on the playground, impact-absorbing playground surfaces may be a possible intervention to reduce injuries.\r"

Health care providers indicated that the kit was useful in more than 80% of emergencies and was occasionally lifesaving. In the emergencies in which the kit was used, 70% fell into one of seven major diagnostic groupings, including syncope/near syncope (29%), cardiac/chest pain (16%), asthma/lung disease/shortness of breath (10%), and allergic reactions (5%). With 450 million domestic air travelers per year, we would expect 3000 in-flight medical emergencies annually, and conclude that the enhanced medical kit is beneficial and propose that its effectiveness would be improved by the addition of a bronchodilator for inhalation.\r"

This resolution has prompted a Council on Scientific Affairs report on the current status of infectious hospital waste management and of state and federal regulations to control such waste. The Council has concluded that existing federal and state regulations for the management of hazardous waste--in conjunction with the accreditation program of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control, if adhered to and properly enforced--should be adequate to ensure that the public and environment are not endangered. Therefore, the Council does not favor additional federal legislation at this time and recommends that this report be accepted in lieu of Resolution 53.\r"

The present in vivo study examines one model of hyperkalemic dRTA, induced by chronic amiloride administration, to examine the relationship between urinary excretion of hydrogen and potassium ions and CCT PD in the rat kidney. Chronic administration of amiloride produced a significant metabolic acidosis with a plasma bicarbonate of 21.3 mmol/liter compared to 25.9 mmol/liter in control rats. Plasma potassium was higher in experimental animals (4.9 mmol/liter vs. 3.3 mmol/liter in controls) and was associated with a significantly reduced fractional excretion of potassium of 11.2% versus 37.4% in controls. When animals were loaded with DOCA and infused with 4% sodium sulphate to maximize urine acidification, urine pH was significantly higher in the experimental group (6.35 vs. 5.55 in controls) while the mean PD in cortical collecting tubules was markedly lower at -21.1 mV versus -58.9 mV in controls. These results support a voltage dependent mechanism to explain the defect in hydrogen and potassium ion secretion induced by amiloride.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a cytokine which is produced by mononuclear phagocytes upon activation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and various other stimuli. In immune-mediated glomerulonephritis, infiltration of glomeruli by monocytes-macrophages is associated with production of TNF. The purpose of the present experiments was to determine whether mesangial cells could also contribute to glomerular TNF synthesis. TNF activity has been determined in the culture medium of rat mesangial cells using a L-929 fibroblast lytic assay. This activity was detectable only when the cells were exposed to LPS (0.1 to 10 micrograms/ml) and for periods longer than one hour. The cytotoxic factor was identified as TNF since: (1) the lytic activity was completely inhibited by an anti-mouse TNF polyclonal antibody and was associated with suppression of lipoprotein lipase activity in adipocytes; (2) its molecular weight (110,000 daltons) corresponded to that observed for murine TNF under non-denaturing conditions; and (3) mRNA encoding TNF was expressed by mesangial cells two hours after addition of LPS. To assess the mechanisms whereby TNF production was regulated, the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was determined. LPS caused a dose-dependent increase of PGE2 synthesis by mesangial cells. Treatment by indomethacin promoted a suppression of PGE2 production together with an increase of TNF synthesis, indicating that PGE2 acted in a negative feedback manner to regulate the production of TNF. Addition of PGE2 (0.1 to 300 nM) or 8-bromo cyclic AMP (0.1 to 100 microM) induced similar dose-dependent reductions of TNF synthesis. Thus the inhibitory effect of PGE2 probably required in part cyclic AMP accumulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Aluminum-induced osteomalacia is a frequent complication observed in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. However, it is not known whether there are direct effects of aluminum on osteoblasts, or alternatively, whether the observed changes are due to changes in PTH or other factors. We sought to determine the effect of micromolar levels of aluminum on osteoblasts using a well-defined cell line derived from a 32P induced osteosarcoma of rat, UMR 106-01, which is alkaline-phosphatase positive, responds to PTH, and synthesizes type I collagen. Aluminum exposure was controlled using tissue culture media with [Al ] less than 1 microgram/liter (40 nM), produced by precipitation of aluminum salts at pH 8.5. The effect of defined [Al ], from 20 to 800 micrograms/liter (0.7 to 30 microM), was then determined by adding back aluminum while measuring DNA and protein synthesis. We found that aluminum depressed DNA synthesis, as determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation, by 60%, with half maximal effect at 20 micrograms/liter (740 nM) in cells at a density of 20,000/cm2. Alternatively, protein synthesis, as determined by 3H-leucine incorporation, did not decline, and in some cases increased. However, qualitative analysis of matrix proteins produced with and without 800 micrograms/liter (30 mM) [Al ] showed no differences. Direct measurements of cell number and protein synthesis confirmed these findings. Al does not alter the PTH-induced cAMP response of these cells. Thus, aluminum has a direct effect on cell division, and probably on protein synthesis, in this osteoblast-like cell line. These effects occur at levels of aluminum below those commonly contaminating tissue culture media, and thus are seen reproducibly only in media of defined [Al ].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The autoregulatory ability of the renal vascular system in the split hydronephrotic kidney was quantitated with intravital microscopy. The luminal diameters of the arcuate and interlobular arteries as well as the afferent and efferent arterioles were measured. Glomerular blood flow was determined by the dual slit technique. In the first series of experiments, the renal perfusion pressure was reduced by graded clamping of the abdominal aorta. Pressure reduction from 118 mm Hg to 95 mm Hg induced dilation of all preglomerular vessels except for the distal afferent arteriole; there was no change in the efferent arteriole and the blood flow was maintained. Further pressure reductions to 71 and 43 mm Hg caused additional dilations of the preglomerular vessels, a marginal reduction in diameter of proximal efferent arterioles and flow reductions by 15% and 41%, respectively. In the second series, systemic blood pressure was increased by continuous i.v. infusions of norepinephrine (NE). NE constricted pre- and postglomerular vessels except for the distal afferent arteriole; glomerular flow was decreased. Reduction of renal perfusion pressure during NE infusion to the preinfusion value did not diminish glomerular blood flow, but reduced the constrictor response to NE in preglomerular vessels. In a third series of experiments we examined the effect of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) on renal autoregulation. Addition of ANF (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) to the renal bath induced a dose-dependent dilation of all preglomerular vessels and a constriction of the efferent arteriole. Pressure reduction from 120 to 95 mm Hg resulted in a further preglomerular vasodilation. These experiments demonstrate that autoregulation is mediated primarily by diameter changes in all preglomerular vessels excluding the distal segment of the afferent arteriole. Further, these data suggest that ANF induced dilation of preglomerular vessels does not impair the myogenic response of these vessels.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperlipidemia may contribute to the pathogenesis of glomerular sclerosis. We therefore studied binding and uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) by cultured rat mesangial cells. In addition effects of LDL on PGE2 synthesis and cell proliferation were determined. At 4 degrees C mesangial cells bound [125I] LDL in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with half-maximal binding observed at 5 micrograms/ml of LDL protein. Binding was blocked by excess unlabeled LDL and by heparin. Uptake (binding plus internalization) of LDL at 37 degrees C markedly exceeded binding at 4 degrees C, continued to increase even with longer periods of incubation, and showed no saturability, consistent with uptake of LDL by mesangial cells. Further evidence for LDL uptake by mesangial cells was obtained by use of the fluorescent probe 1,1'-dioactadecyl-3,3,3', 3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate-labeled LDL (Dil-LDL). Incubation of mesangial cells with Dil-LDL at 37 degrees C showed positive fluorescence for all mesangial cells, indicating uptake of the Dil-LDL. LDL had a biphasic effect on mesangial cell proliferation as determined by [3H] thymidine incorporation. LDL at 10 micrograms/ml enhanced [3H] thymidine uptake modestly, but significantly, whereas a progressive and marked inhibition occurred at LDL concentration from 100 to 500 micrograms/ml. While LDL at 10 and 100 micrograms/ml significantly stimulated PGE2 production, inhibition of PGE2 by meclofenamate did not influence the effects of LDL on [3H] thymidine incorporation. We conclude that mesangial cells show specific binding and uptake of LDL and that high concentrations of LDL markedly decrease mesangial cell proliferation. These findings may pertain to the pathogenesis of glomerular lesions in hyperlipidemia of renal disease.\r"

Sprague-Dawley rats were uninephrectomized and given daily injections of cyclosporine (30 mg/kg, i.m.) or vehicle (olive oil), and studied 7 or 14 days later. In cyclosporine treated rats GFR was lower seven days (1.34 +/- 0.10 vs. 1.68 +/- 0.07 ml/min) and 14 days (1.19 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.58 +/- 0.04, P less than 0.025) following uninephrectomy. Arterial blood pressure, cardiac output and renal blood flow (RBF) were not different in cyclosporine and control rats. Kidney mass increased to the same extent in cyclosporine and control rats. Micropuncture of the glomerular microcirculation in similarly prepared Munich-Wistar rats demonstrated low whole kidney GFR (1.10 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.55 +/- 0.13 ml/min, P less than 0.01), and single nephron GFR (31.07 +/- 2.27 vs. 42.36 +/- 2.47 nl/min, P less than 0.005) in cyclosporine treated rats as compared to controls. Single nephron plasma flow, afferent and efferent arteriolar resistance, the transglomerular hydrostatic pressure gradient, and arterial blood pressure were the same in both groups. The glomerular capillary ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) was lower in cyclosporine treated rats compared to controls [0.039 +/- 0.002 vs. 0.075 +/- 0.013 nl/(sec.mm Hg), P less than 0.025]. We conclude that in this model of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity the low GFR is caused solely by a reduction in Kf, and that cyclosporine can reduce GFR without causing renal vasoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "This prospective cross-over study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 1% amino acid dialysis solution on the nutritional and metabolic changes, plasma amino acid profiles and peritoneal membrane function of patients on CAPD. Six CAPD patients had one exchange a day with two liters of this solution over a six month period. Every month there was a medical examination, anthropometric measurements and dietary inquiry were made, blood biochemistry tests were done. Every three months renal function, peritoneal function, aminograms of plasma and dialysate and nitrogen balance were determined. Data were compared with those obtained one month prior to and three months after withdrawal of amino acid administration. Nitrogen balance, which was negative (-1.3 g/day) became positive (+3.1 g/day). Patients who were already overweight increased in weight, both in fat and lean mass. Plasma cholesterol and triglycerides significantly decreased and the amino acid profile moved towards normal; plasma urea levels increased and pH and bicarbonate decreased slightly but significantly (P less than 0.05). Plasma protein concentrations did not change. All the above parameters turned towards basal values when amino acids were discontinued. We conclude that amino acids can be used as osmotic agents for CAPD since they do not cause toxic effects or impair peritoneal membrane function. Moreover, they can help the nutritional status, provided that an increase in weight is prevented and the slight worsening of systemic acidosis is corrected.\r"

  ".W": "Free amino acids (AA) were determined in plasma and in muscle tissue of 29 patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 2 to 38 months. Muscle biopsies were taken in the morning after an overnight dwell with 1.36% glucose dialysis fluid. Muscle intracellular water was calculated using the chloride method. The intracellular (ic) and extracellular (ec) concentration and the ic/ec gradient for each AA was calculated and compared with values in matched healthy controls. Most of the essential and several non-essential AA were low in plasma. By contrast, none of the essential AA were low in muscle, and methionine was increased as were ornithine, asparagine, and aspartic acid; however, muscle taurine was markedly reduced. The ic/ec gradient was increased for most essential and several non-essential AA. In plasma, taurine precursors, methionine and cysteine, were not reduced and the ratios taurine/cysteine and taurine/methionine were low. Muscle taurine/methionine was also low. Thus, during CAPD muscle free AA are, in general, well maintained, suggesting that marked reductions of plasma AA levels in CAPD patients may reflect an ec to ic shift rather than depletion. The finding of low muscle taurine, but normal or increased cysteine and methionine pools, suggests that taurine depletion during CAPD is caused by blocked synthesis or low intake of taurine.\r"

Based on results obtained from these calculations and taking lymphatic drainage into account, transport from peritoneal cavity to the blood was also simulated. With respect to solute transport the data were compatible with a functional blood-peritoneal barrier consisting of a two-pore membrane containing a large number of paracellular \"small pores\" of radius 40 to 55 A and a small number of \"large pores\" of radius 200 to 300 A. Solutes smaller than 25 A in radius were found to be permeating across the peritoneal membrane mainly by means of diffusion across the small pores, whereas solutes larger than 40 A were calculated to reach the peritoneal cavity exclusively by unidirectional convection across the large pores. In addition, water was simulated to be transported through transcellular \"ultrapores\" (radius less than 8 A) not accessible to hydrophilic solute permeation. Small solute absorption from the peritoneal cavity was found to occur by diffusion across small pores. Molecules larger than 25 to 30 A in radius (molecular weight above 25,000) were simulated to be absorbed from the peritoneal cavity exclusively via non-size-selective lymphatic drainage.\r"

We have examined glomerular hemodynamics, SNGFR and histologic changes after renal ischemia and two hours of reperfusion in untreated (I) rats and rats pretreated with the antioxidant, probucol (IP). SNGFR decreased significantly by 47% in I rats. Reduction in SNGFR was primarily the result of a major decrease in the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure gradient, delta P, and a decrease in nephron plasma flow (SNPF). The glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient remained equal to control valves. In IP rats SNGFR was improved to values 89% of control rats due to higher values of delta P and SNPF. Histologic evidence of modest damage to cells of the proximal tubule was equal in both untreated and probucol treated ischemic animals. These studies demonstrate that: (a) primary reductions in nephron filtration rate at the glomerulus result from decreases in delta P and nephron plasma flow; b) pretreatment with the antioxidant, probucol, increases nephron plasma flow and SNGFR, and maintains more normal values for delta P; and c) tubular damage was equivalent in I and IP rats in spite of differences in SNGFR.\r"

We have shown previously that the Na+-independent D-glucose transporter of the rabbit renal proximal tubular cell is localized exclusively in the basolateral membrane. To determine whether cytochalasin B binds to this renal transporter we measured binding of [3H]cytochalasin B to proximal tubular basolateral membranes isolated from rabbit kidneys. A steady state of binding is reached by 15 minutes at 20 degrees C over a concentration range of 0.01 to 50 microM. Non-linear regression analysis of cytochalasin B binding from 0.01 to 20 microM plotted according to Scatchard reveals two classes of binding sites with Kd 5.88 x 10(-8) M, Bmax 16.1 pmol/mg protein; and Kd 5.62 x 10(-5) M, Bmax 2816 pmol/mg protein. [3H]cytochalasin B (0.1 microM) binding to basolateral membranes is a reversible process; it is displacable by excess unlabeled cytochalasin B with a time course similar to binding of [3H]cytochalasin B. Binding of [3H]cytochalasin B is inhibited by 500 mM D-glucose (21%), 2-deoxy-D-glucose (57%) and 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (64%), but not by L-glucose. [3H]cytochalasin B binding is reduced 71% by 0.1 mM phloretin, but only 26% by 0.1 mM phlorizin. Such substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity are similar to those previously demonstrated in non-renal tissues by others as well as in rabbit renal proximal tubular basolateral membranes by us. Our data suggest that cytochalasin B binds to the Na+-independent D-glucose transporter or a component of the transporter in the renal proximal tubular basolateral membrane.\r"

Furthermore, we have studied, using selective agonists and antagonists for adenosine, which kind of adenosine receptor, A1 or A2, is mainly implicated in this response. We also investigated whether calcium is involved in adenosine-induced mesangial cell contraction. Rat cultured mesangial cells were exposed to adenosine (10(-7) to 10(-3) M) and the contraction was measured as changes in planar cell surface area (PCSA). Adenosine induced a time- and dose-dependent reduction of PCSA. This reduction in PCSA was prevented by incubation with the A1 blocker PD116,948 but not with the A2 blocker PD115,199. Adenosine-5'-ethylcarboxamide (NECA), an A2 agonist, did not induce significant changes in PCSA whereas N6-S-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl adenosine (S-PIA), an A1 agonist, induced a dose-dependent decrease in PCSA. Adenosine-induced mesangial contraction was prevented by verapamil or by incubation in a calcium-free medium. These results suggest that adenosine induces a specific contraction of cultured rat mesangial cells that seems to be mediated by its binding to the adenosine A1-type receptor. This contraction seems to be dependent on the influx of extracellular calcium.\r"

The obstructed kidney undergoes cellular atrophy following an initial phase of interstitial proliferation while the contralateral kidney hypertrophies. To evaluate the molecular events occurring in both kidneys after obstruction, we examined the expression of growth related (c-fos, c-myc, cH-ras, HSP 70), cell maintenance (beta-actin), and cellular damage (TRPM-2) genes at the mRNA level. In the contralateral kidney an early and transitory induction of c-fos and c-myc expression occurred while a bimodal induction was noted in the obstructed kidney. The patterns of cH-ras, HSP 70 and actin expression also differed in both kidneys. Induction of TRPM-2 was noted only in the obstructed kidney. Rapid gene activation is evident in both the contralateral and obstructed kidney following unilateral ureteral obstruction. The patterns of expression are distinct and may reflect the cellular response to stress (cell death and stromal proliferation) in the obstructed kidney versus a response to a systemic stimulus resulting in cellular hypertrophy in the contralateral kidney.\r"

A rat tissue kallikrein cDNA probe, 534 bases in length and complementary to the 3' end of kallikrein mRNA was first used in Northern blot analysis to demonstrate the existence of tissue kallikrein mRNA in rat kidney. Then, kallikrein mRNA's localization in rat kidney sections was studied in situ hybridization histochemistry using the same probe. Positive signals were concentrated in the renal cortex at the vascular pole of the glomeruli and to a lesser degree, the distal tubular cells. Prehybridization with the unlabeled probe can abolish the positive signal; the same result can also be achieved by pretreatment of the tissue section with ribonuclease. By using the same technique, tissue kallikrein mRNA was also localized in granular convoluted tubule and striated duct cells of rat submandibular gland. The results suggest a new site of renal kallikrein synthesis at the vascular pole of the glomerulus. These findings, coupled with the previous studies that tissue kallikrein can participate in activation and releasing of renin, raise a potential physiological role of kallikrein in renin release or prorenin processing at juxtaglomerular cells.\r"

Each child had an elevated serum ferritin level, a dense liver as measured by computerized tomography (Hounsfield Units) and one had dialysis related porphyria cutanea tarda. Deferoxamine therapy (10 to 17.5 mg/kg) was given in the overnight exchange for three to six months. Prior to therapy, iron was not detected in the dialysate; during the course of therapy, daily dialysate iron removal averaged 5652 micrograms, 2241 micrograms and 4028 micrograms in the three children. The serum ferritin level fell during the course of therapy in two children who were estimated to be in negative iron balance, and was unchanged in the third who was estimated to be in positive iron balance due to frequent transfusions. In 10 children with chronic renal failure, there was a linear correlation (r = 0.855; P less than 0.01) between the serum ferritin and the liver density, suggesting that an increased serum ferritin correlates with hepatic iron content. Interestingly, in each of the three children who received deferoxamine therapy, the liver density increased during therapy regardless of the estimated iron balance and the change in the serum ferritin level. We conclude that intraperitoneal deferoxamine therapy results in substantial iron losses in peritoneal dialysate, can result in negative iron balance but, in this study, did not result in lower liver iron content as measured by density on computerized tomography scan.\r"

To determine if the lesions of HIV-associated nephropathy have morphologic specificity, a subgroup of 13 biopsies with a diagnosis of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVN) were compared to 13 biopsies each of heroin-associated nephropathy (HAN) and of idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (IFSGS) matched for patient age, proteinuria and serum creatinine. A diagnosis of HIVN was made in 1 of 30 (3.3%) AIDS autopsies and 26 of 34 (76.5%) renal biopsies. When compared to HAN and IFSGS, HIVN had more globally \"collapsed\" glomeruli (P less than 0.001), less glomerular hyalinosis (P less than 0.02), more severe visceral epithelial cell swelling (P less than 0.05), more numerous visceral epithelial cell droplets (P less than 0.002), more prevalent and severe tubular microcystic dilatation (P less than 0.02), and tubular cell degenerative changes (P less than 0.001). Focal glomerular electron-dense deposits were present in 14 of 26 cases. Tubuloreticular inclusions were extremely numerous in glomerular and interstitial capillary endothelial cells as well as in interstitial leukocytes (P less than 0.001). Granular degeneration of nuclear chromatin was present in 10 of 26 cases. Nuclear bodies were more numerous in tubular and interstitial cells of HIVN (P less than 0.01), particularly type 3 (P less than 0.001). Reversal of tissue T4/T8 ratio was observed. We conclude that while no single morphologic feature of HIVN is specific, the combination of clinical and pathologic findings is quite distinctive and permits a presumptive diagnosis of HIVN in otherwise asymptomatic carriers.\r"

  ".W": "We used an in vitro model, MDCK cyst, to determine the extent to which pharmacologic compounds known to inhibit plasma membrane solute transport mechanisms could alter the enlargement of renal epithelial cysts. Solitary MDCK cells cultured within collagen gel undergo clonal growth to form true epithelial cysts in which a single layer of polarized cells (apex toward lumen) encloses a fluid-filled cavity. Repeated observations by light microscopy were used to quantitate the rate of cyst growth in diameter, and demonstrated that cyst enlargement involved an increase in cell number (proliferation) and a net increase in intracystic volume (fluid secretion). Intracyst pressure was greater than the interstitium (6.7 mm H2O +/- 3.1 SD), indicating that fluid entry was secondary to net solute accumulation. Amiloride and seven amiloride analogs that inhibited to different degrees conductive Na+ transport, Na+-dependent H+ transport and Na+-dependent Ca++ transport reversibly decreased the rate of cyst enlargement. The effectiveness of these agents to retard cyst enlargement correlated with their relative potencies to inhibit Na+-dependent Ca++ transport. Morphologic examination indicated that amiloride and amiloride analogs decreased cell proliferation and fluid secretion to the same degree. Ouabain and vanadate (Na+K,ATPase inhibitors), and L-645,695 (Na+-dependent Cl-/HCO3- inhibitor) potently slowed cyst expansion. In contrast to amiloride and amiloride analogs, these agents caused an unusual degree of cellular stratification within the cyst walls, a finding consistent with the notion that fluid secretion was inhibited to a greater extent then cellular proliferation. We conclude that chemical inhibitors of primary and secondary active solute transport can diminish or halt the enlargement of epithelial cysts in vitro by decreasing the rate of cellular proliferation and/or net fluid secretion.\r"

In 9 all identifiable parathyroid tissue in the neck was deliberately removed, and in the tenth (operated 14 years ago) the remnant which had been left probably did not function. Their post-operative course resembled that of patients treated conventionally, and their subsequent course was likewise uneventful with disappearance of all symptoms associated with their osteodystrophy. All patients required oral calcium supplementation but none were given vitamin D compounds after the initial period of repletion following surgery. Mean serum values were (before PTX and current) for calcium 2.63 +/- 0.14 and 2.33 +/- 0.08 mmol/liter, P = NS, for phosphorus 1.96 +/- 0.13 and 1.38 +/- 0.09 mmol/liter, P less than 0.01, and for alkaline phosphatase 713 +/- 191 and 101 +/- 14 IU, P less than 0.05. Evidence for residual parathyroid tissue was present in each case; one patient remained mildly hyperparathyroid and several were mildly hypoparathyroid by the IRMA PTH assay. Bone histomorphometry in five subjects post-PTX showed either normal or low turnover. Radiologically, striking remineralization was seen with disappearance of all erosive changes. We suggest that residual areas of parathyroid tissue are stimulated and continue to secrete hormone even when all the discrete glands have been removed. It is recommended that when indicated, and in the absence of aluminum excess, total PTX without autotransplant should be the preferred form of therapy for long-term dialysis patients.\r"

In the sera of patients with primary IgA nephropathy the relative contribution of IgA1 polymers to total IgA1 was also similar to controls. These results indicate that in IgA nephropathy, the increased IgA production in the bone marrow is restricted to the IgA1 subclass. The production of both monomeric and polymeric IgA1 is increased in patients during a quiescent phase of the disease.\r"

Twenty-six tumors were diploid, and 50 tumors were aneuploid. There was no correlation among DNA ploidy and histologic type, lymph-node status, wall invasion, or clinical stage. The incidence of vascular invasion in the aneuploid tumors was significantly higher than that in the diploid tumors. Five year survival was achieved in 28% of the patients with diploid tumors and 8% of those with aneuploid tumors, respectively. Among the patients undergoing curative resection, 5 year survival rate was 54% in the patients with diploid tumors compared to 28% with aneuploid tumors. There was a significant survival advantage in patients with diploid tumors. These results indicate that DNA ploidy might be an important prognostic factor in Borrmann type 4 gastric carcinomas.\r"

By solid-phase RIA with purified CEA and its related antigens, NCC-CO-413 (IgG2a, kappa) was shown to react with NCA and BGP-I as well as with CEA, whereas the reactivities of three other MoAbs, NCC-CO-308 (IgG1, kappa), -432 (IgG1 lambda), and -411 (IgG1, kappa) were limited to CEA. Immunohistochemical reactivities of these MoAbs to colonic carcinomas, granulocytes, and liver bile canaliculi on acetone-fixed paraffin-embedded sections (\"AMeX\" sections) confirmed the specificities of these MoAbs shown by the solid-phase RIA. By competition solid-phase RIA, the epitopes recognized by NCC-CO-308 and -432 were shown to be shared or located close to each other, whereas the other MoAbs were shown to recognize different epitopes. Thus, two epitopes specific to CEA and one shared by NCA and BGP-I as well as CEA were identified. Furthermore, reactivities of MoAbs with the two CEA-specific epitopes were easily abolished by heat denaturation or reduction of CEA, as revealed by solid-phase RIA and SDS-PAGE-immunoblotting, indicating that these two CEA-specific epitopes are based on the conformational structure of the CEA molecule.\r"

Analysis of the data shows no significant difference from an oncological standpoint between radical and conservative surgery when a radical dissection is performed. Elective nodal dissections for malignant melanoma of the head and neck region, like those at other sites of lymphatic drainage such as the groin and axilla, did not prove beneficial. We do recommend parotidectomy in cases where the primary tumor arises in the superior area of the head. The number of nodes involved and the type of disease spread constitute the major prognostic factors, as in the case of melanomas located in other sites. Our data further indicate that the incidence of distant and local recurrence is not influenced by the type of dissection performed.\r"

The animals were sacrificed after therapy according to a different schedule for each type of tumor. The morphology of the neoplasia in every group of treated tumors was compared with that of the control group. For quantitative evaluation of the necrosis, we studied the ratio of the tumor necrotic areas (N) to a tumor standard area (T). From the results obtained, the following conclusions were made: 1) Necrosis produced by combined treatment was significantly greater than that obtained by using one only; 2) necrosis appeared early after treatment and remained relatively unchanged; 3) The damaging effect of the hyperthermia occurred earlier than that produced by radiotherapy when these methods were used separately, thus suggesting distinct mechanisms of tumor necrosis.\r"

These techniques allow for a high-dose delivery to the tumor bed with minimal normal tissue toxicity. A relatively simple and accurate method is described using I-125 seeds in Vicryl suture threaded through Gelfoam. These permanent implant procedures with radioactive I-125 seeds effectively treat small residual tumors or suspicious margins where standard brachytherapy techniques may be unsatisfactory and technically difficult to perform.\r"

  ".W": "Despite 25 years of research in lung transplantation, little progress has been made in methods for improving lung preservation. To evaluate many factors that may affect lung function after preservation, we have developed a simple, reliable, and inexpensive animal model. This consists of an isolated rabbit lung preparation perfused with blood and ventilated with a closed-circuit system. Heart-lung blocks were harvested and the left lung was assessed after ligation of the right pulmonary artery and right main-stem bronchus. On completion of a storage period, the left lung was ventilated and perfused with fresh rabbit venous blood at a rate of 40 ml/min for 10 minutes. Assessment of lung function included gas analysis of infused and effluent blood, oxygen uptake, mean pulmonary artery perfusion pressure, and mean airway pressure. A control group and six preservation groups were evaluated, each with different storage temperatures (38 degrees C, 34 degrees C, 23 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 10 degrees C, and 4 degrees C). For each temperature, ischemic periods ranging from 1 to 30 hours were studied. In the control group, the lungs were assessed immediately after being harvested. In the preservation groups, the lungs were kept partially inflated, stored at a predetermined temperature by immersion, and later assessed after variable ischemic periods. Our studies demonstrated the following: (1) The degree of impaired lung function produced by ischemia is reflected by a decrease in oxygen uptake and in oxygen tension of the effluent pulmonary venous blood and an increase in pulmonary artery perfusion pressure; (2) hypothermia improves ischemic tolerance; (3) preservation of lung at 10 degrees C is superior to preservation at 15 degrees C and 4 degrees C. This screening model has allowed evaluation of independent multiple factors and methods pertinent to lung preservation and enables one to assess lung function reliably and rapidly.\r"

  ".U": "89363510\r", 
  ".W": "Several investigations have indicated that rupture of the thoracic aorta is one of the leading causes of immediate death in victims of road traffic accidents. In Finland in 1983, 92% of front-seat passengers were seat belt wearers on highways and 82% in build-up areas. The mechanisms of rupture of the aorta have been intensively investigated, but the relationship between seat belt wearing and injury mechanisms leading to aortic rupture is still largely unknown. This study comprises 4169 fatally injured victims investigated by the Boards of Traffic Accident Investigation of Insurance Companies during the period 1972 to 1985. Chest injuries were recorded as the main cause of death in 1121 (26.9%) victims, 207 (5.0%) of those victims having worn a seat belt. Aortic ruptures were found at autopsy in 98 victims and the exact information of the location of the aortic tears was available in 68. For a control group, we analyzed 72 randomly chosen unbelted victims who had a fatal aortic rupture in similar accidents. The location of the aortic rupture in unbelted victims was more often in the ascending aorta, especially in drivers, whereas in seat belt wearers the distal descending aorta was statistically more often ruptured, especially in right-front passengers (p less than 0.05). The steering wheel predominated statistically as the part of the car estimated to have caused the injury in unbelted victims (37/72), and some interior part of the car was the most common cause of fatal thoracic impacts in seat belt wearers (48/68) (p less than 0.001). The mechanism of rupture of the aorta in the classic site just distal to the subclavian artery seems to be rapid deceleration, although complex body movements are also responsible in side impact collisions. The main mechanism leading to rupture of the ascending aorta seems to be severe blow to the bony thorax. This also often causes associated thoracic injuries, such as heart rupture and sternal fracture. Injuries in the ascending aorta were mostly found in unbelted victims and were sustained in frontal impact collisions, the injury-causing part of the car being the steering wheel. Ruptures of the distal descending part of the aorta were frequently associated with fractures of the thoracic vertebra.\r"

The second part shows a wide variation in the architecture of valves having two leaflets. Having produced criteria for the number of sinuses and the number of leaflets, we discovered that previous criteria used in the definition of valves with two leaflets are inadequate when the whole valvular complex is considered. Only seven valves in the study have two leaflets supported by two sinuses. The evidence points to the other valves having started with three leaflets but becoming bicuspid during either intrauterine or postnatal life.\r"

  ".U": "89363512\r", 
  ".W": "The early natural history of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion was studied in 35 open-chest anesthetized dogs observed for 6 hours. Six control dogs underwent isolation of the left anterior descending without occlusion, 13 underwent isolated occlusion of the artery to simulate single-vessel disease, and 14 underwent occlusion of the left anterior descending and 50% stenosis of the circumflex coronary artery to simulate multivessel disease. Regional systolic shortening was measured by ultrasonic crystals. Control dogs had a mild fall in cardiac output (27%) and rise in aortic pressure (15 mm Hg). Ischemia produced immediate dyskinesia (-60% of control systolic shortening), and passive lengthening persisted for 6 hours. All dogs with only occlusion of the left anterior descending artery survived (0% mortality). They were less prone to ventricular fibrillation (46% versus 79%, p less than 0.05), developed compensatory hypercontractility of remote muscle (131% of control systolic shortening, p less than 0.05), mild energy and substrate depletion, and anaerobic metabolism (increased glucose-6-phosphate, p less than 0.05) despite maintenance of \"normal\" blood flow. In contrast, the early mortality rate was 57% (p less than 0.05) when 50% circumflex stenosis coexisted. Intractable ventricular fibrillation and/or cardiogenic shock caused the deaths. Remote muscle became progressively hypocontractile (61% of control systolic shortening, p less than 0.05), with progressive reduction in stroke work index (less than 0.5 gm-m/kg, p less than 0.05). Remote muscle showed moderate substrate and energy depletion (greater than 60% fall of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate, 37% fall of glutamate) and more pronounced evidence of anaerobic metabolism (glucose-6-phosphate rose greater than 400%, p less than 0.05) despite normal blood flow. Mitochondrial ultrastructure and function remained intact in all hearts. These findings suggest that remote muscle is the principal determinant of mortality after an otherwise nonlethal ischemic event. Functional deterioration despite normal blood flow to remote muscle suggests either autoregulatory failure or substrate depletion as a cause of hypocontractility. The structural and functional integrity of mitochondria in ischemic and remote myocardium implies that salvage is possible despite hemodynamic deterioration and intractable ventricular fibrillation.\r"

The measurements were made just before the operation, 5 minutes after removal of the aortic crossclamp, and 24 hours after the operation. Endotoxin was quantitated by a combination of a sensitive Limulus amebocyte lysate assay and rocket immunoelectrophoresis measuring picogram amounts of endotoxin. Peripheral blood neutrophils were purified by a two-step dextran sedimentation and metrizoate sodium Ficoll (Lymphoprep., Nyegaard, Oslo, Norway) centrifugation. The oxidative burst response of these cells was measured for their ability to generate superoxide anion and was determined by a cytochrome c reduction assay. Preoperatively, all the plasma samples except one were free of endotoxin. The endotoxin levels reached 100 pg/ml 5 minutes after removal of the aortic crossclamp, and except in one sample they had decreased 24 hours after the operation. Studies on the generation of superoxide by neutrophils showed a decline in the response 5 minutes after removal of the aortic crossclamp and an enhancement of the response to f-Met-Leu-Phe by cells obtained from 11 of 12 patients 24 hours postoperatively. In vitro addition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide to blood from healthy individuals also enhanced the superoxide response of the neutrophils. We conclude that during cardiopulmonary bypass the circulating blood is contaminated by endotoxin and the neutrophils are primed for enhanced generation of oxygen radicals. The released oxygen radicals may be involved in the tissue damage observed in these patients.\r"

The 25 dogs (36 +/- 12 kg) were perfused after cavo-aortic cannulation for 6 hours with a mean flow of 100 ml/kg body weight. At the end of perfusion without systemic heparin, heparin-coated equipment was replaced in three animals with standard uncoated equipment for control studies. Besides continuous hemodynamic evaluation with Mikro-Tip pressure transducers (Millar Instruments, Inc., Houston, Texas), a standard battery of analyses was performed before, after mixing, and every 30 minutes during bypass. All animals could be perfused in accordance with the protocol. Blood-gas values (pH, arterial oxygen tension, and arterial carbon dioxide tension) were maintained within physiologic ranges for all groups. After 6 hours of perfusion, plasma hemoglobin levels were as follows: 0.57 +/- 0.51 gm/L for COATED HFMO without systemic heparinization versus 2.65 +/- 1.02 gm/L for HFMO (p less than 0.05), 1.77 +/- 0.48 gm/L for IHFMO (p less than 0.05), 1.96 +/- 0.41 gm/L for PLATE O (p less than 0.05), and 1.5 +/- 0.40 gm/L for BUBBLE O (p less than 0.05) with systemic heparinization. Platelet levels were highest for COATED HFMO with 47% +/- 36% without systemic heparinization versus 33% +/- 9% for HFMO, 12% +/- 2% for IHFMO, 36% +/- 17% for PLATE O, and 19% +/- 12% for BUBBLE O with systemic heparinization. Activated clotting time for COATED HFMO without systemic heparinization was 135 +/- 75 seconds before bypass, 207 +/- 21 seconds after mixing, and 131 +/- 20 seconds after 4 hours of perfusion. There was no statistically significant increase of plasma heparin levels in the group perfused without systemic heparin. Determination of fibrin split products during perfusion without systemic heparinization did not show a significant increase. At the end of perfusion all devices were disconnected and gently rinsed with saline: There were no macroscopic clots in the COATED HFMO group perfused without systemic heparin. However, uncoated equipment introduced for control in animals perfused without systemic heparin showed major clotting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "After prolonged exposure to low temperatures (1 degree and 4 degrees C), human atrial trabeculae show poor recovery of contraction. At somewhat higher temperatures (12 degrees and 20 degrees C), recovery is much better (Keon and associates. Ann Thorac Surg 1988;46:337-41). Although better preservation of adenosine triphosphate and therefore improved contractile recovery might be expected after exposure to lower temperatures, it remained possible that, below a certain temperature, adenosine triphosphate-generating mechanisms could be slowed more than adenosine triphosphate utilization. To investigate this phenomenon further, we followed the time course of metabolic changes in human atrial appendages, harvested during cardiac bypass operations, at 1 degree, 4 degrees, 12 degrees, and 20 degrees C using high-resolution 31P and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results are quantitated by correlation with data obtained from biochemical assays on quick-frozen tissues. Initial adenosine triphosphate levels in myocytes of human atrial appendages are 3.3 to 4.3 mumol.gm-1 tissue wet weight. At 20 degrees C, adenosine triphosphate disappears after 6 hours; at 12 degrees C, about half the initial adenosine triphosphate is still observable at this time; at 4 degrees C or 1 degree C, the decline is still slower. Only a small contribution toward adenosine triphosphate maintenance comes from creatine phosphate, since creatine phosphate, inorganic phosphate, and total creatine levels in the appendage are low (less than 2 mumol.gm-1 tissue wet weight). Glycolysis is active at all temperatures; the rate of glycolysis correlates positively with increasing temperature. Adenosine triphosphate generated by glycolysis falls just short of demand at all temperatures, but the difference is small at 1 degree and 4 degrees C. These studies lead us to conclude that the relatively poor recovery of contractile response of human atrial trabeculae, together with contracture reported previously at lower temperatures (1 degree and 4 degrees C), is not due to a failure to maintain adenosine triphosphate levels.\r"

  ".W": "The autoperfused working heart-lung preparation has been used for extended cardiopulmonary preservation for transplantation. However, acute lung injury and failure of the preparation can result from pulmonary hypertension, which previous investigators have linked to denervation. We studied the neural and vasoactive mediators of pulmonary vasoconstriction during normothermic autoperfusion of the heart and lungs from 13 calves. Pulmonary vascular resistance was quantitated by multipoint pulmonary artery pressure/flow plots generated by incremental reduction in venous return at three times: A, after sternotomy but before autoperfusion (control); B, during in situ autoperfusion (innervated heart-lung preparation); and C, after explanation (denervated heart-lung preparation). During hemodynamic measurements, left atrial blood samples were obtained for measurement of thromboxane B2, 6-keto-prostaglandin-F1 alpha, and complement activation products C3a and C5a. Results show that pulmonary hypertension in the autoperfused working heart-lung preparation begins during autoperfusion before denervation and may be related to complement activation and to increased levels of circulating thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (both the absolute levels and the ratio of thromboxane B2 to 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha). After denervation, both prostaglandin intermediates were markedly increased, but their ratio was not significantly affected. These data suggest that there is an initial stage of pulmonary vasoconstriction at the onset of autoperfusion that is accompanied by increased circulating levels of vasoactive mediators and that denervation further contributes to this response.\r"

In 15 patients who had severe aortic stenosis and a contraindication to aortic valve replacement, PABV was performed before a noncardiac procedure, in an attempt to improve their hemodynamics and reduce the risks associated with the operation or preoperative diagnostic test. The mean aortic gradient was reduced from 58.1 +/- 6.0 mm Hg to 32.2 +/- 4.0 mm Hg (P less than 0.0002), and the aortic valve area was increased from 0.49 +/- 0.04 cm2 to 0.85 +/- 0.10 cm2 (P less than 0.0002). Complications associated with PABV included left ventricular perforation in three patients (which resulted in death in one of them), transient congestive heart failure in one, and development of femoral pseudoaneurysms in one. After PABV, nine patients underwent the planned surgical procedure under general anesthesia without complications. Five patients underwent surgical diagnostic procedures after PABV that resulted in a change in treatment strategy. Three of these patients required no further treatment, and two required resection of the colon for bleeding, which was preceded by aortic valve replacement. This study demonstrates that PABV may be useful in reducing the risks of noncardiac procedures in selected patients with severe aortic stenosis who are otherwise not candidates for aortic valve replacement.\r"

Operative vaginoplasty was considered functionally successful by 40 of the 47 patients (85%) who responded to the survey, yet only 36 of these 40 (90%) had remained coitally active by the time of the survey.

Careful preoperative selection of patients is extremely important in achieving a successful outcome. At the Mayo Clinic, most facial cosmetic surgical procedures performed by the Department of Otorhinolaryngology are done on an outpatient basis. A combination of local anesthesia and intravenous sedation provides excellent patient tolerance and comfort both intraoperatively and postoperatively. Treatment involving the superficial musculoaponeurotic system is used for those patients who require additional underlying support and definition of the facial contour. Postoperative recovery is routinely uneventful. Complications of face-lift surgery are rarely encountered. Case reports are presented to illustrate the representative postoperative results.\r"

In addition, many patients who are candidates for coronary artery bypass procedures could likely benefit from these less invasive procedures. Although atherectomy has a theoretic potential for reducing the rate of restenosis by removing the plaque rather than pushing it to the side, it is unlikely to eliminate the restenosis problem completely. A more important advantage of atherectomy may be the potential for successful treatment of lesions that are anatomically unsuitable for PTCA. Even though balloon catheter technology has evolved to the point that almost all lesions in the coronary anatomy can be successfully negotiated, approximately half the coronary patients who require invasive therapy in the United States are still undergoing open-heart bypass procedures. Thus, if atherectomy can expand the indications for interventional therapy to the types of lesions that are currently considered unsuitable for PTCA, the large number of patients who are currently unable to benefit from interventional catheterization techniques could be treated. With all the new devices under investigation, carefully controlled prospective randomized trials must be conducted once the developmental phases have been completed. Each new technology must be compared with the current state-of-the-art techniques of balloon angioplasty and coronary artery bypass operation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Even when their food intake was in accordance with recommended levels, obese children had higher than normal weight as adults. Excessive overweight in puberty (SDS greater than +3) was associated with higher than expected morbidity and mortality in adult life. Weight-reducing measures should be started early in life to improve the unfavourable long-term prognosis for very obese children.\r"

Analyses were then done either by sequencing the appropriate region in at-risk female relatives or by detection of an altered restriction site.

In this study, purified IgG fractions of serum from patients with myxoedematous endemic cretinism inhibited thyrotropin-induced DNA synthesis in guineapig thyroid segments in a sensitive cytochemical bioassay. IgG from patients with euthyroid neurological endemic cretinism or from normal subjects did not inhibit thyroid growth. Furthermore, in myxoedematous subjects, the presence of the thyroid-growth-blocking immunoglobulins showed a positive relation with thyroid atrophy found on ultrasound. These findings provide a pathogenic basis for the variable clinical expression of endemic cretinism.\r"

A DNA sequence containing the whole of exon 3 and some 3' untranslated sequences within the beta-major haemoglobin gene was amplified in single blastomeres by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Blastomeres were removed from embryos of four to eight cells from normal BALB/c mice and from mutant (thalassaemic) BALB/c mice homozygous for a deletion of the whole beta-major haemoglobin gene. The sensitivity of the amplification procedure was enhanced by the sequential use of two sets of oligonucleotide primers for 30 cycles of amplification each, the second pair being located within the segment amplified by the first pair. The product (204 base-pairs) could be easily visualised in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Stringent precautions to prevent contamination were taken, and with these precautions the PCR amplification procedure could be carried out under normal laboratory conditions. These procedures for diagnosis of genetic disease before implantation should be applicable to preimplantation diagnosis of any monogenic disorder in man for which the affected DNA sequence is known.\r"

Success rates improved during the study; since 1985, the angiographic success rate for non-occluded arteries has been 91.0%. Early complications occurred in 6.8%; angioplasty achieved clinical success in 80.3% of all patients at discharge from hospital. The median duration of follow-up was 772 days, with clinical status established for 98.8% of patients. 5 years after clinically successful angioplasty, cumulative cardiac survival was 96.6% and freedom from cardiac death and myocardial infarction was 90.4% (95.8% and 85.4%, respectively, on intention-to-treat analysis). Within 5 years of successful angioplasty, 12.4% of survivors underwent coronary bypass surgery and 16.9% had repeat angioplasty. Freedom from all cardiac events at 5 years was 70.2% after clinically successful angioplasty and 60.2% on intention-to-treat analysis. Angina symptoms were improved in over 80% of patients and abolished in 75%.\r"

Along with the parotids, the submandibular and especially the sublingual glands may be quite enlarged, and the enlargement can be a useful clue to the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The gland enlargement regresses at least partly after thyroid replacement therapy.\r"

They were born in six districts of Hertfordshire, England, and their weights in infancy were recorded. 92.4% were breast fed. Men with the lowest weights at birth and at one year had the highest death rates from ischaemic heart disease. The standardised mortality ratios fell from 111 in men who weighed 18 pounds (8.2 kg) or less at one year to 42 in those who weighed 27 pounds (12.3 kg) or more. Measures that promote prenatal and postnatal growth may reduce deaths from ischaemic heart disease. Promotion of postnatal growth may be especially important in boys who weigh below 7.5 pounds (3.4 kg) at birth.\r"

  ".W": "Some patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are HB e antigen (HBeAg) negative, have circulating HBV particles, and often have especially severe chronic hepatitis. To test the hypothesis that the absence of HBeAg production may be due to a change in the nucleotide sequence of the pre-core region of the genome, 18 Greek and 3 non-Greek patients positive for HB surface antigen underwent direct sequencing of HBV-DNA amplified from sera. In 7 out of 8 HBeAg negative patients, two mutations (guanosine to adenosine) were found in the terminal two codons of the pre-core region, giving the sequence TAGGACATG. The remaining patient had the first mutation only. The sequence TGGGGCATG was found in 4 of 5 of the HBeAg positive patients. The first mutation results in a translational stop codon that is predicted to result in failure to produce HBeAg. The rest of the pre-core region in the HBeAg negative patients was otherwise homologous to that of the HBeAg positive patients and to known sequences.\r"

As judged by subsequent weight recovery in hospital, the main indicators of mild to moderate dehydration were decreased peripheral perfusion, deep breathing, decreased skin turgor, high urea, low pH, and a large base deficit; a history of increased thirst was just short of statistical significance. Dehydration was not indicated by a history of oliguria, by the presence of restlessness or lethargy, sunken eyes, dry mouth, or a sunken fontanelle or by the absence of tears. Clinical signs of dehydration became apparent at 3-4% rather than 5% dehydration. The degree of dehydration was overestimated by a mean of 3.2%; this caused unnecessary hospital admissions and overtreatment with intravenous fluid.\r"

Hypophosphataemia was a feature of paracetamol poisoning, whether hepatotoxicity was present or not. It correlated with the degree of hepatic damage and was not influenced by glucose infusions. Serum phosphate correlated with renal threshold phosphate concentration, so renal loss rather than intracellular redistribution of phosphate seems to be the reason for the hypophosphataemia in paracetamol overdose, and it correlates well with other indices of severity of poisoning.\r"

  ".W": "The management of glomus tympanicum tumors is not a new subject. A review of the contemporary management concept is, however, needed for two reasons: 1. the recent literature has suggested radiation therapy as a treatment option in this surgical disease, and 2. patients who are referred to us for management of these tumors continue to exhibit errors in diagnosis and surgical approaches that are unnecessarily radical. The purpose of this paper is to review the diagnosis of these lesions and to prospectively differentiate them from the more extensive jugulare tumors. When type and extent of the tumor are properly determined, a surgical procedure can be planned that conserves as much normal ear anatomy and function as possible. Between May 1970 and July 1988, 60 patients with glomus tympanicum tumors were treated at the Otology Group, P.C., in Nashville, Tennessee. In 47 patients (78%), the tumors were removed using an extended facial recess approach. The external auditory canal wall was removed in seven patients (12%), and six patients underwent a transcanal approach. Total tumor removal was obtained in 90% of patients. Surgical management remains the mainstay of treatment for glomus tympanicum tumors.\r"

Following surgery, direct endoscopic visualization of the area enables accurate follow-up. Unlike sinus obliteration, the ability to accurately image the sinus by CT is also preserved. This paper presents our preliminary experience with 18 mucoceles in which endoscopic sinus surgery was attempted. Five patients had preoperative proptosis and diplopia, three had Pott's puffy tumor and five had erosion of the posterior table of the frontal sinus. Fifteen patients were satisfactorily treated endoscopically, two lesions could not be satisfactorily approached and required external surgery, and one patient had persistent disease. No disease recurrence has been noted to date with endoscopic follow-up of up to 42 months.\r"

Accurate preoperative differentiation of the various lesions of the petrous apex by computed tomography scanning only has been difficult. We reviewed the clinical findings, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans, surgical approaches, and long-term follow-up in 10 patients with cholesterol granuloma of the petrous apex who were seen between 1971 and 1988. Headache and deficits of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th cranial nerves were common presenting symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging with special imaging techniques was accurate in diagnosing cholesterol granuloma in four patients preoperatively and three patients prior to revision surgery. The optimal surgical approach was chosen on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings and included the transsphenoidal, infralabyrinthine, transcochlear, and suboccipital routes. Our review reveals that magnetic resonance imaging is more specific than computed tomography in establishing a preoperative diagnosis and is also the technique of choice in follow-up. The long-term results are discussed.\r"

There were 7 ears with meatal atresia, 11 with partial atresia, 50 with total atresia, and 1 with hypopneumatic total atresia. Meatoplasty was performed in 7 ears, canaloplasty was performed in 22 ears, canaloplasties with strust in 8 ears, and mastoidectomy with stapediopexy was performed in 26 ears. Of the 62 ears that had partial or total atresia, five (8%) had hidden cholesteatomas that were destined to create future complications by expansion and erosion had they not been removed. In five of the 62 ears, temporary facial palsy resulted from exposing the facial nerve in the atresia plate, and in another five ears, attempts to improve hearing were abandoned intraoperatively because of surgically insurmountable anomalies. A reasonable criterion for success in an operation for bilateral atresia is that the need for a hearing aid is obviated; whereas, for unilateral atresia, a successful procedure should largely eliminate the disadvantages of unilateral hearing loss. These criteria seem to be satisfied if the threshold of hearing can be brought to a level of 20 dB or better. This criterion was met in 30% of the group that underwent canaloplasty and in 8% of the group that underwent mastoidectomy with stapediopexy.\r"

This will increase our understanding of the biochemical and cytochemical processes associated with hearing, and ultimately could have therapeutic implications. To achieve this goal, DNA linkage studies must be done to localize defective genes to specific chromosome regions. Previous data had suggested that the gene causing Usher's syndrome was located on chromosome 4 in close proximity to the Vitamin D binding protein. A DNA linkage analysis of this chromosome does not confirm the linkage relationship and excludes much of chromosome 4 as the site of the Usher's syndrome gene.\r"

  ".W": "Reconstruction of the ossicular mechanism using a tragal cartilage autograft frequently presents problems, including displacement of the cartilage graft, maintenance of firm and accurate contact between the graft and ossicular remnants, and loss of stiffness of the graft. To avoid these problems, we have used the cartilage graft and overlying perichondrium of appropriate size, with a tunnel made between the outer perichondrium and the cartilage to accommodate remnants of the incus or handle of the malleus. The graft has a small perichondrial flap on the other end for firm anchorage to the arch of the stapes or the footplate. This allows the cartilage graft to be firmly anchored with the adjacent ossicular remnants. The presence of perichondrium with the graft helps to maintain nutrition, stiffness, and the configuration of the cartilage. With minor modifications, we have used this technique in 115 patients to reconstruct different types of ossicular defects, with commendable hearing results. Of the 115 operated ears, an air-bone gap closure within 10 dB was found in 14.8%, within 15 dB in 34.8%, and within 20 dB in 24.4% of ears. In another 20.8% of cases, the air-bone gap closure remained in the range of 25 dB or less. The longest follow-up was 13 years 7 months. The presented technique is easy and effective and solves most of the problems of cartilage ossiculoplasty.\r"

Although the surgical techniques of transmeatal and the recently introduced retrosigmoid IAC approach have been well described, little has been written about the singular nerve's anatomical relationships determined histologically for each surgical approach. The anatomical relationships of the singular nerve in both the transmeatal and retrosigmoid IAC approaches are discussed. Histologic evidence presented suggests that other mechanisms may also be ultimately responsible for improvement in the symptoms of BPV following transmeatal surgery. Moreover, the high incidence of injury to the endolymphatic duct during retrosigmoid surgery raises questions about the exact role of the endolymphatic duct and sac in inner ear homeostasis.\r"

The PGG, EGG, and Psub signals were examined at three fundamental frequencies (F0) (100 Hz, 130 Hz, and 160 Hz) for RLNS, using a constant rate of air flow. Increasing RLNS, which caused activation of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles, produced a modest increase in F0, a marked increase in Psub, no change in the open quotient (OQ), and an increase in the closing quotient (CQ). Phase quotient (Qp), which describes the interval between opening of the lower and upper fold margins, decreased with increasing RLNS.\r"

In CIDP endoneurial pericapillary cellular infiltrates were found in 4 patients (29%), onion bulbs in 5 patients (36%), and predominant demyelination in 7 patients (50%). None of these abnormalities was specific, but cellular infiltrates and onion bulbs appear to be diagnostically useful when combined with clinical information. To detect macrophage infiltration of myelin, cell nuclei were counter-stained in 20 teased fiber preparations. Nine patients with CIDP had a significantly higher mean number of cells per centimeter of teased fiber than 11 patients with other neuropathies. Despite overlap, significant infiltration of myelin detected by this method suggests CIDP in an appropriate clinical setting.\r"

Electron microscopy showed areas filled with tubular aggregates and vesicular profiles. Scattered within some of the tubular aggregates circular profiles reminiscent of cylindrical spirals were seen. The presence of structures resembling cylindrical spirals within tubular aggregates suggest that they may arise from a component of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. There appears to be an intimate relationship between myalgia and these various types of abnormal membranous profiles; however, the pathophysiology remains to be elucidated.\r"

In muscle membrane fractions of Duchenne dystrophy patients there was a marked reduction in the concentrations of calsequestrin and a 39 kDa protein that stained blue with \"Stains-all.\" There were changes in the proteins of all subcellular fractions of Duchenne's patients; some of these changes appear to be specific for Duchenne dystrophy (DD). There was no apparent correlation between the protein changes observed on acrylamide gels and the age of the patients, the duration of the disease, the degree of disability, or activity of creatine kinase. A decreased level of calsequestrin in DD sarcoplasmic reticulum may contribute to an increased level of free calcium seen in muscle from these patients.\r"

The membrane of these myoballs was voltage-clamped in the whole-cell mode for the recording of sodium currents (at 11, 24, and 37 degrees C). The voltage dependence of the steady-state activation and inactivation curves showed only minor abnormalities in all cases. The time constants of activation (tau m) and inactivation (tau h), when studied at the three temperatures, showed a characteristic pattern of abnormalities. In myotonic dystrophy, both tau m and tau h were larger than control; in recessive generalized myotonia and adynamia episodica both tau m and tau h were smaller than control. In the latter diseases, these time constants also showed a smaller than normal decrease with membrane depolarization. The changes seen for recessive generalized myotonia and adynamia episodica would favour the occurrence of myotonia, the opposite results for myotonic dystrophy would oppose myotonia.\r"

No differences between DMD and control subjects in the pattern of erythrocyte membrane polypeptides separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis could be detected.

Motor conduction velocity (MCV) studies of median and/or peroneal nerves were performed on 99 of them. Seventy-three subjects were found to be affected. In all age categories including the first decade of life, the ratio of affected individuals at risk did not significantly differ from the expected 1:1 ratio; that is, penetrance of the gene was complete. The majority of affected members in the first decade had no clinical features considered diagnostic of peroneal muscular atrophy syndrome, and full clinical expression developed in the second decade. Marked slowing of MCV was already present in the early years of life, even as young as 6 months. Moreover serial MCV studies carried out throughout the first year of life in an affected girl showed no physiological increase in conduction velocity. For purposes of genetic counseling, our experience suggests that, starting from 6 months of age, a clinically and electrophysiologically normal subject has a zero risk of having inherited the HMSN type I gene. However given the limited numbers in this series, infants at risk with normal clinical evaluation and MCVs should be followed up yearly up to 5 years of age.\r"

The results show that isolated TC from human skeletal muscle share extensive morphological characteristics, protein composition, as well as Ca-release properties with rabbit TC, as tested with an inhibitor (Ruthenium red) and an activator (doxorubicin) of SR Ca-release. The Ca-pump membrane of human muscle SR, in distinction to rabbit fast muscle SR, showed a relatively low specific activity of the Ca-ATPase, as expected from the mixed fiber composition of human muscles, but shared the presence of minor protein components, such as a Con A binding protein of about 57 kDa and blue-staining peptides in the 170-120 kDa range of molecular weights. Human muscle TT, as isolated from the same sucrose gradient, demonstrated a high affinity (3H)-dihydropiridine binding activity in the range of previously reported values for purified TT from rabbit skeletal muscle.\r"

TBARS concentrations and enzyme activities were increased after exercise, with peak values observed at 6 hours (TBARS, LDH) or 24 hours (CK, AST) after exercise. Serum LDH activity returned to preexercise levels by 48 hours after exercise and TBARS by 72 hours after exercise: CK and AST activities remained elevated 72 hours after exercise. Leg muscle soreness also increased, with the greatest degree of soreness seen at 24 or 48 hours after exercise. Subjects with the greatest increase in CK, LDH, and AST also showed the highest serum TBARS concentration. This suggests a possible relationship between free radical generation and exercise-induced muscle damage.\r"

  ".W": "Of 155 children with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) whom we evaluated during a 6 1/2-year period, 12 were found to have proteinuria. Histologic studies of tissue from these 12 patients revealed a wide spectrum of renal disease: focal glomerulosclerosis in 5, mesangial hyperplasia in 5, segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis in 1, and minimal change disease in 1. In addition, 6 had tubulointerstitial infiltrates, and 10 had glomerular dense deposits. All 10 renal specimens studied by electron microscopy contained endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions. The mean age (+/- SD) of the five patients with focal glomerulosclerosis when this condition was identified was 27 +/- 19 months. All five had severe renal failure within a year and died of other causes during the following year. The mean age of the five patients with mesangial hyperplasia was 38 +/- 31 months. Although none of them went on to have renal failure, four died within 8 +/- 7 months. Ten of the 12 patients with proteinuria died during the study period. Of the two surviving, one had mesangial hyperplasia and the other had minimal change disease. We conclude that children who acquire human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during the perinatal period may have renal disease, most often focal glomerulosclerosis, as is the case in adults, or mesangial hyperplasia. Although 5 of the 12 children we studied had renal failure during the study period, none died of it. Further studies are needed to determine the correlations between clinical and pathological features and the pathophysiology of AIDS nephropathy in children.\r"

Patients with pemphigus foliaceus have antibodies to a complex of three polypeptides of 260, 160, and 85 kd (the foliaceus complex), whereas patients with pemphigus vulgaris have antibodies to a complex of 210-kd, 130-kd, and 85-kd polypeptides (the vulgaris complex). The 160-kd polypeptide of the foliaceus complex has been identified as desmoglein, a desmosomal glycoprotein. We suspected that the 85-kd component in both these antigenic complexes might be plakoglobin, another molecule in the adhering junctions of cells. To characterize these antigenic complexes, we used the serum of five patients with pemphigus foliaceus, that of four patients with pemphigus vulgaris, and monoclonal antiplakoglobin antibodies. We found that monoclonal antibodies to plakoglobin immunoprecipitated the 85-kd polypeptide from the dissociated foliaceus and vulgaris complexes and precipitated both complexes from epidermal extracts. Serum from patients with pemphigus foliaceus or pemphigus vulgaris (but not from four normal controls) bound desmoglein and the 130-kd polypeptide, respectively, showing that these peptides (and not plakoglobin) are the antigenic binding sites in these disorders. We conclude that plakoglobin, a protein of the adhering junctions of epidermal cells, is the 85-kd molecule in the antigenic complexes found in both pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris, although it is not the binding site in either disorder.\r"

  ".U": "89365013\r", 
  ".W": "The early discrimination of clinically aggressive breast cancer from indolent disease would be clinically useful. Some human breast cancers express haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr), the HPR gene product, or a substance that shares epitopes with it. We retrospectively examined the association between the expression of Hpr and the recurrence of cancer in 70 patients with early breast cancer (Stage I or II) treated by mastectomy from 1977 through 1985, using immunohistochemical analysis of routinely processed paraffin-embedded tissue and evaluating it without knowledge of the patients' status. The expression of Hpr epitopes was associated with earlier recurrence according to life-table analysis (P less than 0.0002). Progesterone-receptor status (determined in 64 patients), tumor size, clinical stage, axillary-lymphnode status, mitotic index, and tumor necrosis also predicted recurrence, but multivariate analysis showed that Hpr-epitope expression was an independent prognostic factor. Since both Hpr status and progesterone-receptor status were independent predictors of recurrence, they could be combined to stratify the cases further: breast cancer was found to have recurred in 11 of 12 patients (92 percent) who were positive for Hpr and negative for progesterone receptors, in 5 of 11 (45 percent) who were positive for Hpr and positive for progesterone receptors, and in 9 of 41 (22 percent) who were negative for Hpr, in whom progesterone-receptor status had little effect. We conclude that Hpr-epitope expression is a clinically important predictor of the recurrence of cancer in patients with early breast cancer, especially in combination with progesterone-receptor status.\r"

To determine the relative prevalence of certain of the genetic variants of this disorder, we used immunoblotting to detect two specific neutrophil cytosolic proteins of 47 and 67 kd recently shown to be required for oxidase activation. Chronic granulomatous disease is usually an X-linked disorder associated with the absence of membrane cytochrome b558. Of our 94 patients with chronic granulomatous disease, however, 36 had a phenotype characterized by autosomal inheritance, normal membrane oxidase components (including cytochrome b558), and functionally defective cytosolic activity in a cell-free oxidase system. We studied 25 of these 36 patients and found that 22 lacked the 47-kd cytosolic protein, and the remaining 3 were missing the 67-kd component. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease whose functional defect was localized to the neutrophil membrane (classic X-linked cytochrome b-negative type and two other rare variants) had normal amounts of both cytosolic components. We estimate that approximately 33 percent of all patients with chronic granulomatous disease are missing the 47-kd cytosolic oxidase component and about 5 percent of patients are missing the 67-kd component. Chronic granulomatous disease caused by a defect in any cytosolic factors other than the 47-kd and 67-kd proteins, if it exists, is apparently rare.\r"

All 12 patients were male and 22 years of age or younger when chronic granulomatous disease was diagnosed. Six patients had hydroureteronephrosis in association with recurrent episodes of pyelonephritis, retroperitoneal lymphadenitis, and granuloma formation. The other six patients had genital lesions or dysuria. Among the six patients with hydroureteronephrosis, a nephrectomy was performed in two, ureterolysis was used to relieve obstruction in one, and hydroureteronephrosis resolved after antibiotic therapy alone in three. We conclude that complications involving the genitourinary system occur frequently in patients with chronic granulomatous disease.

  ".W": "The wearing of contact lenses has increased dramatically in the past decade; over 4 million people in the United States now use extended-wear soft contact lenses, and 9 million use daily-wear soft contact lenses. Numerous reports have caused concern that the use of soft contact lenses, especially extended-wear lenses, may result in a substantial risk of ulcerative keratitis. To examine this issue, we conducted a prospective study in five New England states to estimate the incidence of ulcerative keratitis among those who use cosmetic extended-wear and daily-wear soft contact lenses. To obtain the numerator for each estimate of incidence, we surveyed all practicing ophthalmologists in the study area to identify all new cases diagnosed over a four-month period. To provide the denominator, we conducted a survey of 4178 households to estimate the number of persons who wore each type of soft contact lens. The annualized incidence of ulcerative keratitis was estimated to be 20.9 per 10,000 persons using extended-wear soft contact lenses for cosmetic purposes and 4.1 per 10,000 persons using daily-wear soft contact lenses for cosmetic purposes (P less than 0.00001).\r"

  ".W": "Inhibin is a peptide hormone normally produced by ovarian granulosa cells. It reaches a peak of 772 +/- 38 U per liter in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and is undetectable in the serum of menopausal women. To determine whether measurements of serum inhibin levels would provide a biochemical marker of the presence or progression of ovarian granulosa-cell tumors and their metastases, we measured the serum immunoreactive inhibin concentrations in six women with such tumors. Three women had been treated by hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In the two women with residual or recurrent disease, the serum inhibin levels were abnormally elevated 5 and 20 months before the clinical manifestations of recurrence became evident. The maximal concentrations approached 3000 U per liter. The serum inhibin level remained undetectable in one patient who was disease-free for 11 years. Serum inhibin concentrations were also elevated in three women with amenorrhea and infertility that resulted from small granulosa-cell tumors. After the removal of the tumors, the serum inhibin levels in these women became normal, and fertility returned. There was a significant negative correlation between the serum concentrations of inhibin and follicle-stimulating hormone, in a manner consistent with the autonomous production of inhibin by granulosa-cell tumors. We conclude that granulosa-cell tumors produce inhibin. Since serum inhibin levels reflect the size of the tumor, measurements of inhibin can be used as a marker for primary as well as recurrent disease.\r"

We describe 21 patients (mean age, 66 years) with such infection without the usual predisposing factors, representing 18 percent of the 119 patients surveyed. Seventeen women and 4 men were given a diagnosis of M. avium complex from 1978 to 1987, with a stable incidence over the decade, on the basis of pulmonary symptoms, abnormalities on chest films, positive cultures, and in 14, biopsy evidence of invasive disease. Most of the patients (86 percent) presented with persistent cough and purulent sputum, usually without fever or weight loss. The cough was present for a mean of 25 weeks before the correct diagnosis was made. Radiographic patterns of slowly progressive nodular opacities predominated (71 percent); only five patients had cavitary disease at presentation. All patients responded initially to antimycobacterial therapy, but eight eventually relapsed when it was stopped. Four patients died of progressive pulmonary infection caused by M. avium complex. The extent of the initial pulmonary involvement was greater in patients with progressive disease than in those whose condition improved. We conclude that pulmonary disease caused by the M. avium complex can affect persons without predisposing conditions, particularly elderly women, and that recognition of this disease is often delayed because of its indolent nature.\r"

  ".W": "To identify risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in intravenous drug users, we undertook a study of the seroprevalence of HIV antibody in 452 persons enrolled in a methadone-treatment program in the Bronx, New York. The seroprevalence of HIV was 39.4 percent overall, 49.1 percent in blacks, 41.8 percent in Hispanics, and 17.2 percent in non-Hispanic whites (P less than 0.001 for all comparisons). The presence of HIV antibody was associated with the number of injections per month (P less than 0.001), the percentage of injections with used needles (P less than 0.001), the average number of injections with cocaine per month (P less than 0.001), and the percentage of injections with needles that were shared with strangers or acquaintances (P less than 0.001), a practice that was more common among blacks and Hispanics than among whites. The number of heterosexual sex partners who used intravenous drugs was associated with HIV infection in women (P less than 0.004) and was the only risk factor found for users who had not injected drugs after 1982 (P less than 0.05). The presence of HIV antibody was independently associated with being black or Hispanic (adjusted odds ratio, 4.56; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.65 to 8.14), a more recent year of the last injection of drugs (adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.35), the percentage of injections of drugs that took place in \"shooting galleries\" (adjusted odds ratio, 1.49; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 1.88), having sex partners who used intravenous drugs (adjusted odds ratio 1.24; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.45), and low income (adjusted odds ratio, 1.55; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.10 to 2.17). We conclude that differences in both the social setting of drug use and behavior related to injection carry different risks for infection with HIV and may explain, in part, the higher seroprevalence of HIV among blacks and Hispanics. In addition, we found that heterosexual activity was an independent risk factor for drug users.\r"

  ".U": "89365139\r", 
  ".W": "The phenomenon of long-term potentiation (LTP), a long lasting increase in the strength of synaptic transmission which is due to brief, repetitive activation of excitatory afferent fibres, is one of the most striking examples of synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the induction of LTP requires activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors by synaptically released glutamate with concomitant postsynaptic membrane depolarization. This relieves the voltage-dependent magnesium block of the NMDA-receptor ion channel, allowing calcium to flow into the dendritic spine. Although calcium has been shown to be a necessary trigger for LTP (refs 11, 12), little is known about the immediate biochemical processes that are activated by calcium and are responsible for LTP. The most attractive candidates have been calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII) (refs 13-16), protein kinase C (refs 17-19), and the calcium-dependent protease, calpain. Extracellular application of protein kinase inhibitors to the hippocampal slice preparation blocks the induction of LTP (refs 21-23) but it is unclear whether this is due to a pre- and/or postsynaptic action. We have found that intracellular injection into CA1 pyramidal cells of the protein kinase inhibitor H-7, or of the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium, blocks LTP. Furthermore, LTP is blocked by the injection of synthetic peptides that are potent calmodulin antagonists and inhibit CaM-KII auto- and substrate phosphorylation. These findings demonstrate that in the postsynaptic cell both activation of calmodulin and kinase activity are required for the generation of LTP, and focus further attention on the potential role of CaM-KII in LTP.\r"

Introns could provide non-coding targets for recombination, which would then give rise to novel combinations of exons. Evidence to support this theory is indirect and consists of examples of homologous domains of protein structure encoded in different genes, with introns in conserved positions at the boundaries of these domains. Here, we report the first direct evidence for exon shuffling. Two spontaneous deletion mutations of phage T4 have been characterized by sequencing, and they are clearly the result of recombination between homologous regions of two self-splicing group I introns. As a result of the recombination, exons of different genes are transcribed together, with a hybrid intron between them. One of these introns is proficient in self-splicing.\r"

The 'primitive' neuromuscular junction of the jellyfish Polyorchis penicillatus is a useful model of presynaptic modulation. In this study, we show that the durations of action potentials in the motor neurons of this jellyfish are negatively correlated with the amplitude of excitatory junctional potentials. We present data from in vitro voltage-clamp experiments showing that short duration voltage spikes, which elicit large excitatory junctional potentials in vivo, produce larger and briefer calcium currents than do long duration action potentials, which elicit small excitatory junctional potentials.\r"

Using in vitro transcripts made from a directional complementary DNA library we have isolated, by expression cloning in Xenopus oocytes, a novel K+-channel gene (drk1). Functionally, drk1 encodes channels that are K+ selective and belong to the delayed rectifier class of channels, rather than the A-type class encoded by the Shaker gene of Drosophila. The channels show sigmoidal voltage-dependent activation and do not inactivate within 500 ms. Structurally, drk1 encodes an amino-acid sequence which is more closely related to the Drosophila Shab gene than to the Shaker gene.\r"

In the brain it exists as a pair of high-molecular weight proteins, MAP2a and MAP2b, and a smaller form, MAP2c, which is particularly abundant in the developing brain. High-molecular weight MAP2 is expressed in dendrites, where its messenger RNA is also located, but is not found in axons; it has been shown to be present in fine filaments that crosslink dendritic microtubules. This correlates with the primary structure of high-molecular weight MAP2, which consists of a short carboxy-terminal tubulin-binding domain and a long amino-terminal arm, which forms a filamentous sidearm on reconstituted microtubules. Here we report that the high- and low-molecular weight forms of MAP2 are generated by alternative splicing and share the entire C-terminal tubulin-binding domain as well as a short N-terminal sequence. In contrast to high molecular weight MAP2, embryonic brain MAP2c lacks 1,342 amino acids from the filamentous sidearm domain. Furthermore, the mRNA for low molecular weight MAP2c is not present in dendrites, indicating that the dendritic targeting signal is specific for the high-molecular weight form.\r"

Previously we have noted a close homology between the DNA-binding domains of the epsilon-retinoic acid receptor (RAR-epsilon, also designated RAR-beta), the thyroid hormone receptors and the oestrogen receptor. We have now found that RAR-epsilon is very efficient at inducing transcription from two distinct thyroid-hormone responsive elements (TREs). Transcription induced by ligand-activated RAR-epsilon from a TRE can, however, be repressed by thyroid-hormone receptor in the absence of its ligand. Conversely, in the presence of its ligand, thyroid-hormone receptor will activate transcription from a TRE irrespective of the presence of unbound RAR. The use of hybrid receptors has shown that the DNA-binding domain of RAR is the essential target for inhibition by thyroid-hormone receptors. These data, together with in vitro DNA-binding studies, suggest that thyroid-hormone receptors may have dual regulatory roles: in the presence of hormone they function as TRE-specific transcriptional activators; in the absence of hormone, however, they can function as TRE-specific repressors.\r"

  ".W": "Neurons in many regions of the mammalian nervous system generate action potentials in two distinct modes: rhythmic oscillations in which spikes cluster together in a cyclical manner, and single spike firing in which action potentials occur relatively independently of one another. Which mode of action potential generation a neuron displays often varies with the behavioural state of the animal. For example, the shift from slow-wave sleep to waking and attentiveness is associated with a change in thalamic neurons from rhythmic burst firing to repetitive single spike activity, and a greatly increased responsiveness to excitatory synaptic inputs. This marked change in firing pattern and excitability is controlled in part by ascending noradrenergic and serotonergic inputs from the brainstem, although the cellular mechanisms of this effect have remained largely unknown. Here we report that noradrenaline and serotonin enhance a mixed Na+/K+ current which is activated by hyperpolarization (Ih) and that this enhancement may be mediated by increases in intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP. This novel action of noradrenaline and serotonin reduces the ability of thalamic neurons to generate rhythmic burst firing and promotes a state of excitability that is conducive to the thalamocortical synaptic processing associated with cognition.\r"

We report here that isoprenaline induced large chloride-ion currents in voltage-clamped, internally-dialysed myocytes from guinea-pig ventricles. The Cl- current could be activated by intracellular dialysis with cAMP or the catalytic subunit of PKA, indicating regulation by phosphorylation. In approximately symmetrical solutions of high Cl- concentration, the macroscopic cardiac Cl- current showed little rectification, unlike the single-channel current in PKA-regulated Cl- channels of airway epithelial cells. But, like epithelial Cl- -channel currents, the cardiac Cl- current was sensitive to the distilbene,4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DNDS). In the absence of kinase activation, cardiac sarcolemmal Cl- conductance was negligible. During beta-adrenergic stimulation of the heart, this novel Cl- conductance should accelerate action-potential repolarization and so protect impulse propagation in the face of the possibly arrhythmogenic increases in heart rate and in calcium entry into the cells.\r"

This 21-base pair (bp) sequence, called as-1, is involved in root expression of the 35S promoter. When inserted in a promoter of a gene expressed specifically in photosynthetic tissues, as-1 confers high level expression in roots. We have described a factor, ASF-1, that binds specifically to as-1 in vitro. There is a good correlation between ASF-1 binding affinity to as-1 related sequences in vitro and the function of these sequences in vivo. These results strongly suggest that ASF-1 is responsible for the function of as-1. Here we report the isolation of tobacco complementary DNA clones encoding two TGACG-sequence-specific binding-proteins (TGA1a and TGA1b). Sequence analysis of the cDNA clones shows that both proteins contain a basic region that shows high homology to a stretch of basic amino acids in the nuclear factors CREB, GCN4, and c-Jun to a 'leucine-zipper' region. On the basis of binding specificity we propose TGA1a to be a good candidate for ASF-1.\r"

We have now measured the performance of monkeys and of visual cortical neurons while the animals performed a psychophysical task well matched to the properties of the neurons under study. Here we report that the reliability and sensitivity of most neurons on this task equalled or exceeded that of the monkeys. We therefore suggest that under our conditions, psychophysical judgements could be based on the activity of a relatively small number of neurons.\r"

But quantitative neurobehavioural data and detailed neuropathological information are rarely available for the same patients. One case has demonstrated that selective bilateral damage to the hippocampus causes a circumscribed memory impairment in the absence of other intellectual deficits. This finding, in conjunction with evidence from humans and monkeys, indicates that the hippocampus together with adjacent and anatomically related structures is essential for the formation of long-term memory, perhaps by virtue of the extensive reciprocal connections between the hippocampal formation and putative memory storage sites in the neocortex. Although cognitive studies of amnesia provide useful information about the functional organization of normal memory, it has not usually been possible to relate memory impairment to anatomy in living patients. We have developed a high-resolution protocol for imaging the human hippocampus with magnetic resonance that permits visualization of the hippocampal formation in substantial cytoarchitectonic detail, revealing abnormalities in patients with severe and selective memory impairment.\r"

  ".W": "The entry of calcium ions into cells through voltage-activated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane triggers many important cellular processes. The activity of these channels is regulated by several hormones and neurotransmitters, as well as intracellular messengers such as Ca2+ itself (for examples, see refs 1-9). In cardiac muscle, myoplasmic Ca2+ has been proposed to potentiate Ca2+ influx, although a direct effect of Ca2+ on these channels has not yet been demonstrated. Photosensitive 'caged-Ca2+' molecules such as nitr-5, however, provide powerful tools for investigating possible regulatory roles of Ca2+ on the functioning of Ca2+ channels. Because its affinity for Ca2+ is reduced by irradiation, nitr-5 can be loaded into cells and induced to release Ca2+ with a flash of light. By using this technique we found that the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration directly augmented Ca2+-channel currents in isolated cardiac muscle cells from both frog and guinea pig. The time course of the current potentiation was similar to that seen with beta-adrenergic stimulation. Thus Ca2+ may work through a similar pathway, involving phosphorylation of a regulatory Ca2+-channel protein. This mechanism is probably important for the accumulation of Ca2+ and the amplification of the contractile response in cardiac muscle, and may have a role in other excitable cells.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective analysis of the cases of 173 patients operated on for aneurysms and admitted to a neurosurgical service early after subarachnoid hemorrhage was conducted with respect to white blood cell (WBC) count and highest daily temperature. Daily trends for the development of clinically significant vasospasm (VSP) as well as mortality during the hospitalization were analyzed. An admission WBC count greater than 15 x 10(9)/l was associated with 55% mortality as opposed to 25% mortality for those with a lower WBC count. The mortality of those with a temperature greater than 37.5 degrees C on Day 0 was 60%, compared with 35% for those with a lower temperature. A WBC count greater than 15 x 10(9)/l on Day 0 was associated with a VSP rate of 40%; a lower WBC count was associated with a VSP rate of 30% Day 0 temperatures greater than 37.5 degrees C were associated with a VSP rate of 40%, while patients with lower temperature had a VSP rate of 30%. By Day 6, the patients with temperatures greater than 37.5 degrees C had a VSP rate of 60%, double that of the VSP rate of those with temperatures less than 37.5 degrees C. WBC count was apparently more closely linked to the chance of dying than the chance of developing VSP. The development of fever after a few days is related to both increased mortality and increased chance of developing VSP.\r"

  ".W": "A consecutive series of 118 patients operated on for ruptured intracranial arterial aneurysms was studied. Ninety-six of them could be adequately examined with a battery of psychological tests and computed tomographic scans 1 year after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Seventeen orthopedic control patients with no history of brain damage were also tested. The pattern of cognitive deficits was strongly related to the findings on the computed tomographic scans. Patients with left lateral infarctions had deficits on performances requiring verbal efficiency, including memory and classification tasks, whereas patients who had right lateral infarctions were poor on a visuoconstructional task (the copying of Rey's Figure). These deficits were pronounced when lateral infarction was associated with diffuse brain damage. Patients with frontal medial infarctions had low scores on memory tests; the inefficiency in verbal fluency, categorical reasoning, and memory was related to diffuse brain damage. The patients who had no infarctions did not differ significantly from the control group. Cognitive impairments after left lateral and frontal medial infarctions, as well as diffuse brain damage, correlated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale.\r"

  ".W": "The contents of 14 cysts that were located within human intracranial tumors were obtained at surgery by needle aspiration. These tumor cyst fluids (TCFs) were mostly derived from glial tumors (10 cases). TCFs from one metastasis from a mammary carcinoma, one cystic meningioma, one hemangioblastoma, and a cystic acoustic neurinoma were also included. These TCFs were added to primary cultures of human gliomas, established human glioma cell lines, and normal human arachnoid cells in culture. The presence of proliferation-promoting factors in all cyst fluids could be demonstrated. On the basis of the response patterns of the cultures, it was possible to distinguish different levels of growth autonomy and growth factor sensitivity among these cultures and to speculate about varying degrees of cellular autocrine activation. The TCFs appear to contain factors that are not normally present in fetal calf serum, which is a regular constituent of most cell culture media. Some primary cultured cells as well as cell lines react in an oversensitive manner to the addition of TCFs.\r"

  ".U": "89365462\r", 
  ".W": "A major technical challenge to the use of interstitial hyperthermia in malignant brain tumors is the production of a well-defined, uniform hyperthermal field. In theory, A 915-MHz microwave antenna should allow fewer antennas to be used and cause less mechanical brain damage; however, standard radiation afterloading catheters require antennas to be 12 cm long; this is clearly impractical for intracranial use. Since alumina ceramic (Al2O3) catheters permit short microwave antennas (3-5 cm in length) to function properly in neural tissue, it is important to test the biocompatibility of alumina for use in combined interstitial microwave hyperthermia and brachytherapy. A 5-mm length of alumina catheter was implanted into the brains of 15 white rats. The animals were killed at 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. Histological examination revealed only minor mechanical damage and no encapsulation until 1 month; even then, the glial wall was only a few cell layers thick. Five animals received implants and were killed at similar intervals for x-ray microanalysis with the scanning electron microscope. No migration of aluminum into the brain was detected when compared with two control animals that did not receive implants and an alumina blank. Although we measured 50% attenuation of the radiation from iridium-192 sources in alumina catheters as compared with conventional ones, alumina catheters can still be used for interstitial radiation by increasing either the activity of the seeds or the duration of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Repair of cranial defects for brain protection and aesthetics is currently a surgical problem for which there is no completely satisfactory solution. Material used for repair of cranial defects should ideally be incorporated by the body and provided a blood supply. No substance to date, including autologous bone, consistently achieves this. Hydroxylapatite is a polycrystalline, nonresorptive, biocompatible ceramic that allows osseous tissue ingrowth and ultimate transformation into vascularized bone. The authors have used granular hydroxylapatite successfully for reconstructing calvarial defects, but have experienced problems with migration of granules, prolonged mobility, and, in one patient, resorption of an underlying supporting bone graft. The use of hydroxylapatite in block form precludes most of these problems. Porous block or strips are easily contoured and can be fixed at the margin of the calvarial defect, providing immediate stability. Ingrowth of osteoblastic and fibrous tissue provides added strength and stability. This paper describes our experience with porous hydroxylapatite blocks for reconstructive cranioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the incidence of acute complications of an operation in a large cross-section of U.S. community hospitals, we developed a method that combines the screening of discharge abstracts with the sampling of medical records. Our target patients were those who underwent discectomy for routine lumbar discogenic radiculopathy. We assembled 39,389 discharge abstracts of patients who underwent lumbar discectomy in the U.S. in 1980. This population contained some nontarget patients with a) errors in principal diagnosis or procedure, b) operations exceeding two levels, c) fusion, d) previous laminectomy, or e) problems of the lumbar spine in excess of routine disc disease. Screening of discharge abstracts allowed us to exclude some of these patients. Those remaining were then divided by the reported hospitalization into three groups: 1) death, 2) nonfatal complication, and 3) normal hospitalization. A sample of patients from each group was selected for detailed study, and questionnaires were mailed to hospital medical records departments to confirm the hospitalization and to obtain other medical information unavailable in the abstract. With this information, we 1) removed the remaining nontarget patients (a through e above); 2) categorized reported complications as erroneous, preexistent, trivial or major; 3) calculated the incidence of major complications; and 4) assessed the reliability of the discharge abstract data. Principal diagnosis and procedure were reliably coded in 96.5% of abstracts. No deaths were reported in error and none were excluded in error. Among patients who had complications, 4% of the abstracts incorrectly indicated complications, and 11% omitted one complication while correctly reporting others.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
