Sputum from asthmatic patients and subjects with corticosteroid-responsive cough contained eosinophils and metachromatic cells. Macrophages were by far the dominant cell type in sputum from subjects with chronic bronchitis. Airway inflammation with eosinophils and metachromatic cells is not always accompanied by increased airway responsiveness, and current definitions of obstructive airways disease may need to be revised.\r"

At least 75% of the difference was accounted for by CHD in men with minor alleles of 4 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in the region of the apolipoprotein (apo) AI and apo CIII genes. The RFLPs were identified with the restriction enzymes XmnI, PstI, MspI, and SacI. Each polymorphism has two alleles (major and minor), designated X1 and X2, P1 and P2, M1 and M2, and S1 and S2, respectively. In men with any one of the minor alleles, a family history of CHD was associated with a 234% increase in CHD prevalence. In men with major alleles only, a family history of CHD was not associated with any significant increase in CHD. The effect of the minor alleles was not significantly altered when plasma lipids and other variables except for age were taken into account. The association between the minor RFLP alleles and polymorphic gene variants (probably the apo AI, apo CIII, or both genes) which enhance liability to CHD accounted for almost 20% of total CHD in this population.\r"

Body weight was measured daily and fasting resting metabolic rate (RMR) on days 1, 7, and 21. Both weight and RMR fell more rapidly in the first week than later. The thermic effect of feeding fell immediately on the lower energy intake, and there was an adaptive reduction of about 6% in RMR in week 1. After 3 weeks, the average weight loss was 4.9 (1.2) kg (about 5% of initial weight) and the average fall in RMR 8.8%. If after substantial weight loss a woman eats just enough to maintain energy balance the adaptive reduction in metabolic rate is restored to normal, and the thermic effect of feeding is restored in proportion to the new energy intake, but total energy requirements remain less than in the obese state to the extent that fat-free mass has been reduced. Thus, an obese woman who reduces weight by 30% over a year will thereafter have requirements for weight maintenance which are reduced by about 15%.\r"

A significant relation was found between the frequency and severity of side-effects and the degree of parasite infestation, as quantified by the skin-snip counts. Free administration of ivermectin to severely infected onchocerciasis patients is not recommended without some form of medical supervision.\r"

  ".W": "Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy can only be used for laser angioplasty guidance if high-power laser ablation does not significantly alter the pattern of tissue fluorescence. Although the spectra of normal and atherosclerotic arteries differ, the change in fluorescence spectra following laser angioplasty has not been well studied. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy could guide selective laser ablation of atherosclerotic plaque and, if so, to develop a quantitative LIF score that could be used to control a \"smart\" laser angioplasty system. Baseline LIF spectroscopy of 50 normal and 50 atherosclerotic human aortic specimens was performed using an optical fiber coupled to a He-Cd laser and optical multichannel analyzer. LIF was then serially recorded during erbium:YAG laser ablation of 27 atherosclerotic specimens. Laser ablation was terminated when the arterial LIF spectrum visually appeared normal. Histologic analysis revealed a mean initial plaque thickness of 1,228 +/- 54 microns and mean residual plaque thickness of 198 +/- 27 microns. Ablation of the media occurred in only three specimens. A discriminant function was derived to discriminate atherosclerotic from normal tissue for computer guidance of laser angioplasty. The LIF score, derived from stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis of the LIF spectra, correctly classified 93% of aortic specimens. The spectra obtained from the atherosclerotic specimens subjected to fluorescence-guided laser revealed a change in score from \"atherosclerotic\" to \"normal\" following plaque ablation. Seven atherosclerotic specimens were subjected to laser angioplasty with on-line computer control using the LIF score. Mean initial plaque thickness was 1,014 +/- 86 microns, and mean residual plaque thickness was 78 +/- 29 microns. There was no evidence of ablation of the media. Therefore, LIF guidance of laser ablation resulted in minimal residual plaque without arterial perforation. These findings support the feasibility of an LIF-guided laser angioplasty system for selective atherosclerotic plaque ablation.\r"

  ".W": "The use of fluorescence emission for guidance during laser angioplasty may be limited by the complexity of the emission from the broad range of atherosclerotic plaques normally encountered in disease coronary arteries. Fatty, fibrous, and calcific plaque content as well as maximal intimal thickness were measured and correlated with fluorescence intensity ratios from the emission spectra for a broad cross-section of atherosclerotic plaques from human necropsy specimens. Multiple and stepwise regression analysis was used to analyze intensity ratios of 13 wavelengths between 390 and 600 nm corresponding to regions of observed spectral structure. The level of correlation of the intensity ratios with fatty and calcific plaque content was found to be dependent on the complexity of the atherosclerotic lesion. The fluorescence emission was found to correlate well with both fibrous plaque content and intimal thickness, allowing the differentiation between normal and atherosclerotic samples. In conclusion, plaque characteristics can be assessed by fluorescence emission, although the successful implementation of spectroscopic guidance is dependent on the level of prediction error which may vary with tissue type.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous laser thermal probe angioplasty requires sufficient laser probe flexibility to access the coronary tree. This may entail a loss of axial strength and the resultant slow advancement may lead to unwanted heating of the normal coronary artery proximal to the lesion. To assess the lateral thermal effects of stationary coronary laser probes, laser thermal energy (50-150 J) was delivered to 25 coronary artery segments (diameter 1.9-4.0 mm) in a perfused cadaver heart preparation using a 1.7 mm tip probe. Adherence to the vessel wall occurred in 19 segments, endothelial charring in 8 segments, and perforation in 3 segments. Endothelial charring was seen in 8 of 13 nonperfused segments but in 0 of 12 segments perfused at 60 ml/minute (P less than 0.01). In all three perforations the vessel to probe diameter ratio was less than 1.6:1, perfusion was absent, and traction to dislodge the adherent probe was necessary. Lateral wall damage is a complication of stationary laser probes: smaller-tipped probes which are advanced rapidly at the time of energy delivery may enhance the safety margins of coronary laser thermal probe angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Reduction of vascular recoil is an important goal of laser balloon angioplasty (LBA), wherein Nd:YAG laser radiation is delivered radially during balloon inflation. To define the acute and chronic effects of LBA on the normal arterial lumen in comparison with those of balloon angioplasty (BA), 36 New Zealand White male rabbits (3-4 kg) were subjected to LBA of an external iliac artery and to BA of the contralateral artery with two 1-minute balloon inflations. During LBA, which was performed during the second balloon inflation, either 300 (n = 26) or 176 (n = 10) J were delivered to achieve high and moderate laser doses, respectively, in different LBA groups. Angiography was performed pre- and post-LBA/BA and subsequently at intervals of either 1, 2, 7, 28, 48, or 223 days. Automated analysis of digitized images was used to measure lumen diameter. No instance of perforation or thrombosis occurred. LBA-treated arteries acutely showed an increase in mean diameter over baseline (+ .5 mm, P less than .01) and that of BA-treated arteries (+ .4 mm, P less than .01). While arteries treated with the high laser dose showed a loss of the initial gain in lumen diameter by 1 month, caused by both extravascular fibrosis of the thinwalled (less than 0.1 mm) artery and mild neointimal proliferation which were not reduced by daily administration of aspirin in seven rabbits, arteries treated with the moderate laser dose retained the increment in mean diameter at 1 month over that of BA-treated arteries (+ .5 mm, P less than .05). Thus, unlike BA, LBA increases luminal diameter acutely and, at a moderate laser dose, chronically.\r"

  ".W": "Laser welding offers several potential advantages over suture closure, including improved healing, lack of a nidus for stone formation, and greater speed and ease. We examined in vitro gallbladder cystic duct welds created by two different systems, the thulmium-holmium-chromium (THC):YAG (2,150 nm) and argon ion (488-514 nm) lasers, in an effort to define suitable parameters for tissue fusion. Mean bursting pressures for argon welds were 95 mm Hg at 1.5 W CW and 26 mm Hg at 1.5 W, 50 msec chopped delivery. For the THC:YAG laser, the mean bursting pressure for welds created with 300 mJ pulses was 45 mm Hg. Full-thickness tissue fusion and limited collateral thermal damage were observed histologically for both the CW argon and pulsed THC:YAG welds. Examination of the suggested mechanisms of tissue fusion for these photothermal lasers suggests that increased duration of tissue heating at the appropriate temperature results in more extensive collagen crosslinking and a stronger weld.\r"

Prepared for the study were pheophorbide a (Phd), dissolved in an oily contrast medium, Lipiodol (LPD-Phd), and water-soluble pheophorbide a (W-S Phd) as sensitizers, and VX-2 tumor in rabbit livers. The Phd distribution was compared after intraarterial (i.a.) administration of LPD-Phd or W-S Phd and intravenous (i.v.) administration of W-S Phd. Phd was extracted with methanol at 24 h after injection, and the supernatant absorbance was measured at 670 nm by spectrophotometry. The tumor showed higher values of Phd than did the liver with LPD-Phd i.a. and W-S Phd i.a. (P less than .01). Conversely, the tumor accumulated less Phd than did the liver with W-S Phd i.v. (P less than .05). We subsequently produced severe photo-destruction in a Walker tumor in a Sprague-Dawley rat liver with slight damage to adjacent liver tissue using LPD-Phd i.a. and Nd-YAG dye laser irradiation at 670 nm. The intraarterial administration of a photosensitizer may make it possible to treat liver tumors by photodynamic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We examined 20 punch biopsies taken from five patients at varying intervals following CO2 laser-induced thermal injury. The regenerating epidermis was studied with monoclonal antibodies AE1 and AE3 (directed against low and high molecular weight keratins), and involucrin, a protein found within the cellular envelope of the most mature keratinocytes. Twenty-four hours following thermal damage, there was extensive spillage of keratins and involucrin into the papillary dermis and disarray of all constituents of the necrotic keratinocytes. Early ingrowth of basaloid keratinocytes weakly expressed AE1. By 1 week, keratinocytes expressed AE1 in varying intensities throughout the epidermis. AE3 was present in its normal distribution, staining all but the most basaloid keratinocytes. Involucrin stained cells deep within the epidermis. Six weeks following the initial injury, the staining pattern within the epidermis had returned to normal. Thus, it appears that the regenerating epidermis produces low molecular weight keratins in cells at all levels and forms premature cellular envelopes, perhaps as a protective measure, before expression of these constituents reverts to the normal pattern. These findings suggest that keratinocyte differentiation in wound-healing following laser-induced thermal injury is similar to that seen in other types of injury. Observed clinical differences may be attributable to differences in keratinocyte proliferative or migratory capabilities.\r"

The smoke concentration was measured at 6 in and at 3 and 4 ft from site of laser interaction. The nozzle of the smoke evacuator was located at distances of 2, 6, and 12 in from the surgical site to measure the relative effectiveness of the control. Complete control of smoke was achieved when the nozzle was located at 2 in, but significant amounts of smoke escaped when the nozzle was located at 6 and 12 in. Suggestions for the use of the smoke evacuation system and areas for further study are given.\r"

This investigation sought to identify pretraining factors which may predispose to overuse injuries. Orthopedic and running history questionnaires and an orthopedic examination were administered to 505 trainees entering an intensive military training school. A novel method for evaluating ankle dorsiflexion was developed, and alignment measures, in units of centimeters rather than degrees, were obtained. Over 10% of the trainees were removed from the school for overuse-related injuries, and over half of these were tibial stress fractures. The incidence of clinically diagnosed stress fractures was 6.3%. No single orthopedic history question or combination of questions could discriminate between trainees who did or did not subsequently incur overuse injuries. Results from the running history indicated that those running 25 or more miles.wk-1 (mpw) had a significantly (P less than 0.027) lower incidence of stress fractures (3.0%) than those running 4 or fewer mpw over the previous year (11.5%). The orthopedic examination did not identify any predisposing alignment characteristics, perhaps due to the low incidence of overuse injuries. Population means are presented for future use in comparative studies.\r"

Twenty-five male and ten female subjects completed two sets of tests to determine quadriceps peak torque, rise time, time to fatigue, anaerobic power, and blood lactate accumulation. On one trial the subjects wore a Stromgren dual-hinged prophylactic knee brace. MANOVA analysis revealed that bracing did not significantly affect the performance of football players (males) but did inhibit the overall performance of lacrosse players (females) (P less than 0.05). Post hoc analyses determined that rise time (time to develop peak torque) was the greatest contributor among the dependent variables to the multivariate difference observed in the females. However, no isolated variable was identified as significantly different between the conditions by repeated-measures t-tests. Additional analyses disclosed that familiarity with brace wearing, order of testing, or a trial effect (i.e., learning) did not alter the performance results. It was concluded that wearing a protective knee brace does not improve performance and may inhibit performance in some asymptomatic athletes. It is suggested that athletes and coaches reexamine the use of prophylactic braces based upon these findings and other research described in this paper.\r"

The test subject again moves to the colored platform corresponding to the color indicated on the monitor until a series of 30 repetitions is completed. The groups tested were high school football and basketball, college football and basketball, and professional football teams. No statistically significant differences were noted between football and basketball. There was a significant difference between professional and amateur response times (P = 0.0001). Fifty percent of 180 amateur athletes had a response time greater than 2 SD slower than professional athletes. The response times may, therefore, be useful in determining athletic potential.\r"

Subjects underwent the following physical work capacity tests: the Wingate cycle ergometer test, the anaerobic speed test, the ventilatory threshold, VO2max, and maximal treadmill velocity during the VO2max test. Muscle biopsy samples pre- and post-treatment were obtained from 17 of the subjects, and these were assayed for citrate synthase and cytoplasmic alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups, and a double-blind method of administration of the supplements was used. The differences in improvement scores between the two groups on the work capacity and enzyme activity variables were statistically nonsignificant (P greater than 0.05). Serum ferritin values rose from a mean of 12.4 +/- 4.5 to 37.7 +/- 19.7 ng.ml-1 for the experimental group and from 12.2 +/- 4.3 to 17.2 +/- 8.9 ng.ml-1 for the controls (P = 0.0025), whereas hemoglobin levels remained fairly constant for both groups (P = 0.6). Eight weeks of iron supplementation to prelatent/latent iron-deficient, physically active females did not significantly enhance work capacity. Within the limitations of this study, the presence of a serum ferritin below 20 ng.ml-1 does not pose a significant handicap to physical work capacity.\r"

However, fructose was associated with lower plasma glucose and serum insulin, a larger loss of plasma volume, greater gastrointestinal distress and relative perceived exertion ratings, and higher plasma or serum concentrations of free fatty acids, fructose, and cortisol values than sucrose or glucose (P less than 0.05). Compared to sucrose and glucose, fructose feeding also resulted in lower lactate and HR values during the performance bout (P less than 0.05). Mean +/- SE cycling performance times were faster with sucrose and glucose than with fructose: 419.4 +/- 21.0 s, 423.9 +/- 21.2 s, and 488.3 +/- 21.1 s, respectively (P less than 0.05). Relative to 6% solutions of sucrose and glucose, ingestion of a 6% fructose beverage is associated with gastrointestinal distress, compromised physiological response, and reduced exercise capacity.\r"

For 19 consecutive days, 11 males were fed a weight maintenance, lactovegetarian diet which contained the Recommended Dietary Allowance (0.8g.kg-1.d-1) for protein. No exercise was performed for the first 7 d of the study. Subjects were strength tested on day 8 and performed upper and lower body weight training exercises from days 9-19. Complete, 24-h urine collections were obtained from each subject on a daily basis. Samples were assayed for creatinine and 3-MH. Stable baseline 3-MH values were present during the pre-exercise control period. Significant increases in 3-MH occurred by study day 11, which was the third day of weight training exercise. This was true regardless of whether the data were expressed by daily excretions (microM.d-1; P less than 0.01), per unit of body weight (microM.kg-1.d-1; P less than 0.005), or per unit of creatinine excretion (microM.g Creat-1.d-1; P less than 0.001). Since urinary 3-MH is an index of actin and myosin catabolism, these data support the hypothesis that the rate of skeletal muscle degradation is increased during strength building exercises.\r"

The chronic use of beta adrenergic blockers (BAB) has been associated with reductions in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and increases in triglycerides (TG). This study evaluated the impact of concurrent endurance exercise training and chronic medication with BAB on plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles in healthy young adult males. Changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins were investigated while exercise training under the influence of one of two nonselective BAB [sotalol (320 mg.d-1) and propranolol (160 mg.d-1)], one beta 1 selective BAB [atenolol (100 mg.d-1)], or a placebo control. Total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), TG, and the ratios of TC/HDL and LDL/HDL were determined before and after endurance training programs of either 14 (N = 27, sotalol) or 15 (N = 47, propranolol/atenolol) wk duration. The subjects exhibited increases in maximal oxygen uptake of 12-20%. Despite increased endurance capacity, the subjects in both BAB and placebo control groups failed to demonstrate the expected increase in HDL-C and decrease in TG. In fact, HDL-C was significantly decreased post-training in the propranolol group. The placebo groups did decrease TC, LDL-C and the TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios, improving their CHD risk profile. Similar changes were not observed in the groups on BAB. Thus, with respect to the present population, BAB does appear to interfere with the usual training-induced improvements in the lipid profile. Endurance training may, however, reduce the deterioration in the lipid profile known to occur with BAB.\r"

Mean (+/- SD) age was 66 +/- 5 yr in women and 66 +/- 6 yr in men. Only subjects with no history or physical examination findings of pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, or endocrine disease and normal electrocardiography and spirometry were studied. We found a linear relationship between Q and oxygen uptake (VO2) in males and females. The regression equation expressing this relationship in males was Q = 2.9 + 5 VO2 1.min-1 (SEE 2.8) and, in females, Q = 2.9 + 4.6 VO2 1.min-1 (SEE 2.8). This is similar to the relationship previously estimated for elderly males using the direct Fick method and concurs with other reports in the literature which show that, while the Q-VO2 relationship in the elderly has a slope similar to that in younger groups, the Q-VO2 intercept is lower. This means that the absolute level of cardiac output for a given level of work is lower in the elderly than in younger populations. This may reflect an age-related decrease in active metabolic tissue in the elderly and/or altered metabolic regulation with increased oxygen extraction from blood.\r"

To measure the effect of long-term squat training 27 male powerlifters (14 Elite or Master Class) and 28 male weightlifters (8 Elite or Master Class) were measured on the same tests. Powerlifters were significantly tighter than controls on the anterior drawer at 90 degrees of knee flexion. Both powerlifters and weightlifters were significantly tighter than controls on the quadriceps active drawer at 90 degrees of knee flexion. Data on powerlifters and weightlifters were also analyzed by years of experience and skill level. No effect of squat training on knee stability was demonstrated in any of the groups tested.\r"

At every test speed the Pearson product moment (r) and the Spearman rank (rs) correlation coefficients between the PT and PTAE were highly significant for both muscle groups in the uninjured (r = 0.79-0.94, rs = 0.78-0.94) as well as in the ACL-insufficient (r = 0.87-0.95, rs = 0.83-0.94) knees. The results were the same between the PT and AP (uninjured: r = 0.70-0.90, rs = 0.68-0.90; ACL insufficient: r = 0.86-0.93, rs = 0.82-0.93). In both knees and in both muscle groups the correlation coefficients increased simultaneously with the speed of movement, obviously since the PTAE and AP were registered at the highest test speed (180 degrees.s-1). In conclusion, concerning ACL-insufficient or uninjured knees, the PTAE or AP analysis may offer little additional information about thigh muscle function to that attained by more simple measurement, the PT analysis.\r"

Carefully selected patients with documented coronary artery disease were randomly allocated either to a control group (N = 10) or to 12 wk of endurance exercise training (N = 12); both progressive incremental cycle ergometer testing (maximal power output and peak VO2) and 30 s maximal isokinetic cycle ergometry (peak power, total work, and fatigue index) were measured on entry into the study and 12 wk later. Initial maximum performance measures in progressive incremental exercise and in maximal short-term isokinetic cycling were similar in both groups. Following the training program, maximum power output measured during progressive incremental exercise increased by 21% (P less than 0.005) and peak VO2 increased by 18% (P less than 0.005) in the exercise group, but they were unchanged in the control group. Isokinetic peak power and total work improved by 14% (P less than 0.001) and 11%, respectively, in the exercise group, whereas there were corresponding reductions of 6 and 8% in the control subjects, with little change in fatigue index in either group. The similar relative increases in isokinetic peak power and peak VO2 suggest that improvement in short-term exercise capacity may be an important contributor to the improvement in aerobic exercise tolerance frequently observed in cardiac patients undergoing an endurance exercise program.\r"

The technique proved safe and reproducible in these patients. In relation to normal standards, performance was better in the maximal isokinetic cycle ergometer test (peak power = 819 +/- 116 W; average power = 532 +/- 72 W; total work = 13.1 +/- 2.1 kJ; 95-101% of predicted) than in the progressive incremental exercise test (VO2 = 1.80 +/- 0.37 l.min-1; power output = 919 +/- 165 kpm.min-1; 70-80% of predicted). Beta blockade did not affect maximal performance during either isokinetic or progressive incremental cycling, although maximal heart rate was significantly lower during both tests in patients on beta blockade. Power output in the progressive exercise was not as strongly related to the indices measured during the 30 s isokinetic test (r = 0.59-0.63) as it was in previous studies of healthy individuals (r = 0.89). The ability to detect individual variations in short-term exercise capacity measured with maximal isokinetic cycle ergometry may have significant potential value 1) as an additional method of determining the limitations to exercise and 2) when executing an exercise prescription in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

Thirteen moderately to highly conditioned (VO2max = 59.7 +/- 5.3 ml.kg-1.min-1; VO2 at 2.0 mmol.l-1 of plasma lactate = 46.6 +/- 4.1 ml.kg-1.min-1) female runners between the ages of 18 and 33 yr volunteered to participate. All subjects performed the laboratory tests and the 5 km, 10 km, and 16.09 km competitive time trials on an outdoor 5 km course. The correlation coefficients (r) between each race pace and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), speed (s) at 2.0 mmol.l-1 plasma lactate accumulation (PLA2s), and speed at 4.0 mmol.l-1 plasma lactate accumulation (PLA4s) ranged between 0.84 and 0.94. The oxygen costs of running at each of the three submaximal paces were correlated moderately with each race pace (r = -0.40 to -0.63). Hierarchal stepwise multiple regression analyses produced equations with two independent variables which explained 94 to 97% of the variability in race performance.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of a triathlon wet suit on drag was studied in 12 subjects (eight male, four female) swimming at different velocities (1.10, 1.25 and 1.50 m.s-1). The active drag force was directly measured during front crawl swimming using a system of underwater push off pads instrumented with a force transducer (M.A.D. system: 6). Measurements were made when swimming over the system with and without a wet suit. A 14% reduction in drag (from 48.7 to 41.8 Newtons) is found at a swimming velocity of 1.25 m.s-1, which is a typical swimming speed for triathlon distances. At 1.50 m.s-1 a reduction in drag of 12% was observed, which suggests that the wearing of such a suit might be beneficial in conventional swimming events. The reduction in drag can explain the higher swimming velocities observed in triathletes using a wet suit. The effect of the reduction is probably largely due to an increased buoyancy inducing less frontal resistance. However, since the effect of the suit on the lighter female swimmers was not different from the effect on the heavier male swimmers, a reduction in friction drag and drag coefficient may also be significant.\r"

Sport Tester readings taken during three 3-min exercise loads were correlated from 0.97 to 0.99 with simultaneously recorded ECG heart rates. In study 2, 23 children from 4 to 6 yr of age performed treadmill exercise for three 1-min intervals while Sport Tester and ECG heart rate data were obtained. Correlations for the three intervals ranged from 0.94 to 0.99. Study 3 obtained ECG and Sport Tester heart rates in 14 7- to 9-yr-olds who engaged in 3-min periods of standing, walking, jogging, throwing a ball, batting a ball, and playing on a jungle gym. Significant correlations of at least 0.98 between Sport Tester and ECG heart rates were obtained during all six activities. For all three studies, standard errors of estimate were low, ranging from 1.1 to 3.7 beats.min-1. For individuals, maximum differences ranged from 0 to 12.4 beats.min-1. Collectively, these findings indicate that the Sport Tester provides valid readings of young children's heart rates across a wide range of exercise involving upper- and lower-body movements.\r"

In the laboratory study 16 healthy subjects performed a number of specified exercises within a range of activity levels that may be expected in normal life. Accelerometer output was compared with energy expenditure measured by continuous respirometry. A linear relationship was found between accelerometer output and energy expenditure for the pooled data. The standard error of estimate is 79.1 J.min-1.kg-1. In the field study four subjects were observed during a week under free living conditions. Energy expenditure was calculated from food intake registered over the whole period. Energy expenditure calculated from accelerometer output and heart rate exceeded the energy intake figures by 30% and 33%, respectively. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. Despite this discrepancy, accelerometer output appeared to correlate highly with energy intake (r = 0.99, P less than 0.025), which suggests accurate performance of the accelerometer under free living conditions. The heart rate method gave much poorer results in estimating individual energy expenditure.\r"

Low levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 that fail to respond to growth hormone suggest a possible deficiency of growth hormone receptors. The high-affinity growth hormone-binding protein is a fragment of the growth hormone receptor and may be an indicator of the number of receptors in tissues. We measured growth hormone-binding activity in plasma from 20 pygmies and 12 control subjects (7 white Americans and 5 non-Pygmy black Africans of normal stature). Growth hormone binding to the high-affinity binding protein was significantly reduced in the Pygmies as compared with the controls (mean +/- SD, 6.50 +/- 2.33 percent vs. 12.95 +/- 3.95 percent bound per 160 microliters of plasma; P less than 0.001); however, there was substantial overlap between the values for Pygmies and controls. Growth hormone binding to the low-affinity binding protein was similar in Pygmies and control subjects. We conclude that Pygmies have low levels of high-affinity growth hormone-binding protein in their plasma, which may indicate a reduced number of growth hormone receptors in their tissues. The finding may help explain the resistance to growth in Pygmies, but there may be additional reasons, related to the receptors or not, for their short stature.\r"

Risk factors predisposing patients to infection were comparable in the two groups. Nosocomial colonization occurred later among isolated patients (median, vs. 7 days; P less than 0.01) and was associated with subsequent infection in 12 patients, as compared with 12 patients given standard care (P = 0.01). Among patients who were isolated, the interval before the first infection was significantly longer than (median, 20 vs. 8 days; P = 0.04), the daily infection rate was 2.2 times lower than (95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 4.0; P = 0.007), and there were fewer days with fewer (13 percent vs. 21 percent; P = 0.001). The benefit of isolation was most notable after seven days of intensive care. Isolation was well tolerated by patients and their families. Regular monitoring showed that the children in each group were touched and handled comparably often by hospital personnel and family members. We conclude that the use of disposable, high-barrier gowns and gloves for the care of selected, high-risk children who require prolonged intensive care significantly reduces the incidence of nosocomial infection, is well tolerated, and does not compromise the delivery of care.\r"

Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of such transfer in hypothyroid rats. To determine whether there is a transfer of thyroxine (T4) from mother to fetus, we studied 25 neonates born with a complete inability to iodinate thyroid proteins and therefore to synthesize T4. This total organification defect is an autosomal recessive disorder with an incidence of approximately 1 in 60,000 neonates in the Netherlands. In the cord serum of affected neonates, T4 levels ranged from 35 to 70 nmol per liter. Since these patients were unable to produce any T4, the T4 must have originated in their mothers. The estimated biologic half-life of serum T4 was 3.6 days (95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 5.3). In 15 neonates with thyroid agenesis, the serum levels and the disappearance kinetics of T4 were the same as those in the neonates with a total organification defect, suggesting that in these infants, the T4 also had a maternal origin. We conclude that in infants with severe congenital hypothyroidism, substantial amounts of T4 are transferred from mother to fetus during late gestation.\r"

  ".U": "89281659\r", 
  ".W": "It has been suggested that the use of financial incentives by health maintenance organizations (HMOs) may change physicians' behavior toward individual patients. To test this hypothesis, we used a regression analysis of data from a survey of HMOs to examine the relation between the presence of financial incentives and two measures of the use of resources (the rate of hospitalization and the rate of visits for outpatient services) and one measure of the HMOs' financial viability (the achievement of break-even status). When we controlled for the effect of market-area variables, we found that some forms of compensation were significantly associated with these indicators of decision making by physicians. Among methods of paying physicians, the use of capitation or salaries was associated with a lower rate of hospitalization than the use of fee-for-service payment; physicians in for-profit HMOs and group-model HMOs also used the hospital less often. Placing physicians at financial risk as individuals and imposing penalties for deficits in the HMO's hospital fund beyond the loss of withheld funds were associated with fewer outpatient visits per enrollee, but a higher percentage of HMO patients in a physician's caseload was associated with more frequent visits. HMOs were more likely to break even if they were larger, older, had physicians who treated more HMO patients, and placed physicians at personal financial risk for the cost of outpatient tests; break-even status was also related to the type of HMO. We conclude that the use of some, but not all, financial incentives, as well as the type of HMO, does influence the behavior of physicians toward patients. It remains to be determined how these factors affect the quality of care.\r"

  ".W": "The pituitary gland, composed of the anterior, intermediate and posterior lobe, represents a principal regulatory interface through which the central nervous system controls body physiology. The ontogeny of the growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (Prl) producing cells of the anterior pituitary has been analysed in transgenic mice, using the thymidine kinase obliteration system (TKO). Cells expressing the herpes virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-TK) gene acquire pharmacological sensitivity to synthetic nucleosides such as FIAU (1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-delta-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil), whose metabolites kill dividing cells. Consequently we created transgenic mice carrying the HSV1-TK gene under the control of either the rat growth hormone or the rat prolactin promoter. If transgenic mice expressing HSV1-TK in somatotropes (GH-producing cells) are treated with FIAU, they develop as dwarfs. The anterior pituitary in these animals is nearly devoid of both somatotropes and lactotropes (Prl-producing cells). By contrast, transgenic mice expressing HSV1-TK in the lactotropes, treated with FIAU, have anatomically and histologically normal pituitaries. Because toxicity depends on cell division, we conclude that Prl expression and lactotrope differentiation are post-mitotic events. These results indicate that both somatotropes and lactotropes derive from a common GH-expressing stem-somatotrope. Unexpectedly, the stemsomatotrope is still present in the adult animal and is capable of repopulating the pituitaries of treated animals with mature GH and Prl producing cells.\r"

Using the cloned retinoblastoma gene and other linked polymorphic loci, it is possible to reconstruct the sequential loss of the two homologous gene copies that precedes the development of these tumours. In non-hereditary tumours, the loss of each of the two homologues occurs somatically; in hereditary cases, the initial mutation is in the germline. Recently, Toguchida et al. reported that the paternally derived copy is preferentially the first one to become mutant during the genesis of non-hereditary osteosarcomas. We report here a similar analysis of patients with retinoblastoma in which we find no such predilection for initial somatic mutations. In contrast, when an initial mutation was a new germline mutation, it was derived from the father, a result which is consistent with new germline mutations arising primarily during spermatogenesis.\r"

Many of these mutations occur at the same few genetic loci (frequency (frq) in the fungus Neurospora, and period (per) in fruit fly Drosophila); these loci represent the best studied clock-affecting genes known. Mutant strains are usually affected in more than one basic clock property, suggesting an inter-relatedness at the molecular level among these basic properties that would not have been predicted a priori. The extensive background information available concerning the frq locus provides a basis for the molecular dissection of the Neurospora circadian clock--the most minimal circadian system thus far described. We report here the cloning and analysis of the frq locus and show it to be larger and more complex than would have been predicted from the available genetic data. Complete rescue of all of the pleiotropic mutant phenotypes of the recessive frq allele requires transformation with a 7.7-kilobase (kb) region of DNA encoding at least two transcripts. Sequence analysis of this region has allowed the identification of a common element between frq and per which, given the background similarities in their classical genetic characteristics, suggests the possibility of a common element in the clock mechanisms of these two organisms.\r"

A complementary DNA analysis of the protein has revealed extensive amino-acid sequence homology to the products of a set of genes recently identified in organisms as diverse as Escherichia coli and man, which include the eukaryotic translation initiation factor elF-4A. The protein products of the new gene family have several motifs in common which are thought to be involved in nucleic acid unwinding. As yet, however, only elF-4A, through its effect on RNA, has been shown to possess unwinding activity. Here we report that purified p68 also exhibits RNA-dependent ATPase activity and functions as an RNA helicase in vitro. The protein was first identified by its specific immunological cross reaction with the simian virus 40 large T antigen, the transforming protein of a small DNA tumour virus. Surprisingly, T antigen also has an RNA-unwinding activity: the homology between the two polypeptides, although confined to only a small region resembling the epitope of the cross-reacting antibody (PAb204), should therefore be of functional significance. Furthermore, the RNA-unwinding activity may be involved in the growth-regulating functions of both proteins.\r"

Thus, v-erbA may be the first example of a dominant negative oncogene.\r"

Techniques for studying oligodendrocyte development in vitro can be used, indirectly, to investigate the myelin injury that occurs in human and experimental demyelinating disease. Cell-mediated immune mechanisms are necessary but not sufficient to induce myelin damage in vivo; more recently complement has also been implicated in the pathogenesis both of multiple sclerosis and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Previously we have demonstrated that antibody-independent complement activation occurs in vitro at the oligodendrocyte surface. Here we show that the ensuing oligodendrocyte injury is reversible, and that recovery involves the release of membrane-attack complex-enriched vesicles from the surface of viable cells. The demonstration of morphologically and immunochemically identical vesicles in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis suggests that reversible complement-mediated injury contributes to myelin damage in vivo.\r"

Transfer experiments involving synthetic genes and in vitro binding studies have shown that progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors both recognize the same 15-base pair DNA element (TGTACAGGATGTTCT), raising the question of how the two steroids affect gene expression selectively. We considered the possibility that their selectivity arises from either the differential expression of the receptors in target cells or the differential dependence of receptor function on additional transcription factors. To test these alternatives we introduced a progesterone-receptor expression plasmid into the rat hepatoma cell line Fto2B-3 which contains glucocorticoid receptor but is devoid of progesterone receptor. We report that expression of the progesterone receptor in Fto2B-3 cells renders endogenous glucocorticoid-regulated genes inducible by progestins. Our data show that the responsiveness of a cell to external stimuli can be reprogrammed by the expression of a single transcription factor and that differential expression of hormone receptors is at least one mechanism by which steroid-specific gene activation is achieved.\r"

  ".W": "As a family of structurally-related enzymes, cytochrome P450 (P450) monooxygenases exhibit paradoxical characteristics: although collectively the enzymes display a broad range of substrate specificities, individually they are characterized by a high degree of substrate and product selectivity. Mouse P45015 alpha and P450coh, for example, which are expressed in female liver and male kidney cells, catalyse 15 alpha-hydroxylation of delta 4 3-ketone steroids, such as testosterone and 7-hydroxylation of coumarin, respectively. In spite of their divergent catalytic activities, however, these enzymes differ by only 11 amino acids within their 494 residues. To determine the structural basis of the different substrate specificities of P45015 alpha and P450coh we therefore altered each of these 11 residues by site-directed mutagenesis, expressing the mutant cytochromes in COS-1 cells. We report that the activities of both cytochromes depend critically on the identities of the amino acids at positions 117, 209 and 365 and, moreover, that a single mutation in which Phe 209 is substituted by Leu is sufficient to convert the specificity of P450coh from coumarin to steroid hydroxylation.\r"

They consist of (GnTm) or (GnATm) motifs (n greater than or equal to m) and, in the single-stranded state, form hairpins stabilized by non-canonical G.G pairs. In the duplex state and under superhelical stress they exhibit hypersensitivity to SI nuclease which by analogy with homopurine-homopyrimidine sequences may reflect the formation of an unusual structure. To determine whether this is the case we have inserted into a plasmid the Tetrahymena telomeric motif (G4T2).(A2C4) and probed it by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, chemical modification and oligonucleotide binding. Our data demonstrate that, under superhelical stress and at low pH, the insert does indeed adopt a novel DNA conformation. We have concluded that in this structure the C-rich strand forms a hairpin stabilized by non-Watson-Crick base pairs C.C+ and A.A+, whereas the G-rich strand remains unstructured. We term this new DNA structure the (C,A)-hairpin.\r"

From fibre diffraction data, models for triplex structures with poly(U).poly(A).poly(U) and poly(dT).poly(dA).poly(dT) have been proposed, in which the purine and one pyrimidine strand are Watson-Crick paired in an A' helix, and the other pyrimidine strand is Hoogsteen base-paired parallel to the purine strand along the major groove. A similar base-pairing scheme involving G and C would require protonation of C for Hoogsteen base-pair formation, and models for such triplexes have been proposed by analogy to the single-sequence fibre diffraction data. To date, however, there have been no single crystal or NMR structural data on DNA triplexes, and no direct observation of the protonated C in such a context. We present here the first NMR evidence for triplex formation in DNA from the homopurine d(G-A) and homopyrimidine d(T-C) oligonucleotides, and report direct observation of imino protons from protonated cytosines in the triplex.\r"

Even after adjusting for multiple confounding factors, women whose inter-pregnancy interval was 18 or fewer months (over one-third of women in the cohort) remained at twice the risk of giving birth to a term SGA infant when compared with women whose inter-pregnancy interval was 24-36 months. In a logistic regression analysis examining the occurrence of SGA birth in women with inter-pregnancy intervals of 36 months or less, a strong linear association was noted between these two factors. The association of term SGA birth with short inter-pregnancy interval could result from one or more physiologic factors that might act to limit fetal growth. In that case, short inter-pregnancy interval would represent a potentially preventable cause of SGA birth.\r"

A \"pre-residency syndrome\" has been described in the literature, wherein fourth-year medical students take multiple rotations in the specialty in which they are seeking residency training.

Plasma digoxin-like immunoreactive factor was measured in 113 third-trimester patients: 51 normotensives, 20 preeclamptics, 19 with latent or chronic hypertension, and 23 with twin pregnancies. The concentration of total digoxin-like immunoreactive factor in the twin gestations (1143 +/- 249 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that in either the normotensive pregnancies (890 +/- 161 pg/mL) (P less than .001) or in the hypertensive pregnancies (903 +/- 256 pg/mL) (P less than .01). However, there were no significant differences in digoxin-like immunoreactive factor levels between the normotensive and hypertensive groups. A trend of higher, although not statistically significant, levels of digoxin-like immunoreactive factor was noted in the chronic hypertensive group as compared with the preeclamptic patients (957 +/- 212 versus 852 +/- 288 pg/mL). We therefore conclude that digoxin-like immunoreactive factor does not contribute significantly to the pathogenesis or prediction of preeclampsia. The increased amount of digoxin-like immunoreactive factor in twin pregnancies may reflect a contribution from multifetal origin, or might be a physiologic adaptive mechanism allowing higher cardiac output by a possible cardiotropic effect.\r"

  ".W": "Loss of sino-aortic baroreceptor reflex sensitivity has been associated with various forms of hypertension. Baroreflexive dysfunction antedates elevation of blood pressure (BP) in some forms of hypertension, and may play a role in their pathogenesis. We studied baroreflex function in seven women with severe preeclampsia being treated with intravenous hydralazine. As indices of baroreflex sensitivity and hemodynamic competence, we measured the reflexive elevations in heart rate (HR) (delta HR/delta BP) and cardiac index (CI) (delta CI/delta BP) in response to hydralazine-induced falls in blood pressure. The change in cardiac index per unit change in systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (delta CI/delta SVRI) served as an additional measure of hemodynamic competence. The results indicated that a higher baseline blood pressure was associated with a dramatic reduction in baroreflex sensitivity (delta HR/delta BP) and baroreflex control of blood pressure (delta CI/delta BP and delta CI/delta SVRI). In patients with higher baseline blood pressures, the severe impairment of baroreflex function eliminated the normal circulatory buffer against vasodilator-induced hypotension. Abrupt and profound reductions in blood pressure and the development of fetal distress in response to hydralazine occurred in the patients with higher initial blood pressures. In addition, the present results suggest that phenomena such as the blood pressure lability and increased responsiveness to angiotensin that characterize preeclampsia are, at least in part, reflections of baroreflex dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "To quantitate the effect of advancing pregnancy on the screening test for gestational diabetes, 550 patients were given a 50-g oral glucose screening test at 20, 28, and 34 weeks' gestation. A significant increase in the plasma glucose value was found, with a mean increase of 1.1 +/- 1.9 mg/dL per week from 20-34 weeks' gestation (r = 0.39, P less than .01). Only 34 patients (6.2%) had a positive screening test at 20 weeks' gestation, and it appears that routine screening in a low-risk population at 20 weeks is not warranted. Sixty patients (10.9%) with a negative screening test at 20 weeks had a positive test at 28 weeks. Forty-four patients (8.0%) with a negative test at 28 weeks had a subsequent positive test at 34 weeks. The overall incidence of gestational diabetes in this population was 4.9%. Currently, screening is recommended at 24-28 weeks for all pregnancies that have not been previously identified as having glucose intolerance. Eleven percent of the gestational diabetics in our population would have been undetected had we screened only at 24-28 weeks. This quantitative information may be helpful in deciding whether rescreening later in pregnancy is indicated.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes the use of maternal pelvic and fetal models, a tactile sensing glove, and a microcomputer data acquisition system to measure fetal shoulder extraction forces. Sixty-nine experiments were carried out in the laboratory setting to simulate vaginal delivery of the aftercoming fetal shoulders. The tests were conducted using a variety of fetal biclavicular diameters (10-13 cm) and maternal pelvic angle positions (McRoberts, 10 degrees; lithotomy, 25 degrees). When comparing lithotomy versus McRoberts positioning, there was a consistent reduction in force needed to extract the fetal shoulders with the latter maneuver. No simulated clavicles were fractured during shoulder delivery until a biclavicular diameter of 12.0 cm was reached. At this point, five of eight clavicles (63%) were fractured at 25 degrees and zero of seven (0%) were fractured at 10 degrees (P less than .025). For all 69 experiments, fetal neck extension readings were consistently lower than the total traction forces recorded by the tactile sensing glove. This suggests that, in addition to the axially oriented fetal neck forces, a component of flexion (lateral force) was also present. As the difficulty of shoulder delivery increased, the impact of these inadvertent flexion forces became most pronounced at the level of the brachial plexus. This is the first study to measure shoulder extraction forces reproducibly using a laboratory model for shoulder dystocia and to describe the pathophysiology of specific neonatal injuries from a force perspective. The results document objectively that McRoberts positioning reduces shoulder extraction forces, brachial plexus stretching, and the incidence of clavicular fracture.\r"

  ".W": "In pregnancy, an increase in serum calcitriol and parathyroid hormone concentrations has been reported in several studies, though the increase in parathyroid hormone remains controversial. In magnesium deficiency states, parathyroid hormone and calcitriol secretion may be decreased. Because magnesium deficiency may occur in insulin-dependent diabetic patients, mainly because of urinary magnesium losses, we hypothesized that serum parathyroid hormone and calcitriol do not increase in the diabetic pregnancy. We studied, in a prospective longitudinal manner, 35 nondiabetic and 199 insulin-dependent diabetic pregnancies. In diabetic women, the goals of glycemic control were fasting blood glucose below 100 mg/dL and postprandial blood glucose less than 140 mg/dL. Serum magnesium, calcium, parathyroid hormone (whole molecule; ie, 1-84 fragment), and calcitriol were measured three times: 1) 8-12 weeks, 2) 22-28 weeks, and 3) 32-38 weeks' gestation. In normal women, serum parathyroid hormone did not change significantly over pregnancy, and a wide scatter of values was observed. Serum calcitriol increased significantly with advancing gestation. In diabetic women, serum parathyroid hormone had a narrow scatter, but values were within the low-normal range. During the third trimester there was no increase, and even a decrease, in serum calcitriol concentrations. Diabetics had, throughout pregnancy, significantly reduced serum magnesium concentrations when compared with controls. Their serum calcium and ionized calcium concentrations were similar to those of controls, except in the third trimester, when diabetic women had significantly lower serum calcium and ionized calcium concentrations than controls. We speculate that mineral metabolism abnormalities in diabetic pregnancies might be due to relative magnesium and/or insulin deficiency.\r"

After becoming aware of AIDS, 59 changed their sexual habits, 41 decreased their number of sexual partners, and 13 who had not used condoms started using them. However, only seven obtained more information about their partners' sexual and social histories, and half of those who decreased their number of partners still continued relationships with more than one. The survey showed that the publicity about AIDS has resulted in a favorable change in the sexual practices of these teenagers. However, it also indicated a need for further improvement in specific areas of education, such as the value of obtaining more information about sexual partners, more awareness of the importance of multiple-partner relationships in the spread of AIDS, and more emphasis on the important role of condoms in preventing AIDS virus transmission.\r"

We studied weight gain during pregnancy and pregnancy outcome in a cohort of 1790 teenage gravidas from Camden, New Jersey. We found that early inadequate weight gain (less than 4.3 kg by 24 weeks' gestation) was associated with a significantly increased risk of having a small for gestational age infant (adjusted odds ratio 1.88; 95% confidence interval 1.08-3.27), even when later gains brought the cumulative total weight gain to within adult standards. Late inadequate gains (less than 400 g/week) were associated significantly with preterm delivery (before 37 completed weeks' gestation), whether or not the total gain was adequate for gestation (adjusted odds ratio 1.69; 95% confidence interval 1.12-2.55). These results suggest that supplementation, intervention, or prenatal care protocols for adolescents that do not focus on balanced weight gain during adolescent pregnancy may reduce preterm delivery but may not significantly affect the incidence of intrauterine growth retardation.\r"

The average urethral pressure fall was preceded by a 6-cm increase in maximum urethral pressure. The mean (+/- SD) fall of urethral pressure was 30 +/- 12 cm H2O and the average duration of the event was 8 seconds. The level of the urethral pressure fall was not influenced by bladder volume but correlated positively with higher maximum urethral pressures. The present findings suggest that the unstable urethra plays a limited role in genuine stress incontinence but may be linked with the unstable detrusor.\r"

However, those disabled after menarche were significantly less likely (P = .001) to be satisfied with the counseling or method they received. Women with paralysis, impaired motor function, obvious physical deformity were rarely offered contraceptive information or methods. These findings may be related in part to the characteristics of the patient group. However, we suggest that special attention needs to be directed to those disabled after menarche with respect to issues such as sexuality and contraception. This can be accomplished in part through improved education of health professionals regarding the various aspects of gynecologic health care for the disabled.\r"

Patients with embryonal rhadomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides) were excluded because these pediatric tumors are now treated with less radical operative procedures, plus radiation and chemotherapy. Six patients had exenteration as primary treatment, and three patients had exenteration as secondary treatment. Four patients developed recurrent disease (mean 5.2 months), and all four died of disease. Five patients were alive at 5 and 10 years, for an absolute survival of 55%. All three patients with mixed mesodermal tumors died of recurrent disease, compared with 83% survival for patients with other sarcoma types.

In this randomized study of 182 patients, we report the effects of delayed versus early induction of labor on maternal and neonatal outcome. Qualifying patients not in labor at 6 hours after spontaneous rupture of membranes were randomized to either immediate oxytocin induction (86 women) or expectant management with oxytocin induction at 24 hours if labor had not occurred spontaneously (96 women). The cesarean section rate did not differ between the two groups. Women in the delayed group had significantly longer hospitalization (P less than .003), and their infants were significantly more likely to receive antibiotics (P = .006). Infectious morbidity (positive cultures or x-ray-documented pneumonia) occurred in five of the neonates in the delayed group, all of whose mothers had an initial digital cervical examination, but in none of the neonates in the early group, a difference that did not reach statistical significance (P = .061). Five (28%) of 18 infants from the delayed group whose mothers had received an initial digital cervical examination became infected, compared with none of the 78 infants from the delayed group whose mothers did not have digital examinations (P less than .001).

Individual evaluation of each twin for intrauterine growth retardation using singleton growth curves was more effective than discordancy and other classifications in predicting neonatal morbidity. Our findings suggest that evaluation of twin growth should concentrate on individual twin growth rather than discordancy. These results also speak against interpreting growth curves based on twins in the same way as growth curves based on singletons; it is apparent that the frequency of growth retardation with associated neonatal morbidity is increased among twins.\r"

However, although visual results of IOL implantation are vastly superior to aphakic spectacle correction after cataract surgery, several factors mitigate against the widespread implantation of IOLs in most developing nations: the high cost of surgical equipment, ancillary drugs, and intraocular lenses; difficulty in postoperative follow-up of cataract surgical patients; and a dearth of surgical personnel properly trained in IOL technology in developing nations. While many of these problems could be addressed through national initiatives, a major area of concern remains that of manpower, since the number of unoperated cataract patients is immense. One strategy for alternative surgical manpower development is the training of medical assistants to perform cataract surgery, as is presently being carried out in several African nations. The question arises, however, as to whether medical assistants, as opposed to ophthalmologists, are qualified to select patients and implant IOLs.\r"

Two lenses did not meet optical resolution standards. Most of the lenses (80%) had some surface or loop surface abnormality as judged by scanning electron microscopy. Four of the lenses had surface protrusions or burrs, either at the tip of the loop or at the lens-optic junction. These more serious defects could be seen easily at magnifications of the operating microscope. The lenses with serious structural defects tended to be the same as those lenses with functional (optical) defects. This study demonstrates the usefulness of careful intraoperative examination using the operating microscope prior to intraocular lens implantation to detect manufacturing defects which continue to exist in currently manufactured lenses. Lens inspection should be directed to the ends of the loops, the loop-optic junction, and the internal surface of the positioning holes.\r"

Nineteen of 22 vitrectomized eyes of white New Zealand rabbits injected with this purified perfluorophenanthrene showed satisfactory clinical tolerance. Light and electron microscopy showed minimal or no toxic effects in the 19 eyes, although uptake of perfluorophenanthrene by some preretinal cells was observed 28 days after implantation. Postoperative light-adapted electroretinography recordings of eight of the injected eyes showed no significant change. Perfluorophenanthrene injected into the anterior chamber of the rabbit eyes had toxic effects on the cornea. If further experimentations confirm our findings, perfluorophenanthrene may be a suitable transparent high-density liquid for temporary use in surgery to repair retinal detachments.\r"

Whereas RNA duplex formation between the downstream spacer element and the U7 small nuclear RNA is essential for processing, we show here that base pairing between the histone stem-loop structure and the U7 RNA is not relevant. Our experiments demonstrate that a processing factor other than the U7 RNA makes contact with the highly conserved hairpin structure of the histone precursor. The recognition of the target site by the processing factor is structure and sequence specific. Prevention of this interaction results in an 80% decrease of 3' cleavage efficiency in vitro. The hairpin binding factor is Sm-precipitable and can be partially separated from the U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle on a Mono Q column.\r"

D-Allose, an all-cis hexose, mediates a vigorous curb of the transport system. Moreover, prolonged coincubation of glucose or allose with tunicamycin (TM) brings about an additional effect that is not an inhibition of the transport system, which we shall call the \"concerted\" transport curb. This type of concerted transport curb requires L-glutamine in the maintenance medium; moreover, addition of cycloheximide prevents the development of this TM effect. Apparently, cellular protein synthesis or protein turnover or both are required for the development of the TM-concerted transport curb. The concerted transport curb can be reversed in sugar-free or in fructose-containing medium, even upon readdition of TM. In contrast, the sole readdition of glucose or D-allose renders the concerted curb irreversible. This raises the question of whether the cells under the condition of the concerted curb somehow have internalized the TM into the membrane.\r"

E2F activity is undetectable in HeLa extracts but upon incubation with a fraction from adenovirus-infected cells, there is an ATP-dependent increase in E2F DNA binding activity. This increase does not occur using an equivalent fraction from dl312 (E1A-)-infected cells. Incubation of E2F with phosphatase inactivates E2F binding activity. Incubation of the phosphatase-inactivated E2F with an infected cell fraction restores E2F activity as does incubation with a known protein kinase. In contrast, incubation with an extract from mock-infected cells does not restore activity. We conclude that the DNA binding activity of E2F is regulated by phosphorylation in an E1A-dependent manner.\r"

In addition, we have used this method to show that C. elegans contains at least five different sequences homologous to genes in the tyrosine kinase family.

We have sequenced selected restriction fragments of a Syrian hamster CAD cDNA that are clearly homologous to three prokaryotic ATCases. These studies, combined with previous sequence data, showed that the ATCase domain of CAD is encoded by 924 base pairs and has a mass of 34,323 Da and a pI of 9.8. While the bacterial pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes are separate proteins, in mammals the ATCase domain is fused to the carboxyl end of the CAD chimera via a 133-amino acid (14-kDa) linker with an unusual amino acid composition, a pI of 10.2, and pronounced hydrophilic character. The fully active domain isolated from proteolytic digests was characterized by partial amino acid sequencing and amino acid analysis. Trypsin cleavage produced the ATCase domain with a 20-residue amino-terminal extension. Hydrodynamic studies showed that the isolated domain is a 110-kDa trimer with a Stokes radius of 41 A.

We report here on the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the alpha-subunit of the enzyme from human tumor HT-1080, placenta, and fibroblast cDNA libraries. Eight overlapping clones covering almost all of the corresponding 3000-nucleotide mRNA, including all the coding sequences, were characterized. These clones encode a polypeptide of 517 amino acid residues and a signal peptide of 17 amino acids. Previous characterization of cDNA clones for the beta-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase has indicated that its C terminus has the amino acid sequence Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu, which, it has been suggested, is necessary for the retention of a polypeptide within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The alpha-subunit does not have this C-terminal sequence, and thus one function of the beta-subunit in the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer appears to be to retain the enzyme within this cell organelle. Interestingly, three of the cDNA clones for the alpha-subunit contained a 64-nucleotide sequence homologous but not identical to the corresponding 64-nucleotide sequence found in four other cDNA clones. Nuclease S1 mapping experiments demonstrated that this difference was due to the existence of two types of mRNA present in approximately equal amounts. Southern blot analyses of human genomic DNA with a cDNA probe for the alpha-subunit suggested the presence of only one gene encoding the two types of mRNA, which appear to result from mutually exclusive alternative splicing of primary transcripts of one gene.\r"

The repair was accompanied by a mismatch-stimulated and mismatch-localized DNA synthesis. Repaired molecules, separated from unrepaired molecules, showed a 20- to 100-fold increase in DNA synthesis in the region of the mismatch compared to regions distant from the mismatch. The remaining unrepaired heteroduplex DNA included molecules that also displayed mismatch-stimulated DNA synthesis in the mismatch-proximal regions. These may represent intermediates in the repair process. The patterns of DNA synthesis suggest that repair begins at some distance from the mismatch and that as much as 1 kilobase or more can be involved in the mismatch-stimulated synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The structures of crystalline D-xylose isomerase (D-xylose ketol-isomerase; EC 5.3.1.5) from Streptomyces rubiginosus and of its complexes with substrate and with an active-site-directed inhibitor have been determined by x-ray diffraction techniques and refined to 1.9-A resolution. This study identifies the active site, as well as two metal-binding sites. The metal ions are important in maintaining the structure of the active-site region and one of them binds C3-O and C5-O of the substrate forming a six-membered ring. This study has revealed a very close contact between histidine and C1 of a substrate, suggesting that this is the active-site base that abstracts a proton from substrate. The mechanism-based inhibitor is a substrate analog and is turned over by the enzyme to give a product that alkylates this same histidine, reinforcing our interpretation. The changes in structure of the native enzyme, the enzyme with bound substrate, and the alkylated enzyme indicate that the mechanism involves an \"open-chain\" conformation of substrate and that the intermediate in the isomerization reaction is probably a cis-ene diol because the active-site histidine is correctly placed to abstract a proton from C1 or C2 of the substrate. A water molecule binds to C1O and C2O of the substrate and so may act as a proton donor or acceptor in the enolization of a ring-opened substrate.\r"

We report the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the beta subunit of murine muscle-specific enolase. The corresponding amino acid sequence shows greater than 80% homology with the beta subunit from chicken obtained by protein sequencing and with alpha and gamma subunits from rat and mouse deduced from cloned cDNAs. In contrast, there is no homology between the 3' untranslated regions of mouse alpha, beta, and gamma enolase mRNAs, which also differ greatly in length. The short 3' untranslated region of beta enolase mRNA accounts for its distinct length, 1600 bases. It is known that a progressive transition from alpha alpha to beta beta enolase occurs in developing skeletal muscle. We show that this transition mainly results from a differential regulation of alpha and beta mRNA levels. Analysis of myogenic cell lines shows that beta enolase gene is expressed at the myoblast stage. Moreover, transfection of premyogenic C3H10T1/2 cells with MyoD1 cDNA shows that the initial expression of beta transcripts occurs during the very first steps of the myogenic pathway, suggesting that it could be a marker event of myogenic lineage determination.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated a 725-base-pair cDNA clone for human eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). EDN is a distinct cationic protein of the eosinophil's large specific granule known primarily for its ability to induce ataxia, paralysis, and central nervous system cellular degeneration in experimental animals (Gordon phenomenon). The open reading frame encodes a 134-amino acid mature polypeptide with a molecular mass of 15.5 kDa and a 27-residue amino-terminal hydrophobic leader sequence. The sequence of the mature polypeptide is identical to that reported for human urinary ribonuclease [Beintema, J. J., Hofsteenge, J., Iwama, M., Morita, T., Ohgi, K., Irie, M., Sugiyama, R. H., Schieven, G. L., Dekker, C. A. & Glitz, D. G. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 4530-4538] and to the amino-terminal sequence of human liver ribonuclease [Sorrentino, S., Tucker, G. K. & Glitz, D. G. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16125-16131]; the cDNA encodes a tryptophan in position 7, which was previously unidentified in the amino acid sequences of EDN or the urinary and liver ribonucleases. Both EDN and the related granule protein, eosinophil cationic protein, have ribonucleolytic activity; sequence similarities among EDN, eosinophil cationic protein, ribonucleases from liver, urine, and pancreas, and angiogenin define a ribonuclease multigene family. mRNA encoding EDN was detected in uninduced HL-60 cells and was up-regulated in cells induced toward eosinophilic differentiation with B-cell growth factor 2/interleukin 5 and toward neutrophilic differentiation with dimethyl sulfoxide. EDN mRNA was detected in mature neutrophils even though EDN-like neurotoxic activity is not found in neutrophil extracts. These results suggest that neutrophils contain a protein that is closely related or identical to EDN.\r"

We recently purified the major (pI 4.9) synthase from human myocardium. The N-terminal sequence (A P Y T V V Y F P V R G R X K A L R M L X A D) is greater than 73% identical with that of a neutral (pI 6.7) detoxification enzyme, glutathione transferase P from rat hepatocellular carcinoma (P P Y T I V Y F P V R G R C E A T R M L L A D). Moreover, both the major human fatty acid ethyl ester synthase and bovine liver glutathione transferase catalyze the formation of fatty acid ethyl esters (Vmax 105 and 98 nmol per hr per mg, respectively). In addition, both enzymes catalyze the formation of glutathione-xenobiotic conjugates (Vmax 67 and 335 mol per hr per mol of enzyme, respectively). Physiological concentrations of glutathione increase the rate of formation of fatty acid ethyl esters up to 5-fold, and the glutathione transferase substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is a potent inhibitor of human myocardial fatty acid ethyl ester synthase. Thus, the identification of the major form of human myocardial fatty acid ethyl ester synthase as an acidic glutathione transferase links alcohol and xenobiotic metabolism and may relate the enhancement of tumorigenesis by alcohol abuse with carcinogen-conjugation reactions.\r"

The collision rate was estimated for tempocholine phosphatidic acid ester, 5-doxylstearic acid, and 16-doxylstearic acid from spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) measured in the presence and absence of molecular oxygen. Profiles of the local oxygen transport parameter across the membrane were obtained as a function of cholesterol mol fraction and temperature in L-alpha-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine ([ Myr2]PtdCho) and L-alpha-dioleoylphosphatidylcholine ([ Ole2]PtdCho) membranes. Membrane oxygen permeability coefficients were estimated from oxygen transport parameter profiles. At approximately 30 degrees C, the oxygen permeability coefficients in the presence and absence of 50 mol % cholesterol are 22.7 and 125.2 cm/s, respectively, for [Myr2]PtdCho membranes, and 54.7 and 114.2 cm/s, respectively, for [Ole2]PtdCho membranes (compared with 60-80 cm/s for water layers with the same thicknesses as the membranes). The major results in the liquid-crystalline phase are as follows: (i) In the absence of cholesterol, membranes are not barriers to oxygen transport. (ii) Addition of 50 mol % cholesterol decreases oxygen permeability by a factor of approximately 5 and approximately 2.5 in [Myr2]PtdCho and [Ole2]PtdCho membranes, respectively. The resistance to oxygen transport is located in and near the polar headgroup regions in the membrane. (iii) Cholesterol increases oxygen transport in the central regions of [Ole2]PtdCho membranes.\r"

We have used the adduct as a model for pyruvate in a competent ternary complex by comparing the Raman spectrum of the bound adduct with that for unliganded pyruvate. To understand the observed normal modes of pyruvate both as the bound adduct and in water, we have taken the Raman spectra of a series of 13C- and 18O-labeled pyruvates. We find that the carboxylate COO- moiety of pyruvate remains unprotonated at LDH's active site and forms an ion pair complex. The frequency of pyruvate's carbonyl C = O moiety shifts from 1710 cm-1 in water downward 34 cm-1 when pyruvate binds to LDH. This frequency shift corresponds to a ca. 34% polarization of the carbonyl bond, indicates a substantial interaction between the C = O group and enzyme, and is direct evidence for and is a measure of enzyme-induced electronic perturbation of the substrate needed for catalysis. This bond polarization is likely brought about by electrostatic interactions between the carbonyl moiety and the protonated imidazole group of His-195 and the guanidino group from Arg-109. We discuss how the data bear on the enzymatic chemistry of LDH.\r"

We have developed 13C NMR methods to measure directly the rate of human muscle glycogen formation from infused, isotopically labeled [1-13C]glucose. We show that under conditions of imposed hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, a majority of the infused glucose was converted to muscle glycogen in a normal man. This directly shows that muscle is the major site of glucose disposal under these conditions, and provides quantitation of the glucose flux to muscle glycogen.\r"

Since an alkaline cytoplasm has been shown to be required for growth, we measured cytoplasmic pH in individual cells as a function of spreading. The degree of spreading was controlled by coating tissue culture plastic with varying amounts of the nonadhesive polymer polyHEMA. Completely round BALB/c 3T3 cells were 0.15 pH unit more acidic than spread cells. In short-term experiments, cells were treated with the peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro to induce rounding or by plating on fibronectin to induce spreading. When cells were induced to change shape, pH changed rapidly and reversibly. All of the anchorage-dependent cell lines tested behaved similarly, but 3T3 cells transformed by the plasma membrane oncogene src or ras were able to maintain a relatively alkaline pH even when completely round. Cells transformed by the nuclear oncogene myc behaved like normal cells. Our results suggest that the requirement for spreading may in part be mediated by cytoplasmic pH. Anchorage-independent growth due to oncogenes that localize to the plasma membrane is associated with loss of this control mechanism.\r"

The mobilization of intracellular calcium was verified by imaging of fura-2 fluorescence in individual cells and by monitoring the efflux of 45Ca2+ from preloaded cells. However, we found no activation of protein kinase C as measured by phosphorylation of an 80-kDa acidic protein and by transmodulation of the receptor for epidermal growth factor. A careful examination of the kinetics of the phosphorylation reaction (from 30 sec to 10 min) revealed no activation of protein kinase C by extracellular ATP at any time. The lack of activation of protein kinase C was demonstrated even when a concentration of ATP 10-fold higher than that required to give a strong Ca2+ signal was used. Extracellular ATP did not inhibit protein kinase C activation by fetal bovine serum, platelet-derived growth factor, or phorbol esters. The effects of ATP were also produced by UTP but not by ADP, AMP, or adenosine. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to induce the mobilization of intracellular calcium by an inositol phosphate-mediated pathway without the activation of protein kinase C.\r"

We have undertaken studies to determine the mechanism of this inhibition. Using conditioned media and affinity-purified antibodies to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), we now demonstrate that activated TGF-beta produced in these cocultures mediates EC growth inhibition. No inhibitory activity was detected when media conditioned by individual cultures of EC, SMC, or pericytes were examined for their effect on EC growth. In contrast, media conditioned by cocultures of EC-SMC and EC-pericytes inhibited EC proliferation to the same degree as the coculture itself. Immunoadsorption of coculture-derived conditioned media with antibodies to TGF-beta eliminated the inhibitory activity. Acid activation of serum-free media conditioned by any of the cells cultured alone yielded inhibitory activity, whereas activation of coculture conditioned media did not increase its inhibitory activity. Addition of anti-TGF-beta neutralizing antibodies to cocultures blocked the pericyte-mediated EC growth inhibition. These results indicate that latent TGF-beta is produced by these cells and it is activated by a mechanism that requires contact between the two cell types.\r"

Using a hemizygous, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT)-deficient, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant as a transfection recipient, we have demonstrated correction of a nonrevertible deletion mutation by targeted homologous recombination. Transfection with a plasmid carrying a fragment of the APRT gene yielded APRT+ recombinants at a frequency of approximately 4.1 x 10(-7). The ratio of targeted recombination to nontargeted integrations of plasmid sequences was approximately 1:4000. Analysis of 31 independent APRT+ recombinants revealed conversions of the endogenous APRT gene, targeted integration at the APRT locus, and a third class of events in which the plasmid donor APRT fragment was converted to a full-length, functional gene.\r"

  ".U": "89282815\r", 
  ".W": "To date, two classes of mouse major urinary protein (MUP)-encoding genes have been described, the expressed genes and the intervening-sequence-containing pseudogenes. The data presented in this paper define a third class, the silent Mup genes, which are potentially functional but appear not to be expressed under normal circumstances. We describe a MUP subfamily (Mup-1.5) containing two genes, Mup-1.5a and Mup-1.5b, that are nearly identical, differing at only three positions (greater than 99.9% identity) over the entire 4-kilobase (kb) transcription unit and approximately 1 kb of flanking DNA. The similarity between these two genes extends over greater than 35 kb. Using specific oligonucleotides, we have shown that the 5a gene is expressed in BALB/cByJ mice, primarily in the submaxillary gland, whereas the 5b gene is not expressed. However, we found that when a 9.4-kb DNA fragment containing the Mup-1.5b gene was introduced into the mouse germ line, mice in two of the four transgenic lines expressed this gene at a high level and with the tissue-specificity characteristic of the Mup-1.5a gene. These results suggest that the inactivity of the endogenous Mup-1.5b gene is due not to a lack of functional positive regulatory elements, but to long-range, inhibitory position effects.\r"

The plant amino acid sequence is highly conserved with respect to corresponding microbial sequences. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence is characteristic of chloroplast transit peptides.

We have examined loci on chromosome 1p for loss-of-constitutional heterozygosity in 35 melanomas and 21 melanoma cell lines to analyze the role of these abnormalities in melanocyte transformation. Loss-of-heterozygosity at loci on chromosome 1p was identified in 15/35 (43%) melanomas and 11/21 (52%) melanoma cell lines. Analysis of multiple metastases derived from the same patient and of melanoma and lymphoblastoid samples from a family with hereditary melanoma showed that the loss-of-heterozygosity at loci on distal 1p is a late event in tumor progression, rather than the second mutation that would occur if melanoma were due to a cellular recessive mechanism. Comparisons with neuroblastoma and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2) suggest that the frequent 1p loss-of-heterozygosity in these malignancies is a common late event of neuroectodermal tumor progression.\r"

Here we present a comparison of the genomic structures of GPA and GPB developed by analyzing DNA clones isolated from a K562 genomic library. Nucleotide sequences of exon-intron junctions and 5' and 3' flanking sequences revealed that the GPA and GPB genes consist of 7 and 5 exons, respectively, and both genes have greater than 95% identical sequence from the 5' flanking region to the region approximately 1 kilobase downstream from the exon encoding the transmembrane regions. In this homologous part of the genes, GPB lacks one exon due to a point mutation at the 5' splicing site of the third intron, which inactivates the 5' cleavage event of splicing and leads to ligation of the second to the fourth exon. Following these very homologous sequences, the genomic sequences for GPA and GPB diverge significantly and no homology can be detected in their 3' end sequences. The transition site from homologous to nonhomologous sequences can be localized within Alu repeat sequences. The analysis of the Alu sequences and their flanking direct repeat sequences suggest that an ancestral genomic structure has been maintained in the GPA gene, whereas the GPB gene has arisen from the acquisition of 3' sequences different from those of the GPA gene by homologous recombination at the Alu repeats during or after gene duplication.\r"

  ".U": "89282836\r", 
  ".W": "A stable isotope procedure to estimate hepatic glucose carbon recycling and thereby elucidate the mechanism by which glucose is produced in patients lacking glucose 6-phosphatase is described. A total of 10 studies was performed in children with glycogen storage disease type I (GSD-I) and type III (GSD-III) and control subjects. A primed dose-constant nasogastric infusion of D-[U-13C]glucose (greater than 99% 13C-enriched) or an infusion diluted with nonlabeled glucose solution was administered following different periods of fasting. Hepatic glucose carbon recycling was estimated from 13C NMR spectra. The recycling parameters were derived from plasma beta-glucose C-1 splitting pattern, doublet/singlet values of plasma glucose C-1 in comparison to doublet/singlet values of known mixtures of [U-13C]glucose and unlabeled glucose as a function of 13C enrichment of glucose C-1. The fractional glucose C-1 enrichment of plasma glucose samples was analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. The values obtained for GSD-I patients coincided with the standard [U-13C]glucose dilution curve. These results indicate that the plasma glucose of GSD-I subjects comprises only a mixture of 99% 13C-enriched D-[U-13C]glucose and unlabeled glucose but lacks any recycled glucose. Significantly different glucose carbon recycling values were obtained for two GSD-III patients in comparison to GSD-I patients. Our results eliminate a mechanism for glucose production in GSD-I children involving gluconeogenesis. However, glucose release by amylo-1,6-glucosidase activity would result in endogenous glucose production of non-13C-labeled and nonrecycled glucose carbon, as was found in this study. In GSD-III patients gluconeogenesis is suggested as the major route for endogenous glucose synthesis. The contribution of the triose-phosphate pathway in these patients has been determined. The significant difference of the glucose C-1 splitting pattern in plasma GSD-III and control subjects, in comparison to GSD-I plasma, can be used as a parameter for estimating glucose recycling. This approach can be developed as a noninvasive diagnostic test for inborn enzymatic defects involving gluconeogenesis.\r"

Open-chest dogs undergoing a 15-min coronary occlusion received an i.v. infusion of the spin trap, alpha-phenyl N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) (50 mg/kg). In group I (n = 6), EPR signals characteristic of radical adducts of PBN appeared in the coronary venous blood during ischemia and increased dramatically after reperfusion. In group II (n = 6), which received PBN and i.v. superoxide dismutase (SOD; 16,000 units/kg) plus catalase (12,000 units/kg), myocardial production of PBN adducts was undetectable during ischemia (delta = -100%, P less than 0.01 vs. group I) and markedly inhibited after reperfusion (delta = -86%, P less than 0.001). This effect was seen at all levels of ischemic zone flow but was relatively greater in the low-flow range. In group III (n = 8), the same dosages of SOD and catalase without PBN markedly enhanced contractile recovery (measured as systolic wall thickening) after reperfusion [P less than 0.01 at 3 hr vs. controls (group IV, n = 7)]. Systemic plasma activity of SOD and catalase averaged 127 +/- 24 and 123 +/- 82 units/ml, respectively, 2 min after reperfusion. PBN produced no apparent adverse effects and actually improved postischemic contractile recovery in group I (P less than 0.05 at 3 hr vs. controls). This study shows that (i) SOD and catalase are highly effective in blocking free radical reactions in vivo, (ii) the radicals generated in the \"stunned\" myocardium are derived from univalent reduction of O2, and (iii) inhibition of radical reactions improves functional recovery. The results provide direct, in vivo evidence to support the hypothesis that reactive oxygen metabolites play a causal role in the myocardial \"stunning\" seen after brief ischemia.\r"

Hybridization signals (10- to 200-fold intensified) and modified restriction patterns were observed with both cDNA probes in 4 of the 16 leukemia DNA preparations examined. These reflected the amplification of the corresponding AcChoEase and BtChoEase genes (ACHE and CHE) and alteration in their structure. Parallel analysis of 30 control samples revealed nonpolymorphic, much weaker hybridization signals for each of the probes. In view of previous reports on the effect of acetylcholine analogs and ChoEase inhibitors in the induction of megakaryocytopoiesis and production of platelets in the mouse, we further searched for such phenomena in nonleukemic patients with platelet production disorders. Amplifications of both ACHE and CHE genes were found in 2 of the 4 patients so far examined. Pronounced coamplification of these two related but distinct genes in correlation with pathological production of blood cells suggests a functional role for members of the ChoEase family in megakaryocytopoiesis and raises the question whether the coamplification of these genes could be causally involved in the etiology of hemocytopoietic disorders.\r"

In phospholipids, linoleic acid (18:2 omega 6; 18 carbon atoms, 2 double bonds, 6 carbon atoms beyond last double bond) was normal and 18:3 omega 6 was increased, but all subsequent omega 6 acids were subnormal (P less than 0.001), indicating impairment of chain elongation. All omega 3 acids were subnormal. The paucity of polyunsaturated fatty acids was compensated mass-wise by an increase in saturated acids. Disproportionate increases in short-chain, saturated, and monounsaturated acids, decreases in long-chain homologs, and increases of branched and odd-chain acids were observed. Loss of polyunsaturated fatty acids and replacement by nonessential acids lowered mean chain length and raised mean melting point significantly, suggesting that lowered membrane fluidity was only partially compensated by endogenous synthesis of lower-melting, nonessential acids. This phenomenon was not observed in cholesteryl esters or triacylglycerols. Nonesterified fatty acids showed significant changes in pattern of possible autacoid precursors. The abnormal profile of fatty acids in multiple sclerosis has features in common with profiles of other syndromes involving viral infections.\r"

The details of these axonal arbors as well as their relation to the neurons of the reticular nucleus were investigated by using Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin injections into the basal nucleus and intracellular injections of Lucifer yellow into reticular nucleus neurons. Axons arising in the caudal basal nucleus at the medial margin of the globus pallidus do not enter the dorsal thalamus but are confined to the reticular nucleus, where they arborize widely and densely. Neurons in the reticular nucleus are large, with sparsely spined and beaded dendrites, which radiate within the plane of the nucleus. Bouton-like swellings along basal nucleus axons are often found apposed to the somata of reticular nucleus neurons, although many are also apposed to dendrites. These morphological observations suggest a second potentially significant route, in addition to its well-known direct cortical projection, through which the magnocellular basal nucleus could influence cortical function: it may, by strategically modulating the excitability of reticular nucleus neurons, alter the general state of the thalamus and hence affect the initial transmission of information to the cortex.\r"

However, IgG molecules are excluded from entering brain, owing to a lack of transport of these plasma proteins through the brain capillary wall, or blood-brain barrier (BBB). The possibility of enhanced IgG delivery through the BBB by cationization of the proteins was explored in the present studies. Native bovine IgG molecules were cationized by covalent coupling of hexamethylenediamine and the isoelectric point was raised to greater than 10.7 based on isoelectric focusing studies. Native and cationized IgG molecules were radiolabeled with 125I and chloramine T. Cationized IgG, but not native IgG, was rapidly taken up by isolated bovine brain microvessels, which were used as an in vitro model system of the BBB. Cationized IgG binding was time and temperature dependent and was saturated by increasing concentrations of unlabeled cationized IgG (dissociation constant of the high-affinity binding site, 0.90 +/- 0.37 microM; Bmax, 1.4 +/- 0.4 nmol per mg of protein). In vivo studies documented enhanced brain uptake of 125I-labeled cationized IgG relative to [3H]albumin, and complete transcytosis of the 125I-labeled cationized IgG molecule through the BBB and into brain parenchyma was demonstrated by thaw-mount autoradiography of frozen sections of rat brain obtained after carotid arterial infusions of 125I-labeled cationized IgG. These studies demonstrate that cationization of IgG molecules greatly facilitates the transport of these plasma proteins through the BBB in vivo, and this process may provide a new strategy for IgG delivery through the BBB.\r"

A combined axonal transport/double-immunohistochemical method was used to show that at least one-quarter of the cholecystokinin-immunoreactive cells in the MeAp cocontain substance P and that a substantial proportion of these cells project to the medial preoptic nucleus. In situ hybridization histochemistry was then used to demonstrate that estrogen regulates the expression of preprocholecystokinin in these cells at the mRNA level in male and female rats. In contrast, levels of preprotachykinin mRNA within the MeAp do not appear to be sensitive to acute changes in circulating gonadal steroids in either sex. Although posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA stability may contribute to the observed effects, it appears likely that estrogen stimulates preprocholecystokinin expression within the MeAp by selectively inducing transcription of the corresponding gene, thereby altering the relative amounts of cholecystokinin and substance P coexpressed within individual neurons of the MeAp that project to the hypothalamus.\r"

  ".W": "The study presented here indicates that norepinephrine (NE) selectively induces long-lasting modifications of synaptically mediated responses in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampal slice. A low concentration of NE (1.0 microM; in the presence of 50 microM phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist) or a 1.0 microM concentration of the specific beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced long-lasting pathway-specific alterations of granule cell electrophysiological responses. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials and population spikes evoked by stimulation of the medial perforant pathway (PP) were potentiated for more than 45 min. In contrast, responses to lateral PP stimulation were depressed for the same period. Both potentiation and depression were blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (1.0 microM). These results indicate that NE can act differentially on projections to the dentate gyrus arising in the entorhinal cortex. Such selective persistent modifications of cortical circuits may be involved in processes in the mammalian brain underlying attention, learning, and memory.\r"

In this study, we demonstrate that the activation of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor, transfected into a thyroid epithelial cell, elicits a program of growth and differentiation normally observed with TSH. In thyroid cells expressing beta 2 receptors, the beta 2 agonist isoproterenol activates adenylate cyclase, induces the expression of a thyroid-specific iodide carrier system, and can substitute for TSH to promote growth. Thus, in thyroid cells expressing beta 2-adrenergic receptors, isoproterenol elicits the entire array of thyroid-specific functions normally activated by TSH.\r"

Pattern analysis of the 11 chromosomal polymorphisms in the context of the recently discovered morphological and behavioral divergence within the species has elucidated the history of the chromosomal differentiation. We identify four chronological groups of inversions and their probable sites of origin. Spread of the derived \"3-row\" bristle morphotype on the Hilo side of the Island of Hawaii has been accompanied by the acquisition of six new inversion polymorphisms. Three phylogenetically old inversions show correlations with altitude, and there are multiple cross-correlations between inversions on the same and different chromosomes, reflecting complex interaction systems. Quantification of the genetic population structure of D. silvestris by hierarchical F statistics reveals a dramatic level of genetic differentiation for an evolutionarily new species of such restricted range. This level exceeds that of older, continental Drosophila species. There is, however, minimal concordance between the chromosomal variation and the morphological-behavioral discontinuity, a consequence of the extensive cytological variation within each morphotype. Such a fragmented gene pool favors the rapid evolution and continued divergence of this insular species.\r"

  ".W": "A blow-in fracture is an inwardly displaced fracture of the orbital rim or wall resulting in decreased orbital volume. The purpose of this study is to classify orbital blow-in fractures, describe the distinguishing clinical and radiologic features, and review the result of treatment. The series consists of 41 patients with blow-in fractures (34 males and 7 females). The mean age of the patients was 36 years. All were treated between 1979 and December of 1986 at Sunnybrook Medical Centre in Toronto. Clinical features of blow-in fractures were primarily related to the decrease in volume of the orbital cavity. Proptosis was a consistent finding, and in 27 percent of patients, the globe was further displaced in a coronal plane. Restricted ocular motility and diplopia were documented in 24 and 32 percent of patients, respectively. Fracture fragments displaced into the orbit resulted in globe rupture in 12 percent of patients, superior orbital fissure syndrome in 10 percent, and optic nerve injury in 1 patient. Blow-in orbital injuries were classified as pure fractures, consisting of an isolated blow-in of a segment of the roof, floor, or walls, or impure fractures, where the orbital rim itself was disrupted. In all cases, early decompression of the orbit and open reduction of fractures was necessary. Late sequelae of blow-in fractures were primarily related to injuries of intraorbital contents. Twelve percent of patients underwent enucleation and 8 percent reported persistent diplopia. Despite the presence of superior orbital fissure syndrome and complete ophthalmoplegia in 10 percent of patients, early orbital decompression resulted in resolution of nerve palsies in all but one patient.\r"

All cases were successful clinically. Anatomically, the parascapular flap is supplied by the cutaneous parascapular artery, a branch of the circumflex scapular artery, which itself derives from the subscapular artery. Flap territory may reach 15 x 30 cm, and the vascular pedicle can extend 14 cm if the subscapular artery is taken. Advantages of this flap include the constancy, length, and caliber of the vascular pedicle; the length and width attributes, which allow both coverage of large wounds and primary closure of the donor defect; and an absence of disruption of musculoskeletal function.\r"

This type of microcomputer, of course, is not limited to just the imaging system, but can be used for a variety of other programs as well, such as word processing, slide labeling and production, spreadsheet functions, billing and filing, and numerous business and other applications. The ease of use with readily available 35-mm slides of my patients has greatly enhanced the appeal of this system. Computerized imaging, when used as an educational tool, can be very helpful in preoperative planning, resident teaching, and for illustration and discussion of a patient's proposed surgery. The electronic imaging disclaimer compiled by the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons has been extremely helpful in clarifying the limits of computerized imaging and reducing any false expectations that my patients might have.

Interosseous wires, Kirschner wires, and more recently, rigid metallic miniplates have been recommended for fixation of these and other midfacial fractures. However, the precise physical stability of the zygoma with respect to wire versus miniplate fixation methods and with respect to the number and location of miniplates applied is not known. Noncomminuted zygoma fractures were simulated by saw osteotomy in eight fresh human cadaver heads (16 zygoma \"fractures\"). Each zygoma was sequentially fixated with three miniplates, two miniplates, one miniplate, and three interosseous wires across the orbital rim and arch \"fractures\". Static and oscillating loads simulating maximal physiologic masticatory stresses were applied to the fixated zygoma along the lines of action of the masseter muscle by means of a tensometer. The stability and adequacy of each pattern of fixation were recorded. Double-miniplate fixation across the orbital rim of simulated noncomminuted zygoma \"fractures\" is sufficient to withstand static and oscillating loading similar to physiologic masticatory forces. Neither single-miniplate fixation nor triple-wire fixation are sufficient to stabilize the zygoma against similar forces.\r"

For larger defects, the technique was further modified using composite chondrocutaneous flaps. The technique uses the principle of separation of the ear elements and redistribution for closure of defects in the nonmarginal areas of the ear with minimal sacrifice of the tissue, ear size, and ear shape. This technique is reliable, relatively simple, and a one-stage operation, as demonstrated in our series of seven patients.\r"

Twenty-three of 25 patients with nasal packing and 22 of 25 patients without nasal packing were available for follow-up. This study suggests that patients with nasal packing are less likely to develop recurrent septal deviation and synechia and more likely to have improvement in the nasal airway. Only one of the patients with nasal packing found the removal of the packing the most uncomfortable part of the surgery. The most impressive and statistically significant finding, however, was the significant difference between the two groups in terms of airway improvement, which was 96 percent in the nasal packing group and 64 percent in the group without nasal packing. There was also a higher incidence of recurrent or residual septal deviation in the group without nasal packing (41 percent), while the group with nasal packing had only (13 percent) recurrent or residual deviation.\r"

In one patient, a further reconstructive procedure using free vascularized tissue was carried out. A third patient with involvement of the maxilla, again presenting with bleeding, was treated with embolization and, because of the deformity that would be created by resection, was simply observed. However, this patient is to be reassessed in the future and may well come to maxillectomy. It is emphasized that the treatment of these patients requires careful assessment, embolization, and resection as indicated after discussion between radiologist and surgeon.\r"

Unfamiliarity with the clinical manifestations of cutaneous angiosarcoma frequently leads to misdiagnosis and delay in treatment. Complete surgical resection requires the performance of preoperative staging biopsies to determine the true extent of the neoplasm. Intraoperative frozen section analysis to determine the adequacy of the surgical resection is unreliable due to the high false-negative rate. All patients should receive a full course of postoperative radiation.\r"

  ".W": "Capillary hemangioma of infancy (strawberry mark) is a self-limiting problem, and conservative treatment is recommended. These birthmarks can be associated with a great deal of morbidity. There is definitely a role for a palliative form of treatment without systemic complications or destruction of adjacent tissue. In a 6-year period, 55 patients received 57 Nd:YAG or argon laser treatments. Thirty patients received 31 argon treatments, and 25 patients received 26 Nd:YAG treatments; and 2 received first argon with subsequent Nd:YAG treatments. Although more dramatic successes were noted in the Nd:YAG laser, complications were more frequent and severe. Complications included delayed healing, postoperative bleeding, and some hypertrophic scarring. Complications were seen in 12 percent of all patients, 9 percent of these associated with the Nd:YAG laser.\r"

  ".W": "The fibula was investigated as a donor site for free-flap mandible reconstruction. It has the advantages of consistent shape, ample length, distant location to allow a two-team approach, and low donor-site morbidity. It can be raised with a skin island for composite-tissue reconstruction. Twelve segmental mandibular defects (average 13.5 cm) were reconstructed following resection for tumor, most commonly epidermoid carcinoma. Five defects consisted of bone alone, and four others had only a small amount of associated intraoral soft-tissue loss. Eleven patients underwent primary reconstructions. At least two osteotomies were performed on each graft, and miniplates were used for fixation in 11 patients. Six patients received postoperative radiation, and two patients received postoperative chemotherapy. The flaps survived in all patients. All osteotomies healed primarily. The septocutaneous blood supply was generally not adequate to support a skin island for intraoral soft-tissue replacement. The aesthetic result of the reconstruction was excellent in most patients, particularly in \"bone only\" defects. There was no long-term donor-site morbidity.\r"

An idiopathic presentation is possible. In contrast to primary osteomyelitis of the clavicle, which is occasionally seen in children, secondary osteomyelitis is quite rare. It is often mistaken for a fracture or a possible neoplasm on plain x-rays. Tomograms and CT scanning are confirmatory, and in early cases, technetium-99m bone scanning can be helpful. Treatment must include early, aggressive surgical debridement of all affected tissues, followed by wound coverage with a well-vascularized flap and perioperative antibiotics.\r"

It is based on rolling a deepithelialized flap around from the rear and sliding it underneath the inside frontal skin of the arm, recreating the roundness of the arm and a firmer consistency. This technique has been utilized in 12 patients so far, with a follow-up ranging from 8 months to 4 years. No postoperative edema were observed, but one case of hyperesthesia appeared for a period of 2 months. The main preoccupation is scar sequelae, which must limit the intervention to patients clearly aware of the possibility of healing complications.\r"

  ".W": "From 1977 to 1987, 87 consecutive patients underwent intrathoracic muscle transposition. Indications for the operation were bronchopleural fistula, postpneumonectomy empyema, perforation of the heart or great vessels, esophageal fistula, tracheal fistula, empyema, and prophylactic reinforcements of the airway. Of the 118 muscles transposed, the serratus anterior was used in 48 patients, the latissimus dorsi in 33, the pectoralis major in 26, and other muscles in 11. Depending on the wound status at the time of muscle transposition, the chest either was left open for dressing changes or was closed primarily. The number of operations per patient ranged from 1 to 16 (median 2). There were 13 operative deaths (14.9 percent). The follow-up period ranged from 3.9 to 130.9 months (median 28.3 months). Overall results were excellent in 65 patients (74.7 percent). There was no difference in results when considered according to treatment indication. We conclude that when there is an actual or potential leak of the tracheobronchial tree, heart and great vessels, or intrathoracic gastrointestinal tract, intrathoracic muscle transposition can be a lifesaving adjunct.\r"
