  ".W": "Imaging studies are performed on patients with arthritis for a variety of reasons: to determine whether an arthritic condition is present; to establish the specific diagnosis; to determine the extent of disease; to assess the activity of disease; to detect complications of disease; to evaluate progression of disease; to judge the efficacy of drug treatment; to help in selection of surgical candidates; to aid in the choice of surgical procedures; to size, design, or fabricate prostheses; and to identify complications of surgery. Conventional radiography is still the mainstay of all examinations in arthritic patients. Arthrography is best applied to evaluate complications of disease and of surgery, although it may be useful in disease detection and in determining the specific diagnosis. Nuclear medicine studies are best used to identify complications of surgery and may also be useful to assess disease activity or extent. Ultrasound is useful to detect dissecting synovial cysts and deep venous thrombosis. The most valuable role of computed tomography is in the design and fabrication of prostheses and in evaluating complex anatomy of involved joints. Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in early detection of articular cartilage damage and may assist in determination of the specific diagnosis; enhancement with contrast material may aid in assessment of disease activity.\r"

The various steps taken during the development of the QA program reflect the response of the QA committee as it came to a better understanding of the components of QA. Accrediting and regulatory bodies have had important roles in providing guidance. Quality control of instrumentation and radiopharmaceuticals opened the gateway to monitoring in high-volume, high-risk areas; however, QA expanded this concept into better generic and clinical monitoring. Encouragement of the use of quality of care referral forms resulted in greater participation by all members of the department. Examples of physicians' QA activities include double reading of images and sending of code cards. Experience with other forms of physician QA activities is also included. The QA committee provides a forum for five steps of QA: identify problems, assess the causes, implement action to prevent them, monitor effects of the actions, and document these activities. These steps should lead to improvement in the standards of patient care.\r"

  ".W": "Gadopentetate dimeglumine was administered prospectively to 50 patients who presented for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging within 2 weeks after a cortical cerebral infarction. Twenty-two patients (44%) were imaged within 3 days after clinical ictus. Abnormalities detected with gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement were observed in 46 (92%) of 50 patients. Classic parenchymal enhancement was a late finding, observed in all patients (17 of 17) imaged at 7-14 days after infarction. Before this time, three additional phases of contrast material-related abnormalities were observed. Enhancement of vessels supplying the infarct (\"intravascular enhancement sign\") was the earliest finding, seen in 17 (77%) of 22 infarcts aged 1-3 days. From day 2 to day 6, abnormal enhancement of meninges adjacent to the infarct was frequently noted (\"meningeal enhancement sign\"). Finally, a transition phase that combined intravascular or meningeal enhancement with early parenchymal enhancement was seen from day 3 to day 6. Gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging in early stroke reveals evidence of vascular engorgement and sluggish flow, which precede the development of classic parenchymal enhancement.\r"

MR signal intensities from lactate, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline, and creatine from a volume of interest containing the tumor and a contralateral volume were obtained and evaluated. NAA signal intensities were generally decreased in the tumor spectra, and choline signal intensities were elevated. H-1 MR spectroscopy was unsuccessful in eight patients, and FDG PET scans were not obtained in four of the patients with successful MR spectroscopic examinations. Lactate signal intensity was detected in 10 of the 28 patients who had successful H-1 MR spectroscopic and FDG PET studies. Lactate signal intensities were observed in lesions shown at FDG PET to be hypermetabolic, as well as in lesions found to be hypometabolic.\r"

The P-31 MR spectroscopic data were acquired by means of three-dimensional chemical shift imaging (phase encoding in three spatial dimensions) on a 1.5-T clinical instrument equipped with a specially designed quadrature P-31 birdcage coil constructed in the authors' laboratory. Axial, sagittal, and coronal metabolite images based on the area for any one of five peak regions (phosphodiester; phosphocreatine; gamma, alpha, and beta adenosine triphosphate) were generated from 8 X 8 X 8 or 12 X 12 X 8 CSI arrays with voxel sizes of 27 cm3 and 12 cm3, respectively. The positions of these images were aligned with anatomic features by means of the voxel-shifting capability of the Fourier transform. Direct overlays of these metabolite images on corresponding proton images demonstrated excellent correlation with anatomy, factors indicating the utility of this technique for viewing P-31 metabolite levels in all areas of the brain simultaneously.\r"

Revascularization occurred frequently, necessitating multiple endovascular sessions. Long-term clinical evaluation showed clinical improvement, compared with the initial status before treatment, in 63% of the patients. Clinical aggravation due to embolization was observed in seven patients (20%) after 12 of the 158 endovascular sessions (8%). These results are better than those reported after surgery and indicate that embolization with particles is an efficient and safe tool in the treatment of thoracic intramedullary AVMs.\r"

The phase information in the resultant image was converted to flow velocity with a calibration curve with the slope 26.5 radian.m-1.sec. The velocity versus time function was Fourier transformed and a continuous curve was fitted to the measured data with use of the first three harmonics. The in vivo measurements showed a significant variation in flow velocities in the cerebral aqueduct (range, 6-51 mm/sec). Calculated CSF production was in the range of 0.6-1.2 L/24 h. The present method gives valuable information about CSF hydrodynamics in an imaging time of less than 8 minutes.\r"

Seventeen patients with inflammatory changes and 43 with benign and malignant tumors were studied. The examinations were carried out with plain T1-weighted sequences with a repetition time (TR) of 500 msec and an echo time (TE) of 25 msec (TR/TE = 500/25), T2-weighted sequences (1,600/90), and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted sequences in axial, coronal, and sagittal orientations. For identifying normal anatomic structures such as the facial nerve and the main duct, the administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine was helpful. In inflammatory changes, gadolinium-enhanced images showed no diagnostic advantages. Gadopentetate dimeglumine proved helpful in delineating tumorous lesions and in differentiating benign and malignant lesions. However, an exact differentiation of the different histologic types was not possible. Post-operative fibrosis could be differentiated from recurrent tumors after administration of gadolinium. If a question regarding infiltration or definition of the boundaries of a lesion cannot be answered with non-enhanced MR imaging, gadopentetate dimeglumine administration is advised. However, for routine imaging of the parotid gland, its use is not recommended.\r"

Mean extraocular muscle diameters and the calculated muscle diameter index were significantly increased in all orbits with ophthalmopathy, particularly in those with optic neuropathy. Graves orbitopathy affected the superior muscle group (63.4%) more than the medial (61.3%) or inferior (57%) recti. The most common pattern of muscle involvement involved all five measured extraocular muscles. Solitary muscle involvement most frequently involved the superior muscle group (6.3%). Significant enlargements of the retrobulbar optic nerve sheath and superior ophthalmic vein were noted only in orbits with optic neuropathy. Anterior displacement of the lacrimal gland at CT correlated with clinical palpability and occurred more frequently in patients with optic neuropathy. Severe apical crowding was the most sensitive indication of optic neuropathy at CT.\r"

Seven patients received gadopentetate dimeglumine injections. The most common MR appearance was that of a homogeneous mass, hyperintense to both muscle and fat on long TR/long TE images and isointense or minimally hyperintense to muscle on short TR/short TE images. All lesions of the patients who received gadopentetate dimeglumine enhanced markedly. Two lesions had intratumoral hemorrhage, and six were markedly heterogeneous in signal intensity. Similar MR signal intensity patterns have been described for lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinomas. The forte of MR imaging lies in its ability to delineate precisely the extent of the rhabdomyosarcoma.\r"

In the three patients whose epiphora did not improve, no worsening of symptoms occurred. These results are preliminary; follow-up ranged from 7 weeks to 6 months.

Cholangiograms demonstrated an extrinsic mass compressing the common hepatic duct in seven of eight patients. US and CT showed fairly well- to well-defined round fluid collections adjacent to the common hepatic duct in three and two patients, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that the detection at cholangiography of an extrinsic mass compressing the common hepatic duct appears to be specific for a mucocele of the allograft cystic duct remnant.

In cases of colonic carcinoma, MR images correlated well with the pathologic findings, including the macroscopic growth pattern, depth of mural invasion, and the presence of foci of calcific tumor necrosis and pools of extracellular mucin (colloid). These features suggest that MR imaging may be valuable in the clinical evaluation of colorectal tumors.\r"

The authors describe the technique, as well as the clinical and radiologic findings, that allows the safe ingestion of oral barium in patients with stenotic lesions of the colon. In all patients, oral barium passed through the small bowel and the stenotic site in an average of 148 minutes, with no complications. In seven patients, there were synchronous lesions in the colon and small bowel, and the findings were determined better with oral barium studies in 19 patients. If a barium enema study is done and retrograde passage of barium is obstructed by a lesion in the left side of the colon, additional diagnostic information can be obtained by giving the patients oral barium. This practice is safe if precise criteria are applied.\r"

Video and hard-copy interpretations were then compared for degree of concordance. For the scintigraphic studies, hard-copy and video images were equal in demonstrating gallbladder and bile duct activity. Video images failed to depict the presence of bowel activity in one case. Gallstones were depicted equally well on hard-copy and video sonographic images. The video interpreters overestimated the presence of abnormal hepatic parenchyma and overlooked one case of right hydronephrosis. The video interpretations of the scintigrams and sonograms showed an overall error rate of 4%, comparable to the rate obtained when radiographs are interpreted remotely with digital teleradiology systems.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were carried out to detect and establish the origin of Doppler and echo signal enhancement in small vessels of the systemic circulation and of tumors after intravenous injection of a contrast agent. Eight woodchucks (Marmota monax) were studied; each woodchuck had naturally occurring hepatocellular carcinoma. Injections of 0.1-4.0 mL of air-filled human serum albumin microspheres were administered into a hind limb or jugular vein. Ultrasound (US) examination included transabdominal duplex scanning, color Doppler imaging, placement of a Doppler transducer on the exposed tumor, and surgical implantation of pulsed Doppler cuffs. Doppler signals were assessed by recording color Doppler images and results of spectral analysis. While subjective echo level was unaffected within the tumors, dramatic Doppler signal enhancement was recorded in both normal and tumor vessels. At optimum dose levels, a signal gain of approximately 10 dB was recorded from the tumor. Analysis showed that the echo enhancement was due to the presence of the contrast agent in branches of the hepatic artery. These results suggest that tumor detection may be enhanced by intravenous administration of a US contrast agent.\r"

The authors' protocol varied from protocols of other researchers primarily in that no adjuvant chemolitholysis was used. However, the number of treatment sessions and total number of shock waves (a maximum of 4,000 shock waves per treatment session, 12,000 shock waves in a patient demonstrating no significant fragmentation, and 20,000 shock waves in a patient whose stones responded well to fragmentation) was higher than those in other reports. The results of treatment and complication rates in this study are comparable with those at centers using both shock-wave lithotripsy and chemotherapy. The authors conclude that EBL is developing into an important alternative to surgery, which was obviated in all patients with complete clearance of fragments from the gallbladder.\r"

Two cases of ASSC in adults with heterozygous sickle cell disease (sickle cell-thalassemia and sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease) were studied with use of duplex Doppler ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. In both cases, US showed patency of the splenic vein and multiple hypoechoic lesions on the periphery of an enlarged spleen that were of low attenuation on CT scans and hyperintense on both T1- and T2-weighted MR images. These findings were believed to be suggestive of subacute hemorrhage. This was confirmed pathologically in one case and suggested in the other by the presence of a low-signal-intensity ring, probably hemosiderin, surrounding one of the lesions. Also, the remainder of the spleen in both patients was of normal signal intensity, unlike the diminished signal intensity seen in patients with homozygous sickle cell disease. Further study is needed to determine the role of imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of ASSC.\r"

Ultrasmall superparamagnetic (mean size, 12 nm) particles of iron oxide (USPIOs) were targeted to ASG receptors by coating particles with arabinogalactan (AG). Liver T2 relaxation times decreased more effectively after a single intravenous administration of AG-USPIO than after an equal dose of a conventional superparamagnetic liver MR contrast agent (AMI-25; mean size, 72 nm). Receptor affinity studies demonstrated that receptor-mediated attachment and subsequent cellular endocytosis do not occur in primary malignant (hepatocellular carcinoma) or metastatic (adenocarcinoma) tumors, because the surface ASG receptors are lost during malignant dedifferentiation. In vitro relaxation and in vivo MR imaging experiments of liver tumors show that targeting USPIO to hepatocytes rather than to the mononuclear phagocytic system allows a considerable dose reduction, increases tumor-liver contrast, and potentially allows distinction of ASG-positive (benign hepatocellular) and ASG-negative (malignant hepatocellular) tumors.\r"

The persistent right umbilical vein may replace the normal left umbilical vein or be supernumerary. The anomaly is associated with numerous and occasionally lethal malformations. In this series, only three of six fetuses (and another two in the literature) had no associated anomalies. All the others had a variety of associated lesions ranging from minor to lethal. The appearance at ultrasound is easy to recognize: The intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein is lateral to the gallbladder, and the portal vein curves toward the stomach, instead of parallel to it. Since the recognition of the persistent right umbilical vein is simple and does not require additional scanning (it is visible in the section used to measure the abdominal perimeter), the author suggests using it as an indicator for more in-depth scanning.\r"

The creatinine level was elevated (greater than 1.5 mg/dL [133 mumol/L]) in four patients with VCME and in six patients without. This series indicates that VCME is more common than previously appreciated in patients with acute unilateral ureteral obstruction and occurs with greater frequency when obstruction is associated with contrast material extravasation.\r"

Significant differences (P less than .05) were found between the P-31 spectra of normal and azoospermic testicles in the following peak area ratios: phosphomonoester (PM)/beta-adenosine triphosphate, PM/phosphodiester, and inorganic phosphate/PM. In the patients with azoospermia, there were significant differences in these same peak area ratios between patients with primary testicular failure and those with chronic tubular obstruction. Although the differences between these two groups were statistically significant, there was a large overlap in numbers, and therefore a study with a larger patient population will be required. P-31 MR spectroscopy is a sensitive tool for assessment of testicular metabolic integrity and differentiation of normal testicles from those with markedly decreased spermatogenesis.\r"

The current study was undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of color Doppler flow imaging as a screening examination in the detection of significant RAS. Fifty-five kidneys in 30 patients were examined with aortography and color Doppler flow imaging in a double-blind fashion. The peak systolic velocity (PSV) in the renal artery, the renal-aortic ratio (RAR) (ie, the ratio of the PSV in the renal artery to the PSV in the aorta), and the renal artery resistive index were determined and compared with the percentage of stenosis as determined with angiography. Ultrasound (US) criteria used to diagnose RAS were (a) an RAR of 3.5 or greater and/or (b) a renal artery PSV of greater than 100 cm/sec. Doppler tracings were obtained in 25 (69%) of 36 kidneys with a patent single renal artery. RAR and PSV each yielded a sensitivity of 0% in the diagnosis of RAS. Doppler tracings were obtained in three (50%) of six occluded renal arteries. Accessory arteries were present in 13 (24%) of 55 kidneys, but none were visualized with color Doppler flow imaging. The authors conclude that with current technical capability, color duplex US is not an adequate screening method for the detection of RAS.\r"

The testis in the fifth patient was diffusely hyperechoic.

Scintigraphic findings were positive for testicular torsion in two patients and equivocal in three patients. Surgery was performed 2-12 days after sonography and established the diagnosis of spermatic cord torsion. Pathologic examination demonstrated hemorrhagic infarction of the entire testis as well as scattered calcifications.

In the 38 patients (all but two of whom had been fasting for 3-4 hours), 10 mL or more of nasogastric aspirate was considered indicative of obstruction. HPS occurred in 91.7% of patients with 10 mL of aspirate or more, whereas GER occurred in 85.7% of patients with less than 10 mL. The differences between the two groups were statistically significant. Solely on the basis of residual volume (greater than or equal to 10 mL), the cause of vomiting could be differentiated, prior to standard radiologic studies, 89.4% of the time. It is concluded that patients with projectile vomiting who have 10 mL or more of residual aspirate in the stomach should undergo US for confirmation of HPS; those with less than 10 mL should undergo fluoroscopy for confirmation of GER.\r"

On sagittal MR images, these structures had a configuration with the appearance of a \"Y\" or \"7\". Four of these six patients underwent bilateral laminotomies.

Myocardial tagging with magnetic resonance imaging is a new method of assessing heart wall motion during contraction. Current methods of myocardial tagging either do not provide two-dimensional information or lack a coordinate system well adapted to the morphology of the heart. In this article, the authors describe a new tagging method that provides a true polar coordinate system, with both radial and angular dimensions. This is accomplished with use of a section-selective version of spatially modulated magnetization resulting in striped tags (STAGs). These STAG planes are placed in the myocardium in a star pattern so that they intersect on the long axis of the heart and stripes appear through the width of the heart wall. In the short-axis view during contraction, rotation around the long axis yields angular information such as shear and twist, while separation of the stripes within the myocardium permits measurement of radial thickening. Therefore, this method provides a coordinate system for calculating two-dimensional strain that is adapted to the morphology of the left ventricle.\r"

Biphasic spin-echo MR images covering the entire heart were obtained with use of the electrocardiogram R wave and the downslope of the T wave at both end diastole and end systole, respectively. Biphasic MR-determined values correlated well with small standard errors of the estimate (end-diastolic volume = 7.82 cm3, end-diastolic mass = 10.20 g, end-systolic mass = 10.08 g, ejection fraction = 2.62%) and were more reproducible. Cine MR-defined end-systolic volume was significantly larger (P less than .01) and ejection fraction was significantly smaller (P less than .005) than biphasic MR-determined values probably because of the uncertainty in isolating end systole with cine MR. Left ventricular volumes, mass, and ejection fraction are more accurately and reproducibly quantified in a more time-efficient manner with use of biphasic MR than with cine MR because of its significantly shorter image acquisition and reconstruction times.\r"

The diagnosis of intramural hematoma was made by the detection of increased signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MR images.

Because of the small diameter of the compressed stent (7 F), primary implantation of the stent without a previous catheter drainage was preferred. Postprocedural complications occurred in three patients (5%) (biliary pleuritis, peritonitis, hepatic artery aneurysm). The 30-day mortality rate was 8.2%. Reocclusions were observed in six of the patients with malignant obstructions (11%) (observation period, 1-10 months; mean, 4.5 months) and in two of the patients with benign stenoses (25%) (observation period, 3-21 months; mean, 9 months). The higher reocclusion rate of benign obstructions must be interpreted with care because of the small number of patients. From their preliminary experience, the authors conclude that expandable metal endoprostheses offer patency rates equal to those of plastic stents. The implantation trauma is reduced due to the small 7-F introducing catheter system.\r"

  ".W": "An expandable metallic transhepatic biliary endoprosthesis was used to treat 20 patients with hilar malignancy and isolated right and left intrahepatic ducts. In 12 patients, only one intrahepatic ductal system was drained; in eight patients, both systems were drained. In five patients, both systems were drained through a single transhepatic track by arrangement of two stents in a T configuration. The initial technical success rate in placing the stents and achieving internal drainage was 100%. Complications necessitating further intervention occurred in two of the 20 patients. Short-term clinical follow-up was available for 19 of the 20 patients. Two months after stent insertion, two patients complained of persistent jaundice, two patients died without jaundice, and 15 patients were free of symptoms of biliary obstruction. A variety of geometric configurations are possible with this endoprosthesis. The relative merits of these stent arrangements are discussed, and a new technique for placing the stents in a T configuration is described.\r"

In the five cases of stenosis, only balloon dilation was performed prior to placement of stents. The five patients with occluded arteries were given intraarterial infusions of urokinase before balloon dilation and stent placement. Clinical symptoms improved in all patients, and no technical failures or complications occurred. Doppler ankle-brachial index studies were performed in nine cases, and in all nine cases the indexes improved after stent placement. During follow-up of 2-18 months (mean, 10.3 months), all arteries remained patent. Follow-up angiograms showed slight intimal thickening and no restenosis. Long-term follow-up and more clinical experience will be necessary to evaluate the efficacy of this stent. However, preliminary results suggest that the Gianturco expandable metallic stent is of value in the treatment of arterial occlusive disease.\r"

For example, extensive comedocarcinoma is associated with large areas of mammographically visible calcium deposition. The authors identified 10 women in whom calcifications were visible throughout large volumes of breast tissue at mammography. The calcifications did not resemble those typical of extensive comedocarcinoma, yet they were associated with extensive breast cancer. Their mammographic pattern was characterized by a strikingly wild, chaotic appearance with profuse deposition of calcium. As in many cancers, the particles were heterogeneous, but unlike in most carcinomas, many deposits had a typically benign morphology. Histologic examination showed that even these typically benign calcifications were associated with malignant cells. The authors believe that the apocrine features displayed by many of the cancer cells in these 10 patients may explain the unusual profusion of calcium deposits.\r"

The total annual collective breast dose, meanwhile, increased at a much slower rate, from 40 person-Gy in 1978 to 97 person-Gy in 1988; this difference is attributable to the gradual replacement of xeroradiography by screen-film mammography and to changes in technique. In the late 1980s, the AGD due to xeroradiography for a craniocaudal view was 3.3 mGy, a factor of 2.4 greater than the corresponding dose associated with dedicated screen-film units.\r"

Six cadaver shoulders were examined with MR, and histologic correlation was obtained in four. All studies were performed at 1.5 T with a flexible circular surface coil. The accuracy of MR imaging in detection of full-thickness cuff tears (31 patients) was 0.95 and of partial thickness tears (16 patients), 0.84. The most common and accurate pattern for full-thickness cuff tears (22 of 31 tears) was a region of intense signal seen on T2-weighted images. Less often the torn region consisted of an extremely degenerated and attenuated tendon with moderate signal intensity or was obscured by low-signal-intensity scar. The intense signal pattern on T2-weighted images was also accurate, although a less common finding (seven of 16 cases), in the diagnosis of partial tears. Tendinitis was recognized as focal or diffuse regions of increased signal intensity or a nonhomogeneous pattern of increased signal often associated with tendinous enlargement. In some patients, manifestations of subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis was present. Tendon degeneration was also manifested as regions of increased signal intensity. Some similarity and overlap of signal patterns of partial interstitial tears, tendinitis, and tendon degeneration are observed.\r"

These numbers and muscle/soft-tissue ratios of the lower extremity were compared. Findings were correlated with results of muscle biopsy in all patients with suspected disease. Using the number of perimysial septa in the lower extremity, the authors found significant differences between the muscles of healthy volunteers and those of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophies, other muscular dystrophies, and spinal muscular atrophies: The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that an average of 12 perimysial septa within 1 cm of muscle is the ideal cutoff value to differentiate subjects without morphologic changes from those with pathologic findings. The authors conclude that this measurement is useful for differentiation of neuromuscular diseases and may be a noninvasive, reproducible means with which to evaluate disease progression.\r"

At radiologic examination of these patients with cystic RA, the first abnormality seen consisted of periarticular intraosseous cysts without erosions. The cysts were distributed symmetrically, most often located at the proximal side of the joints and predominantly around the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, and wrist joints of the hands and the first interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints of the feet. Computed tomographic scans showed the peripheral intraosseous location of the cysts. Magnetic resonance images showed that the cysts may contain fluid, inflamed synovia, or both. Cysts can be an important feature in the diagnosis of RA and a supplement to the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association. Osteoporosis, joint-space narrowing, and joint destruction occurred less frequently in patients with cystic RA than in patients with classic RA. Of the patients with cystic RA, 54% were male, and 50% were seronegative. This study is a supplement to and an enlargement on earlier descriptions of cyst predominance in RA.\r"

In 25 patients, small cell lung cancer was staged prospectively with both conventional staging and a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging protocol that included 1.5-T MR imaging of the pelvis, abdomen, spine, and brain. According to conventional staging, 14 patients had extensive disease and 11 patients had limited disease; according to staging with MR, 19 patients had extensive disease and six had limited disease. All metastatic disease sites seen with conventional staging were identified on MR images. MR images showed additional metastatic involvement in bone (four patients) and liver (three patients) not detected at conventional staging. A low-attenuation hepatic lesion on a CT scan was identified as a hemangioma on MR images. These preliminary data suggest that small cell lung cancer may be accurately staged with use of a single MR imaging study.\r"

Findings at AMPR CT, conventional CT, and digital radiographic tomography were compared with findings obtained at evaluation of the resected specimen with regard to the ability to display the relationships between vessels, bronchi, and lesions. AMPR CT was significantly superior to conventional CT and digital radiographic tomography in detecting involvement of pulmonary vessels (P less than .001). Involvement of pulmonary veins was seen in all lung cancers, whereas such involvement was seen in only one of eight nonneoplastic lesions. Thus, involvement of pulmonary veins is strongly suggestive of malignancy. AMPR CT permits three-dimensional visualization and morphologic assessment of pulmonary nodules.\r"

The nonsearch protocol identified each finding (by film location), and reviewers rated the likelihood of each finding's being a pulmonary nodule. The search protocol asked reviewers to report and rate all locations regarded as possible nodules on each radiograph and assigned a default negative rating to any unreported finding (nodule or normal structure). Receiver operating characteristic analyses demonstrated a significantly higher accuracy for each reviewer's search-protocol discriminations between these nodules and ambiguous normal findings. This superiority-of-search result suggests that radiologists' second opinions about suspected lesions might be more accurate when consultants follow a search protocol, independently reviewing radiographs without prior knowledge of the specific findings that concerned the primary radiograph readers.\r"

Experience with the use of an intravenously administered iodinated contrast medium in examining the enhancement properties of lung masses was reviewed. Distinctive differences in the vascularity, pathophysiologic features, and pharmacodynamics of malignant versus benign pulmonary masses were identified. Forty-five patients with peripheral pulmonary masses were examined. Enhancement was evaluated by means of optical density values measured on trispiral tomograms of the lung masses before and after bolus injection of contrast medium. Results suggest that contrast enhancement of pulmonary masses can be measured on sectional images and that this may become a feasible diagnostic method in the detection of lung cancer. CT offers a simplified technique that is now being explored by the authors.\r"

As a result of this memory, males made familiar by mating are recognized by the females, thereby mitigating pregnancy block. Such a memory function is biologically important to the female, as it is required to sustain pregnancy in the presence of her stud male's odors.\r"

Analysis of retroviral recombinants formed after a single round of replication revealed that (i) the nonselected markers changed more frequently than expected from the rate of recombination of selected markers; (ii) the transfer of the initially synthesized minus strand strong stop DNA was either intramolecular or intermolecular; (iii) the transfer of the first synthesized plus strand strong stop DNA was always intramolecular; and (iv) there was a strong correlation between the type of transfer of the minus strand strong stop DNA and the number of template switches observed. These data suggest that retroviral recombination is ordered and occurs during the synthesis of both minus and plus strand DNA.\r"

The dominantly inherited Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is of particular interest because of the diversity of childhood and adult tumors that occur in affected individuals. The rarity and high mortality of LFS precluded formal linkage analysis. The alternative approach was to select the most plausible candidate gene. The tumor suppressor gene, p53, was studied because of previous indications that this gene is inactivated in the sporadic (nonfamilial) forms of most cancers that are associated with LFS. Germ line p53 mutations have been detected in all five LFS families analyzed. These mutations do not produce amounts of mutant p53 protein expected to exert a trans-dominant loss of function effect on wild-type p53 protein. The frequency of germ line p53 mutations can now be examined in additional families with LFS, and in other cancer patients and families with clinical features that might be attributed to the mutation.\r"

Epidermal growth factor elicits tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis in various cell lines. The ability of tyrosine phosphorylation to activate the catalytic activity of PLC-gamma 1 was tested. Tyrosine phosphorylation in intact cells or in vitro increased the catalytic activity of PLC-gamma 1. Also, treatment of EGF-activated PLC-gamma 1 with a tyrosine-specific phosphatase substantially decreased the catalytic activity of PLC-gamma 1. These results suggest that the EGF-stimulated formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol in intact cells results, at least in part, from catalytic activation of PLC-gamma 1 through tyrosine phosphorylation.\r"

When these gramicidins were added asymmetrically, one to each side of a preformed bilayer, the predominant channel type was the hybrid channel, formed between two chemically dissimilar monomers. These channels formed by the association of monomers residing in each half of the membrane. These results also indicate that the hydrophobic gramicidins are surprisingly membrane impermeant, a conclusion that was confirmed in experiments in which gA was added asymmetrically and symmetrically to preformed bilayers.\r"

However, binding of this protein to DNA in a sequence-specific manner has not been demonstrated. A synthetic gene was constructed that contained the zinc finger region, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was used to identify a specific DNA binding site from a pool of degenerate oligonucleotides. The binding sites obtained were similar to the sequence recognized by the early growth response-1 (EGR-1) gene product, a zinc finger-containing protein that is induced by mitogenic stimuli. A mutation in the zinc finger region of the protein originally identified in a Wilms' tumor patient abolished its DNA-binding activity. These results suggest that the WTL protein may act at the DNA binding site of a growth factor-inducible gene and that loss of DNA-binding activity contributes to the tumorigenic process.\r"

This gene is not essential for viral growth in cell culture. Four recombinant viruses were genetically engineered to test the function of this gene. These were (i) a virus from which both copies of the gene were deleted, (ii) a virus containing a stop codon in both copies of the gene, (iii) a virus containing after the first codon an insert encoding a 16-amino acid epitope known to react with a specific monoclonal antibody, and (iv) a virus in which the deleted sequences were restored. The viruses from which the gene was deleted or which carried stop codons were avirulent on intracerebral inoculation of mice. The virus with the gene tagged by the sequence encoding the epitope was moderately virulent, whereas the restored virus reacquired the phenotype of the parent virus. Significant amounts of virus were recovered only from brains of animals inoculated with virulent viruses. Inasmuch as the product of the gamma 134.5 gene extended the host range of the virus by enabling it to replicate and destroy brain cells, it is a viral neurovirulence factor.\r"

The hypothesis that mechanical distension directly stimulates type II cells to secrete surfactant was tested by stretching type II cells cultured on silastic membranes. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured in single cells, before and after stretching. A single stretch of alveolar type II cells caused a transient (less than 60 seconds) increase in cytosolic Ca2+ followed by a sustained (15 to 30 minutes) stimulation of surfactant secretion. Both Ca2+ mobilization and exocytosis exhibited dose-dependence to the magnitude of the stretch-stimulus. Thus, mechanical factors can trigger complex cellular events in nonneuron, nonmuscle cells and may be involved in regulating normal lung functions.\r"

There were large amounts of glutamate in boutons making synaptic contact with neuroendocrine neurons in the arcuate, paraventricular, and supraoptic nuclei. Almost all medial hypothalamic neurons responded to glutamate and to the glutamate agonists quisqualate and kainate with a consistent increase in intracellular calcium. In all magnocellular and parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei tested, the non-NMDA (non-N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamate antagonist CNQX (cyano-2,3-dihydroxy-7-nitroquinoxaline) reduced electrically stimulated and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials, suggesting that the endogenous neurotransmitter is an excitatory amino acid acting primarily on non-NMDA receptors. These results indicate that glutamate plays a major, widespread role in the control of neuroendocrine neurons.\r"

The virus has not been classified because neither an infectious particle nor a specific nucleic acid had been identified. To identify the genome of BDV, a subtractive complementary DNA expression library was constructed with polyadenylate-selected RNA from a BDV-infected MDCK cell line. A clone (B8) was isolated that specifically hybridized to RNA isolated from BDV-infected brain tissue and BDV-infected cell lines. This clone hybridized to four BDV-specific positive strand RNAs (10.5, 3.6, 2.1, and 0.85 kilobases) and one negative strand RNA (10.5 kilobases) in BDV-infected rat brain. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the clone suggested that it represented a full-length messenger RNA which contained several open reading frames. In vitro transcription and translation of the clone resulted in the synthesis of the 14- and 24-kilodalton BDV-specific proteins. The 24-kilodalton protein, when translated in vitro from the clone, was recognized by antibodies in the sera of patients (three of seven) with behavioral disorders. This BDV-specific clone will provide the means to isolate the other BDV-specific nucleic acids and to identify the virus responsible for Borna disease. In addition, the significance of BDV or a BDV-related virus as a human pathogen can now be more directly examined.\r"

Patients with a benign outcome had an average age of 55 years versus 63 years for patients with carcinoma of the breast. Seventy-six per cent of these patients had no previous history of mammary problems, 20 per cent had a positive family history for carcinoma of the breast, 58 per cent were premenopausal and 21 per cent had used birth control pills. Except for age (p less than 0.001), the distribution of clinical risk factors was equal among patients with benign or malignant outcomes. Suspicious mammographic findings included mass lesions (53 per cent), calcifications (36 per cent) and the association of both (11 per cent). The predominant Wolfe pattern on mammography was P1 (36 per cent). No relationship was observed between Wolfe pattern and malignant conditions. In this group of patients, mammography was poorly specific; however, the positive predictive value increased with age and is related to the age-specific prevalence of carcinoma of the breast. Eight hundred and twenty-five lesions were removed. Twenty-five per cent (n = 203) of the specimens taken at biopsy contained carcinoma. Stellate mass lesions were highly suggestive of a malignant growth (p less than 0.0001). No relationship between the size of the suspicious mammographic mass and the malignant lesion was observed. A marked correlation (chi-square test with Yate's correction) was observed between malignant tumor and lesions with a linear or branching pattern, more than 15 calcifications, or small sized calcifications. The presence of a mass with calcifications was associated with carcinoma in 34 per cent. The incidence of invasive carcinoma was much higher for mass lesions (81 per cent) than for suspicious calcifications (56 per cent) (p less than 0.0001).\r"

EPSS permanently controlled the variceal bleeding in all but one patient. In this patient, the shunt was patent as demonstrated by angiography. Esophageal varices disappeared in 18 patients and were reduced in 14. Three patients died before the endoscopic examination could be performed. The causes of death were hepatic failure in two and bleeding ulcerations of the gastric fundus in the other patient. One patient was classified in Child's category B and two in Child's category C. Thirty-two patients submitted to EPSS and were discharged alive. Twelve of these patients subsequently died, at an average of 11.2 months after undergoing the shunt procedure. Four of 12 patients died of hepatic failure; two patients died of hepatomas; two, other neoplasia; three, hemorrhaging duodenal ulcers, and one patient, renal failure. Analysis of actuarial survival rates showed that the five year survival rate was 43 per cent. The long term survival rates were fewer for patients with Child's category C than for those with combined Child's categories A and B (five year survival rates were 21 versus 55 per cent; p less than 0.05). During the follow-up period, none of the patients had variceal bleeding. Chronic encephalopathy developed in six, which was mild in three, moderate in one instance and severe in two. It developed soon after EPSS, with onset in the first month after discharge in three. Thus, when conservative treatment fails to arrest variceal bleeding, EPSS should be performed to guarantee definitive control of hemorrhage and prolong the survival period.\r"

The succinate dehydrogenase (SD) activity of tissue fragments taken at biopsy was assayed after exposure to heat (43 degrees C.) and radiation (6 grays) was done. The sensitivity to radiation plus heat treatment was estimated by the percentage of SD activity of the treated cells, compared with that of the control cells. The 43 patients were divided into three groups according to the degree of SD activity after exposure to radiation plus heat treatment. The SD activity was less than 50 per cent in group 1 (highly sensitive), between 50 and 70 per cent in group 2 (moderately sensitive), more than 70 per cent in group 3 (less sensitive). Eighteen of 20 in group 1, 11 of 17 in group 2 and two of six in group 3 were classified as being histopathologically \"effective\" for HCR therapy. The two year survival rate for groups 1, 2 and 3 were 55.5, 34.9 and zero per cent, respectively, while there were no statistical differences with regard to prognostic factors. These data suggest that in vitro activities of SD correlate well with the clinical effectiveness of HCR therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that a SD inhibition test be included among the guidelines for clinical management.\r"

  ".W": "Partial gastric resection for benign ulcer disease has been associated with an increased incidence of mucosal dysplasia and invasive adenocarcinoma, particularly 15 to 20 years after resection. These remnant carcinomas are particularly virulent with little hope of resection or cure once symptoms occur. Using a planned protocol of routine endoscopic surveillance with biopsy, the goal was to identify early markers of neoplasia, that is, dysplasia, and a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the gastric remnant, while both resection and cure were possible. Between July 1980 and August 1988, yearly flexible gastroscopic examination and random biopsy have been performed on 163 patients at least ten years after gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease. All biopsy results were interpreted for findings of dysplasia and early gastric adenocarcinoma. Results of this ongoing screening program revealed dysplasia of the gastric remnant in nine patients with eventual findings of adenocarcinoma in four of this group. These patients underwent total gastrectomy with findings of limited disease. Five patients with mucosal dysplasia continue to be observed at six month intervals. Three additional gastric carcinomas were found on initial gastroscopic screening, while one patient had adenocarcinoma diagnosed during a third yearly gastroscopic examination. These eight asymptomatic patients with adenocarcinoma in the gastric remnant had a postgastrectomy interval which ranged from 15 to 29 years (mean of 26.5 years). The results of this study support the concept of neoplastic change in the gastric remnant as a function of time from initial gastric resection. Findings of dysplasia on random biopsy indicate a greater likelihood of development of carcinoma of the gastric remnant and identify a subset of patients requiring aggressive endoscopic surveillance.\r"

  ".W": "Revascularization of the extremity was performed upon 110 patients after preoperative radionuclide ventriculography (RNVG). Mean ejection fraction (EF) was 50 +/- 13 per cent. Ventricular wall motion abnormalities were present in 46 per cent. Revascularization included inflow procedures, such as aortofemoral (n = 25) or extraanatomic bypass (axillofemoral or femorofemoral, n = 11); infrainguinal reconstruction, including femoropopliteal or distal bypass (n = 43), and other procedures to improve perfusion of the limb or correct complications after previous vascular reconstruction upon the extremity (n = 31). Perioperative (30 days) mortality rate was 0.9 per cent and 97.0 per cent of the patients were discharged alive from the hospital. Myocardial infarction (MI) occurred in 3.6 per cent, new ventricular arrhythmia in 1.8 per cent and congestive heart failure in 6.4 per cent of the patients during the perioperative period. During follow-up study (607 +/- 363 days), 7.3 per cent required major amputation, ipsilateral to reconstruction, 5.5 per cent required surgical or angiographic revision for hemodynamic failure of the reconstruction prior to thrombosis and 12.7 per cent thrombosed part or all of the reconstruction. Revascularization failure did not appear to be related to the level of cardiac function. Those with normal (greater than 50 per cent) EF had greater over-all survival by life table analysis than those with EF less than or equal to 50 per cent (p = 0.0006, Mantel-Cox test). Ventricular wall motion abnormalities were associated with reduced over-all survival (p = 0.008, Mantel-Cox test). The presence of angina or previous MI, singularly or in combination, did not have an adverse effect on over-all survival, whereas diabetes (p = 0.0058, Mantel-Cox test) and cigarette smoking (p = 0.0137, Breslow test) were associated with significantly diminished over-all survival. Preoperative RNVG can identify subgroups at a survival disadvantage after revascularization of the extremity in a population in which the presence of angina or previous MI does not predict survival.\r"

We evaluated the incidence of extensive rebleeding and mortality rate. The period of study was 54 months and the mean follow-up period was 21 months. Forty-one patients had severe rebleeding and a majority of the episodes occurred during the first year. Only four patients had more than five sessions of sclerosis when rebleeding occurred. The probability rate for patients to be free of severe rebleeding after 48 months, according to Pugh's classification, was 88 per cent for those with grade A, 50 percent for grade B and 43 percent for grade C. The over-all mortality rate was 38.8 per cent (53 patients), with the highest rate noted during the first year. The mortality rate of patients with severe rebleeding was much higher than that of those who did not rebleed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at four years was 52 per cent, and survival rates in relation to Pugh's classification were 73 per cent for A, 53 per cent for B and 34 per cent for C. Differences between the three groups were statistically significant. Therefore, because of the high mortality rate associated with patients with cirrhosis and extensive rebleeding during the first year, it is important to achieve, as soon as possible, eradication of esophageal varices.\r"

The data reported herein suggest the principal barrier to permeability may be glycosaminoglycans (GAG) of the surface of the bladder. We examined the ability of surface GAG to prevent a small molecule, urea, from moving across the epithelium in humans. It appears that GAG provide a physical barrier which prevents small molecules from reaching the underlying tight junctions and cell membranes and, hence, are a major permeability barrier. Normal volunteers (27) had 100 milliliters of a 200 grams per liter urea solution placed into their bladders for 45 minutes. Net flow of urea from the bladder lumen was 5.1 per cent. Volunteers who were capable of completing the study (19) had protamine sulfate (5 milligrams per milliliter) instilled in the bladder for 15 minutes, then removed and a second urea study done. Urea loss was significantly higher at 22 per cent (p less than 0.02). A solution of heparin (2,000 units per milliliter) was instilled for 15 minutes followed by a third urea study and urea loss was reversed to 9 per cent.

From 1984 to 1988, 18 patients underwent reconstruction of the carotid artery in an attempt to restore normal retinal arterial flow and, thereby, reverse or prevent progression of ischemic oculopathy. During a mean period of 21 months after carotid arterial reconstruction, subjective improvement in vision as well as a resolution in eye and periorbital pain was reported in 87.5 per cent of the patients. Measured visual acuity improved or stabilized in 94.4 per cent; macular photostress recovery times improved in 87.5 per cent, funduscopic examinations noted improvement or resolution in ischemic signs in 93.3 per cent and intraocular pressures improved in two of three patients. One patient experienced recurrent episodes of amaurosis fugax, which resolved after two weeks and did not recur. A second patient experienced an increase in intraocular pressures with visual deterioration, required laser photocoagulation after which the condition of the patient stabilized but only after significant visual impairment. Carotid arterial reconstruction is effective for the treatment of ischemic oculopathy and is most beneficial if performed early, before the onset of irreversible neovascular glaucoma.\r"

There is no proof that diabetic patients have more gallstones. Gallstones do not cause diabetes mellitus. The principal gallbladder pathologic feature in diabetic patients is a functional deficit of uncertain etiologic factors, creating a large, flaccid, poorly emptying organ. Bile acid and lipid composition are usually increased in diabetic patients. Cholecystitis seems to be a more serious disease in diabetic patients, with worse infectious sequelae and more rapid disease progression. This conclusion has not been examined statistically. Even with modern care, the complication rate for operations upon the biliary tract in patients with diabetes is increased. Those with diabetes are generally older than other patients requiring cholecystectomy. Systemic changes of aging partly explain increased morbidity and mortality. Diabetic patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease usually require operation. Risk of cholecystectomy in diabetic patients is similar to that in nondiabetics. Prophylactic cholecystectomy for diabetic patients with \"silent\" gallstones was formerly recommended because of an apparent high risk of cholecystitis. Until the natural history of gallstones in those with diabetes has been defined, such patients should be considered in danger of serious illness. The risk of acute cholecystitis in diabetic patients with stones is probably significant enough to warrant the performance of early cholecystectomy.\r"

  ".W": "From the initial clinical descriptions of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981 to the present time, much has been discovered concerning the epidemiologic factors, pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of this disease. Recent advances in epidemiology have included a better understanding of the occupational risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection after percutaneous exposure (responsible for approximately 0.4 per cent of instances), an appreciation of the potential variability in the time interval between infection and seroconversion (generally on the order of three months but occasionally longer) and establishment of the need for intimate contact to transmit infection. Following the discovery of HIV-1 as the etiologic agent of AIDS, many rapid advances have been possible including the development of screening tests, elucidation of the HIV-1 genome and the discovery that the CD4 T lymphocyte is the predominant cell destroyed by HIV-1. Progressive destruction of CD4 T cells results in a progressive decline in immunologic function that may take a variety of clinical forms, ranging from no symptoms to severe opportunistic infections. The delineation of the life cycle of HIV-1 has helped in the development of antiretroviral therapies, including agents that interfere with reverse transcription (nucleoside analogues, such as zidovudine, dideoxycytidine, dideoxyinosine and azidodideoxyuridine) and agents that interfere with viral assembly (protease inhibitors and interferon alpha). A more precise understanding of the nature of the immune response elicited after HIV-1 infection has resulted in the development of several candidate HIV-1 vaccines, including recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the HIV-1 envelope and recombinant envelope proteins.\r"

  ".U": "91057749\r", 
  ".W": "Aztreonam is the first monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic (monobactam) to be tested clinically. Its synthetic structure determines specific areas of activity, including enhanced activity against Pseudomonas species, exceptional activity against gram-negative bacteria, stability to beta-lactamases and lack of activity against gram-positive bacteria--all of which can be directly related to its chemical composition. Aztreonam has a high affinity for the protein-binding protein 3 (PBP-3) of aerobic gram-negative bacteria. Most of these organisms are inhibited and killed at low concentrations of the drug. Aztreonam binds poorly to PBP sites of the aerobic gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria and consequently has relatively poor inhibitory effects against these bacteria. In vitro, minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values against almost all of the Enterobacteriaceae and against Neisseria and Haemophilus strains are typically below 1 microgram per milliliter. MIC values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa of 8 micrograms per milliliter are comparable with those of other antipseudomonal beta-lactams and the acylureidopenicillins. As combination therapy with amino-glycosides, aztreonam acts in synergy against P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter and gentamicin-resistant gram-negative rods. Aztreonam is widely distributed in the body tissues and fluids, and the average elimination half-life is 1.7 hours. Intramuscular dosing results in peak serum levels in approximately one hour, while intravenous dosing results in peak levels within five minutes. After a 2 gram dose given intravenously, MIC90 values for most of the Enterobacteriaceae are exceeded for eight hours, and those for P. aeruginosa, for almost six hours. The steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 0.18 liter per kilogram. Concentrations above the MIC90 for most gram-negative bacteria are also present within bone, prostate and cerebrospinal fluid. Between 60 and 70 per cent of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, resulting in concentrations approximating 3,000 micrograms per milliliter two hours after a 1 gram dose given intravenously. Serum clearance of aztreonam is directly proportional to creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustment must, therefore, be made in the presence of reduced clearance. Dosing varies between 0.5 and 2.0 grams every six to 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection. The characteristics of aztreonam suggest that it is a useful nonnephrotoxic drug for treatment of aerobic gram-negative infection.\r"

Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is one of the most frequent causes of iatrogenic renal failure. A narrow toxicity to therapeutic ratio, a relatively long serum half-life and concentration in the renal cortex all contribute to renal dysfunction. Patients at greatest risk for aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity include the elderly, patients with pre-existing renal disease and those who are volume depleted. Calculations based on the results of a multicenter study demonstrate that the average additional cost incurred for each patient who had aminoglycoside-related nephrotoxicity was $2,501. Methods are reviewed for prospectively assessing the potential for development of nephrotoxicity to identify patients for whom effective therapeutic substitutes for aminoglycosides should be sought.\r"

Prompt diagnosis is particularly important for patients in SICU because the mortality rate associated with pneumonia in these patients may be as high as 50 per cent. In the SICU setting, pneumonia is best diagnosed using well-defined roentgenologic criteria. Treatment should consist of a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen to which all sputum pathogens are sensitive. Such a regimen significantly reduces the mortality rate for patients with pneumonia in an SICU setting. Aztreonam has been found to be as effective against susceptible gram-negative bacilli as traditional agents, such as the aminoglycosides, and to have a significantly milder side effect profile.\r"

However, the widespread administration of potent antibacterials and the frequent use of a variety of catheters, along with an increase in the number of immune compromised patients requiring invasive procedures, have allowed deep-seated mycoses to become more common. Nosocomial fungal infections are frequent, particularly in the urinary tract and in the blood. This rise in identified fungal infections, along with frequent empiric treatment of suspected infection, has significantly increased amphotericin B therapy in surgical services in the last five years. While amphotericin B remains the standard for treatment of nosocomial mycoses, other antifungal agents are available (flucytosine, miconazole, ketoconazole and fluconazole). Despite experience with the older agents and the development of new agents, many questions remain concerning the use of currently available antifungal treatments in postsurgical patients. The following discussion attempts to summarize the magnitude of the problem, the difficulties with diagnosis and laboratory evaluations, the characteristics of the antifungal agents and particular problems with antifungal treatment in surgery.\r"

In this study, four noteworthy factors were found: (1) the incidence of unruptured aneurysms was higher in elderly patients aged 60 years or older, and the peak percentage was 1.2% in the seventh decade; (2) aneurysms occurred more frequently in females than males, with a ratio of 53:31; (3) the most common site of aneurysms was the middle cerebral artery; 37 of 102 aneurysms (36%) occurred on it; and (4) the rate of small aneurysms was very high; 50 of 93 aneurysms (54%) were 4 mm or less in diameter, and 33 aneurysms (35%) were 5-9 mm in diameter. However, relationships could not be found between age distribution and location, size, or thickness of walls; between gender and size or thickness of walls; between location and size or thickness of walls; or between size and thickness of walls. Based on published statistics on subarachnoid hemorrhage and this study, the rupture rate of unruptured aneurysms seems to be very low. Although the risk of rupture may be relatively low in small aneurysms, its low risk probably cannot be explained adequately by morphological examination only.\r"

Computed tomography scan-derived ventricular-brain ratio as an expression of hydrocephalus varied between 9.3% and 15.4% (12.9% +/- 1.7%). One hour prior to surgery each patient received 1 g of vancomycin infused intravenously over 60 minutes. Samples of cerebrospinal fluid and venous blood were obtained 1 hour later and vancomycin levels assayed by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. There were 11 females and 14 males, with a mean age of 44.5 +/- 10.3 years and a mean weight of 72.0 +/- 11.4 kg. All had normal renal function. Levels of vancomycin in the cerebrospinal fluid at 1 hour ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 micrograms/mL (0.9 +/- 0.3). Weight did not affect these values (p greater than 0.1). Simultaneous blood vancomycin levels varied between 9.1 and 38.7 micrograms/mL (22.3 +/- 8.3). Ventricular volume, expressed as the ventricular-brain ratio, did not correlate with cerebrospinal fluid vancomycin levels (p greater than 0.5). There was no significant increase in concentrations of vancomycin in CSF as cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration increased, nor when blood vancomycin concentration was greater than 20 mg/dL (therapeutic range) (p greater than 0.1). No patient had evidence of infection at 6 months follow up. These results indicate minimal cerebrospinal fluid penetrance of vancomycin when administered systemically 1 hour prior to shunt surgery. In addition concentrations of vancomycin in cerebrospinal fluid bear no relationship to weight, ventricular volume, meningeal inflammation, or blood levels in the therapeutic range. The minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin for staphylococci is 1.5 to 3.1, and as bactericidal levels of 5 to 8 minimum inhibitory concentration are needed to kill organisms, a combination of both systemic and intraventricular vancomycin may be needed to ensure adequate cerebrospinal fluid and tissue concentration of antibiotic during shunt prophylaxis.\r"

Before treatment, the mean PI in the anterior cerebral arteries was significantly higher than the mean PI in the basilar artery. All PI ratios increased to 1.00 or more. After treatment and in normal infants, the mean PI in the anterior cerebral arteries was significantly lower than the mean PI in the basilar artery. All PI ratios decreased to less than 1.00. We believe that the PI ratio is useful to evaluate the need or effect of treatment in hydrocephalus.\r"

In all rats, tumor was enhanced with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). The necrotic portion in the tumor, however, was not enhanced. Hemorrhage and hydrocephalus were clearly visualized on both the precontrast and postcontrast images. Blood-brain barrier-disrupted areas stained with Evans blue and areas enhanced with Gd-DTPA on magnetic resonance imaging were nearly consistent. It is suggested that the mechanism of brain tumor enhancement with Gd-DTPA on magnetic resonance imaging is simply related to the degree of alteration of the blood-brain barrier. The Gd-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, even with low magnetic field, is useful for the evaluation of size, shape, and location of experimental rat brain tumors.\r"

This experimental model has the advantage of simultaneously measuring the regional changes in cerebral blood flow as well as the metabolism. The ischemic area demonstrated by the accumulation of NADH is confined to the cerebral cortex and becomes enlarged in proportion to the increase in venous pressure. This metabolic disturbance appears even in the very early period following cerebral venous hypertension. These pathophysiological features are different from those observed in the case of intracranial hypertension.\r"

The average regional cerebral circulation time values were significantly prolonged in the frontal, temporal, and thalamic regions, most markedly in the frontal white matter, where periventricular lucency was observed on computed tomography. Clinical improvement was obtained in all patients after operation. While postoperative regional cerebral blood flow values did not change compared with preoperative ones, postoperative regional cerebral circulation time values were significantly reduced in all the regions measured, and most markedly in the frontal white matter. The present results suggest that microcirculation in the frontal lobe is closely correlated with dementia in association with pressure exerted on the nerve fibers in the frontal white matter in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus.\r"

  ".W": "Considering that the 1.32-microns Nd-YAG laser should have physicothermal properties close to those of the CO2 laser, a series of experiments were conducted on rat cortex (N = 51). Three laser wavelengths were compared: CO2 laser (10.6 microns), 1.06-microns Nd-YAG, and 1.32-microns Nd-YAG lasers. For each shot, temperature measurements were recorded with an infrared thermographic videocamera. The digitized signals were figured as thermal profiles and temperature developments. Ninety-five shots were correctly studied and analyzed: CO2, N = 29; 1.06-microns Nd-YAG, N = 20; 1.32-microns Nd-YAG, N = 46. The histological lesions produced by these three lasers were compared on animals killed 24 hours (N = 20), 8 days (N = 20), and 30 days (N = 5) after the laser impacts. For equivalent densities of energy, the depth of cortical necrosis was comparable for the CO2 laser (200-250 microns) and the 1.32-microns Nd-YAG laser (210-260 microns) whatever the date of death; the 1.06-microns Nd-YAG laser shots were responsible for much more important damage (400-550 microns). Because of its important absorption in water and nervous tissue, the authors consider the 1.32-microns Nd-YAG laser most suitable for neurosurgery, particularly because it is conducted through optic fibers, and therefore is easy to handle during neurosurgical procedures.\r"

Following identification of the pathogenic organism, antibiotic therapy was continued until the patients demonstrated clinical improvement and radiological resolution of the abscess. All patients remained stable or improved neurologically. Analysis of 33 previously reported patients treated with antibiotics suggests that nonoperative treatment may be a reasonable alternative therapy under certain clinical conditions. These include (1) identification of the pathogenic organism, (2) a stable neurological condition, (3) access to magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography for potentially rapid reevaluation, and (4) appropriate neurosurgical consultation and nursing care. Nonoperative treatment may also be considered as a reasonable alternative for patients who have severe concurrent medical illness.\r"

In 4 patients, a lobar bronchus was also completely obstructed. No mass was visible on chest radiographs of any patient; however, computed tomography in each showed main-stem endobronchial obstruction, lobar obstruction (4 instances in 3 patients), and in 6 patients hypoperfusion of the involved lung. Computed tomographic scan showed additional abnormalities that were unsuspected on viewing chest radiographs or at bronchoscopy, including mediastinal adenopathy in 3 patients and an extraluminal tumor component in 4. After therapy with Nd-YAG laser, main-stem airway diameter increased to a mean of 9.6 mm +/- 1.0 mm (P less than .05) and pulmonary functions improved. Results suggest the complementary role of computed tomography and fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the detection and laser-treatment planning of chest radiographically occult severe neoplastic obstruction of the main-stem bronchus.\r"

All outbreaks have been associated with the consumption of native foods, but in recent years outbreaks have occurred in previously unaffected areas and have involved new food items. Five botulism outbreaks occurred between 1975 and 1985 in an area of southwestern Alaska without previous confirmed outbreaks and among one ethnic group, the Yupik Eskimo. Of the 5 outbreaks, 3 were associated with fermented beaver tail, a nontraditional native food recently introduced into the region. Preparation techniques vary widely within villages and among ethnic groups. Traditional fermentation techniques have changed over the past 50 years; current preparation methods used by some families and ethnic groups may be more favorable for Clostridium botulinum growth. Prevention efforts should be targeted at high-risk subgroups of Alaska Natives who appear to have modified traditional practices and increased their risk of food-borne botulism.\r"

Even with high levels of immunization at kindergarten entry, many toddlers of 7 months and 2 years old remain inadequately immunized. Children immunized solely in the private sector were more adequately immunized than those served by public health clinics; the public-private difference for infants aged 7 months was nearly twofold.\r"

  ".W": "The syndrome of congestive heart failure can result from a variety of cardiac disorders of which left ventricular dysfunction is the most common. The clinical presentation is determined by the interaction between cardiac dysfunction and a series of compensatory mechanisms that are activated throughout the body. Therapy for this disorder is best approached through an understanding of this complex relationship and an appreciation for the influence of preload, afterload, and contractility on cardiac performance. Recent important advances in therapy include the use of combined diuretic therapy, a better understanding of the value of the digitalis glycosides, and evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can relieve symptoms and prolong life. More intensive therapy earlier in the course of congestive heart failure appears to have some clinical benefit. The use of ACE inhibitors during this phase may delay progression of the underlying left ventricular dysfunction. Future therapy will be influenced by the results of ongoing trials that are testing both new agents and expanded indications for drugs that are currently available.\r"

The Departments of Pharmacy and Cardiology retrospectively evaluated the monitoring parameters at this institution. Criteria based on current literature were developed. Twenty-six patients were administered amiodarone, qualifying for entry into the audit. Of these patients, seven were excluded because their medical records were unavailable or incomplete. The 19 eligible patients were hospitalized during initiation of therapy and followed in the Outpatient Cardiology Clinic. The collected data extracted from the medical charts were compared with the following elements of the criteria selected: baseline evaluation prior to the start of therapy; monitoring for signs of pulmonary, hepatic, thyroid, cardiac, ophthalmologic, neurologic, and dermatologic toxicity; and evaluation of potential drug interactions with digoxin and warfarin-type anticoagulants. The percentage of criteria elements appropriately monitored on each patient ranged from 82 to 100 percent, with an average of 91 percent. The most frequently overlooked parameters were warning the patient of a possible photosensitivity reaction, decreasing the digoxin dose if the patient was concurrently taking amiodarone, and performing a slit-lamp examination every six months. Frequent examination of the patient's total organ system and laboratory tests, in addition to patient education, are essential to safe monitoring of amiodarone therapy.\r"

However, at subsequent follow-up evaluations, both treatment groups experienced a significant reduction in disease severity regardless of the baseline differences. No serious safety problems were associated with either investigational therapy. The frequency of reported medical events were distributed equally between the flurbiprofen and diclofenac groups. Although the imbalance in disease severity between treatment groups made a rigorous statistical interpretation of the results very difficult, the data from this clinical trial tend to support the equiefficacy of 50 mg tid regimens of flurbiprofen versus diclofenac for treating osteoarthritis of the knee.\r"

A total of 22 patients were studied, 13 with normal albumin concentration and 9 with low albumin. The mean free phenytoin in the normal albumin group was 9.9 (+/- 1.3) percent and 17.6 (+/- 4.6) percent in the low albumin group. With the groups combined, the mean free phenytoin was 13.1 percent (range 8.3-22.2) with the albumin range of 20-45 g/L. There was a significant negative correlation (r = -0.9, p less than 0.001) between the percentage of free phenytoin and the measured serum albumin. In cancer patients, the serum albumin concentration appears to be the key factor that determines the percentage of free phenytoin. In cancer patients with low serum albumin concentration, the total and free phenytoin concentration should be measured for adequate assessment of phenytoin therapy.\r"

The success of demonstrating the correct technique and the pharmacist's role in patient education has been reported. To obtain information regarding the routine patient education practice of pharmacists when dispensing a beta-agonist MDI (albuterol), the following study was performed. Fifty-two prescriptions for an albuterol MDI were presented to 52 randomly chosen community pharmacists in three Tennessee cities. Twenty-six independent and 26 chain pharmacies wer evaluated. Pharmacists' practice with regard to patient education, instruction, and demonstration of the correct usage of the MDI was observed and recorded. Overall, 13 percent of the pharmacists initially offered to educate the patient-investigator (PI) regarding the correct usage of the MDI without being asked for information. Fifty-three percent of pharmacists offered information only upon being asked specifically how to use the MDI. Of the pharmacists who offered to educate the PI, 71 percent discussed less than half of the eight steps correctly. Only 1 of the 52 pharmacists actually demonstrated MDI inhalation technique, and this in response to a request. No pharmacist asked the PI to perform the technique while he/she observed. No pharmacist offered information on delivery enhancement devices. Our results demonstrate that few pharmacists educate patients on the correct usage of an MDI, and that many pharmacists are not aware of the correct technique.\r"

Hemodynamic evaluation indicated improvements in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and oxygen transport parameters during the period of hemodynamic support, which did not indicate a detrimental effect on perfusion of vital organs and tissues despite the use of this vasoconstrictor. Phenylephrine's pharmacologic properties may represent an advantage for its use as a vasoconstrictor over catecholamines such as norepinephrine and dopamine, particularly in patients who develop tachyarrhythmias with these agents. The pharmacology, dosage, and appropriate monitoring of therapy with phenylephrine in patients with septic shock are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Substance abuse among the elderly is relatively common but often remains undetected or ignored by health and social workers. Psychosocial and health factors related to the aging process are the major contributors to alcoholism and other drug abuse. It is estimated that between two and ten percent of individuals over the age of 60 suffer from alcoholism. This article profiles alcohol and prescription drug abuse among the geriatric clientele of Elderly Services of Spokane (ESS), a division of the Spokane (Washington) Community Mental Health Center. In addition to traditional channels, ESS uses a unique gatekeeper network to identify high-risk, community-based elderly. Elderly persons referred by gatekeepers are regarded as \"hidden\" elderly and at highest risk; notably, 37 percent of ESS clients are referred via this mechanism. Case management records of 1668 ESS clients were reviewed for a history of alcoholism, and a total of 161 persons (9.6 percent) were diagnosed with either primary or secondary alcohol abuse. Fifty subjects (about five percent of the average active ESS caseload) were referred for prescription drug abuse. Misused prescription drug classes were sedative-hypnotics, antianxiety agents, and analgesics. Diazepam, codeine, meprobamate, and flurazepam were the top four agents, and 92 percent of the subjects were found to have a duration of prescription drug abuse in excess of five years. A 60 percent correlation between prescription drug abuse and previous or active alcoholism was found. Additional characteristics of the geriatric study population are discussed in detail, including specific psychosocial factors, source of referral, age, gender, living situation, marital status, psychiatric history, and presence of polypharmacy.\r"

  ".U": "91057892\r", 
  ".W": "Although benzodiazepines have been proven safe and effective for the induction and maintenance of sedation, some instances require the reversal of these events prior to the natural process of metabolism and elimination. Flumazenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is an antagonist that can reduce or terminate benzodiazepine effects in a dose-dependent manner. The antagonist acts by the competitive inhibition of benzodiazepines at their central nervous system receptor sites. When administered intravenously in incremental doses, flumazenil allows for optimal patient response on an individual basis. Despite its short elimination half-life, small doses of flumazenil are usually effective in producing benzodiazepine reversal. Flumazenil's short duration of activity is due to its rapid hepatic metabolism and elimination. Intravenous antagonist doses of 0.2 mg followed by 0.1 mg/min to a total dose of 1 mg have produced significant results in reversing benzodiazepine sedation. As much as 5 mg of flumazenil have been necessary when treating benzodiazepine or mixed-agent intoxications. In such situations, response rarely exceeds a duration of one hour. If resedation occurs, additional doses or an infusion of the antagonist may provide the desired response. Flumazenil is well tolerated locally as well as systemically. Nausea and vomiting occurring after anesthesia is the most documented adverse effect in both placebo and treatment populations. However, there has been no significant difference in the occurrence of vomiting in placebo compared with flumazenil-treated subjects. Careful observation and slow reversal of central nervous system depression is crucial in the avoidance of benzodiazepine withdrawal in those patients dependent upon these agents. Flumazenil appears to provide a mechanism for the safe and effective reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The percentage of patients actually experiencing symptoms that could be attributed to a drug interaction, however, ranged from 0 to 11.1 percent. The relative importance of drug interactions as a clinical problem remains unclear. Screening programs that do more than simply identify large numbers of patients who receive potentially interacting drug combinations without indicating which subpopulations of these individuals are likely to be harmed by the drugs have not yet been developed.\r"

Recognition and management of digitalis toxicity is challenging. Before digoxin immune Fab was commercially available, treatment consisted of managing the signs and symptoms of toxicity until the digitalis was eliminated. Digoxin immune Fab offers a safe, effective, and specific method of quickly reversing digitalis toxicity. Factors that must be considered with the clinical use of this agent include the dosage calculation, administration technique, postdose monitoring, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, interference with commercially available digoxin assays, partial neutralizing dosing, rebound of free digoxin, and indications for use. For severe, life-threatening toxicity, digoxin immune Fab is the treatment of choice.\r"

All patients were monitored preoperatively without alterations to baseline medications. Prospective follow-up was obtained during routine medical care as provided by blinded, independent physicians and by subsequent telephone contact with the patients. Thirty-two patients (18%) had a total of 75 episodes of myocardial ischemia, 73 (97%) of which were asymptomatic. During a mean follow-up period of 615 days, there were 9 cardiac deaths, 1 occurring in-hospital after peripheral vascular surgery, and 13 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 4 occurring in-hospital after peripheral vascular surgery. Cardiac events occurred in 12 of 32 patients with ischemia (38%), including 6 cardiac deaths, and in 10 of 144 patients without ischemia (7%), including 3 cardiac deaths (risk ratio 5.4, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 11.4). The sensitivity of ischemia was 55%, the specificity was 87%, the positive predictive value was 38%, and the negative predictive value was 93%. In a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model controlling for age, gender, coronary risk factors, history of angina, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease and antianginal medications, the presence of ischemia was the only independent predictor of outcome. In patients with peripheral arterial disease, who often are unable to perform adequate exercise testing, ambulatory monitoring for myocardial ischemia is a significant independent predictor of 1- to 2-year prognosis.\r"

Based on angiographic criteria, 69 of 78 patients (88%) with significant CAD had suitable coronary anatomy for CABG. Only 24 patients (31%) had coronary anatomy amenable to PTCA. CABG was performed in 19 patients with an operative mortality of 16% and major complication rate of 37%. PTCA was performed in 12 patients with a clinical success rate of 83%, mortality of 8% and major complication rate of 8%. It is concluded that in octogenarians with CAD, cardiac catheterization will often reveal coronary anatomy that is suitable for CABG but less suitable for PTCA. The morbidity and mortality associated with these interventions are high.\r"

  ".W": "There is little information concerning the prevalence and clinical correlates of increased pulmonary thallium-201 uptake during dipyridamole thallium-201 stress imaging. Accordingly, the clinical characteristics and quantitative thallium-201 findings were correlated with quantitative lung/heart thallium-201 ratio in 87 patients undergoing dipyridamole thallium-201 stress testing. Nineteen patients (22%) had an elevated ratio (greater than 0.51). These patients were more likely to have had an infarction, to be taking beta blockers, and have a lower rate-pressure product after dipyridamole administration than those with a normal ratio (p less than 0.03). An elevated ratio was associated with a greater likelihood of initial, redistribution and persistent defects, as well as left ventricular cavity dilatation on thallium-201 imaging (p less than 0.05). In addition, the number of myocardial segments demonstrating initial, redistribution and persistent defects was also greater in patients with increased ratios (p less than 0.03). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of redistribution and left ventricular cavity dilatation were the most significant correlates of lung/heart thallium-201 ratio. It is concluded that the prevalence of increased lung/heart thallium-201 ratio with dipyridamole thallium-201 stress imaging is similar to that seen with exercise stress imaging. As with exercise thallium-201 imaging, increased pulmonary thallium-201 uptake may be a marker of functionally more significant coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "The extent to which lipolysis is attenuated during prolonged submaximal exercise during beta blockade was determined in 12 normotensive endurance-trained and 12 hypertensive sedentary men using nonselective drugs with and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Initially, subjects performed a graded treadmill test to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). This was followed by 2-hour walks at 25 and 45% of the subject's VO2max under each of 3 treatments: pindolol (ISA), propranolol (non-ISA) and placebo. The distribution of medication was randomized and double blinded. Blood samples taken at rest and every 30 minutes during the 2-hour walks were analyzed to determine the concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol. On the basis of the respective changes in FFA, glycerols and the respiratory exchange ratio, beta-adrenergic blockade did not attenuate lipolysis in the untrained hypertensive subjects when compared with the placebo administration. However, beta blockade did demonstrate a tendency to attenuate lipolysis in the trained, normotensive subjects when compared with results after placebo administration. This was particularly evident at 30 minutes of exercise, when both glycerol and FFA concentrations were not increased above resting values under both conditions of beta blockade. No differences between pindolol and propranolol were observed. Therefore, a beta-blocking agent with ISA properties appears to have no clear benefit with respect to lipid metabolism during low and moderate intensity exercise. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that beta blockade does not inhibit exercise-induced lipolysis at low and moderate intensities of exercise as formerly believed, and is unlikely to be the cause of fatigue normally observed during work in patient populations taking beta-blocking medication.\r"

With an unrestricted sodium diet, plasma renin concentration was inhibited within 10 minutes by intravenous enalkiren and remained essentially undetectable for greater than or equal to 6 hours (11.9 +/- 4 to 1.0 +/- 0.6 ng angiotensin I/ml/hour, p less than 0.05). Mean arterial blood pressure declined gradually (108 +/- 5 to 84 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = 0.02), as did plasma aldosterone concentration (14.4 +/- 3.8 to 4.4 +/- 0.8 ng/dl, p = 0.03), whereas plasma immunoreactive active renin concentration increased progressively (35 +/- 14 to 160 +/- 60 pg/ml, p greater than 0.05). Urinary excretion of the stable metabolite of prostacyclin (6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha) decreased slightly, but not significantly (42 +/- 10 to 33 +/- 11 ng/g creatinine, p = 0.13). The addition of a diuretic decreased baseline blood pressure and increased baseline plasma renin and aldosterone values. Blood pressure responses to enalkiren were slightly (though not significantly) greater than those observed before diuretic administration. We conclude that enalkiren is effective in decreasing blood pressure and in inhibiting the renin system, without significantly altering urinary prostacyclin excretion, in patients with essential hypertension. These results suggest that the renin system contributes to the maintenance of elevated blood pressure in some patients with essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "To identify patients with left ventricular ejection fractions less than 20% who are likely to survive on tailored medical therapy after referral to transplantation, this study of 152 patients addressed the hypotheses that (1) severely elevated filling pressures initially measured at referral would not necessarily predict poor outcome, (2) survival would be best when low pulmonary wedge pressures could be achieved with therapy tailored for hemodynamic goals, and (3) coronary artery disease would be an independent risk factor for early mortality. Despite an average initial ejection fraction of 0.15, cardiac index of 2.0 liters/min/m2 and pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 28 mm Hg, the actuarial survival with tailored therapy was 63% at 1 year, with 34 of 41 (83%) deaths occurring suddenly. Survival was not related to initial filling pressure elevation, but was best predicted by the pulmonary artery wedge pressures during therapy; patients achieving pressure of less than or equal to 16 mm Hg had 1-year survival of 83 vs 38% (p = 0.0001). The other independent predictors were serum sodium and coronary artery disease. Patients with high filling pressures during therapy and coronary artery disease had 21% survival at 1 year. Survival after referral to transplantation with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 20% is better than previously described. Patients in whom left ventricular filling pressures cannot be adequately reduced by tailored therapy, particularly if coronary artery disease is present, should be considered for early transplantation.\r"

Although echocardiography with Doppler study enables characterization of the mitral valve apparatus and quantification of regurgitation, its use has resulted in an overemphasis of the technical diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse and an undervaluation of diagnosis based on physical examination. To determine the clinical significance of an auscultatory classification of mitral systolic clicks with or without precordial systolic murmurs, 1 consultant's medical records of 291 patients with these signs were reviewed. Based on initial auscultatory findings, patients were divided into: (1) single or multiple apical systolic clicks with no murmur (n = 99); (2) single or multiple apical systolic clicks and a late systolic murmur (n = 129); and (3) single or multiple apical clicks and an apical pansystolic murmur or murmur beginning in the first half of systole (n = 63). The average duration of patient follow-up was 8 years (range 1 to 30). The prognosis was excellent for patients from all 3 classes. Two cardiac-related deaths occurred: 1 each from classes 1 and 2. Mitral valve surgery was performed in 3 class 2 patients (2%) and in 2 class 3 patients (3%). No patients developed endocarditis during follow-up. Palpitations, with varying anxiety overlay, constituted a major indication for cardiologic referral in all 3 classes. Auscultatory findings were valuable to the physician for explanation and relief of patient anxiety. For patient management, use of an auscultatory classification may be preferable to the technically generated term \"mitral valve prolapse.\"\r"

Obscuring random noise, it allows the detection of low-amplitude wave forms in the terminal portion of the QRS complex, also known as ventricular late potentials. A higher incidence of arrhythmic events has been found in patients with abnormal ventricular late potentials after an acute myocardial infarction. Few studies have been conducted in healthy subjects to assess normal values. Sixty-one healthy subjects were enrolled in our study (33 men and 28 women). The results (mean +/- standard deviation) are as follows: duration of the filtered QRS (QRS duration) was 95 +/- 10 ms; duration of the low-amplitude signals in the terminal portion of QRS less than 40 microV (LAS less than 40) was 32 +/- 8 ms; and root-mean-square voltage in the last 40 ms (RMS - 40) was 33 +/- 16 microV. A significant difference was noted in QRS duration between men and women (98 +/- 11 vs 92 +/- 6 ms, p = 0.006); no difference was found in LAS less than 40 (31 +/- 8 vs 34 +/- 8 ms) and in RMS-40 (36 +/- 17 vs 30 +/- 13 microV). QRS duration confidence limits of 95% were less than or equal to 114 ms for the total group, less than or equal to 120 ms for men and less than or equal to 104 ms for women. Normalization of QRS duration for height (normal value less than 66 ms/m) eliminated any difference between men and women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients were five black and three white women, 56-87 years of age. The FNA specimen was cyst fluid in four cases (bloody in three, clear in one). All the aspirates showed cellular smears with small and large clusters of cells with papillary and/or cribriform configurations and numerous single epithelial cells. The cells were cuboidal to columnar with minimal atypia. ICPC was suggested by FNA in each case, and all the patients underwent surgical excision or mastectomy. Flow cytometry, performed on fresh FNA specimen in one case and on paraffin-embedded surgical tissue in all eight cases, showed seven tumors to be aneuploid and one to be diploid. The authors contend that ICPCs of breast have distinct cytomorphologic features that can be recognized by FNA. Because ICPC may present in cyst fluid, either bloody or clear, all breast cyst fluids from postmenopausal women should be examined cytologically. Flow cytometric demonstration of an aneuploid population may assist in confirming malignancy in this lesion.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study of 148 consecutive breast adenocarcinomas, proliferative indices of the same surgical tumor sample were performed by immunohistologic staining (Ki67 index) with the use of the Ki67 monoclonal antibody, which binds to a nuclear antigen only expressed in cycling cells, and by flow cytometry-derived S-phase fraction (SPF). Measurable Ki67 and SPF indices were obtained in 142 cases and 99 cases, respectively, and in 96 cases by both methods. In aneuploid tumors, a significant but low (P less than 0.05, r = 0.3) relationship was observed between Ki67 index and SPF. When compared with clinical, pathologic, and biochemical parameters these two proliferative indices were shown to be associated with nuclear grading and mitotic index. Additionally, correlations were observed between Ki67 index and node involvement (P less than 0.02) and between SPF and estrogen receptors (P = 0.002). These results show that (1) proliferative indices are obtained in 96% of surgical samples with Ki67 versus 67% with SPF and that (2) Ki67 index and SPF may provide complementary data with respect to prognosis.\r"

It is characterized by trabecular and/or alveolar growth patterns, merging with follicular areas, and by the absence of pleomorphism in the tumor cells. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) materials (both smears and cell-block preparations) from six patients were reviewed after the diagnosis of IC was confirmed on the surgical specimen. The following cytologic features were consistently found: high cellularity and necrotic background; low grade of atypia; trabeculae and/or clusters, possibly associated with microfollicles, of cells with poorly defined cytoplasm; and cytoplasmic vacuoles containing thyroglobulin. Nuclear inclusions and grooving of the nuclear surface were additional features. Preoperative diagnosis suggestive of IC might be of value for planning surgical treatment and subsequent therapy.\r"

At the time of biopsy, diagrams of the palpated organ were drawn, depicting the location of the lesion and the site of each biopsy. Without the examiners' knowledge of cytologic data, extirpated prostate glands were examined with whole organ histologic sections, and carcinomas were scored according to the method of Gleason. The location and extent of all typical and malignant foci were mapped on a standard diagram. The results of preoperative cytologic examination were compared with postoperative histopathologic findings, showing a tendency toward underestimation of both the extent and degree of differentiation of the carcinomas during cytologic examination. In no case were these parameters overestimated during cytologic examination. The Gleason score correlated well with the presence of capsular and seminal vesicle invasion.\r"

  ".W": "One of the great challenges in the cytodiagnosis of effusions is the distinction between reactive mesothelium/histiocytes and cancer cells. This is notably true in patients having undergone radiation and/or chemotherapy. To establish whether monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) could be used as reliable diagnostic adjuvants, the authors retrospectively and blindly studied 60 cases diagnosed by standard cytologic criteria (malignant, benign, and equivocal), with a panel of seven readily available MoAbs (cytokeratins, vimentin, EMA, B72.3, alpha-CEA, HMFG-2, and Leu-M1) and the lectin Ulex europaeus I. All 18 (100%) malignant cases showed reactivity with EMA and HMFG, whereas 17 (95%) and 11 (61%) reacted with B72.3 and alpha-CEA, respectively. Combinations of (1) EMA + B72.3, (2) EMA + alpha-CEA, and (3) EMA + alpha-CEA + B72.3 displayed positivity in 17 (95%), 11 (61%), and 10 (56%) malignant cases, respectively. Of the 18 benign cases, 7 reacted with HMFG and 2 each with EMA and B72.3. Only one case (5.5%) reacted with both EMA and B72.3. Based on these results, the 24 equivocal cases were regrouped into 14 malignant and 10 benign cases. Follow-up effusions obtained within the ensuing three months in all these patients allowed the authors to unequivocally confirm the diagnosis in all but five. The combination of EMA and B72.3 MoAbs detected malignant cells in 95% of the cases, with a 3.5% incidence of false positive cases in this study. A panel of EMA, B72.3, and alpha-CEA MoAbs should prove the most useful and simple approach to the correct diagnosis in most questionable effusions. Some of the potential pitfalls are discussed.\r"

Workup revealed a left breast mass, which on biopsy showed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma with neoplastic cells that were cytologically similar to those found within the cyst contents. Four other pseudocysts are described with variable numbers of intracystic vascular structures and benign adrenal cortical cells. In addition, intracystic mature adipose tissue was observed in all four cases, with myelolipomatous metaplasia found in one. Awareness of the wide histologic variability of these lesions should improve diagnostic accuracy and allow distinction from adrenocortical neoplasia and myelolipoma.\r"

The authors now report three patients with a distinctly different lymphoproliferative syndrome. Two patients with common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) (CD10)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one patient with acute myelogenous leukemia, respectively, received high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by marrow transplantation from either an HLA-identical sibling or HLA-mismatched parent. All three patients developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), requiring immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids. A secondary malignant T-cell lymphoproliferation occurred 2, 21, and 43 months, respectively, after marrow transplantation. In all three cases the lymphoid cells expressed T-cell surface antigens and were morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct from the malignant cells present before transplantation. One tumor was of host cell origin, one was probably of donor origin, and the tumor origin in the third case could not be determined. The authors were unable to find any evidence for EBV, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I or II, human immunodeficiency virus, or human herpesvirus 6.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody, termed Ki-M6 (CD68), which shows a restricted reactivity to cells of the monocyte/macrophage system, has been evaluated primarily with the use of cryostat sections. In this study the authors could assess that the Ki-M6 antibody recognizes a fixation-resistant epitope in most human macrophages. The Ki-M6 immunoreactivity with monocyte/macrophage-related cells was established by testing on routinely processed samples of reactive and neoplastic lymphoid tissues; it was compared with the staining for vimentin (V9) and S-100 protein antibodies, with visualization of the stationary elements of lymphoid tissues, with the aim of establishing its value in the study of the nonlymphoid microenvironment. The Ki-M6 antibody reactivity could be achieved with Bouin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, without any proteolytic treatment, with the use of the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method, especially after overnight incubation time at 4 degrees C. Some reduction in antigenic reactivity was observed in B5- or formaldehyde-fixed samples. The antibody reacted with macrophages of all different lymph node compartments; a broad reactivity against cells of macrophage lineage, including multinucleated giant cells, was observed in epithelioid granulomas. Ki-M6-positive cells other than classic macrophages were the so-called \"plasmacytoid T-cells\" and cells displaying elongated cytoplasms with fibroblastic-like features. Granulocytes, follicular dendritic reticulum cells, and interdigitating reticulum cells did not reveal any reactivity with Ki-M6 antibody. In malignant lesions, neoplastic cells of follicular and diffuse B- and T-cell lymphomas, including large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin's disease were negative in all cases studied. This study shows that Ki-M6 seems to be another anti-macrophage-specific antibody that reacts, in routinely processed tissue sections, with tissue macrophages but not with accessory cells. Thus, it may be a valuable addition to vimentin and S-100 protein antibodies for investigation of the microenvironmental organization of lymphoid tissues both in normal and neoplastic conditions.\r"

In this article the author analyzes those data with respect to detection of false negative cytology screening errors, specimen sampling errors, precision in cytology and biopsy interpretation, and productivity of quality assurance methods. Sampling errors in obtaining cytology specimens are a major problem to be addressed by cytology quality assurance. The most sensitive and efficient method for detection of false negative cytologic results in this laboratory was rescreening of previous negative Papanicolaou's (Pap) smears in patients presenting for the first time with an abnormal Pap smear. Data indicate that the currently mandated requirement for rescreening 10% of a laboratory's negative Pap smears should be reconsidered and rescinded in certain circumstances.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the increasing reliance on breakpoint cluster region (bcr) determinations in diagnosis of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), few reports have dealt with the practical aspects of specimen analysis. In the setting of a routine molecular diagnostics laboratory, samples from 68 patients with active CML were evaluated for bcr rearrangements, with the use of a variety of enzymes and two probes. The data have been used to develop an efficient strategy for bcr screening and breakpoint determination. Screening with the universal bcr (UBCR) probe on Xba I and BgI II digests yielded bcr rearrangements in 100% of the Ph1-positive patients and three of the seven Ph1-negative patients, giving bcr analysis a sensitivity of 100%. A single-enzyme screen using the UBCR probe would have resulted in a false negative rate of 10%. The false negative rate was determined during the breakpoint site analysis from additional digests hybridized to both the 3' and UBCR probes. The false negative rate for the 3' probe was 26.5%, because of deletions or 5' rearrangements. The method of breakpoint site determination was dependent on screening results. In 78% of cases, one additional hybridization with two enzyme digests was required. During breakpoint site analysis, a rare false negative result was also demonstrated with Bam HI and Eco RI. This screening strategy has made bcr analysis competitive with cytogenetic analysis at the authors' institution; although turnaround time may be slightly longer, bcr analysis can yield information (such as detecting bcr-positive/Ph1-negative patients and determining breakpoint site) that cannot be obtained by cytogenetics.\r"

  ".W": "Smoking rates in the United States have decreased since 1963, but this trend is less apparent in adolescents, especially girls. Using data on birth certificates from 1984 through 1988, we analyzed smoking trends during pregnancy in teenagers in Washington State. There was a small but significant increase in the overall smoking prevalence during pregnancy between 1984 (32%) and 1988 (37%). Smoking rates varied by mother's age, race and ethnicity, marital status, and prenatal care. Whites had the highest smoking prevalence, and native Americans showed the largest increase in smoking prevalence over time. In the 5 years studied, unmarried pregnant teenagers had a smoking prevalence of 42.8%, compared with a rate of 31.7% in married teenagers. Compared with other studies of smoking rates in nonpregnant teenagers, pregnant teenagers in Washington State had a much higher smoking prevalence than their nonpregnant peers, and the differences between these two groups did not appear to diminish over time. This study suggests that there is little movement toward meeting the 1990 Health Objectives for the Nation regarding smoking in Washington State teenagers who become pregnant.\r"

Endotracheal tube size was changed to account for growth and varied from 2.5 to 4.0 mm. These infants developed features of midfacial hypoplasia, namely, depressed nasal bridge, small-tipped nose, long philtrum, underdeveloped malar areas, and carplike mouth. These features have not been associated with long-term intubation in premature infants. We suggest that features of prolonged nasotracheal intubation, such as direct compression by the tube and the method of tube fixation, decreased air flow through the developing nares and sinuses and reduced faciomuscular activity, resulting in the observed midfacial hypoplasia. The degree to which growth corrects these deformations is unknown.\r"

The patients were reviewed to assess the incidence of infection with cytomegalovirus, the severity of disease, and the relationship of recipient and donor serostatus to cytomegalovirus disease. Overall, the incidence of infection was 54% (14/26). Over 90% of patients who were seropositive or whose donors were seropositive developed evidence of cytomegalovirus infection after transplantation. Forty-three percent (6/14) of those with cytomegalovirus infections developed severe, fatal cytomegalovirus disease, despite treatment with immunoglobulins and ganciclovir (Syntex Laboratories Inc, Palo Alto, Calif) or foscarnet sodium (Astra, Pharmaceutical Products Inc, Westborough, Mass). Of all posttransplant deaths, two thirds were associated with severe cytomegalovirus infection. Cytomegalovirus-related deaths occurred in three of four seronegative patients with seropositive donors and three of six seropositive patients with seropositive donors. Therefore, a seropositive donor appeared to be a major risk factor for severe cytomegalovirus disease.\r"

Seventy-three children with impetigo were randomly assigned to receive penicillin V potassium or cephalexin monohydrate, both administered in dosages of 40 to 50 mg/kg per day, or erythromycin estolate administered in a dosage of 30 to 40 mg/kg per day. All drugs were given in three divided doses for 10 days. Treatment failure was defined as persistence of lesions 8 to 10 days after initiation of drug therapy as determined by examiners blinded to the treatment therapies. Forty-five (62%) cultures showed Staphylococcus aureus only, 14 (19%) showed S aureus and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, six (8%) showed group A beta-hemolytic streptococci only, and eight (11%) showed no growth or other organisms. Treatment failure occurred in six (24%) of 25 patients treated with penicillin V, one (4%) of 25 patients treated with erythromycin estolate, and no patients treated with cephalexin. We conclude that S aureus is the most common cause of impetigo in children in our study population, that cephalexin is the most effective treatment, that erythromycin estolate is nearly equally effective and may be preferred on a cost-effectiveness basis, and that penicillin V is inadequate for treatment of this infection.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging findings were abnormal in 33% of the patients, with no increased frequency of right hemispheric lesions. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated good intracranial flow in all infants and demonstrable right internal carotid arterial flow in 35% of those patients with permanent carotid ligation. An abnormal magnetic resonance imaging study was found more often in infants with abnormal predischarge neurologic examination results. These techniques have several advantages over other neuroimaging modalities, including better definition of deep structures, myelin formation, and intracranial vasculature, the absence of bone artifact, and the elimination of catheter or contrast use.\r"

Results show that at entry, obese children are taller than their nonobese peers (74th percentile), and that even after 5 years, they remain taller than the norm (65th percentile). Child weight and level of physical maturity accounted for 54% of the variance in predicting baseline height percentile. Entrance height and parental height accounted for 9% of the variance in changes in height percentile, both adjusted for parental height. Weight change did not correlate with growth adjusted for parental height. These results do not suggest that negative effects on height are a long-term side effect of child weight control.\r"

No differences between groups were noted on neurologic examination results or on the Bayley Mental Developmental Index; however, one infected infant had a severely delayed Bayley Psychomotor Developmental Index score. In addition, the mean Mental Developmental Index score of the four infected infants with diffuse periventricular radiolucencies was significantly below that of the remaining infected infants (93 +/- 8 vs 109 +/- 13).

They also review the different hypotheses on the psychopathogenesis of the deja vu experience and introduce an explanation based on the hologram as a mnestic model.\r"

These definitions have been used by 13 authors to formulate service programs and to estimate the prevalence of serious mental illness in the population. To test the applicability of these definitions, the authors operationalized each definition and applied it to a representative sample of 222 patients receiving services in one of Philadelphia's inner-city neighborhoods. The analysis showed estimates of prevalence of serious mental illness ranging from 4% to 88% of the treated population, depending on the definition applied. The NIMH (1987) definition was representative of the middle-range estimates of 45% to 55% arrived at by eight authors.\r"

Twenty autistic (according to DSM-III-R criteria) and 13 mentally retarded (nonverbal IQ less than 75) subjects were assessed. Eighty percent of the autistic subjects had abnormal interpeak latencies, compared to 15% of the mentally retarded subjects. The I-V and III-V prolonged interpeak latency values were seen only in the autistic subjects. The ipsilateral masking procedure doubled the rate of detection of higher-brainstem abnormalities in the autistic children.\r"

The rarity and diversity of these 12 diseases make it highly unlikely that they randomly occurred with autism.

Placebo response was more likely to be maintained in patients who were currently married. At the end of 3 months, the overall relapse rate was 58%.

The authors conclude that although the rates of psychotropic prescriptions are an important entry point for concerns about quality and appropriateness of psychotropic administration to older nursing home residents, longitudinal studies including the prescribing pattern, indications, and efficacy are needed to determine more clinically meaningful indicators of quality care.\r"

All three agents demonstrated modest but significant efficacy as measured by clinician ratings of agitated behavior and activities of daily living. The absolute magnitude of improvement was greater for haloperidol and diphenhydramine than for oxazepam, but differences among groups did not approach statistical significance. Frequencies of acute adverse events during the trial were similar across the drug treatment groups. Although these drugs may differ in terms of long-term safety and efficacy, they appear to be equivalent for short-term management of agitated behavior in severely demented patients.\r"

Performance was markedly impaired under each condition. A second cohort (N = 12) was tested after receiving instructions plus rehearsal and feedback. These subjects' performance was comparable to nonpatient norms and was maintained on a subsequent day.

Increase of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase levels as high as 2100 IU; prolongation of prothrombin time; elevation of serum bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and potassium levels; decrease in urinary sodium excretion; and a normal urinary sediment are the salient laboratory abnormalities of this entity. Treated with conventional medication, the patients' course was fatal in 4 cases. When the splanchnic vasodilator dopamine was added to the patients' management, 5 of 9 patients recovered. Cardiogenic hepatorenal syndrome is a severe but potentially reversible complication of heart failure. The apparently beneficial effect of low-dose dopamine needs further evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of atherosclerotic lesions by the ultrasonography has presented several problems, above all, the determination of accuracy and reproducibility of this methodology in humans. The present study aims to evaluated the results of B-mode imaging of extracranial carotid arteries in patients selected for surgery as compared with histologic results of the observations of the samples obtained by endarterectomy. Shrinkage effects of the histologic samples were taken into consideration. Several bidimensional images of atherosclerotic lesions, as obtained by ultrasound at different incident angles, were used to establish their maximum thickness. The maximum degree of the vessel stenosis calculated by ultrasound showed a high correlation (Y = 0.47X + 42.4, se = 0.11, r = 0.5, p less than 0.001) compared with the one obtained by histology. The imaging methodology provided however, a mean overestimation of the stenosis of about 7%. Relationships among the amount of calcium (p less than 0.03); necrotic core p less than 0.056); and echogenic types, ie, soft, mixed, and hard; have been suggested by a statistical trend. The results suggested that of the vascular lumen due to advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Qualitative interpretation of atherosclerosis by B-mode imaging, ie, morphologic characteristics, seem, at present, to be of value, but more investigations in depth are needed.\r"

In a large percentage of cases it is caused by stenotic/thrombotic processes in carotid arteries and this emphasizes the importance of the problem of early diagnosis and treatment of carotid pathology. Recently Doppler sonography has become a leading non-invasive method of early screening of stenotic processes in carotid arteries. The aim of the present study was to ascertain the diagnostic abilities of Doppler sonography for screening of carotid pathology, assessment of extra-cranial and intracranial hemodynamics, defining of indications, and control of vascular reconstructions of carotids.\r"

  ".U": "91058272\r", 
  ".W": "Sixty consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography and left ventriculography from six to eight weeks after the onset of definite inferior myocardial infarction were divided into three groups according to the polarity of U waves in (1) leads II, III, a VF and (2) in leads V4 to V6 (positive = Group P, flat or isoelectric = Group F, and negative = Group N). The following parameters were analyzed: (1) ECG score; (2) global ejection fraction: (3) regional area change: (4) number of asynergic, and akinetic segmental radii; (5) number of asynergic and akinetic areas: and (6) number of diseased coronary arteries and the incidence of left anterior descending artery (LAD) disease. There were no significant differences among the three groups according to the polarity of U waves in two subgroups by the site of U waves in age, gender, systemic blood pressure, and ECG scores. The polarity of U waves in leads II.III.a VF (subgroup 1) correlated with the size of myocardial infarction; regional area changes in inferior segment (Area 2) were 64.1 +/- 8.2 in group P1, 31.8 +/- 14.7 in group F1, and 21.0 +/- 15.8 in group N1 (p less than 0.01, F = 32.8). The polarity of U waves in leads V4-6 (subgroup2) correlated with anterolateral wall motion; regional area changes in anterolateral segments (Area 5) were 76.8 +/- 11.6 in group P, 66.5 +/- 18.5 in group F, and 48.9 +/- 17.1 in group N (p less than 0.01, F = 18.6). The incidence of multivessel disease increased from group P2 (36.4%), to group F2 (54.5%), to group N2 (75.0%), and the incidence of LAD disease increased from 27.3%, to 45.5%, to 68.8%, respectively. A negative U wave in either location suggested severely decreased apical wall motion, and there was a tendency for global ejection fractions to decrease in the following order: group P, group F, and group N. From these results, the authors conclude that the polarity of U waves may be one of the parameters correlating with the wall motion and left ventricular function in prior inferior myocardial infarction.\r"

The authors performed aortic valve balloon dilatation on 10 closed-chest dogs with normal aortic valves, using a femoral cutdown approach and fluoroscopic guidance. Four were done with a single 15 mm balloon catheter, and in the other 6 two 12 mm balloon catheters were used. Balloons were inflated to 5 to 12 atms pressure with contrast solution. After several inflations the dogs were sacrificed, the hearts removed and examined. Gross examinations revealed subendocardial hemorrhage in the outflow tract in 5 of the 6 in which double balloons had been used. Microscopically, all aortic valve areas showed hemorrhage, mostly in loose connective tissues of the valve leaflets. The severity of injury appeared greater when two balloons had been used. Histologic examination showed definite injury to the myocytes of the left bundle branch in all 6 of the double-ballooned dogs, but in none of those subjected to the single-balloon procedure. During aortic valve dilation the only manifestation of conduction system injury was prolongation of the QRS complex in 3 of the 6 dogs in which a double-balloon catheter had been used. The results suggest that electrocardiographic conduction disturbances observed in patients undergoing aortic valvuloplasty may be the result of direct injury of conduction tissue and may be more likely to occur when larger balloons are used.\r"

However, catheter problems with external implanted devices have resulted in limited application of chemotherapy. The introduction of subcutaneous devices offers an opportunity for long-term locoregional chemotherapy. Twelve external intraarterial catheters were implanted into 12 patients and 52 subcutaneously placed devices into 51 patients, all with various hepatic malignancies. Retrospective analyses comparing those two intraarterial systems were conducted taking into account the function and complication rate (hepatic artery thrombosis, infection, leaking, hemorrhage, and dislocation). The follow-up time for the external system was two to eight months (median five weeks), the thrombosis rate 33.3%, and the infection rate 25%. One instance of severe bleeding from the hepatic artery occurred during chemotherapy. One catheter dislocated. For the subcutaneously implanted intraarterial devices the follow-up time was five to forty-one months (median sixteen months), the thrombotic complication rate 17.3%, and the infection rate 7.6% (all patients with simultaneous bowel surgery). Catheter dislocation one year later required reimplantation; in 1 patient therapy had to be discontinued because of a catheter leak. The overall function rate was 71.3% with a median follow-up time of eight months. Anticoagulation therapy for subcutaneously implanted devices starting from the beginning of intraarterial chemotherapy is recommended to achieve long-term patency. No implantation should be preformed simultaneously with bowel surgery. The subcutaneously placed intraarterial devices had a higher function rate and were available for a longer period as compared with external implanted catheters.\r"

They examined the bronchioles at weekly interfals up to three and a half months. On the week chosen each dog was anesthetized, totally heparinized, and exsanguino-perfused with saline. Just after heart arrest, the thoracic aorta was injected with a barium solution until this white medium appeared in the bronchial arteries. The heart-lung blocs were excised en bloc, submitted to soft-tissue x ray, fixed, and then sliced to 1 cm. Corresponding right and left 5-mm-thick samples of these slices were prepared for contact microradiography followed by histologic 5-to-20-micron-thick, stained, correlated specimens. For two weeks the left bronchial arteries remained empty, but there was no necrosis or edema. Between two and four weeks barium solution appeared in the bronchial arteries, and the bronchiolar epithelium had become multistratified. Later the left bronchiangiogram became similar to the right, but there were more folds of the mucosa and a little submucosal fibrosis. These studies provide proof that no significant ischemic lesions occurred during repermeation of the bronchiolar vascular bed. Ischemia, if existent, is not a significant factor in obliterative bronchiolitis.\r"

Although its incidence is rare, its occurrence is being increasingly recognized and has been the subject of a growing number of cases reports in recent years. This study adds 2 more cases to the file. Both cases involved young women with the characteristic symptoms of dyspnea, cough, abdominal discomfort and swelling, chest pain, and hemoptysis, with abundant formation of refractory chylous, serous ascites. Although the progression of the disease differed in each case, pulmonary function was affected in a similar way by the presence of obstructive and restrictive defects and a decrease in diffusing capacity. Underlying abnormalities were dilated lymphatics, thickened lymphatic walls, and muscular proliferation of leiomyomatous origin, leading to bronchial restriction. The authors point to the subtlety required in arriving at a differentiated diagnosis of lymphangiomyomatosis lymphangioleiomyomatosis and the difference between the two conditions. They also make particular recommendations in respect to the importance of preliminary hormone receptor tests and to the wisdom to be exercised in ligating a main lymphatic duct in the chest to control the formation of ascites. Pneumothorax, a frequent manifestation of lymphangiomyomatosis, is found to be the result of chronic air trapping due to a combination of narrowing of conducting airways and disruption of normal lung parenchyma.\r"

We report here the case of a patient presenting with a Glanzmann thrombasthenia defined by the complete lack of platelet aggregation, and showing a typical RP which was confirmed by the measurement of hand temperature and the decrease of digital and hand blood flow. Thus, the description of this case shows that platelet aggregation by itself is not necessary for the occurrence of RP, and encourages for therapeutic purposes the development of vasodilatators rather than platelet antiaggregants agents.\"\r"

The diagnosis of laryngeal disorders requires a thorough understanding of the normal function of the laryngeal anatomy and physiology. Some patients with asthma may have a component of their airway obstruction in the larynx and large airways. Paradoxical vocal cord motion occurs when the true vocal cords approximate during inspiration, and although severe subjective dyspnea may occur, in most cases there is no evidence of hypoxia, hemoglobin desaturation, or an abnormality of the arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient. Provocative tests with methacholine are negative in this group of patients. Patients with PVCM are usually female and may have an affiliation with the medical profession. Many have psychologic difficulties, and the foundation of treatment is speech therapy and psychotherapy if indicated. Other disorders that may produce dyspnea from laryngeal dysfunction include Meige syndrome, abductor spastic dysphonia, and laryngospasm. Recognition of these disorders will expedite timely, accurate diagnosis and treatment.\r"

The average age of onset was 4 years 2 months. Sex ratio (M:F) was 3.6:1. A positive skin test is essential for the diagnosis. Conjunctival provocation tests were performed in 80% of cases because of reliability, safety, and convenience. The first symptom appeared an average of 10 months after initial exposure to silk. In 61% of patients, asthma was accompanied by allergic rhinitis but in only 14% of cases by conjunctivitis. In most cases, asthma occurred in winter, due to seasonal use of bed quilts or clothes filled with silk. Silk is a highly potent allergen. The average mean wheal diameter elicited by silk in prick testing was larger than two histamine equivalent prick tests. A cross reactivity exists among mulberry silk, and silkworm cocoons, batryticated silkworms, and silkworm chrysalis.\r"

There was a statistically significant correlation between values of the PaO2 before and after inhalation (P less than .05).\r"

Pollen grains are present in the air from February to July, with a maximum in May. Urticaceae and Cupressaceae were the major contributors to the total pollen airspora, followed by Graminaceae, Oleaceae, Pinaceae, Cheno-Amaranthaceae, and Fagaceae. Fungal spores showed two periods of high sporulation, from April to June and in September-October, and two marked decreases, during winter and August. Cladosporium was by far the most abundant spore identified, followed by Basidiomycetes, Alternaria, and Fusarium.\r"

  ".W": "To study the possible efficacy of ketotifen (K) in the treatment of idiopathic anaphylaxis (IA), K was administered in an open-label trial to six patients with IA who required corticosteroids at doses below which their disease could not be controlled. During the study, patients continued to receive noncorticosteroid medications (eg, antihistamines, oral adrenergic agents) that had been used on a regular basis for treatment of IA before study, but periodic attempts to reduce corticosteroid doses were made. A reduction of prednisone dose with continued control of disease was judged to be evidence for a beneficial effect of K. After 7 to 16 months of K administration, three patients were judged to have had probable benefits from K (reductions in alternate day prednisone dose requirement from 40 mg to none, 35 mg to 15 mg, and 30 mg to none), and one patient had a possible benefit from K (dose reduction from 100 to 120 mg to 77 mg). Two other patients were unable to tolerate major decreases in prednisone without developing symptoms or signs of IA. Within the limitations of this study design, we conclude that K may be efficacious in the treatment of some patients with IA, and that further trials of K in the treatment of IA are indicated.\r"

Among the early postoperative complications of an IOL in the AC the authors noticed striate keratopathy and uveal flare and postoperative transitory ocular hypertension and striate keratitis with an IOL in the PC. Moreover, in late postoperative complications in AC implantation they observed: cystoid macular edema, bullous keratitis, retinal detachment, late uveitis, opacification of posterior capsule, eccentric displacement of the IOL, and less frequently, cystoid macular edema in PC implantations. The authors prefer IOL implantation in the PC after extracapsular cataract extraction, since this surgery causes less problems in the cornea, vitreous, and retina.\r"

The 30-degree probe was less likely to strike the lens inadvertently, produced a more consistent burn, was more versatile in posterior treatments, and had a longer fiberoptic core life than the 45-degree probe. It was impossible to treat the peripheral retina using the straight probe without hitting the lens during phakic pars plana vitrectomy.\r"
