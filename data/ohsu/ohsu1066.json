We report a 72-yr-old woman with pernicious anemia who was found to have GAVE associated with adenosquamous carcinoma of the gastric cardia and adenocarcinoma in situ of the pylorus. In view of recent reports of the use of endoscopic modalities rather than surgical resection to treat GAVE, our case alerts endoscopists to the possibility of coexisting carcinoma.\r"

In general, a single therapeutic agent can be expected to provide an adequate blood pressure response in 40% to 60% of hypertensive patients. The addition of a second agent usually extends the response rate to over 85%. The addition of a diuretic to nondiuretic regimens often produces an additive blood pressure-lowering effect. However, calcium channel entry blockers (CCBs) may be an exception, as diuretics do not appear to improve these agents' efficacy. CCBs have a dual mechanism for blood pressure reduction. In addition to their vasodilatory actions, they also promote diuresis and natriuresis. These features account for the striking efficacy of these agents when used as monotherapy in hypertensive patients. Studies have shown that dietary sodium restriction does not appear to improve the efficacy of CCBs, nor is a high-salt diet predictive of a better therapeutic outcome. Recent studies also indicate that the addition of a diuretic to a CCB does not produce a significant or consistent additive antihypertensive effect. Because CCBs do not produce the typical responses of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system to sodium/volume depletion, their diuretic and natriuretic effects do not result in the same adverse metabolic consequences as experienced with traditional diuretic therapy.\r"

At the cell membrane, verapamil helps minimize the effects of excess calcium influx after ischemic injury, evidenced by reduced uptake of 45Ca, thus lessening tubular injury from both calcium-activated phospholipases and mitochondrial calcium overload. In experimental chronic renal failure, the long-term administration of verapamil protects against renal dysfunction and damage, independent of any effect on systemic mean arterial pressure. Protective effects of verapamil are delineated in several models, supporting the presented hypothesis of the pathogenesis of renal failure.\r"

Data from the Framingham cohort have shown that patients with LVH have a severalfold higher risk of sudden death, acute myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular morbidity than those with normal hearts. Common sequelae of LVH are ventricular ectopy, impaired ventricular contractility, myocardial ischemia, and decreased left ventricular filling. The benefits of antihypertensive therapy should not be limited to lowering arterial pressure, but should extend to preventing or reducing target organ damage. A variety of antihypertensive agents, such as calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antiadrenergic drugs, and, to a lesser extent, beta blockers, have been shown to reduce LVH and to improve left ventricular filling. We have shown that calcium channel blockers diminish ventricular ectopy in parallel with the reduction of LVH, whereas antihypertensive therapy with diuretics neither reduced LVH nor suppressed ventricular ectopy, although it lowered arterial pressure to a similar extent. Whether or not these cardiac changes with antihypertensive therapies will improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with LVH remains to be documented.\r"

Stepped-care therapy is a nonphysiologic approach that, due to potential metabolic derangements and stimulation of undesirable reflex responses, may not substantially reduce the cardiovascular and renal complications associated with hypertension or improve long-term survival in many hypertensive patients. Because of fundamental hemodynamic differences related to the age, race, and weight of hypertensive patients, drug treatment often elicits varying responses. Certain classes of drugs are not only more effective but also more appropriate from a physiologic standpoint in specific types of patients. Therapy selection based in part on hemodynamic mechanisms and demographic patterns is a more rational approach to patient management and may contribute to a better overall outcome than has been observed with conventional treatment.\r"

  ".U": "91247496\r", 
  ".W": "Cyclosporine has dramatically improved the success rates for all forms of organ transplantation. However, its use is complicated by the frequent occurrence of hypertension and reversible nephrotoxicity. The iatrogenic hypertension induced by cyclosporine resembles a low-renin, salt-sensitive form of essential hypertension, which is often controlled with salt restriction and therapies counteracting renal salt acquisition, e.g., diuretics and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). CCBs may also counteract the direct vasoconstrictive effects of cyclosporine, as well as the effects of other vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin or thromboxane, that may be stimulated by cyclosporine. Additionally, CCBs may potentiate the immunosuppression of cyclosporine, yet minimize nephrotoxicity. We demonstrated that the in vitro combination of verapamil and cyclosporine had an additive inhibitory effect on the activation and function of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in several assays of the afferent and efferent limbs of immunologic responses. This additive immunosuppression was not likely to have been related to these drugs' effects on interleukin-2 (IL-2) circuitry, since no additive inhibition of IL-2 production or IL-2 responsiveness was found. There was some additive inhibition of IL-2 receptor expression at the higher concentrations of verapamil and cyclosporine that were tested. Although the combination of verapamil and cyclosporine additively inhibited mitogen-induced 45Ca uptake, the inhibitory effect of cyclosporine appears to be due to an inhibition of lymphocyte activation rather than direct inhibition of calcium flux through the slow calcium channel, suggesting that the two drugs do not have additive effects in depressing the transmembrane flux of calcium. More recently, we have demonstrated that the inactive enantiomer of verapamil, which does not block the slow calcium channel, has identical immunosuppressive capabilities as the active enantiomer. Thus, the antiproliferative effect of verapamil is probably slow-calcium-channel independent and may represent the ability of the drug to interfere with muscarinic, alpha 1-adrenergic, or even opiate receptors on lymphocytes or to block lymphocyte potassium channels. An even better possibility is that verapamil may diminish necessary precursor molecule uptake into lymphocytes, since both the inactive and active isomeric forms of verapamil are capable of diminishing thymidine, uridine, and leucine incorporation into stimulated lymphocytes--necessary for DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, respectively. These in vitro observations may have clinical applicability, as early studies demonstrate reduced rejection rates of cyclosporine-treated transplant patients receiving CCBs. Consequently, CCBs are important medications to be considered for use in cyclosporine-treated organ transplant recipients.\r"

  ".W": "Although cyclosporin A (CsA) has allowed substantial advances in organ transplantation due to its immunosuppressive properties, its use is complicated by its direct nephrotoxic effects. Initial studies with mice confirmed that CsA caused a dose-related inhibition of the subcapsular microcirculation; subsequent clinical investigations have confirmed this inhibitory effect. Efforts to circumvent CsA-induced nephrotoxicity have focused on calcium antagonists. For example, when the calcium antagonist verapamil was administered before the initiation of CsA, renal blood flow was maintained. Verapamil therapy was also associated with significantly fewer rejection episodes (3 of 22; 14%) within 4 weeks of transplantation than CsA therapy alone (10 of 18; 56%). In a current study, verapamil 10 mg was injected into the renal artery during surgery, followed by 120 mg tid orally for 14 days. This regimen reduced delayed function incidents (the need for dialysis) during the first post-transplant week. Excluding nonfunctioning kidneys and technical failures, there were no graft losses secondary to rejection in patients treated with verapamil. The beneficial effects of verapamil therapy on transplant outcome may be related to its ability to protect cells from ischemia, the selective vasodilation of the efferent arteriole, elevated CsA blood levels, and inherent immunosuppressive properties.\r"

Although its exact mechanisms of action in this application are unknown, verapamil exerts a vasodilatory effect on cerebral arteries and interacts with serotonergic systems involved in migraine pathogenesis. A review of studies from the past decade indicates that verapamil may be as effective as traditional therapies as prophylaxis for the major types of chronic recurring headache.\r"

  ".W": "In a group of 236 very low birth weight (VLBW) surviving infants, 60 had developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the nursery. When compared with the 176 infants without BPD, infants with BPD were smaller, more immature, with lower one- and five-minute Apgar scores. Infants with BPD had a greater incidence of cardio-pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) complications in the nursery. On follow-up, 25 (42%) of these infants were abnormal developmentally compared to 7% of infants without BPD (p less than .001). When comparisons were made within the group of infants with BPD, very few differences were found in maternal or infant risk factors between the normal and abnormal infants. The infants with BPD who had poor outcome more often had seizures and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). The infants with BPD who had good outcome were more often small for gestational age (SGA) and resuscitated with intubation at birth. They had apnea in the nursery more frequently than did abnormal infants with BPD. We conclude that VLBW infants with BPD are at greater risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome than those without BPD. The risk for the infant with BPD relates to CNS complications rather than to chronic lung disease.\r"

  ".W": "Amyloidosis of the kidney is the most threatening complication in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), and colchicine has been shown to reduce its occurrence. In the preclinical stage of kidney amyloidosis, no proteinuria is observed by the standard Albustix method. However, whether these patients have normal or increased urinary albumin excretion is not known. The purpose of this study was to evaluate albumin excretion in FMF patients treated with colchicine and to compare these values to those of a normal control group. Twenty-two subjects with FMF were compared with 16 normal subjects matched with regard to age and body surface area. The two groups did not differ with regard to female/male ratio and arterial pressure. Urine samples were collected overnight while patients were recumbent and in the daytime while they were ambulant. After measuring albumin concentration (Ua) by radio-immunoassay and creatinine concentration through the standard method, the urinary albumin excretion rate (UaV) and urinary albumin creatinine ratio (Ua/c) were calculated. In the FMF group, three patients had microalbuminuria--defined as an albumin excretion rate higher than 20 micrograms/min. Two of them had this condition only in the early morning collection. These three patients were characterized by a longer duration of symptoms (18 vs. 9 years). No patient in the control group had microalbuminuria. The mean UaV in the FMF group did not differ significantly from that of the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Existing studies on the medical problems of the homeless are largely descriptive and are limited by lack of comparison to nonhomeless persons. To help fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted a retrospective study of the medical problems of homeless and nonhomeless persons cared for in an outpatient clinic serving the medically indigent. Homeless persons (n = 150) were more likely to be identified as alcoholic and to be seen for cuts and gynecologic problems than nonhomeless persons (n = 154) (p less than .01). There were no significant differences in the occurrence of other illnesses considered to be prevalent in the homeless. This study is among the first that validates descriptive data on the health problems of homeless persons by using concurrent nonhomeless controls. It may help in designing programs to meet the medical needs of the homeless.\r"

A sizable percentage of chlamydial infections of the lower genital tract in women progress to endometritis and salpingitis. Tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy are important sequelae. Failure to control chlamydial infections reflects the following four factors: (1) Many cases are mild or asymptomatic; (2) diagnostic tests are expensive and technically demanding; (3) at least 7 days of multiple-dose therapy are currently required; and (4) partner notification is not routinely performed. Thus early identification of infected persons and compliance with curative therapy are less likely than with other sexually transmitted bacterial diseases.\r"

The multifocal retinal lesions resolved gradually without treatment over several months with minimal or no residual retinal changes. Acute multifocal inner retinal lesions may be associated with a preceding nonspecific viral illness and may cause a sudden change in vision if associated with neuroretinitis, serous retinal detachment, or retinal vessel occlusion.

The increase in the palpebral fissure width of the treated eye was compared to the width of the untreated, control eye during a period of 60 minutes after each drug was administered. The difference in fissure width (asymmetry) between the treated and untreated eyes increased significantly for all drugs during the three- to 60-minute time period after treatment. There was no significant difference in the maximum eyelid effect among the adrenergic drugs tested. The drugs exerted their maximum effect by 30 minutes in 39 of the 40 trials (97.5%). The direct-acting drugs tended to exert their effect more quickly than the indirect-acting drugs. Our results demonstrate the expected increase in palpebral fissure width in response to topical adrenergic drugs in normal eyes.

The method seems appropriate for the diagnosis of glaucoma and the follow-up of patients with glaucoma.\r"

Prophylactic peripheral iridectomy had not been performed in any of the eyes. The patients were treated medically, and YAG laser iridotomy was performed successfully one week after initial control of intraocular pressure. Of 16 eyes in which intraocular pressure remained uncontrolled, trabeculectomy was necessary in three eyes and irreversible glaucomatous visual loss occurred in two eyes. Our data demonstrate the need for stringent and more frequent postoperative follow-up of children after intraocular lens implantation, especially during the first four postoperative weeks. Careful long-term follow-up for treatment after cataract is mandatory to prevent development of amblyopia.\r"

As a control, we analyzed all available specular photographs from patients with keratoconus who showed no evidence of allograft rejection after penetrating keratoplasty. The observed endothelial cell density decrease (11.8%) in patients with keratoconus undergoing allograft rejection exceeded that found in the control subjects (6.8%) during a comparable time period (P = .06). Severe allograft rejection episodes resulted in a decrease in endothelial cell density that exceeded expected loss significantly (14.8% compared with 6.9%, P = .01), whereas mild allograft rejection episodes were not associated with a loss in endothelial cell density exceeding that expected (1.8% compared with 6.5%, P = .34).\r"

  ".W": "In a study of the phenotypic characteristics of pedigrees of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy positive for the mitochondrial DNA mutation at position 11778, 28 of 49 pedigrees were represented by singleton cases. Seven families, including six singleton pedigrees, had maternal family members with a mixture of mutant and normal mitochondrial DNA (heteroplasmy). Seventy-two affected individuals from 43 families showed a male predominance of 81.9% (59/72) and ages of onset of visual loss ranging from 8 to 60 years. The time interval between affected eyes averaged 1.8 months; the duration of progression of visual loss in each eye averaged 3.7 months. Visual acuity was 20/200 or worse in 107 of 109 (98.2%) eyes. Telangiectatic microangiopathy, disk pseudoedema, or vascular tortuosity, ophthalmoscopic features believed to be classic of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, were noted in 30 of 52 patients. Visual-evoked responses were typically absent or abnormal. Electrocardiograms, fluorescein angiograms, cerebrospinal fluid analyses, brain computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were usually normal. There were no consistent neurologic or systemic illnesses associated with these Leber's pedigrees. In many cases, the diagnosis would not have been suspected because of the absence of a compatible family history, typical clinical profile, or ophthalmoscopic appearance. Genetic analysis showed the mitochondrial DNA mutation at position 11778, which established the diagnosis of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and has allowed for a broader view of the clinical features of this disease.\r"

The athletes performed four events: broad jump, vertical leap, 10 yard shuttle run, and 40 yard sprint. The events and appliances were randomized to prevent bias by fatigue. Compared to the results when no support was used, ankle taping resulted in a significant decreased performance in the vertical jump (4%), shuttle run (1.6%), and sprint (3.5%) (P less than 0.05). Use of the Swede-O brace decreased performance in the vertical jump (4.6%), broad jump (3.6%), and time of the sprint (3.2%). Results using the Kallassy brace showed a decrease in the vertical jump (3.4%) when compared to no support. The test results of the shuttle run with taping were slower than the Kallassy brace (P less than 0.05). Wearing the Swede-O brace caused the athletes' broad jump distance to decrease more than the Kallassy brace (P less than 0.05). Subjective questionnaires supported the Kallassy brace as the most comfortable support and the one that decreased performance the least. Taping of the ankles is universally accepted for ankle prophylaxis. This study has shown a decrease in performance when ankles are taped compared to ankles with no protection. Since the decreases in performance caused by ankle braces are minor, this should not be used as a criterion for selection of prophylactic support compared to taping.\r"

Both fatigue rates and the amount of time elapsed in reaching fatigue were determined. Analysis of these data reveals that 1) isometric endurance of the forearm complex cannot be used as a predictor of isokinetic endurance, as there is no relationship between the two, 2) dominant and non-dominant endurance are related, a result that supports the belief that in the assessment of the endurance of a single diseased upper extremity, the best available comparison is with the contralateral healthy extremity, and 3) healthy males in the age range tested have greater endurance in elbow extension than in flexion.\r"

The validity of and patient affinity for this type of questionnaire was compared with that of three other established subjective evaluation methods. The visual analog scale system was shown to be valid and comparable to other methods while offering several advantages. It brought greater sensitivity and greater statistical power to data collection and analysis by allowing a broader range of responses than did traditional categorical responses. It removed bias that was introduced by examiner questioning, and it allowed graphic temporal comparisons. Most importantly, patient affinity was higher for this type of subjective evaluation than for other methods.\r"

Chondromalacia of the articular surface of the femur was detected at surgery in 161 patients (32%). A statistical analysis showed that the variables directly influencing degenerative changes of the cartilage are: a previous surgery that did not sufficiently restore joint kinematics (chi square = 20.238, P less than 0.001) and a time lapse of more than 30 months between first trauma and surgery (chi square = 21.736; P = 0.001). A higher score on dynamic (jerk or pivot shift) and static (internal and external anterior drawer) tests, indicating instability, or a meniscal tear alone do not statistically correlate with chondromalacia, but together they influence degenerative changes of the cartilage.\r"

The study included 1818 school children aged 8 to 17 years. Over a period of 7 months, 399 sports injuries were reported in 324 youngsters. The most common types of injuries were contusions (43%) and sprains (21%). Medical attention was needed in 25% of all cases. Young basketball, handball and korfball players had a nearly 100% chance of suffering one sports injury per year. Volleyball especially had a high incidence rate in practice (6.7 in 1000 hours). Although physical education classes had a low incidence rate, there were significantly more fractures on the upper limb. Etiologically, sports-related factors were much more important than personal-bound factors. The injured youths spent more time in practice than the noninjured ones, both in organized and nonorganized sports (P less than 0.001). High-risk sports were characterized by contact, a high jump rate, and indoor activities. These three factors explained 78% of the total variance. The contact versus noncontact factor accounted for 48% of the medically treated injuries. An additional goal of this study was to explore the seasonal influence as an extrinsic environmental factor. We found that the duration of injury was increased in the spring (P less than 0.05). Specific preventive measures were formulated in order to reduce the number of new and recurring injuries and a proposal was made to implement injury prevention in school curriculums.\r"

In the patients, the vastus lateralis fired significantly faster than the vastus medialis obliquus (P less than 0.001).

Two-tailed independent-sample t-tests revealed that the patients demonstrated a significantly faster vastus lateralis response time than the normal subjects (P less than 0.001), whereas the vastus medialis obliquus times were not significantly different. This increase in vastus lateralis reflex response time may indicate a motor control problem in the patient with extensor mechanism dysfunction. Results indicate that there is a reversal of the normal muscular firing order between the two muscles in these patients. Patients with extensor mechanism dysfunction may be demonstrating a neurophysiologic motor control imbalance that may account for or contribute to their anterior knee pain.\r"

Nine of the 10 patients examined had sustained documented intraarticular ligament disruptions including eight ACL disruptions and five posterior cruciate ligament disruptions. The eight patients with ACL injuries had undergone reconstructive surgery. The clinical examination test sequence was performed as described by the International Knee Documentation Committee. Testing results were reported as estimated degrees of angulation or millimeters of displacement. Testing results were divided into two groups based on the index minus nonindex knee difference. Eighteen displacement tests were performed on each knee by each examiner. The index minus nonindex knee difference was greater than 3 mm in 16% of the tests. Only 1 of the 198 displacement tests performed on the subject who did not have a ligament disruption was recorded as an index minus nonindex difference greater than 3 mm. There was appreciable difference between measurements recorded by different examiners, particularly anterior/posterior measurements in patients who had sustained combined anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries. There is a need to rigorously evaluate limits of motion tests that are used to develop treatment plans and report the results of ligament surgery.\r"

We wished to precisely determine the knee motions and medial-lateral tibiofemoral compartment subluxations that examiners induce in the knee joint to produce the pivot shift phenomenon. Eleven skilled knee surgeons performed the pivot shift test on an instrumented cadaveric lower limb. The anterior cruciate and superficial medial collateral ligaments (long fibers) of one limb were sectioned to produce an abnormal state. An instrumented spatial linkage allowed all six degrees of freedom motions to be measured. Before and after ligament sectioning we determined the limits of knee motion under defined loading conditions. The tibial and femoral bony landmarks were digitized to determine the positions of the medial and lateral tibial plateaus in reference to the femoral condyles during the pivot shift tests. Each examiner performed his pivot shift test. The analysis of the data showed that examiners typically induced a coupled anterior translation and internal tibial rotation to produce an anterior tibial subluxation, and a coupled posterior translation and external tibial rotation to induce the reduction event. The magnitude of anterior subluxation of each plateau depended upon the examiner's technique. The maximal anterior subluxation of the lateral tibial plateau varied from 14 to 19.8 mm (mean, 17.2 +/- 2.0 mm), whereas anterior subluxation of the medial tibial plateau ranged from 6 to 16.9 mm (mean, 11.2 +/- 3.3 mm).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty-three (88%) of the patients were reexamined 9 to 16 years later with special emphasis on manual and instrumented stability testing (Stryker, Genucom), knee function score (Lysholm), and activity level (Tegner). Standing roentgenograms (30 degrees of knee flexion) were taken in 69% of the patients. At followup, an ACL reconstruction had been performed in seven patients (12%) due to symptomatic instability. Sixty-four percent of the knees had a positive Lachman sign and 40% a positive pivot shift. Sagittal laxity difference was +3 mm or more in 57%. Knee function score was a mean of 86 +/- 12 points. The mean activity level had changed from recreational team sports (Level 7) to recreational individual sports (Level 5). Only patients with good knee stability were able to perform demanding sports and could continue at their desired activity level. Osteoarthritis of slight to moderate degree (Fairbank I/II) was found in 58% of the patients younger than 35 years of age at the time of trauma and in 87% of the older patients. Knees with intact menisci had less osteoarthritis than knees with removed menisci (P less than 0.05).\r"

To determine the clinician's ability to perform these tasks, we evaluated 11 knee surgeons' clinical examination for knee instability. The positions and motions included were measured in right-left cadaveric knees by a three-dimensional instrumented spacial linkage. We compared the clinicians' estimate of knee motion limits and subluxations with the actual measured values. Before and after the clinicians' examination, the three-dimensional limits of knee motion were measured in the knees in the laboratory under defined loading conditions. Also, in one knee, the ACL and superficial medial collateral ligament were cut and the examiners, none of whom were informed of the sectioning, were asked to arrive at a diagnosis. The results for all of the clinical instability tests were similar. There was wide variability between examiners in the starting position of knee flexion and tibial rotation and in the amount of tibial translation and rotation induced. Although some examiners displaced the knee to the maximal displacement limits obtained in the laboratory, others did not, by a substantial margin. This suggests a wide variation in the loads applied by examiners to the knee joint during the tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen patients with a clinically diagnosed chronic ACL deficient knee on one side and a contralateral ACL intact knee were evaluated by arthrometry and simultaneous radiography after epidural anesthesia was induced. The posterior cruciate ligament was intact in all knees. This paper reports only the anterior position of the tibia at the 89 N anterior force level of the KT-1000 arthrometer (as read from the dial) and the anterior tibial position recorded simultaneously by radiography at the 89 N dial tone. A 3 mm difference in anterior tibial position between the two knees of the same patient was considered diagnostic for ACL deficiency. Arthrometrically, 13 of the 16 patients were diagnosed accurately; radiographically, 13 of the 16 met the criterion. Moderately high significant positive correlation of paired values was obtained in ACL deficient knees by the two methods (correlation, 0.58 and two-tail probability, 0.02). In ACL intact knees there was no correlation of paired values (correlation, 0.01 and two-tail probability, 0.98). We found no numerical equivalency between the measurements obtained by the KT-1000 and simultaneous radiography. Neither did we find an apparent pattern to the differences, or formula we could use to interpolate findings of anterior tibial position from one measurement system to the other. We conclude that an examiner can substantiate a clinical diagnosis of chronic ACL deficiency with both methods. Arthrometry alone may be used to repeatedly follow conservatively treated ACL deficient knees without exposing the patient to radiation. Radiographs obtained under known anterior force levels provide a retrievable record to document the exact tibial position in relation to the femur.\r"

Existing occupational rating scales do not rate, in a valid manner, the effect of altered knee function on work activities. We performed a prospective randomized clinical trial in which two different occupational rating systems were tested on 50 patients. One system used job titles and an arbitrary numeric scale for rating occupations; the other used specific criteria for rating job functions according to the intensity, frequency, and duration of certain tasks. The results showed that an effective and valid rating format should consist of five specific objectives: 1) evaluation of different knee functions that typically occur in the work environment; 2) evaluation of work activities separately from sports activities; 3) detection of patients who may have remained at an occupation but who have significantly modified work activities because of knee symptoms; 4) identification of patients who continue to work despite experiencing moderate to severe symptoms; and 5) identification of patients whose work activities decrease because of nonknee-related factors. Furthermore, the results showed that an effective rating system should identify common data reduction errors that can bias the results in analyzing knee-related occupational limitations. The rating system developed circumvents the bias introduced by these anomalies. This system, if adopted by other researchers, would allow for the comparison of treatment results among studies.\r"

They have been felt to be asymptomatic and are usually found incidentally on routine chest roentgenograms. Symptomatic nonunion of a first rib fracture has not been reported previously. Our patient did not respond to nonoperative treatment and required surgical intervention to alleviate her symptoms. We agree that most fractures of this type heal without complications.

DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized, nonblinded time series. SETTING: The orthostatic and hypotensive patients were seen in a university hospital ED with 44,000 visits per year. Blood donors were studied in the hospital's blood donor center. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two adult ED patients who presented with a history suggestive of hypovolemia and either abnormal orthostatic vital signs (19) or frank hypotension (13), and 47 volunteer blood donors who ranged in age from 19 to 83 participated. INTERVENTIONS: Capillary refill was measured before rehydration in the ED subjects and, in the donor group, before and after a 450-mL blood donation. MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, and study group. MAIN RESULTS: For the blood donor group, mean capillary refill time before donation was 1.4 seconds and after donation was 1.1 seconds. Mean capillary refill time for the orthostatic group was 1.9 seconds and for the hypotensive group was 2.8 seconds. When scored with age-sex specific upper limits of normal, the sensitivity of capillary refill in identifying hypovolemic patients was 6% for the 450-mL blood loss group, 26% for the orthostatic group, and 46% for the hypotensive group. The accuracy of capillary refill in a patient with a 50% prior probability of hypovolemia is 64%. Orthostatic vital signs were found to be more sensitive and specific than capillary refill in detecting the 450-mL blood loss. CONCLUSION: Capillary refill does not appear to be a useful test for detecting mild-to-moderate hypovolemia in adults.\r"

TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight adult cocaine abusers admitted with chest pain. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients included 34 men and 14 women with a mean age of 29 +/- 7.3 years. The average duration of cocaine abuse in 28 patients for whom it was reported was 5 +/- 4.8 years. Chest pain occurred within one hour of cocaine abuse in 13 admissions (27%), more than one hour after abuse in 13 admissions (27%), and it was not recorded in 23 admissions (47%).

Cardiopulmonary symptoms were more frequently associated with intranasal than with IV or smoked cocaine (P = .003). Suicidal intent was the most common psychiatric reason for presentation, occurring in 24 patients (16.6%). Seventeen presented with trauma, including three involved in motor vehicle accidents. CONCLUSION: Cardiopulmonary symptoms such as chest pain and palpitations may be significantly more frequent in patients who use intranasal cocaine; suicidal intent is common among patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms related to cocaine; and the range of cocaine-related symptoms is varied, including not only psychiatric and cardiopulmonary symptoms but also trauma.\r"

The death certificates were abstracted; all deaths under age 60 and a 20% sample of deaths 60 and older were examined.

RESULTS: Cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents) and injuries accounted for 49% and 25% of the overseas deaths of US citizen travelers, respectively. Infectious diseases other than pneumonia accounted for only 1% of the deaths. Eighty percent of injury deaths occurred outside of hospitals. Injury death rates for male travelers were greater than US age-specific death rates. CONCLUSIONS: Greater emphasis on the prevention of fatal events, especially those resulting from injury, must be given by physicians and other individuals and organizations who advise travelers. Further studies are needed to explore the issues of preventable injury deaths, emergency medical services, and overseas travel.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Admissions to a children's hospital from October 1982 through September 1989 who were found to have liver or spleen injuries. Seventy-seven patients were identified; 55 were male, 22 were female. Mean age was 9 years and 3 months (+/- 56 months) with a range of 22 months to 20 years, 4 months. Clinical signs were recorded and a Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS) and Injury Severity Score (ISS) were calculated for each patient. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (70%) had a spleen injury, 18 (23%) had a liver injury, and five (7%) had both liver and spleen injuries. Patients were managed without surgery in 63 of 77 cases (82%); two died. Fifty-one of 77 patients (66%) received an ISS of 18 or less; 26 patients (34%) received a score of more than 18. Forty-four of the 51 patients (86%) with an ISS of 18 or less had a normal pulse (120 or less); 48 of the 51 (94%) had a normal systolic blood pressure (90 mm Hg or more). A strong negative correlation (r = -0.80; P = .001) was found between the two scores for children with multiple severe injuries (ISS of more than 18); there was poor correlation (r = -0.04; P greater than .05) between the two scores for isolated liver or spleen injury (ISS of 18 or less). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that liver or spleen damage may be present in children without other injuries and must be considered with a high index of suspicion, and that neither the initial clinical findings nor the PTS reliably predicts liver or spleen injuries in children with focal abdominal injuries.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Municipal children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 144 patients treated in the cardiopulmonary/trauma resuscitation room over a 17-month period. INTERVENTION: Emergency department records of these patients were reviewed for medical information required by Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations guidelines: history of present illness, medical history, vital signs, physical examination, laboratory results, clinical observations, and diagnostic impression. In addition, the frequency of medical record review by legal representatives of the patient and by the state's social service agencies was evaluated. RESULTS: Attending physicians demonstrated more complete documentation than residents in clinical observations of patients (36.4% vs 18.0%, P less than .005) and diagnostic impression (97% vs. 78.4%, P less than .03). Nurses demonstrated more complete documentation than physicians, as a group, in laboratory results (83.9% vs 47.6%, P less than .001) and clinical observations (80.6% vs 22.2%, P less than .001). Sixty-six medical records (37.9%) were subjected to legal review: 37 (21.3%) by patients' legal representatives, and 29 (16.7%) by the state's social service agency. CONCLUSION: ED record documentation of pediatric patients treated in a cardiopulmonary/trauma resuscitation room often does not meet standard guidelines. Complete documentation is important due to the frequency of legal review of these records and the need to ensure post-ED continuity of care.\r"

DESIGN: Rectal thiopental 25 mg/kg was compared with the combination of meperidine 2 mg/kg, promethazine 1 mg/kg, and chlorpromazine 1 mg/kg in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Children between 18 months and 6 years of age presenting to our teaching hospital ED for laceration repair were entered after the clinical decision was made to sedate. Patients with altered sensorium, medical contraindications to sedation, or medication allergy were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: After informed consent, each patient received IM injection (drug combination or placebo) and rectal suspension (rectal thiopental or placebo) simultaneously. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Vital signs, pulse oximetry, and pediatric Glasgow Coma Scores were recorded before and every 15 minutes after sedation until discharge. Intradermal lidocaine and suturing began when the patient appeared adequately sedated, and response was numerically scored. Patients were discharged when able to stand. Twenty-nine patients 34 +/- 13 months old were studied. Fifteen patients received rectal thiopental, and 14 received the drug combination. Analysis using the Wilcoxon two-sample test revealed no differences in age, sex, weight, or wound location between groups. The time course of sedation was different for the two treatment regimens. At 15 and 30 minutes after administration, patients who received rectal thiopental were more deeply sedated than those who received the drug combination, as evidenced by significantly lower Glasgow Coma Scores (P less than .05). Accordingly, time from medication administration to suturing was 29 +/- 12 minutes in the thiopental group and 54 +/- 33 minutes (P less than .01) in the drug combination group. Patients in the thiopental group also recovered more quickly and were discharged approximately one-half hour earlier than those in the drug combination group (89 +/- 25 vs 120 +/- 44 minutes, P less than .05). No difference in response to lidocaine injection or suturing was demonstrated between the groups. Laceration repair time was comparable between the groups. There were eight sedation failures (three of 15 in thiopental group and five of 14 in drug combination group, P = NS). Vital signs remained stable, no adverse reactions occurred, and no patient had decreased oxygen saturation to less than 95%. CONCLUSION: Rectal thiopental is superior to this drug combination for pediatric sedation because it can be administered painlessly, has a more rapid onset and offset of action, and is of equal safety and efficacy at the dosage studied.\r"

DESIGN: During a two-year period, patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, unblinded, controlled trial. SETTING: All patients were recruited and studied in a pediatric emergency department. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy children less than 6 years old (mean age, 2.4 +/- 0.2 years) who presented with mild-to-moderate acute oral ingestions. INTERVENTIONS: Group 1 received SOI before AC. Group 2 received only AC. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Group 1 patients took significantly longer to receive AC than group 2 from the time of ED arrival (2.6 +/- 0.1 vs 0.9 +/- 0.1 hours, P less than .0001). Group 1 children were significantly more likely to vomit AC than were group 2 children (18 of 32 vs six of 38, P less than .001). Patients receiving SOI who were subsequently discharged spent significantly more time in the ED than those receiving only AC (4.1 +/- 0.2 vs 3.4 +/- 0.2 hours, P less than .05). CONCLUSIONS: Ipecac delays the administration of AC, hinders its retention, and prolongs ED time in pediatric ingestion patients. These data support the recommendation that AC alone should be the gastrointestinal decontamination method of choice for the mild-to-moderate pediatric ingestion patient presenting to an ED.\r"

This represents the third most common mechanism of injury in this age group. Mean patient age at the time of injury was 8.7 months. Of the 19 accidents involving walkers, 18 (94.7%) involved falling down stairs. Nine children (47.4% of all walker-related injuries) suffered fractures of the cranial vault. No patients required surgical intervention, although one required treatment for post-traumatic meningitis. CONCLUSION: Baby walkers continue to be a frequent cause of head injury in this age group, and further efforts must be made to deal with these preventable injuries.\r"

Program directors should establish liaisons with the medical school dean to acquaint him with the advantages of an autonomous department of emergency medicine; attempt to assess other relationships within the medical school to determine support for emergency medicine and to uncover and address opposition to autonomous departmental status; attempt to serve on medical school committees to meet other faculty, solve problems with them and develop trusting relationships; and develop broad-based support for autonomous departmental status both within and outside of the university. By devising and following a deliberate approach to attaining departmental status, emergency medicine will be assured of continued growth in the important decade ahead.\r"

  ".W": "Advance directives are becoming more common in the health care system in the United States. Advance directives include \"living wills,\" \"durable powers of attorney for health care,\" \"do not resuscitate orders,\" and the newer \"medical directive.\" They are designed to allow individuals to determine the course of their medical care in the event that they are no longer able to transmit the information to their physician. The US Supreme Court's recent Cruzan decision increased the importance of these legal instruments by declaring that \"clear and convincing\" evidence may be required by states in order to terminate life support in a patient unable to express his wishes about care. Unfortunately, for many reasons, advance directives are often not completed by those who might desire them. Only 9% of Americans have executed advance directives. Emergency physicians have the opportunity to assist their patients in advance by disseminating advance directives to those who have contact with the emergency department: patients, family members, friends, health care workers, emergency medical services personnel, and police. A plan is suggested that includes education, the availability of advance directives, personnel available to help with completion of the documents, and immediate entry of the directive into a medical chart, if requested. This is in conformance with a recent policy adopted by the American College of Emergency Physicians.\r"

Endoscopic techniques would be facilitated by methods of welding gallbladder tissues. The technical constraints imposed by the endoscopic approach favor nonsuture methods of fusing gallbladder tissues. To evaluate a laser method for fusing biliary tissue, we have compared the healing response of laser-welded versus polyglycolic acid suture-closed incisions in canine gallbladder tissue in vivo. The laser used was a thulium-holmium-chromium:YAG laser producing 200-microsecond, 300-millijoule pulses at 2.15 microns. Serial sacrifice of dogs that underwent laser or suture closure of incisions made in the fundus of the gallbladder revealed that all repairs healed without evidence of leakage or infection. Laser-welded cholecystotomy sites had complete fibrous healing of the wound by two weeks postoperatively and reepithelialization by three weeks after operation. Suture-closed wounds were still without complete epithelization four weeks after the procedure. Laser welding may be a useful technique in endoscopic biliary surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Four hundred twelve patients underwent gastric bypass for treatment of morbid obesity between 1981 and 1985 at the University of Florida Affiliated Hospitals. Thirty-four patients (8.2%) developed marginal ulcers, considerably higher than the 0-3 per cent ulcer occurrence commonly reported in the literature. Factors predisposing to ulcer formation include: (1) a large gastric pouch; (2) a vertically oriented pouch; and (3) staple-line dehiscence. Twenty-two of 34 patients (65%) with symptomatic marginal ulcers were noted to have staple-line disruption. Twenty-one of these patients (95%) eventually required operative therapy for their ulcers compared with four of 12 patients (33%) with an intact gastric staple line. Surgical therapy consisted of takedown of the Roux-en-Y limb with resection of the ulcer and gastrogastrostomy. Staple-line dehiscence is a significant etiologic factor in the development of marginal ulcer following gastric bypass and when present constitutes an indication for reoperation.\r"

  ".W": "The usefulness of many \"routine\" medical procedures is being challenged in the health care atmosphere of today. This study was undertaken to determine the utility of routine microscopic pathologic examination of three frequently submitted surgical specimens. Pathology reports of 39,568 consecutive specimens, 17,105 appendices, 14,654 hernia sacs, and 7,809 gallbladders, submitted over a 49-year period, were reviewed. Microscopic examination of these tissues detected few unexpected findings. In those instances in which unexpected findings were discovered the primary surgery was curative or additional surgery would not have altered the prognosis. When careful, thorough gross examination by the surgeon and pathologist failed to disclose significant abnormalities or confirmed obvious disease such as inflammation, microscopic examination of these tissues might have been eliminated without a change in patient outcome. Although it could be argued that this microscopic pathologic correlation may be helpful for quality control and/or feedback of surgical decision making, the data indicate that gross examination alone may be sufficient in most cases, since unexpected microscopic findings are rare. The indications for microscopic examination of appendices, hernia sacs, and gallbladders are listed. Substantial savings of resources and time may be expected when selective microscopic examination is used.\r"

Pancreatojejunostomy is probably the main cause of morbidity, and controversy concerning the best type of reconstruction still exists. In this report the technique of pancreatojejunostomy is demonstrated. An end-to-side pancreatojejunostomy is performed on all patients. For patients with a pancreatic duct of less than 4 mm in diameter, the top of the pancreatic duct is inserted into a stab-wound of jejunum. It is secured with a purse-string suture. Furthermore, two layers of reinforcement are done. By using this technique, an end-to-side anastomosis was done on patients with soft glands and small ducts. In patients with a pancreatic duct greater than 4 mm, a three-layer anastomosis is done between pancreas and jejunum. This is a technique that allows the performance of an end-to-side anastomosis regardless of the pancreas consistency or pancreatic duct diameter.\r"

Treatment has been controversial, particularly the role of elective resection following successful nonoperative reduction. The Army Medical Center experience with colonic volvulus from 1983 through 1987 is reviewed. Fifty-four patients at the eight medical centers carried this diagnosis. Their presenting signs and symptoms are discussed. The Army patients are compared and contrasted with reviews presented in the surgical literature, and conclusions are made to give guidelines for diagnosis and treatment.\r"

An increase over previous rates of 13 per cent and 0 per cent in 1964 and 1944 was confirmed in this study. Perforation accompanied 44 of 240 cases of appendicitis (18.3%); diagnostic accuracy in 295 cases undergoing operation was 81.4 per cent. Groups at risk for perforation were patients in the first decade of life (34.3% with perforations) and those over 50 years of age (48% perforated). Perforation rates were generally inversely related to accuracy. Accuracy was poorest in women in the second to fourth decade or those in the mid-portion of the menstrual cycle. When the appendix was not perforated, complications occurred in 8.7 per cent of patients while 29.5 per cent with a perforation had a complication. The mean hospital stay was prolonged by 2.5 days if the appendix was perforated. An increased awareness of the risk by both the public and physicians is essential to reduce the number of perforations.\r"

A report from the American Cancer Society projects an even greater decline to 0.65 per cent in the incidence of this almost incurable disease within the next 1-2 years. The decrease in the incidence of cancer of the gallbladder is attributed to the great increase in the performance of elective cholecystectomy for chronic cholecystitis among people 50 years of age or younger, before they have reached the age when carcinoma of the gallbladder is most prevalent. Early surgery is advocated not only as an effective and safe form of therapy but also as a valuable preventive measure.\r"

Seventeen patients developed anastomotic recurrence. Fourteen patients had elevated serum CEA levels, and 15 patients had endoscopic evidence suggesting recurrence at the anastomotic site. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated metastatic disease in seven patients, localized anastomotic disease in six patients, and no evidence of disease in four patients. Laparotomy was then carried out in 10 patients. In eight of 10 patients, it was possible to resect localized disease. In a 3-year follow-up study, eight patients were alive, four without any evidence of recurrent disease. Repeat colonoscopy and serum CEA measurements are recommended as postoperative surveillance for carcinoma of the colon and rectum. In select cases laparotomy and resection may prolong survival.\r"

Less frequent dosing reduces the contact time between host tissue binding sites and drug. Thanks to the PAE and perhaps other as-yet-unrecognized factors, the fall in the level in serum below the MIC does not appear to impair antibacterial efficacy; in fact, the higher peak level in serum may enhance drug efficacy early in a dosage interval. In neutropenic patients, the in vivo PAE may be lost or small-colony variants with a shorter PAE may be selected unless a concomitant beta-lactam is administered. Because it will be some time before data from clinical trials in the United States are available, because the results from the international trials are encouraging, and because there is potential benefit to patients, it seems reasonable for infectious diseases consultants to cautiously initiate the educational process necessary to implement once-daily aminoglycoside therapy in their institutions.\r"

At 24 h schedule 2 gave higher chloroquine levels in blood, which induced a more rapid decrease in parasitemia. The time required for a 50% decrease in the initial parasitemia was shorter in patients on schedule 2 (14.3 +/- 1.6 h) than it was in patients on schedule 1 (35.5 +/- 5.4 h; P less than 0.01). Moreover, negative blood smears were obtained more rapidly with schedule 2 (50.8 +/- 3.7 h) than with schedule 1 (72 +/- 8.7 h). As predicted by the drug concentration-time curve, no high, potentially toxic peak drug concentration appeared and no adverse effects were observed with the loading dose regimen (schedule 2). These findings support the idea that a loading dose of 20 mg/kg given at intervals during the first 12 h is well tolerated and can be used to obtain a more rapid decrease in parasitemia and to shorten the treatment time of uncomplicated chloroquine-susceptible falciparum malaria in the field.\r"

Unlike DS-5000, however, the plant lectins did not inhibit the replication of other enveloped viruses, except for human cytomegalovirus (50% effective concentration, 0.9 to 1.6 microgram/ml). The plant lectins suppressed syncytium formation between persistently HIV-1- or HIV-2-infected HUT-78 cells and uninfected MOLT-4 (clone 8) cells at concentrations that were 5- to 10-fold lower than that required for DS-5000. Unlike DS-5000, however, the plant lectins did not inhibit HIV-1 binding to CD4+ cells. Combination of the plant lectins with DS-5000 led to a potent synergistic inhibition of HIV-1-induced cytopathogenicity in MT-4 cells and syncytium formation between HIV-infected HUT-78 cells and MOLT-4 cells. Our data suggest that alpha-(1-3)-D- and alpha-(1-6)-D-mannose-specific plant lectins interfere with an event in the HIV replicative cycle that is subsequent to the attachment of the virions to the cells (i.e., the fusion process).\r"

The in vitro concentration-effect relationships were determined in short-term growth experiments. The in vivo dose-effect relationships were determined in an experimental thigh muscle infection in irradiated mice. In this model, E. coli was injected into one thigh muscle and K. pneumoniae was injected into the other. Throughout these experiments aztreonam was administered subcutaneously and tigemonam was administered orally. For analysis of the antibacterial pharmacodynamics, the following parameters were determined: the maximum effect as a parameter for efficacy, the 50% effective concentration (or dose) as a parameter for potency, and the slope of the concentration-effect relationship. To assess the relationship between the concentration of the antibiotic and the antibacterial effect in vivo, the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs in the plasma of mice were determined as well. The maximum in vitro and in vivo effects of aztreonam and tigemonam against both bacteria did not differ substantially. However, both drugs killed E. coli more effectively than K. pneumoniae, indicating that the maximum in vitro effect of these drugs against E. coli was higher than that against K. pneumoniae. The maximum in vivo effect of both drugs against E. coli was similar to that against K. pneumoniae. Furthermore, in vitro aztreonam was about twice as potent as tigemonam, but in vivo the reverse was the case. These findings were explained by pharmacokinetic differences between subcutaneously administered aztreonam and orally administered tigemonam, because concentrations of tigemonam in plasma remained at microbiologically active concentrations longer than those of aztreonam did.\r"

Temafloxacin had potency equal to that of ciprofloxacin and was twofold more active than ofloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes. Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bordetella pertussis. Against Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, temafloxacin was four- and twofold less potent than ciprofloxacin, respectively.

Female C3H/He mice were genitally inoculated with a human strain of Chlamydia trachomatis and then treated with roxithromycin glutamate subcutaneously. Treatment was initiated either 7 or 10 days postinfection (p.i.) and continued for 7 days at a dosage of 50 or 100 mg/kg of body weight per 24 h. The course of the disease was monitored serologically, bacteriologically, and histologically. At the end of the treatment, the mice were encaged with males and their reproductive capacity was recorded over a 19-week period. The protective effect of roxithromycin was assessed in terms of fertility parameters in comparison with values for noninfected control mice. When treatment was initiated on day 7 p.i. and given in twice-daily 25-mg/kg doses, all the mice remained fertile and the total number of offspring was similar to that of sham-infected mice (17.3 +/- 3.3 versus 17.2 +/- 2.3). When treatment was initiated on day 10 p.i. and given in a single daily dose of 50 or 100 mg/kg, 90 and 70% of the mice, respectively, remained fertile; however, in terms of total offspring, fertility was lower in the group treated with the lower dose (5.6 +/- 1.4 versus 13.0 +/- 3.8). Roxithromycin was found to be effective against C. trachomatis in the mouse genital tract, but fertility was only partially preserved when the time between infection and treatment was prolonged.\r"

The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of temafloxacin were determined in healthy volunteers after administration of single oral doses of 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1,000 mg. The corresponding peak concentrations in plasma (mean +/- standard deviation) were 0.98 +/- 0.26, 1.61 +/- 0.57, 2.43 +/- 0.56, 3.87 +/- 0.64, 4.54 +/- 1.03, and 6.67 +/- 0.74 micrograms/ml. The times that elapsed to attain peak levels ranged from 1.25 to 3.5 h. Statistical analyses of parameters related to the extent of absorption and the linearity of the dispositional pharmacokinetics detected no dose-related trends. Study-wide, total clearance (223 ml/min) and renal clearance (125 ml/min) showed low intersubject variability, with coefficients of variation near 20%. The terminal-phase rate constant of 0.090 +/- 0.008 h-1 corresponds to a half-life of 7.7 h. Temafloxacin was excreted mainly in the urine, with 57 +/- 11% of the dose appearing in the urine unchanged. Conjugated temafloxacin, oxidative metabolites, and conjugates thereof were minor components in urine, collectively accounting for 5 to 8% of the dose. Since intravenously dosed dogs eliminated 50% of the dose by nonrenal processes, urinary recoveries approaching two-thirds of the dose in humans were consistent with high, if not quantitative, absorption. Reported adverse events were generally mild, were randomly distributed between temafloxacin- and placebo-treated subjects, and were not dose related.\r"

With the exception of Providencia spp., E-4497 inhibited 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Against enteric bacteria, E-4497 was similar in potency to norfloxacin but less potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs of E-4497, DR-3355, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin for 90% of strains were 2, 2, 4, and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis, E-4497 (MICs for 90% of strains, 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively) was two- to fourfold more active than norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 activity decreased moderately in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. Urine at pH 5.5 caused a significant decrease in activity compared with urine at pH 7.2. However, the presence of serum either had no effect or increased the activity of E-4497. In general, E-4497 was bactericidal at the MIC. In systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice, the protective effect of E-4497 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and comparable to those of DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin.\r"

In this study, using a nondenaturing filter elution method, a marked induction of double-strand DNA breaks in human lymphoblastoid cells exposed to 80 micrograms of ciprofloxacin per ml was seen. The proportion of single-strand versus double-strand DNA breaks was similar to that seen with the topoisomerase II inhibitory antitumor agent VP-16. The cellular recovery was more rapid after treatment with ciprofloxacin than after treatment with VP-16, displaying a normal elution profile within 15 min at 37 degrees C (60 min for VP-16). These data indicate that ciprofloxacin has an effect on intracellularly located topoisomerase II in humans.\r"

Recently, a wide range of new macrolide antibiotics has been developed, among which the drug clarithromycin appears to have a selective action against M. avium bacteria. In the present study, we have investigated the action of clarithromycin alone (MIC and MBC determinations) and in association with the routine antimycobacterial drugs ethambutol and rifampin at sublethal concentrations (1 micrograms/ml; below concentrations obtainable in human serum) against M. avium. Our viable count data showed that clarithromycin was bactericidal against all 10 strains of M. avium studied and that its activity was enhanced by ethambutol (in 8 of 9 strains) and rifampin (in 3 of 9 strains). The use of all three drugs in association resulted in higher bactericidal effects than found with any of the drugs used alone or in two-drug combinations in seven of nine strains. The bactericidal effects of various drugs used alone and in combination at concentrations obtainable in human serum were investigated against the type strain ATCC 15769 by using 7H9 broth and BACTEC radiometry (extracellular action) and a J-774 macrophage cell line (intracellular action). A good agreement between the extracellular and intracellular activities was found. Electron microscopy using a ruthenium red cytochemical staining of the bacteria showed that clarithromycin disorganized the outer wall layer and the cytoplasmic membrane in the mycobacterial cell envelope and resulted in formation of large vacuoles inside the cytoplasm, with solubilization of ribosomal structures and consequent plasmolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although catQ was expressed constitutively, sequences similar in structure to those found upstream of inducible cat genes were observed.

The deduced CATQ monomer had considerable amino acid sequence conservation compared with CATP (53% similarity) and other known CAT proteins (39 to 53%).

An eightfold dilution of Luria broth was used as the basic growth medium and was supplemented with up to 4% phosphate, 5% glucose, or 12% L-glutamate. Decreases in cephaloridine and ceftazidime susceptibility, of two- and eightfold, respectively, were observed only in the glucose-enriched medium. The outer membrane permeability to ceftazidime and cephaloridine was evaluated by crypticity indices. Indices were unchanged under all growth conditions. Fluorometry of whole cells with 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine showed that glucose does not affect the interaction of this hydrophobic probe with the membranes but showed that elevated concentrations of phosphate or glutamate cause a marked increase in cell hydrophobicity, which, in turn, correlates with an increase in the susceptibility of E. coli to nalidixic acid. Growth in phosphate- or glutamate-enriched media caused an augmentation in major phospholipid species and may explain the increased hydrophobicity and susceptibility of E. coli to nalidixic acid. These data showed that E. coli susceptibility to ceftazidime is not influenced by cell surface hydrophobicity and suggested that the contribution of a nonspecific lipophilic diffusion route for entry of ceftazidime into cells is not likely to occur or is distinct from that of more hydrophobic molecules such as nalidixic acid. Finally, the penicillin-binding proteins of the E. coli cells were also investigated. Penicillin-binding protein 8 was only markedly labeled with 125I-penicillin V in inner membranes extracted from cells grown with glucose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Over 90% of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, piperacillin, ceftazidime, ticarcillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, and carumonam by both methods. Standard disk diffusion yielded unacceptably high false-susceptibility results with aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and temafloxacin. Piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin were not bactericidal for three selected P. pseudomallei strains as determined by time-kill curve methods. Furthermore, addition of ciprofloxacin to piperacillin, ceftazidime, or imipenem did not enhance bactericidal activity. One hundred ninety-four strains showed weak beta-lactamase production that did not increase upon incubation with cefoxitin. These findings suggest that several newer antimicrobial agents may prove useful in the treatment of melioidosis. However, results of susceptibility studies involving P. pseudomallei and newer agents must be interpreted with caution.\r"

  ".W": "The activities of various types of antiulcer agents against Helicobacter pylori (formerly called Campylobacter pylori) strains were determined by an agar dilution method. Among the compounds tested, two benzimidazole proton pump inhibitors, lansoprazole (AG-1749) and omeprazole, were found to have significant activities against this organism. The activity of lansoprazole was comparable to that of bismuth citrate, with MICs ranging from 3.13 to 12.5 micrograms/ml, and fourfold more potent than that of omeprazole. A major metabolite and two acid-converted rearrangement products of lansoprazole also exhibited good activities comparable or superior to that of the parent compound. Exposure to lansoprazole of H. pylori growing in a liquid medium led to an extensive loss of viability without a reduction in culture turbidity and produced an aberrant bacterial morphology characterized by the irregular constriction of cells and the collapse of cell surface structures. The antibacterial activity of lansoprazole and its related compounds was selective against H. pylori; common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and Campylobacter jejuni were not inhibited by 100 micrograms/ml.\r"

  ".U": "91247779\r", 
  ".W": "SDZ MRL 953, a new synthetic monosaccharidic lipid A, was investigated in vitro and in vivo for immunopharmacological activities. In experimental models of microbial infections, the compound was highly protective when it was administered prophylactically either once or three times to myelosuppressed or immunocompetent mice. The 50% effective doses of SDZ MRL 953 varied with the infectious agents and the route of its administration. In all cases, the 50% effective doses were about 10(3) times higher than those obtained with endotoxin from Salmonella abortus equi. SDZ MRL 953 was, however, less toxic than lipopolysaccharide by a factor of 10(4) to greater than 7 x 10(5) times in galactosamine-sensitized mice. The compound was also an effective inducer of tolerance to endotoxin. Hence, repeated dosing with the compound induced a transient resistance (greater than or equal to 1 week) to lethal challenges with endotoxin. In vitro, the compound was devoid of intrinsic antimicrobial activity, but it moderately induced the release of cytokines from monocytes and primed human neutrophils for the enhanced production of reactive oxygen metabolites in response to a soluble stimulus. The results presented here suggest that SDZ MRL 953 may be useful in a clinical setting for enhancing resistance to infections, particularly in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy or irradiation, and for the prophylaxis of endotoxin shock.\r"

SDZ MRL 953, a novel monosaccharidic lipid A analog as a prototype immunostimulant, and cefotaxime or gentamicin were administered to normal or myelosuppressed mice in a state of advanced sepsis caused by Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus. In this novel model, antibiotic therapy was initiated when the infected mice appeared moribund. At this stage, neither pretreatment with the immunostimulant nor therapy with high doses of cefotaxime or gentamicin was effective in protecting the animals from fatal sepsis. However, pretreatment with a single dose of SDZ MRL 953 1 day prior to microbial inoculation dramatically improved the curative effects of the antibiotics. Hence, long-term survival was significantly enhanced with increasing doses of the immunostimulant in the combined therapy. Peritoneal macrophages from SDZ MRL 953-pretreated animals were primed for enhanced production of microbicidal reactive oxygen metabolites in vitro. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that SDZ MRL 953 is a potential candidate for use in a clinical setting as an adjunct to antimicrobial therapy for infections that cannot be treated successfully with appropriate antibiotics alone.\r"

As compared with the susceptible E. coli Q1 isolated before treatment, changes in outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharides in Q2 were associated with a 1.5- to 3-fold decrease in the uptake of fluoroquinolones but not nalidixic acid. A 50% inhibition of DNA synthesis in toluene-permeabilized cells of the resistant strain E. coli Q2 required up to 500-fold increased quantities of fluoroquinolones, whereas such inhibition was obtained in both E. coli Q1 and Q2 with similar amounts of nalidixic acid. Selection from E. coli Q1 on norfloxacin of one-step resistant mutants resembling E. coli Q2 was unsuccessful. From these results we infer that a decrease in outer membrane permeability, associated with a peculiar alteration of the DNA gyrase, was responsible for the unusual quinolone resistance phenotype of E. coli Q2.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that Nocardia brasiliensis is susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and that its beta-lactamases are inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid. A cardiac transplant patient with disseminated infection caused by N. brasiliensis was treated with this drug combination with good response, but relapsed while still on therapy. The relapse isolate was found to be identical to the initial isolate by using genomic DNA restriction fragment patterns obtained by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, but it was resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. On isoelectric focusing, the beta-lactamase from the relapse isolate exhibited a shift in the isoelectric point (pI) of its major band from 5.10 to 5.04 compared with the enzyme from the pretreatment isolate. As determined by using values of the amount of beta-lactamase inhibitor necessary to give 50 +/- 5% inhibition of beta-lactamase-mediated hydrolysis of 50 microM nitrocefin, the beta-lactamase of the relapse isolate was also 200-fold more resistant than the enzyme from the pretreatment isolate to clavulanic acid and was more resistant to sulbactam, tazobactam, cloxacillin, and imipenem. The beta-lactamase of the relapse isolate exhibited a 10-fold decrease in hydrolytic activity for cephaloridine and other hydrolyzable cephalosporins compared with that for nitrocefin. Acquired resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in this isolate of N. brasiliensis appears to have resulted from a mutational change affecting the inhibitor and active site(s) in the beta-lactamase.\r"

Each patient was monitored during the treatment (range, 12 to 60 months), and clinical and biological information was computerized. Various treatments were prescribed, including doxycycline alone (9 cases) or in association with rifampin (4 cases), quinolones (16 cases), or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (1 case). Two patients died before the beginning of the treatment. Nineteen patients had hemodynamic failure and subsequently underwent valve replacement. Nine valve tissue cultures were positive despite previous antibiotic treatment. In terms of their effects on mortality, the difference between doxycycline alone and doxycycline plus quinolones is statistically significant. We conclude that the addition of quinolones to doxycycline is beneficial. On the basis of clinical, serological, and valve tissue culture results, no treatment was able to cure Q fever endocarditis within 2 years, even with a combination of antibiotics. We advise a minimum duration of treatment of 3 years with therapy combining quinolones and doxycycline.\r"

A total of 19 subjects received ofloxacin for an average of 8 weeks, and 14 received parenteral antibiotics for an average of 4 weeks; both therapies were well tolerated. Infections were due to Staphylococcus aureus (40%), Enterococcus spp. (3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), and other gram-negative organisms (42%). At the completion of therapy, one P. aeruginosa infection in the ofloxacin group persisted and the organism acquired resistance, accompanied by a resistant Acinetobacter superinfection. In the parenteral group, one S. aureus infection persisted, and there was a resolved superinfection due to S. aureus as well. Eighteen-month follow-up data have been obtained. Among those treated with ofloxacin, four subjects whose initial response to therapy was successful suffered relapses of infection, three due to S. aureus and one due to P. aeruginosa, while in the parenteral group, one subject with a P. aeruginosa infection relapsed. Long-term response to therapy was successful for 14 of 19 (74%) subjects who received ofloxacin and 12 of 14 (86%) who received parenteral antibiotics; the difference was not significant. Oral ofloxacin appears comparable to parenteral antibiotics in chronic osteomyelitis due to susceptible organisms, and oral ofloxacin offers advantages in economics and convenience.\r"

Representative (KRM-1648) MICs for 90% of the strains tested, determined by the agar dilution method on 7H11 medium, of various pathogenic mycobacteria (9 species, 174 strains) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): Mycobacterium tuberculosis (rifampin [RMP]-susceptible strains), less than or equal to 0.0125; M. tuberculosis (RMP-resistant strains), 12.5; M. kansasii, 0.05; M. marinum, less than or equal to 0.0125; M. scrofulaceum, 0.1; M. avium, 1.56; M. intracellulare, 0.1; M. fortuitum, greater than 100; and M. chelonae subsp. abscessus and M. chelonae subsp. chelonae, greater than 100. These values are more than 64 times lower than those of RMP, except for the values against RMP-resistant M. tuberculosis (8 times lower) and those against rapid growers, including M. fortuitum and M. chelonae (the same as those of RMP). The other derivatives had similar levels of in vitro activity against these mycobacteria. When murine peritoneal macrophages in which M. intracellulare was phagocytosed in vitro were cultured in the presence of the benzoxazinorifamycins (1 microgram/ml), much more rapid killing of the organisms ingested in the macrophages was seen compared with when the same amount of RMP was added to the medium. The addition of benzoxazinorifamycins at the concentration of 0.05 micrograms/ml caused more marked suppression of intracellular growth of the organisms compared with addition of RMP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Consecutive modifications in the composition of the fecal floras were limited to a decrease in counts of total members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The rest of the intestinal floras, including the predominant anaerobic floras, changed little. No overgrowth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci, fungi, or highly erythromycin-resistant strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae was observed. The strains of Enterobacteriaceae and of anaerobes isolated during treatment were not markedly more resistant to roxithromycin than those isolated before treatment started. Changes in intestinal resistance to colonization by exogenous microorganisms in gnotobiotic mice inoculated with human fecal flora were studied and were also found to be minimal. The impact of oral roxithromycin on the intestinal microbiota appears to be weaker than that previously observed with oral erythromycin, perhaps because the concentrations of roxithromycin in the feces were lower than those previously found for erythromycin.\r"

Bactericidal activity was assayed and morphologic changes were monitored for selected strains exhibiting a large inoculum effect. MICs correlated with bactericidal activity at an inoculum level of 10(5) CFU/ml, while activity at 10(8) CFU/ml was variable. Cefoxitin demonstrated the least filamentous transformation and the most rapid bactericidal activity. Aztreonam showed the most marked filamentous transformation and was no longer bactericidal at 10(8) CFU/ml.

Teicoplanin-resistant U.S. isolates were usually Staphylococcus haemolyticus (1.8% of all tested strains), for which MICs ranged from 32 to greater than 128 micrograms/ml. MDL 62873 was not active against the Bacteroides fragilis group but was generally effective against gram-positive anaerobic strains.\r"

The median baseline SaO2 during regular breathing was 99.8% (range 97.0-100%). Fifty four infants (81%) had shortlived episodes during which SaO2 fell to 80% or less (desaturation); the median rate was 0.9 desaturations/hour, and the median duration of each desaturation was 1.2 seconds. The 97th centile value for the duration of all episodes in which SaO2 fell to less than or equal to 80% was 4.0 seconds. The frequency of desaturations was significantly higher, and their duration significantly longer, when the breathing pattern was non-regular rather than regular. The percentage of apnoeic pauses (greater than or equal to 4 seconds in duration) followed by a desaturation was higher during non-regular than regular breathing; it was particularly high during periodic breathing. A knowledge of normal variability of baseline measurements of oxygenation and of the relationship between oxygenation and breathing patterns in infants is essential to the use of pulse oximetry in clinical practice.\r"

No infant was given additional inspired oxygen during the study. The median baseline SaO2 was 99.4% (range 88.9-100%). Eight infants had baseline SaO2 values below 97%, the lowest value observed in a study on full term infants.

There was no evidence that gestational age at birth influenced the frequency or duration of desaturations among the preterm infants. The frequency of relatively prolonged episodes of desaturation (SaO2 less than or equal to 80% for greater than or equal to 4 seconds), however, decreased significantly with increasing gestational age (0.5, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 episodes/hour in infants at less than or equal to 32, 33-34, 35, and 36 weeks' gestational age, respectively). Analysis of the respiratory patterns associated with such episodes showed that 5% occurred despite both continued breathing movements and continuous airflow. Five infants had outlying recordings: three had baseline SaO2 values of less than 95% (88.9, 92.7, and 93.8%), and two had many prolonged desaturations (14 and 92/hour; median for total group 0.2, 95th centile 2.3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The response of the airways to exercise and provocation by methacholine were compared. In these children, who had symptoms but were not necessarily asthmatic, there was no significant correlation between the two stimuli. The atopic children were, however, significantly more responsive than the non-atopic children to both. For the whole group, odds ratios derived for atopy and for an increased response to methacholine (expressed as a PD20--the dose that caused the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to fall by 20%--of less than 6.4 mumol/l), a positive exercise test (greater than 15% fall in FEV1), and the presence of asthma were 13.5, 3.3, and 21.0, respectively; that for positive response to methacholine and positive exercise challenge was 1.5. Thus though increased bronchial responsiveness to methacholine and exercise challenge are both associated with a diagnosis of asthma, the association between the two stimuli is complex, and supports the view that they reflect entirely different components of airways dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of low birth weight on the incidence of asthma by 17 years of age was investigated by studying medical draft examination records of 20,312 male subjects born in Jerusalem between January 1967 and December 1971. Additional information on birth weight and other demographic factors was abstracted from the Jerusalem Perinatal Study computerised database. A stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios for developing asthma by 17 years of age in 500 g birthweight categories from less than 2000 g to 4500 g. The odds ratios were adjusted for the confounding effects of ethnic origin, social class (determined by area of residence), paternal education, maternal age, and birth order. The group with low birth weights (less than 2500 g, n = 1004) had a significantly increased risk of developing asthma by 17 years of age, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 2.66) for birthweight group less than 2000 g and 1.49 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.12) for birthweight group 2000-2499 g compared with the reference group of 3000-3499 g. We conclude that infants with birth weights of less than 2500 g may have a higher risk of asthma during childhood and adolescence than infants who were heavier at birth.\r"

Renal function was evaluated by determining the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) from the clearances of inulin and para-aminohippuric acid. Fifteen (29%) of the children had raised serum creatinine concentrations at the onset. Mean GFR was significantly lower than that of controls at the first investigation. During the follow up GFR and ERPF decreased and were significantly lower than in the controls after eight years of disease. The significant fall in renal function was found in children with proteinuria and especially in boys, in whom GFR and ERPF decreased from a mean (SEM) of 117 (5) and 616 (31) at 2.8 years to 97 (6) and 509 (36) ml/min/1.73 m2 at 7.5 years. Patients with raised serum creatinine concentrations at the onset had significantly lower GFRs, and patients with macroscopic haematuria at this time did not show decreased renal function at follow up. In conclusion, children with IgA nephropathy do not seem to have a benign clinical course. Boys with proteinuria show a significant decrease in renal function during follow up.\r"

For UPE albumin, IgG, beta 2 microglobulin, and creatinine were analysed. Glomerular global/segmental sclerosis and crescents in the biopsy specimens were assessed, and glomerular and tubulointerstitial changes classified on a five degree scale. The patients with tubulointerstitial or mesangial biopsy changes or glomerular sclerosis had significantly lower GFR than those without corresponding lesions. Patients with segmental sclerosis also had higher excretion rates of IgG, which increased with increasing segmental sclerosis. Six patients had GFRs below 2SD of the controls. Within the group of patients with reduced GFR overt albuminuria, a raised excretion rate of IgG, interstitial fibrosis, and advanced mesangial lesions were more frequent. A rising excretion rate of IgG seems to indicate both reduced GFR and increasing segmental glomerulosclerosis and may be a marker of progressive disease.\r"

Energy expenditure was assessed both by indirect ventilated hood calorimetry (resting energy expenditure) and the stable isotope doubly labelled water (2H2(18)O) technique (free living daily total energy expenditure). Mean increases in weight of 0.96 kg and fat free mass of 1.37 kg and a mean decrease in fat mass of 0.41 kg were observed. Significant increases both in resting energy expenditure and free living daily energy expenditure were detected. Absolute changes in fat mass and resting energy expenditure were correlated. The data suggest (i) that the increase in the fat free mass is the most significant early clinical measure of hGH response and (ii) that hGH increases the metabolic activity of the fat free mass. Monitoring such changes may be predictive of the efficacy of hGH in promoting growth.\r"

The male:female ratio was 1.4:1. The overall case fatality rate was 19.8% for neonates and 5.4% for postneonatal infants. Two thirds of deaths identified in the study, 50% of all deaths, were not attributed to meningitis by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Group B beta haemolytic streptococci (28%), Escherichia coli (18%), and Listeria monocytogenes (5%) were most frequently isolated from neonates and Neisseria meningitidis (31%), Haemophilus influenzae (30%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%) from postneonatal infants. At 2-6 months of age N meningitidis meningitis was most common, and at 7-12 months H influenzae predominated. Meningitis caused by group B beta haemolytic streptococci occurred up to 6 months of age and had a consistent mortality of 25%. Neonatal meningitis due to Gram negative enteric rods had a mortality of 32%. Low birth weight was a significant predisposing factor for both neonates and postneonatal infants. In both groups mortality was significantly higher among children admitted in coma. There was no seasonal variation in incidence in either group. Neonates were treated with either group. Neonates were treated with either chloramphenicol (50%) or gentamicin (48%) usually in combination with a penicillin; 40% received a third generation cephalosporin. Of the 1472 postneonatal infants treated 84% received chloramphenicol with a penicillin and 10% received a third generation cephalosporin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The cumulative incidence at 2 years of age/1000 liveborn infants increased significantly from 0.31 in the first birth cohort to 2.93 in the last. This increase could only partly be explained by improvements in detection. Weight for age at diagnosis was generally considerably below the reference value, but was slightly less affected towards the end of the period. The increase in incidence of coeliac disease is the first reported since the middle 1970s and makes the disease one of the most common chronic diseases among Swedish children.\r"

A total of 155 patients (74%) had normal glucose tolerance, 31 (15%) had impaired glucose tolerance, and 15 (7%) had diabetes mellitus according to the WHO criteria. The percentage of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (reference range 4.1-6.4%) increased significantly as glucose tolerance decreased: when glucose tolerance was normal the median was 5.2%; when it was impaired the figure was 5.5%; in patients whose diabetes was diagnosed by the oral glucose tolerance test it was 5.9%; and in patients already known to have diabetes mellitus it was 8.6%. The incidence and prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus increased with age. From the age of 15 to 30 years the decrease in the prevalence of normal glucose tolerance was almost linear. Within this age span the proportion of patients with cystic fibrosis with normal glucose tolerance was reduced by roughly 5%/year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These patients underwent combined recording of distal oesophageal motility and intraluminal pH in order to investigate mechanisms of GOR. Inappropriate lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation was the most common mechanism of reflux in all patients. Other mechanisms (appropriate relaxation or lowered pressure of the lower oesophageal sphincter, increased intragastric pressure) were detected less frequently. Frequency of inappropriate lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations was significantly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis than in other study groups (symptomatic GOR, GOR disease complicated by respiratory complaints). Inappropriate lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations occurred with the same frequency in patients with cystic fibrosis and in a group of children with GOR disease complicated by oesophagitis. Abnormalities of distal oesophageal contractions such as decreased amplitude or uncoordinated waves were also recorded in cystic fibrosis patients. Seven patients with cystic fibrosis completed a therapeutic trial for eight weeks consisting of postural treatment and oral cisapride, a new prokinetic drug. The oesophageal acid exposure improved in only three patients. We conclude that pathologic GOR is commonly associated with cystic fibrosis. The predominant reflux mechanism in these patients is a transient inappropriate lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation rather than a low steady state basal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure.\r"

Room temperature at night was significantly related to outside temperature and duration of heating. Total insulation was significantly related to outside temperature and to minimum room temperature, but there was wide variation in insulation at the same room temperature. High levels of insulation for a given room temperature were found particularly at night and in winter, and were associated with the use of thick or doubled duvets and with swaddling. At least half the babies threw off some or all of their bedding at night, and at least a quarter sweated. Younger mothers and mothers in the lower social groups put more bedclothes over their babies, and the latter also kept their rooms warmer. Many mothers kept their babies warmer during infections.\r"

Delay in diagnosis, both in terms of time (median 2.95 years) and number of consultations (median 7), was considerable. Annual rates of consultations for respiratory symptoms that were initiated by the patients fell significantly after diagnosis (median before = 1.80, after = 0.95 consultations/year), but the number initiated by the doctors rose significantly (median before = 0, after = 1.01 consultations/year). The overall rates before and after diagnosis were not significantly different (median before = 2.04, after = 2.21 consultations/year). Increased efforts are required to reduce this delay thereby minimising the morbidity of asthma in childhood.\r"

Statistically significant relationships were observed between TSP levels and forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1.0). These relationships remained strong across several specifications and sample changes, e.g., exclusion of cities with two highest and two lowest TSP levels, restriction of sample to whites only. Anthropometric measurements and socioeconomic characteristics of the subjects were included in the analysis, and we restricted the sample to \"never\" smokers. The results indicate a 1 standard deviation increase (about 34 micrograms/m3) in TSP from the sample mean of 87 micrograms/m3 was associated with an average decrease in FVC of 2.25%. The results of this analysis also suggest that there is a threshold level (i.e., approximately 60 micrograms/m3 [quarterly average]) of TSP below which a relationship with pulmonary function ceases to exist.\r"

The purpose of this study was to confirm or refute these findings by exposing 38 healthy young men to 0.08 ppm O3 for 6.6 h. During exposure, subjects performed exercise for a total of 5 h, which required a minute ventilation of 40 l/min. Significant O3-induced decrements were observed for forced vital capacity (FVC, -0.25 l), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0, -0.35 l), and mean expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75, -0.57 l/s), and significant increases were observed in airway reactivity (35%), specific airway resistance (0.77 cm H2O/s), and respiratory symptoms. These results essentially confirm previous findings. A large range in individual responses was noted (e.g., percentage change in FEV1.0; 4% increase to 38% decrease). Responses also appeared to be nonlinear in time under these experimental conditions.\r"

The New York State Department of Health responded by conducting a case history study of radiographic abnormalities found in the lung parenchyma and pleura of residents in Lawrence and Jefferson counties, where tremolitic talc has been mined for many years. During a 1-y period, all radiographs from 6 hospitals in the region were reviewed. A B-reader confirmed that 355 of 9,442 patients who were at least 40 y of age (3.8%) had a relevant abnormality; 60% of them reported occupational exposure to asbestiform minerals, and another 15% had a chest condition or injury that could have accounted for the abnormal radiograph. The results should be interpreted cautiously, but there was no evidence of widespread radiographic abnormalities resulting from ambient dust exposure. The data, however, support earlier studies that indicate that talc miners and millers experience excess parenchymal fibrosis and pleural changes. The data also suggest that individuals in the paper industry and construction trades may be at risk.\r"

Emergency room and hospital records of 939 persons who were seen at two area hospitals were reviewed. Most persons who presented at the emergency rooms were female (56%) or black (60%), and their mean age was 33.9 y. The most frequently reported symptoms were eye irritation (41.5%), burning throat (21%), headache (20.6%), and shortness of breath (19.4%). Physical examination results were normal for 49% of the cases; however, irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, skin, and lungs were noted on other exams. Decreased pulmonary function was demonstrated by pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume in the first second, less than 80% of predicted value, 42.3%); hypoxemia (pO2 less than 80 mm Hg, 17.4%) and hypocalcemia (less than 8.5 mg/dl, 16.3%) were also noted. Ninety-four (10%) of the cases were hospitalized, and more than 83% of all cases were discharged with a primary diagnosis of \"HF exposure.\" There are several reports of individuals who are acutely and chronically exposed to HF; however, we are unaware of other published reports that describe exposure of a community to HF. This incident represented a unique opportunity to study the immediate health impact on a community of residents who were exposed to a hazardous materials release. Results of this analysis suggest that (a) initial health problems should be followed up, (b) any long-term health effects of HF exposure must be assessed, and (c) the health impact on the population at risk should be determined.\r"

Medical examinations, liver function tests, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) determinations were performed on 183 of 204 (76%) employees of a synthetic leather factory. Air concentrations of solvents were measured with personal samplers and gas chromatography. The concentration of DMF in air to which each worker was exposed was categorized. High exposure concentrations of DMF (i.e., 25-60 ppm) were significantly associated with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (ALT greater than or equal to 35 IU/l), a result that did not change even after stratification by hepatitis B carrier status. Modeling by logistic regression demonstrated that exposure to high concentrations of DMF was associated with an elevated ALT (p = .01), whereas hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was slightly but independently associated with an elevated ALT (p = .07). In those workers who had normal ALT values, there occurred still significantly higher mean ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, especially among those who were not HBsAg carriers. A significant association existed between elevated CPK levels and exposure to DMF. However, an analysis of the CPK isoenzyme among 143 workers did not reveal any specific damage to muscles. This outbreak of liver injury among synthetic leather workers is ascribed to DMF. It is recommended that the occupational standard for DMF and its toxicity among HBsAg carriers be evaluated further.\r"

Historical ambient air lead levels were used as a qualitative surrogate of air and dust exposure. The area-specific cord blood means (all means approximately 5 micrograms/dl), medians, deciles, and distributions did not vary among locations. The California distributions included means that were lower than the 6.6 micrograms/dl reported in Needleman et al.'s Boston study in 1979. Indeed, the entire California distribution was shifted to the left of the Boston study distribution, even though 3% of the California cord lead levels exceeded 10 micrograms/dl--the level above which Needleman et al. have documented psychoneurological effects in children during the first few years of life. Fourteen percent of premature babies had cord blood lead levels above 10 micrograms/dl. The association between prematurity (i.e., less than 260 d gestation) and elevated (greater than 5 micrograms/dl) cord blood lead was observed in all hospitals and yielded a relative risk of 2.9 (95% CI: .9, 9.2) and a population attributable risk of 47%. Further research is needed to confirm this association and to explore the roles of endogenous and exogenous sources of lead exposure to the mothers who give birth to premature infants.\r"

Concentrations of TRI and PER in blood were analyzed, and concentrations of trichloroethanol (TCE) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in blood and urine were analyzed. Results varied widely: PER was found in the blood of workers in group 1, but TRI was not detected in blood from any worker in group 2; most blood samples from group 2 workers did not contain a detectable quantity of TCE, and urine TCE concentrations in this group were very low. During the work week, a significant difference was found in group 1 for TRI in blood and TCE in blood and urine. In group 2, however, the only significant difference during the work week was for PER in blood. Therefore, the most reliable biological indicators for TRI and PER exposure are TCE in blood and PER in blood, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "Pelvic hemorrhage has been implicated as the cause of death in 50% of patients who die following pelvic fractures. To establish correlates of morbidity and mortality from pelvic fractures due to blunt trauma, we reviewed 236 patients treated during 4 years. The average age of the 144 men and 92 women was 31.5 years, the average Injury Severity Score was 21.3, the average blood requirement was 5 units, and the average hospital stay was 16.8 days. One hundred fifty-two patients (64.4%) were injured in motor vehicle accidents, 33 (14%) had motor vehicle-pedestrian accidents, 16 (6.8%) had crush injuries, 12 (5.1%) each had either motorcycle accidents or falls, and 11 (4.6%) had miscellaneous accidents. Eighteen patients (7.6%) died, with seven (38.9%) deaths due to hemorrhage. Only one death was caused by pelvic hemorrhage. Other deaths were due to hemorrhage from other sites (6), head injury (5), sepsis or multiple-organ failure (4), pulmonary injury (1), and pulmonary embolus (1). None of the septic deaths was related to a pelvic hematoma. Multivariate multiple regression analysis showed that the severity of injury was correlated with indices of severity of pelvic fractures such as fracture site (p less than 0.0001), fracture displacement (p less than 0.005), pelvic stability (p less than 0.0001), and vector of injury (p less than 0.01). However death could not be predicted on the basis of these indices of severity (p greater than 0.28). Of the nine patients who underwent pelvic arteriography, three required embolization of actively bleeding pelvic vessels, but seven had intra-abdominal hemorrhage that required laparotomy, and eight developed a coagulopathy. Massive bleeding from pelvic fractures was uncommon, and the major threat of hemorrhage was from nonpelvic sites. Furthermore, although injury severity was correlated with the severity of the pelvic fracture, hospital outcome was determined by associated injuries and not by the pelvic fracture.\r"

  ".W": "During a 5-year period, 482 patients with liver injuries were studied prospectively: 65% resulted from penetrating and 35% from blunt injuries. The injuries were graded by the hepatic injury scale (grades I to VI); transfusion requirements and perihepatic abscesses correlated with increasing scores. Minor surgical techniques were needed in 338 patients and 144 patients required major techniques. Omental packing was used in 60% of the major injuries and yielded 7% mortality and 8% abscess rates. Gauze packs were used for management of 10% of major injuries and yielded 29% mortality and 30% abscess rates. The patients were randomized to no drain, closed suction, or sump drainage and respective perihepatic abscess rates were 6.7%, 3.5%, and 13% (p less than 0.03; suction compared to closed suction). Multivariate analysis demonstrated increasing abdominal trauma indices and transfusion requirements as well as sump drainage to be associated independently with perihepatic infection.\r"

  ".W": "Cell depolarization in hemorrhagic shock has been attributed to hypoperfusion, but the mechanism remains unclear. Suspensions of single cell lines loaded with the potential-sensitive fluorescent dye bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbiturioc acid) trimethine oxonal (DIBAC) and exposed for 30 minutes to rat plasma drawn either before or after hemorrhagic shock (bled 20 mL/kg: mean arterial blood pressure less than 40 mmHg) were studied. Plasma drawn after, but not before, hemorrhage led to partial depolarization regardless of cell type (rat H9C2 skeletal muscle, A-10 smooth muscle, C-9 liver, adrenal, kidney, red blood cell [RBC], white blood cell [WBC]) or species (cat, dog, pig RBC; cat WBC; mouse C2C12 skeletal muscle; and human intestinal smooth muscle [HISM]). Dialysis did not remove the factor(s), suggesting a molecular weight of more than 10,000 daltons. The factor appeared within 5 minutes of shock. The depolarization amplitude increased as a function of plasma concentration and demonstrated saturation kinetics indicating specific receptor binding. Cells were equivalently oxygenated, excluding hypoperfusion as a necessary condition for depolarization. Tumor necrosis factor or platelet activating factor alone or in combination were not effective in this system. Stable measurements can be obtained with this noninvasive system that avoids cell injury consequent to cell impalement with electrodes. This system provides a sensitive in vitro bioassay that should permit identification of the plasma factors mediating cell depolarization, as well as definition of the responsible intracellular mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The present investigation was performed to study the kinetics of tissue distribution and deposition of Escherichia coli and endotoxin translocating from the intestine after thermal injury. Escherichia coli was grown in the presence of 14C glucose and both labeled bacteria and endotoxin prepared from the labeled bacteria were used as translocation probes. Escherichia coli (10(8) to 10(10) bacteria) and E. coli endotoxin (100 micrograms per animal) were gavaged into the stomach immediately before a 30%  burn injury was inflicted in mice. Animals were killed 1, 4 and 24 hours after burn injury. Translocation occurred extensively within 1 hour after burn injury. Expressed as amount of radioactivity per gram of tissue, translocation was greatest in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) followed by spleen, lung, and liver. Translocation of endotoxin was similar to translocation of intact bacteria, with the exception that less radioactivity could be found in the peritoneal cavity and more in the liver. Both intact E. coli and endotoxin translocated directly through the intact bowel wall. Killing of bacteria was greatest in the MLN and spleen, approximating 95% to more than 99% of translocating bacteria. Killing efficiency was lowest in the lungs. It is concluded that estimation of translocation by viable bacterial counts in tissues grossly underestimates the extent of translocation of bacteria and ignores the extent of translocation of endotoxin. Translocation of endotoxin may have biologic significance that is independent of and in addition to translocation of intact bacteria.\r"

To examine how these alterations in cardiac performance affect peripheral perfusion, indirect calorimetry and leg blood flow were measured before and then after a 2-hour intravenous propranolol infusion. Five severely burned patients (55% + 7% total burn surface area), given propranolol at 8 micrograms/kg/minute, had a significant reduction in cardiac index and heart rate with an increased leg vascular resistance resulting in a decrease in extremity perfusion. Four healthy volunteers were given propranolol at 5 micrograms/kg/minute, resulting in a comparable decrease in heart rate, yet there was no change in leg vascular resistance or extremity perfusion. In both patient groups, propranolol decreased the plasma lactate concentration. This suggests that in hypermetabolic patients, beta adrenergic blockade reduces peripheral perfusion and that peripheral perfusion is not a principal determinate of plasma lactate levels. Rather adrenergic blockade appears to decrease lactate concentration as a consequence of the inhibition of lipolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Death and the incidence of pneumonia are significantly increased in burn patients with inhalation injury, despite application of conventional ventilatory support techniques. The effect of high-frequency percussive ventilation on mortality rate, incidence of pulmonary infection, and barotrauma were studied in 54 burn patients with documented inhalation injury admitted between March 1987 and September 1990 as compared to an historic cohort treated between 1980 and 1984. All patients satisfied clinical criteria for mechanical ventilation. High-frequency percussive ventilation was initiated within 24 hours of intubation. The patients' mean age and burn size were 32.2 years and 47.8%, respectively (ranges, 15 to 88 years; 0% to 90%). The mean number of ventilator days was 15.3 +/- 16.7 (range, 1 to 150 days), with 26% of patients ventilated for more than 2 weeks. Fourteen patients (25.9%) developed pneumonia compared to an historic frequency of 45.8% (p less than 0.005). Mortality rate was 18.5% (10 patients) with an expected historic number of deaths of 23 (95% confidence limits of 17 to 28 deaths). The documented improvement in survival rate and decrease in the incidence of pneumonia in patients treated with prophylactic high-frequency ventilation (HFV), as compared to a cohort of patients treated in the 7 years before the trial, indicates the importance of small airway patency in the pathogenesis of inhalation injury sequelae and supports further use and evaluation of HFV.\r"

  ".W": "During an 11.5-year period, 100 consecutive patients (79 male, 21 female) underwent repair of an infected sternotomy wound. Sixty-five patients had failed attempts at wound closure by other physicians. Median age was 61.5 years (range, 5 to 85 years). Reconstruction included muscle in 79 patients, omentum in 4, and both in 15. A total of 175 muscles were transposed, including 169 pectoralis major, 3 rectus abdominis, 2 external oblique, and 1 latissimus dorsi. Median number of operations was four (range, 1 to 11). Mechanical ventilation was required in 30 patients. Two perioperative deaths occurred, one related to sepsis. Median follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 1.3 to 13.5 years). Twenty-six patients had recurrent infection. Median time from our closure to recurrence was 5.5 months (range, 0.3 to 27.6 months). Cause of recurrence was inadequate removal of cartilage in 16 patients, bone in 6, and retained foreign body in 4. Eighteen patients had the wound reopened with further resection; 10 had another muscle or omentum transposition. There were 30 late deaths, only one related to recurrent infection. At the time of death or last follow-up, 92 patients had a healed chest wall. Transposition of the pectoralis major muscle remains an excellent method of management for infected sternotomy wounds. Failure is directly related to persistent infection of cartilage, bone, or retained foreign bodies.\r"

The HLA class I and class II antigens each exhibited approximate molecular weights of 50,000 to 60,000 daltons by chromatography on Sepharose CL 6B. Class I antigens in serum and PD fluid were associated with B2M. Free B2M (Mr 11,500) also was detected in both sera and PD fluids. Unlike class I antigens, class II antigens were not found to have attached B2M. Class I and class II antigens eluted from 2-diethylaminoethanol ion exchange gradient columns at 0.07 mol/L (molar) phosphate buffer pH 7.2 and migrated with alpha 2-beta 1 mobility in agarose electrophoresis. Class I antigens were purified from ESRD patients' PD fluid by solid-phase immunoaffinity chromatography. Enzyme-linked immunoassay demonstrated that this purified protein was composed of a class I heavy chain and B2M. Class I allospecificity was confirmed by neutralization on known HLA typing antisera in a microcytotoxicity assay. Soluble HLA class I antigen preparations specifically inhibited blast transformation of responder lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte culture reactions. Inhibition was dose dependent and ranged from 0% to 95%. The presence of soluble HLA antigens in body fluids may play an important part in the immunologic tolerance to self. This study demonstrates a ready source of large quantities of soluble HLA for detailed analysis.\r"

  ".W": "The use of mammography has resulted in 1464 breast biopsies for nonpalpable abnormalities at the University of Virginia in the 10 years 1980 to 1989. Two hundred sixty-four cancerous lesions (18%) were found. One hundred seventy-eight of these (67%) were in situ lesions. Invasive cancer (86 of 264 lesions or 33%) forms the basis for this report. Mammographic findings leading to biopsy were a mass in 61 of 86 cases (71%), microcalcifications in 23 of 86 (27%), or both in 2 of 86 cases. Histologic subtypes were infiltrating ductal (63 of 86), infiltrating lobular (14 of 86), and other infiltrating (9 of 86). Mastectomy was performed in 71 of 86 lesions (82%), lumpectomy/radiation in 14 of 86 (16%), and lumpectomy alone in 1 of 86 lesions. Division of the tumors into size with nodal status revealed 19 of 86 lesions (22%) less than 0.5 cm with 0 of 14 positive nodes. Thirty-nine of eighty-six lesions (46%) measured 0.6 to 1.0 cm with 10 (26%) positive nodes. Twenty-eight of eighty-six lesions (32%) measured more than 1.0 cm with 8 of 28 (28%) positive nodes. Nodal status is unknown for eight patients. Overall 18 of 78 lesions (23%) had positive nodes. Median follow-up is 44 months. Disease-free survival rate is 92% (79 of 86 patients) and overall survival rate is 94% (81 of 86 patients). Six of seven recurrences occurred in node-positive patients. For those with negative or unknown nodes, the disease-free survival rate is 98% (67 of 68 patients). These findings emphasize the benefit of early detection of breast cancer through the use of mammography.\r"

During the same time, an additional four patients required a standard ileonal procedure. The results of anal manometry and clinical function were compared to 25 patients who had previously undergone mucosal stripping and a sutured J pouch ileoanal anastomoses with a temporary diverting ileostomy between October 1982 and August 1990. During this same time period, an additional 19 patients underwent an anti-peristaltic reversed J pouch and 18 an S pouch, for a total of 83 ileoanal procedures. The reversed J pouch had a lower stool frequency than a standard J pouch but had an unacceptable incidence of complications and problems with pouch emptying. The S pouch had a stool frequency similar to the standard J pouch but provided greater length in patients with a short mesentery. Stapled J pouch ileoanal patients had a better (p less than 0.02) maximum and sphincter resting pressure (46 +/- 11 versus 34 +/- 12 mmHg), fewer (p less than 0.05) night-time accidents (22% versus 68%), daytime (17% versus 55%) or night-time (28 versus 61%) spotting, or use of a protective pad at night (11% versus 42%) than nonstapled J pouch ileoanal patients. Stool frequency was similar in the two groups. All but one UC patient had residual disease at the anastomosis. Anal mucosa between the dentate line and stapled anastomosis was 1.8 +/- 1.3 cm (range, 0 to 3.5 cm). Complications in the nonstapled J pouch group included 4 pouches excised (2 for complications, 2 for excessive stool frequency), 1 pelvic abscess, 2 stenosis requiring dilation under anesthesia, 1 enterocutaneous fistula after ileostomy closure, 1 ileostomy site hernia, and 2 small bowel obstructions. Of the 65 patients who underwent ileostomy closure in the entire series, 8 (12%) developed a complication requiring surgical intervention. Complications in the stapled group included 1 anastomotic leak, 1 pouch leak, and 1 pelvic abscess. Patients were managed successfully with drainage (all 3) and diverting ileostomy (1). One patient developed stenosis requiring dilation under anesthesia. The stapled J pouch ileoanal anastomosis is a simpler, safer procedure with less tension than a standard handsewn J pouch but leaves a very small cuff of residual disease. It provides significantly better stool control and may obviate the need for an ileostomy with its complications.\r"

In the past decade, our experience has grown to more than 1000 procedures. An excellent surgical result requires careful case selection, avoiding cases with thin or rigid ventral parameatal skin or a meatus too proximal or too wide. The glans wrap to support the advanced ventral urethral wall requires a solid tissue approximation in two layers to prevent a retrusive meatus. Meatal stenosis can be avoided by assuring an adequate dorsal Heineke-Mikulicz tissue rearrangement and making an incision from within the urethral meatus well distally into the urethral groove. The MAGPI procedure routinely is performed on an outpatient basis without any urinary diversion. Our experience in 1111 cases during 12 years has required a second procedure in 1.2% of cases. The overall success rate with the MAGPI procedure suggests that it should continue to be used in the repair of distal hypospadias.\r"

Three patients in each group had residual stones at the completion of the operation. Five of these six had more than 20 common bile duct (CBD) stones. There was one episode of major hemorrhage in a patient in each group and no deaths. Costs were essentially equal for the individual patient with a successful ES as compared to SA. Societal costs of a program of preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and ES would be higher because of the cost of screening for patients with CBD stones. These results do not support preoperative ES as a technique for clearance of the CBD of stones on the basis of efficacy, morbidity rate, or cost.\r"

From 1968 to 1984, 134 patients underwent CDD. Eight patients (6%) died in the immediate postoperative period, 55 left the hospital, 8 of them were lost to follow-up, and 47 were followed but died before 5 years elapsed after CDD. The remaining 71 patients form the data base for this analysis: 38 were followed for more than 5 years, 25 were followed for more than 10 years, and 8 were followed for more than 15 years (mean 12.1 years +/- 1.3 SEM). Choledocholithiasis, chronic pancreatitis, and postoperative stricture were the indications for CDD. Cholangitis was observed in only three patients. The diameter of the common bile duct (CBD) was large in most patients (mean 18 mm +/- 0.9 SEM). These results infer that CDD is effective to treat non-neoplastic obstructing lesions of the distal CBD on a long-term basis and that the presence of a dilated CBD (more than 16 mm) that allows the construction of a CDD more than 14 mm is essential to obtain good results.\r"

  ".W": "Gallstone lithotripsy (LITHO) was performed on 52 patients who underwent 107 procedures. Two hundred sixty-seven gallstone patients were screened and 215 (81%) were excluded. Excessive stone burden and nonvisualization by oral cholecystogram (OCG) were the most common reasons for exclusion. The hospital course of 100 excluded patients who later underwent elective cholecystectomy was evaluated for length of hospital stay (2.3 days) and total cost of treatment ($3685.00). Successful fragmentation to less than 5 mm was achieved in 43 LITHO patients (83%). Five LITHO patients (10%) required conversion to operative management. Complications of LITHO included acute cholecystitis (1 of 52 patients) and biliary colic (17 of 52 patients, or 33%). Multiple procedures in one patient were common. Costs for LITHO were calculated in two ways: first the individual cost for each of the 52 candidates; second the cost for successful LITHO was calculated by excluding five patients who required operation as well as five patients (10%) who are predicted failures of LITHO. Including the preoperative evaluation, treatment, recovery room, and follow-up, the individual LITHO cost for 52 patients was $8275.00. If the same total expenditure is calculated after excluding patients who required operation and those predicted to fail, the cost per 'successful' LITHO procedure was $10,245. The cost of 1 year of bile acid therapy is $1949.00 or $2413.00 per 'successful' procedure. Follow-up costs were $1232.00 per patient or $1525.00 per 'successful' procedure. The added LITHO cost incurred by screening eventual noncandidates was $904.00 per successful procedure. The sum of these individual costs was $15,087.00 per success, as compared to $3685.00 for cholecystectomy. No allowance was made for cost of stone recurrence. Lithotripsy costs appear to be sufficiently high to render the procedure unlikely to emerge as the treatment of choice.\r"

  ".W": "Upper abdominal surgery is associated with characteristic changes in pulmonary function which increase the risk of lower lobe atelectasis. Sixteen patients undergoing open cholecystectomy and 20 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were prospectively evaluated by pulmonary function tests (forced vital capacity [FVC], forced expiratory volume [FEV-1], and forced expiratory flow [FEF] 25% to 75%) before operation and on the morning after surgery to determine if the laparoscopic technique lessens the pulmonary risk. Fraction of the baseline pulmonary function was calculated by dividing the postoperative pulmonary function by the preoperative pulmonary function and multiplying by 100%. Postoperative FVC measured 52% of preoperative function for open cholecystectomy and 73% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (p = 0.002). Postoperative FEV-1 measured 53% of baseline function for open cholecystectomy and 72% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (p = 0.006). Postoperative FEF 25% to 75% measured 53% for open cholecystectomy and 81% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (p = 0.07). It is concluded that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offers improved pulmonary function compared to the open technique.\r"

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy boasts two major advantages over the conventional procedure: the remarkable reduction in postoperative pain and economic benefit, largely due to the patient's early return to work. Revealing a complication rate of 2% and no deaths, this study has shown that this procedure can offer patients these advantages with a medical risk no greater than that accompanying conventional cholecystectomy. Patient safety must be paramount, and it is the responsibility of the surgical community to ensure that all surgeons receive the highest quality training and that the technique is applied appropriately.\r"

  ".W": "Our initial experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for symptomatic cholelithiasis has involved 152 patients. Patient age ranged from 17 to 83 years; most were female (78%). Their average weight was 170 pounds (range, 75 to 365 lbs.). Twenty-two per cent had a single gallstone, while 9% had two to three stones and 64% had more than three stones. Exclusion criteria initially included upper abdominal scarring, severe acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and inability to tolerate general anesthesia. The first two of these are now only relative contraindications with increased experience. Thirteen of the one hundred fifty-two procedures (8.5%) required conversion to an open operation. Average time of operation was 138 minutes. Intraoperative cholangiography was attempted in 78% of cases and was completed successfully in 66% of those attempted. There have been no deaths. The complication rate has been low: 4% major, 0% life-threatening, and 7.2% minor complications. Postoperative analgesic requirements are remarkably low: 36% of patients required no narcotics after leaving the recovery room. Eighty-seven per cent of patients successfully undergoing LC were discharged by the first postoperative day. Most patients resumed normal activities within 1 week after discharge. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy offers the majority of patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis an improved treatment option, resulting in significantly less postoperative pain, hospitalization, and recuperation time.\r"

Preoperatively, 8 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I, 43 in class II, 18 in class III, and 4 in class IV. Of the 73 patients, 62 had localized SVAS and 11 (15%), diffuse SVAS. For all procedures, patients were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Those with localized SVAS were successfully treated with patch aortoplasty, whereas those with diffuse SVAS required either an apicoaortic conduit or extensive end-arterectomy with extended patch aortoplasty. There were eight early deaths (less than or equal to 30 days postoperatively) (11%) and four late deaths (greater than 30 days postoperatively) (6%) in a follow-up period ranging from 2 months to 28 years. Sixteen patients (25%) underwent one or more additional operations in the follow-up period. Postoperatively, there were 44 patients in New York Heart Association functional class I and 17 in class II. Preoperative functional class III and class IV (p less than 0.0005), diffuse SVAS (p = 0.05), and the presence of associated congenital defects (p less than 0.01) were important determinants of death.\r"

Preliminary procedures may improve Fontan results. The hemi-Fontan operation includes atriopulmonary anastomosis and correction of all anatomical risk factors, but an atriopulmonary patch directs superior vena caval flow into both pulmonary arteries and inferior vena caval flow into the ventricle, thus maintaining cardiac output (modified Glenn physiology). We performed 17 hemi-Fontan procedures in 16 patients, 14 primarily (median age, 9 months) and 3 for takedown of a Fontan operation. The 14 primary operations were for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (5), pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (4), and other (5). All patients had multiple risk factors. Extubation was at 18 hours (median), chest tube removal was at 3 days, and hospital discharge was at 8 days postoperatively. Important complications included subglottic stenosis, transient diaphragmatic paralysis, pulmonary artery stenosis and thrombosis requiring reoperation, and transient ventricular fibrillation. One patient required hemi-Fontan takedown, and this patient later (3 months postoperatively) became the only death. Fontan take-downs have had a high mortality rate. In 3 patients who tolerated Fontan operation poorly, converting Fontan to hemi-Fontan abruptly reversed the downhill course. For these patients, the operation was life-saving. Hemi-Fontan operation is safe and well-tolerated, even in infants, provides the advantages of modified Glenn physiology before Fontan operation, and may be especially useful for Fontan takedown after failed Fontan.\r"

Cadavers were selected so that closures depended only on the material used and not on any clot reinforcing the closure lines. The results of the study suggest that staple closure of the pulmonary artery and the main bronchus is as secure as suture closure. Pulmonary veins leak at a lower pressure when closed with staples; however, this pressure far exceeds physiological pressures in the left atrium. The data also suggest that the pig is an appropriate model for approximating conditions found in patients and is a good model for chronic studies comparing suture and staple closures.\r"

Moreover, there is no uniform approach to treating such patients, and the benefits of postoperative chemotherapy are unclear. Between 1964 and 1989, 21 patients with primary cardiac sarcomas underwent surgical resection alone (n = 7), chemotherapy alone (n = 1), or combined operation and postoperative chemotherapy based on adriamycin (n = 13). Twenty-four operations were performed on 20 patients with relief of symptoms in all. Eleven patients had complete resection. Operative mortality was 8.3% (2/24). Histology and originating chamber(s) included angiosarcoma (n = 7; 6/7 in right atrium, 1 in left atrium), malignant fibrous histocytoma (7; all in left atrium), fibrosarcoma (2; 2/2 in left atrium), rhabdomyosarcoma (2; 1 in left atrium, 1 in right ventricle), leiomyosarcoma (2; 1 in left atrium, 1 in left ventricle); and one undifferentiated sarcoma (right atrium). Overall actuarial survival was 14% at 24 months after resection. Patients with complete resection had a median survival of 24 months compared with only 10 months in all other patients (p = 0.035). Postoperative chemotherapy did not enhance survival in patients with incomplete resection. At this time, aggressive and complete surgical resection seems to offer the best hope for palliation and survival in an otherwise fatal disease.\r"

Oxygen-derived free radicals after reperfusion of an ischemic spinal cord may be partly responsible for neuronal destruction. We studied the effects of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), a free radical scavenger, as a way of increasing spinal cord tolerance to ischemia. Thirty rabbits underwent 40 minutes of aortic occlusion (a known model of paraplegia). Ten of these animals received 25,000 U/kg of PEG-SOD 24 hours before aortic occlusion and two additional doses of 10,000 U/kg, one before and one subsequent to spinal ischemia. Ten animals received superoxide dismutase in the same dosages as those receiving PEG-SOD. Ten control animals received placebo. All animals were studied for 96 hours, at which time a final neurological examination was performed and the results were recorded. Of the 10 animals treated with PEG-SOD, 2 were completely paralyzed whereas 8 had less (7) or no (1) neurological impairment. Eight of the 10 control animals and 9 of the 10 animals receiving superoxide dismutase were completely paralyzed. None of the control animals or animals receiving superoxide dismutase had a normal neurological examination (p less than or equal to 0.05). Treatment with PEG-SOD before and during occlusion increased the rabbit spinal cord tolerance to a 40-minute ischemic insult. Scavenging free radicals may lessen experimental spinal cord injury.\r"

Cause of mitral valve disease and severity of mitral regurgitation have been reported as related to mortality. To study the correlation of the cause of mitral valve disease and severity of mitral regurgitation to hospital mortality and long-term survival, we analyzed the results of 135 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting between June 1974 and August 1989. The hospital mortality was 11.8% (16/135). Fifteen preoperative and operative variables were tested for correlation with hospital or late mortality using univariate tests and multivariate regression. Advanced age (greater than 60 years), New York Heart Association functional class, and wall motion score were independently associated with hospital mortality (p less than 0.05). The cause of mitral valve disease and severity of mitral regurgitation were not related to hospital mortality or long-term survival (p greater than 0.05). The follow-up rate was 96.6% for the hospital survivors (115/119). Mean follow-up was 52.6 +/- 4.1 months. There were 35 late deaths. Survival was 91.9%, 89.9%, 78%, and 49.9% at 1, 2, 5, and 10 postoperative years, respectively. Preoperative New York Heart Association functional class and use of catecholamines during the postoperative intensive care period were independently related to late survival (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The subjects were 80 male patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary artery bypass grafting. Forty patients received aprotinin and 40 patients served as placebo controls. Aprotinin (4 x 10(6) KIU) was given as a continuous infusion, starting before operation and continuing until after cardiopulmonary bypass; additionally, 2 x 10(6) KIU aprotinin was added to the pump prime. Intraoperative and postoperative bleeding, respectively two thirds and one third of the total perioperative blood loss, were both significantly reduced in the aprotinin-treated group (p less than 0.01). The total average perioperative blood loss, corrected to a hemoglobin concentration of 7 mmol/L, was 550 mL in the aprotinin-treated patients versus 900 mL in the control patients. This reduction in blood loss, furthermore, significantly decreased the amount of postoperative blood transfusions (p less than 0.05) and increased the percentage of patients who did not receive postoperative donor blood from 42% to 68%. Aprotinin increased the activated clotting time significantly during cardiopulmonary bypass, which led to a reduction in heparin usage. The improved hemostasis during operation, despite the prolonged activated clotting time, might even abolish the need for heparin conversion with protamine at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, thus allowing retransfusion through cardiotomy suction to be continued, which saves the blood that is currently lost with vacuum suction.\r"

This study compared CP-A with other methods of cerebral protection during hypothermic circulatory arrest to assess the clinical utility of this technique. Twenty-three sheep were divided into four groups: systemic hypothermia alone (SYST) and systemic hypothermia combined with external cranial cooling (EXTNL), retrograde cerebroplegia (CP-R), or CP-A. Cardiopulmonary bypass was started, and the sheep were cooled to 15 degrees C and subjected to 2 hours of circulatory arrest. Cardiopulmonary bypass was restarted, and the animals were rewarmed and weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. Serial neurological examinations were performed and hourly scores assigned until the animals were extubated. Postanesthetic neurological scores improved in all groups throughout the 6-hour recovery period except the CP-R group. The improvement over time for these scores was similar for the EXTNL and CP-A groups and significantly better than for the SYST or CP-R groups (p = 0.004). The CP-A group had 5 of 7 animals with deficit-free survival despite the similarity in recovery of baseline brainstem function. We conclude that both antegrade infusion of cerebroplegia and external cranial cooling confer distinct cerebroprotective effects after a protracted period of hypothermic circulatory arrest when compared with the other methods studied.\r"

There were no wound infections in the one-dose group and two in the six-dose group (95% confidence intervals [CI]: -0.008, +0.048 [The positive number refers to the largest possible difference in favor of the one-dose group and the negative number, the largest possible difference in favor of the six-dose group]).

Thirty-day mortality was 5% in the one-dose group and 4% in the six-dose group (CI: -0.053, +0.069). Postoperative duration of hospital stay, requirement for antibiotics, and the need for reoperation were comparable.

We investigated the effect of intrathecal tetracaine on the neurological sequelae of spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion with aortic occlusion. Cocaine-derived anesthetics (lidocaine and its analogues) have been shown to decrease neuronal cell metabolism and also have specific neuronal membrane stabilizing effects. New Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized and spinal cord ischemia was then induced by infrarenal aortic occlusion. Animals were divided into six treatment groups. Tetracaine (groups 2 and 4) or normal saline solution (group 5) was administered intrathecally before aortic cross-clamping. Groups 1 and 3 functioned as controls. Group 6 animals received intravenous thiopental. Rabbits were classified as either neurologically normal or injured (paralyzed or paretic). Among controls, 25 minutes of aortic occlusion produced varied neurological sequelae (group 1, 3/6 injured, 50%) whereas 30 minutes resulted in more consistent injury (group 3, 5/6 injured, 83%). All rabbits that received intrathecal saline solution were paralyzed (group 5, 4/4 injured, 100%). Animals treated with intrathecal tetracaine and aortic occlusion of 30 minutes (group 4) showed significantly better preservation of neurological function (6/7 normal, 86%) than controls and saline-treated animals (groups 3 and 5). All animals treated with intrathecal tetracaine and aortic occlusion for 25 minutes (group 2) showed no signs of injury (5/5 normal, 100%), but this was not significant versus controls (group 1). Intravenous thiopental (group 6, 5/5 injured, 100%) had no beneficial effect. Intrathecal tetracaine significantly and dramatically abrogated the neurological injury secondary to spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion after aortic occlusion at 30 minutes in the rabbit model.\r"

Nine continued to have 1+ or less AI, based on echocardiography or catheterization (n = 6) or on physical examination performed at a mean of 74 months.

The ventricular septal defect was closed with a patch, and an aortic or pulmonary homograft (size, 8 to 24 mm) was interposed between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. Two of the 8 infants operated on died; there was one late death. All 14 older children survived the operation. All survivors are well up to 7 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 3.6 years). We recommend early treatment of infants; older children can be treated electively. The technique used in our series gives excellent results.\r"

Sixty-six percent were male. Preoperatively, 115 patients (73%) were in New York Heart Association functional class IV, with the remainder being in either class III (23%) or class II (4%). Twenty percent of the patients had major complications including postoperative hemorrhage (15), sepsis (9), cerebrovascular accident (6), third-degree heart block (5), renal failure requiring dialysis (1), and pulmonary embolism (1). The 30-day or in-hospital mortality rate was 7.0%. Mean total hospital stay was 26.1 +/- 17.9 days. One-year and 5-year actuarial survival rates were 85% and 62%, respectively. Higher mortality was seen to be associated with New York Heart Association class IV, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.40, and lesser values for cardiac output and cardiac index. At the 6-month postoperative follow-up, 73% of the survivors reported that their general health had improved as compared with before operation. This experience demonstrates that for select octogenarians with unmanageable angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass grafting is an effective therapeutic option.\r"

Further, this operation might beneficially alter the hemodynamic milieu of heart failure such that the arrhythmias are ameliorated. Described is our experience with 4 patients with heart failure receiving heterotopic cardiac allografts, documenting changes in native heart arrhythmia that occurred. These cases demonstrate that heterotopic grafts can adequately sustain hemodynamics during malignant native heart dysrhythmia.

Using this technique, 83 women and 21 children were operated on with no early or late complications and with good cosmetic results up to 9 years after operation. This technique prevents formation of visible wide scars above the breast in women and prevents thinning or disruption of the chest incision in children. Ages of the women ranged from 19 to 56 years; children, 5 to 18 years. In 23 patients, this technique was used after wound complications had occurred 7 days to 3 years after use of the standard implantation technique.\r"

Plasma cortisol levels decreased significantly from pretreatment to immediately posttreatment, and they declined further during the first week after the ECT course, when patients remained drug free. Plasma dexamethasone levels showed an opposite pattern of progressive increases over these three time points. The progressive changes in plasma dexamethasone and cortisol levels seen during the week after ECT indicate that alterations in the bioavailability of dexamethasone and in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function may be incomplete immediately after the ECT course. This may partly account for previous inconsistencies in serial dexamethasone suppression test findings with this treatment modality. The major finding was that clinical response was associated with increased plasma dexamethasone levels, whereas changes in cortisol levels were independent of clinical outcome. With ECT, changes in plasma dexamethasone levels may be more related to changes in clinical state than changes in postdexamethasone cortisol levels. The extent to which clinical recovery with other treatments in depression is associated with altered bioavailability of dexamethasone and perhaps other compounds is unknown and in need of investigation.\r"

Twelve patients and 22 controls received a single dose of ipsapirone, 0.3 mg/kg, or placebo under double-blind, random assignment conditions. Ipsapirone induced hypothermia and release of corticotropin and cortisol but had no effect on behavior, including obsessive or compulsive symptoms. Thermoregulatory and neuroendocrine responses to ipsapirone were not consistently different between healthy controls and patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. These results provide no direct support for the hypothesis that a serotonergic dysfunction related to 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptors may be linked to the pathophysiologic characteristics of obsessive-compulsive disorder and point to the need for the evaluation of other 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor subtypes. Future studies of the responsivity of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptors to direct-acting ligands, such as ipsapirone, should facilitate assessment of the integrity of the 5-hydroxytryptamine system and its involvement in antiobsessional drug effects.\r"

Retrospectively, all but two of these patients met DSM-III-R criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Six patients were deceased; four by suicide. Questionnaires were sent to the remaining 27 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder; 17 patients returned the questionnaire and another agreed to an interview without completing the forms. Sixteen of these 18 patients participated in a telephone interview, and patient reports were corroborated by an informant in 10 cases. Despite the presence of some side effects, such as easily controlled seizures (9%) and transient mania (6%), the results of this investigation support the use of cingulotomy as a potentially effective treatment for patients with severe and disabling obsessive-compulsive disorder. With the use of very conservative criteria, we estimated that at least 25% to 30% of the patients benefited substantially from this procedure. Similar results were found in a preliminary prospective study of four patients who recently underwent cingulotomy after state-of-the-art preoperative treatments had failed.\r"

Elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid may indicate increased serotonin activity. Such activity could contribute to pathological feeding behavior. Most importantly, this study raises the question as to whether increased cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels are associated with overly inhibited, anxious, or obsessive traits.\r"

Of the 27 malignant lesions, 10 were low- or intermediate-grade sarcomas, and 17 were high-grade sarcomas. In the malignant lesions, the DNA ploidy was correlated with the histologic grade and the clinical outcome. Of the 11 benign lesions, six had a diploid DNA ploidy pattern, and five were nondiploid by either flow cytometry or image cytometry. All benign cases had a favorable outocome regardless of ploidy. Eight of the 10 low- or intermediate-grade malignant lesions were diploid, whereas two were nondiploid. Of the 17 high-grade sarcomas, 15 were nondiploid by either method of measurement and nine by both. Of the 10 diploid malignant tumors, only one had an unfavorable outcome (malignant mesothelioma with biopsy only), whereas of the 17 malignant lesions that were nondiploid, five had no evidence of recurrent disease, three cases recurred, eight patients died of disease, and one patient died of an unrelated cause. We concluded that (1) ploidy does not differentiate benign from malignant spindle cell soft-tissue tumors, (2) the nondiploid DNA pattern is more common in high-grade than in low- or intermediate-grade sarcomas, and (3) there is a statistically significant relationship between nondiploidy and a worse clinical outcome in sarcomas.\r"

Two serous cystadenomas were aneuploid, with the remaining five serous and all three mucinous being diploid. All cases had a low S phase (ranging from 0.1% to 3.1%), indicating neoplasms with a low turnover. From these results, it appeared that DNA flow cytometry as an independent factor did not discriminate between the benign pancreatic serous cystadenomas and the more aggressive mucinous cystic neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "The application of immunohistochemical markers against epithelial antigens has proved useful for studying tumor differentiation and in aiding tumor diagnosis. However, the reactivity of various epithelial markers with poorly differentiated carcinomas (the situation in which they are most often used) has not been well established. As a result, it is unclear how negative results should be interpreted and how often more than one antibody may be needed to document the epithelial nature of poorly differentiated neoplasms. We studied 98 poorly differentiated epithelial tumors with AE1, CAM 5.2, and EMA to assess the use of these markers in their diagnosis. Both CAM 5.2 and EMA provided support for epithelial differentiation in 71% (70/98) of the cases, while AE1 stained 50% (49/98) of the tumors; CAM 5.2 was the single most useful marker in the subset of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, staining 20 (77%) of 26 tumors. Use of these markers in pairs increased the recognition of epithelial differentiation (at least one marker showing positive staining) as follows: AE1/CAM 5.2, 80% (78/98); AE1/EMA, 87% (85/98); and CAM 5.2/EMA, 99% (97/98). Thirty carcinomas stained with all three markers, 34 with two markers, and in 34 cases only one antibody supported epithelial differentiation. Twelve (21%) of 58 tumors showed evidence of S100 reactivity. None of the 71 cases to which PD7 was applied showed staining This study indicates that poorly differentiated carcinomas are heterogeneous in their expression of antigens recognized by AE1, CAM 5.2, and EMA. Moreover, these results quantitate the probability of reactivity with poorly differentiated carcinomas for each marker and support the use of one or more antibodies in a \"backup\" panel when a negative result is obtained with a single antibody and the diagnosis of carcinoma is still suspected.\r"

Similar symptoms were experienced by all of these patients, although those with malignant tumors lost the most weight. Loss of border definition, ascites, and liver metastases were the only radiologic clues to malignancy. Each entity had distinguishing cytologic features.

As such, differential diagnosis between MA and tubular carcinoma may be challenging in selected cases. A panel of antibodies was applied to 10 cases of MA and 10 of tubular carcinoma to investigate the potential benefit of immunohistochemistry in the separation of these lesions and the possible role of myoepithelial cells in MA. The luminal cells in nine cases of MA were surrounded by a cuff of muscle-specific actin-reactive cells, which also coexpressed cytokeratin and vimentin. The immunophenotype of these cells is characteristic of myoepithelial differentiation, which was heretofore thought to be lacking in MA. This finding demonstrates that myoepithelial cells are indeed present in MA subjacent to luminal epithelial cells; moreover, it distinghuishes MA from tubular carcinoma, all examples of which were actin negative in this analysis. In addition, circumferential type IV collagen deposition was observed around constituent glands of MA in nine cases but was lacking in all tubular carcinomas. Other markers included in this evaluation (S100 protein, gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, carcinoembryonic antigen, estrogen receptor protein) were of no differential diagnostic value.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the histologic, immunohistochemical, and clinical features of a series of 23 endometrial, five cervical, and one ovarian carcinosarcomas (malignant mixed mullerian [mesodermal] tumors) and nine associated distant peritoneal metastases. The primary tumors all showed epithelial differentiation (cytokeratin and/or epithelial membrane antigen expression) of the carcinomatous component, while sarcomatous areas showed epithelial differentiation in all but one case. The metastases showed uniform staining for cytokeratin (eight of eight cases) and epithelial membrane antigen (eight of eight cases), including the spindle cell component that was present in four of nine cases. Desmin significantly changed the interpretation of rhabdomyosarcoma differentiation by refuting putative rhabdomyoblasts in two cases and identifying rhabdomyoblasts in two other cases where they were unrecognized on hematoxylineosin staining. S100 protein was positive in all five cases with chondrosarcoma differentiation. Muscle-specific actin and vimentin were positive in the sarcomatous component of all cases and in the carcinomatous component of seven and 10 cases, respectively. After immunostaining, heterologous elements were present in 18 of 29 cases (11 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, three cases of chondrosarcoma, three cases of mixed rhabdomyosarcoma and chondrosarcoma, and one case of liposarcoma). Only six of 27 patients with follow-up were disease free for 12 months or longer (associated with stage I or II disease, smaller size, no lymphatic invasion in the resection specimen, and no invasion of the outer two thirds of myometrium). Presence and type of heterologous elements, grade of sarcomatous or carcinomatous components, histologic type of carcinomatous component, gross appearance, presence of necrosis, or use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy did not affect outcome. Carcinosarcomas are clinically aggressive distinctive mixed epithelial-stromal neoplasms with histologic and immunohistochemical features that overlap with metaplastic carcinoma in many cases.\r"

Our study included three aged male patients with a long occupational history of heavy asbestos exposure. In two patients, the metastases were discovered incidentally at autopsy, and there were no neurologic symptoms referred to before death. In the other patient, who had clinically occult mesothelioma, the intracranial tumor was discovered ante mortem: in this patient, the clinical features, as well as a computed tomographic scan, suggested a primary tumor of the brain. Interestingly, the histologic features of the latter case that were seen at autopsy depicted a spindle cell tumor that focally exhibited pseudopalisading, necrosis, vascular buds, which deceptively recalled a glioblastoma. All the three cases shared a basic sarcomatous pattern of malignant pleural mesothelioma in both primary and metastatic tumors. The immunohistochemical profile was consistent with such interpretation. It was concluded that metastases to the brain from malignant pleural mesothelioma, although rare, are not exceptional even if their clinical relevance is not prominent. They are seen concomitantly with high-grade tumors, and by mimicking a primary tumor on a clinical, instrumental, and histologic ground, they may occasionally represent a potential source of diagnostic pitfall.\r"

Patients with deep cerebral lesions (basal ganglia, parasellar, pineal, or third ventricle), those located in highly functional areas or those poorly defined on imaging studies, as well as candidates for brachytherapy, were selected. Smear examination during surgery was a routine procedure followed by conventional histologic methods. Ages ranged from 8 months to 81 years (mean, 33.64 years). The series comprised 258 tumors, 28 nonneoplastic cases, and 21 nondiagnostic samples. Of the 258 tumors, 179 were supratentorial, 28 were infratentorial, 36 were of the pineal area, and 15 were from sellar and suprasellar regions. Results of the histologic examination showed the following: astrocytic tumors, 148 (57.36%); oligodendroglial, 25 (9.68%); ependymal, six (2.32%); primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 17, including 14 pineoblastomas (5.45%) and three medulloblastomas (1.16%), seven lymphomas (2.71%), seven meningiomas (2.71%), four schwannomas (1.55%), eight craniopharyngiomas (3.10%), 12 germinomas (4.65%), and 20 metastases (7.78%). Nontumoral cases included six arteriovenous malformations, six pyogenic lesions, seven infarcts, two hematomas, one multiple sclerosis plaque, one Fahr, one progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, one tuberculosis, one cysticercosis, and one Chagas' encephalitis. Awareness of the cerebellar granular layer in infratentorial targets as well as glial reaction around craniopharyngiomas is essential to avoid misdiagnosis. Difficulties were basically differential diagnosis between well-differentiated astrocytomas vs glial reaction, as well as poorly differentiated neoplasms vs metastases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The neoplastic cells in these nodules were slightly larger than small lymphocytes and had more or less cleaved nuclei. Immunostaining on paraffin-embedded sections showed that the neoplastic cells in the nodules of these cases were LN-1- and LN-2+ and had monotypic immunoglobulin (IgM-lambda and IgM-kappa, respectively). Immunostaining on frozen tissue specimens showed that the neoplastic cells or nodules were positive for surface IgM, surface IgD, alkaline phosphatase, and DRC-1. One third to two thirds of the cells were Leu-1+ (CD5+). These results indicated that these cases were primary gastric mantle zone lymphoma. More attention should be paid to primary gastric mantle zone lymphoma because this disease might be erroneously diagnosed as either pseudolymphoma or reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of the stomach.\r"

  ".W": "Details of injuries and exposures to body fluids while handling tissue that were sustained by 36 pathologists (nine residents and 27 staff pathologists) were ascertained by retrospective questionnaire. In the preceding year 56% (20/36) had sustained a cut or needlestick injury. A total of 72 individual injuries occurred and corresponded to one injury for every 2629 surgical specimens handled and for every 37 autopsies performed. Residents reported a five-fold excess in injuries compared with staff pathologists. The lesions described predominantly (67%) involved the oppositional area consisting of the distal thumb, index, and middle fingers of the nondominant hand; during dissection, when opposed to hold or retract tissue, these digits form a surface that is directly exposed to the cutting edge, and injury to this area may be termed dissector's digital injury. Injuries to other areas of the nondominant hand were much less numerous and the dominant hand was rarely injured. Splashes to the face and eyes and glove punctures were frequent. These injury and exposure rates are probably broadly representative of practice in areas of low acquired immunodeficiency syndrome prevalence and may be improved on with increasing concern about human immunodeficiency virus infection. It is likely, however, that development of comfortable protective devices, based on knowledge of the pattern and circumstances of injury, will be necessary to eliminate these occupational hazards.\r"

Twenty-nine of the subjects (46.0%) gave a history of atopy that was confirmed in 12 by either IgE level or a positive radioallergosorbent test. Twenty-nine (46.0%) complained of formaldehyde sensitivity. In this study, no pathologist had allergen-specific IgE directed against formaldehyde, and there was no evidence of a tendency for atopic subjects to be more prone to sensitivity to formaldehyde. However, this may be related to a deliberate reduction in exposure by individuals experiencing adverse effects.\r"

An extensive evaluation for hypercoagulable states disclosed that he had a normal total protein S concentration, but by assay and on crossed immunoelectrophoresis studies, he had a decreased concentration of free protein S. A family study demonstrated protein S deficiency in his father and in a sister. On a subsequent determination, the propositus had a decreased concentration of total protein S. This case illustrates the association of protein S deficiency with mesenteric thrombosis and serves to caution that a single determination of total protein S is not an adequate evaluation when the index of suspicion for a hypercoagulable state is high.\r"

Cells of the first type were basically the same as those of ordinary basal cell carcinoma. Cells of the second type showed varying degrees of cytoplasmic content loss in a worm-eaten pattern and seemed to consist of degenerating cells. Cells of the third type possessed a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum filled with medium electron-dense fine substance, which was also seen in the extracellular space. In relationship with the histochemical findings, and based on the histogenesis of adamantinoid basal cell carcinoma, we propose that subpopulations of tumor cells undergo spontaneous degeneration and that the spaces of such disappearing cells are refilled with products containing glycosaminoglycans secreted by another subpopulation of the tumor cells.\r"

Immunohistochemical analysis established the B-cell phenotype of the neoplasm, and electron microscopy of the signet-ring cells revealed endoplasmic reticulum-bound inclusions consistent with immunoglobulin. Primary malignant lymphomas of the urinary bladder are rare, and, to our knowledge, we report the first example with signet-ring cells.

Deep valvular incompetence was seen in 41%, saphenofemoral junction incompetence in 46%, and incompetence of one or more perforators in 46% of the extremities. Thirty-three percent demonstrated no evidence of associated saphenofemoral junction, deep vein, or perforating vein incompetence, while 20% had concurrent saphenofemoral junction, deep vein, and perforating vein incompetence. These data support the heterogeneity of venous disease seen in patients with varicose veins and suggest that surgical therapy be directed to a patient's specific pattern of incompetence rather than routine saphenofemoral junction ligation or stripping of the greater saphenous trunk.\r"

Levels of interleukin 2 and interleukin 2 receptors increased in bile earlier than in plasma, and interleukin 2 levels did not overlap among stable patients and those experiencing rejection, whereas levels of interleukin 2 receptors did. Serial measurements of interleukin 2 levels, particularly in the product of the transplanted organ, provide a reliable assessment of the immunologic status of the allograft.\r"

A variety of surgical techniques were used to shorten surgery, limit incision length, and optimize size-matching between vein grafts and arteries whenever possible. Arterial inflow was from the common femoral artery in 58 cases, from the distal superficial femoral or popliteal artery in 88 cases, from a tibial artery in three cases, and from a preexisting bypass in seven cases. In situ (75 cases), ex situ reversed- or nonreversed-vein (62), composite vein (nine), and polytetrafluoroethylene (one) bypasses were constructed. Four patients (2.7%) died, and seven grafts (4.5%) failed within 30 days. Actuarial patency and limb salvage 6 to 52 months after surgery were 87.1% and 91.6%, respectively. There were no significant differences in patency between in situ and ex situ vein grafts (93.2% vs 89.7%) or between common femoral artery inflow site and distal superficial femoral/popliteal artery inflow site (89.3% vs 88%).\r"

Malignancy was present in 74 (23.8%) of 311 irregular soft-tissue densities, in 40 (19.6%) of 204 cases with clustered microcalcifications, and in 33 cases (54.5%) when both features were present. Same-day admission and discharge were achieved in 491 patients and local anesthesia supplemented with intravenous sedation was used in 73 (74%) of the 98 patients (in 1989) by the end of the study period. Nonpalpable cancers were categorized pathologically as stage 0 in 25 patients (20.8%), stage I in 67 patients (55.8%), stage IIA in 24 patients (20.0%), and stage IIB in four patients (3.3%). The malignancy rate rose sharply from the fourth to the fifth decade.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively performed nuclear biliary patency imaging (HIDA scanning) in 62 patients who had undergone endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy for management of pancreaticobiliary disease with their gallbladders in situ. Elective cholecystectomy was not recommended because of advanced age, comorbidity, or absence of gallstones. All patients had patent cystic ducts at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography balloon cholangiography. Eighteen (29.1%) of 62 patients had nonvisualizing HIDA scans, and in 44 (70.9%) of 62 visualization was normal or delayed. Six cholecystectomies were required for colic (n = 1), acute cholecystitis (n = 4), and acute cholecystocholedochal fistula with cholangitis (n = 1). Among the patients with cholelithiasis and nonvisualization (n = 13), five (38.5%) required surgery, whereas only one (4.8%) of 21 patients with cholelithiasis and visualization required surgery. Nonvisualizing HIDA scans are frequent (30%) after endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy and have no clinical relevance in patients without cholelithiasis but predict the need for cholecystectomy within 16 months in 38.5% of patients with cholelithiasis.\r"

Ninety percutaneous transluminal angioplasty sites judged technically satisfactory by arteriography were evaluated. Significant hemodynamic improvement was seen in 81 (90%) of the 90 limbs, although both hemodynamic and clinical improvement were achieved in only 77 (86%) limbs. Duplex scanning within 1 week of successful angioplasty identified moderate (20% to 49% diameter reduction) or severe (greater than 50% diameter reduction) residual stenosis in 49 (63%) of 77 balloon-dilated arterial segments. The presence of a greater than 50% diameter reduction residual stenosis predicted further restenosis and late clinical failure (11% success rate at 1 year). When the degree of residual stenosis at the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty site was less than 50% diameter reduction by duplex scanning, the procedure was durable (80% success rate at 2 years), even in patients with critical ischemia, poor runoff, or diabetes mellitus.\r"

However, its efficacy and potential hazards have not been adequately tested in obstruction due to colonic cancer. We analyzed the early results of 23 consecutive patients with obstructive left-sided colonic carcinoma treated by primary resection and anastomosis following intraoperative antegrade colonic lavage. Two patients (8.6%) died, one from complication of anastomotic leakage. The significant postoperative complications were chest infection in three (13%) and wound infection in seven (30.4%). The average hospital stay was 16.5 days. The results of this study suggest that intraoperative bowel irrigation permits one-stage resection and anastomosis to be conducted with reasonable safety provided care is taken in operative techniques.\r"

  ".W": "Data on 126 consecutive patients who were admitted to our clinics from January 1979 to May 1989 were scrutinized to assess changes in portal hemodynamics following splenectomy. Two groups were classified: (1) a group of 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and (2) a group of 20 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH). Portal thrombosis was present in five (25.0%) of the 20 patients with IPH and in two (1.8%) of the 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver. As seen on celiac arteriography, the mean (+/- SD) diameter of the trunk of the splenic artery and vein was 8.99 +/- 1.55 and 16.2 +/- 3.6 mm, respectively, in patients with IPH, while it was 7.94 +/- 1.28 and 14.2 +/- 3.1 mm, respectively, in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Changes in portal venous pressure were 78.4 +/- 59.4 mm H2O in patients with IPH and 43.5 +/- 38.7 mm H2O in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. There were no significant differences in the maximum level of thrombocytes in patients with IPH or in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver. These events suggest that portal thrombosis can occur with a significantly higher incidence in patients with IPH than in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver after splenectomy, and a decrease in blood flow in the portal vein may be closely linked to the formation of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with IPH. Preoperative examination of portal hemodynamics must be thorough.\r"
