Studies in patients with Cushing's disease or adrenal insufficiency have also supported the existence of fast feedback in humans. However, few studies exist in normal healthy subjects or depressed patients. This study compared fast-feedback inhibition of beta-endorphin/beta-lipotropin secretion by hydrocortisone in 16 control subjects and 16 depressed patients. A fast-feedback effect of hydrocortisone on beta-endorphin/beta-lipotropin secretion during the hour of the hydrocortisone infusion was demonstrated in control subjects. Depressed patients demonstrated no increase in beta-endorphin/beta-lipotropin concentrations during the infusion. These data suggest a decreased sensitivity to glucocorticoid fast feedback in depressed patients and complement existing studies demonstrating decreased sensitivity to proportional feedback by dexamethasone in depressed patients. We believe the data presented herein are the first demonstration that abnormal feedback occurs at the level of the brain rather than pituitary in depressed patients.\r"

Among these \"new\" patients, 557 (38.4%) had positive General Health Questionnaire scores. Only 47% of the new patients who met Bedford College diagnostic criteria for anxiety, depression, or ill-defined disorder had their psychiatric disorder recognized by their GP. Among patients who met Bedford College criteria, mean episode durations were longer for anxiety disorders (20 to 22 months) than for depressive disorders (9 to 10 months). Among the new patients, those with psychiatric disorders recognized by the GP were more likely to receive mental health interventions. Recognition was associated with shorter episode duration among patients with an anxiety disorder, but not among patients with depressive or ill-defined disorders.\r"

Repetition priming might be useful in differentiating between depression and dementia.\r"

There was a statistically significant comorbidity of the affective and anxiety disorders with anorexia nervosa. The first-degree relatives of the anorectic probands had significantly more alcoholism and total number of psychiatric diagnoses compared with the first-degree relatives of controls. There were two mothers with bulimia nervosa, two cases of anorexia nervosa and two of bulimia nervosa in other first-degree relatives of anorectic probands, and no cases of eating disorders in the first-degree relatives of controls.\r"

However, there is clinical and psychometric evidence that a personality evaluation undertaken while a patient is in a dysphoric mental state may distort or misrepresent traits, the so-called trait-state problem in personality assessment. The present study appears to be the first to investigate this phenomenon with a clinical interview rather than with personality tests. It examined the effect of anxiety, depression, and level of global impairment on the diagnosis of personality disorder and the assessment of the criteria for the individual Axis II disorders. Eighty-four patients, most of whom had current Axis I diagnoses, were evaluated by seven experienced clinicians with a new semistructured interview, the Personality Disorder Examination. The sample evidenced a trend toward acknowledging fewer maladaptive personality traits at follow-up than at entry. There was no evidence, however, that anxiety or depression had affected either the diagnosis of a personality disorder or the criteria associated with most of the individual personality disorders.\r"

Ten responding patients were discharged and unavailable for follow-up or refused subsequent randomization, and one non-responding patient refused randomization. The remaining 95 responding or nonresponding patients were then randomly assigned, double-blind, to a dosage of haloperidol two to 10 times higher (mean, 11.6 +/- 4.7 mg/d) or to a continuing NT dosage (mean, 3.4 +/- 2.3 mg/d) for another 2 weeks. Of the 58 patients exposed only to NT dosages of haloperidol, 72% clinically recovered within the 5-week trial. Higher dosages given to 47 patients did not lead to greater improvement in measures of psychosis, but did produce slightly greater declines in measures of hostility. Higher dosages did regularly lead to significant increases in distressing extrapyramidal side effects.\r"

The severity of the symptoms of organic delusional syndrome are compared with those of schizophrenia to determine which symptoms distinguish between these two diagnostic categories. Patients with organic delusional syndrome demonstrated significantly more symptoms of \"acquired intellectual impairment,\" \"impaired sensorium,\" and \"hallucinations of smell, taste, or touch,\" while schizophrenic patients demonstrated more \"flat affect,\" \"emotional coldness,\" and \"thought disorganization.\" In addition, associated factors are presented concerning demographics, modes of treatment, level of functioning, and current physical problems associated with organic delusional syndrome.\r"

Although the criterion-group system resulted in more stable standards, it still meant that the standard moved whenever the performance of the reference group changed. After conducting research, surveying constituencies, and examining alternatives, the NBME has adopted a new standard-setting plan that has the following components: a content-based standard-setting procedure; determination of standards by an appropriate group; use of a fixed standard; and periodic review of standards and standard-setting procedures. This new process will produce three types of improvements: it will incorporate deliberations informed by a wide range of information, including content review; annual review of examinees' performances and pass-fail results and triennial restudy of the process will add further quality control; and a fixed standard will mean that comparable performances will be required across administrations in order to pass.\r"

This paper presents data from the Association of American Medical Colleges' 1989 survey of 125 member faculty practice plans. The survey data showed that 62% of the 74 responding plans were units or associations within the medical school corporate structure. Plans were organized along a broad continuum from the autonomous, departmental model with decentralized governance and management to the group model with centralized governance and management. The growth of managed care, increased competition, and a greater reliance by the medical school on clinical practice income as a financing source are causing the practice plan to expand beyond billing of professional fees. The survey data showed that 75% of the practice plans operated satellite centers, and 61% planned to build new ambulatory care facilities in order to expand and improve services to patients. The practice plans also have adapted to changes in third-party reimbursement and are establishing mechanisms to negotiate managed care contracts involving multiple clinical departments to increase referrals and maintain patient shares; 86% of the plans participate in at least one managed-care organization. The role of the practice plan will continue to evolve in response to the needs of the academic medical center for a cooperative and supportive environment in which to conduct its traditional missions of teaching, research, and patient care.\r"

The recapitulation of that experience calls attention to the fragility of hospital planning, the dangers that underemployed physicians will overtreat patients, the advantages of using nurses as patient care managers in hospitals, and the desirability of not operating too close to the margin. These events of World War II also provide background for understanding the origins of three major post-World War II transformations of U.S. medicine, specifically the much-enhanced demand by the American public for access to a much higher level of medical care than that to which they had earlier been accustomed; the greatly enlarged expenditures of the federal government for basic biomedical research, which derived momentum from the success of research during World War II; and the victory of specialism that captured U.S. medical education and treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A reexamination of the possible relationships between medical students' undergraduate academic majors and their medical school performances and career plans seems appropriate, given the continuing changes in the characteristics of the medical school applicant pool in the last several years. This study investigated these relationships by comparing cognitive and noncognitive characteristics of medical students who had had different undergraduate majors. The study sample consisted of 812 students who entered Jefferson Medical College between 1985 and 1988. They were classified into six categories based on their undergraduate majors: biological, chemical and physical, social and behavioral, other sciences, humanities and arts, and indeterminate majors. Results indicated that performances in the basic science component of medical education were about the same for students with different undergraduate majors. The groups had similar rates of delayed graduation, but the attrition rate was highest for students who had majored in humanities and arts. The students in undergraduate disciplines traditionally oriented toward medicine (biological, physical, and chemical sciences) were younger and had made the decision to become a physician at earlier ages than had their counterparts with undergraduate majors in social sciences and humanities. Also, the groups differed with regard to their estimates of their future incomes and plans for professional activities after graduation. Similarities concerning the students' preferred professional activities were also noticed among the groups.\r"

A component of the review was the 1990 survey of 12 NBME constituencies to assess opinions about pass-fail rates and standard setting. The survey responses, generally consistent across groups, revealed (1) support for a more even distribution of fail rates across the three examinations, (2) support for a fixed standard, with pass-fail rates that change depending on the performance of a cohort of examinees, and (3) a favorable reaction to setting performance standards based on a review of the examination content. These responses may serve as a resource and a frame of reference for determining the standards for the comprehensive Part I and Part II examinations.\r"

The study's aim was to learn whether the new process is more predictive of residents' performances in their first year than was the process it replaced and whether the rough rankings computed directly from ratings of applicants are more predictive than the final rankings determined in a meeting by the department faculty, who modify the rough rankings. The 1982-1986 rankings and performances of 32 first-year residents at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine were studied and compared with the rankings and performances of 77 applicants from 1976 and 1978-1979 under the previous system. Correlation analyses revealed that for the applicants studied, the rough rankings in the new and the previous systems were equally predictive of performances as measured by rating scales, but that the new system was more predictive of performances on the surgery in-training examination. However, all correlations were small. Finally, the rough rankings obtained under the new system were more predictive of the residents' later performances than were the faculty's final rankings.\r"

The students' characteristics were essentially the same with respect to the preadmission variables, the proportions of women and minority students, course performances, scores on Parts I and II of the National Board of Medical Examiners examinations, and evaluation scores from residency program directors. This study offers additional evidence that the selection interview, as practiced in most U.S. medical schools, does not contribute to the predictive validity of the admission process.\r"

Although there is speculation in the literature about sexist attitudes and perceived sexual discrimination influencing a medical student's choice of specialty, there are few data on gender bias in the evaluation of residency candidates applying in different specialties. In 1989, the authors created six personal statements of interest in a residency, each from a different type of fictitious residency candidate (three men, three women, at three levels of medical school achievement) and mailed one or another of the statements, chosen at random, to the 2,478 board-certified Ohio physicians practicing in six specialties in which U.S. women in residencies were underrepresented (less than 12%) compared with the percentage of women in medical schools, and to the 3,586 board-certified Ohio physicians in another six specialties in which women in residencies were overrepresented (more than 38%). The physicians consistently rated the women candidates more favorably than they did the men candidates.\r"

Students interact with several standardized patients (SPs) and complete other tasks such as interpretation of electrocardiograms and interpretation of X-rays. Scores are generated both by checklists and rating forms completed by the SPs and by paperwork completed by the students at the end of each encounter. Since 1986, students have been asked how frequently they have been observed by faculty and residents as they interacted with actual patients; the students report that such observations have markedly increased. Since 1989, there has been increased feedback to students by the attending faculty during and following clinical rotations. Although it is difficult to claim cause and effect, it is clear that since the inception of this exercise, the faculty have made a conscious effort to improve students' clinical skills by providing increased observation and feedback.\r"

The survey obtained information on the graduates' status as parents, the \"breaks\" they had taken from their practices, and the hours per week they devoted to direct patient care, in order to observe what relationship the graduates' gender and status as parents had on the other variables. The women were far more likely to have taken breaks for parental leave, but the differences in the frequencies of breaks taken by the men and the women for other reasons were less striking. The women were working fewer hours in direct patient-care settings, and those women who were parents and under 35 years old spent fewer hours on patient care than did the men (from all age groups) who were parents. The authors discuss their findings in terms of the impacts of age and cohort effects and the possible lessening of gender-based differences in present-day physicians' practices.\r"

The investigation had two components: (1) a retrospective study of the classes of 1988 and 1989, which found that students' November grades from three first-year courses predicted 76% of the variance in the year-one weighted aggregate score and 41% for the year-two score, and (2) a prospective study of the class of 1992, in which three November of year one examination scores of the students in the lowest quarter of the class were highly predictive of their encountering substantial academic problems, with a sensitivity of .77 and a specificity of .99. This performance-based method was found to be more powerful than using the scores on the 1977 version of the Medical College Admission Test or the students' undergraduate grade-point averages, or both, in identifying individual students who were academically at risk.\r"

The residents generally agreed that geriatric problems were legitimate concerns in a general internal medicine practice but demonstrated less confidence in the management of geriatric problems than in the management of traditional problems. Residents from the program that provided more extensive training in geriatrics evidenced greater support for nondiscriminatory care of elderly diabetics; otherwise there was no convincing evidence of differences between the two programs. The authors conclude that educational efforts in geriatrics need to target trainees' confidence in the management of geriatric problems.\r"

On the average, 24.2 minutes were added when a resident was involved: 12.6 of these for the resident's examination of the patient and the remaining 11.6 for the resident's discussion of the case with the attending surgeon. These findings suggest that the education process builds in a time cost not only for the patient but for the attending surgeon, who has less time to see additional outpatients than does a private practitioner or a physician in a health maintenance organization.\r"

  ".W": "The uneven geographic distribution of physicians has been identified as a significant problem for the delivery of health care services. The present study examined one of the factors that contribute to the distribution of physicians; how far they move from their residency sites to establish their first practices. In 1989, the authors selected a random sample of 701 U.S. residency programs in the ten specialties with the most practitioners, and measured the distance each of these physicians moved to his or her first practice location. Of the 701 programs, 58.5% provided usable information about 2,612 physicians. Of these physicians, over 40% had moved less than 10 miles from their residencies, and over 50% had moved less than 75 miles. Comparisons among the physicians from the various specialties showed that the primary care physicians moved significantly shorter distances than did those from the other specialties. In the last two decades, many efforts have been made to increase the geographic distribution of physicians. The evidence from this study suggests that so far as the distances that physicians move from their practice sites are concerned, little has changed. Recent graduates of residency programs show no more tendency to move far from their residency sites than did their counterparts 30 years ago, as reported in the literature.\r"

For each candidate, the examiners completed a detailed checklist and two five-point global ratings dealing with the candidate's approach to the patients' problem and attitude toward the patient. Generalizability coefficients for both ratings were satisfactory and stable across cohorts. Construct validity of the global ratings was demonstrated by comparing entry and exit ratings and by evidence of significant and positive correlations between the global ratings and total test scores. Tentative evidence of criterion validity of the global ratings was demonstrated. These findings suggest that global ratings by expert examiners can be used as an effective form of assessment in multistation standardized patient examinations.\r"

The greatest differences in the rankings of both areas were found between those given by the freshman and sophomore students in the problem-based curriculum and those given by the same groups in the regular track.

Sixty-one percent (1,139) responded, of which 56% were FP physicians and 44% were in IM. On a visual analog scale to measure the physicians' interest in geriatrics education (from 1 = unimportant to 10 = very important), the FP physicians' mean score was 6.4; the IM physicians' mean score was 6.1. The preferred form of education was a two-to-three-day conference, and the preferred topics were acute care, long-term care, and rehabilitation. Stepwise multiple regression showed that the physicians' intent to take the Added Qualifications in Geriatric Medicine examination was the major predictor of their interest in geriatrics education (R2 = .12, p = .0001). Also significant contributors were the total amount of geriatric care the physicians provided, the home visits they provided, their prior participation in geriatrics CME conferences, absence of a negative attitude toward the Medicare system, and their lack of confidence in their current knowledge of geriatrics. The final model could account for 20% of these physicians' interest in future CME in geriatrics (R2 = .20). These findings may help geriatrics educators develop methods to educate primary care providers about geriatrics.\r"

The viral protein(s) essential to the induction of protective responses, however, have not been identified. To define the role of virion components in the induction of protective immunity, we evaluated the efficacy of glycoprotein-enriched and glycoprotein-depleted simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) subunit vaccines prepared by lentil-lectin affinity chromatography of gradient-purified virions using the immunization and challenge regimen previously found successful with an inactivated whole-virus vaccine. Infection was determined by successful recovery of virus, the induction of SIV-specific antibody responses, and infection of naive recipients by inoculation with lymph-node-derived lymphocytes from the vaccinates. Immunization with the glycoprotein-enriched preparation prevented infection in two out of four monkeys, whereas the glycoprotein-depleted vaccine failed to prevent infection in all four vaccinates tested. However, the glycoprotein-depleted vaccine appeared to moderate the progression of SIV-induced disease compared with non-immunized infected control monkeys inoculated with the same challenge dose. These data suggest that subunit vaccines containing sufficient quantities of viral glycoproteins can protect against SIV infection, whereas subunit vaccines composed predominantly of viral core proteins cannot. The development of effective vaccines against HIV infection should include studies on the optimum presentation of the viral envelope glycoproteins to produce long-term broadly protective immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "Reactivation of latent HIV-1 is believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Here we show that sodium butyrate (NaB), which can cause gene induction or cell differentiation, reactivates dormant HIV-1 in vitro in chronically infected cells of T-lymphoid and monocytoid origin. The effect of NaB on HIV-1 expression in T-lymphoid cells was apparent 3 h after addition of drug and peaked at 24 h. During this time the proportion of HIV-1 antigen expressing cells increased from less than 0.5 to greater than 90%, and virus production increased by three orders of magnitude. The virus released by the NaB-induced cells was infectious. The extent and kinetics of NaB effects were similar to effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in T cells, but not monocytes. Transient expression assays using an indicator gene under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat revealed that mutations which altered the nucleotide sequence in the TATA box significantly reduced the NaB effect. These data show that NaB is a potent inducer of dormant HIV-1 and suggest that the TATA motif is required for this activity.\r"

In order to begin characterizing this class of lymphoma, we initiated a molecular genetic study of DNA extracted from 31 diagnostic biopsy specimens from patients diagnosed with AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Analysis of 25 peripheral lymphomas showed that 14 were monoclonal B-cell processes, while 11 appeared to be of polyclonal origin. Five of the 14 monoclonal lymphomas were found to have rearrangements of the c-myc gene. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes were found in seven out of 14 monoclonal samples, but only two out of nine polyclonal samples. The six primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma samples were more homogeneous than the peripheral samples and all were monoclonal, positive for EBV and lacked detectable c-myc gene rearrangements. This study allows us to subdivide the HIV-associated lymphomas into three major molecular subtypes: (1) monoclonal B-cell process frequently associated with c-myc rearrangement or detectable EBV genomes, (2) polyclonal B-cell process typically without evidence of EBV, and (3) monoclonal primary CNS process associated with EBV genomes and lacking detectable c-myc rearrangement.\r"

N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (BuDNJ), deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), castanospermine (CAST) or the reverse transcriptase inhibitor 2'3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) had activities of 56, 560, 29 and 0.1 microM, respectively. MDL 28,574 was at least 50 times more active than BuDNJ and less active but better tolerated in cell culture than ddC, two compounds currently undergoing clinical trials. The CAST derivative showed good protection in H9 cells infected with HIV-1 (RF; IIIB; U455), and HIV-2 (ROD), although the potency was less than that seen in the JM/GB8 system. HIV-1 glycoproteins, gp160 and gp120, synthesized in H9 cells chronically infected with HIV-1 (RF) and treated with MDL 28,574, were characterized by an increase in relative molecular weight of approximately 7-8000 kD. The ratio of gp120 to gp160 was markedly reduced in treated cells and provided further evidence that cleavage of the gp160 precursor molecule is a major consequence of the inhibition of glycoprotein processing. The intracellular target for MDL 28,574 was verified as alpha-glucosidase-I of the processing enzymes by the analysis of high-glucose glycopeptides recovered from treated mouse cells. This activity correlated with the antiviral effect observed against the growth of a mouse retrovirus, Moloney murine leukemia virus (MOLV), in mouse cells.\r"

As a first step towards this goal we have identified potential T-cell epitopes, without B-cell activity against the native protein, from the first and second conserved sequences, and from three functionally important regions of the HIV-1 envelope protein gp160. For this approach, short peptide sequences selected by established computer programs were synthesized and chemically modified to generate either polymers with disulfide bonds, or micelles with two palmitic acid residues attached to the amino-terminal lysine. In both configurations several peptides were immunogenic without the need for coupling to carrier molecules. Of the 19 peptides we tested in our present studies, seven induced good T-cell proliferative response in mice representing four major histocompatibility complex haplotypes. None of these seven peptides produced antibodies that could recognize the envelope protein gp160.\r"

The mothers of all study children had been enrolled antenatally at a maternity hospital in Kinshasa, Zaire, which served a relatively affluent group of women who sometimes chose not to breast-feed their infants. In 106 children born to HIV-1-seropositive women, the rate of HIV-1 transmission was 21% in 28 infants exclusively breast-fed, 19% in 68 infants both breast- and bottle-fed and 0% in 10 infants who were bottle-fed only (P = 0.35). In contrast, non-HIV-1-infected children of both HIV-1-seropositive and HIV-1-seronegative mothers who were exclusively breast-fed compared with uninfected children who were not exclusively breast-fed had significantly lower incidence rates of acute diarrhea, fever and lower respiratory tract infection. The lack of a dose-response effect between breast-feeding and perinatal HIV-1 transmission and the presence of a protective effect of breast-feeding against common causes of early childhood morbidity and mortality support the current World Health Organization recommendation that breast-feeding should continue to be promoted in all developing countries, including those with high HIV-1 prevalence rates in women of childbearing age.\r"

  ".W": "In 1988, 1233 prostitutes from different geographic areas of Kinshasa participated in a cross-sectional survey on HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Despite relatively good knowledge about AIDS and STDs, the reported preventive behaviour was poor. Only 12% of the women reported regular use of condoms, while greater than 50% of the women reported regular use of antibiotics and 38% reported doing nothing specific to prevent STDs. Thirty-five per cent of the women were HIV-positive compared with 27% in a similar survey in Kinshasa in 1986. The prevalence of other STDs was very high, ranging from 5% for genital ulcer disease (GUD) to 23% for gonococcal infection. HIV-positive women were older than HIV-negative women (26.9 versus 25.4 years; P less than 0.001), had a significantly lower level of reported condom use (9 versus 14%, P = 0.009), and reported more frequent use of antibiotics to prevent STDs (55 versus 42%, P = less than 0.001). The prevalence of syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis was not higher in HIV-positive women compared with HIV-negative women. However, HIV-positive women had a higher prevalence of GUD (9 versus 3%, P less than 0.001), antibodies against Haemophilus ducreyi (82 versus 57%, P less than 0.001), antibodies against herpes simplex virus type 2 (96 versus 76%, P less than 0.001), condylomata accuminata (5 versus 1%, P = 0.003) and cytologic evidence of human papilloma virus on Papaniclaou cervical smear (11 versus 5%, P = 0.006). This study confirms the high incidence of HIV and other STDs among prostitutes in Africa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using data from a longitudinal study of 930 homosexually active men in England and Wales, this paper demonstrates that variation in numbers of PSPs (and thus HIV risk) is not related to variation in the gross numbers of sexual partners.\r"

Testing included baseline and post-stimulation evaluation of gonadal, thyroidal, and adrenal axes. Although adrenal function was within normal values in most cases, with no differences between patient groups, nine out of 98 patients had either a low baseline or post-stimulation serum cortisol, cytomegalovirus adrenalitis being suspected in two cases. Mineralocorticoid response was normal in all individuals. The main abnormalities were sick euthyroid syndrome with low tri-idothyronine and/or thyroxine in 16% of patients and hypotestosteronemia in 29% of men with AIDS. These abnormalities, related to a functional deficiency of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, were highly correlated with the degree of illness, i.e. weight loss and low CD4+ cell count. It was concluded that endocrine dysfunction in HIV-infected patients is rarely of clinical significance, that it is related more to cachexia and advanced disease than to HIV or opportunistic infections, and that it could serve as a prognostic marker.\r"

All the children were in good health. Each child was given three comprehension and three production tasks. In addition, each child's mean length of utterance (MLU) was obtained by observation of natural child-parent interactions. The development quotients (DQ) were assessed by Brunet-Lezine's tests. Infection significantly affected children's MLU, the infected children being less advanced than those non-infected. Both infected and non-infected children progressed in language acquisition from the second to the third year of age, but infected children had significantly greater production difficulty than non-infected children in the second year of life. The matched subjects design adopted gives some strength to the conclusion that HIV-1 infection impairs the genesis rather than the later development of language in infected but not ill children.\r"

FIV infection also prolonged shedding of FCV, with more of the FIV-infected cats becoming chronic carriers. Although vaccination induced protection against acute FCV disease, this was to a lesser degree in FIV-infected cats. Vaccination by itself also appeared to enhance long-term virus shedding. There was evidence of an impaired anamnestic FCV-neutralizing antibody response in FIV-infected cats following FCV challenge.\r"

A previously asymptomatic HIV-infected man, who was seronegative for human T-lymphotropic virus type I antibodies, developed a high-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma of anaplastic large-cell type which was Ki-1 + (CD30 +), HLA-DR+, epithelial membrane antigen +, CD25 +, CD71 +, CD2 + and CD5 +. Pan-B markers CD19 and CD22 and histiocytic marker CD68 were negative. At diagnosis the patient had 0.3 x 10(9)/l T-helper lymphocytes. The response to chemotherapy was dramatic and the patient is alive and disease-free 18 months after treatment. A review of previously described peripheral T-cell lymphomas in HIV-positive individuals is performed, and we conclude that the spectrum of neoplasms in such cases is probably broader than originally thought.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess by quantitative analysis the immediate angiographic results of directional coronary atherectomy. To compare the effects of successful atherectomy with those of successful balloon dilatation in a series of patients with matched lesions. DESIGN--Case series. SETTING--Tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS--62 patients in whom directional coronary atherectomy was attempted between 7 September 1989 and 31 December 1990. INTERVENTIONS--Directional coronary atherectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Increase in minimal luminal diameter of coronary artery segment. RESULTS--Angiographic success on the basis of intention to treat was obtained in 54 patients (87%). In four patients the lesion could not be crossed by the atherectomy device; all four had an uneventful conventional balloon angioplasty. Four of the 58 patients who underwent atherectomy were subsequently referred for coronary bypass surgery because of failure or complications; three of them sustained a transmural infarction. In the successful cases, coronary atherectomy resulted in an increase in the minimal luminal diameter from 1.1 mm to 2.5 mm with a concomitant decrease of the diameter stenosis from 62% to 22%. In the subset of 37 patients in which the changes induced were compared with conventional balloon angioplasty atherectomy increased the minimal luminal diameter more than balloon angioplasty (1.6 v 0.8 mm; p less than 0.0001). Conventional histology showed media or adventitia in 26% of the atherectomy specimens. In hospital complications occurred in six patients who had undergone a successful procedure: two transmural infarctions, two subendocardial infarctions, one transient ischaemia attack, and one death due to delayed rupture of the atherectomised vessel. All patients were clinically evaluated at one and six months. One patient had persisting angina (New York Heart Association class II), one patient sustained a myocardial infarction, one patient underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for early restenosis, and one patient underwent coronary bypass surgery because of a coronary aneurysm formation. At six months 80% (36/47) of the patients were symptom free. CONCLUSIONS--Coronary atherectomy achieved a better immediate angiographic result than balloon angioplasty; however, in view of the complication rate in this preliminary series, which may be related to a learning curve, a randomised study is needed to show whether this procedure is as safe as a conventional balloon angioplasty.\r"

SETTING--Department of cardiology in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--Eleven patients (10 with chronic stable angina and one with acute coronary occlusion after conventional angioplasty) in whom a coronary angiogram showed occlusion or critical stenosis of the coronary artery (right in seven patients, circumflex in two, and left anterior descending in two). The nature or severity of the lesion ruled out conventional coronary angioplasty. INTERVENTIONS--An attempt was made to cross the lesion with a rotating guide wire with a blunt swelling at its tip. Where necessary progress was assessed by simultaneous injection of contrast into both main coronary arteries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Progress of the ROTACS through the lesion that allowed a guide wire to pass into the distal vessel was regarded as a device specific success. When a guide wire crossed the lesion aided only by the support of the ROTACS without the use of rotation this was counted as a success that was not device specific. Failure to cross the lesion and any associated complications were noted. RESULTS--The ROTACS crossed only two of the 10 chronic lesions (20% device specific success rate); however, the support it provided enabled a guide wire to cross a further two lesions and allowed subsequent successful angioplasty in four of the 10 patients. One of these four patients presented after five months with recurrent angina requiring bypass grafting. The other three were symptom free at follow up seven months after the procedure. In the one patient with acute coronary occlusion the ROTACS was advanced over the guide wire to allow passage of an angioplasty balloon where this had previously proved impossible. An excellent final result was obtained and this patient remains symptom free. Three of the six patients in whom the ROTACS was unsuccessful had coronary artery dissection without sequelae. Three patients required subsequent elective coronary bypass grafting for control of symptoms while the other three remain well on medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS--The ROTACS may extend the range of patients with coronary artery occlusion or critical stenosis who can be treated non-surgically. The low device specific success rate (20%) achieved in this study indicates that it should be compared with other simpler mechanical devices that may be just as effective.\r"

DESIGN--Venous blood samples were collected before treatment with streptokinase started and subsequently at regular intervals over one year. Specific IgG and subclass IgG1 were assessed by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. SETTING--Coronary care unit in a general hospital. PATIENTS--48 patients with acute myocardial infarction: 22 patients had venous blood samples taken at presentation only; serial blood samples were taken from 20 patients who then received thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase and six patients who were unsuitable for thrombolytic therapy. RESULTS--Titres of antibodies to streptokinase were low at presentation in 36 (75%) of the 48 patients. Serial measurements made in 20 patients showed the virtual disappearance of antibody within the first 24 hours. This was followed by a steady increase in the specific IgG1 titre, which peaked at day 14 before gradually declining. Values at one year remained significantly higher than baseline values. There was no evidence of an IgM response in the patients studied. CONCLUSION--Low titres of antibodies to streptokinase were widespread in the population. Antibody was consumed after treatment and the subsequent immunoglobulin rise suggested a secondary immune responses; the recently described neutralising capacity to streptokinase is probably related to this antibody.\r"

Two-channel Holter recordings were obtained from the start of an intravenous infusion of streptokinase until coronary angiography (2.8 (2.7) hours (mean SD)) afterwards) in 57 patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than four hours who were generally not treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 21 (37%) of the 57 patients: accelerated idioventricular rhythm in 13 patients and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in 15 patients. Seven patients had both accelerated idioventricular rhythm and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Coronary angiography showed a patent infarct-related vessel in 12 (92%) of the 13 patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm (95% confidence interval 66 to 99%), in 22 (50%) of the 44 patients without accelerated idioventricular rhythm (95% CI 34 to 66%), in 11 (73%) of the 15 patients with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (95% CI 45 to 92%), and in 23 (55%) (95% CI 39 to 71%) of the 42 patients who did not have non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Seventeen (81%) of the 21 patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm, or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, or both, had a patent infarct-related vessel (95% CI 58 to 94%) as did 17 (47%) of the 36 patients with no ventricular arrhythmia (95% CI 29 to 65%). In patients with accelerated idioventricular rhythm after thrombolysis the infarct-related vessel is almost certain to be patent; but the infarct-related coronary artery can still be patent when no arrhythmia is seen.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND--The precise mechanism leading to the post-prandial worsening of angina has yet to be adequately defined. It has been attributed to an increase in double product but is perhaps more likely to be related to an increase in cardiac output after food. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of food on patients' exercise tolerance and compare these with changes in haemodynamic variables. METHODS--23 patients with chronic stable angina who had post-prandial worsening of their angina were studied. The patients were evaluated on two occasions and at each visit they underwent two symptom limited treadmill exercise tests. They remained fasting on the first visit and were given a 1400 kcal meal 60 minutes before the second exercise test on the second visit. Time to onset of 1 mm ST segment depression, heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, and cardiac output were measured at rest and during exercise. RESULTS--There were no differences in any of the variables during the two exercise tests on the day the patients remained fasting. After the meal exercise tolerance fell significantly by 136 seconds and the stage at which 1 mm ST segment depression was first seen was also significantly reduced. Resting cardiac output increased significantly by 0.86 1/min with the patients sitting and by 0.89 1/min standing. The exercise times after food were significantly related to cardiac output even when fasting times were taken into account. Resting heart rate increased significantly by 8.3 beats per minute sitting and 10.4 beats per minute standing. There was little change in blood pressure and no evidence that the double product predicted the post-prandial exercise time. CONCLUSIONS--Worsening of angina was related to the increase in cardiac output after a meal and successful treatment will depend upon the prevention of this increase.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective review of case notes with clinical and echocardiographic examination of survivors. SETTING--Cardiac surgery unit in a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS--62 consecutive patients undergoing mitral valve repair by one surgeon between 1979 and 1989. INTERVENTIONS--Mitral valve repair according to the criteria and techniques of Carpentier. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Frequency of repair, operative mortality, actuarial survival, freedom from reoperation and thromboembolism, clinical state, and echocardiographic state. RESULTS--The 62 patients, median age 58 years (interquartile range 51 to 64 years), represent 14% (70% confidence interval 12% to 15%) of the 454 mitral valve operations performed in the study period. Operative mortality was 8% (70% CI 5% to 13%). Actuarial survival was 62% (70% CI 43% to 81%) at nine years. At nine years actuarial freedom from reoperation was 91% (70% CI 79% to 102%) and freedom from thromboembolism 91% (70% CI 80% to 102%). At a median follow up of 33 months (interquartile range 21 to 74 months), 38 of 46 survivors had improved functional state. Of 21 patients who underwent echocardiography one had severe mitral regurgitation and one mitral stenosis. CONCLUSION--Although compared with other reports of mitral valve repair the prevalence of repair was low in this series the results are comparable and justify a positive approach to repair in all patients undergoing mitral valve surgery even if this can only be achieved in a small proportion of patients.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine left ventricular function after surgical resection of subaortic stenosis during childhood. DESIGN--Left ventricular performance was measured non-invasively in all patients who responded to an invitation for formal assessment. SETTING--Outpatient study, tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS--Twenty three (12 male and 11 female) patients (age range 3 to 31 years) of 43 consecutive patients with fixed subaortic stenosis undergoing surgical resection between 1975 and 1989 reattended for formal assessment 16 months to 15 years (median 4 years 4 months) after operation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Left ventricular dimension, left ventricular wall thickness, left ventricular Doppler inflow velocities, and left ventricular diastolic pressure (measured from apexcardiograms). Results were compared with those in controls individually matched for age and sex. RESULTS--All patients were symptom free. Left ventricular cavity dimensions were normal, as was the mean fractional shortening. Posterior wall thickness tended to be greater in the patients and there was a significant increase in septal thickness. Normalised peak rate of posterior wall thinning was significantly lower in the patients and the isovolumic relaxation time was significantly shorter. Doppler inflow velocity measurements showed that early diastolic mitral flow acceleration time was normal but deceleration time was significantly shorter in the patients. The ratio of mitral flow in early diastole (E) to E plus mitral flow in late diastole (A) was significantly higher in the patients and in two patients there was complete absence of A wave flow despite large A waves on the apexcardiogram. CONCLUSIONS--Systolic function was well preserved in patients after operation for subaortic stenosis. A restrictive pattern of left ventricular filling was common, however, and presumably reflected a response to the chronic pressure load and to surgery in the paediatric heart.\r"

In this study of 102 consecutive patients multivariate analysis was performed to identify which of 15 clinical and 11 electrocardiographic variables were independent predictors of ventricular tachycardia. These were shown to be a history of myocardial infarction, the QRS waveforms in leads aVF and V1, and a change in axis from sinus rhythm to tachycardia of more than 40 degrees. If none of the criteria was met, the diagnosis was almost certainly supraventricular tachycardia. If one criterion was met the diagnosis was probably supraventricular tachycardia. If two criteria were met then the diagnosis was probably ventricular tachycardia. If three or four criteria were met, the diagnosis was almost certainly ventricular tachycardia. The predictive accuracy was 93%. This was increased to 95% by including two other criteria--definite independent P wave activity and ventricular extrasystoles with the same QRS configuration as that in tachycardia. These criteria were not included in the multivariate analysis because though they were 100% specific they were seldom seen. These four criteria can be used as simple rules in determining the origin of a broad complex tachycardia.\r"

PATIENTS--Twenty infants who had undergone corrective cardiac surgery and who were in sinus rhythm, had stable haemodynamic function, and had a pulmonary artery catheter in place. All infants were receiving dopamine and phenoxybenzamine. INTERVENTIONS--Baseline haemodynamic measurements were taken and an infusion of the first drug was started at the lowest dose: after 20 minutes the measurements were repeated and the dose increased. This protocol was repeated for all doses of both drugs: 10, 30, and 100 ng/kg/min of prostaglandin E1 and 5, 10, and 25 ng/kg/min of epoprostenol. Cardiac output was measured by the pulsed Doppler ultrasound method. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances were calculated from the cardiac output and compared by the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. RESULTS--Both prostaglandin E1 and epoprostenol were effective vasodilators: 5 ng/kg/min of epoprostenol was equivalent to 30 ng/kg/min of prostaglandin E1.

These were coded for 8 aspects including the clinical summary, body measurements, descriptive content, organ weights, post mortem radiology and microbiology, histology and other relevant investigations e.g., biochemistry, cytogenetics. Overall 44% of the autopsies failed to attain an arbitrary minimum score of 300, the mean score being 299. Excluding those autopsies performed at the regional centre these figures were 50% and 268 respectively. These data indicate that a high autopsy rate does not necessarily reflect a high quality of service and further emphasise the concerns that have been expressed by obstetricians, paediatricians, geneticists, parents and parliamentarians about the perinatal pathology services in the United Kingdom.\r"

  ".W": "A consecutive series of 232 tubal microsurgical operations performed at the Jessop Hospital for Women, Sheffield, between 1983 and 1989, was analysed. The various contributory factors to tuboperitoneal damage were reviewed. Eighty patients (35%) conceived, resulting in 66 (29%) live births and 14 (6%) miscarriages. A further 12 (5%) had ectopic pregnancies. The overall cumulative conception rate (CCR) was 40% at the end of 50 months. Microsurgery has been most successful in the adhesiolysis group (n = 78) with a CCR of 46% at the end of 50 months. The terminal salpingostomy group (n = 97) had a CCR of 40% at the end of 36 months. There was a significant reduction in the live birth rate for the group with hydrosalpinx greater than 20 mm in diameter compared with the group with less than 20 mm (P = 0.05). The proximal anastomosis group (n = 27) had a CCR of 33%. No pregnancy was reported following reconstructive surgery for multiple occlusion sites. Overall, the extent of pelvic adhesions had a significant influence on the outcome (P = 0.02). The likelihood of conception was significantly influenced by the duration of infertility (P = 0.02) but not affected by the aetiology of tuboperitoneal damage, parity or age of the patient. In our hands, tubomicrosurgery is more cost-effective than in-vitro-fertilization as a primary treatment of infertility due to tubal diseases.\r"

INTERVENTIONS--Full investigation for other causes of infertility followed by abdominal microsurgical salpingostomy. Repeated meticulous follow-up was essential with check laparoscopy one year after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Successful pregnancy in relation to tubal damage. RESULTS--In 65 women microsurgery followed tubal reocclusion after failed conventionally performed salpingostomy. 74 women (23%) had one term pregnancy after primary salpingostomy and 12 women (18%) after repeat salpingostomy. Over half the women having a term pregnancy subsequently had a second infant. The tubal damage was classified in four stages according to the degree of mucosal damage and tubal fibrosis, the presence of isthmic disease and the quality of tubal and ovarian adhesions. Approximately one quarter of patients had stage I disease and amongst these 39% had babies after primary salpingostomy and 25% after repeat salpingostomy. CONCLUSION--Microsurgical salpingostomy is a specialized procedure. Proper selection of patients, competent microsurgical technique and adequate follow-up appear crucial to success. In selected patients treatment by salpingostomy gives better results than multiple cycles of in vitro fertilization.\r"

INTERVENTIONS--Placental bed biopsies obtained during caesarean section. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Histological appearance of sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin PAS and Lendrum's MSB. RESULTS--Biopsies containing spiral arteries were obtained from 6 normotensive and 44 hypertensive women. Trophoblastic invasion was present in 5 of the 6 normotensive biopsies but absent in the majority of those with hypertension. Subintimal proliferation was seen in all the normotensive biopsies but in only 8 of 28 from those with gestational hypertension and proteinuria. Other features seen predominantly or only in the hypertensive biopsies, in order of frequency, were medial hyperplasia, fibrin deposits, acute atherosis, endothelial vacuolation and thrombosis. CONCLUSION--Absence of physiological changes may not be peculiar to preeclampsia but may be associated or even a result of various forms of hypertension in pregnancy.

Women with idiopathic ovarian failure (n = 10) had significantly better response than women with Turner's syndrome (n = 4), whereas women with premature ovarian failure associated with previous chemotherapy (n = 4) had an intermediate response. These observations suggest that the endometria of women with Turner's syndrome responded suboptimally to steroid hormones. However, all endometrial biopsies studied revealed secretory changes. Overall, the results of histological dating of endometrial biopsy were found to be positively correlated with endometrial thickness on day 19 of the cycle (r = 0.72, P less than 0.01). The plasma concentration of oestradiol on days 15, 19 and 29 of the artificial cycle were found to be significantly higher than those on the corresponding days of the natural cycle.\r"

DESIGN--Randomized controlled trial using sealed, opaque envelopes for allocation. SETTING--Delivery ward in a busy teaching hospital. PATIENTS--1250 nulliparae with a singleton live fetus with cephalic presentation, without epidural anaesthesia, who had achieved full dilatation. INTERVENTION--Intention to conduct second and third stages of labour in either the Birth-EZ chair or the conventional delivery bed, as randomly allocated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Primary measure: vaginal operative delivery; principal secondary measures: duration of second stage, perineal trauma, blood loss, women's views, and neonatal status. RESULTS--Delivery in the birth chair did not result in a reduction in operative delivery, overall. However, there was a reduction in vaginal operative delivery for fetal heart rate abnormality. There was no beneficial effect on perineal trauma or puerperal perineal pain. Post-partum haemorrhage was more frequent in the birth chair group. CONCLUSIONS--Delivery in the birth chair does not offer any obvious advantage to women over delivery on a bed.\r"

Maternal plasma CRH in the preterm group (median 70, range 9-597 pmol/l) before therapy was higher (P less than 0.05) than that in 23 control pregnancies, without uterine contractions, matched for gestational age (median 51, range 4-127 pmol/l). CHR levels determined after 3 and 24 h of treatment showed a 10% decrease in the indomethacin group and 10-20% decrease in the nylidrin group, but these changes were not statistically significant. After cessation of uterine contractions during tocolysis, 12 women proceeded to give birth preterm (less than 37 weeks) and their pretreatment CRH levels (median 195, range 9-597 pmol/l) were higher (P less than 0.05) than those in women whose pregnancy proceeded to term (median 52, range 16-207 pmol/l). In another group of women, full-term labour was not accompanied by any changes in maternal CRH levels. Umbilical plasma CRH levels were 1.1-9.8% of the paired maternal levels and did not rise with advancing gestational age. Nor had the type of delivery (elective caesarean section before labour, or preterm or term vaginal delivery) any effect on fetal CRH levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three pregnancies with fetuses at risk for pulmonary hypoplasia were studied weekly until delivery. The amount of time spent in fetal breathing activity was recorded under controlled conditions during 1 h using real-time ultrasound. An amniotic fluid index was determined. The clinicians and the pathologist were unaware of the ultrasound findings. Eight of 23 fetuses did not breathe at the last ultrasound examination. Three babies died of pulmonary hypoplasia and two of these showed fetal breathing before birth. The three deaths were associated with rupture of the membranes at less than or equal to 20 weeks gestation and of greater than or equal to 44 days duration. One infant developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The amniotic fluid index in these four pregnancies was low and the newborn infants had limb contractures. Chorioamnionitis/funisitis was noted in 13 placentas. Eight fetuses were assessed for fetal breathing within 2 days of birth. The lack of fetal breathing had sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 0.75 for chorioamnionitis/funisitis. In this pilot study the absence of fetal breathing was of no value in predicting lethal pulmonary hypoplasia, but was related to chorioamnionitis/funisitis. We recommend further studies of fetal breathing in relation to fetal/neonatal infections.\r"

The Doppler umbilical systolic-diastolic (S-D) ratio decreased with gestation in the negative group, suggesting continuing placental growth and vascular expansion, whereas the S-D ratio increased in the positive group (P less than 0.001), indicative of vascular obliteration. We suggest that the positive angiotensin pressor response is primarily associated with the placental vascular pathology. Angiotensin infusion had no acute effect on maternal uteroplacental or fetal umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms.\r"

However, more women had a clinically useful reduction in blood loss (greater than 40%) in the ethamsylate group. The onset of effect of mefenamic acid was rapid but ethamsylate showed a comparatively greater effect as the trial progressed. Cessation of treatment was followed by an increase in blood loss, more pronounced in mefenamic acid group who reverted to pre-treatment levels. A greater number of side-effects were reported with mefenamic acid.\r"

The case records of 331 women delivered by casearean section in their first pregnancy were reviewed. By standard radiological criteria, the pelvis was considered to be inadequate in 248 (75%) of them and adequate in 83 (25%). Of the women with a radiologically inadequate pelvis, 172 underwent an elective caesarean section. Seventy-six were allowed vaginal delivery: 51 of these women delivered vaginally and 25 required an emergency caesarean section. Of the women with a radiologically adequate pelvis, 61 achieved a vaginal delivery and 22 were delivered by caesarean section. All of the three cases of uterine rupture occurred in women with a radiologically adequate pelvis. This study suggests that x-ray pelvimetry is not a good predictor of the outcome of a trial of vaginal delivery. We conclude that the practice of routine postnatal pelvimetry should be abandoned.\r"

Strategically located between the intravascular space and vessel wall proper, the endothelium has a broad capacity to modify the functional state of adjacent or trafficking cells. Furthermore, recent findings indicate that the endothelium is an interactive tissue capable of responding to numerous mechanical, chemical, and cellular stimuli. The focus of this review will be a discussion of endothelial cell biology in relation to vascular structure and function, with particular emphasis on endothelial modulation of vasomotor tone. It is evident that endothelial cells contribute to the local control of vascular tone by releasing potent vasodilatory mediators, such as endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and vasoconstrictor mediators such as endothelin-1. The endothelium also serves to modify blood-borne signals to which vascular tissues respond. The kidney shares, directly and indirectly, in these events, making this emerging new area a focus of major interest for nephrologists.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the roles of butyrate and acylglycine formation in hypoxic proximal tubule cell injury and protection by glycine and to test the contribution of iodoacetate-suppressible metabolism to protection, (1) it was determined whether protection by glycine is fully expressed when glucose, lactate, alanine, and butyrate are replaced by alpha-ketoglutarate as the sole substrate for the tubules, (2) butyrate metabolism and acylglycine formation were directly measured in control and hypoxic preparations, and (3) it was assessed whether injury produced by iodoacetate, a potent inhibitor of glycolytic metabolism, is subject to protection by glycine. Susceptibility to hypoxic injury in medium with alpha-ketoglutarate as the sole substrate was similar to that seen in medium containing glucose, lactate, alanine, and butyrate. Tubules in alpha-ketoglutarate medium showed high degrees of protection by glycine against injury produced by 30-min of hypoxia, by iodoacetate alone, and by iodoacetate combined with hypoxia. Protection did not require preservation of cell ATP or glutathione. In glucose-lactate-alanine-butyrate medium, butyrate, measured by gas chromatography, was rapidly metabolized by oxygenated tubules and fully accounted for basal rates of oxygen consumption. Butyrate utilization stopped during hypoxia. Neither aspect of butyrate metabolism was altered by glycine. Formation of acylglycines was assessed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. In preparations treated with glycine, butyrylglycine was detected under both oxygenated and hypoxic conditions; the quantities, however, were small and no other acylglycines were found. These observations indicate that protective effects of glycine are independent of short-chain acylglycine formation and glycolytic metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "The role of xanthine oxidase and oxygen free radicals in postischemic reperfusion injury in the rat kidney remains controversial. Proximal tubules, the focal segment affected by ischemic renal injury, were isolated in bulk, assayed for xanthine oxidase activity, and subjected to 60 min of anoxia or hypoxia and 60 min of reoxygenation to evaluate the participation of xanthine oxidase and oxygen radicals in proximal tubule reoxygenation injury. The total xanthine oxidase in isolated rat proximal tubules was 1.1 mU/mg of protein, approximately 30% to 40% of the activity found in rat intestine and liver. Lactate dehydrogenase release, an indicator of irreversible cell damage, increased substantially during anoxia (39.8 +/- 2.3 versus 9.8 +/- 1.8% in controls) with an additional 8 to 12% release during reoxygenation. Addition of 0.2 mM allopurinol, a potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and dimethylthiourea, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, failed to protect against the reoxygenation lactate dehydrogenase release. Analysis of xanthine oxidase substrate levels after anoxia and flux rates during reoxygenation indicates that hypoxanthine and xanthine concentrations are in a 15-fold excess over the enzyme Km and 0.3 mU/mg of protein of xanthine oxidase activity exists during reoxygenation. Hypoxic tubule suspensions had a minimal lactate dehydrogenase release during hypoxia and failed to demonstrate accelerated injury upon reoxygenation. In conclusion, although xanthine oxidase is present and active during reoxygenation in isolated rat proximal tubules, oxygen radicals did not mediate reoxygenation injury.\r"

  ".W": "A relative deficiency of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is generally observed in dialysis patients with aluminum-associated osteomalacia or aplastic bone disease. It has been suggested that high PTH levels may protect against the development of aluminum-associated bone disease. Through the use of a previously established model of aluminum-induced osteomalacia in the rat, the protective effect of PTH was evaluated. Aluminum was administered intraperitoneally at doses of 0, 5, 10, and 20 mg during a 2-day period, and rats were sacrificed 5 and 12 days after aluminum administration. PTH (bovine 1-34) was administered via a subcutaneously implanted Alzet pump at 2 U/h starting 4 days before aluminum administration and continuing until sacrifice. As the aluminum dose was increased to 20 mg, the osteoblast surface and the bone formation rate decreased. PTH supplementation increased the osteoblast surface at all doses of aluminum and increased the bone formation rate at 0 and 5 mg of aluminum. However, even with PTH supplementation, osteoblast surface decreased as the aluminum dose increased. In the absence of PTH supplementation, osteoblast surface was markedly reduced when the serum aluminum concentration was greater than 400 micrograms/liter or stainable trabecular aluminum surface exceeded 15%. When the stainable trabecular aluminum surface was greater than 12%, the bone formation rate was zero even during supplemental PTH administration. A significant correlation was observed between serum aluminum and stainable trabecular aluminum surface (r = 0.80 at 5 days and r = 0.86 at 12 days; P less than 0.001). However, after PTH administration, less stainable trabecular aluminum was present for the same serum aluminum concentration. Both with and without PTH, the slope of the correlation between serum aluminum and stainable trabecular aluminum surface was steeper at 5 days after aluminum administration than at 12 days. In conclusion, for an equivalent aluminum exposure, high PTH levels protected against the development of low turnover aluminum bone disease in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "There are two known forms of hereditary polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in humans. Although both forms initiate early in life, autosomal recessive PKD is rapidly progressive to kidney failure shortly after birth whereas autosomal dominant PKD is slowly progressive, taking many years to end stage. Research in this field has been limited by the availability of suitable animal models of PKD. Recently the C57BL/6J-cpk mouse has been used to study the pathogenesis of rapidly progressive hereditary PKD. The study presented here describes a slowly progressive PKD in the DBA/2-pcy mouse. The disease trait is transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern and was localized to chromosome 9 through linkage to the dilute coat color and transferrin genes. Whereas some cystic changes were seen in fetal and newborn affected mice, renal enlargement did not develop until after 8 weeks of age and azotemia did not develop until after 18 weeks of age. Renal cysts were identified in all segments of the nephron and collecting duct and progressively enlarged with age. Individual cysts were found to be lined by a single layer of epithelial cells in most areas, with focal polyps and mounds of cells principally in collecting duct cysts. Early stages of cyst formation were associated with some abnormalities of tubular and glomerular basement membranes and accelerated eruption of incisors. Late stages of the disease were characterized by azotemia and chronic renal interstitial inflammatory infiltrates in all affected animals and cerebral vascular aneurysms in a few. We conclude that the DBA/2-pcy mouse has a form of renal cystic disease that appears similar in many respects to that seen in the dominant form of human PKD.\r"

A total of 131 patients participated in the 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the multicenter study. For the first 6 weeks (fixed-dose period), patients were randomized to receive 100 U/kg of epoetin beta or placebo thrice weekly; in the second 6 weeks (dose-adjustment period), the dose of epoetin beta ranged from 50 to 150 U/kg thrice weekly. Of the 131 patients who entered the placebo-controlled period, 122 crossed over to a 24-week open-label period, where all patients received active drug and doses of epoetin beta could be individually titrated after the first 6 weeks. One hundred patients completed the 36-week study. In all phases of the study, epoetin beta was shown to produce a consistent, sustained increase in hemoglobin (baseline, 7.1 +/- 0.1 to 10.5 +/- 0.2 g/dL) and hematocrit (baseline, 21.5 to 32.7%), which virtually eliminated the need for packed red blood cell transfusions. Reticulocyte counts rose initially in response to epoetin beta and stabilized at levels higher than baseline throughout the remainder of the study period (baseline, 1.7 to 2.5%). The placebo group showed no change in these parameters during the double-blind period. Similar patterns of response were seen in the original placebo group after crossover to active drug (mean hemoglobin increase, 2.6 +/- 0.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The urinary sediment was examined by light microscopy in 65 consecutive inpatients with renal insufficiency (not due to pre- or postrenal factors) referred to a nephrology consult service for evaluation. In the 60 patients in whom a single diagnosis was reached, the sediments of 34 (57%) contained an easily recognized cell, which we have called the \"bubble cell\". These cells were bizarre, large cells with a single nucleus, which appeared to contain one or more fluid-filled vesicles. Bubble cells were most prevalent in the sediment of patients with acute tubular necrosis but were also seen a variety of other renal diseases. In most patients with acute tubular necrosis, the sediment also contained \"normal\"-appearing renal tubular cells, muddy brown casts, and oval fat bodies which were indistinguishable from those seen in the nephrotic syndrome. By electron microscopy, the bubble cells appeared to be vacuolated renal tubular epithelial cells, which had characteristics of viable cells. Most bubble cells excluded the vital dye Trypan blue, whereas the normal-appearing renal tubular cells were typically strongly positive. It was concluded that bubble cells, often accompanied by oval fat bodies, are commonly present in the sediment of patients with acute tubular necrosis as well as many other types of renal disease. Most cells which would be classified as \"normal\" renal tubular cells in these sediments are dead. In contrast, the findings suggest that the bubble cell represents an injured but viable renal tubular cell. The frequent finding of oval fat bodies in the same sediments suggests that the oval fat body is also produced by tubular cell injury.\r"

  ".U": "91356009\r", 
  ".W": "To define the cellular targets for c-kit ligand (KL) and to study their functional properties and composite antigenic profile, we isolated cells expressing c-kit receptor (KR) from bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood, and fetal liver (FL) using immunoadherence to a recently obtained antibody (SR-1) against the human KR. Cells isolated by this approach (designated SR-1Ad) have the morphology of blasts and represent 1% to 4% of the original BM or FL populations. SR-1Ad cells from either source are highly enriched in progenitors (12% to 73%) and respond to KL in distinct patterns. In SR-1Ad cells from BM, the greatest impact of KL stimulation is on burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E), whereas in SR1-Ad cells from FL, the most significant KL effect is on a mixed erythroid/nonerythroid progenitor (erythroid/macrophage, colony-forming unit-mix [CFU-Mix]). When antibody SR-1 is continually present in culture, it neutralizes the effects of added KL. Furthermore, in the absence of added KL, it greatly diminishes the erythropoietin- and interleukin-3-dependent BFU-E growth in BM; whereas in FL, a wider spectrum of inhibition is observed, with CFU-Mix most severely curtailed. SR-1Ad cells coexpress other progenitor-associated antigens in a combination reflecting the dominant presence of erythroid progenitors (high expression of CD34, DR, CD38, and Ep-1; low expression of CD33). Several cytoadhesion molecules, ie, alpha L/beta 2 and alpha 4/beta 1 integrins, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and homing cell adhesion molecule 1, are also coexpressed. Our data provide new information on the isolation and characterization of KR expressing cells from normal, adult, and fetal hematopoietic tissues. On these biologically relevant target cells, the impact of ligand-induced stimulation or antibody-mediated ablation of KR function has been gauged.\r"

In vitro induced differentiation of primarily cultured bone marrow cells from the patients, colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and L-CFU colony-forming assays, and karyotype analysis were performed over the treatment course. The very high bone marrow complete remission (CR) rate (94%) suggested that all-trans RA was superior to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of APL. The leukemic clone was reduced by RA-induced terminal differentiation and loss of proliferation capacity of leukemic cells. Relapse after CR in about 40% of patients was the major reason for the failure of the RA treatment. Patients who relapsed after a chemotherapy-maintained CR could be effectively reinduced to second CR by RA. However, if relapse occurred after a CR maintained by both RA and chemotherapy, the sensitivity of newly emerged leukemic clones to RA was greatly reduced. Therefore, it is suggested that RA should be replaced by conventional chemotherapy as soon as CR is achieved. Laboratory studies proved valuable in selecting cases for RA therapy and in predicting therapeutic effects and prognosis.\r"

Transient neutropenia, monocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia were observed followed by a 1.3- to 6.0-fold (mean, 3.46-fold) dose-dependent neutrophil leukocytosis (P less than .00001) on the days of IL-1 beta administration. Increases in platelet counts were observed at a median of 14 days (range, 6 to 23) after IL-1 beta administration. Transient hypoglycemia, rebound hyperglycemia, elevations in serum cortisol, and C-reactive protein were observed. Side effects included fever, rigors, and headache in the majority of patients. Hypotension was observed in three of five patients at the highest dose level (0.1 micrograms/kg) and was dose-limiting. Fewer days of neutropenia were noted after 5-FU plus IL-1 beta than after 5-FU alone; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. These data show that IL-1 beta has stimulatory effects in human hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "The dominant white spotting, W, locus in the mouse encodes Kit, a receptor molecule with cytosolic tyrosine kinase activity. Mutations in Kit deplete hematopoietic cells by an as yet unknown mechanism, but one that presumably affects the early progenitors of all cell lineages. To examine cell lineage-specific changes caused by different W mutations, we injected genetically marked normal marrow cells into mutant mice and monitored repopulation kinetics. In the present report, we compare repopulation of the various peripheral blood cells in nonanemic W44J/W44J and severely anemic W/Wv mice administered increasing increments of donor cells. At all doses of cells tested, donor erythrocyte repopulation precedes leukocyte repopulation regardless of the recipient phenotype. There is, in fact, little difference in the rate or extent of nonerythroid repopulation in W44J/W44J mice injected with between 6 x 10(6) and 2 x 10(7) donor cells. The fact that donor cells rapidly replace erythrocytes, even in the nonanemic W44J/W44J host, while other cell lineages become donor type more slowly provides further evidence that mutations at the W locus are especially damaging to erythrocyte progenitors. We suggest that host nonerythroid hematopoietic cells compete with normal cells, probably at the level of early progenitors rather than at the level of the totipotent hematopoietic stem cell. The fact that successively higher doses of donor cells do not markedly alter nonerythroid repopulation kinetics implies that it may be possible to maximize autologous therapeutic marrow transplantation.\r"

Megakaryocytes could be observed for periods of up to 13 weeks in both the supernatant and stromal layer of these cultures. Using acetylcholinesterase staining for enumeration and sizing of megakaryocytes, and a novel rat antimurine platelet monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that detects only megakaryocytes in bone marrow, the number, volume, and ploidy of these cells were assessed microscopically and by flow cytometry. Correlation of these measurements with ambient interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels showed no relationship between IL-6 bioactivity and megakaryocyte number. Conversely, the relatively high IL-6 bioactivity present during the first 2 weeks of culture was correlated with increased megakaryocytic size and ploidy, while the relatively lower IL-6 bioactivity present after week 3 corresponded to decreased megakaryocytic size and ploidy. Addition of neutralizing anti-IL-6 MoAb decreased megakaryocytic size and ploidy at times when ambient IL-6 levels were relatively high, while the addition of exogenous IL-6 increased size and ploidy at times when endogenous IL-6 concentrations were low. The data show that long-term bone marrow cultures can be used as a means to evaluate megakaryocytic maturation in vitro, and suggest that, to some extent, IL-6 plays a role in the maturation process in this system.\r"

We have now examined the synergistic interactions between IL-11 and IL-4 in support of colony formation from marrow cells of mice treated 2 days before with 150 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil. Neither recombinant human IL-11 nor murine IL-4 alone was effective in the support of colony formation. When the two factors were combined, there was major enhancement of colony formation, including that of multilineage colony-forming cells. Serial observations (mapping studies) of development of multipotential blast cell colonies indicated that the synergy between IL-11 and IL-4 is due in part to shortening of the dormant period of the stem cells, an effect very similar to that of IL-6 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The combination of IL-11 and IL-4 may be useful in the stimulation of dormant hematopoietic stem cells in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "To establish the basis for the reduced expression of the X determinant on leukemic blasts and the changes in antigenic expression that occur during myeloid maturation, the presence on myeloid cells of X and related structures was examined in conjunction with studies on the activities of the glycosyltransferases involved in their biosynthesis. Expression of X and sialyl-X was weak on blasts in comparison with neutrophils despite the presence of the requisite precursor structures. Much higher levels of 3-fucosyltransferase activity were found in blasts than in neutrophils when nonsialylated substrates were used, but, whereas the enzyme in neutrophils reacted equally well with 3'-sialylated and nonsialylated acceptors, the enzyme in blasts showed a marked preference for nonsialylated substrates. 6'-Sialyltransferase activity was strong in blasts but was not detectable in neutrophils, whereas a much lower level of 3'-sialyltransferase activity was present in both blasts and neutrophils. Dimethyl sulfoxide-induced maturation of HL60 cells was associated with (1) a decrease in both 6'-sialyltransferase and 3-fucosyltransferase activities, (2) a change in the substrate specificity of 3-fucosyltransferase towards that found in mature cells, and (3) increased cell surface expression of sialyl-X. These results suggest that the reduced expression of X in myeloblasts is related to the presence of the strong 6'-sialyltransferase, which uses the precursor substrate at the expense of the 3-fucosyltransferase and prevents the synthesis of X and sialyl-X. The developmental regulation of the levels of 3'- and 6'-sialyltransferases, and the level and specificity of the 3-fucosyltransferases, therefore controls the expression of X and its degree of sialylation.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human interleukin-6 (IL-6) has previously been shown to increase platelet counts in mice and primates. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, serial analyses were performed on megakaryocytes obtained from rhesus monkeys treated for 8 days with 30 micrograms/kg/d of recombinant human IL-6. Platelet counts increased to a maximum of 7.8 x 10(5)/microL with biphasic peaks on days 7 and 12 without significant changes in platelet volumes. Large increases in DNA content were seen by two-color flow cytometry and digital image analysis. Ploidy distribution underwent a significant shift between study days 3 and 11 (P less than .0001) with large increases in the frequency of 64N and 128N megakaryocytes. The modal ploidy increased from the normal 16N to 64N. Megakaryocyte size, as measured by area, was increased 2- to 2.7-fold. On day 3, multiple megakaryocytes were seen in endomitosis, along with an abundance of young cells with wide, organelle-free peripheral zones. The giant megakaryocytes seen on days 5 to 7 exhibited marked membrane hyperplasia that occupied much of the cell. Emperipolesis occurred frequently, as did megakaryocyte cell death. No giant platelets were seen. We conclude that IL-6 significantly alters the process of megakaryocyte maturation and thrombocytopoiesis, and that these effects, at least in the doses of IL-6 administered, should not be equated with the physiologic mechanisms operative during accelerated platelet production.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we investigated the role of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in the malignant evolution of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and the functional activity of IL-1 inhibitors. Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) low-density cells from 38 CML patients were studied in the colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte, megakaryocyte colony culture assay. Samples from patients with early stage, interferon-alpha (IFN)-sensitive disease formed hematopoietic colonies in the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS), erythropoietin (Epo), and one of the following: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (10 ng/mL), IL-3 (15 ng/mL), both, or phytohemagglutinin-conditioned medium. The addition of IL-1 beta augmented IFN-sensitive CML colony growth in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 10 to 100 U/mL. In sharp contrast, addition of the above growth factors did not augment the colony growth-promoting effect of FCS and Epo in samples from IFN-resistant patients; further, adherent cell fractionation or T-lymphocyte depletion attenuated the \"autonomous\" colony growth. Lysates of 2.5 x 10(7) low-density cells from each of six IFN-resistant and six IFN-sensitive CML patients and three normal volunteers were tested for intrinsic IL-1 beta content in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and yielded a mean of 610 pg, 54.6 pg, and 49.4 pg of IL-1 beta, respectively (P less than .045). Interestingly, both soluble IL-1 receptors (sIL-1R) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) at concentrations of 5 to 100 ng/mL (sIL-1R) and 10 to 500 ng/mL (IL-1RA) inhibited CML colony growth in a dose-dependent fashion, with maximal inhibition of 64% and 65%, respectively. A similar effect was noted with the use of anti-IL-1 beta neutralizing antibodies. These data implicate IL-1 beta in CML disease progression and suggest that the inhibitory effects of molecules such as sIL-1R and IL-1RA could conceivably be the basis of a novel therapeutic strategy against this disorder.\r"

  ".U": "91356020\r", 
  ".W": "The spleen plays a central role in the pathogenesis of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP); it produces massive quantities of antiplatelet antibodies, leading to accelerated phagocytosis of platelets. Lymphoid hyperplasia typically occurs in the spleen, characterized by large numbers of lymphatic nodules with active germinal centers. Whether changes in splenic microcirculatory pathways also occur is not known. We have studied this question by scanning electron microscopy of corrosion casts, comparing spleens removed from patients with ITP with normal spleens obtained from organ transplant donors. The casts demonstrate two major changes in microcirculatory pathways in ITP. Firstly, a striking proliferation of arterioles and capillaries is found in the white pulp and marginal zone (MZ), seen as extensive vascularization in 92.3% of lymphatic nodules (n = 191) versus 0.6% (n = 224) in normal spleens. Secondly, the marginal sinus, a series of flattened, anastomosing vascular spaces between the white pulp and MZ, is absent in 89.4% of lymphatic nodules versus 4.9% in normal spleens. The cause of these microcirculatory changes, which may not be exclusive to ITP, is presently unknown. Absence of the marginal sinus may affect distribution of blood flow through the MZ such that platelets spend increased amounts of time in the proximity of macrophages. In the presence of antiplatelet antibodies found in ITP spleens, this delayed transit would lead to greatly increased platelet destruction.\r"

  ".W": "V pre-B and lambda-like genes are selectively expressed in human pre-B cells and encode polypeptide chains that associate in a mu-pseudolight chain complex that may regulate some crucial steps of early B-cell differentiation. We have followed by polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis the expression of these \"pre-B-specific\" genes in correlation with the status (rearranged v germline) of Ig gene loci (H, kappa, lambda) in a panel of 32 leukemias pertaining mostly to the B lineage and including a number of ambiguously characterized samples. All cells that had rearranged the H locus only expressed V pre-B and lambda-like transcripts, in agreement with a pre-B status. In this group, some biphenotypic leukemias (mostly My/B) might, in fact, be already engaged in the B lineage. Rearrangement of V kappa or V lambda loci correlated with the disappearance of the pre-B gene products. In a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line that was induced to mature to the B-cell stage in culture upon kappa gene rearrangement, the mu-pseudolight chain complex was actually replaced by the classical mu-kappa molecule. Finally, V pre-B and lambda-like genes were found expressed in two leukemic cells that had retained all Ig loci in germline configuration. This finding raises the possibility of having an early pro-B progenitor in which V pre-B and lambda-like products associate with a H chain surrogate in a complex that would trigger an early event of B-cell differentiation such as the H locus rearrangements.\r"

  ".W": "Raji, a malignant B-lymphocyte cell line containing Epstein-Barr virus genomic elements, has been conditioned to proliferate optimally in transferrin (Tf)-free medium containing a very low concentration of an iron salt. We provide evidence that an Tf-independent iron uptake system is physiologically important for maintaining the growth of these cells. The data show that Raji cells take up iron from iron salts using a relatively high-capacity, low-affinity, temperature- and calcium-dependent uptake system. The apparent capacity of this system increases when: (1) cells are cultured in Tf-free medium containing high concentrations of iron salt as opposed to medium containing Tf; and (2) when the iron salt concentration of Tf-free medium is lowered to about 1.6 mumol/L. Cellular iron uptake also increases when a maximum number of cells are in S and G2 and M cell phases of the cell cycle. The cells are sensitive to growth inhibition by the addition of deferoxamine. This evidence supports the hypothesis that certain malignant lymphocytes, under iron deplete conditions, fulfill an iron requirement for proliferation by an adaptation such as Tf-independent iron uptake.\r"

Two additional groups of four rabbits each were similarly inoculated with control uninfected 729 or HuT 78 cells. Early and persistent seroconversion to HTLV-II core antigen p24, as determined by Western immunoblot, occurred in all HTLV-II-inoculated rabbits and was most intense in rabbits inoculated with G12.1 cells; seroreactivity to other HTLV-II gag or env antigens occurred later, with less intensity, or not in all inoculated rabbits. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and other lymphoid cells from HTLV-II-inoculated rabbits produced minimal p24 in vitro, as determined by enzyme immunosorbent capture assay. Virus was more readily detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of HTLV-II pol sequences; this occurred most frequently in rabbits inoculated with Mo-T cells, and most frequently in PBMC as compared with other tissues tested (bone marrow, brain, and liver). No evidence of disease occurred in HTLV-II-inoculated rabbits observed for as long as 24 weeks. All control rabbits remained negative for evidence of HTLV-II infection, as determined by the same procedures. These results provide the first evidence of HTLV-II infection in a species other than humans, and demonstrate the usefulness of the rabbit as an animal model to study the biologic response to different isolates of this human retrovirus.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral eosinophilia is almost invariably observed during the course of interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy and is frequently accompanied by the development of a capillary leak syndrome characterized by edema, weight gain, and oliguria. We studied five patients with advanced malignancy treated with IL-2. Eosinophilia was not present initially but developed in all patients late in the course of therapy, with counts ranging from 2,328/mm3 to 15,958/mm3. In all patients, there was a temporal relationship between the infusion of IL-2 and the appearance of elevated plasma concentrations of IL-5, a growth factor for eosinophils. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was not detectable in plasma. IL-4 and gamma-interferon plasma levels were variably elevated. Plasma concentrations of major basic protein, a toxic eosinophil granule protein, began increasing before eosinophil counts increased. By the time of the third IL-2 infusion, high concentrations of major basic protein were present in all five patients (up to 5,600 ng/mL) and skin biopsies showed major basic protein deposition in the dermis. Four patients developed significant capillary leak syndrome and all of these patients showed markedly elevated major basic protein levels. The lowest peak plasma concentration of major basic protein (1,751 ng/mL) was observed in the one patient who did not develop edema and weight gain. These results suggest that IL-2 induces IL-5 leading to marked peripheral eosinophilia and extravascular eosinophil degranulation. The release of toxic eosinophil products at extravascular sites and in the circulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of the capillary leak syndrome complicating IL-2 therapy.\r"

As compared with an older age population (greater than or equal to 50 years), there were no major differences in presenting features except for an increased proportion of males (2.08 v 1.21; P less than .025) and a higher hemoglobin level (13.47 +/- 2.70 g/dL v 12.84 +/- 2.77 g/dL; P less than .05) in the younger group. Median survival is 12.3 years (expected median from a control group, 31.2 years). Clinical stages, bone marrow patterns, blood lymphocyte counts, and its doubling time are all useful to separate different risk groups of patients. Whereas patients with favorable prognostic factors have a survival probability of about 80% 14 years after diagnosis, those with poor prognostic features have a median survival of less than 3 years. It is concluded that CLL in younger adults has no major distinctive presenting features and that known prognostic factors are useful to separate different risk groups of patients. These results should be of help in planning therapy for younger persons with CLL.\r"

  ".U": "91356029\r", 
  ".W": "The t(14;18) chromosomal translocation that results in the juxtaposition of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene with the heavy chain JH locus is a common cytogenetic abnormality in human lymphoma. In particular, it is seen in about 85% of follicular lymphoma (FL) and up to one-third of diffuse lymphomas (DL). The chromosome 18 breakpoints have been shown to cluster into two regions. The major breakpoint region (mbr) within the 3' untranslated region of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene accounts for approximately 60% of the cases and the minor cluster region (mcr) 30 kb 3' of bcl-2 accounts for approximately 25% of the breakpoints. Because of variability in the position of the breakpoint, detection of the t(14;18) by Southern blot analysis provides an important clonal marker for the tumor. However, conventional electrophoresis (CE) fails to detect the translocation in 15% to 25% of cases. We have applied pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to the detection of the t(14;18) in a series of lymphoma prospectively analyzed by CE, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and cytogenetic analysis. PFGE readily detected t(14;18) rearrangements as indicated by comigration of bands detected with probes for the mbr region (chromosome 18) and the JH locus (chromosome 14). In a series of 40 patients with FL, this method proved to be the most comprehensive for detection of the translocation compared with standard methods; in fact, in one case only PFGE was able to detect the chromosomal rearrangement. Ten percent of the FL cases were negative by all methods tested. In a separate analysis of matched tissue specimens from cases of tumor progression of FL to diffuse lymphoma, PFGE detected a common t(14;18) rearrangement confirming a clonal origin in seven of seven cases, whereas CE detected a rearrangement in only three of seven cases. Overall, PFGE was able to detect a translocation in 8 of 12 cases that were negative by CE and four of eight negative by cytogenetic analysis. In conclusion, PFGE analysis is more comprehensive than CE, PCR, and cytogenetic analysis for the detection of the t(14;18) breakpoint in tissue biopsies of malignant lymphoma.\r"

The proportion of CD4 and CD45RA was decreased when compared with T cells from normal subjects. CD8 was markedly increased. The activity of concanavalin A-induced suppressor cells was not significantly different from that of normal controls and was negatively correlated to the percentage of CD4 of B-CLL patients. The selective loss of CD45RA cells was more prominent in patients in advanced Rai stages of the disease (III to IV) than in early stages (0 to II). Six patients of the advanced stages group suffered from autoimmune hemolytic anemia, whereas no patient in the early stages of disease showed an autoimmune phenomenon. Our results may indicate a mechanism of autoimmunity in B-CLL similar to that of patients with autoimmune diseases.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of recombinant human interleukin-4 (rhIL-4) on the in vitro growth of human leukemia cells in liquid culture and 3H-thymidine incorporation and found inhibitory effects on the growth of leukemic cells from patients with Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph1 ALL) and three Ph1 ALL cell lines. However, no inhibitory effects were seen in Ph1-positive leukemic cell lines derived from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis and various types of Ph1-negative leukemia cells, including B-lineage leukemia cells. In a flow cytometry assay of IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), all three Ph1-positive ALL cell lines showed the presence of IL-4R on their cell surfaces, and the IL-4-dependent inhibition on the growth of Ph1-positive ALL cells was abrogated by the addition of either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against rhIL-4. Other cytokines, including IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-CSF, and IL-6, showed no inhibitory effects on the growth of Ph1-ALL cells, but tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon (IFN)-alpha, -beta, and -gamma displayed slight inhibitory effects in a high concentration. The growth inhibition induced by rhIL-4 in the Ph1-positive ALL cells was not abrogated by the addition of antibodies against either IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha. Furthermore, these cells showed no significant production of IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma or TNF-alpha after exposure to rhIL-4, thus indicating that the growth inhibition of Ph1-positive ALL cells by rhIL-4 is not associated with IL-4-stimulating production of these factors. rhIL-4 caused significant inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity in these Ph1-positive ALL cells, similar to Herbimycin A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase that inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity in these cells. Our finding suggests that the clinical evaluation of rhIL-4 may offer promising therapeutic possibilities for patients with Ph1-positive ALL.\r"

Northern blot analysis of RNAs from 63 leukemia samples showed that VpreB RNA was present in malignancies of precursor B cells, the expression being a feature of both common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (CD10+) and null ALL (CD10-). It was absent from malignancies of mature B cells (surface Ig positive), from acute leukemias of the T-cell lineage and granulocyte-macrophage lineages, and from normal tonsil B and T lymphocytes. Chronic myeloid leukemia blast crises of the B-precursor-cell type expressed the VpreB gene while myeloid blast crises did not. VpreB RNA was also expressed in the neoplastic cells of one of three patients with acute undifferentiated leukemias. These data show that VpreB RNA expression is a marker of the malignant forms of precursor B cells, and that it appears at least as early as cytoplasmic CD22 and CD19 in tumors of the B-cell lineage.\r"

The beta minor/alpha globin chain synthesis ratio increased slightly but significantly between day -4 (0.75 +/- 0.07) and day 4 (0.81 +/- 0.04) (P = .01) and reached a minimum ratio (0.67 +/- 0.03) on day 15 (P = .001), being parallel to reticulocyte counts and to the incorporated trichloracetic acid (TCA)-insoluble radioactivity, therefore parallel to the erythropoietic output in thalassemic mice, as in normal mice. Erythrocyte defects were improved in beta thalassemic mice treated by rhEpo: membrane-associated alpha globin was significantly decreased (P less than .01), thiol group reactivity of ankyrin was significantly improved (P less than .05), spectrin alterations were reduced, and deformability of mouse thalassemic red blood cells was normalized. These results provide experimental criteria for modulating globin chain imbalance necessary for the therapy of human beta thalassemia intermedia, and suggest that rhEpo might be of interest to improve the red blood cell mass and reduce erythrocyte alterations in this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Glycophorin C (GPC) and glycophorin D (GPD) are highly glycosylated integral membrane proteins of human erythrocytes encoded by the same gene and associated with expression of Gerbich blood group system antigens. GPC/D deficiency (the Leach phenotype) is a rare condition usually found after identification of Gerbich blood group system antibodies in persons undergoing prenatal or pretransfusion evaluation. In all cases, the Leach phenotype has been associated with elliptocytosis. Characterization of the molecular basis of this phenotype in three previously uninvestigated families has shown that the most common genetic basis of GPC/D deficiency is deletion of exons 3 and 4 of the GPC gene. However, in one family, the Leach phenotype appeared due to a deletion of one nucleotide in exon 3, causing a frameshift mutation in the messenger RNA and premature generation of a stop codon. The GPC and GPD protein sequences are therefore interrupted in the extracellular domain and probably intracellularly degraded.\r"

  ".W": "Bone marrow harvested from cancer patients for autologous bone marrow reinfusion (ABMR) after myeloablative treatment may be injured, in both its proliferating and stromal cell pools, by either previous treatment or manipulation at the time of harvest. We have examined the relative effects of seven covariates on hematologic recovery after ABMR in children with neuroblastoma (NBL) using univariate and step-up analysis. We measured recovery by times to achieve (1) white blood cell counts greater than 1,000/microL; (2) absolute neutrophil counts greater than 500/microL; and (3) platelet counts greater than 20,000/microL without transfusion. In univariate analysis, recovery was significantly associated with the amount of prior chemotherapy and the interval between last chemotherapy and marrow harvest. Patient sex, the number of granulocyte-macrophage colonies infused, harvest-to-freeze interval, and use of purging were marginally associated. After adjusting for potential confounders in a multivariate model, the amounts of chemotherapy and granulocyte-macrophage colonies infused were independently significant predictors of time to total white blood cell count recovery; chemotherapy courses and chemo-to-harvest interval were predictors of neutrophil count recovery; and sex, use of purging, and harvest-to-freeze interval were marginal predictors of platelet recovery. The speed of hematologic recovery after ABMR seems to depend mainly on pre-existing factors and marginally on manipulation of the marrow after harvest. These factors may affect both proliferating and stromal cell pools.\r"

Mice were injected with 1.0 to 40.0 mg/kg/d CsA for 15 days. Thereafter, circulating Epo levels were evaluated in both intact animals and in mice made anemic with phenylhydrazine (PHZ). Serum Epo levels measured in CsA-treated animals were then compared with the predicted levels, which had been calculated in a reference population of normal, either intact or anemic, mice. In CsA-treated, intact animals both hematocrit and serum Epo levels were not significantly different from controls. However, serum Epo levels in CsA-treated, anemic mice were significantly lower than those expected in a control population of untreated, anemic mice with similar degrees of anemia. No significant increase in serum creatinine was recorded even at the highest doses of CsA used, nor were we able to document signs of renal toxicity by histologic examination of the kidneys. Therefore, therapeutical doses of CsA appear to affect the production of Epo under conditions in which the demand of the hormone is increased, as in response to anemia. We suggest that a subclinical kidney toxicity produced by CsA might have a role in the pathogenesis of the impaired Epo production observed in BMT patients, and may contribute to a delayed erythroid engraftment in at least some BMT patients.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred and eighty-two patients with congenital bleeding disorders received blood component replacement therapy between January 1979 and April 1985, were followed-up by the Puget Sound Blood Center's Hemophilia Care Program, and were tested for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Serologic results were obtained at least 1 year after the last exposure to volunteer donor products that were prepared before donor HIV screening or after the last exposure to concentrates produced before the manufacturer's use of treatment methods for inactivation of HIV. In all, 106 patients were anti-HIV positive. The risk of HIV infection was greater in patients with more severe bleeding tendencies, greater exposure to components, and exposure to lyophilized concentrates from large pools of donors. Of 100 patients with hemophilia A who only received cryoprecipitate from volunteer donors from Washington State (during the 6.3-year period), 14% had become anti-HIV positive. Of 27 patients receiving mostly cryoprecipitate but also being exposed to a single lot of concentrate during the same period, 13 (48%) were positive. Of 49 patients treated predominantly or solely with factor VIII concentrates during this period, 43 (88%) were anti-HIV positive. Of 29 patients with von Willebrand disease, four were anti-HIV positive, including 2 of 26 receiving only cryoprecipitate and two of three who had received a single dose of factor VIII concentrate. Of 19 patients who were treated solely with volunteer donor plasma, all remained anti-HIV negative. Of 47 patients exposed to factor IX concentrate, 28 (60%) were positive. Data relevant to the risk of HIV transmission subsequent to screening of the volunteer donor population were also obtained. Treatment records of 55 hemophilia A patients who have remained anti-HIV negative through at least June 1990 showed exposure to 71,173 screened donors from May 1985 through December 1989, and all 55 patients have remained anti-HIV negative.\r"

DESIGN--Case-control population based study. Data were obtained from interviews with patients with non-fatal myocardial infarction and their controls and with the next of kin of those who had died of coronary heart disease and their controls. SETTING--Auckland, New Zealand. SUBJECTS--Two groups of cases were studied. The first comprised 227 men and 72 women with non-fatal myocardial infarction identified from a population based surveillance programme for coronary heart disease; controls were 525 men and 341 women randomly selected from the same population group and matched for age and sex. The second group comprised 128 men and 30 women who had died of coronary heart disease and had been identified from the surveillance programme; controls were a sample of the previous control group and comprised 330 men and 214 women matched for age and sex. All participants were aged 25-64 years and without diagnosed coronary heart disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Regular alcohol consumption; high density lipoprotein cholesterol and low density lipoprotein concentrations. RESULTS--Men with myocardial infarction and men who had died of coronary heart disease were more likely to have been never drinkers (had never drunk more than once a month) than controls (18% v 12% and 23% v 13% respectively). After possible confounding factors had been controlled for, people in all categories of drinking (up to more than 56 drinks per week) had at least a 40% reduction in risk of fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease compared with never drinkers. Former drinkers also had a lower risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction than never drinkers (relative risks 0.41 and 0.10 in men and women respectively) but a similar risk of death from coronary heart disease. The reduction in risk was consistently greater in women than in men in all drinking categories but there was no clear dose-response effect in either sex. CONCLUSIONS--The results support the hypothesis that light and moderate alcohol consumption reduces the risk of coronary heart disease. This protective effect in this population was not due to the misclassification of former drinkers with a high risk of coronary heart disease as non-drinkers.\r"

POPULATION--7217 subjects who attended the screening phase; 3434 subjects positive on screening who attended the main examination for musculoskeletal disorders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Musculoskeletal, mental, and other symptoms detected by interview and questionnaire; results of standardised clinical examination of the musculoskeletal system; operational definition of fibromyalgia; mortality at 10 years. RESULTS--The prevalence of fibromyalgia was low (54 cases; 0.75%) and related to age (peak prevalence at 55-64 years), female sex (twice as prevalent in women), occupation (no cases among 1596 white collar professionals), level of education (strong inverse gradient), and high levels of physical stress at work. No significant associations were found with body mass index, smoking, or mental stress at work. The prevalence of fibromyalgia was sensitive to even minor modifications of the definition. Fibromyalgia was strongly coincident with many other disorders, especially musculoskeletal conditions. Fibromyalgia did not predict mortality. CONCLUSION--Descriptive epidemiological data offer little support for the concept of fibromyalgia.\r"

DESIGN--The family health services authorities were treated as discrete primary health care systems. Nineteen performance indicators reflecting the size, distribution, and characteristics of the population served; the organisation of general practice (inputs); and the activities generated by general practitioners and their staff (output) were analysed by stepwise regression. SETTING--90 family health services authorities in England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Rates of cervical smear testing, immunisation, prescribing, and night visiting. RESULTS--53% of the variation in uptake of cervical cytology was accounted for by Jarman score (t = -3.3), list inflation (-0.41), the proportion of practitioners over 65 (-0.64), the number of ancillary staff per practitioner (2.5), and 70% of the variation in immunisation rates by standardised mortality ratios (-6.6), the proportion of practitioners aged over 65 (-4.8), and the number of practice nurses per practitioner (3.5). Standardised mortality ratios (8.4), the number of practitioners (2.3), and the proportion over 65 (2.2), and the number of ancillary staff per practitioner (-3.1) accounted for 69% of variation in prescribing rates. 54% of the variation in night visiting was explained by standardised mortality ratios (7.1), the proportion of practitioners with lists sizes below 1000 (-2.2), the proportion aged over 65 (-0.4), and the number of practice nurses per practitioner (-2.5). CONCLUSIONS--Family health services authorities are appropriate systems for studying output of general practice. Their performance indicators need to be refined and to be linked to other relevant factors, notably the performance of hospital, community, and social services.\r"

DESIGN--Survey by postal questionnaire. SUBJECTS--General managers of all family health services authorities in England and Wales; all general practitioners in Yorkshire and Humberside. RESULTS--Managers of 80 of 93 family health services authorities replied (86%). A total of 62 (78%) found local community paediatricians helpful in compiling criteria for admission to child health surveillance lists, and 46 (57%) found national guidelines helpful. Fifty seven (71%) accepted general practitioners who had completed an approved course, and 45 (56%) accepted those with three or more years' experience of child health surveillance. Of the 1966 questionnaires sent to general practitioners, 1233 were satisfactorily completed (63%). Of the 919 respondents who had applied to be put on child health surveillance lists, 673 (73%) had been permanently accepted; of these, 441 (65%) had done an approved course and 375 (56%) had had three or more years' experience of child health surveillance. Of the 145 (16%) not accepted, 57 (39%) had done an approved course and 71 (49%) had three or more years' experience. Respondents reported variable quality and availability of courses in child health.

The T1 data from all the pixels sampled from lumbar vertebral marrow are displayed as a histogram. By \"thresholding\" relative to normal control data the spatial distribution of high or low T1 pixels can be demonstrated. The approach is superior to that of the conventional region of interest method for quantifying and analysing relaxation time data, and allows tissue heterogeneity to be studied. Studies in patients with aplastic anaemia and acute leukaemia have been performed.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic (CT) staging were in agreement in 16 out of the 17 patients where both were performed. In one case, CT suggested hepatic invasion but this was found not to be present on MRI and at operation. Magnetic resonance imaging also provided substantial additional information in three patients, including two cases where MRI demonstrated a patent IVC that appeared occluded on CT (one of which also had vertebral metastases seen on MRI but missed on CT) and one case where CT failed to demonstrate minimal involvement of the IVC. Magnetic resonance imaging is an accurate means of staging renal cell carcinoma with clear advantages over CT. In no case in this series was inferior vena cavography found to be necessary.\r"

Diagnostic quality DSA images were obtained in 21 out of 27 intravenous and nine out of 11 intra-arterial studies. Obstructive lesions were present in all the patients and commonly involved the abdominal aorta (24 patients) and renal arteries (20 patients). Aneurysms were seen in five patients and predominantly involved the descending thoracic aorta. Pulmonary artery involvement was uncommon (five out of 20 patients) and clinically silent. Based on clinical and angiographic features, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed for the management of uncontrolled hypertension in eight patients (10 lesions). Initial success was obtained in eight procedures (80%). Re-stenosis occurred after 5.5 months in one patient, but was successfully re-dilated. The follow-up period ranged between 5 and 16 months (mean 9 months). Long-term efficacy of transluminal angioplasty in the management of these children is awaited.\r"

The helically shaped tip provides the needle with a number of potential advantages over other currently available localization needles. During in vitro comparisons with other needles quantitative and qualitative evidence was obtained to suggest that the new needle can be expected to have improved anchoring capability, be deflected less by tough fibrous tissue interfaces and be more visible sonographically. The anchoring wire can also be retracted and repositioned. Preliminary clinical experience with the needle was consistent with these expectations.\r"

  ".W": "In the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, perfusion lung scintigraphy offers high sensitivity but low specificity. The specificity can be significantly increased by the use of combined ventilation and perfusion studies. Most aspects of perfusion lung scintigraphy are uniformly accepted but the technique of ventilation imaging varies from centre to centre. This study describes a new technique for the performance of ventilation scintigraphy using a suspension of ultrafine carbon particles labelled with 99Tcm (\"Technegas\"). The technique combines the ready availability of 99Tcm and its optimal imaging properties with an easily administered radiopharmaceutical of particle size sufficiently small to deposit in the alveoli. Of 63 patients studied by conventional perfusion scintigraphy plus Technegas ventilation scintigraphy, images of diagnostic quality were obtained in all. 31 of these patients also had a ventilation study using 81Krm gas and in only one instance did the two methods of ventilation imaging lead to differing interpretations. We conclude that high quality diagnostic images may be obtained using this new technique, which can be made available on both a routine and an emergency basis, thus improving the service provided for patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism.\r"

Changes in body weight, after single and fractionated X-ray doses (8 fractions in 8 or 15 days and 4 fractions in 4 or 13 days), were recorded and the nadir of weight loss for each regime was used as the end-point. In our studies, quantal and non-quantal analyses of the weight loss data gave good dose-response relationships. The shapes of the dose-effect curves for single doses, 4F/4 days and 8F/8 days showed a remarkable degree of radioresistance, which became less apparent when the overall time was increased to 13 and 15 days for 4 and 8 fractions, respectively. The alpha/beta values (7-17 Gy) are within the range found for other acutely responding normal tissues. Histopathological changes were also assessed and the structural changes observed in the oesophageal epithelium, after a single dose of 34 Gy or after 46 Gy given as 3F/6 days, correlated with the gross changes observed in body weight.\r"

Asymptomatic haemangiomas do not require treatment. Renal haemangioma. In all, 198 cases have been reported. The lesion is usually solitary and unilateral and occurs most often in the pyramid, and in the mucosa or subepithelial tissue of the pelvis. In some cases a tentative diagnosis of haemangioma has been made by means of selective renal angiography and pre- or per-operative renoscopy. Partial nephrectomy is recommended in cases of minor haemangioma. Ureteric haemangioma. Six cases have been described. When haemangioma is suspected a conservative operation is recommended. Bladder haemangioma. A total of 106 cases have been reported. Many of the tumours had the characteristics of an iceberg, with considerable extravesical extension making endoscopic management less suitable because of the possibility of massive haemorrhage or recurrence. Consequently, many authors prefer local excision. In the case of endoscopic treatment the patient should be prepared for open surgery. Urethral haemangioma. Twenty cases have been described. The lesions often extend further than is immediately apparent. Endoscopic management is recommended for small lesions and, in the case of more extensive lesions, open exploration is advised followed by appropriate urethral reconstruction.\r"

The causes of chronic renal failure were bilateral staghorn calculi, staghorn calculi and contralateral urinary calculi, and chronic pyelonephritis of the contralateral kidney. The morbidity and mortality rates following conservative treatment were higher than those following surgical management. The pathological findings in 47 kidneys after nephrectomy showed severe hydronephrosis, renal abscess and xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. These results indicated that staghorn calculi destroyed the kidney and early complete removal of these stones is advisable.\r"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of sodium-potassium citrate to inhibit calcium oxalate crystal nucleation and growth on to stone fragments remaining after ESWL. The continuous flow crystallisation technique was adapted to induce calcium oxalate crystal nucleation and growth on to the surface of fragmented kidney stones and the inhibitory effect of sodium-potassium citrate was assessed by scanning electron microscopy and by determining the relative increase in crystalline mass at final concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 mmol/l. Sodium-potassium citrate significantly inhibited the deposition of new crystalline calcium oxalate in a dose-dependent manner above 2 mmol/l; these findings were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. It was concluded that sodium-potassium citrate may provide an effective means of preventing the formation of new kidney stones by the deposition of calcium oxalate on to residual stone fragments resulting from ESWL and that the technique used is an efficient means of testing the efficacy of therapeutic agents to prevent stone recurrence in patients treated with ESWL.\r"

Detrusor instability (DI) was found on AM in 31 patients who were not unstable on conventional CMG using the criteria of the International Continence Society: DI was diagnosed on filling in 20 patients and on provocation in a further 11. Incontinence was demonstrated by electronic nappy testing in 23 patients: 13 had urge incontinence due to DI, 7 had genuine stress incontinence alone and 3 had both genuine stress incontinence and detrusor instability. Thus DI was diagnosed significantly more frequently by AM than by CMG. Ambulatory monitoring was more sensitive in the diagnosis of instability and incontinence and it may prove to be a valuable aid in the diagnosis of bladder dysfunction not detected during conventional cystometry.\r"

Because of this experience the second group of patients had routine biopsy of the trigone and assessment of urethral sensation as part of the initial assessment. In those in whom the trigone was unaffected, treatment was unchanged. If the trigone was affected, total cystourethrectomy was performed with substitution cystourethroplasty unless the patient chose or was advised to avoid surgery altogether or to have a simpler option such as conduit or continent urinary diversion. Trigonal biopsies should be part of the routine assessment of all patients being considered for surgery, since residual active disease is a major cause of dissatisfaction after subtotal cystectomy and substitution cystoplasty.\r"

Serial transverse sonograms were compared with whole-mount step-sections of the prostatectomy specimens to evaluate the sonographic features of irradiated prostate cancer. To define more clearly the effects of radiation on malignant prostatic tissue, we assessed the degree of histological change induced by the irradiation (radiation effects) as none, mild, moderate or severe. A total of 121 areas of cancer greater than 4 mm in maximum diameter were identified on the histological sections. Of these, 105 (87%) showed no radiation effects or mild effects, and 72% (76/105) of these appeared hypoechoic on the corresponding sonogram. There were 16 foci with moderate or severe radiation effects and only 25% (4/16) appeared hypoechoic. The remaining 12 foci were isoechoic. Areas of cancer which show moderate or severe radiation effects tend to become isoechoic while large (greater than 4 mm) foci of cancer in the irradiated prostate usually show little radiation effect, and these foci typically appear hypoechoic.\r"

Cavernosal artery measurements were taken before and after the intracorporeal injection of papaverine. The peak velocities following papaverine injection correlated well with the degree of clinical response. Percentage diameter change corresponded with some groups of clinical erection grade, although it was not as good a discriminator as peak velocity. Twelve patients with 24 cavernosal arteries were also examined using pharmacological selective arteriography. Correlation between duplex sonography and arteriography showed an accuracy of 87.5%, specificity of 100.0% and sensitivity of 82.4%. All patients with a clinically good response following papaverine injection had peak bilateral cavernosal artery velocities greater than or equal to 25 cm/s. Amongst the remaining suboptimal responders, 18 also had this finding. Fifteen of these underwent pharmacological cavernosography and 14 exhibited venous leakage. Duplex sonography is a valuable and non-invasive tool in the assessment of impotence and can provide valuable information in deciding the course of further evaluation and treatment. The procedure was always completed more quickly with the guidance of colour Doppler.\r"

Since 1980, 124 patients with seminoma of the testis have been referred to this institution; 97 of 116 patients analysed presented with stage I disease and 10 of these had elevated levels of beta HCG. A total of 64 patients were given radiotherapy after orchiectomy and 33 entered a surveillance protocol. After a median follow-up of 48 months, 3 patients in the surveillance group relapsed after 5, 13 and 49 months and 2 of the irradiated patients did so after 25 and 33 months. Elevation of beta HCG was not significant because none of these patients showed progression. A low rate of progression and excellent survival are associated with standard treatment (orchiectomy and radiotherapy) and good results have been achieved with chemotherapy in cases of relapse. A surveillance policy is not recommended in stage I seminoma because of its slower growth compared with non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT), the absence of a specific tumour marker, the 10% risk of occult metastases and the 3-fold higher progression rate compared with irradiated patients. We suggest the use of a reduced dosage and radiation field.\r"

Infection stones occurred earliest and more commonly in males and were usually upper tract struvite calculi related to Proteus infection. Anatomical stones were most commonly associated with pelviureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction and had a high recurrence rate, despite surgical correction of obstruction. Idiopathic stones most resembled those found in adult urolithiasis by virtue of occurring latest, being sited in the ureter more often and being more frequently composed of calcium oxalate. Metabolic stones were most frequently calcium phosphate or cystine and virtually all were renal. They comprised the smallest group but had the highest recurrence rate.\r"

We report a series of investigations on a simultanagnosic patient which attempt to establish the nature of this visual processing disturbance. The patient performed normally on a feature detection task but was impaired on a test of attention-requiring visual search in which she was asked to distinguish between stimuli containing different numbers of targets. She was not impaired on a visual-spatial orienting task. She identified single briefly presented words and objects as rapidly and reliably as controls suggesting that access to stored structural descriptions was not impaired. With brief, simultaneous presentation of 2 words or drawings, she identified both stimuli significantly more frequently when the stimuli were semantically related than when they were unrelated. On the basis of these and other data, we suggest that the patient's simultanagnosia is attributable to an impairment in the process by which activated structural descriptions are linked to information coding the location of the object.\r"

  ".W": "A comparison of naming performance, on the Boston Naming Test, of 52 patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), 16 patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and 52 normal control subjects was performed using a comprehensive classification of error types. Spontaneous and cued naming scores were significantly impaired both in the DAT and HD groups, but performance in the DAT patients was significantly worse than that of the HD patients. Normal controls made predominantly semantic-category and circumlocutory errors. The HD group differed from normal only in the proportion of visually based errors, which was greater in the patient group. By contrast, the DAT patients made a significantly greater proportion of semantic-superordinate and semantic-associative errors. The same pattern of naming errors was found when a group of DAT and HD patients matched for overall naming ability was compared. A subgroup of 22 DAT patients was followed longitudinally over 3 y. Their deterioration in overall naming performance was accompanied by a consistent change in the profile of naming errors: the proportion of semantic-associative errors increased significantly as did the proportion of visual errors. These results are considered in the light of current cognitive models of naming. They suggest that in HD, naming deficits initially involve disruption of perceptual analysis, whereas in DAT such impairments in the early stages reflect a breakdown in semantic processes. However, as DAT progresses, perceptual problems also begin to contribute to the patients' naming difficulties. Postlexical (phonemic) processes remain relatively intact throughout in both diseases.\r"

The mean age of onset in EOCA was 15.9 +/- 6.0 yrs (FA: 14.0 +/- 5.7 yrs). Annual progression rate and the percentage of patients who were wheelchair-bound was lower in EOCA as compared with FA, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. The latency until becoming wheelchair-bound, however, was significantly longer in EOCA than in FA. The segregation ratio in EOCA was significantly lower than 0.25. Clinically, EOCA and FA patients presented with a progressive cerebellar syndrome. Associated symptoms, such as muscle wasting, sensory disturbances, foot deformity, scoliosis and electrocardiographic abnormalities were encountered less frequently in EOCA than in FA patients. The electrophysiological findings in EOCA were variable and pointed to axonal degeneration in peripheral nerves and central pathways. Posturographic measurements revealed a higher incidence of anteroposterior sway direction in EOCA as compared with FA, suggesting a cerebellar type of ataxia in EOCA. Eleven out of the 14 EOCA patients had cerebellar atrophy in MRI. The characteristic MRI finding in FA was upper cervical cord shrinkage and only minor atrophy of the cerebellum. The demonstration of cerebellar atrophy in the majority of EOCA patients supports the view that EOCA is distinct from FA. It is uncertain, however, whether EOCA is a homogenous disease entity or a group of phenotypically similar syndromes.\r"

Forty right brain-lesioned patients, 28 of whom revealed mild, moderate, or severe neglect in clock drawing and cancellation tasks, were asked to search for concealed targets on a stimulus display board, by either (1) moving a covering panel with a small window until the target appeared, or (2) moving the stimulus display board beneath a stationary covering panel until the target became visible through the window. In the second procedure, the direction of physical space exploration and hand movement is reversed, so that in order to bring a target from the right side of the stimulus into view (under the window) the entire display board had to be moved to the left. This pair of procedures was supplemented by an analogous pair of visual tasks in which the entire display board was visible during the search. As expected, response times were generally longer for targets located on the left side of the display board; however, the direction of required hand movement (left vs right) did not have a significant effect on response times, irrespective of the degree of clinically assessed neglect.\r"

In 8 patients with localized impairment of pain and temperature sensitivity we found complete absence of SEPc after stimulation of the affected area; in another patient with similar sensory deficits, the SEPc was grossly attenuated and delayed. In 1 patient with intact pain sensitivity but absent temperature sensitivity, a well defined SEPc could be recorded. Both early cortical SEPn and late SEPn in response to conventional nerve stimuli were normal in all patients and thus did not differentiate control and affected areas. These data indicate that alteration of SEPc correlates with altered pain sensitivity in patients with a circumscribed spinal lesion. SEPc may thus be used as a neurophysiological test in the assessment of hypalgesic dermatomes.\r"

Recent advances in radiobiological and toxicological evaluation of tumour-affinitive boron-containing drugs and in optimization of the energies of neutrons in the incident beam have spurred interest in BNCT. This article presents a history of BNCT that emphasizes studies in the USA. A new dosimetric analysis of the 1959-1961 clinical trials of BNCT at Brookhaven National Laboratory is also presented. This analysis yields an acute radiation dose tolerance limit estimate of approximately 10 Gy-Eq to the capillary endothelium of human basal ganglia from BNCT. (Gy-Eq: Gray-equivalent, or relative biological effectiveness of a radiation component multiplied by the physical dose of the component (Gy), summed over the component kinds of radiation.)\r"

  ".W": "This case study reports the profile of preserved and impaired capacities in a left-handed patient suffering from primary degenerative dementia of unknown aetiology. She was remarkable because her relatively preserved object naming and semantic categorization abilities contrasted with severe deficits in speech fluency, oral reading, inability to execute spoken and written commands, and severely impaired auditory-verbal short-term memory. Her reading disorder could be characterized as a disturbance of assembled phonology. She had great difficulty reading pronounceable nonwords, but she could correctly read irregular words. She showed effects of word imageability or concreteness (more than word frequency). She also showed effects of part-of-speech, where nouns and adjectives were read more easily than inflected verbs. She had difficulty reading function words. The syntactic category effects could be proven (by hierarchical log-linear analysis) not to be an artefact of imageability differences between verbs, adjectives and nouns. In reading aloud she made visual and morphological errors, but no semantic errors. This interesting pattern of preserved semantic information and disrupted phonological processing is unusual in dementia and contrasts with the severe dysnomia of patients with surface dyslexia who are able to read by the indirect, assembly-of-phonology route and show better reading of nonwords than irregular words. Her reading by a direct visual-semantic route appeared to be associated with relatively intact object naming, concrete word reading, and irregular word reading. This selective impairment of phonological reading in the context of partly preserved semantic abilities was interpreted as confirmation of the dissociability of language functions in primary degenerative dementia.\r"

The ERPs comprised two components, an N400 and a P600, and were similar in morphology to the previously reported ERP to verbal recognition memory tasks. The two ERP components in both verbal and visuospatial tasks were dependent on stimulus type and our data suggest that they do not simply represent delayed P300 ERP responses. In 17/20 patients robust, reliable bilaterally present ERPs were elicited by both verbal and visuospatial memory tasks. N400 amplitude was larger in response to novel stimuli, whereas P600 amplitude was larger to repeated stimuli. P600 amplitude was larger in the right temporal lobe to both visuospatial and verbal stimulus material. N400 and P600 latencies did not vary with task, stimulus type or side of recording. In 3/20 patients, no ERPs were elicited by either memory task. In all 3 cases, unilateral temporal white matter abnormalities were demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioural measures, expressed in the form of standardized accuracy scores, did not differ from those of a normal control group, and hence are unlikely to account for the abnormalities in ERPs. These results are discussed with reference to the primate visual recognition memory pathway and suggest that ERPs to recognition memory tasks are generated by an interaction between the two homologous inferotemporal recognition memory pathways.\r"

The movement sequence was predictable and had to be performed within specified time restraints. We recorded the activity of 297 neurons whose discharges were related to the movement task. We included only neurons whose discharges were related to movements at or about the wrist joint by prior examination outside the behavioural paradigm. Each neuron discharged preferentially to one direction of movement at or about the wrist joint. No consistent correlation was found between neuronal discharge and initial joint position, static load application, amplitude of movement or velocity of movement. The mean onset of neuronal discharge was 2 ms after the onset of EMG activity. The findings implied little contribution from the pallidal neurons in the execution of the current movement or to the movement's parameters. The implications are that the basal ganglia are likely to be concerned with other aspects of movement control.\r"

  ".W": "In order to study the role of the basal ganglia (BG) in cognitive aspects of movement, we recorded extracellularly from pallidal neurons in conscious monkeys while they performed a sequential wrist movement task consisting of a series of holds and ballistic jumps. The movement sequence had to be performed within specified time restraints and was predictable. We recorded the activity of 297 neurons whose discharges were related to the movement task. The movement-related response was found to be influenced by the contextual setting and by the degree of difficulty of the task in a subgroup of 82 neurons with a clear response to the first ballistic movement. Predictable and easy movements were usually represented by more prominent movement-related responses in 46% of these neurons; 35% of neurons from a different subset of 105 neurons also demonstrated a second phasic response just before the end of the final hold period of the task. This response was also found to be influenced by the predictability of the final hold period, both in its time duration and also by the direction of the following ballistic movement in double jump tasks. These findings were in keeping with a cognitive role for the BG in movement performance. In particular we suggest that the phasic neuronal activity was an internal cue generated by the BG for predictable movements of a subconscious nature which signals the end of a component of movement in a movement sequence. This cue is appropriately timed to terminate sustained neuronal activity in the SMA and to allow the next movement in the sequence to be executed.\r"

The first patient experienced scintillations in the left lower quadrant, leading to the discovery of an astrocytoma in the cuneus of the right occipital lobe. Postoperatively she had a left lower quadrantanopia that precisely respected the horizontal meridian. The second patient presented with a left lower quadrantanopia, sparing the central 10 degrees of vision that also respected the horizontal meridian. An astrocytoma was resected from the right upper peristriate cortex. We must explain how a lesion in extrastriate cortex produced a homonymous field defect with a sharp horizontal edge in these 2 patients. Areas V2 and V3 are each divided along the horizontal meridian into separate halves flanking striate cortex. Consequently, the upper and lower quadrants in extrastriate cortex are physically isolated on opposite sides of striate cortex. We propose that a lesion involving V2/V3 may be sufficient to create a visual field defect. Although the lesion may have irregular margins, if it crosses the representation of the horizontal meridian in extrastriate cortex, it will produce a quadrantic visual field defect with a sharp horizontal border because of the split layout of the upper and lower quadrants in V2/V3.\r"

Three to four weeks after a left hemisphere stroke, 17 patients were completely unable to communicate with people addressing them. Though there were differences in their willingness to interact with the environment, they were characterized by complete loss of speech output and by inaccessibility to any kind of message, whether given verbally or through gestures. Patients who survived were reassessed 6 and 12 mos later and half of them were still found in a state of complete communicative isolation. The remainder had somewhat improved, but remained globally aphasic. The attempt to find a CT scan basis for this picture was disappointing. Only 35% of patients had a lesional pattern in agreement with the traditional view that ascribes global aphasia to the involvement of Broca's and Wernicke's areas. The location of lesion in the other cases spanned from anterior cortical damage, to posterior cortical damage, to deep nuclei damage and none of the lesions that have been proposed to account for subcortical global aphasia was consistently observed.\r"

  ".W": "A 'time-on' theory to explain the cerebral distinction between conscious and unconscious mental functions proposes that a substantial minimum duration ('time-on') of appropriate neuronal activations up to about 0.5 s is required to elicit conscious sensory experience, but that durations distinctly below that minimum can mediate sensory detection without awareness. A direct experimental test of this proposal is reported here. Stimuli (72 pulses/s) above and below such minimum train durations (0-750 ms) were delivered to the ventrobasal thalamus via electrodes chronically implanted for the therapeutic control of intractable pain. Detection was measured by the subject's forced choice as to stimulus delivery in one of two intervals, regardless of any presence or absence of sensory awareness. Subjects also indicated their awareness level of any stimulus-induced sensation in each and every trial. The results show (1) that detection (correct greater than 50%) occurred even with stimulus durations too brief to elicit awareness, and (2) that to move from mere detection to even an uncertain and often questionable sensory awareness required a significantly larger additional duration of pulses. Thus simply increasing duration ('time-on') of the same repetitive inputs to cerebral cortex can convert an unconscious cognitive mental function (detection without awareness) to a conscious one (detection with awareness).\r"

The number of binding sites of 3H-NMS (Bmax) was significantly decreased both in early and late onset AD groups as compared with age-matched controls, by 54% and 40%, respectively, whereas the apparent binding affinity (Kd) was the same in all disease and control groups. In addition, the average Bmax in early AD was significantly lower than in late AD. The density of the binding of 3H-NMS was also significantly lower in a subgroup of old subjects with Down's syndrome (DS), whereas no changes were found in younger individuals with DS or in patients with Parkinson's disease, whether they were demented or not, multi-infarct dementia, myasthenia gravis or epilepsy. In the AD group, the difference in binding sites was unrelated either to the severity of dementia or disease duration. Treatment of the patients with cholinergic agents did not alter the binding values in any of the examined group. We conclude that the alteration of lymphocyte muscarinic receptors is highly associated with AD, but whether this reflects the central cholinergic deficit in these patients is uncertain.\r"

Single motor unit (MU) F responses to threshold stimulation of the ulnar nerve were recorded with bipolar needle electrodes (BNE); the mean latencies of their fastest associated surface single unit M and F potentials were similar to those of the compound muscle action potential and fastest F wave, indicating that the fastest F wave indexes adequately the fastest motor fibre of the ulnar nerve. The mean surface unit F amplitude of MUs recorded by a BNE was similar to that of voluntary MUs recorded with a spike-triggered averaging technique; an estimated mean of 2-3 MUs per F wave was found by two methods. The frequency distribution of estimated F wave CVs was shifted towards faster values than expected from available studies of the distribution of CVs in single peripheral nerves; it was also higher than predicted from the expected relation between this distribution and the number of MUs per F wave, if an equal chance of activation and recording is assumed for each MU. There was a significant positive correlation between the frequency of F responses and their CV in 81 single MUs recorded by a BNE and tested with 200 threshold stimuli. These findings are consistent with preferential generation of recurrent responses by larger MUs; it may relate to a lesser chance of antidromic discharge in the smaller motor neurons and to a greater chance of collision of orthodromic (reflex) and antidromic impulses in their axons. The higher than expected percentage of all F waves that were repeater shapes or waves, and the presence of several distinct peaks in the distribution of intervals between repeaters of the same shape, suggest special, and heterogeneous, functional and anatomical arrangements in the groups of motor neurons generating them. Repeaters had greater amplitude and area, but similar latency and duration, than F wave shapes that did not repeat, suggesting that the former have a larger number of component MUs.\r"

  ".W": "Six normal volunteers were studied with positron emission tomography to identify the cortical neural networks that participate in the processing of single words. Activity-related changes in regional cerebral blood flow were measured consecutively on 6 occasions in each subject, 2 while the subject was at rest and 4 while single word language tasks were being performed. The data from each subject were standardized for brain shape and size, reconstructed parallel to the intercommissural line, normalized for global flow differences, and then averaged for each activation condition across the 6 subjects. Significant areas of change in rCBF (P less than 0.05, with appropriate Bonferroni corrections) between task and rest conditions were displayed with reference to the coordinates of a standard neuroanatomical atlas. We have demonstrated that categorical judgements on heard pairs of real words activate neural networks along both superior temporal gyri, but with an anatomical distribution no different from that seen when the subjects listened to nonwords: the tasks would appear to be very different in cognitive demands but not in terms of the distribution of activation. However, during a verb generation task that involved thinking of verbs appropriate to heard nouns presented at a slow rate, the only temporal region activated was the left posterior superior temporal association cortex (Wernicke's area). Further analysis showed that whereas activation in other superior temporal regions, both left and right, correlated with rates of word presentation during the 4 tasks, there was no such correlation in Wernicke's area; evidence that this site is responsible for more than early acoustic processing. During verb generation there was also activation of left premotor and prefrontal cortex (including Broca's area and the supplementary motor area). The supplementary motor area is thought to be involved in the motor planning of speech. The subjects did not vocalize during the task, and therefore it would appear that the act of retrieving words from semantic memory activates networks concerned with the production of speech sounds. We conclude that single word comprehension and retrieval activate very different distributed regions of cerebral cortex, with Wernicke's area the only region engaged by both processes and with participation during silent word generation of networks involved in vocalization.\r"

(3) The artefactual threshold elevation recorded through the method of limits corresponds precisely to the reaction time. (4) Conduction velocities for the primary afferents mediating the sensations of warm and cold, calculated on the basis of reaction time and conduction distance are in keeping with the mediation of warm sensation by unmyelinated primary afferents and of cold sensation by small myelinated afferents. (5) Measurement of threshold by the method of levels and direct measurement of reaction time enables calculation of conduction velocity for the specific sensory submodality tested from a single stimulation site.\r"

  ".W": "Electrophysiological studies were performed in Lewis rats with chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by inoculation with guinea-pig spinal cord and adjuvants and treatment with low dose cyclosporin A. During clinical episodes there was conduction failure in the central nervous system (CNS), namely the spinal cord dorsal columns, and in the afferent fibres in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The following observations indicated that the conduction failure was mainly due to demyelination-induced conduction block: (1) rate-dependent conduction block in the CNS and PNS; (2) temporal dispersion due to slowing of PNS conduction; (3) restoration of PNS conduction by cooling; (4) restoration of CNS conduction by ouabain; (5) previously demonstrated histological evidence of primary demyelination in the dorsal columns, dorsal root ganglia and dorsal roots; and (6) the temporal association of restoration of conduction with remyelination. However, it is likely that CNS and PNS axonal degeneration, which occurs in this disease, also contributed to the conduction failure. In clinical remissions there was restoration of conduction in the CNS and PNS which can be explained by ensheathment/remyelination by oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, respectively. In most rats during clinical episodes the cerebral somatosensory evoked potential was reduced in amplitude and prolonged in latency, which can be accounted for by demyelination and axonal degeneration in the CNS and PNS components of the afferent pathway. In 2 rats with episodes of EAE, however, this potential was markedly increased in amplitude, which might have been due to demyelination-induced conduction block of descending pathways that normally inhibit synaptic transmission in the afferent pathway. In well-established remission there was residual conduction failure in the CNS and PNS which can be mainly accounted for by axonal degeneration.\r"

Based on the presented data and literature reports a condition is distinguished, which is in clinical, genetic and morphological aspects different from autosomal dominant HMSN type II. The condition corresponds to that described by Ouvrier et al. (1981). It shows a congenital or early childhood onset and causes a severe disability usually with wheelchair dependency already in puberty or later in adult life. The condition is probably transmitted by an autosomal recessive gene. Morphological features of biopsied nerves are an extensive loss of large diameter fibres with a shift to smaller diameters in the histogram. Regenerative features are almost absent in contrast to the distinct cluster formation in autosomal dominant HMSN type II. A maturation disturbance of peripheral motor and sensory neurons with a concomitant or secondary process of chronic neuronal degeneration is suggested. One dominantly inherited case in our group with an infantile onset exhibits clinical and morphological features consistent with an autosomal dominant HMSN type II.\r"

Unlike clinical examination using a pin or needle, pain SEP is considered to be an objective and quantitative test to investigate functions of peripheral and central sensory pathways responsible for pain-temperature sensation (A delta fibres and the spinothalamic tract). Pain SEPs were abnormal in all patients. The results were generally compatible with the degree of a clinical impairment of pain-temperature sensation. Subclinical abnormality was detected in 3 patients. Electric median nerve SEPs using the scalp reference (Fz) were normal in 6 out of 8 patients. However, anterior and posterior cervical responses using a noncephalic reference were absent or small in 7 patients. Electric SEPs following tibial nerve stimulation were normal in 7 patients. These findings suggest that the function of the ascending fibres through the dorsal columns is intact in most patients, whereas the dorsal horn, where a fixed cervical potential is generated, is impaired. Pain SEPs combined with electric SEPs therefore appear to be extremely useful for investigating physiological function in the sensory pathways in patients who show 'dissociated sensory loss' such as in syringomyelia.\r"

Reflex EMG activity was recorded first in orbicularis oculi. This was of similar latency to the normal auditory blink reflex and, unlike the generalized startle response, persisted despite the frequent presentation of the test stimulus. It is argued that this early latency activity in orbicularis oculi represents a normal auditory blink reflex and is not part of the generalized auditory startle reflex. With the exception of this early latency activity in orbicularis oculi, the relative latencies of both cranial and distal muscles in the auditory startle response increased with the distance of their respective segmental innervations from the caudal brainstem. Thus the earliest EMG activity was recorded in sternocleidomastoid. The recruitment of caudal muscles was relatively slow and the latencies of the intrinsic hand muscles were disproportionately long. The pattern of recruitment of cranial muscles suggests a brainstem origin for the normal startle response. Studies on the auditory startle reflex in animals are reviewed in the light of this finding.\r"

  ".W": "The startle response to unexpected auditory and somaesthetic stimulation was studied in 8 patients with hereditary or symptomatic hyperekplexia. It was abnormal in its resistance to habituation and in its exaggerated motor response. Both noise and taps to the face and head elicited a normal early blink response, separate from the subsequent true startle reflex. The earliest reflex EMG activity recorded after the blink was in sternocleidomastoid. EMG activity in masseter, and trunk and limb muscles followed later. This pattern of muscle recruitment suggests a brainstem origin for the abnormal startle responses. In addition, the abnormal startle responses exhibited disproportionately long latencies to the intrinsic hand and foot muscles and relatively slow recruitment of caudal muscles. The pattern of muscle recruitment was similar between patients, irrespective of the absolute latency of the response, and regardless of whether stimulation was auditory or somaesthetic. This suggests that auditory and somaesthetic afferents converge on a common brainstem efferent system, and that this system forms the final common pathway for abnormal startle responses of differing latency. The characteristics of this efferent system differ from those previously described in brainstem reticular reflex myoclonus, but are similar to those described in the normal auditory startle reflex in man. This suggests that the abnormal startle response in hyperekplexia, and the normal startle reflex represent pathological and physiological activity in the same brainstem efferent system.\r"

The density of myelinated fibres ranged from 25 to 7880 per mm2 (n = 8470 +/- 706 (SD]. There was a marked inequality in the density of nerve fibres between the fascicles of individual nerves with a mean coefficient of variation of 41 +/- 37 (SD) % versus 7.4 +/- 3.0% in controls. Loss of myelinated fibres, which was greater for fibres larger than 7 microns in diameter, was more severe than that for unmyelinated axons. Regeneration, which was assessed by the number of clustered axons, decreased when the density of myelinated fibres decreased, suggesting that severe nerve ischaemia precludes axonal regeneration. Wallerian degeneration affected on average 58% (range 5-100%) and segmental demyelination, mainly of the secondary type, on average 1.94% (range 1-10%) of teased fibres. It was concluded that (1) myelinated fibres are more vulnerable to ischaemia than unmyelinated axons; (2) large myelinated fibres are affected before the smaller ones; (3) segmental demyelination is uncommon in this context; (4) severe nerve ischaemia precludes axonal regeneration.\r"

  ".W": "Levels of iron, copper, zinc and manganese were measured by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy in frozen postmortem brain tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy with strionigral degeneration (MSA), and Huntington's disease (HD) compared with control subjects. Total iron levels were found to be elevated in the areas of basal ganglia showing pathological change in these disorders. In particular, total iron content was increased in substantia nigra in PD, PSP and MSA, but not in HD. Total iron levels in the striatum (putamen and/or caudate nucleus) were increased in PSP, MSA and HD but not in PD. Total iron levels were decreased in the globus pallidus in PD. There were no consistent alterations of manganese levels in basal ganglia structures in any of the diseases studied. Copper levels were decreased in the substantia nigra in PD, and in the cerebellum in PSP, and were elevated in the putamen and possibly substantia nigra in HD. Zinc levels were only increased in PD, in substantia nigra and in caudate nucleus and lateral putamen. Levels of the iron binding protein ferritin were measured in the same patient groups using a radio-immunoassay technique. Increased iron levels in basal ganglia were generally associated with normal or elevated levels of ferritin immunoreactivity, for example, the substantia nigra in PSP and possibly MSA, and in putamen in MSA. The exception was PD where there was a generalized reduction in brain ferritin immunoreactivity, even in the substantia nigra. An increase in total iron content appears to be a response to neurodegeneration in affected basal ganglia regions in a number of movement disorders. However, only in PD was there an increased total iron level, decreased ferritin content, decreased copper content, and an increased zinc concentration in substantia nigra. These findings suggest an alteration of iron handling in the substantia nigra in PD. Depending on the form in which the excess iron load exists in nigra in PD, it may contribute to the neurodegenerative process.\r"

A left-handed man with a history of phonological developmental dyslexia and dysgraphia learned in early adulthood to read and write using a lexical system. Following a small posterior right parietal infarct when aged 56 yrs he developed a severe agraphia displaying features of phonological dysgraphia with impaired segmentation and features of lexical agraphia. Writing was severely impaired for all classes of word and nonword stimuli but his errors did not resemble those attributable to a deficit in the system responsible for the short-term storage of the graphemic representation of a word (graphemic output buffer). These observations imply that an acquired lexical agraphia has been superimposed on his developmental phonological dysgraphia, resulting in a combined or 'phonolexical' agraphia.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examines which egocentric coordinate system determines the border between the disturbed 'contralateral' and the normal 'ipsilateral' side in patients with hemineglect. Based on the observation of significantly longer reaction times for saccades towards stimuli presented in the left visual field (LVF) in right brain-damaged patients with hemineglect, stimuli were presented randomly to the LVF or RVF and the corresponding saccadic reaction times (SRTs) were compared. Beginning with the standard body position generally used for the investigation of neglect patients, where the midlines of head, trunk and visual field are parallel and oriented straight towards the middle of the projection screen, the spatial relation between orientation of head and trunk midlines and location of the target stimuli was systematically varied while holding the retinal projection of the stimuli constant. The deficit in SRTs towards the LVF in 4 right brain-damaged patients with left-sided hemineglect could be compensated for by turning the patients' trunk to the left, such that both LVF and RVF-stimuli were projected to the right, ipsilateral side of trunk space. The results suggest that the spatial orientation of the trunk midline divides our normal perception of space into an egocentric 'left' and an egocentric 'right' sector and seems to be the decisive factor for determining the neglected 'contralateral' part of space in patients with brain-damage. They indicate that the trunk midline constitutes the physical anchor for calculation of the internal egocentric coordinate frame for representing body position with respect to external objects. The hypothesis of Ventre et al. (1984) that deficient reactions to contralaterally located stimuli in neglect patients could be the result of a displacement of these egocentric coordinates towards the non-neglected, ipsilateral side is discussed.\r"
