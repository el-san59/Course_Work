  ".W": "Nine children with osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis were treated sequentially with parenteral sulbactam/ampicillin and oral sultamicillin. Causative pathogens were identified in six cases; all were susceptible to the combination of ampicillin and sulbactam. The mean duration of parenteral therapy was 7.1 days (6-11 days), and the average hospital stay was 10.3 days (6-18 days). Peak serum bactericidal titers of greater than or equal to 1:8 were achieved in all patients during parenteral therapy; only one child receiving oral therapy did not achieve a titer of greater than or equal to 1:4. At follow-up, all of the children were cured clinically and there was no evidence of relapse. Adverse reactions to oral therapy were minimal. The regimen of parenteral sulbactam/ampicillin and oral sultamicillin used sequentially is effective and safe for the treatment of skeletal infections in children. The use of this approach significantly reduced the duration of hospitalization.\r"

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the proliferation of keratinocytes in culture, and topical administration of EGF accelerates epidermal regeneration of partial thickness burns or split-thickness incisions in vivo. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and vaccinia growth factor (VGF) have substantial sequence homology with EGF, and all appear to bind to the same receptor protein. Whether TGF-alpha or VGF can affect epidermal wound healing in vivo is not known. The present studies show that topical administration of TGF-alpha or VGF in antibiotic cream to partial thickness burns (second degree) accelerated epidermal regeneration in comparison with untreated or vehicle-treated burns. Low levels of both TGF-alpha and VGF (0.1 microgram per milliliter) appeared to be more effective than EGF in stimulating epidermal regeneration. Regenerated epithelium from burns treated with TGF-alpha or VGF appeared normal histologically. This finding suggests that topical application of selected growth factors may be useful in accelerating healing of partial thickness injuries.\r"

When bleeding could be stopped, the patients underwent full investigation and were then treated with either the distal splenorenal (DSR) shunt if the criteria of Warren were satisfied (group 2, n = 14) or with a modified Sugiura procedure in all other circumstances (group 3, n = 26). Patients were evaluated at 1.5 to 6 years. The rates for operative deaths, recurrent hemorrhage, encephalopathy, late deaths, and actuarial patient survival at 6 years were as follows: 20%, 30%, 30%, 20%, and 60% for group 1; 14.3%, 14.3%, 14.3%, 7.2%, and 79% for group 2; and 7.7%, 3.4%, 0%, 0%, and 93% for group 3, respectively. Within 3 months after the Sugiura operation, varices disappeared in 95% of patients and hypersplenism was relieved in all. Major complications were gastric and esophageal leaks in two patients (fatal in one) and temporary dysphagia in six. We conclude that the modified Sugiura nonshunt operation is probably the preferable treatment for variceal hemorrhage in the nonalcoholic patient because it is effective in arresting hemorrhage, has low operative mortality, low recurrence rate, no encephalopathy, and excellent survival rates.\r"

  ".W": "MR imaging is valuable in defining cardiac anatomy in a variety of cardiac abnormalities. However, evaluation of cardiac function by this technique has been limited by long imaging times and low temporal resolution. New, recently described pulse sequences shorten imaging time considerably and improve temporal resolution. This paper reports our early experience with cine MR imaging of the heart, a technique of gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state (GRASS) that uses low flip angles and gradient-recalled echoes. Images were obtained in 36 subjects (14 normal volunteers and 22 patients with coronary artery or valvular heart disease) and displayed in a cinegraphic mode for assessment of cardiac function. The acquisition of 10 to 12 levels, covering the whole heart with up to 24 time frames per level, required a maximum imaging time of only 30 min. Because systole and diastole were readily identified, and the contrast between blood and surrounding structures was excellent, systolic wall thickening, wall motion, and motion of the cardiac valves were visualized easily. Regions of myocardial infarcts were clearly visible and characterized by lack of systolic wall thickening and/or diastolic wall thinning. Turbulence caused signal loss within the flowing blood, which usually had higher signal intensity than myocardium. Therefore, turbulent blood flow in valvular regurgitation and in valvular and subvalvular stenosis could be detected. Cine MR imaging is a promising new technique for the evaluation of myocardial and valvular function.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the ability of MR to identify and characterize the region of myocardial infarction in humans. Twenty-nine patients, all with ECG and enzyme rises consistent with an acute myocardial infarction, were studied by MR 3-17 days from the onset of acute chest pain. Four patients were excluded because of inability to acquire adequate MR studies. For comparison, 20 normal subjects were studied who also had gated MR examinations. The site of infarction was visualized in 23 patients as an area of high signal intensity in relation to the normal myocardium, a contrast that increased on the second-echo image. The regions of abnormal signal intensity corresponded to the anatomic site of infarction as defined by the ECG changes. The mean T2 relaxation time of the infarcted myocardium (79 +/- 22 msec) was significantly prolonged in comparison with the mean T2 (43.9 +/- 9 msec) of normal myocardium (p less than .01). The mean percentage of contrast (intensity difference) between normal and infarcted myocardium was much greater on the second-echo images (65.6 +/- 34.0%) than the first-echo images (27.5 +/- 18.7%). In the normal subjects there was no difference in T2 between the anterolateral (40.3 +/- 5.7 msec) and septal (39.5 +/- 7.4 msec) regions, and percentages of contrast between these two regions of myocardium on the first-echo (9.1 +/- 7.4%) and second-echo (15.0 +/- 13.3%) images were similar. Thus, MR can be used to directly visualize acute infarcts. However, it has several pitfalls, including the necessity to differentiate signal from slowly flowing blood in the ventricle, from increased signal from a region of infarction and artifactual variation of signal intensity in the myocardium due to respiratory motion or residual cardiac motion.\r"

Twenty-one patients (60%) developed recurrent carcinoma within 12 months and one patient (3%) within 14 months. Thirteen patients were clinically asymptomatic when recurrence was detected radiologically. Recurrence was initially confined to the mediastinum in one-half of the patients, whereas the others already had distant metastases when recurrence first became evident. Because most of the recurrent lesions originated outside the interposed stomach, CT was more useful than barium studies in showing early recurrence. Radiologic follow-up including CT allows earlier detection of limited recurrent carcinoma after surgery and, thus, offers the possibility of appropriate additional palliative radiotherapy or chemotherapy.\r"

These diagnoses were confirmed by hysterosalpingography with laparoscopy (five cases), dilation and curettage with laparoscopy (one case), or cesarean section (two cases). In six of the eight cases, MR correctly identified and accurately classified the type of anomaly. In the other two cases, the MR diagnosis was a bicornuate uterus with septation.

Aspiration of clear fluid (usually an indicator of benignity) with positive or negative cytology, occurred in 19 cystic renal malignancies.

  ".W": "MR imaging was performed through the carpal tunnel in 18 wrists of nine normal volunteers and compared with cryomicrotome sections from cadaver wrists. MR reliably imaged the flexor retinaculum and carpal bones and thus defined the borders of the carpal tunnel. In all cases the median nerve was seen as an ovoid structure of moderate signal intensity and was easily distinguished from the flexor tendons of the hands running in the carpal tunnel. The tendons were separated from each other by their tendon sheaths, and this allowed for identification of the various tendons. Anatomic variations encountered in the normal volunteers included anomalous positioning of the origin of the lumbrical muscles within the carpal tunnel in two, persistent median arteries in two, and interposition of the median nerve between the flexor pollicis longus and the superficial flexor tendon to the index finger in one. Preliminary observations in 10 wrists of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome include segmental and diffuse swelling of the median nerve in six, distortion of the nerve in one, and thickening of the tendon sheaths in one. We conclude that MR imaging accurately and reliably displays the normal anatomy of the carpal tunnel and can detect morphologic changes in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty patients with biopsy-proven osteogenic (11 cases) or Ewing's (nine cases) sarcoma were evaluated by MR imaging on a 0.15-T resistive unit to determine the value of MR in the diagnosis and treatment of these two neoplasms and to develop the best protocol for MR imaging. In all 20 cases, MR identified tumor spread into bone marrow, and it was superior to CT in five cases. Extension of tumor into the soft tissues adjacent to bone was shown better by MR than CT in six cases. Improved anatomic information from MR is the result of the ability to image in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Compared with CT, MR identifies cortical disease but has inferior spatial resolution and defines calcium poorly. MR can be used to monitor tumor response to chemotherapy, and the relationship of tumor to adjacent vasculature can be determined without the use of contrast agents. Two pulse sequences are necessary for maximum display of disease, since, in general, tumor involvement of the bone marrow is best assessed on T1-weighted sequences, and tumor involvement of the soft tissue is best seen on T2-weighted sequences. Additional information about bone-marrow involvement, soft-tissue tumor extent, and the relationship of tumor to blood vessels makes MR a valuable adjunct to CT in the evaluation of these neoplasms.\r"

Twenty-six patients with proven parosteal osteosarcoma were seen at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston. All were examined by conventional radiography, 16 by CT, and one by both CT and MR. CT is valuable for the evaluation of tumor invasion of the medullary canal, involvement of the cortex, and extension into the soft tissues, findings frequently not demonstrable by other noninvasive techniques. Additional information is obtained regarding the presence and location of satellite lesions and intralesional radiolucent areas and the relationship of the vascular bundle to the tumor mass. These findings are important for planning both percutaneous biopsy and surgery.\r"

It is, however, crucial to make an early and accurate diagnosis of thoracolumbar facet dislocation since the injury may be unstable and require reduction and internal fixation. This paper presents three major CT patterns of thoracolumbar facet fracture dislocation. The first represents anterior subluxation of the vertebral body with anteriorly locked facets. The second is a lateral vertebral body subluxation with laterally locked facets. The third is an acute kyphosis with little vertebral body subluxation but superiorly dislocated facets. Since the vertebral body subluxation may be missed on axial CT images, these facet-dislocation patterns should be recognized by identifying the paired superior and inferior facets and establishing their congruency. Identification of the facets is accomplished by their orientation with respect to the vertebral body (superior facets are directed posteromedially and inferior facets are directed anterolaterally) as well as by the shape of the articular surface (superior facet articular surface is concave, inferior facet articular surface is flat or convex).\r"

Endoscopy, which allows detailed examination of the upper airway, is an invasive procedure requiring sedation or anesthesia. A prospective study was undertaken to show the value of cine-CT (Imatron) scanning in diagnosing airway lesions in children. Eleven patients, aged 10 days to 4 years old, with a history of stridor were evaluated by both cine-CT and flexible fiberoptic endoscopy. Cine-CT studies of 12 children imaged for other reasons and without clinical evidence of airway disease served as controls to assess normal airway motion. Endoscopy identified 13 abnormalities, 11 of which were identified by cine-CT. Cine-CT has the capacity to image common causes of chronic stridor in children. It is rapid, noninvasive, and requires no sedation in most children. Although additional work is needed to clarify the role of cine-CT, this study suggests that cine-CT is a sensitive and specific imaging technique for evaluation of chronic stridor in infants and children.\r"

Fourteen patients had other diseases that might predispose them to abnormal esophageal motility and gastroesophageal reflux. Twenty-five patients had single-contrast and seven patients had double-contrast examinations. Four patients had normal single-contrast studies; 24 had gastroesophageal reflux; 12 had strictures; 10 had esophageal ulcers; and only four had hiatal hernias. The most notable difference between the results of endoscopy and the upper-gastrointestinal studies was the rate of detection of esophageal ulcers. Ten of the patients with single-contrast studies had ulcers seen at endoscopy but not shown radiologically. No specific radiologic signs of Barrett's esophagus were found, although most of our patients had abnormal upper gastrointestinal studies.\r"

However, the risk of PTD in these patients has not been determined. Therefore, we reviewed the records of 95 consecutive PTD patients, 30 (32%) of whom had cholangitis. Forty-four (46%) of the 95 patients underwent PTD as a preoperative measure; the remaining 51 (54%) had PTD for palliation of end-stage malignancies. Thirty-day mortality and overall morbidity were 17% and 30%, respectively, in the patients with cholangitis and 15% and 28% in the patients without cholangitis. These differences were not statistically significant. However, patients with cholangitis had a significantly higher (p less than .05) incidence of post-PTD bacteremia. In patients undergoing PTD for palliation, both mortality (25%, p less than .01) and morbidity (35%) were higher than in those being drained preoperatively. This analysis suggests that PTD can be performed safely in patients with cholangitis and that the patient's underlying disease process is more important than the presence of cholangitis in determining the outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-eight patients with spinal cord cavities were studied with MR imaging. Patients were separated into four groups, and the appearance of the cavities were compared. There were 24 patients (41.4%) with communicating syringomyelia (associated with the Chiari I malformation). Sixteen patients (27.6%) had posttraumatic syringomyelia, nine patients (15.5%) had associated tumors, and nine patients (15.5%) had idiopathic syringomyelia. The characteristics of each syrinx, the spinal cord, and the appearance of the cerebellar tonsils were analyzed on T2- and T1-weighted images. There is a striking similarity in the appearance of many syrinx cavities regardless of the cause. Characteristics that were found in some patients in every group included areas of increased intensity on T2-weighted images, the presence of the CSF flow-void sign (CFVS) in the syrinx cavity, eccentric cavities, \"beaded\" cavities, and cord enlargement. Tonsillar ectopia alone does not indicate that a syrinx is of the \"communicating\" type, since it was present in two of 16 patients (13%) with trauma and in two of five patients (40%) with tumors. T1-weighted images were most useful in evaluating the anatomic characteristics of the syrinx and the cerebellar tonsils. Most syrinx cavities involved the cervicothoracic junction. The average length was between five and nine vertebral segments (depending on category) but varied between one and 20 vertebral segments. T2-weighted images revealed areas of increased intensity in the spinal cord in 13 patients without tumors. Two of these cases were shown to represent gliosis on histopathologic review. The CFVS was present in the syrinx cavities of 23 patients (40%), probably reflecting pulsatile movements of the syrinx fluid. It has been proposed that such movements are a cause of syrinx propagation, and the observation of the CFVS may have prognostic significance. The development and progression of the CFVS was documented in serial MR examinations in one patient over an 18-month period. The theories of syrinx development and propagation are reviewed.\r"

Of eight patients with nine vessels demonstrating internal carotid artery dissection on arteriography, pseudoaneurysms were found in five arteries. Four of the five pseudoaneurysms occurred in tortuous (coiled) arterial segments. Thin-section contrast-enhanced dynamic incremental CT showed close agreement with the findings on selective arteriography and provided additional information on the presence and configuration of arterial wall thickening as well as the extent of the pseudoaneurysm. Our experience indicates that CT may play an important role in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of this lesion.\r"

Magnetite albumin microspheres (MAM) target almost exclusively to the reticuloendothelial system after IV administration, are stable in vitro and in vivo, and possess a long shelf life. The agent has a large magnetic susceptibility effect that selectively reduces T2 with little effect on T1. Biodistribution studies that use a dose of 20 mg MAM/kg show prompt clearance from the blood pool with marked decrease in T2 for rat liver (40%) and spleen (45%) with a small decrease in liver (5%) and spleen (10%) T1 values. Pulmonary T1 and T2 decrease transiently over the first 24 hr, while no significant changes were observed in other tissues. Imaging of a rabbit VX2 tumor model resulted in a 200% increase in the contrast ratio of VX2 tumor to normal liver on T2-weighted and mixed T1-/T2-weighted pulse sequences after administration of contrast agent. The extreme potency, excellent targeting, and apparent lack of toxicity of this agent suggest that MAM probably will have a clinical application in detecting focal hepatic and splenic lesions.\r"

  ".U": "87096915\r", 
  ".W": "The earliest described phase-modulation techniques for flow quantification by MR imaging require a phase image obtained by modifying one of the imaging gradients and a reference phase image obtained without the modified gradient. However, by using the same gradients that are used for routine two-dimensional Fourier transform imaging, both anatomic and velocity-encoded images can be obtained in one scan. Although convenient, this technique is sensitive to flow both within and perpendicular to the imaging plane. Consequently, significant errors occur in the measurement of flow in vessels oblique to the image plane. To determine the relative accuracy and practicality of quantitatively measuring flow in oblique vessels, we used standard sequence gradients with routine orthogonal plane imaging and direct compound oblique plane imaging. Phantom studies of flow in a vessel aligned along the z axis showed a significant linear correlation (r = .999; p less than .05) between the spin phase and spin velocity. However, studies of flow at relatively low physiologic rates (12-17 cm/sec) in vessels angled 0-30 degrees off axis showed that obliquities of as little as 10 degrees result in significant quantification errors. This is due to a larger phase shift per unit velocity along the frequency-encoding direction vs along the slice-select direction and to a mixture of velocities within a voxel that is oblique to the flow direction. In most instances, resolution of these errors can be achieved satisfactorily only by electronic plane rotation with compound oblique angulation so that the image plane and vessel are perpendicular. When so used, this technique potentially might provide important adjunctive quantitative flow data in oblique vessels during routine clinical imaging.\r"

The flow in either the superior mesenteric vein or the inferior vena cava was measured first at laparotomy (in ml/min) with electromagnetic flow meters. Immediately thereafter, these vessels were imaged by MR in 25-mm thick sections by using a standard spin echo (SE) 750/30 sequence with a Philips 0.5-T imager. Previous phase-flow calibration of the imager and sequence allowed calculation of the blood flow rates from the phase images that were used to measure the vessels' cross-sectional areas and blood phase values. Comparison of the measurements obtained with each technique showed a significant correlation (r = .977, p less than .05) between MR-imaging values and flow-meter measurements when the blood velocity was less than approximately 40 cm/sec, the known upper limit of the flow dynamic range for the MR hardware and sequence used. There was no correlation for blood velocities greater than 40 cm/sec. However, the range of blood flow velocities in dogs and man extends to more than 100 cm/sec. Thus, these results suggest that this technique might yield valuable adjunctive flow data in routine clinical imaging provided that improvements in hardware and software permit a larger dynamic range.\r"

Spleen cell suspensions were passed over nylon wool columns and then used as effector cells in a short-term natural killer cell cytotoxicity assay with 51Cr-labeled YAC-1 cells as target cells. The results showed no evidence of decreased cytotoxicity due to exposure to MR. On the contrary, at all three times after exposure and for all target-to-effector cell ratios, mean cytotoxicity was greater for MR-exposed groups than for sham-exposed groups.

  ".W": "The minimum spatial resolution required for a total digital radiology department has yet to be defined. A pilot study designed to provide this information was performed. Abnormal and normal radiographic images of children were digitized and redisplayed on film at spatial resolutions of 5.0, 2.5, 1.25, and 0.625 lp/mm. These resolutions are comparable to a digital display of a 14 X 14 in. chest image having pixel elements of 4096 X 4096, 2048 X 2048, 1024 X 1024, and 512 X 512, respectively. Contrast resolution was maintained at 12 bits or 4096 gray levels. The three phases of data acquisition were (1) the standard analysis of receiver operating characteristics, (2) a checklist evaluation of the \"seeability\" of important structures, and (3) a comparison of all resolutions and a discernment of usability. Fifteen radiologists participated in the study. On the basis of the pediatric cases used, the results showed that the needed spatial resolution for a total digital radiology department may be around 2.5 lp/mm (2048 X 2048). Checklist data on seeability of structures and comparisons of all resolutions give information on specific changes that are occurring as the resolution is decreased, and, when included with the receiver-operating-characteristic data, they become a major component in developing a resolution standard. The finding that 2.5 lp/mm is the required spatial resolution makes construction of a total digital radiology department possible with present state-of-the-art technology.\r"

The term parafollicular B-lymphocytes (PBLs) is recommended herein to emphasize their morphologic and immunologic features. An unusual feature of this PBL lymphoma is the numerous benign-appearing hyperplastic follicles surrounded by the neoplastic infiltrate, mimicking the cytologic appearance and distribution of PBLs seen in toxoplasmic lymphadenitis. The function of these recently recognized B-cells is unknown; their anatomic relationship with hyperplastic follicular centers in reactive states and the lymphoma herein described suggests a role in follicular function.\r"

Diminished levels of at least one serum immunoglobulin were present in 77% of all patients with CLL and 73% of patients with Stage 0 disease. The mean concentration of IgG, IgM, and IgA decreased with advancing stage of CLL. The percentages of total T, T-helper (TH), and T-suppressor (TS) cells in the peripheral blood were less in patients with CLL than in healthy persons, but the absolute concentrations of total T, TH, and TS cells were greater in patients with CLL than controls (P less than 0.02). The absolute number of B-cells (P less than 0.01) and null cells (P less than 0.001) was also increased in patients with CLL, particularly those patients in advanced stages of CLL. These findings suggest that the hypogammaglobulinemia associated with CLL first occurs during the earliest stage of disease and may be related to the alterations in the proportion of peripheral blood lymphocytes.\r"

A total of 412 urines were analyzed with the Ames and Bio-Dynamics reagent strips. The sensitivity and specificity of Leukostix results, relative to a quantitative chamber count, were 89.4% and 90.4%, respectively. Chemstrip LN provided essentially the same results with a sensitivity of 88.8% and specificity of 92.4%. The between-reader and between-lot reproducibility was excellent, with 99% of the results agreeing within half a color block of each other. The sensitivity of the sediment count relative to the chamber count was 68.9% and the specificity, 97.7%. Performance of the sediment count in addition to use of the reagent strip provided little additional information.

Three-locus analyses yielded best support for the order MET-CF-D7S8, with odds against the alternate orders CF-MET-D7S8 and CF-D7S8-MET of 9:1 and 161:1, respectively. However, the number of observed recombinants was small and only one of the recombinants was jointly informative for all three markers.

The pedigrees are multigenerational and together consist of more than 300 members including 30 affected individuals, while the nuclear families each have two generations and either two or three children with CF. Tight linkage was observed between the CF locus and the met oncogene locus theta = 0, zeta = 15.45), pJ3.11 (theta = 0, zeta = 10.07), and 7C22 (theta = 0, zeta = 6.64) in both the pedigrees and nuclear families with no evidence for recombination between CF and any of the DNA markers. Weaker linkage between the CF locus and the locus for the serum enzyme activity marker paraoxonase (PON) was detected, theta = 0.18, zeta = 0.76. The two pedigrees were sufficiently informative to detect significant linkage between CF and each of the three DNA markers previously shown to be tightly linked to the CF locus. These results establish a locus for CF in these pedigrees in the region of chromosome 7 nearest the three DNA markers met, pJ3.11, and 7C22 and are consistent with locus homogeneity for the defect causing CF in these populations and others that have been examined to date.\r"

DR beta hybridizations with TaqI-digested DNA did not detect any new DR specificities in the Pacific. However, within the DR5 specificity a common DNA subtype was found in Pacific Islanders that was not seen in Caucasoids. Altogether, four DNA subtypes of DR5 are described. With the DQ alpha and DQ beta probes, significantly more variation could be demonstrated between populations. For example, DR2 was associated with a DQ beta TaqI pattern in the Pacific that was very rare in Caucasoids and additional RFLP analysis with other enzymes showed that this pattern is probably associated with the Dw12 subtype of DR2. DRw8-positive samples showed two different DQ alpha TaqI patterns, and these correlated with DQw1 and DQw3 specificities. DR alpha hybridizations with BglII-digested DNA also revealed different linkage relationships of the HLA-class II region genes between Pacific and Caucasoid specimens. The different population linkage disequilibrium relationships have permitted tentative assignment of TaqI fragments to either the DR beta 1 or DR beta 2 genes and are highly suggestive that the DQw1 specificity is encoded by the DQ alpha chain gene. This study shows the value of population comparisons in contributing to knowledge of the genetic organization of the genome.\r"

Northern blot analyses demonstrated the presence of three poly (A)+ mRNAs of about 5,600, 2,500, and 2,000 nucleotides in length from all cell extracts. All three mRNAs were present in normal amounts in fibroblast extracts from several subtypes and variants of Gaucher disease. The largest poly (A)+ mRNA species was thought to represent an unspliced nuclear precursor for the two smaller beta-Glc mRNAs. S1 nuclease analyses, using SP6 transcripts of beta-Glc cDNA, indicated that the 2,000 nucleotide mRNA differs from the 2,500 nucleotide form at both the 5' and 3' ends. These results are consistent with the use of an alternate 5' splice site and 3' polyadenylation signal. These results also suggest that the subtype and variants of Gaucher disease result from single base alterations that lead to the synthesis of defective beta-Glc.\r"

The statistical information, however, contains gross violations of epidemiologic principles and scientific standards for credible evidence. The calculations often depend on an improper linkage of numerators and denominators; and the calculated rates, assembled from reports of overtly detected cases of cancer, represent neither incidence nor prevalence. Many of the secular or regional changes in rates are due to corresponding changes in the availability and dissemination of diagnostic technology, but the technologic changes have not been adequately evaluated or investigated. Improvements will require drastically altered approaches to the use of death certificates, tumor registries, and clues from necropsy data.\r"

  ".W": "The study of monoclonal gammopathies in the elderly provides an opportunity to define immunologic and neoplastic changes with aging. Previous reports using paper and cellulose acetate electrophoresis have documented an age-related increase in monoclonal gammopathies. In this study, the more sensitive techniques of high-resolution agarose gel electrophoresis and immunofixation were used, in conjunction with other protein studies, to further evaluate the prevalence of monoclonal gammopathies in 111 ambulatory residents (aged 62 to 95) of a retirement home. Eleven of the 111 residents (10 percent) were found to have a monoclonal gammopathy, ranging in concentration from 0.2 to 1.8 g/dl. All monoclonal gammopathies were confirmed by immunofixation, which also documented the presence of additional unsuspected monoclonal components in three of the 11 residents. The prevalence of monoclonal gammopathies by age ranged from 6 percent in the group younger than 80 years of age to 14 percent in the group older than 90 years of age. Only one of the 11 residents had any clinical or routine laboratory suggestion of a monoclonal gammopathy. The other 10 had normal ratios of total protein and albumin to globulin. Five of the 11 (45 percent) had an otherwise clinically unexplained erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 20 mm/hour, compared with only two of 100 in the group without monoclonal gammopathies. Follow-up studies one to three years after initial evaluation revealed that five of the 11 patients had died, two with evidence of disease progression. In the other six patients, monoclonal protein concentration and other protein values remained stable. An unexplained elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the elderly warrants investigation for the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy. Agarose gel electrophoresis and immunofixation identify a higher percent of monoclonal gammopathies in the elderly than has previously been recognized. Identification of monoclonal components in this population is useful for the subsequent study of plasma cell dyscrasias, neoplastic disease, or other immune dysfunction in the aged.\r"

Underlying diseases included leukemia in 15 patients, lymphoma in nine, nonhematologic malignancies in five, acquired immune deficiency syndrome in two, an various inflammatory diseases treated by corticosteroids in 16 patients. Cytotoxic drugs with corticosteroids were used in 68 percent of patients, whereas 23 percent received corticosteroids alone. Clinical features consisted of progressive dyspnea (74 percent), cough (55 percent), and fever (62 percent), with normal findings on examination (43 percent), or crackles (53 percent). Arterial oxygen tension and oxygen saturation were 48.6 +/- 12.8 mm Hg and 81.2 +/- 6.5 percent, respectively. Chest roentgenographs exhibited diffuse alveolar and interstitial infiltrates with predominantly perihilar distribution. The diagnostic rates for open lung biopsy and bronchoscopy were 97 percent and 62 percent, respectively. Clinical improvement and survival following appropriate therapy were noted in 22 patients (41.5 percent), whereas the remaining 31 patients died within four weeks of hospitalization. When survivors were compared with nonsurvivors, there was no difference in mean age, leukocyte counts, arterial oxygen tension, or duration of symptoms before treatment. A coexisting pulmonary infection was identified more frequently in nonsurvivors (51.6 percent) than in survivors (22.7 percent, p = 0.01). The mortality from P. carinii pneumonia alone was 47 percent, whereas 76 percent of those with coexisting infection died. Despite antibiotic therapy and potentially effective chemoprophylaxis, P. carinii pneumonia remains a significant and life-threatening complication of diseases or treatments associated with immune suppression.\r"

Epidermal growth factor replacement therapy given to these mice during pregnancy improved the outcome of complete pregnancy to 86%. The administration of anti-epidermal growth factor antiserum in a daily dose of 50 or 100 microliter to sialoadenectomized pregnant mice increased the percentages of abortion to 67 and 100, respectively.

If tonometers were kept moist the virus could be detected more than eight hours later. Several ophthalmic solutions, including topical anesthetics, dilating agents, and a fluorescein solution, showed only minimal antiviral activities. Wiping of virus-infected tonometer heads with a dry tissue was ineffective and allowed residual infectious virus to remain. However, no infectious virus could be detected on infected tonometer heads that had been swabbed with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Our results raised concerns regarding effective disinfection of tonometers after eye examinations. We concluded that the applanation tonometer should be swabbed routinely with alcohol after each patient examination to ensure complete virus inactivation and to prevent accidental transmission of virus in the clinical setting.\r"

Some data suggest that gastric ulceration caused by stressful stimuli is due to diminished mucosal synthesis of prostaglandins. To examine this hypothesis, we determined the effect of hemorrhage, an ulcerogenic stimulus, on ex vivo production of immunoreactive prostaglandin E2 by gastric tissue in the rat. Macroscopic gastric ulcers were reproducibly observed in Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to hemorrhage (3 ml/100 g body weight). The number of ulcers was linearly related to the duration of shock. Prostaglandin E2 synthesis was significantly increased during in vitro incubation of oxyntic and nonoxyntic stomach tissue excised from rats subjected to hemorrhage for 30 minutes (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that damage to the gastric mucosa in rats subjected to hemorrhage occurs despite augmented endogenous secretion of prostaglandin E2. Mechanisms other than impaired prostaglandin biosynthesis were probably responsible for mucosal injury in this model.\r"

Anesthesia was induced in all patients with propofol, 2 mg/kg. Subsequently, patients were randomly assigned to two groups and maintained by a continuous intravenous infusion (group 1 received 54 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1, group 2 received 108 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) to supplement 67% nitrous oxide. Three minutes after induction, systolic arterial pressure (SAP) decreased 28% (P less than 0.01) and was associated with decreased (-12%) cardiac output (Q70) and decreased (-15%) systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation was not obtunded, but peak values of arterial pressures and heart rate did not exceed those recorded awake. Thirty minutes elapsed before repeating measurements prior to the first surgical incision. In group 1, SAP and Q70 decreased to 65% and 68% of awake values and in group 2 to 55% and 74% (P less than 0.05). Mild ventilatory depression persisted for the duration of spontaneous ventilation and was not reduced by the stimulus of surgery, which caused no significant hemodynamic responses in either group. Decreasing arterial PCO2 to the awake value by controlled ventilation increased SVR (P less than 0.05), but the associated increased SAP and decreased Q70 did not reach statistical significance. No patient reported awareness. The infusion of the emulsion formulation of propofol was associated with satisfactory anesthesia and recovery and with hemodynamic effects similar to those recorded with other intravenous anesthetics.\r"

Optical isomers, also called enantiomers, are pairs of compounds with the same molecular formula and functional groups, but which differ in the arrangement of the groups around an \"asymmetric\" carbon atom and in the direction they rotate plane-polarized light. By definition, enantiomers that are anesthetics can distinguish between stereoselective and nonselective sites of anesthetic action. We used such enantiomers to determine whether anesthetics are stereoselective in their actions on animals by measuring the potencies of a homologous series of secondary aliphatic alcohols from 2-butanol through 2-octanol in tadpoles, using reversible loss of righting reflex as the endpoint. None of the isomeric pairs exhibited significant differences in potency. Anesthetic potency increased logarithmically with the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chain of the alcohol. The ED50 +/- SE (mM) for the (+) and (-) forms of the alcohols, respectively, were as follows: 2-butanol 17 +/- 1.2, 17 +/- 1.1; 2-pentanol 4.7 +/- 0.28, 4.8 +/- 0.27; 2-hexanol 1.33 +/- 0.068, 1.42 +/- 0.079; 2-heptanol 0.32 +/- 0.011, 0.33 +/- 0.020; and 2-octanol 0.063 +/- 0.0042, 0.061 +/- 0.0032. These data demonstrate a lack of stereoselectivity in the interactions between the anesthetic secondary alcohols and their site of action in animals.\r"

The original diagnosis was sarcoidosis, but 4 of the workers were subsequently proved to have hypersensitivity to beryllium by in vitro proliferative responses of lymphocytes obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage. Review of medical records of coworkers and extensive industrial hygiene surveillance of the plant demonstrated that 4 cases occurred in the furnace area where air concentrations of beryllium fume were consistently below the permissible exposure limit of 2 micrograms/M3. A single case has been recognized from parts of the refinery where exposures to cold beryllium dust often exceeded the standard by as much as 20-fold. These data demonstrate that chronic beryllium disease still occurs and confirm the importance of specific immunologic testing in patients suspected of having sarcoidosis but with potential exposure to beryllium. The data raise concern about the adequacy of modern industrial controls, especially in the setting of exposure to highly respirable beryllium fume.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we attempted to establish the prevalence and nature of pulmonary dysfunction in a cross section of a diabetic population and the relationship of pulmonary dysfunction to diabetic factors and complications. Forty insulin-dependent diabetic patients, 15 to 60 yr of age, and 40 healthy reference subjects, matched for age, sex, and race, were studied. All subjects were lifelong nonsmokers and had no clinical evidence of past or present respiratory disease. Lung function was assessed from the flow-volume curve, single-breath nitrogen washout, static lung elastic recoil, and pulmonary diffusing capacity (DLCO/VA) and its components: membrane diffusing capacity (Dm/VA) and pulmonary capillary blood volume (Qc/VA). The diabetic patients had an increased value for Kst(L) and in Kst(L), the exponential shape constant of the pressure-volume curve compared with that of the reference subjects (Kst(L), 0.184 +/- 0.011 versus 0.135 +/- 0.005; p less than 0.005, mean +/- SEM). The DL/VA was lower in the diabetic subjects (4.62 = 0.12 versus 5.31 +/- 0.10 ml/min/mm Hg/L; p less than 0.001), and this was due to a lower Qc/VA (9.45 +/- 0.43 versus 11.75 +/- 0.35 ml/min; p less than 0.001). The Kst(L) and Qc/VA were correlated with the duration of diabetes. The In Kst(L) was negatively correlated with both DL/VA (r = -0.32, p less than 0.05) and Qc/VA (r = -0.36, p less than 0.05). There was no association between abnormal pulmonary function and the presence of other diabetic complications. It is concluded that there are mild, duration-related abnormalities of lung elastic recoil and pulmonary diffusing capacity and a reduction in pulmonary capillary blood volume in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

Few data are currently available on the in vivo distribution of these homogeneous, functional cell populations. Such information is important to understanding the mechanisms by which T-lymphocytes exert their effector activity. We examined 2 cloned populations of influenza virus-specific T-lymphocytes. One clone was a Lyt-2+, L3T4-, class I MHC-restricted, cytolytic T-lymphocyte subset. The other clone was a Lyt-2-, L3T4+, Class II MHC-restricted clone of the helper/amplifier T-cell subset. Both clones promote recovery from lethal pulmonary influenza infection upon adoptive transfer. Using cell populations labeled with [3H]thymidine, we examined the distribution of these cells in tissue sections from various organs. These cloned cell populations were preferentially retained in the lungs of uninfected and influenza-virus-infected animals. This retention is independent of the cell's viral antigenic specificity, but may be dependent on the phenotype of the clone. Once retained in the lungs, these cells migrated across the bronchial lamina propria and entered the epithelium and pulmonary lumen. The significance of these observations for in vivo T-lymphocyte functions is discussed.\r"

In these studies, we demonstrated that natural interleukin-1 (IL-1), as well as recombinant IL-1 beta, a polypeptide released from stimulated macrophages, is a potent chemotactic factor that is relatively specific for helper T-cells. This chemotactic activity is blocked by a species-specific anti-IL-1. Compared with its capacity to augment proliferation of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated murine thymocytes, IL-1 is more active as a chemotactic factor for mature T-cells. These studies suggest that stimulated lung macrophages, as well as other macrophages, may enhance their interaction with circulating T-lymphocytes via IL-1, which acts as both a chemoattractant and an initiator of T-lymphocyte activation.\r"

  ".U": "87098242\r", 
  ".W": "It has been suggested that human alveolar macrophages have a limited capacity to release interleukin-1 (IL-1). To determine whether this apparent defect in cell function is related to the release of factors that inhibit the response of lymphocytes to IL-1, we evaluated the capacity of human alveolar macrophages to release prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a factor that is known to suppress the response of lymphocytes to IL-1. The amount of PGE2 released by alveolar macrophages was dependent on the amount of LPS present in the cultures and the amount of time the cells were present in culture. After 24 h in culture, the alveolar macrophage supernatants contained sufficient amounts of PGE2 to significantly suppress PHA-induced lymphocyte proliferation (p less than 0.01), IL-1-induced thymocyte proliferation (p less than 0.001), but not IL-2-induced lymphocyte proliferation (p greater than 0.2). Consistent with these observations, only small amounts of IL-1 activity could be detected in 24-h supernatants of LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages using thymocyte proliferation as an assay for IL-1. Using a more sensitive assay for IL-1, however, it was demonstrated that the supernatants of LPS-stimulated macrophages contained amounts of IL-1 that were not significantly different from those present in supernatants of LPS-stimulated monocytes. Indomethacin (1 microgram/ml) completely suppressed the release of PGE2 by alveolar macrophages. These observations suggest that the apparent defect in the release of IL-1 by human alveolar macrophages may be due in part to the release of large amounts of PGE2, which suppresses various lymphocyte functions.\r"

Over 3.5 years in 173 patients, 362 exacerbations were treated, 180 with placebo and 182 with antibiotic. The success rate with placebo was 55% and with antibiotic 68%. The rate of failure with deterioration was 19% with placebo and 10% with antibiotic. There was a significant benefit associated with antibiotic. Peak flow recovered more rapidly with antibiotic treatment than with placebo. Side effects were uncommon and did not differ between antibiotic and placebo.\r"

These two isolates from the Tufts Anaerobe Laboratory (TAL) were resistant to all other beta-lactam agents tested. The organisms were able to inactivate imipenem in broth cultures and contained similar beta-lactamases that were able to hydrolyze carbapenems, cephamycins, cephalosporins, and penicillins. The molecular sizes of the beta-lactamases in TAL2480 and TAL3636 were estimated to be 44,000 daltons. The novel beta-lactamase contained Zn2+ as a cofactor. An additional factor contributing to resistance was determined. The outer membranes of these two organisms were found to limit free diffusion of the drugs into the periplasm. This novel beta-lactamase, associated with a barrier to drug permeation, resulted in high-grade beta-lactam drug resistance.\r"

Three mutants highly resistant to nearly all beta-lactam antibiotics were stably derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Although no other changes could be detected, virulence in a mouse septicemia model was decreased in two of these mutants. One mutant, 908-Ssi, showed selectively decreased susceptibility to ampicillin and cefotetan. A change in beta-lactamase expression was thought to be responsible for this. Alterations in the production of two outer membrane proteins with molecular sizes of 36.5 and 39 kilodaltons were responsible for multiple antibiotic resistance in two mutants, both of which acquired a low level of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Whereas one of the mutants, AMA-R, simultaneously acquired resistance to chloramphenicol and trimethoprim, the other, AZT-R, became hypersusceptible to these and other hydrophobic agents. Both strains had drastically reduced virulence in mice.\r"

The compound had a very low affinity for cephalosporinases from Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus vulgaris. Cefpirome showed strong antimicrobial activity against eight beta-lactamase (cephalosporinase)-producing strains which have become resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins; especially against E. cloacae and C. freundii, it had the highest activity among the cephalosporins used. Its activity against ampicillin-resistant R plasmid-containing transconjugant isolates of Escherichia coli was as high as that against the recipient strain E. coli chi 1037. The inducer activity of cefpirome in S. marcescens and P. vulgaris increased dose dependently, whereas cephamycin derivatives showed high inducer activity at low concentrations. A relatively low affinity of cefpirome for beta-lactamases is considered to be one of the reasons for its high antimicrobial activity against such enzyme-producing strains. In addition, other factors such as good penetration through the outer membrane and affinity for the target sites may also be involved in the high activity of cefpirome.\r"

The results led to the definition of a minimal extracellular concentration inhibiting intracellular multiplication (MIEC). According to the MIECs, the antimicrobial agents tested were classified in three groups: very active (MIEC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml), such as erythromycin, rifampin, and pefloxacin; active (1 microgram/ml greater than or equal to MIEC greater than or equal to 0.1 microgram/ml), such as sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim or doxycycline; and ineffective, such as cefoxitin, which was not active within macrophages at as high as 64 micrograms/ml despite a low MIC (0.2 microgram/ml) on bacterial charcoal-yeast extract agar. The activity of netilmicin was difficult to assess because of its effect on extracellular legionellae. Combinations of erythromycin with rifampin and pefloxacin with erythromycin, rifampin, doxycycline, or netilmicin showed an additive effect and no antagonism. These results obtained in a cellular model are in agreement with the efficacy of antimicrobial agents in experimental infections and in Legionnaires disease. They sustain clinical interest in the new quinolones, such as pefloxacin, and in combinations of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of Legionnaires disease.\r"

We investigated the beta-lactamase activity of crude extracts obtained from three strains of Bacteroides bivius and two strains of Bacteroides fragilis against cefoxitin and moxalactam. In a spectrophotometric antibiotic assay with a 24-h incubation period, B. bivius extracts decreased the initial concentration (10 micrograms/ml) of moxalactam and cefoxitin by 60%, whereas B. fragilis extracts had no effect. In a microbiological assay, when B. bivius or B. fragilis extracts were added to cephalothin (10 micrograms/ml) or cefamandole (4 micrograms/ml), we observed complete disappearance of the inhibitory zones against the indicator strain (Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124). Only the B. bivius extracts were able to decrease the inhibitory activity (from 10 to 100%) of cefoxitin and moxalactam (each at 10 micrograms/ml). Prior addition of clavulanic acid to crude extracts prevented the losses of antibacterial activity. Furthermore, the inhibition of the beta-lactamase hydrolysis of nitrocefin by cefoxitin or moxalactam was prevented by a 12-h preincubation of the beta-lactam with the B. bivius extracts but not with the B. fragilis extracts. Finally, with the B. bivius strain producing the most beta-lactamase, we showed an effect of inoculum size on the MICs of cefoperazone, cefoxitin, and moxalactam with a broth dilution technique. Increasing the inoculum size with the B. fragilis strains had no effect on the MISs of cefoxitin and moxalactam. These results indicate a slow and clavulanate-sensitive beta-lactamase activity of B. bivius extracts against cefoxitin and moxalactam.\r"

Baseline data were collected for one year in the initial phase of the study. Only one prescription (1.4%) in the initial phase (0.96% of the total) met the criteria for appropriate use. However, during the year after an educational intervention by a clinical pharmacist explaining the proper use of oral cephalosporins, the prescribing of these agents decreased substantially. Educational strategies in medical schools and residency programs that seek to improve drug-prescribing behavior should combine drug utilization review programs with specific education about the appropriate use of pharmacologic agents.\r"

Comparing 47,136 exposed patients to 44,634 unexposed patients, the unadjusted relative risk for developing UGI bleeding 30 days after exposure to a NSAID was 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.0). Univariate analyses demonstrated associations between UGI bleeding and age, sex, state, alcohol-related diagnoses, preexisting abdominal conditions, and use of anticoagulants. This association between NSAIDs and UGI bleeding was unchanged after adjusting for these potential confounding variables using logistic regression. A linear dose-response relationship and a quadratic duration-response relationship were demonstrated. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with UGI bleeding, although the magnitude of the increased risk is reassuringly small.\r"

Syngeneic transfusions did not alter macrophage migration or arachidonic acid metabolism.

The response of PBMCs to pokeweed mitogen was stimulated twofold by 50 microM H2O2, but 200 microM H2O2 inhibited the pokeweed mitogen response by more than 95%. A 50 microM concentration of H2O2 completely blocked the generation of cytotoxic T cells in the mixed lymphocyte culture but did not inhibit the production of interleukin 2. Concentrations of 100 microM to 200 microM H2O2 inhibited interleukin 2 production by 45% to 57%. The H2O2 appeared to block early events in T-cell activation, since 200 microM H2O2 was not inhibitory when added one hour after stimulating the cells with phytohemagglutinin. Treatment of PBMCs with 200 microM H2O2 did not decrease the total cellular thiol pool, suggesting that H2O2-mediated inhibition of the proliferative response was not due to thiol oxidation. However, pretreatment of PBMCs with the lipid antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, and n-propyl gallate blocked more than 75% of the inhibitory effect of H2O2, suggesting that H2O2 inhibits T-cell activation by inducing lipid peroxidation.\r"

Separation and reconstitution of autologous T and B cell-enriched fractions, with and without prior T cell irradiation, provided evidence for a radiosensitive T helper/inducer cell involved in the IgM-RF response to SAC in 70% of the normal subjects studied.

Lymphocytes from patients also showed higher IgM rheumatoid factor production after mitogen stimulation. Patients had competent suppressor activity for IgG, but not for IgM synthesis. Pre-irradiation of T cells, but not depletion of OKT8+ cells, markedly enhanced IgG synthesis in cocultures with autologous B cells; therefore, the T lymphocyte responsible for this effect is radiosensitive and is not identified by OKT8. OKT8+ lymphocytes from patients did not suppress Ig synthesis by autologous B plus T cell cocultures. However, OKT8+ cells from normal controls down-regulated Ig synthesis by B plus T cells from patients. The abnormal proportion of helper and suppressor cells suggests that there is altered redistribution of regulatory subpopulations in peripheral blood from Sjogren's syndrome patients.\r"

By statistical analysis, we showed that the B27 haplotype carried by the eldest member with AS in each family was more likely to be associated with disease. If additional genetic factors play a role in the development of AS, these preliminary findings suggest that they are probably located around the major histocompatibility complex.\r"

Our data indicate that macrophages recruited to the middle ear were functional phagocytes capable of discriminate phagocytosis and intracellular killing of eight species of bacteria associated with otitis media, as determined by a fluorochrome microassay. Streptococcus pneumoniae types 14 and 19F, which are associated with the highest relapse frequency in cases of acute otitis media, were the most resistant to phagocytosis. The two organisms most often involved in chronic otitis media (Staphylococcus epidermidis and nontypable Haemophilus influenzae), however, were among the most readily phagocytized isolates. The relative importance of macrophage function in defense of the middle ear, therefore, may be dependent on the causative agent.\r"

In extreme cases, sheets of T cells, including T helper lymphocytes, formed a syncytium with endothelial cells in the dermis. Marked capillary proliferation was noted both on light and electron microscopy. We suggest that erythroderma is precipitated by antigens such as protein A, a potent T cell mitogen present on the cell surface of Staphylococcus aureus, or by drugs, such as phenytoin. These antigens induce antigen presentation by individual endothelial cells, leading to T helper transformation and lymphocyte proliferation. Endothelial proliferation resulting from lymphocyte-endothelial interaction results in the vascular proliferation associated with this syndrome.\r"

A total of 1,218 of 1,281 possible children participated in the study. They were 11 to 14 years of age, and all attended secondary schools in two distinct small areas, 70 km apart, between which there is no social contact. A blood sample was taken from each subject for determination of the blood group and von Willebrand factor (vWf) level (measured as ristocetin cofactor and expressed in IU/dL after calibration of the internal pool against an international standard), and the parents were given a questionnaire concerning hemorrhagic symptoms in the members of the family in the last three generations. Separate normal ranges were calculated for blood group O and non-O subjects (1,166 children and 289 adults) with a nonparametric method because the distribution curves of the reference values did not fit the gaussian distribution. Diagnoses of vWd were considered only for children who had low vWf levels and were members of a family with a convincing bleeding history (case of \"probable vWd\"). A final diagnosis was assigned if, in addition to these criteria, at least one other family member on the side with hemorrhagic history had a low vWf level. Of the 1,218 children examined, ten were classified as having vWd (0.82%). Taking into account the 90% confidence interval for the lower limit of the normal range, this figure could range from 7 (0.57%) to 14 (1.15%). All these subjects were mildly to moderately affected and presented features of heterozygous classic vWd (type I). Affected subjects were distributed evenly in the two areas examined. Our results suggest that the prevalence of vWd might be much higher than previously reported and that a different screening approach might be of use for patients with mild bleeding diathesis.\r"

When low concentrations of aplastic canine sera (2.5% to 5.0% [vol/vol]) were added to cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in place of normal AB serum, megakaryocyte colony formation was augmented fivefold, cell numbers per colony increased approximately 2.5-fold, and the geometric mean megakaryocyte ploidy almost doubled.

However, there was a further augmentation of cell numbers per colony associated with a progressive decrease in the mean megakaryocyte ploidy. Megakaryocyte cultures were harvested after 7, 12, 15, and 19 days of incubation, and these demonstrated that the lower mean ploidy values found at the higher concentrations of aplastic canine serum did not result from delayed endoreduplication. At all aplastic serum concentrations evaluated, there existed a strong correlation between nuclear ploidy and cell diameter. We conclude that both the mitotic and endomitotic events in human megakaryocytopoiesis may be influenced by a factor or factors present in aplastic canine serum. At lower in vitro concentrations, such sera stimulate both mitosis and endomitosis, which promotes the development of megakaryocyte colonies composed of larger cells with a higher mean ploidy. With increasing aplastic serum concentrations, colony formation plateaus and mitosis is favored over endomitosis. This results in colonies composed of more numerous but smaller megakaryocytes with a lower mean ploidy. Our data suggest that the size and extent of polyploidization that can be achieved by a developing megakaryocyte may be influenced by the mitotic prior history of its immediate precursor cell.\r"

Dose-dependent levels of free serum 1F5 were detected in all patients. Two patients had circulating tumor cells and in both cases 90% of malignant cells were eliminated from the blood stream within four hours of initiation of serotherapy. Antigenic modulation did not occur, and sustained reduction of circulating tumor cells was observed throughout the duration of the infusions. Serial bone marrow aspirations and lymph node biopsies were examined by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence techniques to ascertain MoAb penetration into extravascular sites. High doses (100 to 800 mg/m2/d and high serum 1F5 levels (13 to 190 micrograms/mL) were required to coat tumor cells in these compartments in contrast to the low doses that were adequate for depletion of circulating cells. Clinical response appeared to correlate with dose of MoAb administered with progressive disease (52 mg), stable disease (104 mg), minor response (1,032 mg), and partial response (2,380 mg) observed in consecutive patients. The patient treated with the highest 1F5 dose achieved a 90% reduction in evaluable lymph node disease, but the duration of this remission was brief (six weeks). This study demonstrates that high doses of 1F5 can be administered to patients with negligible toxicity by continuous infusion and that clinical responses can be obtained in patients given greater than 1 g of unmodified antibody over a ten-day period.\r"

At shear stresses of 90 or 180 dyne/cm2 applied for 30 seconds or five minutes, aggregation was either absent or only transient and reversible using severe von Willebrand's disease (vWD) PRP (less than 1% von Willebrand factor, vWF); Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) PRP (platelets deficient in the membrane glycoprotein Ib, GPIb); normal PRP plus monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to GPIb; thrombasthenic PRP (platelets deficient in membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex, GPIIb-IIIa); and normal PRP plus MoAb to GPIIb-IIIa. Shear-induced aggregation was inhibited under the above conditions, even though the platelets were activated to release their granular contents. Sheared normal platelets in vWD plasma aggregated in response to added vWF. These studies demonstrate that the formation of stable platelet aggregates under conditions of high shear requires vWF and the availability of both GPIb and GPIIb-IIIa on platelet membranes. The experiments demonstrate that vWF-platelet interactions can occur in the absence of artificial agonists or chemical modification of vWF. They suggest a possible mechanism for platelet aggregation in stenosed or partially obstructed arterial vessels in which the platelets are subjected to relatively high levels of shear stress.\r"

An activated peptide release assay using 3H-factor IX as a substrate was used to evaluate inhibition. Increasing the tissue factor concentration from 20% to 40% (vol/vol) overcame the inhibitory mechanism in normal plasma but not in factor VII-deficient plasma supplemented with a low concentration of factor VII. A second wave of factor IX activation obtained by a second addition of tissue factor to plasma with a normal factor VII concentration was almost abolished by supplementing the reaction mixture with additional EPI and factor X. Factor Xa's active site was necessary for factor Xa's contribution to inhibition, but preliminary incubation of factor Xa with EPI in the absence of factor VIIa/tissue factor complex or of factor VIIa/tissue factor complex in the absence of EPI did not replace the need for the simultaneous presence of factor Xa, factor VIIa/tissue factor, calcium, and EPI in an inhibitory reaction mixture. Inhibition of factor VIIa/tissue factor was reversible; both tissue factor and factor VIIa activity could be recovered from a dissociated, inhibited factor VIIa/tissue factor complex. EPI appeared to bind to a factor VIIa/tissue factor complex formed in the presence of factor Xa but not to a factor VIIa/tissue factor complex formed in the absence of factor Xa.\r"

GY30 cells secrete two growth factor activities distinct from interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-2, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) but functionally similar to GM-CSF and G-CSF. The production of both CSFs is increased 70- to 200-fold by treating GY30 cells with lipopolysaccharide or IL-1. RNA blot analysis reveals the presence of GM-CSF and G-CSF transcripts and demonstrates that IL-1 regulates the production of both factors at the mRNA level. Further, these studies show that the GM-CSF secreted by GY30 cells is structurally similar to the GM-CSF produced by activated T cells.\r"

Lasting improvement in clinical symptoms was found in four patients during treatment and the remaining patients experienced a similar benefit within 2 months of irradiation. There was marked reduction in exacerbations and the number of joints involved. Morning stiffness, joint swelling and tenderness decreased. Complications included severe fatigue during treatment and acute bacterial arthritis in multiple joints in one patient. Four of the patients have since died, one of renal failure and another of cardiogenic shock following surgery 3 and 24 months after total lymphoid irradiation. Both had generalised amyloidosis. The third patient developed joint empyema and died of toxic cardiac failure. The fourth died 3 months after resection of a Kaposi's sarcoma complicated by wound infection which responded to treatment. Immunologically, total lymphoid irradiation resulted in suppression of the absolute lymphocyte count and a reduction in T-helper cells, while the number of T-suppressor cells remained unchanged. These data provide evidence of T-cell involvement in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Total lymphoid irradiation can induce sustained improvement in clinical disease activity, but severe, possibly fatal, side-effects cannot be ignored.\r"

A group of 128 normal subjects from the same region were typed for comparison. Although the frequencies of HLA-B7 and DR2 in the patient group (43.3% and 49.4%, respectively) were found to be similar to those reported for other Northern European HLA studies on patients with MS, high frequencies of these antigens were also observed in the group of normal Grampian subjects (38.3% and 40.6%) the differences were not statistically significant. However, a significant association was found between the recently defined Class II HLA antigen, DQw1, and MS (P less than 0.006) when compared with controls. There were no significant differences in frequency of the polymorphisms of C4, C2, and Bf when the group of patients with MS was compared with the control group of normal subjects. The patients were subdivided according to disease severity, remittent versus progressive clinical course, age of onset of the disease and initial symptoms. The frequencies of the HLA and complement polymorphisms (C4, C2, and Bf) were analysed in these subdivisions. DQw1 was found with similar frequency in severe and benign disease (78% and 80%, respectively) but DR2 was most frequent in the group of patients with remittent disease (54%). There were no significant differences in frequency of the polymorphisms of C4, C2, and Bf between the above subgroups of patients and overall no significant HLA associations were found with age of onset of disease or initial symptoms. The findings suggest that in an area of high prevalence of MS, the disease is more closely associated with DQw1 than DR2. Furthermore, there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that the HLA region complement gene polymorphisms show significant association with a putative HLA-linked MS susceptibility gene.\r"

A diffuse lymphocytic lymphoma with small bowel, skin, and hepatic involvement subsequently developed in the patient. Light microscopy of the tumor revealed tissue infiltration with mononuclear cells having the morphologic features of T-lymphocytes. The malignant lymphocytes had characteristics of T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells as established by the absence of surface immunoglobulin and Leu 3 surface markers, and the presence of OKT3 and OKT8 surface markers. Peripheral blood lymphocyte studies revealed an increased number of T-suppressor cells, a reversal of the helper-suppressor ratio, and a generalized state of hyporesponsiveness to mitogen and antigen stimulation. No evidence of retroviral reverse transcriptase activity was detected in cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes. The association between CVH and a lymphoma composed of cells with T-suppressor/cytotoxic surface markers has not been previously reported. The postulated role of T-suppressor cells in the failure of immunoglobulin synthesis in some forms of CVH suggests that the finding of a T-suppressor/cytotoxic cell lymphoma complicating CVH may be more than fortuitous.\r"

As a whole, patients with MM did not differ from normal controls or from patients with a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, but a significant percentage of abnormal values of SBGP was found in this MM population (18% of cases, P less than 0.005). At the time of diagnosis, SBGP was significantly lower in advanced disease (Stage III) than in less active disease (Stage I and II) with mean values of 4.4 +/- 2.7 ng/ml and 7.1 +/- 1.9 ng/ml, respectively (P less than 0.02). SBGP levels inversely correlated with the severity of the disease, the lowest values being observed in patients with extensive lytic bone lesions frequently associated with hypercalcemia (2.9 +/- 1.7 ng/ml). These data suggest the presence of a strong osteoblastic inhibition, at the body level, in the majority of patients (80%) with active osteoclastic MM (uncoupled process). However, a small subset of myeloma patients (20%) presented coupled MM, as defined by increased bone resorption (i.e., lytic bone lesions +/- hypercalcemia) and increased bone formation (i.e., increased SBGP values). Similar features of coupling-uncoupling were observed during disease progression. Finally, serial studies performed in 15 patients confirm these findings and the relation of SBGP levels to disease activity. Of major interest was the observation of a return of SBGP levels from low to normal values during remission induction, after successful completion of a plateau phase. According to these data, SBGP appears to be a new and promising marker for the clinical evaluation of MM.\r"

A dose of 50 X 10(6) U/m2, three times per week, was used initially, then adjusted downward as dictated by toxic effects. A 54% response rate was achieved among 24 patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and the median duration of response was 8 months. Less encouraging results emerged from studies in patients with intermediate- or high-grade disease. Responses were noted in only two of six patients in the former group, and only one of seven in the latter group. Results have likewise been disappointing in patients with CLL. Of 18 individuals treated, only two exhibited brief, partial responses. In CTCL, on the other hand, alpha interferon may be the most effective single agent. Among 20 patients with advanced disease who had failed previous therapies, 45% responded. The primary dose-limiting toxicity in all these trials has been flu-like symptoms, particularly fever and fatigue. Fever has generally resolved as treatment has been continued, but dosage reductions are usually necessary to alleviate fatigue. Future studies are likely to focus on the use of alpha interferon in combination with chemotherapeutic agents or other biologic response modifiers, such as monoclonal antibodies.\r"

Unfortunately, most reports have involved small patient cohorts and a variety of dosages and schedules of administration. We report here a series of Phase II trials with interferon alfa-2b (Intron A, Schering Corp., Kenilworth, NJ) involving 114 patients using three dose regimens. Patients received 50 X 10(6) IU/m2 intravenously (high dose), 30 X 10(6) IU/m2 subcutaneously (intermediate dose), or 1 X 10(6) IU/m2 subcutaneously (low dose). Clinical responses were seen in all regimens and, overall, 35% of the patients obtained complete or partial remissions. The response rates in the low-, intermediate-, and high-dose groups were 33%, 28%, and 45%, respectively. In addition, high-dose therapy was associated with more rapid time to response. Patients with low-stage (I or II) disease and those who lack B symptoms were more likely to respond to therapy; i.e., response rates for patients without B symptoms were 38%, 44%, and 60% in the low-, intermediate-, and high-dose groups, respectively. Seventy (61%) patients had died at the time of data collection, with a median survival of 15 months. Disease stage and the presence of B symptoms significantly affected mortality. Responders enjoyed significantly longer survival (P less than 0.10) than did nonresponders both overall and when adjusted for disease stage. Interferon alfa-2b was generally well tolerated, although almost all patients experienced flu-like symptoms. No life-threatening toxicities occurred and only six (6%) patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. No significant improvement in immunologic parameters was detected during this study. These studies suggest that, in this disease setting, interferon alfa-2b may be acting through direct antiproliferative effects rather than as an immunomodulator, and higher doses appear to be more effective than very low doses.\r"

Before the introduction of the regimen, the primary tumor in two patients was treated by immediate amputation and in 13 with preoperative intra-arterial CDP. Among these 13 patients, responses (healing) were observed in 11 (one required the addition of radiation therapy). In three patients, the responses were so dramatic that, at their request, surgery was deferred and treatment exclusively with chemotherapy was instituted. Based on this experience, treatment exclusively with chemotherapy was also administered to an additional five patients who were admitted without pathologic fractures. In the course of such treatment, pathologic fractures also developed; notwithstanding, chemotherapy was maintained and healing also occurred. One of the 20 patients had pulmonary metastases at diagnosis; these were resected after treatment and pathologic examination revealed no evidence of viable tumor. The remaining 19 patients were free of pulmonary metastases but these later developed in seven patients. These data were compared to a historical control series in which 16 of 21 patients with pathologic fractures developed pulmonary metastases. Three of the chemotherapy treated patients died of nonosteosarcoma related causes (leukemia, generalized varicella, and a metabolic complication). Overall, survival was improved in the chemotherapy treated patients as compared to the historical control series: 10 of 20 versus 6 of 21, respectively. Pathologic fractures in osteosarcoma may heal under treatment with chemotherapy, which also has a favorable impact on the eradication of pulmonary metastases and survival.\r"

  ".W": "A syndrome of persistent, generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), related to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), has been described in homosexual men. To further characterize and correlate the immunologic status of patients with PGL with those in AIDS, we studied spontaneous and pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-induced IgG synthesis by B-cells, T-cell subsets in peripheral blood (PB), natural cytotoxicity (NC), and Interleukins (IL)-1 and IL-2 production in 39 homosexual patients (21 PGL; 13 AIDS; five asymptomatic homosexual men), in whom 32 of 35 tested (91%) had antibodies to human T-lymphotropic virus-III (HTLV-III). A profound abnormality in B-cell function was found in AIDS and PGL, consisting of high spontaneous IgG production, with paradoxic suppression of IgG synthesis after PWM. IL-2 values were more often low in AIDS when compared with PGL (P less than 0.001). The PB lymphocyte count was normal in PGL and reduced in AIDS (P less than 0.001). OKT4 \"helper\" cells were decreased in PGL, but even lower in AIDS (P less than 0.001), while OKT8 \"cytotoxic/suppressor\" cells were normal in AIDS and increased in PGL (P less than 0.01). The T4:T8 ratio was reversed in both, but more abnormal in AIDS (P less than 0.001). A decrease in NC killing was observed in AIDS when compared with heterosexual controls. Thus, patients with PGL and AIDS both demonstrate a spectrum of immunologic dysfunction, involving the cellular and humoral arms of the immune system.\r"

  ".W": "The available staging systems for B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) do not always predict the clinical course and the prognosis of the disease. In these systems, the pattern of bone marrow histology is not incorporated. In the current report we investigate the prognostic value of the diffuse or nondiffuse pattern of bone marrow involvement in 120 B-CLL patients in relation to their actuarial survival, and we compare these results with the actuarial survival based on the International Workshop system. In addition, we analyze the influence of the diffuse or nondiffuse pattern on the actuarial survival, in relation to the individual clinical stages (A, B, C). All patients were diagnosed and followed-up in the same Unit. Our patients were divided into Stage A (64), Stage B (22), and Stage C (34). They were also subdivided into those with a diffuse (46) and those with a nondiffuse (74) pattern of bone marrow histology. The difference in the actuarial survival in relation to their clinical stage (A, B, C) was statistically significant (P less than 0.025). A greater statistical difference (P less than 0.005) was found when the actuarial survival was analyzed in relation to the diffuse or nondiffuse pattern of bone marrow histology. No statistically significant differences could be found (P greater than 0.1), when the actuarial survival was calculated in every stage (A, B, C), on the basis of the diffuse or nondiffuse pattern of bone marrow histology. When our Stage A and B patients were analyzed for disease progression, in relation to the diffuse or nondiffuse bone marrow histology, it was found that 66.6% of the diffuse Stage A patients and 88% of the diffuse Stage B patients had disease progression as compared to only 8.6% for the nondiffuse Stage A patients and 33% for the nondiffuse Stage B patients. Our findings indicate that: the pattern of bone marrow histology in B-CLL patients is the single most important prognostic parameter in this disease; a clinicopathologic staging system for B-CLL may be justified; and the diffuse pattern of bone marrow histology could be considered as the best criterion for initiation of therapy in these patients.\r"

At baseline, prevalence rates of ST-T abnormalities were age related for both sexes, and at every age the rate was higher in women than men (age-adjusted prevalence rates 12.3% and 8.1%, respectively). Univariate analysis showed that ST-T abnormalities were associated with significantly increased risk of death from CHD for both men and women. However, men with ST-T abnormalities had much greater age-adjusted and multiple risk factor-adjusted absolute excess risk and relative risk than women with such electrocardiographic abnormalities. When baseline age, diastolic pressure, serum cholesterol, cigarettes/day, history of diabetes, and baseline use of antihypertensive medication were included in the multivariate analysis, ST-T abnormalities remained significantly related to death from CHD in men but not women. The interaction term between sex and ST-T abnormalities was at a borderline level of statistical significance by Cox regression analysis. In conclusion, ST-T abnormalities indicate an increased risk of subsequent death from CHD independent of major coronary risk factors for middle-aged U.S. men, but this is not clearly so for women.\r"

Alloantibodies produced by leucocyte immunization (conventionally induced antisera) were directed only to RT1-encoded (major histocompatibility complex, MHC) antigens. Both RT1A (class I MHC) and either RT1B, D (class II MHC) or RT1C (Qa-like) antigens were targets for these alloantibodies; responses to the latter three antigens could not be separated with available congenic recombinant inbred rat strains. Alloantibodies produced as a consequence of multiple semi-allogeneic pregnancies (pregnancy-induced antisera) were directed only to RT1A antigens. Allogeneic pregnancies in which the paternal strain differed from the maternal strain only at the RT1A gene locus produced suppression of a subsequent maternal immune response.\r"

Forty patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass grafting were prospectively divided into two groups according to age below 45 years (group 1; n = 20) and above 65 years (group 2; n = 20). The EVLW was measured using the double indicator dilution technique with indocyanine green as the nondiffusible indicator. Starting from similar baseline values before extracorporeal circulation (ECC), EVLW significantly increased after ECC only in the elderly patients (max + 1.51 ml/kg), whereas lung water content in the other group remained almost unchanged. No significant differences in left ventricular filling pressure (PCP) could be observed. Regression analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between age and increase in EVLW after ECC. Simultaneously, PaO2 was decreased (-114 mm Hg) and intrapulmonary shunt fraction (Qs/Qt) was increased only in this group. Within the next five hours after ECC, lung water returned nearly to baseline values and pulmonary function was normalized. It is concluded that increasing age was associated with a transient increase in EVLW after ECC due to a more pronounced fragility of the pulmonary endothelial membrane or/and to depressed left ventricular performance.\r"

Published clinical indices as well as variety of laboratory parameters were measured. The clinical indices and the serum C-reactive protein, orosomucoid, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and iron were increased at the time of the attack as compared to three months earlier, while only the clinical indices, orosomucoid and alpha 1-antitrypsin increased between three months and one month prior to the attack.

Community-acquired overwhelming pneumonias are usually due to pyogenic bacteria (especially Streptococcus pneumoniae), mycoplasma, mycobacteria, and fungi. Hospital-acquired pneumonias are usually due to aerobic gram-negative bacilli. If the patient is immunocompromised, Pneumocystis carinii, Candida, and Aspergillus must be considered. Choice of optimal antimicrobial therapy requires that a specific etiology be identified. Gram's stain of sputum is often helpful in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Invasive diagnostic techniques such as bronchoscopy and open lung biopsy are often required in nosocomial pneumonias and pneumonias in immunocompromised patients.\r"

The aim of this study was to assess change in serum bone Gla protein (BGP) after low and high dose cortisone acetate treatment and to assess whether these alterations are altered or attenuated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] administration. Five groups of rats were studied and compared to a control group [cortisone acetate in doses of 0.2, 3.3, and 5.0 mg/100 g BW; 1,25-(OH)2D3 in a dose of 100 ng/100 g BW; and a combination of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (100 ng/100 g BW) plus cortisone acetate (3.3 mg/100 g BW)]. Each animal received daily sc injections for 27 days. BGP decreased significantly by day 7 in the two groups receiving high doses of cortisone acetate compared to control group values (65.20 +/- 4.38 vs. 150.18 +/- 6.13 ng/ml in the intermediate dose group and 91.57 +/- 5.30 vs. 150.18 +/- 6.13 ng/ml in the high dose group; P less than 0.01); this effect persisted until day 28. Histomorphometry revealed decreased formation and resorption in the two high dose cortisone acetate groups, whereas low dose cortisone acetate produced no histological change. The combination therapy lessens any change in BGP until day 28 when BGP was lower than the control value (P less than 0.01); histomorphometry showed that combination therapy prevents the effect of cortisone acetate by increasing bone formation and resorption. The data demonstrate that high doses of cortisone acetate suppress bone formation and that this is reflected in the low serum BGP values. Thus, BGP may be a marker of glucocorticoid-induced bone disease. 1,25-(OH)2D3 protects against glucocorticoid-induced bone disease and the normal BGP level reflects this.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of long term exposure to epidermal growth factor (EGF) on thyroid hormone responses as well as the concentration of specific nuclear thyroid hormone receptors in GH4C1 rat pituitary tumor cells. GH4C1 cells were first incubated for 48 h in medium with 5% fetal calf serum depleted of thyroid hormones by ion exchange resin. EGF had no effect on thyroid hormone receptors after 2 h, but decreased [125I]T3 binding to 56% of control values at 24 h and 68% at 48 h. L-T3 (0.5 nM) caused down-regulation of thyroid hormone receptors, and addition of EGF caused a further decrease. T3 alone (0.5 nM) caused a 2- to 3-fold induction of GH after 48 h, and GH induction was significantly inhibited by the addition of 10 nM EGF. Scatchard analysis of specific nuclear [125I]T3 binding showed that 48-h incubation with 10 nM EGF decreased T3 receptors from a Bmax of 2.35 to 1.26 pmol/mg DNA in thyroid hormone-depleted medium without affecting receptor affinity (Kd, 80 pM). The decrease in nuclear thyroid hormone receptors caused by EGF was dose dependent, with half-maximal inhibition at 0.10 nM EGF. EGF attenuated the GH response to T3 with similar dose-response characteristics. When cells were incubated for 48 h with different concentrations of T3, EGF (10 nM) decreased thyroid hormone receptors to 56-72% of control values regardless of the dose of T3, and EGF shifted the ED50 for T3 stimulation of GH from 0.1 to 1.2 nM. EGF also reduced from 5- to 1.8-fold the increase in cell number caused by thyroid hormone over 2 weeks. In contrast, EGF stimulation of PRL synthesis was changed only slightly by thyroid hormone at all times. In conclusion, we demonstrate that low concentrations of EGF decrease nuclear thyroid hormone receptors and thyroid hormone responses; this may be the mechanism by which EGF suppresses T3-induced GH production in GH4C1 cells.\r"

Hypopituitary Snell dwarf mice were injected with TSH (25, 50, or 100 mU/day) alone or complexed with MAB-GC73 once per day for 5 days; control animals received PBS. Radioactive sulfate (35SO4(2-)) was also injected on the fifth day and animals were killed 20 h later. Thyroids were removed for histology, blood taken for T4 estimations by RIA, and 35SO4(2-) uptake into costal cartilage in vivo was measured. In control mice thyroid histology revealed small follicles comprised of small flattened epithelial cells with a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio; colloid was dark with little vacuolation. In animals treated with TSH alone there was moderate evidence of activation in most of these features. However, a marked response was noted in animals treated with TSH plus MAB-GC73; characteristically, there was little interfollicular tissue and the follicles, which were large and comprised of cuboidal cells, contained pale, finely vacuolated cytoplasm. Both TSH alone and TSH complexed with MAB-GC73 promoted a significant dose-dependent increase in serum T4 levels. The two higher doses of TSH plus MAB-GC73 promoted a significantly greater increase in serum levels of T4 than that in groups receiving the same dose of TSH alone. Uptake of 35SO4(2-) into costal cartilage showed a significant correlation with serum T4 levels. In similar experiments significant increases in salivary gland epidermal growth factor content of male dwarf mice were observed. This work demonstrated that MAB enhancement of hormone action is not restricted to human GH, suggesting a more general phenomenon.\r"

The goal of the current study was to determine how changes in receptor turnover could give rise to increased receptor levels after treatment with 24,25-(OH)2D3, whether by an increased rate of synthesis or a decreased rate of degradation. Receptor turnover was studied by the dense amino acid shift technique in cultured pig kidney cells (LLC-PK1). In control cells, the half-life of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor was estimated to be 4.3 +/- 0.4 h, with a degradation rate constant (kD) of 0.16 +/- 0.01 h-1. In parallel experiments, cells were treated with 24,25-(OH)2D3 for about 48 h to reach a new up-regulated steady state before the measurement of receptor turnover. In up-regulated cells, the receptor half-life was prolonged to 8.9 +/- 1.0 h and the kD was 0.07 +/- 0.01 h-1. Assuming a steady state, the values obtained for total receptor levels and the degradation rate allow calculation of the synthesis rate (kS) at equilibrium. Control cells synthesized receptors at the rate of 3.4 +/- 0.4 vs. up-regulated cells at 4.9 +/- 0.5 fmol mg protein-1 h-1. In conclusion, the data indicate that up-regulation of receptors after exposure of cells to vitamin D metabolites results predominantly from a prolongation of receptor half-life in addition to a relatively smaller increase in the rate of receptor synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Since epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been postulated to play a role in embryonic and fetal growth, a study was undertaken to assess the placental degradation and transfer of maternally administered EGF. Before iodination, mouse EGF was purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC. Approximately 5 ng [125I]iodo-EGF (approximately 10(6) cpm) were injected iv into day 10, day 13, or day 17 pregnant CD-1 mice; radioactivity in plasma, placentas, and conceptuses was measured up to 2 h after injection. The time course analysis revealed an initial rapid decline in total plasma radioactivity followed by an increase that was maximal by approximately 30 min. Gel filtration (G-15, G-50) chromatography of plasma revealed that by 5 min, radioactivity was associated with free 125I and with material much larger than EGF. No apparent degradation of [125I]iodo-EGF occurred after direct incubation with maternal plasma. Placental radioactivity had an initial phase of decay between 1 and 5 min followed by an increase that became maximal between 30 and 60 min. Extracts of placentas made with 4 M urea in 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and taken 1-30 min after injection revealed radioactivity coeluting predominantly with [125I]iodo-EGF at 1 min but shifting to mostly free 125I by 30 min. Uptake of radioactivity by conceptuses was not evident until about 15 min, and only free 125I was detected in extracts; the same results were obtained when 5 micrograms unlabeled EGF were injected simultaneously with [125I]iodo-EGF. Incubation of placental mince with [125I]iodo-EGF yielded [125I]MIT as the apparent major radioactive degradation product. Formation of [125I]MIT in vitro was both time- and temperature-dependent. At 37 C, marked formation of [125I]MIT was observed; at 22 C, only a negligible amount was formed after incubation of mince with [125I]iodo-EGF for 60 min. Incubation of [125I]iodo-EGF with kidney mince yielded predominantly free 125I. When tissues were incubated directly with [125I]MIT, kidney tissue deiodinated the [125I]MIT, but placental tissue did not. When [125I]iodo-EGF was incubated for up to 2 h with kidney tissue in the presence of excess MIT (unlabeled), the major degradation product eluted as [125I]MIT, instead of free 125I. These findings suggest that the mouse placenta can readily bind and then degrade [125I]iodo-EGF to constituent amino acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the course of studies of cell-mediated immunity in Graves' disease, we noted that normal peripheral blood monocytes, when stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide, conditioned their media with a factor that had the physicochemical properties of the lymphokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) and that enhanced DNA synthesis and replication in quiescent FRTL5 cells, a line of nontransformed rat thyroid follicular cells. This finding led to the present studies, in which the effect of IL-1 (recombinant IL-1-p) on DNA synthesis in FRTL5 was explored. In the absence of serum, IL-1 induced a small, but significant, increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Calf serum (0.5%) alone also stimulated DNA synthesis slightly, but it greatly enhanced, in a synergistic manner, the stimulatory response to IL-1, decreasing the minimally effective concentration of IL-1 and amplifying the response to higher concentrations. A similar synergism was noted when quiescent FRTL5 were cultured with a combination of IL-1 and a low concentration of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which itself stimulated DNA synthesis modestly. IL-1 also increased levels of the mRNA of the proto-oncogene c-myc in quiescent FRTL5, as TSH does, an effect thought to reflect commitment of the cell to increased growth. The findings indicate that IL-1 is an independent stimulator of thyroid cell growth, and that its effects are greatly enhanced by serum, probably in large measure by the IGF-I contained therein. They raise the possibility that IL-1 generated locally by intrathyroid macrophages may act directly by a short-loop mechanism to increase goiter formation in autoimmune thyroid disease.\r"

  ".W": "Aprotinin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of [125I]hCG binding to its receptor in plasma membranes prepared from luteinized rat ovaries. Displacement of [125I]hCG from its receptor by aprotinin was temperature dependent, with an ID50 of 300 microM at 4 C and an ID50 of 3700 microM at 22 C. Equilibrium binding data showed a decrease in the Ka for hCG in the presence of increasing concentrations of aprotinin; aprotinin had no effect on the number of binding sites. The rate of association of hCG with its receptor was markedly reduced in the presence of aprotinin, but aprotinin had little effect on the rate of dissociation. Control experiments established that aprotinin did not inhibit the binding of [125I]hCG to its receptor due to its lectin properties, an ionic effect or some irreversible impairment of the receptor or hormone. Aprotinin did not inhibit hCG binding when the receptor was solubilized out of ovarian membranes with Triton X-100. Aprotinin inhibited the hCG-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase in rat ovarian plasma membranes in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, aprotinin antagonized the hCG-stimulated biosynthesis of progesterone by dispersed rat luteal cells. The maximal agonistic activity of hCG was attenuated in these two bioassays. The data are compatible with a hypothesis that aprotinin sterically hinders the entry of hCG into its receptor site by binding to a protease in the plasma membrane that is closely associated with the hCG receptor. This proposal is consistent with the emerging concept that integral membrane proteases are modulators of receptor function.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of rat CRF, arginine vasopressin (VP), oxytocin (OXY), and isoproterenol (ISO) on the biosynthesis and release of pro-ACTH/endorphin-derived peptides by monolayer cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells in complete serum-free medium (CSFM) were studied. When cells were exposed to hormone for 3 h, CRF, VP, OXY, and ISO were each able to stimulate secretion of immunoactive hormone into culture medium. To determine the effects of chronic secretagogue exposure on corticotrope function, cultures were exposed to hormone for 14 days, and total hormone production was measured by immunoassay (cumulative hormone secreted plus cell hormone content). In the absence of CRF, total hormone production increased 3.6 +/- 0.2-fold (mean +/- SEM) over the period from 2-14 days; chronic CRF treatment brought about a 7.9 +/- 0.7-fold increase in total hormone production over the same period (P less than 0.0025) or a 2.2-fold increase over control cells. Total hormone production was not affected by chronic treatment with VP (100 nM), OXY (100 nM), or ISO (100 nM); the response of the cells to chronic CRF treatment was unaltered by chronic inclusion of VP, OXY, or ISO. To examine the chronic effects of secretagogues more directly, anterior pituitary cells were grown in control CSFM or in CSFM containing CRF or VP for 7 days and then incubated in medium containing radiolabeled amino acid for 15 min. The newly synthesized pro-ACTH/endorphin was quantified by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Cells grown in CSFM containing CRF synthesized 1.9 times more labeled pro-ACTH/endorphin that cells grown in control CSFM or in CSFM containing VP. Chronic exposure of anterior pituitary cultures to 8-bromo-cAMP stimulated both synthesis and release of pro-ACTH/endorphin-derived peptides, suggesting that a secretagogue capable of producing a sustained elevation in intracellular cAMP levels will stimulate prohormone synthesis.\r"

There are two factors contributing to this influence: the doctor's status as an observer and as an observed subject. A model for analysing this influence is presented. In a Norwegian general practice study of the recording of conditions suspected of being cancer the changes owing to the recording itself have been studied by three different means: indicator comparison, time-trend analysis and post-registration enquiry. The study showed that the effect of the recording was small, and this was perhaps a result of prophylactic efforts by the doctors to minimize the influence. An influence on the doctors' actions and thinking during a period of registration should always be expected, and control methods to give a semi-quantitative expression of the consequences of this influence should therefore be carried out.\r"

Twenty-eight active index bleeders and 20 active rebleeders were treated by immediate endoscopic injection sclerosis, which could technically be performed on all of the former and in 18 of the rebleeders (96%). Immediate control of active bleeding was achieved in all patients whose varices were injected (100%). Control at 48 hours was 89% for the index bleeding group and 80% for the rebleeding group. In the delayed sclerotherapy group of 19 patients, initial control (79%) and 48-hour control (64%) were significantly less. The rebleeding rate, complications, and death from exsanguination were greater in the delayed group, whereas longevity was similar in both groups. We conclude that immediate sclerotherapy effectively controls acutely bleeding esophageal varices with a lower complication rate than sclerotherapy performed after conventional medical therapy with vasopressin and Sengstaken-Blakemore tube tamponade.\r"

Oral administration of synthetic human EGF/URO stimulated gastric ulcer healing when examined after 25 and 50 days of treatment. The effect of synthetic human EGF/URO was comparable with that of cimetidine. The combined administration of synthetic human EGF/URO and cimetidine further increased healing of gastric ulcers compared with administration of each substance. Neither synthetic human EGF/URO, nor removal of the submandibular glands had any influence on gastric acid secretion.

Mucosal formation and luminal release of PGE2, 6-keto-PGE1 alpha and thromboxane B2, gastric microbleeding and DNA loss (integrity indicators) and basal and pentagastrin induced acid secretion were measured after placebo and sucralfate treatment in subjects without (group A) and with administration of 2.5 g aspirin (group B). Sucralfate significantly reduced spontaneous gastric microbleeding and DNA loss in group A and prevented blood loss but not DNA loss caused by aspirin in group B. The protective effects of sucralfate on spontaneous gastric microbleeding were accompanied by increased mucosal biosynthesis and luminal release of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha with a reduction in release of thromboxane B2. In aspirin treated subjects both mucosal generation and luminal release of prostaglandins and thromboxane B2 were greatly suppressed although sucralfate treatment did not influence these prostaglandins in spite of the reduction in mucosal damage. It is concluded that sucralfate has a potent protective action on spontaneous and aspirin treated gastric microbleeding in man and that this protection may be partly because of the increased mucosal biosynthesis of prostaglandins.\r"

  ".W": "To analyze the correlations between the presence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular inflammation and the serum concentrations of the amino-terminal peptide of procollagen type III in chronic liver disease, we measured procollagen type III concentrations in paired serum samples from 46 patients (17 had cirrhosis) with severe chronic active hepatitis during a therapeutic treatment trial. Coded sera were analyzed for procollagen type III concentrations using both a standard and a recently described Fab radioimmunoassay to compare their relative diagnostic accuracy. Mean procollagen type III levels were elevated to the same extent in the cirrhotic and noncirrhotic groups at entry into the study. In response to immunosuppressive therapy, the initially elevated procollagen type III levels improved to normal values at remission in both groups. Qualitatively, the results were similar using either assay, but the standard assay was more sensitive for identifying the clinical stage of disease (i.e., active disease vs. disease in remission) than the Fab assay. Since both procollagen type III levels and standard liver function tests correlated well individually with the presence or absence of active disease, they also correlated with each other when both entry and remission values were considered. However, procollagen type III levels correlated poorly with indicators of inflammation (histologic grade and serum transaminase levels) during active disease. It is concluded that procollagen type III levels change in concert with standard liver function tests but do not quantitatively reflect inflammation or static measurements of hepatic fibrosis in severe chronic active hepatitis. However, these preliminary results suggest that procollagen type III can distinguish active disease from chronic active hepatitis in remission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, intravenous injection of EP produced fever in both sexes, but females generally showed smaller responses. A second intravenous injection of endotoxin, given 3 days after the first injection, always produced fever in normally hydrated rats. The pattern of this febrile response was monophasic. In contrast to the response in normal rats, intravenous endotoxin produced significant fevers with a biphasic pattern in dehydrated rats of either sex, but the febrile responses of male rats were greater than those of female rats. On the other hand, there were no significant differences between febrile responses to intravenous EP exhibited by normal and dehydrated animals.

Mean follow-up period was 29 months (range 12-65 months). Early mortality was 5% (2 patients) and there were seven late deaths (3 cardiac and 4 non-cardiac). The five-year cardiac actuarial survival rate was 74% +/- 13% (+/- SEM). Angina has improved in 29 (94%) of the 31 long-term survivors with 23 (74%) being totally asymptomatic. Twenty-two of the long-term survivors performed an exercise test at the end of their follow-up period. These tests revealed that bypass surgery in such patients results in significantly enhanced myocardial oxygen consumption with concomitant increase in effort level and duration. The exercise ability is probably directly related to the degree of revascularization.\r"

  ".W": "Fourty four patients underwent emergency coronary grafting for evolving myocardial infarction. All patients but one had undergone coronary angiography before the new infarction, 50% were in cardiogenic shock or under cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The mean time interval between the onset symptoms and opening of the bypass to the threatened area was 171 minutes. The operative mortality was 6.8%. At 30 months after surgery, the cardiac actuarial survival was 93.2%, the angina free group 94.2% of the operative survivors. Infarct size and regional ejection fraction of these patients at late follow-up were compared to those of controls treated conventionally for acute infarction. The thallium defects were smaller and the regional ejection fraction of the involved segment was higher after early surgery (less than 3 hours ischemia) than in controls. In the late surgery group the thallium defects and the regional ejection fractions were similar. Ultrastructural studies on biopsy samples taken from the center of the threatened area show reversible changes in the early surgery group but irreversible mitochondrial damage and cell membrane rupture in the late surgery group. Biochemical analysis of similar cardiac biopsies shows recovery after one hour empty beating reperfusion but only in the early surgery group. Our results suggest that coronary surgery can be beneficial to the patient with an evolving myocardial infarction, if the clinical situation does not permit intracoronary thrombolysis. However, one hour reperfusion of the empty beating heart before weaning off bypass is essential. The time constraints for both emergency surgery or thrombolysis are similar.\r"

Red cell deformability was assessed in vitro by estimating red cell filtration rate (RFR). Urea was given to 32 patients during surgery and the remaining 43 acted as controls. After one hour on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) all patients showed a significant reduction of red cell filtration rate which continually worsened. In control patients where the RFR was severely altered there appeared to be more morbidity and mortality (11.6%). Using this simple method it is possible for the perfusionist to assess blood damage rapidly and possibly anticipate a difficult postoperative recovery. Urea administered during CPB reduced the decrease in RFR by a significant extent and in these patients the postoperative course was relatively uneventful and all survived.\r"

Activity was uniformly decreased in association with hyperthyroxinemia, regardless of the underlying pathology; however, there was no reduction in the number of NKH-1+ cells. NK activity was enhanced by addition of interleukin 2 (IL-2) in both control and patients' cells although the value in the latter instance failed to reach the basal control level. Production of IL-2 by lymphocytes from hyperthyroxinemic subjects, in response to phytohemagglutinin, was also reduced. Since NK cells are thought to act as a defense against viral infections and some malignancies and may play a role in autoregulation of the immune system, this effect of T4 may have significant biological implications.\r"

Three new public idiotopes, which were common to monoclonal antibodies from all three patients, were defined by five polyclonal rabbit antiidiotypes, two monoclonal mouse antiidiotopes, and a monoclonal mouse antibody against a synthetic peptide that contains residues of the heavy chain CDR-1 of a monoclonal lupus anti-DNA antibody. The antibody against the synthetic idiotype was found to react with native immunoglobulins in solution. One idiotope was found to be consistently immunogenic in all animals tested. Since the three patients are of different ethnic origins, these shared idiotypes are probably encoded by germline V genes. These genes may be recurrently expressed in states of polyclonal B-cell activation, regardless of etiology. The results suggest that some autoantibodies arise by expansion of a pool of precursors in the normal antibody repertoire.\r"

Umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured on microcarriers and loaded with the Ca2+ indicator, indo-1. Enzymatic cell detachment was avoided by monitoring the indo-1 fluorescence ratio (400/480 nm) of a stirred suspension of cell-covered microcarriers. Basal [Ca2+]c was estimated to be 70-80 nM. Thrombin induced a transient dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]c, which was active-site dependent. Histamine stimulated a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]c, which was reversed by removal of histamine and inhibited competitively by the H1-receptor antagonist pyrilamine, but not by the H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine. Furthermore, histamine induced a dose-dependent secretion of von Willebrand factor, which paralleled the rise in [Ca2+]c and was similarly blocked by the H1-receptor antagonist, and which may contribute to platelet deposition at sites of inflammation.\r"

Moles were counted on the chest, back, and lower legs. Skin complexion was established with the use of a scoring system based on burning/tanning ability, eye and hair color, and freckling tendency. A multifactorial statistical analysis was performed. Average mole counts increased with age (p less than 0.0001). Male subjects had more nevi on the trunk than female subjects, whereas counts on the lower legs were higher in female than in male subjects (p = 0.0001). Skin complexion was an important denominator of mole proneness; subjects with a light complexion had higher mean counts than those with a dark complexion (p = 0.0001). The present study shows that a significant association exists between skin complexion phenotype and numbers of moles. The pattern of the appearance of pigmented nevi roughly correlates with the sex and site distribution of melanoma.\r"

Perioperative rupture of the left ventricular myocardium complicated seven operations (1.2%), five of them in the 247 patients with concomitant ischemic heart disease. Six ruptures were fatal. Relative incidences of seven previously hypothesized predisposing factors were determined for patients with and without myocardial rupture. In addition, because of the apparent frequency of association with ischemic heart disease and because all ruptures were posterior or posterolateral, patients were also categorized by prior history of posterior myocardial infarction: 177 patients had none, whereas 49 patients had a remote and 21 patients a recent (less than or equal to 1 month) posterior wall infarct. Four ruptures (accounting for 57% of all ruptures) occurred in the 21 patients (19% incidence) with a recent posterior infarct, compared with only three ruptures in the 587 patients (0.5%) without a recent posterior wall infarct (p = 0.000). None of the factors of age, sex, valve pathology, etiology of valve lesion, concomitant coronary disease, valve substitute or intraoperative myocardial preservation were associated with perioperative rupture. These data establish a low overall incidence of ventricular rupture after mitral valve replacement, high fatality and possible etiologic association with recent posterior wall infarction.\r"

The greatest increase in prevalence occurred among children and teenagers (22.2% and 19.5%) with only minimal increases after the age of 65 years (6.0%). No difference in prevalence between male and female subjects was apparent, either initially or at the end of the follow-up period. In-migration to the Tucson area was a major factor in determining changes in reaction prevalence. Among subjects more than 35 years of age, recent in-migrants accounted for most of the increased prevalence. Comparisons of atopy among consistent smoking groups confirmed the previous observation that smokers are less atopic than either nonsmokers or exsmokers, probably because of a self-selection process. In contrast, exsmokers were generally the most atopic, both initially and at the end of the longitudinal observation period. The high overall prevalence of allergen reactivity in this population is believed to be due in large measure to high year-round concentrations of multiple aeroallergens in the Tucson environment.\r"

Without affecting cell viability, in vitro irradiation inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion de novo IgE synthesis in vitro by B cells from all patients examined with a mean 40% reduction of in vitro IgE product after treatment with 100 rads. In contrast, the in vitro IgE production by the U266 myeloma cell line was unaffected, even by irradiation with 1600 rads. The addition to B cell cultures from atopic patients of FK consistently resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the spontaneous IgE production in vitro. The addition to cultures of 10(-5) and 10(-6) molar concentrations of HC was also usually inhibitory, whereas lower HC concentrations were uneffective or even enhanced the spontaneous in vitro IgE synthesis. When 10(-6) molar concentrations of both HC and FK were combined in culture, a summation inhibitory effect on the spontaneous IgE synthesis was observed. In contrast, neither FK nor HC had inhibitory effect on the in vitro spontaneous IgE synthesis by the U266 myeloma cell line. The spontaneous in vitro IgE synthesis by B cells from patients with Hodgkin's disease, demonstrating high levels of serum IgE, was strongly reduced or virtually abolished after patients underwent total nodal irradiation to prevent the spread of the disease. In addition, the in vitro spontaneous IgE synthesis by B cells from atopic patients was markedly decreased or abolished by in vivo administration of betamethasone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tritiated thymidine incorporation, blast formation, and protein synthesis were all induced in accessory cell-depleted thymocytes by autologous TE cells in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of PHA. After 3 days of mitogen stimulation of thymocyte-TE cell cocultures in vitro, thymocyte blasts bound to TE cells and 77 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) of TE cells acquired expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (DR) antigen. TE accessory cell function for thymocyte activation was dependent on the number of TE cells added to thymocyte cultures, was not dependent on TE cell division, but did require TE cell protein synthesis. In thymocyte separation experiments, the predominant cell type responding to PHA in the presence of TE cells was T6- mature (stage III) thymocytes. Thus, human TE cells are capable of providing signals that lead to mature thymocyte activation.\r"

The aim of this study was to find possible relationships between the proliferating thymoma epithelial cell type and the T cell composition of thymomas. Our results indicate that cortical T cell differentiation is present in thymomas, and that this differentiation is induced in the absence of detectable levels of MHC class II antigens on the epithelial component in most cases. The role of the MHC class II antigens cannot be excluded, however, because these antigens were always present on macrophages. Analysis of the selected group of thymomas, each of which contained epithelial cells homogeneously stained by at least one of the described monoclonal antibodies, showed that the cortical type T cell inducer capacity of thymomas is independent of the epithelial type predominant in the tumor.\r"

  ".W": "Human B cells can be activated with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to surface IgM receptors or mAb to a 35-kilodalton B cell differentiation antigen, Bp35 (CD20). We compared anti-Ig-induced B cell activation with B cell triggering by anti-Bp35. Both anti-Ig- and anti-Bp35-dependent proliferation were augmented by the same co-stimulants, including a partially purified BCGF, recombinant IL 1, TPA, or each other. When anti-Bp35 and anti-Ig were used together to induce proliferation of tonsillar B cells, the strongest response was observed when anti-Bp35 was added 12 to 24 hr before anti-Ig. Anti-Bp35 also was found to act most effectively when added before the BCGF. Blood and tonsillar B cells differed in their proliferative response to anti-Ig or anti-Bp35: unlike dense tonsillar B cells, which consistently proliferated in response to either stimulus, blood B cells from many donors proliferated in response to anti-Ig but not to anti-Bp35 even in the presence of other co-stimuli. Dense tonsillar B cells that proliferate in response to anti-Bp35 appeared to be at a more activated stage than unresponsive blood B cells because they expressed higher levels of HLA class II molecules than blood B cells. Pretreatment of blood B cells with anti-Bp35 converted them to an HLA-DR(bri) phenotype and made them more responsive to anti-Ig-induced proliferation. These results suggest that B cells at different stages of differentiation differ in their response to anti-Bp35 and anti-Ig. The Bp35 surface polypeptide may play an early role in the activation of B cells prior to antigen or other signals.\r"

Furthermore, consistent associations between qualitative differences in IC and disease manifestations have been elusive. IC interaction with erythrocytes and mononuclear phagocytic cells is another variable in SLE that may also mediate some of the biological effects of IC. The present report concerns studies of the composition of purified IC obtained from individuals with SLE and other rheumatic diseases; a 64,000 dalton component identified as the A-B subunit of C1q was detected in purified IC from 27 of 51 SLE patients (53%). The presence of this 64,000 dalton component was not related to either IC concentration or to the serum C1q level. However, the presence of the C1q component in isolated SLE IC did correlate with the presence of renal disease (p less than 0.02). These observations are interpreted relative to a recently described kinetic model of IC clearance.\r"

  ".W": "Histopathology in testes from mice with actively induced experimental orchitis (EAO) (active EAO) and those from recipients of testis-sensitized lymphocytes (passive EAO) had different distributions. In passive EAO, maximum orchitis existed in the straight tubules, rete testis, and ductus efferentes, obstruction of which led to extreme dilatation of seminiferous tubules. Unusual intralymphatic granulomata also resulted in dilated testicular lymphatics. In active EAO, maximum orchitis affected seminiferous tubules under the testicular capsule, away from the rete testes. Vasitis was common and occurred in both active and passive EAO. In normal testes, IA+ F4/80+ cells were sparse but formed a cuff around the straight tubules. After immunization with testis in adjuvant or with adjuvant alone, the number, size, and staining intensity of IA+ cells increased dramatically beginning on day 5, 7 days before disease onset. Simultaneously, epithelial cells confined to the ductus efferentes became Ia+. Although recipients of sensitized lymphocytes also developed epithelial Ia in the ductus efferentes, they did not show changes in testicular interstitial Ia+ cells. Our findings indicate that testicular autoantigens are not completely sequestered, but are accessible to and can react with passively transferred immune lymphocytes in well-defined regions of the germ cell compartment. These regions coincided to a large extent with maximum expression of periductal or epithelial Ia. Changes in Ia+ cells in the testis, which are inducible by adjuvants and precede orchitis, may account in part for the different distribution of histopathology of active EAO.\r"

Unlike immature B cells from DBA/2 mice (which are tolerized by encounter with TNP-OVA), SIg- B cells from NZB mice respond to TNP-KLH with equal precursor frequency in TNP-OVA-tolerized or control fragments. In additional experiments, SIg- bone marrow or mature spleen cells of DBA/2 or NZB origin were adoptively transferred into irradiated (DBA/2 X NZB) F1 X xid hosts, and host-derived splenic fragments were stimulated in vitro with LPS and growth factors. These experiments revealed a substantial anti-ssDNA precursor frequency in NZB marrow and spleen (2.5 and 5.1, respectively, per 10(7) transferred cells). In DBA/2 SIg- marrow cells, there was an anti-ssDNA precursor frequency of 1.3 to 3.5/10(7) transferred cells; however, anti-ssDNA-producing clones were reduced in fragments derived from recipients of DBA/2 as compared with NZB spleen cells (0.2 to 1.9/10(7) transferred cells). By using a replica plate technique, we evaluated fragments from recipients of DBA/2 SIg- marrow cells or mature spleen cells for anti-TNP reactivity. In fragments derived from recipients of DBA/2 SIg- marrow cells, 92% of anti-TNP-producing fragments also bound ssDNA. In fragments derived from recipients of DBA/2 spleen cells, only 43% of anti-TNP-producing fragments also bound ssDNA. Our findings document that NZB marrow-derived immature B cells abnormally resist tolerance induction, and that clonal anergy/selection operates in directing the B cell repertoire away from autoantibody formation.\r"

  ".W": "We recently described a 50,000 dalton polypeptide Bp50 (CDw40) that is expressed on human B cells and plays a role in regulating B cell proliferation. Here we additionally characterize the functional signal given by antibody binding to Bp50 on both normal and malignant B cells. A monoclonal anti-Bp50 antibody could augment the proliferation of B cells activated by anti-IgM, anti-CD20, or 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulation, but was not co-stimulatory with B cell growth factor (BCGF), interleukin 1, or interleukin 2. The signal did not depend on the Fc portion of the antibody, because F(ab')2 fragments of anti-Bp50 were still functionally active. Both anti-Bp50 and a low m.w. BCGF preparation were similar in that both were co-stimulatory with the same agents and both anti-Bp50 and BCGF affected activated B cells but not resting B cells. However, a panel of B cell malignancies differed in their responsiveness to anti-Bp50 vs BCGF: some tumors proliferated in response to anti-Bp50 but not BCGF, whereas other tumors had the opposite pattern. Bp50 was found to have several properties in common with HLA class II molecules: both Bp50 and class II were expressed at lower levels on blood B cells than on tonsillar B cells; the expression of both Bp50 and class II was increased after activation of blood B cells with TPA or anti-IgM; and the expression of both Bp50 and class II was increased after activation of non T, non-B acute leukemias with BCGF. Thus class II and Bp50 expression may be under common regulatory control. The fact that BCGF modulated the expression of Bp50 on leukemic cells suggests that BCGF and Bp50-mediated signals may be coordinately regulated.\r"

  ".W": "Hybridomas were prepared from the spleen of a BALB/c mouse immunized with EL-4 T lymphoma cells. One, designated A1, was found to secrete a monoclonal antibody that reacted with two T lymphoma cells of C57BL origin, EL-4 and C6VLB, but not with normal C57BL/6 splenocytes or thymocytes, C57BL/6 T cell clones, or other T or B lymphomas by complement-mediated cytotoxicity or indirect immunofluorescent staining. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) A1 precipitated a protein that migrated at 85 kD under nonreducing and 43 kD under reducing conditions. The fact that the antigen defined by MAb A1 was a disulfide-linked dimer, together with the essentially clone-specific distribution of the reactive epitope, raised the possibility that the antibody defined an epitope of the antigen receptor. However, several additional observations revealed that the antibody defined a distinct and novel T cell surface structure. MAb 124-40, previously shown to react with the antigen receptor of C6VLB cells, reacted with variants of C6VLB that failed to express the A1 epitope. Sequential immunoprecipitation indicated that MAb A1 and MAb 124-40 reacted with distinct molecular species on C6VLB cells. Endoglycosidase digestion showed that the structure reactive with MAb A1 was not derived from that reactive with MAb 124-40 by addition of N-linked oligosaccharide residues. Two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of precipitates obtained from radioiodinated C6VLB cells with MAb 124-40 resolved the alpha and beta subunits of the antigen receptor. Similar analysis of precipitates obtained with MAb A1 revealed only a single basic chain under reducing conditions, although anomalous mobility suggestive of a second, more acidic chain was observed under nonreducing conditions. Two-dimensional maps of tyrosine-containing chymotryptic peptides of the proteins isolated with MAb A1 and MAb 124-40 were completely different, suggesting that the molecules shared no peptides and were distinct in primary structure. Finally, cross-linking studies performed with a cleavable reagent indicated that the A1 molecule, unlike the antigen receptor defined with MAb 124-40, was not associated with additional, T3-like structures on the surface of C6VLB cells. Although the MAb A1 was unreactive with normal cells in cytotoxicity or staining assays, a molecule of the appropriate size was immunoprecipitated in small amounts from lysates of radioiodinated normal spleen and thymus cells. These data indicate that MAb A1 defines a novel disulfide-linked T cell surface molecule distinct from the antigen receptor.\r"

The two forms of antigen, native (nBSA) and cationized (cBSA), cross-react at the level of the B cell, as evidenced by the ability of antibody raised against one form to react with the other and by inhibition assays using ELISA. T cell cross-reactivity was also observed in proliferation assays, but the amount of cBSA required for stimulation was 500 times less than the amount of native protein needed. In vivo, cBSA produced responses which, at their optimal levels, were at least double the response to nBSA and which showed a different kinetic pattern, peaking later and lasting longer than the response to the native molecule. Moreover, antibodies were produced in response to administration of cBSA but not nBSA when given i.v. in saline, without an adjuvant. Although a mechanism for these phenomena is not yet clear, we speculate that the cBSA may have a greater affinity for antigen-presenting cells or for the T cell receptor, or that the altered structure may enhance recognition of the molecule by APC and/or helper T cells.\r"

In the present paper, the kinetics of activation are shown to be biphasic; that is, a portion of the C1 is activated very rapidly, and the remainder slowly. These two processes can be separated by the order of mixing of preincubated components; thus, only the rapid activation rate is observed if C1q and the monoclonal antibody are preincubated together and are added subsequently to a mixture of C1r2C1S2 and C1-inhibitor. Only the slow activation rate is observed when C1q, C1r2C1S2, and C1-inhibitor are preincubated and are added subsequently to monoclonal antibody 1H11. Similar results are obtained by using either the intact 1H11 antibody or else the (Fab)2 obtained from it by proteolytic digestion and purification. The rapid phase is independent of the concentration of 1H11 over the range employed; the slow phase depends on 1H11 concentration. Plausible activation schemes are presented to explain the two distinct activation rate processes, and kinetic models are developed which provide a reasonable simulation of the experimental data.\r"

Northern blot analysis of total hepatic RNA revealed differences in C2, factor B, and C3 mRNA levels in strains that share B10 background but differ in the H-2 region (e.g., H-2k, H-2u, H-2d, H-2f). In each instance, hepatic mRNA specific for the individual gene product corresponded in amount to the serum levels. By contrast, specific mRNA content of C2 and factor B in macrophages differed significantly from those observed in liver for each strain. Modulation of C2, factor B, and C3 expression was studied after in vivo administration of recombinant IL 1 or endotoxin to H-2k (B10.AKM) or H-2u (B10.PL) strain mice. As assessed by Northern blot analysis, neither endotoxin nor IL 1 affected liver C2-specific mRNA but increased specific C2 mRNA levels in kidney and lung. For both strains, IL 1 increased specific factor B mRNA in all tissues examined except for the H-2u strain liver factor B mRNA content, which was not affected by IL 1, whereas that of H-2k mice was increased. The lack of factor B modulation by IL 1 in the H-2u lines was specific to that gene and not a reflection of a generalized IL 1 unresponsiveness. Differences in tissue and strain specific constitutive and IL 1-regulated expression of the C3 gene were also observed in the H-2u and H-2k strains.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-linking of membrane IgM (mIgM) on both normal resting B cells and on the murine B cell lymphoma WEHI-231 activates the phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway. The initial event in this pathway is the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2), which results in the generation of two second-messengers: inositol trisphosphate (InsP3), which can cause the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and diacylglycerol (DG), which activates protein kinase C. In examining the effects of exogenous activation of protein kinase C on WEHI-231 cells, we found that phorbol esters blocked some of the biologic effects of anti-IgM on WEHI-231 cells. The mechanism of this effect was investigated. Phorbol ester treatment of WEHI-231 cells blocked the ability of anti-IgM to stimulate production of inositol phosphates and accumulation of phosphatidic acid, the phosphorylated product of DG. Phorbol esters also blocked the ability of anti-IgM to cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+. Thus, it is clear that phorbol esters block anti-IgM-stimulated PtdInsP2 hydrolysis in WEHI-231 cells. In addition, a synthetic DG, dioctanoylglycerol (diC8), also blocked anti-IgM-stimulated inositol phosphate production and the anti-IgM-stimulated rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+. The ability of phorbol esters and diC8 to block mIgM-mediated signaling may reflect a feedback inhibition mechanism by which activated protein kinase C limits the magnitude and duration of receptor signaling.\r"

In this paper, we describe the effects on natural killer (NK) activity of a synthetic peptide (CKS-17) with homology to a region of p15E conserved among numerous retroviruses. Enriched human NK cells were assayed against K562 tumor target cells in a 51Cr-release cytotoxicity assay. Pretreatment of NK cells with CKS-17 at concentrations as low as 1.5 microM, but not with equivalent concentrations of control materials, markedly and reproducibly suppressed NK lytic activity. Prior exposure of NK cells to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) at 1000 U/ml did not alter their sensitivity to CKS-17-induced inhibition. Pretreating NK cells with CKS-17 almost entirely diminished their responsiveness to IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma, but not to interleukin 2 (IL 2). Kinetics experiments demonstrated that CKS-17-mediated suppression of both endogenous and activated NK cells was reversible after 18 hr at 37 degrees C. Experiments designed to examine the CKS-17 mechanism of action revealed that the peptide bound to all Leu-11+ lymphocytes, as shown by two-color flow cytometry. CKS-17 did not, however, inhibit effector cell/target cell conjugate formation. These data suggest a new mechanism for immune suppression mediated by retroviruses; inhibition of NK function. They moreover imply that the CKS-17 peptide interferes with the lytic phase of NK cytolysis.\r"

Macrophage cytotoxicity against this cell but not against the TNF-resistant P815 mastocytoma, was completely inhibitable by a specific anti-TNF serum also in the absence of measurable secreted TNF. Moreover the TNF-dependent lysis of tumor cells could also be performed by activated macrophages that had been fixed with paraformaldehyde before the addition of the target cells. In the indirect radioimmunoassay, TNF could be demonstrated on the surface of fixed effector cells. Our results must be interpreted in terms of membrane-associated TNF as the lytic principle for TNF-susceptible tumor cells.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the reactions of a panel of nine monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies with the surface immunoglobulin in situ on guinea pig L2C leukemic lymphocytes. Equilibrium binding constants were shown to range between 10(7) and 10(8) M-1 for univalent Fab' gamma fragments and between 10(8) and 10(9) M-1 for intact IgG. Saturation of the cell surface binding sites was achieved with 2.9 X 10(5) Fab' gamma molecules/cell and 1.2 X 10(5) IgG molecules/cell for each antibody, a result that is consistent with a bivalent mode of interaction for the IgG. Despite these overall similarities in binding characteristics antibodies showed striking differences in their ability to clear Ig from the cell surface by antigenic modulation in vitro. This suggested differences in the readiness with which the antibodies cross-linked neighboring surface Ig molecules. Such an interpretation was supported by differences in the times required to achieve bivalent binding at 0 degree C, and in the rates at which labeled antibody dissociated from the cell surface in the presence or absence of an excess of unlabeled antibody. The data are consistent with there being two functionally distinct types of anti-idiotype antibody: those that form predominantly intra-Ig bridges, with each antibody Fab being linked to an Fab on one target molecule (\"monogamous\" binding) and not favoring modulation; and those that form predominantly inter-Ig bridges (\"bigamous\" binding) and favor modulation. The nature of interaction is presumably dictated by the orientation of the particular idiotope concerned. This distinction could be of great importance in the therapeutic use of anti-idiotype to ablate B cell neoplasms.\r"

It appears that LPC that invade the fetal mouse thymus between 10 and 13 days rapidly differentiate into Thy-1 positive thymocytes, giving rise to all of the lymphoid populations of both cortical and medullary locations until approximately the end of the first week after birth. Lymphoid precursor cells that enter the fetal thymus after 13 days of fetal life only differentiate into Thy-1 positive lymphocytes 6 or 7 days after birth, when they give rise to a second generation of thymocytes that grows exponentially and completely replaces the first generation in approximately 8 days. All cells leaving the thymus during the first 2 wk of life appear to be derived from the first wave of precursors.\r"

  ".W": "Specific resistance to local graft vs host reaction (GvHR) observed in F1 hybrids pretreated s.c., i.p., or i.v. with parent strain spleen cells has been explained as being due to cytotoxic cells induced in these pretreated F1 hybrids and directed against cells bearing receptors that recognize the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alloantigens of the opposite parent strain (anti-receptor anti-MHC cytotoxic T lymphocytes; CTL). These anti-receptor anti-MHC CTL, however, have never been detected directly in popliteal lymph nodes (PLN), which develop a specific resistance to GvHR. In this paper, we describe the detection of anti-receptor anti-D2 cytotoxic activity in both right and left PLN of B6D2F1 hybrids injected s.c. in the right footpad only with B6 spleen cells. This cytotoxic activity appears 4 days after the injection of B6 cells and diminishes by day 7. It is mediated by a Thy-1+, L3T4-, Lyt-2+ cell of B6D2F1 origin and induced by the injection of either Thy-1+L3T4+Lyt-2- or Thy-1+L3T4-Lyt-2+ B6 spleen cells. The anti-receptor anti-D2 CTL activity is not observed in PLN of B6D2F1 hybrids pretreated i.p. or i.v. with B6 spleen cells. Our results demonstrate that anti-receptor anti-MHC CTL can fully explain the specific resistance to GvHR induced by the s.c. pretreatment of F1 hybrids with parent strain spleen cells. Their role, however, in the resistance to GvHR observed in F1 hybrids i.v. or i.p. pretreated is far from being entirely proven.\r"

One of 50 to one of 200 nylon wool-nonadherent (FACS-purified), small Lyt-2+ spleen cells of B6 origin gave rise in vitro to a cytotoxic T lymphocyte clone that specifically lysed targets bearing bm1 alloantigen. This population of alloantigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte precursors (CLP) was activated by different types of bm1 stimulator cells with different efficiency: 2 X 10(5) nonfractionated spleen cells, 5000 normal peritoneal cells, 400 to 10(4) L3T4+ helper T blasts, or 2000 to 10(4) Lyt-2+ T blasts induced clonal growth of this CLP pool. Irradiated or mitomycin-treated small (L3T4+ or Lyt-2+) bm1-derived T cells were inefficient stimulator cells for this response. Supplementation of culture medium with (recombinant) interleukin 2 was necessary and sufficient to support clonal development of alloantigen-triggered CLP in the presence of allogeneic T blasts. Under these limiting dilution conditions, we observed comparable cloning efficiencies for (wild-type) Kb-allospecific splenic Lyt-2+ CLP from bm1 mice generated in response to either irradiated B6 spleen cells or inactivated B6-derived T cell lines (EL4 and RBL-5 lymphoma cells). The data indicate that normal T lymphoblasts as well as tumor T cell lines stimulate clonal development in vitro of class I H-2-allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the presence of interleukin 2.\r"

  ".W": "An assay was developed to monitor early activation of single fluorescein-specific B cells obtained from the spleens of nonimmunized adult mice by prefractionation on hapten gelatin. Early activation was assessed as a significant increase in the diameter of individual B cells after 24 hr in vitro. Significant enlargement of the single B cells was induced within 24 hr by either T-independent antigens acting alone or a crude source of B cell growth and differentiation factors (EL-BGDF-pik) acting alone. In contrast, T-dependent antigens acting alone were ineffective. When selected T-independent antigens and EL-BGDF-pik acted together, a greater number of B cells were induced to enlarge. B cell stimulatory factor 1 (BSF 1) behaved in a similar manner as EL-BGDF-pik, inducing early B cell enlargement both in the absence and more so in the presence of antigen. Both EL-BGDF-pik and BSF 1 enhanced the survival of single hapten-specific B cells during the 24-hr period. Interleukin 1 was unable to cause B cell enlargement when acting alone, although it was able to augment B cell enlargement induced by antigen. Interleukin 2 did not induce cell enlargement in either the presence or absence of antigen. Activation was demonstrated among cells of all sizes, regardless of the stimulus, although a greater response was demonstrated amongst the larger cell population. The addition of 3T3 filler cells enhanced early B cell activation and cell survival during the 24-hr period. The 24-hr B cell enlargement assay as applied to isolated single cells provides an unequivocal approach to the analysis of early B cell activation, adding a further parameter for the dissection of the precise roles of antigen and the various factors in the B cell differentiation pathway.\r"

The nature of the protective immune response against this virus is currently unknown. We report here results using an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay which has been developed for measuring a specific immune response against HTLV-III/LAV. Forty-four sera were examined for their ability to mediate ADCC against HTLV-III/LAV-infected T cells. Sera from healthy HTLV-III/LAV seropositive individuals in the presence of mononuclear cells from healthy HTLV-III/LAV seronegative donors exhibited significantly higher levels of ADCC activity compared to sera from patients with AIDS. Western blot analysis of serum samples indicated that antibody reactivity with the p24 protein of HTLV-III/LAV correlated with higher levels of ADCC activity than did reactivity with Gp120/160. The observation that sera from healthy HTLV-III/LAV seropositive individuals mediated higher levels of ADCC activity than did sera obtained from subjects with AIDS suggests that ADCC may represent a protective immune response to infection with HTLV-III/LAV.\r"

PGE2 significantly inhibited both responses, whereas PGF2 alpha had no inhibitory effect. Responses of highly purified B cells obtained from spleen, lymph node, and tonsil were also inhibited. In addition PGE2 suppressed B cell responses supported by recombinant interleukin 2 rather than T cell supernatant. PGE2-mediated inhibition was mimicked by forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase. Kinetic studies indicated that PGE2 inhibited B cell responses by a progressively greater increment as cultures were prolonged. Evaluation by flow cytometry after staining with acridine orange or mithramycin indicated that PGE2 had no effect on initial B cell entry into the G1 phase of the cell cycle, passage through G1, and entry into S, G2, and M. Rather, PGE2 inhibited responses of postdivisional daughter cells. PGE2 inhibited responses in cultures stimulated by the calcium ionophore ionomycin and T cell supernatant but had minimal effects in cultures stimulated by the combination of ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate. Moreover, phorbol myristate acetate reversed PGE2-mediated inhibition of proliferation stimulated by S. aureus or S. aureus + T cell supernatant. These results indicate that PGE2 suppresses the continued growth and differentiation of human B cells, although it has no effect on initial B cell activation and suggest that PGE2 may play a role in regulating human B cell responses in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The production of B lymphocytes and myeloid cells occurs in the bone marrow in association with a supporting population of stromal cells. To determine whether these processes are dependent upon the same or different populations of stromal cells, stromal cell lines were generated from the adherent layer of a Dexter type long-term bone marrow culture. These cultures support myeloid cells and their precursors, a B cell precursor, and the adherent layer cells with support B cell differentiation under appropriate conditions. Two of the lines examined, S10 and S17, express class I histocompatibility antigens but not other hemopoietic cell surface determinants such as Thy-1, Lyt-1, Ig, Ia, Mac-1, or BP-1. Both lines could support myelopoiesis under Dexter conditions upon seeding with nylon wool-passed bone marrow. The nylon wool passage depletes stromal cells capable of forming adherent layers in vitro but retains hemopoietic precursors. The number of cells and colony-forming units-granulocytes/macrophages in the nonadherent cell population recovered 3 wk post-seeding had increased 19-fold and 10-fold, respectively, in the reseeded cultures of S10 and S17. After 3 wk of growth in Dexter conditions, the reseeded cultures were transferred to conditions optimal for B cell differentiation described by Whitlock and Witte. After 4 wk of growth, hemopoietic cells were consistently recovered from S17 cultures but not those of S10. A proportion of these cells from S17 cultures expressed the 14.8 antigen and were surface IgM positive. Surviving hemopoietic cells present in cultures of S10 were primarily macrophages. These findings indicate that S17 but not S10 can support both myelopoiesis and B lymphopoiesis and suggest that one stromal cell population has the capacity to form a hemopoietic microenvironment for both lineages.\r"

These antisera reacted to varying degrees with native biologically active IL 3. Antibodies directed against peptides corresponding to residues 1-29 at the NH2 terminus, 123-140 at the COOH terminus, and to residues 64-82 and 91-112 were affinity-purified on peptide columns. Immunoabsorbent columns produced from affinity-purified antibodies to the 1-29, 91-112, and 123-140 although not the 64-82 peptide were effective in depleting biologically active IL 3 from conditioned medium. However, the antibodies specific for peptides 91-112 and 123-140 had only a low affinity for native IL 3 and it was only in the case of the anti-1-29 antibodies that a significant amount of IL 3 remained bound after extensive washing and could be recovered from the column by acid elution. The affinity-purified antibodies directed to peptides 1-29, 91-112, and 123-140 significantly inhibited the biological activity of IL 3, although with different dose-response characteristics. Anti-1-29 antibodies inhibited bioactivity over a wide range of concentrations (down to 20 ng/ml) although the inhibition was never complete. In contrast, the anti-91-112 antibodies, although effective only at high concentrations, produced complete inhibition of biological activity. These experiments demonstrated that antibodies to defined peptides can be used to generate antibodies to native IL 3 and should form useful tools in analyzing the structure and function of the native molecules.\r"

Affinity-purified antibody preparations specific for epitopes determined by residues 1 to 6 were immobilized and used as affinity columns. Up to 98% of IL 3 bioactivity in T cell-conditioned medium was depleted by these columns, as was 71 and 74%, respectively, of IL 3 aberrantly produced by the myeloid leukemias WEHI-274.14 and WEHI-3B. IL 3 produced in vivo in WEHI-3B tumor-bearing mice also bound to the anti-1-6 antibody column, up to 70% of the bioactivity being depleted from ascites fluid and up to 84% from the serum. These results suggest that all IL 3 secreted by T cells and the majority of the IL 3 molecules secreted by myeloid leukemias express epitopes determined by residues 1-6 and cannot have the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence initially reported for IL 3. These six NH2-terminal amino acids share similarities with the NH2-terminal amino acids of several other lymphokines, suggesting an important function for this hexapeptide.\r"

Although several potential sites of action have been identified, the mechanisms whereby CsA mediates its immunosuppressive properties have not been fully delineated. We have examined the effects of the immunosuppressive cyclosporins, CsA, dihydrocyclosporin D, and cyclosporin G, and a nonimmunosuppressive analog, cyclosporin H, on early events associated with activation of human T cells. Interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptor expression, as measured by immunofluorescence, was unaffected by CsA. Despite this, in the continuous presence of CsA, exogenous IL 2 did not bypass CsA inhibition of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced proliferation. Thus, one site of activity of CsA is on IL 2-induced proliferation of IL 2 receptor-expressing cells. In addition, several potential mechanisms for inhibiting IL 2 secretion were identified. Changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), an obligatory event for PHA-induced IL 2 secretion, were inhibited by a 30-min preincubation with the immunosuppressive cyclosporins but not the inactive analog. In this action, the drug effects cannot be distinguished from that of Ca2+ channel blockers. The active compounds also resulted in membrane depolarization, an effect which may, in part, explain the reduction in PHA-induced changes in [Ca2+]i. These results identify multiple sites of action of the immunosuppressive cyclosporins, the combination of which likely accounts for their selective inhibition of T cell function in vitro and in vivo.\r"

Under assay conditions of T' cell excess, the efficiency of triggering is a function of the target cell type. When various H-2k-bearing target cells were used to trigger B10.AQR T' cells activated against B10.A cells (anti-Kk), a hierarchy of triggering efficiency was observed with B10.A Con A blasts greater than R1.1 tumor cells greater than B10.A spleen cells greater than B10.A lymph node cells. There was a 10-fold difference in triggering efficiency between Con A blasts and lymph node cells. A similar pattern of reactivity was observed for various H-2d-bearing target cells used to trigger CBA T' cells specific for BALB/c antigens (anti-H-2d). Under assay conditions of T' cell excess, the order of reaction, i.e., the number of target cells per T' cell required to trigger lymphokine release, remained constant for the different target cell types. However, the order of reaction can vary with conditions of T cell activation. CBA T' cells activated against BALB/c spleen cells exhibited pseudo-first-order reactivity when triggered for lymphokine release with P815 target cells, whereas CBA T' cells activated against UV-irradiated P815 cells exhibited pseudo-second-order reactivity when triggered by the same tumor cells. Thus, T cells with the same apparent specificity can be qualitatively different in their reactivity with antigen. Under assay conditions of target cell excess, our analysis indicated that no T-T interaction was involved in the triggering reaction. Finally, our analysis was applied to study the nature of cross-reactivity. The results indicated that the triggering of lymphokine elicited by a cross-reactive antigen was due to the reactivity of a discrete subset of T' cells.\r"

The virally induced C3 receptor(s) has been broadly defined as a C3b receptor, but its ligand binding characteristics have not been rigorously defined. In this study, human epidermal cells, A431 cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells infected with HSV-1 demonstrated rosetting with sheep erythrocytes (E) coated with IgG (E-IgG) or the complement components C3b (EAC3b) or iC3b (EAC3bi), but not with E-IgM, C4 (EAC14), C3d (EAC3d), or E alone. Rosetting was markedly enhanced by pretreatment of HSV-1-infected cells with neuraminidase. Unlike human C3 receptors, the HSV-1-induced C3 receptor was found to be trypsin resistant. To determine whether HSV-1 induced CR1-like receptors or CR3-like receptors, infected cells were pretreated with EDTA, which is known to inhibit native CR3 function. EDTA failed to prevent rosetting with EAC3bi. Furthermore, blocking studies using monoclonal antibodies against CR1 and CR3 revealed that the anti-CR1 antibody 5C11 consistently blocked EAC3b and EAC3bi rosetting with HSV-1-infected cells in a dose dependent manner, but monoclonal antibodies against CR3 did not. This study indicates that the HSV-1-induced C3 receptor is an analogue of CR1.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the interaction of C1q, a subunit of the first component of complement, with human monocytes and culture-derived macrophages. Adherence of these mononuclear phagocytes to surfaces coated with C1q induced a marked enhancement of the phagocytosis of sheep erythrocytes opsonized with IgG anti-Forssman antibody (EA-IgG). This C1q-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis was dose dependent, and was specifically blocked by pretreatment of the C1q-coated surfaces with F(ab')2 anti-C1q. The augmentation of FcR-mediated phagocytosis by C1q was determined to be a result of the interaction between the C1q and the phagocytic effector cell, and was not due to interaction between the surface-bound C1q and the EA-IgG. Neither resting nor N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-stimulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes were induced by C1q to increase FcR-mediated phagocytosis. Experiments conducted with purified fragments of C1q suggest that the C1q phagocytosis enhancement signal resides in the collagen-like tail domain of the molecule. This region is the same portion of the molecule previously shown to interact with the cell surface C1q receptor. Native type I collagen was unable to enhance FcR-mediated phagocytosis by mononuclear phagocytes. It has been demonstrated that C1q can be localized to areas of inflammation, and additionally C1q can be secreted by macrophages in culture. In view of these findings and the results of our present study, we hypothesize that C1q could provide local, direct, and non-opsonic enhancement of phagocytosis by mononuclear phagocytes in areas of infection and inflammation.\r"

This anti-idiotypic reagent bound to rat liver membranes bearing AII receptors; binding was abolished after pretreatment of the membranes with AII. In immunoblotting experiments with rat liver membranes, as well as with rat pituitary homogenates, a 63,000 +/- 2,000 dalton protein was revealed that co-migrated with the AII receptor. After purification by affinity chromatography on an immobilized CRI+-antibody (A41), anti-CRI antibodies could immunoprecipitate the hormone binding activity from detergent-treated rat liver membranes and still recognize the 63,000 dalton protein. In contrast, anti-idiotypic antibodies specific for the private idiotope failed to interact with the AII receptor. Similar results were obtained with a second anti-idiotypic serum produced by immunization with another CRI+ anti-AII monoclonal antibody (A22). The sharing of the CRI determinant between the AII receptor and anti-AII antibodies might account for the reactivity of anti-idiotypic antibodies towards the AII receptor.\r"

Anti-idiotypic IgG and Fab both inhibited the binding of [3H]LTB4, but not [3H]N-formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP), to PMN leukocytes with similar concentration-effect relationships, whereas neither nonimmune rabbit IgG nor Fab had any inhibitory activity. At a concentration of anti-idiotypic IgG that inhibited by 50% the binding of [3H] LTB4 to PMN leukocytes, the antibodies preferentially recognized high affinity receptors. Anti-idiotypic IgG and Fab inhibited PMN leukocyte chemotactic responses to LTB4, but not fMLP, with concentration-effect relationships resembling those characteristic of the inhibition of binding of [3H] LTB4, without altering the LTB4-induced release of beta-glucuronidase. Chemotaxis and increases in the cytoplasmic concentration of calcium equal in magnitude to those elicited by optimal concentrations of LTB4 were attained at respective concentrations of anti-idiotypic IgG equal to and 1/25 the level required for inhibition of binding of [3H]LTB4 by approximately 50%. Thus, the anti-idiotypic antibodies bound to PMN leukocyte receptors for LTB4 with a specificity, preference for high affinity sites, and capacity to alter PMN leukocyte functions that were similar to LTB4.\r"

  ".W": "The susceptibility of mouse cells expressing full-length or truncated transforming protein (T antigen) of simian virus 40 (SV40) to lysis by murine natural killer (NK) cells was assessed. For these studies, C57BL/6 mouse embryo fibroblasts (B6/MEF) were transformed by transfection with SV40 DNA encoding the entire T antigen. The transformed cell lines were tested for susceptibility to lysis by nonimmune CBA splenocytes as a source of NK cells and to lysis by C57BL/6, SV40-specific cytolytic T cells (CTL). It was found that 13 of 15 clonally derived, SV40-transformed H-2b cell lines were susceptible to lysis by NK cells. However, there was some variation in their susceptibility to lysis by NK cells. There was no correlation between susceptibility to lysis by SV40-specific CTL and to lysis by NK cells. Cells transfected with a plasmid which encodes only the N-terminal half of the SV40 T antigen were consistently less susceptible to lysis by NK cells, suggesting that expression of only the N-terminus of the T antigen was insufficient for optimal susceptibility to lysis by NK cells. Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts transformed by human adenovirus type 5 E1 region DNA were also found to be susceptible to NK cell-mediated lysis. Lysis of SV40-transformed cells by nonimmune CBA splenocytes was mediated by NK cells because: lysis was augmented when the effector cells were treated with interferon before assay; and lysis was abrogated when the effector cells were obtained from mice that had been depleted of NK activity by treatment with antiserum against the asialo GM1 surface marker. These results indicate that primary mouse cells which are transformed by SV40 and which express the native T antigen are susceptible to lysis by mouse NK cells. Conversely, cells transformed by a plasmid encoding only the N-terminal half of the T antigen express reduced susceptibility to lysis by NK cells.\r"

We examined a possible role for Clq in eosinophil-mediated cytotoxicity by using a Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula killing system in vitro. The addition of monomeric purified human Clq enhanced IgG-dependent human eosinophil-mediated killing from 1.4-fold to 2.3-fold (mean percent killing 12% +/- 4 vs 21% +/- 4, p less than 0.005) when the immune IgG concentration was low. In contrast, there was no significant enhancement of neutrophil-mediated killing. When the IgG concentration was increased fourfold Clq did not cause enhancement of eosinophil-mediated killing (35% +/- 9 vs 37% +/- 5). Preincubation of eosinophils with type 1 collagen abrogated Clq enhancement of killing, raising the possibility of a receptor-mediated process, which depends upon cellular binding of Clq via the collagenous portion of the molecule. Eosinophils and neutrophils were examined for the presence of Clq receptors by using 125I labeled Clq. Clq binding to both cell types was saturable, reversible, and specific, indicating that binding is through specific receptors. Type 1 collagen inhibited binding of Clq to cells, suggesting that Clq binding is via the collagenous stalk of Clq. The number of receptors was approximately twice as high for eosinophils as compared with neutrophils (1.9 X 10(7) vs 1.1 X 10(7), p less than 0.025). Affinity constants for the two cell types were similar (1.5 X 10(7) vs 1.3 X 10(7). These findings suggest that Clq and receptors for Clq on eosinophils may be important for eosinophil-mediated schistosomula killing.\r"

Tumor immunity could be established only if the Id protein was conjugated to a strongly immunogenic carrier protein such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin or thyroglobulin, and if the conjugate was administered at least 1 week prior to tumor challenge. Free Id protein, such as that present in tumor bearing animals, was found to inhibit tumor immunity in a dose-dependent manner. Although tumor immunity could be induced in animals with pre-existent serum Id protein, the expression of the immune state was inhibited by the presence of the soluble protein.\r"

During organ culture a population of immature thymocytes expressing low levels of receptors developed first, and then diminished as mature thymocytes with high levels of receptor expression appeared. Continuous culture with antireceptor antibody modulated receptor from the surfaces of immature thymocytes, but did not prevent their appearance or accumulation. By contrast, appearance of receptor-bearing mature thymocytes was prevented in the presence of antireceptor antibody. These results indicate that the receptor is not essential for the generation of immature thymocytes but is involved in the selection or maintenance of mature cells from this pool.\r"

  ".U": "87110692\r", 
  ".W": "The xid gene, which causes a B lymphocyte immune defect in CBA/N mice, has been bred onto the C3H/HeN background. The resulting X chromosome congenic mice (C3.CBA/N) exhibit immunologic defects that are much more profound than the defect exhibited by CBA/N mice; thus, the B cells from C3.CBA/N mice not only fail to respond to thymus-independent (TI) type 2 antigens such as TNP-Ficoll, but they fail to respond in vitro to TI-type 1 antigens such as TNP-Brucella abortus (BA) and B cell mitogens such as LPS and Nocardia water-soluble mitogen. In this paper we show that the synergistic defect seen in C3.CBA/N B cells is also elicited in adoptive transfer assays to thymus-dependent (TD) antigens such as TNP-KLH and PC-KLH, antigens to which both parental strains respond. Thus, the secondary adoptive transfer response of C3.CBA/N spleen cells is generally less than 5% of the immune response produced by CBA/N or C3H/HeN spleen cells. This synergistic defect is restricted to the C3.CBA/N B cells, since C3.CBA/N T cells can provide help to CBA/N B cells that is equivalent to the help obtained with CBA/N T cells. The low responsiveness of C3.CBA/N spleen cells to TD antigens, which is elicited in adoptive transfer assays, is not seen when the intact animal is immunized with antigen in CFA; this, intact C3.CBA/N mice produce anti-PC-KLH and anti-TNP-KLH responses only slightly lower than the responses of CBA/N mice to these same antigens. In contrast, when these mice are immunized with phenol-extracted LPS, a TI-type 1 antigen, their antibody responses are severely depressed. These data suggest that under conditions in which T cell help may be limiting or in which the intact physiology of the T and B cells has been disrupted, C3.CBA/N B cells demonstrate profound immunologic impairment; however, when adequate T cell help is available and the splenic architecture is not disrupted, their immune responses appear to progress in a normal fashion.\r"

Guinea pig LSLC were found to present antigen in vitro, albeit somewhat less effectively than a reference population of peritoneal exudate macrophages. The difference in APC function could not be explained by a deficiency of interleukin 1 (IL 1), as LSLC secreted IL 1 and expressed membrane-bound thymocyte stimulatory activity. The ability of LSLC to take up antigen from the portal blood in vivo and present it to primed T lymphocytes in vitro was also investigated. Trinitrophenyl-ovalbumin was injected intraportally into either strain 13 or strain 2 guinea pigs. The LSLC were subsequently isolated by collagenase digestion and density separation and assessed for the ability to induce proliferation of antigen-primed accessory cell-depleted syngeneic peritoneal exudate T lymphocytes in vitro. The in vivo antigen-pulsed LSLC were found to present antigen in vitro to primed T cells in an antigen-specific and genetically restricted manner. T cell DNA synthesis induced by antigen-bearing LSLC could be augmented by coculture with additional accessory cells, but not IL 1-containing macrophage supernatants. Enhancement of responsiveness was not genetically restricted. The demonstration that LSLC can take up, process, and retain antigen in vivo and present it to primed T cells in vitro suggests that LSLC are capable of contributing to the immune response to antigens appearing in portal blood.\r"

Although the regulatory role of various cell-derived factors has been examined, the involvement of the macrophage-derived factor, TNF, in human B cell growth and differentiation has not yet been investigated. In the present study we examine the role of rTNF in polyclonal B cell response of human PBL induced by PWM. The addition of rTNF at the initiation of the culture resulted in the dose-dependent inhibition of the generation of both IgG and IgM PFC. Inhibition of PFC development followed the same dose response as rTNF-mediated cytotoxicity against a TNF-sensitive tumor target. The mechanism of rTNF-mediated suppression was examined in different experimental systems. Recombinant TNF did not affect the viability or proliferation of either the T cell or B cell subpopulations, suggesting that TNF does not mediate its suppressive effect by cytotoxic mechanisms. Kinetic studies in which rTNF was added at different times after initiation of culture indicated that inhibition can be observed as late as 4 days of culture and suggested that TNF acts at a late phase of the growth and differentiation pathway of B cells. In further studies we examined the cellular level of TNF-mediated suppression. The addition of rTNF to supernatants containing helper factors and enriched B cells resulted in no inhibition, suggesting that TNF does not act at the B cell level. This was confirmed by demonstrating that rTNF does not inhibit spontaneous PFC development by the CESS B cell line. The effect of TNF on T cell subpopulations was examined by using normal or irradiated T cells, which inactivate suppressor cells. Addition of rTNF to B cells combined with either T cell population suppressed both IgG and IgM PFC development, indicating that the target cell for suppression is the T helper cell but not ruling out an effect on macrophages or the T suppressor cells. Combined, the observed results demonstrate that rTNF suppresses PWM-induced B cell differentiation without affecting B cell proliferation. TNF appears to mediate the suppression by acting directly on T helper cells or else by regulating the production of factors controlling T cell activation and lymphokine secretion.\r"

Cross-reactive idiotypes (Id) on monoclonal and polyclonal rheumatoid factors (RF) have been found frequently. Sufficient attention has not been directed, however, to the proportion of RF exhibiting the cross-reactivity, leaving the impression of extensive RF cross-reactivity when, in fact, this might represent a small minority of total RF molecules in a given individual. We have examined the polyclonal RF from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for cross-reactive Id in three different assays and with different Id-anti-Id systems. First, a sensitive liquid-phase radioimmunoassay was used in which panels of sera were tested for inhibition of different, idiotypically unrelated, Id-anti-Id interactions. When compared with normal sera, some of the sera from patients with RA caused minimal inhibition of Id-anti-Id interactions. None, however, caused marked inhibition of any Id-anti-Id system. Secondly, the panels of sera were also tested in a direct binding ELISA to detect partially cross-reactive Id that may not have been identified in the inhibition radioimmunoassay without differing results. Finally, results similar to the autologous Id-anti-Id inhibition assay were also found when the panels of RA sera were tested in two nonautologous Id-anti-Id systems, in which the anti-Id reacted with other than their own Id. These studies indicate that although cross-reactivity with some RF of an individual's total RF population may be seen frequently, an individual's repertoire of RF is itself private, quite diverse, and unique to that individual.\r"

  ".W": "In past experiments, using limited dilution analysis, we have demonstrated that a high percentage of immunoglobulin-secreting clones derived from Epstein-Barr virus- (EBV) stimulated lymphocytes secrete IgA. To further characterize the IgA produced by these clones, the IgA subclass of supernatants from clones stimulated 4 to 6 wk previously with EBV was determined by radioimmunoassay. All of 17 IgA-producing clones secreted IgA1; none secreted IgA2. Because we have shown that surface IgM+ (sIgM+) B cells are an enriched source of IgA2 plasma cell precursors, panning techniques were used to purify sIgM+ B cells from tonsils. Of 103 clones derived from these sIgM+ B cells, 102 secreted IgA1 and only one secreted IgA2. The relative absence of IgA2-producing clones could not be attributed to an absence of EBV receptors on IgA2 cells. A mean of 84 +/- 4% of freshly isolated IgA2 B cells and 78 +/- 6% of IgA1 B cells could be stained with a monoclonal antibody binding the EBV receptor; and there was no failure of EBV to infect IgA2 plasma cells precursors. Of IgA2 plasma cells derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated 7 days previously with EBV, 54 +/- 7% were positive for the EBV nuclear antigen, compared with 54 +/- 18% of IgA1 plasma cells from the same cultures. Seven days after EBV stimulation, a mean of 25% of the total IgA plasma cells were positive for cytoplasmic IgA2, whereas by 21 days after stimulation only 7% were positive for IgA2. This shift in the proportions of IgA1 and IgA2 plasma cells could be attributed to a failure of the IgA2 plasma cell number to increase after 10 days in culture. There was no evidence for selective suppression of IgA2 production by T cells or selective lysis of IgA2 plasma cells by infectious EBV particles. These results demonstrate that although precursors for both IgA1- and IgA2-producing cells can be stimulated to differentiate in response to EBV, there is preferential transformation of IgA1-producing cells.\r"

  ".W": "T and B cell responses to myelin basic protein (MBP) and its relevant peptide fragments were examined throughout the course of MBP-induced relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (REAE) in (SJL X PL)F1 mice. T cell reactivity, measured by the antigen-driven proliferation of lymph node T cells in vitro, was directed predominantly against the encephalitogenic MBP-P2 peptide (amino acids 1 to 37) at all stages of disease. Levels of responsiveness did not correlate with disease expression, but declined over time to a relapse level that was four- to sixfold lower than that observed during peak acute stage reactivity. Relapse responses were further distinguished by the detection of host I-E restrictions on Lyt-1+ T cell recognition of P2, P2 recognition by acute-stage T cells occurring solely in the context of host I-A molecules. These data imply an increase in the heterogeneity of relapse T cell responses to MBP to include clones restricted by additional class II glycoproteins. A role for additional CNS autoantigens in the stimulation of relapse T cells is also considered. Serum antibody responses to MBP or the P2 fragment fluctuated randomly throughout R-EAE when total antibody activity (IgM plus IgG) was measured. However, analysis of individual isotypes of IgG immunoglobulins revealed an apparent correlation between peak antigen-binding activity and disease expression which may reflect either an effector or regulatory role for humoral immunity in recurrent EAE. Patterns of early antibody reactivity also distinguished F1 mice that developed or failed to develop disease signs after immunization, the latter exhibiting a consistent drop in antigen-binding activity 4 to 5 days before the usual onset of acute-stage paralysis. The results are considered with regard to possible mechanisms of chronic disease regulation in an environment of functional T cell suppression.\r"

  ".W": "Adherent human blood monocytes were stimulated with heat-killed Staphylococcus albus or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide in the presence of 35S-methionine-, [3H]leucine-, or 14C-labeled amino acids. After incubation, interleukin 1 (IL 1) activity in the supernatant medium was purified over an anti-human IL 1 immunoadsorbent followed by gel filtration and chromatofocusing. The purity of the IL 1 was assessed by fluorography of one- and two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric and chromatofocusing of low m.w. proteins (less than 20,000 m.w.) revealed three charged 18,000 m.w. species of IL 1 with approximate pI's of 7, 6, and 5, with the most abundant form at pI 7. During the purification procedures, lymphocyte co-mitogenic activity, fever in rabbits, and prostaglandin E2 release from dermal fibroblasts co-eluted in the same fractions. In addition, these fractions were active when injected into endotoxin-resistant C3H/HeJ mice for the production of fever, the induction of serum amyloid A protein, a decrease in serum iron concentration, and an increase in the number of circulating neutrophils. Fluorography revealed homogeneous bands with an m.w. of about 18,000 which correlated with these biological activities. The specific activity of the pI 6 or 5 IL 1, as judged by the ratio of T cell co-mitogenic activity to incorporated radiolabeled amino acid, was at least 10-fold greater than that observed for the pI 7 form. This result suggests that the amino acid compositions of the two 18,000 m.w. acidic forms are unrelated to the pI 7 species. These results also demonstrate that the pI 7 human monocyte IL 1 is the predominant 18,000 m.w. form synthesized and, furthermore, that homogeneous pI 7 IL 1 exhibits multiple biological properties on various tissues by modulating immunologic, inflammatory, metabolic, and neurologic functions. Data are also presented for the existence of a high m.w. (32,000) human pro-IL 1 molecule as the predominant monocytic intracellular form. This pro-IL 1 is degraded artifactually during isolation to lower m.w. forms in the presence of an extracellular serine protease activity. These data are consistent with a model for IL 1 secretion in which pro-IL 1 is first synthesized within the cell and is processed during or after extracellular transport.\r"

  ".W": "UV irradiation of epidermal cells (EC) in vitro and in vivo leads to an enhanced synthesis of the immunostimulating cytokine interleukin 1 (IL 1). However, UV exposure in vivo also results in local as well as systemic immunosuppression. Therefore, it was tested whether UV-exposed murine EC in culture in addition to IL 1 release an inhibitor of IL 1 activity. Supernatants of UV-irradiated BALB/c EC and of a transformed keratinocyte cell line (Pam 212) were evaluated for their ability to suppress IL 1-mediated thymocyte proliferation. Crude supernatants derived from either UV-exposed or unirradiated EC did not interfere with IL 1 activity. When supernatants were subjected to HPLC gel filtration, fractions eluting at approximately 40 kD significantly blocked the activity of EC-derived IL 1 and murine recombinant IL 1. The release of this inhibitory cytokine (EC-derived contra-IL 1 [EC-contra-IL 1]) was confined to UV-exposed BALB/c or Pam 212 keratinocytes, since no inhibitory activity was detected in supernatants of unirradiated cells. EC-contra-IL 1 also blocked IL 1-induced fibroblast proliferation but did not suppress IL 2 or IL 3 activity. Moreover, EC-contra-IL 1 did not inhibit spontaneous proliferation of a variety of cell lines (Pam 212, P388D1, L 929, EL 4). With the use of chromatofocusing EC-contra-IL 1 exhibited a pI of 8.8, and upon reversed-phase chromatography it eluted within three distinct peaks. Therefore, murine UV-exposed EC, in addition to the production of immunoenhancing cytokines, also may release immunosuppressing mediators and thereby participate in UV-induced immunosuppression. These findings further support the notion that the epidermis may not only be considered as a simple barrier against harmful agents but represents an active element of the immune system.\r"

Possible interaction between IL 1 beta, the major mediator with osteoclast-activating factor (OAF) activity, and other cytokines was studied. By itself, IL 1 beta was 13-fold more potent than IL 1 alpha and 1000-fold more potent than either TNF or LT in stimulating bone resorption. Suboptimal concentrations of IL 1 beta or IL 1 alpha in combination with suboptimal concentrations of TNF or LT resulted in synergistic bone-resorptive responses (1.5 to 10 times the expected responses if their effects were additive). Synergy between either form of IL 1 and TNF or LT resulted in a twofold increase in activity of IL 1, and a 100-fold increase in activity of TNF or LT. However, even with optimal synergy, IL 1 beta remained 20-fold more potent in inducing bone resorption than TNF or LT. Because IL 1 beta is considerably more potent than TNF and LT in stimulating bone resorption either alone or under synergistic conditions, it is unlikely that TNF and LT are responsible for more than a minor proportion of the total bone-resorbing activity formerly referred to as OAF.\r"

One of the hybridomas constitutively released glycosylation-inhibiting factor (GIF) which lacked affinity for OA, and was called non-specific GIF. Incubation of the same hybridoma cells with OA-pulsed syngeneic macrophages or OA-pulsed B lymphoblastoid cells of BALB/c origin resulted in the formation of GIF molecules that had affinity for OA but not for bovine serum albumin or keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Both the OA-specific GIF and nonspecific GIF bound to monoclonal anti-lipocortin and possessed I-Jb determinants. The OA-specific GIF consisted of two species of molecules, of m.w. 80,000 and 30,000 to 40,000, respectively, whereas the nonspecific GIF from unstimulated cells had an m.w. of 15,000. Intravenous injections of OA-specific GIF or nonspecific GIF into BDF1 mice suppressed both the IgE and IgG1 anti-hapten antibody responses of the animals to dinitrophenyl derivatives of OA (DNP-OA), but OA-specific GIF was much more effective than nonspecific GIF in suppressing the antibody responses. When the same preparations of GIF were injected into DNP-KHL-primed mice, OA-specific GIF and nonspecific GIF were comparable in suppressing the anti-DNP antibody response. In contrast to the 40,000 m.w. species of OA-specific GIF, the 80,000 m.w. OA-specific GIF had carrier-specific suppressive effects. The similarities of antigen-specific GIF to antigen-specific TsF suggest that the phospholipase-inhibiting activity of the molecules may be involved in the immunosuppressive effects of some antigen-specific TsF.\r"

The mAb, beta Framework 1 (beta F1) is capable of immunoprecipitating the TCR alpha beta complex from 125I-labeled human T cell tumors, immunocompetent T cell clones, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). beta F1 recognizes the separated TCR beta subunit in Western blotting. Because it does not bind to the surface of viable T cells but does react with the plasma membrane form of the TCR after treatment with membrane solubilizing agents, the beta F1 mAb reacts with a \"hidden\" determinant on the TCR beta subunit. After solubilization with 70% ethanol, the TCR alpha beta complex is shown to exist on greater than 92% of T3+ human PBL, whereas 2 to 8% of T3+ PBL do not react with the mAb. The beta F1 mAb demonstrates the existence of differently glycosylated surface 125I-labeled TCR alpha-chains (alpha, alpha', alpha\") in association with a common TCR beta-chain on the HPB-MLT T cell leukemia. Reactivity of the beta F1 mAb on thymus tissue sections is similar to that of anti-Leu-4 (anti-T3). The beta F1 mAb should prove useful as a research tool for both the immunochemical characterization and isolation of virtually any alpha beta T cell receptor, whether from individual T cell clones or polyclonal populations of T lymphocytes. Recognition of T cell receptors in histologic tissue sections suggests that the beta F1 mAb may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of T cell lineage neoplasms. In failing to recognize all T3+ lymphocytes, it allows the identification of novel populations of T3+ lymphocytes that may express non-alpha, non-beta T cell receptors.\r"

To address the question of platelet receptors for free C1q, direct radioligand binding studies were performed by using human blood platelets and purified, 125I-labeled C1q, and a monoclonal antibody (II1/D1) (IgM, lambda) directed against C1q receptors on peripheral blood leukocytes. Washed platelets bound both purified 125I-labeled C1q and II1/D1 in a specific and saturable manner under physiologic ionic strength conditions. At equilibrium, approximately 4000 molecules of C1q bound per platelet with an apparent dissociation constant of 3.5 X 10(-7) M. Maximum C1q binding was achieved in 5 min and correlated well with inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Equilibrium binding of 125I-labeled II1/D1 to washed platelets required an incubation period of 15 to 30 min and II1/D1 concentrations approaching 50 micrograms/ml. Approximately 2000 molecules of II1/D1 bound per platelet, with an apparent dissociation constant of 2.8 X 10(-8) M. II1/D1 binding could be inhibited by the collagenous tail of C1q (c-C1q), suggesting that platelet receptors for these ligands are either the same or in close proximity. The data demonstrate that human blood platelets possess specific and saturable binding sites for free C1q that may function as collagen receptors, and may antigenically resemble C1q receptors on peripheral blood leukocytes.\r"

  ".U": "87110729\r", 
  ".W": "Previously, we reported that the generation of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for syngeneic tumors induced by AKR/Gross leukemia viruses was under multi-gene control. Thus, although carrying the required immune response gene(s) encoded by the H-2b haplotype and characteristic of responder strains such as C57BL/6, AKR.H-2b congenic mice failed to mount antiviral CTL responses. Young adult AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b \"doubly congenic\" mice, however, were able to generate specific anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL activity. These results demonstrated that the positive effect of MHC-encoded immune response gene control could be overcome by the action of the Fv-1n allele. The responder status of the B6.Fv-1n congenic, however, indicated that this Fv-1n-mediated inhibition was dependent on the interaction of Fv-1n with another gene(s) encoded by the AKR background. The results of experiments performed with AKXL recombinant inbred mice further suggested that a single additional genetic locus, encoding the Akv-1 provirus, was necessary along with Fv-1n to cause inhibition of antiviral CTL generation. Here we show that the responsiveness of AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice is dependent on their age. Thus, with moderate aging these doubly congenic mice converted to a nonresponder status with respect to anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL production: 85% of mice less than or equal to 9 wk of age responded compared with 0% of mice greater than 9 wk old. As with nonresponder AKR.H-2b mice, an inverse correlation was observed between CTL responsiveness and the expression of CTL-defined viral antigens by normal cells. Namely, spleen cells from young AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice showed little or no expression of such viral antigens, whereas with moderate aging there was a steady increase in their display. These results are discussed with reference to possible mechanisms of unresponsiveness of AKR.H-2b vs moderately aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice, and with respect to the utility of this system as a model for naturally occurring retrovirus infections and the interactions of retroviruses with the immune system.\r"

Genomic DNA from rabbits I and II also exhibit restriction fragment length polymorphism of C beta on Southern blots.

An approximately 14-kb cloned genomic DNA fragment from rabbit I has two copies of C beta exon 1 and a 6-kb fragment has a third copy, suggesting that rabbit I has three different C beta genes. The DNA sequence of a germ-line genomic DNA fragment encoding the first exon of the beta-chain constant region from rabbit I also has an open reading frame encoding 140 amino acids immediately 5' of the C beta sequence.

The average maximum tumor growth rate was 2 cm3/day, with a doubling time of 8 days. Tumors retained pretransplant gross and microscopic morphology, karyotype, and labeling index. Possible advantages of this model over the athymic nude mouse include greater longevity, larger animal and tumor size, and less stringent aseptic environmental requirements.

Foot-pad immunization of C3H mice with viable epidermal cells from syngeneic UVR-exposed mice induced cytotoxic cells in the draining lymph nodes (DLN). These cells were capable of lysing a battery of UVR-induced tumor targets in a short-term chromium release assay. In contrast, the DLN cells of mice immunized with epidermal cells from normal non-UVR-exposed mice did not mature into effector cells with antitumor activity. The spectrum of tumor recognition of cytotoxic cells induced by immunization with UVR-exposed epidermal cells was identical to that of cytotoxic T cells obtained from animals that were foot-pad immunized with UVR-induced tumor cells. Both cytotoxic cell populations were shown to lyse tumors of diverse origin, including syngeneic UVR- and methylcholanthrene-induced tumors, as well as allogeneic UVR-induced tumors. These cells displayed minimal lytic activity against YAC-1 lymphoma cells, peritoneal exudate cells, and concanavalin A-stimulated splenocytes. The results from this study demonstrate that antigens are expressed on UVR-exposed mouse epidermal cells prior to the emergence of skin tumors, and these antigens can induce cytotoxic cells with specificity for TAA. We conclude that the early antigenic changes observed in UVR-exposed epidermis and their effect on the host's immune system may influence the emergence and progression of UVR-induced skin cancers.\r"

Keratinocytes from canine oral mucosa, ear skin, and ventral abdominal skin were grown in culture either as explants or as dispase/trypsin-derived suspensions in the absence of a feeder cell layer. Cholera toxin and epidermal growth factor were essential to the successful long-term growth and propagation of the cells during multiple passages. Keratinocytes from all tissue sources, either as primary cultures or subcultivated for up to 10 passages, had growth characteristic and morphology similar to that reported in other species. The use of cultured canine keratinocytes should provide a suitable model for comparative in vitro studies of the pathogenesis of dermatologic diseases.\r"

Four treatments were assessed: dexamethasone alone, dexamethasone plus ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone alone, and no treatment. The brain water content in untreated rabbits with meningitis was 419 +/- 10 g of H2O/100g of dry weight after 29 hr of infection (vs. 405 +/- 14 in uninfected rabbits; P less than .05). In rabbits treated with dexamethasone, dexamethasone plus ceftriaxone, or ceftriaxone alone, these values were 404 +/- 12, 406 +/- 12, and 411 +/- 14 g, respectively (P greater than .05). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure and lactate levels were significantly increased in all animals during the 24 hr of meningeal inflammation (P less than .005), and these levels were comparably reduced after 9 hr of treatment. Although the values for brain water content, CSF pressure, and lactate concentrations in infected animals treated with ceftriaxone plus dexamethasone were not significantly different from those in animals treated with ceftriaxone alone, the values were consistently lower in the former group.\r"

It was recently noted, however, that certain commonly used assays of antibody to PRP produced incompatible results. To investigate this observation, we analyzed banked sera from four PRP vaccine studies in parallel by several assays. Significant differences were noted, both in absolute titers and in the ratios of post- to prevaccination titers, between the various assays. These differences seemed to be due to the different antigen preparations used in the assays. Unless workers standardize on a single assay, protective levels of antibody to PRP will have to be defined separately for each assay. Serological results of Hib vaccine trials cannot be compared without considering the assay methods used.\r"

Culture on modified Diamond's medium was more sensitive (98%) than the wet mount method (38%) in detecting T. vaginalis. Of the 86 patients who were positive for trichomoniasis, quantitation was obtained for 81 patients, with 70% yielding greater than 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The number of T. vaginalis ranged from 40 to greater than 10(6) cfu/ml.

HIV was recovered from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 22 of 28 patients tested. Most serum samples examined by immunoblot assay reacted with the viral envelope and gag gene precursors gp160 and p55. Of the 155 patients, 12 had AIDS at the time of diagnosis, and the syndrome developed in an additional 43 patients in one to 31 months. Survival analysis showed that the probability of AIDS developing in patients with HL was 48% by 16 months and 83% by 31 months. We conclude that oral HL is highly predictive of the development of AIDS.\r"

We suggest that these basal crosslinks support the long vestibular stereocilia rendering them more rigid, and that the upwind pointing crosslinks are responsible for the initiation of sensory transduction.\r"

Intermittent chronic low frequency stimulation of muscles in six young ambulant children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulted in a significant increase (p less than 0.05) in mean maximum voluntary contraction compared with the mean forces exerted by the unstimulated control muscles of the contralateral leg.\r"

Two courses of initial (induction) cisplatin, bleomycin, and methotrexate with oral calcium leucovorin (PBM) were used with the principal intent of increasing the effectiveness of subsequent surgery and/or radiotherapy. Following induction chemotherapy and local treatment, disease-free patients who had responded to initial chemotherapy were entered into a randomized trial of adjuvant PBM. The response rates to induction PBM chemotherapy were a complete response (CR) rate of 26% and a partial response (PR) rate of 52%, for an overall response rate of 78%. A response to induction PBM was highly correlated with failure-free survival (P less than .0001). A Cox multistep regression analysis of potential prognostic factors was performed. After adjusting for the significant prognostic factors of performance status, initial tumor size, and primary tumor site, a response to induction chemotherapy remained independently associated with improved survival (P = .0002). The randomized trial of adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated that such treatment significantly improved failure-free survival by decreasing local-regional failures. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was particularly evident in patients who had a PR to induction chemotherapy (P = .01). The toxicity of this multidisciplinary approach was predictable and acceptable. Surgery and radiotherapy were not compromised by induction or adjuvant chemotherapy. Definitive evidence that chemotherapy can favorably influence survival awaits confirmation of these results by a randomized trial using a control arm of patients treated with conventional surgery and/or radiotherapy alone.\r"

We found that biopsies from patients with accelerating disease can reveal cytologic transformation from previously observed small, convoluted lymphocytes to large cells that are similar to cells seen in large-cell lymphoma. The cerebriform nuclei characteristic of malignant T cells can only rarely be identified. Of 150 cutaneous T cell lymphoma patients we treated from 1976 to 1984, cytologic transformation was identified in 12 after review of peripheral blood smears and biopsies from skin, lymph nodes, and visceral sites. Patients who developed cytologic transformation were initially characterized by advanced stage (11 of 12), with lymph node effacement (seven of 11) and erythroderma (five of 12). The tumor cell DNA content after transformation was aneuploid (four of four), and the ability to form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes was retained in transformed cells (three of three). The median time from diagnosis of cutaneous T cell lymphoma to cytologic transformation was 21.5 months (range, 4 to 64), and the median survival from transformation was only 2 months (range, 0 to 19+). We conclude that cytologic transformation in cutaneous T cell lymphoma represents a distinct clinicopathologic entity, characterized by an aggressive clinical course.\r"

To assess this observation, we analyzed the SPECT thallium scans of 74 sequential patients who had SPECT thallium scintigraphy and contrast ventriculography and/or echocardiography for evaluation of coronary artery disease. Immediate post-stress and 4-hr redistribution thallium-201 SPECT images, obtained following i.v. administration of 2 mCi of thallium-201, were reconstructed with no attenuation correction using three-dimensional linear and nonlinear filters and displayed in short, vertical-long, and horizontal-long axes. Of the 74 patients, contrast ventriculography and/or echocardiography showed anterior/apical aneurysms in 15 and a posterolateral aneurysm in one. SPECT thallium scans detected 14 of the 16 aneurysms, based on the criterion of failure of convergence of the ventricular walls toward the apex. There were two false-positives. Thus SPECT thallium-201 scintigraphy for the detection of left-ventricular aneurysm in this series had a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 97%, and an accuracy of 96%.\r"

Whole-body distribution studies demonstrated a brain uptake of 4.3% of the dose compared with 0.9% for [201TI]chloride. No differences were found in the distribution of [201TI]DDC versus [201TI]chloride in other organs. After the injection of 3 mCi 201TI, good quality single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) images of the brain were obtained with both a rotating gamma camera and a multidetector system. In ischemic brain disease, perfusion defects were easily demonstrated. We conclude that [201TI]DDC is a suitable radiopharmaceutical for SPECT studies of cerebral blood flow.\r"

The neutral, lipophilic 99mTc complex of d,l-HM-PAO was formed in high yield by stannous reduction of 99Mo/99mTc generator eluate using a kit formulation of the ligand. Two minutes following i.v. administration of this complex in rats, 2.25% of the injected dose appears in the brain. Little washout of the tracer is observed up to 24 hr postinjection. By qualitative autoradiographic comparison with iodoantipyrine this new radiopharmaceutical displays blood flow dependent brain uptake with little redistribution of the tracer over time. The lipophilic 99mTc complex converts slowly in vitro to a secondary complex. This conversion process may account for the ability of [99mTc]d,l-HM-PAO to be retained within the brain without redistribution.\r"

We studied nearly all Alaskan Eskimo children who had had invasive Hib disease between 1971 and 1982 in southwestern Alaska (n = 103) and an equivalent number of controls matched for age, race, and village of residence, and verified not to have had proved or suspected Hib disease. We found no significant associations with Hib disease for the single alleles of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, Gm, Km, Am, Kidd, MNSs, ABO, esterase D, or glutamate pyruvate transaminase loci. However, we observed a significant interaction of two loci, Gm(a;..;g,s,t) allotype and HLA-DR8 (P = 0.002), with increased Hib disease susceptibility, and an interaction of the same Gm allotype and HLA-DR5 with decreased disease susceptibility (P = 0.01). We also compared the level of anticapsular antibody to Hib with each genetic marker and two-locus interactions, but no genetic association with antibody level was found. We conclude that some genetic factors contribute to the susceptibility to invasive Hib disease in this population.\r"

  ".W": "The neurochemical effects of the unique psychedelic agent, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), indicate it may be a serotonergic neurotoxin related to agents such as p-chloroamphetamine. MDMA had a biphasic effect on cortical serotonin concentrations beginning with an acute depletion of the transmitter which reached a maximum between 3 and 6 hr after drug administration. This early phase of depletion was reversible because cortical serotonin concentrations had recovered to control levels by 24 hr. However, transmitter concentrations were reduced significantly 1 week later, indicating a second phase of depletion. The latter phase of depletion was associated with a decrease in synaptosomal [3H]serotonin uptake due to a loss in the number of uptake sites with no change in the affinity of the carrier for serotonin. This neurotoxic effect of MDMA was found to be a property of the (+)-stereoisomer of the drug as only this enantiomer produced the depletion of cortical serotonin and the decrease in synaptosomal serotonin uptake at 1 week. In contrast to this, both stereoisomers of the drug could produce the acute depletion of cortical serotonin measured 3 hr after drug administration. Coadministration of the selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, completely blocked the reduction in cortical serotonin concentrations 1 week after MDMA. Administration of fluoxetine at various times after MDMA revealed that the long-term effects of the drug developed independently of the acute depletion of serotonin and could be partially blocked by the uptake inhibitor as long as 6 hr after drug administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At low concentrations (0.1-0.5 microM) of VX, typical effects due to cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition, such as potentiation of indirect muscle twitches as well as increases in the peak amplitude and decay time constant (tau EPC) of end-plate currents (EPC), were observed. At concentrations greater than or equal to 1.0 microM, VX produced opposite effects. The indirectly elicited muscle twitches and EPC peak amplitude were depressed with an IC50 of about 33 microM. tau EPC was reduced, and at a higher concentration of 100 microM, VX split the decays into faster and slower components. Similar results were also obtained with the amplitude and decays of miniature end-plate currents (MEPC). However, although the MEPC peak amplitude and tau MEPC were not decreased to levels below control values, EPC peak amplitude (but not its tau EPC) was markedly depressed beyond the control values, in a concentration-dependent manner. The fact that nerve action potential-evoked events were more affected than the spontaneous MEPCs suggested an interference with the depolarization-evoked release process. Indeed, VX caused a reduction of the quantal content and, in addition, induced a significant increase in the frequency of MEPCs. All these effects, except the anti-ChE activity, were reversible upon wash. The results from both EPC fluctuation analysis and single channel recordings disclosed a concentration-dependent shortening of the channel open times without change in single channel conductance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Platelet content of both DA and DAS increased linearly with incubation time and tissue concentration. Increasing the concentration of DA in the incubation medium also increased platelet content of both DA and DAS. However, after prolonged incubation times or in the presence of high concentrations of DA, the percentage conversion of DA to DAS decreased; this decrease was reversed at least partially by incubation in the presence of sodium sulfate, suggesting that sulfate availability may limit sulfoconjugation under some conditions. Incubation with fluoxetine produced a concentration-dependent decrease in both DA and DAS content of the platelets. In contrast, the agent 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol, an inhibitor of the enzyme phenol sulfotransferase, did not interfere with DA uptake, but did inhibit DAS formation in a concentration-dependent manner. These studies suggest that the human platelet may represent a useful model system for the study of factors regulating DA sulfoconjugation.\r"

A direct relationship was found between the component of the peptide-induced contraction that appeared to be neurally mediated and the magnitude of the subsequent contracture induced by naloxone. Moreover, the opioid agonist FK 33-824 decreased the contractile effect of the excitatory peptides and also increased the height of the naloxone-induced contractures. That effect was particularly evident when the higher doses of the peptides were studied. In the presence of atropine naloxone elicited small contractures when added after peptides with primarily neural actions, including corticotropin-releasing factor, neurotensin and cholecystokinin octapeptide 26-33 sulfated form. The naloxone-induced contracture appears to be mediated mainly by the release of acetylcholine, and to a minor extent by another spasmogenic substance from the myenteric plexus. It is concluded that endogenous opioids modulate, i.e., inhibit the release of those excitatory endogenous transmitters triggered by the effect of excitatory peptides upon the myenteric plexus.\r"

All patients were the victims of blunt abdominal trauma. Nine patients with CT evidence of mesenteric or bowel hematomas were observed without adverse outcome. Fifteen were operatively explored, with 14 having injuries similar to the findings on the preoperative CT scans. In the group that had surgery, either thickened bowel or free intraperitoneal fluid (blood or less dense fluid) or both were present in all but one patient. Extraluminal air (three cases) or Gastrografin (Squibb) (one case) were absolute indications for surgery, as were bowel wall or mesenteric hematomas accompanied by substantial amounts of intraperitoneal fluid. The patient's history, physical examination, and initial laboratory values are important in proper selection of patients for CT evaluation. We feel that CT appears to offer certain definite advantages over peritoneal lavage in evaluation of bowel and mesenteric injuries and can reliably help to distinguish the injuries that require surgical repair from those that can be safely monitored and observed.\r"

To address the question of whether the volume-outcome relationship continues to exist for this new group of patients, discharge abstracts for 18,986 CABG operations at 77 hospitals in California in 1983 were analyzed using multiple-regression techniques. Higher-volume hospitals had lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted for case mix); this effect was greatest in patients who might be characterized as having \"non-scheduled\" CABG surgery. Higher-volume hospitals also had shorter average postoperative lengths of stay and fewer patients with extremely long stays. The results of this study suggest that the greatest improvement in average outcomes for CABG surgery would result from the closure of low-volume surgery units.\r"

  ".W": "Metastasis is a temperature-related phenomenon in the North American leopard frog (Rana pipiens) affected with the Lucke renal adenocarcinoma. The frog is a poikilothermic vertebrate whose internal body temperature closely follows that of the environment, and tumor-bearing frogs living in a warm (28 degrees C) environment have a much higher incidence of metastasis (greater than 75%) than those in cold (4 degrees C) conditions (less than 6%). In this investigation it was found that Lucke tumor cells labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate could be detected in frozen sections of all organs examined within 15 minutes, regardless of whether the hosts were adapted to a warm or a cold environment. Separate experiments involving inoculation of isotope-labeled tumor cells demonstrated that large numbers of cells arrived in the liver and other organs of animals kept at either end of the temperature range. These findings show that the infrequency of metastasis by Lucke adenocarcinomas in chilled frogs is not due to failure of dissemination of tumor cells consequent upon temperature-mediated changes in blood viscosity or flow patterns. Thus they establish the important baseline that the effects of temperature on metastasis in this vertebrate are exerted directly on the tumor cells and/or the internal environment of the host and that the system therefore provides new opportunities for probing the biology and biochemistry of tumor metastasis.\r"

At the 20th week, approximately 95% of these rats had bladder tumors. The response of thymus lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in these BBN-treated rats began to decrease from the 10th week and decreased significantly from the 18th week as compared with that in untreated rats. This reduced response to PHA was slower in comparison with the reduced response to concanavalin A. When thymus lymphocytes were preincubated with thymosin fraction 5 in vitro, the response to PHA improved between the 8th week and the 20th week. Furthermore, when the thymus small lymphocyte population was separated into 3 subpopulations by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation and adhesion column, the restorative effect of the thymus hormonal product was greater in the intermediate and heavier subpopulations.\r"

The efficacy of fibrin \"glue\" to seal esophagogastric anastomoses was evaluated as a means of preventing this complication. A left thoracotomy was performed in 25 adult mongrel dogs. After esophagogastric resection, a standardized esophagogastrostomy was performed and eight interrupted sutures were used to completely close the posterior wall. The anterior wall was approximated with only three sutures, leaving four large holes between sutures. The dogs were then randomized into the control group (n = 14; no attempt to seal the leaks) or into the fibrin glue-treated group (n = 11). An average of 3.3 ml of glue was applied to the anterior wall of the anastomosis in the treated group. In the control group, 13 of 14 dogs (92.9%) died of anastomotic leak a median of 3 days after operation. In the fibrin glue-treated group, only four of 11 dogs (36.4%) died of anastomotic leaks (p less than 0.01). Dogs that survived were put to death at 14 days. Postmortem examination in all dogs revealed no deleterious effects or complications related to the glue. Postmortem examination of the one surviving control dog and the seven fibrin glue-treated dogs that did not die of sepsis revealed a healed anastomosis without abscess formation. We conclude that fibrin glue is effective in lessening the incidence of esophagogastric anastomotic leaks as employed in this experimental model.\r"

In contrast, we report 500 consecutive coronary artery bypass operations with intermittent aortic clamping for distal anastomoses, left ventricular venting, and 30 degrees C hypothermia. Average patient age was 62 years (range of 30 to 89 years). The number of patients who had urgent or emergency operations was 194 (39%); 251 patients had unstable angina, and 123 others had preinfarction angina (pain at rest in the hospital); 27 had evolving myocardial infarction. The average number of grafts was 3.3 per patient, and the average ischemic time was 7.65 minutes per graft. There were five hospital deaths (1%); none resulted from poor myocardial protection that caused low cardiac output. Only three survivors (0.6%) required a balloon pump to be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass: two had acute infarctions preoperatively, and the other had an ejection fraction of 0.30 and intractable atrial arrhythmias. Only two other patients (0.4%) received any inotropic infusions postoperatively. Eighteen patients (3.6%) had a perioperative infarction. These results, particularly the virtual absence of postoperative inotropic support, in unselected patients of whom 80% had acute coronary syndromes, indicate that intermittent ischemia can provide excellent myocardial protection for coronary bypass. Brief periods of intermittent ischemia alleviate concern about cardioplegic protection via occluded coronaries or internal mammary grafts and provide a simple and safe option for myocardial protection during coronary artery bypass.\r"

There were no procedural-related deaths and two myocardial infarctions. Forty-six percent of the patients with successful angioplasty after previous bypass grafting remain symptom free after 5 years versus 79% of the patients without previous bypass grafting (p less than 0.001). Long-term success rates for native vessel angioplasty as compared with bypass graft angioplasty are similar. Patients with a short interval between the recurrence of angina after bypass grafting and the angioplasty attempt have a better chance of long-term success. Repeat angiography indicates that a restenosis occurs after angioplasty of a venous graft in 31% and in the native system in 28.6% and that signs of progression of coronary artery disease elsewhere are present in 30%. Of the 83 patients, 11 had reoperation eventually. We conclude that percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty after coronary bypass grafting gives less satisfactory results than a primary procedure, that angioplasty provides symptomatic relief in a smaller number of patients than in those with primary angioplasty, but that symptomatic relief is often sufficient to further postpone or prevent bypass grafting and can be achieved with low mortality and low complication rates.\r"

Stepwise logistic regression identified sex, preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction, and the urgency of operation as independent risk factors for postoperative mortality. Urgent revascularization was performed in patients with unstable angina refractory to maximal medical therapy. In these patients the operative mortality was 8.5%. Independent risk factors of postoperative morbidity, in addition to sex, ejection fraction, and urgent revascularization, included a previous bypass procedure, age, and New York Heart Association functional class. Unstable angina unresponsive to medical therapy contributed significantly to the operative risk. Interventions to reduce perioperative ischemic injury, such as improved methods of myocardial protection, may improve the results in high-risk patients.\r"

HIV-I-infected subjects who remained symptom-free, by comparison with those who manifested AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC), had a significantly higher titre of anti-p24 antibodies throughout the 3 years, as measured by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunoprecipitation. The symptomless subjects also showed a trend towards an increasing neutralising antibody titre with time. There was no relation between anti-gp41 titre and clinical outcome, nor an independent relation between anti-p24 and neutralising titre. A lower or falling titre of anti-p24 antibody was associated significantly with clinical progression, up to 27 months before development of AIDS/ARC.\r"

The disease is more prevalent in some geographic areas than in others, and there is a probable ethnic predisposition. Buerger's disease is decidedly rare in women; only 24 cases with histologic proof of the disease have ever been recorded, including 12 new cases described in this article. The clinical presentation and histopathology of TAO in women differ in no way from that in men. There is no evidence that the disease is milder in women, since 9 of the 12 in this series underwent amputation and the remaining 3 required reconstructive and bypass surgical intervention. Awareness of the entity and familiarity with the clinical, angiographic, and pathologic features of the disease are the key to a prompt and correct diagnosis of Buerger's disease.\r"

We used positron emission tomography and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose to study cerebral glucose metabolism in 95 subjects: 58 clinically asymptomatic (chorea-free) subjects at risk for Huntington's disease, 10 symptomatic patients with the disease, and 27 controls. All the symptomatic patients had marked reductions in caudate glucose metabolism. Despite a normal structural appearance on computed tomography, caudate glucose metabolism was bilaterally reduced in 31 percent of the subjects at risk (18 of 58). Using each at-risk subject's age and the sex of the affected parent, we averaged individual risk estimates for the development of Huntington's disease for this group and predicted that the probability of having the clinically unexpressed Huntington's disease gene should be 33.9 +/- 6.0 percent for the group. Thus, there was excellent agreement between the predicted percentage of carriers of the Huntington's disease gene (33.9 +/- 6.0 percent) and the percentage with metabolic abnormalities of the caudate nuclei (31 percent). These results indicate that the measurement of glucose metabolism may allow the observation of the pathophysiologic effects of the Huntington's disease gene during the natural development of the disease. It may also provide a direct means to monitor the response to experimental treatments during both the clinically asymptomatic and the symptomatic phases of the disorder.\r"

According to this strategy, recombinant-DNA probes simultaneously detect restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms and patterns of methylation of X-chromosome genes. Random X-inactivation patterns were observed in isolated peripheral-blood granulocytes, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes of women who were not carriers. In contrast, one of the two X chromosomes was preferentially active in the peripheral B cells, but not the T cells or granulocytes, of three carriers of the disorder. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that X-linked agammaglobulinemia results from an intrinsic defect in B-cell development. Moreover, the analysis described here can be used for direct identification of carriers in families with this disease.\r"

TNF-alpha is a non-glycosylated protein of relative molecular mass 17,000 (Mr 17 K), whereas TNF-beta is a glycoprotein of Mr 25 K. Both TNF-alpha and TNF-beta aggregate into multimers and act through the same receptor molecule on target cells. Genes encoding these two TNF proteins have been cloned from mouse and man and in both are closely linked, being separated by approximately 1 kilobase (kb) of DNA. In the mouse these genes are located on chromosome 17, but in man they are on the short arm of chromosome 6. This segment of chromosome 6 also contains the genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), as does chromosome 17 in the mouse. To find out whether the TNF genes are located within the MHC, we used polymorphic restriction sites to analyse a panel of MHC congeneic and intra-MHC recombinant mouse strains. Initially, we mapped the TNF genes the D or Qa region in the distal half of the mouse MHC. We then studied a gene cluster encompassing part of the D and Qa regions and found the TNF genes are located 70 kb proximal to the D gene.\r"

In chromosome jumping, this limitation is overcome by the deletion of all but the extreme ends of large DNA molecules before cloning. We describe here the construction and characterization of a NotI 'jumping library' from human DNA. To characterize this library, random clones were analysed by restriction mapping. Clones carrying unique end fragments were characterized further by hybridization to Southern blots of NotI-cleaved human DNA separated on pulsed field gradient (PFG) gels. As a first step in a directional walk, the library was screened with a clone containing a NotI site cleaved in genomic DNA ('NotI linking clone') localized to the distal third of the short arm of human chromosome 4 (A.-M.F. & T.P., unpublished data). Starting and end points of two identified clones were positioned within a restriction map covering 850 kilobases.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of an animal to respond to a given antigenic peptide depends on its major histocompatibility complex (MHC) type. Some peptides are not immunogenic when combined with a particular form of the MHC-encoded molecule. This non-responsiveness is regulated by immune response (Ir) genes and is thought to arise by one of two distinct mechanisms. Either the MHC-encoded molecules physically fail to interact with the antigen, preventing the activation of T cells with appropriate receptors, or they limit the expressed repertoire of T cell clones so that no T cells are available to be activated by existing complexes of MHC-encoded molecules and antigen. Experimental evidence has been generated to support both mechanisms. However, the relative importance of each has not been clearly established. In this study we started with a peptide that was immunogenic in B10 mice; it was thus known to be able to interact with the MHC molecule, and T cells existed which could recognise the peptide-MHC complex. Based on previous experiments, we then changed only those parts of the peptide that we thought interacted with the T-cell receptor. All the new analogues created were still immunogenic, confirming that the amino-acid substitutions that we had made did not prevent productive interactions with the MHC-encoded molecule. No limitations ('holes') in the T-cell repertoire were found. The experiments demonstrate the vast potential of the T-cell population to recognize many different analogues, each in a unique way, and suggest that constraints on the diversity of the T-cell repertoire may not be a major explanation for Ir gene defects.\r"

A major question, however, is how their substrates mediate changes in gene expression (reviewed in refs 6-8). Because binding of proteins to specific DNA sequences represents the most direct mechanism for regulating transcription, we have investigated the possibility that some DNA-binding proteins may be substrates of protein-tyrosine kinases. Here, we present evidence for nuclear phosphotyrosyl-proteins in murine fibroblasts transformed by the v-abl protein-tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, we have found that these proteins are not significantly phosphorylated in normal NIH 3T3 cells. Finally, using affinity competition chromatography with bacterial and mouse DNA, we have demonstrated that some of these proteins preferentially bind to mouse DNA. The identification of phosphotyrosyl-proteins with selective DNA-binding properties suggests a possible mechanism through which protein-tyrosine kinases may effect changes in gene transcription.\r"

  ".W": "Eukaryotic messenger RNAs are translated with unequal efficiencies in vivo and in vitro and the molecular basis of this phenomenon is not understood. As an approach to understanding the role of the 5' untranslated leader sequence in regulating mRNA translational efficiency, chimaeric mRNAs have been generated by joining a heterologous leader to complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences, followed by in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase and in vitro protein synthesis. We used the untranslated leader from the coat protein mRNA of alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV RNA 4), a well-translated, highly competitive message, to replace the leader sequence of barley alpha-amylase (B alpha A) and human interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) cDNAs. Deletion of transcribed vector sequences and replacement of the native untranslated region with the AMV RNA 4 leader can result in as much as a 35-fold increase in mRNA translational efficiency; moreover, the translational efficiency of the chimaeric mRNAs containing the AMV RNA 4 leader is at least as great as that of virion RNA 4. The results suggest that the chimaeric AMV-mRNAs have either a higher relative affinity or a diminished requirement for a limiting component(s) of the translational machinery; in addition, it may be feasible, through use of heterologous leader sequences, to increase expression of engineered genes or cDNAs without changing the antigenic or biological properties of the encoded protein.\r"

  ".W": "Untransformed T-cell clones maintained in culture are dependent on signals transmitted through their antigen receptors (Ti; alpha and beta chains associated with the CD3 molecules) for growth and effector function. For cytolytic T cells (CTL), Ti stimulation also activates the killing machinery and induces synthesis of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) messenger RNA and IFN-gamma secretion. The Thy-1 molecule, expressed on all murine cells of the T-cell lineage, has been suggested to function in transmembrane signalling, based on the ability of some anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to activate T cells. Recently, it was suggested that Thy-1 could function as a signal-transduction molecule when expressed in B-cell lymphomas after transfection of the gene, leading to speculation that the molecule was part of an activation pathway independent of the Ti/CD3 structures. Here we report the immunoselection of a variant CTL clone which has lost expression of mRNA for the alpha-chain of the Ti. The Ti- variant was defective in lectin-mediated activation whether measured by increase in intracytoplasmic Ca2+, CTL effector function or IFN-gamma synthesis. The variant, which expressed normal levels of Thy-1, was also unresponsive to Thy-1 mAb activation as measured by IFN-gamma secretion, whereas it responded to calcium ionophore plus phorbol ester. These results indicate that in a non-transformed, functional mature T-cell, Thy-1 mediated signalling is not an alternative to, but might depend on elements associated with the Ti/CD3-mediated T-cell activation pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The genes encoding the alpha and beta chains of the T-cell receptor (Ti) of an antigen-specific, Ia-restricted murine T-cell hybridoma were introduced into T3-positive or T3-negative human T cells. The resultant transfectants express either mouse-human or mouse-mouse Ti alpha beta molecules functionally associated with the human T3 complex. Only the complete murine Ti alpha beta dimer mediates specific functional corecognition of the appropriate antigen-Ia pair.\r"
