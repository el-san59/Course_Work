The technical procedure utilized a single blind format. The tastants were presented to the subjects in a multiple forced-choice sample presentation with an ascending series. Additional testing conditions included adequate oral hygiene, 10 ml of tastant, timed intervals, and deionized water rinses. The major findings were that sour, salt, and bitter thresholds increased with age. Sweet threshold did not change with age. The institutionalized elderly men had significantly higher sour detection thresholds when compared with the noninstitutionalized elderly men. The use of salt and tobacco had no apparent effect on detection thresholds for sweet, salt and bitter, but medication ingestion elevated the sour thresholds. Elderly subjects on antihypertensive medications had significantly higher salt detection thresholds.\r"

All participants read advertising passages for various fictitious products and evaluated the truthfulness of test sentences that paraphrased the critical claims pragmatically implied or directly asserted in the ad. In addition, half of the participants in each age group received individualized training in making implication-assertion discriminations. For both types of ad forms (implied, asserted), young and old adults produced an equivalent number of truth ratings, suggesting that both age groups are equally likely to interpret implied information as directly asserted fact. Analysis of the training results indicated that old as well as young adults learned to discriminate successfully between implied and asserted ad claims, although training had only a small effect on the participants' tendency to draw unwarranted inferences.\r"

Results suggested that each ability factor loaded on separate personality dimensions established in a previous analysis of HIT data using this sample. Whereas the personality factors labeled Anxiety Over Ideational Sufficiency and Feelings About Bodily Integrity loaded on Gc, factors termed Use of Cognitive Resources to Deal With Reality and Organizational Ability/Intellectual Functioning loaded on Gf. Causal inferences are difficult to make. However, these data suggest that individual differences in the maintenance of higher levels of intellectual functioning in later adulthood might be motivated by ego defensive mechanisms that act to insulate the older individual from feelings of self-worthlessness and failure and/or a loss of control over external forces via the development of intellectual skills.\r"

Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) on the activity data confirmed a recent cross-sectional study in two respects: First, gradual intensification of mean daily activity to adulthood was followed by a decline in senescence to a level below that found in early youth. Second, in comparison with early adulthood, a decline in activity during the dark phase was combined with an increase during the light phase as aging to senescence occurred.\r"

Planned comparisons indicated that the experimental groups differed significantly from the control group at the first posttest as well as across both posttest occasions on near versus far transfer tasks. However, self-generated strategies for task solution were found to be more durable over time as compared to specific rule training on near versus far transfer.\r"

There was a sex differential in the effect of living alone for some, but not all, of the eating behaviors. Both the probability of eating away from home and of skipping breakfast declined with age, as did the percentage of calories consumed from snacks. These results indicate a need to focus further research not only on the effects these eating behaviors have on the nutritional status of elderly persons, but also on middle-aged cohorts as they age and on food programs targeted at elderly persons living alone.\r"

The scene trauma score (TS) of the two groups was 10.2 (SD = 3.11) and 15.2 (SD = 1.38), respectively (P less than .0005). In the field, blind nasotracheal intubation by an emergency physician (n = 59) or paramedic (n = 3) was successful in 62 of 65 cases (95.1%). The complication rate for this procedure was 4.6%. Cricothyrotomy was performed in two patients. Only three orotracheal intubations were performed. The remaining three patients were nasotracheally intubated in the emergency department. Neuromuscular blockade was not used in either setting. Despite the difference in patient acuity, there was no statistically significant difference in scene or transport times between those patients emergently intubated and those who were not (P greater than .05).\r"

  ".U": "88198972\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of low concentration aldehyde treatment (0.0012 to 0.005%) on the expression of HLA-DR Ag by human monocytes was investigated. This treatment was shown to selectively abolish the expression of HLA-DR determinants defined by a monomorphic mAb (YE2.36) in a rosette assay. The expression of class I MHC Ag and Fc gamma R remained unaffected. As a result, the presentation of the recall Ag tetanus toxoid and streptokinase-streptodornase (SK-SD) to freshly isolated autologous T cells and T cell clones was completely inhibited. Increasing the concentration of aldehyde to 0.05% consistently produced partial restoration of Ag-presenting capacity. Low dose aldehyde treatment did not affect monocyte viability or membrane turnover. Thus, aldehyde-treated monocytes produced a second generation of HLA-DR and expression was almost completely restored to normal after 24 h of culture. The presentation of monocyte class II Ag as alloantigens was also inhibited by low dose aldehyde treatment but inhibition was much less marked when monocytes were aldehyde treated at 2 h rather than at 24 h of culture. This is consistent with the reexpression of HLA-DR which occurred readily in the first 24 h of culture and much less readily thereafter. Low dose aldehyde treatment did not affect Ag uptake and processing. However, monocytes which had been pulsed with Ag, aldehyde-treated to abolish HLA-DR, and then cultured to allow regeneration of HLA-DR could present Ag only when given a second Ag pulse, suggesting that once the association between microbial Ag and HLA-DR had formed the Ag was not then free to reassociate with novel HLA-DR. Low dose aldehyde treatment did not affect monocyte IL-1 production, neither did it inhibit the detection of HLA-DR by soluble mAb in FACS analysis. These results are consistent with the view that low dose aldehyde treatment disrupts the tertiary structure of human Ia molecules such that allostimulatory determinants and restriction elements for exogenous Ag are rendered inaccessible to T lymphocyte receptors and to cell-bound anti-DR mAb in the rosette assay, although DR determinants may remain accessible to soluble mAb.\r"

Of those analyzed, 4 of 35 (11%) MRL/lpr, 0 of 25 NZB/W F1 and 0 of 13 control NIH/Swiss mice had anti-P antibodies. Anti-P specificity was confirmed by immunoblotting of ribosomal proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by inhibition of anti-P reactivity on immunoblots with the synthetic peptide Ag.

Several combination pairs of human and murine cells, differing significantly in response to TNF toxicity, yet expressing a similar level of TNF receptors, were examined. In all combinations tested, the heterokaryons exhibited resistance to TNF toxicity, comparable, in extent, to that of the more resistant of the two parental cell lines. This dominance of resistance suggests that differences in vulnerability to TNF toxicity reflect activities which are expressed by resistant cells and are deficient in vulnerable ones, activities which perhaps protect the cell against the cytocidal effect of TNF.\r"

  ".U": "88198998\r", 
  ".W": "Two types of IgG FcR, FcRI and FcRII, are constitutively expressed by human monocytes. FcRI (identified by mAb 32.2) binds human (h) IgG, FcRII (identified by mAb IV.3) has a low affinity for hIgG but interacts strongly with murine (m) IgG1. These receptors can be assayed by using indicator E sensitized by hIgG (EA-hIgG) or mIgG1 (EA-mIgG1), respectively. We further characterized these two FcR by modulation studies by using substrate-immobilized immune complexes containing rabbit IgG, goat IgG, or one of the mouse Ig classes or subclasses. After incubating monocytes in microtiter wells containing such immune complexes, binding of the two types of indicator red cells on the apical surface of the monocytes was quantitated using a photometric assay employing the pseudoperoxidase activity of E. No effect on the binding of sensitized E was observed after incubation of monocytes with immune complexes containing mouse IgE, IgA, or IgM, or F(ab')2 fragments of rabbit IgG. High concentrations of immune complexes containing IgG of mouse, rabbit, or goat, however, were able to induce a decrease in binding of both types of sensitized E, suggestive of modulation of both FcRI and FcRII. At lower concentrations of immune complexes, more selective patterns of modulation emerged. Under these conditions, immune complexes containing mIgG1 or mIgG2b, or, surprisingly, goat IgG induced a selective decrease in the binding of EA-mIgG1 (FcRII modulation), while immune complexes containing mIgG2a or rabbit IgG mainly affected the binding of EA-hIgG (FcRI modulation). By using anti-FcR mAb IV.3, it was confirmed that FcRII was modulated from the apical surface of monocytes after incubation on immune complex coated substrates. Selectivity of FcR-modulation was demonstrated by showing that under these conditions binding of anti-C receptor mAb, and several other anti-monocyte mAb did not decrease.\r"

Immunoblot analysis confirmed that this antibody recognized the original immunizing protein as well as a 44- to 48-kDa protein from several raf-transformed cell lines. Immunoprecipitation experiments isolated a 48-kDa protein from a cell line transfected with a c-raf construct as well as from normal NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Parallel experiments with polyvalent antiserum prepared against E. coli-derived v-raf (C terminus)-precipitated proteins with apparent Mr of 48 and 74 kDa, as had been described previously. Immunofluorescence flow cytometry of raf-transformed cell lines revealed intense intracytoplasmic staining. This staining was specifically inhibited by preincubation of STEGI 1 with purified raf 30-kDa protein. It should now be possible to more easily assess the role of the raf oncogene product in malignant transformation.\r"

  ".U": "88199004\r", 
  ".W": "LPS priming of the neutrophil results in enhanced release of superoxide upon subsequent stimulation, but the mechanism of this effect remains obscure. The recent recognition that neutrophils synthesize and retain platelet-activating factor within the cell led us to hypothesize that enhanced synthesis of platelet-activating factor in the LPS-primed cell might account for the observed effects of lipopolysaccharide. Using human neutrophils isolated on plasma-Percoll gradients, we found that incubation with 100 ng/ml LPS for 60 min resulted in a small but significant increase in intracellular platelet-activating factor assessed after lipid extraction, TLC, and bioassay. The further stimulation of primed neutrophils with FMLP resulted in a marked increase in neutrophil platelet-activating factor compared with non-LPS-treated controls. The priming effect of LPS was time dependent (30 to 60 min), dose dependent, and inhibited at 0 degree C and did not require protein synthesis. Platelet-activating factor so generated was not released but rather retained within the neutrophil, and the molecular species of platelet-activating factor produced was predominantly 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-3-phosphorylcholine. Platelet-activating factor production in LPS-treated neutrophils was also enhanced by PMA, suggesting that receptor-mediated events could not account exclusively for the enhancement. Considering the ability of nanomolar concentrations of exogenously added platelet-activating factor to prime the neutrophil for enhanced release of superoxide, the rapid intracellular accumulation of platelet-activating factor that accompanies stimulation of an LPS-primed cell by FMLP may modulate the secretory events that accompany such stimulation.\r"

  ".U": "88199005\r", 
  ".W": "When polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are exposed to most harvests of influenza A virus (depressing virus, DV) for 20 min, chemotactic, secretory, and oxidative functions are depressed upon subsequent exposure to soluble or particulate stimuli. Other harvests of influenza A virus (non-DV) do not alter these activities. The DV-induced changes in multiple functions suggest the virus may interfere with steps involved in PMN activation. Because some of these steps may be regulated by protein phosphorylation, we examined the effect of non-DV and DV on cellular protein phosphorylation. PMN loaded with 32P-labeled inorganic orthophosphate were exposed to non-DV, DV, or buffer for 30 min; cells were then treated with buffer, FMLP (10(-6) M), or PMA (100 ng/ml) for 30 s. Samples were sonicated and centrifuged; cytosolic and particulate fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Exposure of PMN to either non-DV or DV caused phosphorylation of several cell proteins. However, when DV-treated PMN were then stimulated with FMLP or PMA, further phosphorylation was inhibited compared to non-DV- or buffer-treated cells. This suggests that DV-induced depression of PMN end-stage functions may be due to changes in cell protein phosphorylation. DV could interfere with phosphorylation of PMN proteins by altering protein kinase activity. We therefore examined the influence of non-DV and DV on some parameters that could affect kinase function. PMN intracellular [Ca2+] was monitored by using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, Indo 1, and cAMP levels were measured by RIA. PMN treated with DV alone or DV plus FMLP had higher intracellular [CA2+] than PMN similarly treated with non-DV or buffer. Exposure of PMN to non-DV, DV, or buffer caused minimal changes in cAMP levels, and similar increases occurred in cAMP levels upon FMLP stimulation. To determine whether DV interferes with transmembrane signaling, the effect of influenza virus on PMN transmembrane potential was studied by using a fluorescent cyanine dye. Transmembrane potential changes were greater in PMN exposed to DV than to non-DV or buffer; however, subsequent stimulation with FMLP caused equivalent changes in transmembrane potential. Our data show that protein phosphorylation in PMN is induced by DV and non-DV infection; upon subsequent stimulation with FMLP or PMA, there is inhibited cellular phosphorylation only in PMN previously exposed to DV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Based on previously determined blocks of homology between human chromosome 1 and mouse chromosome 3, it is suggested that the human T11 gene may lie on the short arm of chromosome 1 proximal to p221. Thus, the T11 gene is not linked to any other genes for T cell markers that have been mapped to date.\r"

  ".W": "A cDNA library from LPS-treated murine peritoneal macrophages has been screened by differential hybridization with radiolabeled cDNA from untreated and LPS-treated macrophages. Six clones hybridizing with mRNA sequences present in LPS-treated cells but not in controls were selected for further characterization. When the recombinant bacteriophage DNA from each clone was used as a probe in Northern analysis of total RNA from LPS-treated macrophages, inducible mRNA ranging from 1.45 to 6.4 kb were seen. In five of six cases, the mRNA expression was undetectable in untreated macrophage cultures. All but one clone identified mRNA that were inducible even in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating the independence of such gene expression from protein synthesis; none of the genes were superinduced by this treatment. The time course of expression differed among the individual genes. Four were induced transiently, whereas two showed stable increasing accumulation through an 8-h period after stimulation. In addition, four of the genes were seen within 30 min of stimulation, whereas two were seen only after 2 to 4 h. Two genes were induced only by treatment with LPS, whereas four were also induced in response to other agents, including IFN-gamma, macrophage CSF, and PMA. The insert sequences from these recombinant clones did not hybridize with a set of cDNA encoding other inducible gene products, including TNF, IL-1, ornithine decarboxylase, c-myc, c-fos, JE, or KC. Thus, these six cDNA appear to encode inducible macrophage genes that are distinct from one another as well as from a selection of previously described early genes. Although their functional identity remains indeterminate, they may encode previously described early proteins induced in macrophages treated with LPS.\r"

IgM, IgA, and IgE H chain constant region (CH) genes were isolated with the rabbit S mu probe and three IgG CH genes were isolated with the C gamma probe. The CH genes were individually cloned into an expression vector which contained a murine VDJ gene cloned from a hybridoma producing anti-dansyl hapten antibody. The resulting constructs were transfected into murine hybridoma cells producing L chain of the anti-dansyl antibody and stable transfectomas secreting chimeric bovine-murine IgA, IgE, or IgG subclass anti-dansyl antibodies were obtained. The chimeric antibodies, immunoprecipitated with Ag or with anti-bovine H chain antibodies, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and were shown to contain H and L chains of expected size. Of the three chimeric antibodies derived from the C gamma genes, one reacted with anti-IgG1 antibody, another reacted with anti-IgG2 antibody and the third did not react with either anti-IgG1 or anti-IgG2. This third IgG appears to represent a \"new\" subclass of bovine IgG, IgG3. Southern blot analysis indicated that the bovine genome contains a fourth C gamma gene. These experiments demonstrate the usefulness of molecular genetic techniques for the isolation and characterization of Ig which are not readily purified from biologic fluids. These techniques will be useful for isolation and characterization of Ig genes from other outbred mammals.\r"

In C27 and G3 cells, TNF-alpha as well as IFN-gamma induced changes in steady state levels of specific mRNA, which appear to be associated with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma diverse effects on cell growth and differentiation. Constitutive differences in membrane phosphorylation patterns suggest that altered transduction of TNF-alpha signals may account for the differential response of these three cell lines. Several lines of evidence indicate that C27 and G3 cells, when compared with parental U937 cells represent discretely higher stages of monocytic differentiation, suggesting that cellular differentiation may contribute to the development of resistance to the action of TNF-alpha.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, a protein isolated from the membrane of human E, the so-called C8 binding protein (C8bp), has been described. C8bp is characterized as a 65-kDa protein that binds to C8 and inhibits the C5b-9-mediated lysis in a homologous system. In the present study, membranes of peripheral blood cells were tested for the presence of C8bp by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. In all cells a protein band reacting with anti-C8bp was seen, the Mr, however, was only about 50 kDa. To further analyze the 50-kDa protein, we isolated the protein by phenol-water extraction and isoelectric focusing from papain-treated platelets. The isolated protein behaved similar to the E-derived C8bp: it inhibited the lysis of model target cells by C5b-9. To examine the function of C8bp in platelets, we tested platelets from patients suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). These platelets were deficient in C8bp, being in accordance with their higher lytic susceptibility in vitro. In response to sublytic C5b-9 doses, the PNH platelets released considerably more serotonin and thromboxane B2 than normal platelets. By addition of purified C8bp, the thromboxane B2 release was suppressed, indicating that C8bp not only restricts the lytic complement attack, but also regulates the C5b-9-mediated stimulation of target cells. Thus, lack of C8bp might not only result in enhanced hemolysis, but also in enhanced stimulation of platelets, which in turn might contribute to the thrombotic complications seen in some PNH-type III patients.\r"

  ".W": "mAb to murine C receptor type 1 (CR1) were produced and three of them were characterized. One antibody, designated as 8C12, immunoprecipitated a protein of 190,000 Mr from a detergent extract of surface-labeled spleen cells and stained spleen B but not T lymphocytes in fluorescent flow cytometry. It inhibited both CR1-mediated rosette formation and the cofactor activity of CR1 for factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b, suggesting that it recognizes the ligand-binding site of CR1. The two other antibodies, designated as 7G6 and 7E9, recognized different epitopes from that recognized by 8C12, and they cross-reacted with a protein of 150,000 Mr that is present in a spleen extract. The distribution of CR1 in murine hemopoietic cells was studied by binding experiments with radiolabeled 8C12 and fluorescent flow cytometry. When CR1 was not detected by 8C12 alone, the two other antibodies were used in combination with 8C12 to confirm the negative results. Almost all B lymphocytes from the spleen, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood were CR1 positive. Most of the Thy-1-positive lymphocytes from these tissues were CR1 negative. Thymus lymphocytes were also CR1 negative. Peritoneal macrophages and chemotactic factor stimulated but not unstimulated peripheral blood granulocytes were CR1 positive. In contrast to human E, mouse E were CR1 negative. This pattern of distribution was consistent with previous results obtained by rosette assays. Although mouse platelets cause immune adherence hemagglutination with C3b-bearing SRBC, they are CR1 negative. Three other lines of evidence also indicated that platelets are CR1 negative. First, no band of CR1 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with 8C12 of an extract of surface-labeled platelets. Second, 8C12, which inhibited rosette formation by lymphocytes, alone or in combination with 7G6 and 7E9, did not inhibit immune adherence between platelets and C3b-bearing SRBC. Third, polyclonal rabbit IgG prepared from anti-mouse CR1 antiserum did not inhibit immune adherence by platelets. These results strongly suggest that the C3b-binding factor(s) on mouse platelets is different from CR1 and that processing of C3b-bearing immune complexes in mouse blood may be mediated by a new and as yet unidentified C3b-binding factor(s).\r"

Western blot analysis with 4B4 showed that this mAb binds to the B/B' ribonucleoprotein of the Sm/ribonucleo-protein complex. By competitive inhibition assay, 4B4 was demonstrated to partially share idiotypic expression with a mouse anti-Sm mAb designated Y2. This was demonstrated by the ability of each mAb (Y2 or 4B4) to inhibit a homologous anti-idiotypic antibody (either anti-Y2 or anti-4B4) better than the nonhomologous anti-idiotypic antibody. These results confirm previous findings that idiotypes related to Sm-binding are highly conserved in nature. Furthermore, this report is the first idiotypic analysis of a human anti-Sm mAb.\r"

Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis illustrated multiple diffuse polypeptides ranging from a pI of less than 4.7 to 6.5. Treatment of the purified receptor with neuraminidase shifted the mobility of these polypeptides to a more basic pI, ranging from 6 to 8, illustrating the presence of sialic acid residues on Fc gamma RIII. The glycoprotein nature of Fc gamma RIII was characterized by several criteria. The receptor bound to Con A-Sepharose. Treatment of Fc gamma RIII with endoglycosidase H or F, which cleave high mannose and biantennary complex N-linked oligosaccharides, respectively, failed to alter the electrophoretic mobility of the Fc gamma R. Peptide N:glycosidase F, which cleaves all classes of N-linked oligosaccharides, reduced the Mr of Fc gamma RIII by 60% to reveal two poorly resolved polypeptides centered at Mr 25 kDa and ranging from Mr 16 to 28 kDa. Chemical deglycosylation with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, which cleaves O- and N-linked oligosaccharides except for the asparagine-linked N-acetylglucosamine, reduced the Mr of Fc gamma RIII to 21 to 36 kDa. These results demonstrate that Fc gamma RIII is an acidic complex sialoglycoprotein and suggest that there may be 8 to 15 N-linked oligosaccharide chains on Fc gamma RIII.\r"

In assay buffer alone, 32.0% +/- 2.6 eosinophils adhered spontaneously to endothelial cells. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) at concentrations as low as 10(-9) M increased this adherence to a level of 46.7% +/- 2.0. The effects of PAF were confirmed to be on eosinophils by parallel adherence assays done on serum-coated plastic plates where comparably enhanced adhesion of the eosinophils was seen. Lyso-PAF, the biologically inactive precursor/metabolite of PAF, had no stimulatory properties. FMLP caused an increase in eosinophil adherence, comparable to that of PAF, but only at high concentrations (10(-6) to 10(-7) M). Further examination of eosinophil subpopulations separated on metrizamide gradients indicated that \"hypodense\" eosinophils had a significantly higher ability to adhere spontaneously to endothelial cells than \"normal\" dense eosinophils, (35.5% +/- 4.2 vs 23.8% +/- 2.5, respectively) and could be stimulated with PAF to higher levels, although the magnitude of stimulation was similar for both populations. A mouse mAb TS1/18 to the common beta-subunit of the Mac-1 cell surface glycoprotein complex (CDw18) reduced by up to 94.6% the PAF-induced increase in adherence, but had no effect on the spontaneous adhesion. Eosinophils were also shown by cytofluorography to be capable of binding the TS1/18 antibody on their cell surface, and in some experiments to exhibit an increased expression of the Mac-1 complex on stimulation with PAF. These studies indicate that eosinophils are capable of binding to endothelial cells in culture, that PAF is a potent stimulator of eosinophil adherence, and that the Mac-1 complex has a critical role in this adhesion process.\r"

This clone contained an open reading frame of 1065 bp, encoding a 40.1-kDa polypeptide that corresponded to the carboxyl-terminal end of the La protein. The predicted polypeptide sequence of the recombinant protein was highly charged and unrelated to any previously published sequence. We also compared this clone to a previously published cDNA sequence for La and demonstrated significant differences, particularly that the open reading frame in our cDNA continued for 926 additional bases 3' to a putative termination codon in the previously reported sequence. The recombinant La protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and tested for reactivity with 200 sera containing ANA of various specificities. Only the sera containing anti-La antibodies reacted with the cloned La. By expressing subclones of the La cDNA as fusion proteins with beta-galactosidase, we have localized at least one epitope for the binding of anti-La antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal 103 amino acids of the La protein. No anti-La binding could be demonstrated to the region of the La protein that had previously been predicted to contain an autoepitope for the binding of anti-La (SS-B) antibodies. Studies of cloned autoepitopes could provide important clues to the role ANA play in disease and lead to targeted intervention in the treatment of primary Sjogren's syndrome.\r"

We found that it also activates NK cells and macrophages by induction of IFN production. Culturing spleen cells with 8-BrGuo for 16 to 18 h induced cytotoxic activity to YAC cells. The cytotoxic cells expressed Qa-5, asialo-Gm-1, and NK-1.1 Ag. Similarly, preincubation of peptone-elicited peritoneal macrophages with 8-BrGuo induced macrophage cytolytic activity to P815 cells in an 18-h assay. Anti-IFN antibodies to IFN-alpha -beta and -gamma abolished these inductive events. Furthermore, elimination of asialo-Gm-1+ cells reduced the responses of NK and macrophages to 8-BrGuo, indicating that these cells possibly produce the IFN. We conclude from these observations that one biologic effect of 8-BrGuo is due to IFN production.\r"

  ".W": "Sclerosing or morphea-like variant of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is characterized by an extensive connective tissue stroma, and histopathology has suggested that the extracellular matrix is largely composed of collagen. In addition, fibronectin deposition has been proposed to modulate tumor growth in BCC. In this study, we examined the expression of genes coding for type I, III, and IV procollagens, as well as for fibronectin, in tissue from 10 patients with sclerosing BCC. For comparison, tissues from 5 patients with nodular BCC and 4 controls were examined. Total RNA was isolated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation, and messenger RNA (mRNA) steady-state levels were determined by slot-blot hybridizations with human sequence specific complementary DNAs (cDNAs). The abundance of type I procollagen mRNA in sclerosing BCC tissue was increased to 233.6 +/- 36.7% of the controls (mean +/- SEM). The corresponding value for type III procollagen mRNA in sclerosing BCC was 281.8 +/- 54.8% of the controls. Consequently, the steady-state ratio of type I/III procollagen mRNAs in sclerosing BCCs (5.0 +/- 1.2; mean +/- SD) was within the control range. Thus, there is a coordinate increase in type I and type III procollagen mRNA levels in sclerosing BCC. In contrast, the values for type I and type III procollagen mRNAs in nodular BCC were not different from the controls. In addition, type IV procollagen and fibronectin mRNA levels were not different from the controls either in sclerosing or nodular BCCs, attesting to the selectivity of the increase in type I and III procollagen mRNA levels in sclerosing BCC. These observations may relate to the excessive deposition of the extracellular matrix stroma surrounding the tumor cells in sclerosing BCC.\r"

Although the biochemical basis of the syndrome is unknown, its influence appears to be primarily upon mesodermal tissues. Characteristics such as the altered appearance of the skin and the extensive and fatal involvement of the cardiovascular system led us to study elastin production in cultured skin fibroblasts from three progeroid individuals. We found tropoelastin production by progeroid cells was elevated six- to nine-fold at the protein and mRNA levels, while relative collagen synthesis was similar to control strains. There was little difference between progeroid and normal cells in expression of total protein or in total cellular mRNA content. Western blot analysis of tropoelastin from progeroid fibroblasts confirmed increased production of elastin but revealed no gross changes in the molecular mass. The significant increase in tropoelastin expression lends support to the concept that progeria results from a mesenchymal dysplasia, and offers a possible biochemical marker for the phenotype.\r"

The mechanism of tissue destruction mediated by this modality is poorly understood. In this study, epidermal microsomes incubated in vitro with Photofrin-I (Pf-I) and Photofrin-II (Pf-II) followed by exposure to radiation (approximately 400 nm) resulted in increased (180%) NADPH-supported (enzymatic) as well as ADP/iron-supported (140%) (nonenzymatic) lipid peroxidative damage as measured by malondialdehyde formation. Lipid peroxidation by Pf-I and Pf-II was found to be differentially affected by quenchers of singlet oxygen (2,5-dimethylfuran, histidine, beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, and sodium azide), superoxide anion (superoxide dismutase), and the hydroxyl radical (sodium benzoate, mannitol, and ethanol). Catalase, a quencher of hydrogen peroxide, afforded significant protection only against Pf-II-enhanced lipid peroxidative damage while it had little effect against the Pf-I-mediated reaction. Deuterium oxide, which is known to increase the half-life of singlet oxygen, was found to enhance Pf-I-mediated lipid peroxidation but produced insignificant effects upon Pf-II-mediated photosensitization. Our results indicate that Pf-I and Pf-II, which are employed for the photodynamic therapy of malignant tumors, evoke membrane damage by generating different reactive oxygen species. The Pf-I-mediated photodestruction mainly involves a type II mechanism via singlet oxygen formation, whereas Pf-II-mediated photodestruction preferentially involves a type I mechanism by generating superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals. Our data indicate that tumor necrosis evoked by porphyrins and light is likely due to the generation of reactive oxygen species.\r"

In scleroderma lesions, high levels of pro alpha 1 (I) and pro alpha 1 (III) collagen mRNAs were detected in some but not all fibroblasts, suggesting the presence of a subpopulation responsible for the increased collagen production. The levels of pro alpha 1 (I) and pro alpha 1 (III) collagen mRNAs in these fibroblasts were clearly elevated compared to control skin specimens hybridized at the same time under identical conditions. Most of the scleroderma samples represented intermediate stages where the fibroblasts containing elevated levels of type I and type III procollagen mRNAs were located in the papillary and upper reticular layer of the dermis. One of the scleroderma samples from an early inflammatory stage of the disease was found to contain activated fibroblasts in all dermal layers and also in aggregates adjacent to inflammatory cell infiltrates. In situ analyses were also performed on cell cultures from affected and unaffected skin of one scleroderma patient. These experiments revealed a homogeneous population of activated fibroblasts in cultures producing high levels of collagen. The results suggest that development of fibrosis in scleroderma could evolve through activation of a certain fibroblast subpopulation. During cell culturing, however, cell selection or uncharacterized regulatory mechanisms appear to modulate the behavior of these cells with respect to collagen production.\r"

Microfibrils, as with conventional stains, are electron-dense and clearly visible. This study describes, with the aid of tannic acid, normal hairless mouse elastic fibers and their progressive degeneration with increasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Results with the two staining methods are contrasted. In addition, photodamaged mouse and human elastic fibers are compared for differences and similarities.\r"

Cycloheximide (10(-4) M) inhibited pemphigus antigen expression and stratification but actinomycin D (2 micrograms/ml) had no effect. Tunicamycin, which inhibits dolichol pyrophosphate-mediated glycosylation of asparaginyl residues specifically, was used to study the role of glycosylation. When calcium switching was carried out in the presence of tunicamycin, human keratinocytes did not stratify, and the expression of pemphigus antigen was partially inhibited and limited to cell-cell contact areas. Analysis of biosynthetically labeled proteins showed that the synthesis of high-molecular-weight proteins was markedly reduced in the tunicamycin-treated cells. A reciprocal blocking test demonstrated that concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin receptor share an epitope with pemphigus vulgaris antigen(s). These results suggest that Ca++, newly synthesized protein, and N-asparaginyl glycosylation are required for normal pemphigus antigen expression and epidermal stratification in vitro. Pemphigus vulgaris antigen may have a highly glycosylated, high-molecular-weight protein chain with carbohydrates playing an important role in epidermal cell morphology, adhesion, and stability of cell surface antigens.\r"

Electron microscopic autoradiography revealed that the intracellular localization of 4-S-CP was closely correlated with melanogenesis and that 4-S-CP served as an initial substrate for tyrosinase and was utilized in melanin synthesis. On the basis of these findings we hypothesize that tyrosinase is required for intracellular incorporation of 4-S-CP. This specific incorporation of 4-S-CP into melanoma cells should be useful in the development of an effective procedure for chemotherapy of malignant melanomas and in analysis of melanin synthesis.\r"

Fungal elements were mainly present in the hair cortex and showed a constant morphologic change during the differentiation of hair layers. The fungal elements, located deep in the keratogenous zone of the cortex, showed less electron dense non-septate hyphae. Distally, the hyphae showed septation and contained several scattered dense bodies in the cytoplasm. At the level where the Huxley's layer was keratinized, the fungal elements were transformed into arthrospores, which occupied the large volume of the cortex; each spore was surrounded by a fiber- and melanosome-free, electron lucent halo. Fungal elements occasionally invaded the keratinized hair cuticle and keratinized inner root sheath in a few hair follicles. Fungi do not invade the hair germinative cells. There seems to be a distinct relationship between the morphology of the invading fungi and the cortical cell differentiation in black dot ringworm; a balance between the fungus proliferation and the cortical cell development may be present.\r"

  ".W": "Basement membrane zone gene expression by fibroblast cultures established from adult human skin was examined by molecular hybridizations with human sequence-specific cDNAs corresponding to pro-alpha 1 (IV) chain of type IV collagen and B2 chain of laminin. Northern transfer analysis of poly(A)+RNA isolated from fibroblast cultures clearly revealed the presence of specific mRNA transcripts, indicating the expression of the genes coding for pro-alpha 1 (IV) and laminin B2 polypeptides. Quantitative estimates of the relative levels of these mRNAs coding for basement membrane zone components indicated that they are of relatively low abundance in control fibroblasts, as compared with mRNAs coding for fibronectin or pro-alpha 1 (I) chain of type I procollagen. In fibroblast cultures established from the lesional skin of a 32-year-old patient with lipoid proteinosis, the levels of mRNA coding for pro-alpha 1 (IV) polypeptides were increased approximately 4.5-fold, as compared with age- and passage-matched control cultures. This increase was selective in that the levels of fibronectin, pro-alpha 1 (I), and beta-actin mRNAs were unaltered in the same cultures. The increase in pro-alpha 1 (IV) mRNA level was also uncoordinate with the expression of the laminin B2 chain gene, which was unaltered in lipoid proteinosis. The selective increase in pro-alpha 1 (IV) mRNA may have relevance to the accumulation of this basement membrane component in the skin in lipoid proteinosis.\r"

Growth over the 7-day assay period in the basal medium was age-dependent, with newborn cultures achieving a 10-fold increase in cell number over seeding density, old adult cultures barely maintaining their seeding density and young adult cultures intermediate in proliferative capacity. Maximally stimulatory extract concentration was 5-fold higher for newborn than for adult keratinocytes, with adult cultures experiencing toxicity at doses still growth-promoting for newborn cultures. At optimal extract concentration the maximal average increase in cell yield (66.3% for newborn, 53.6% for young adult, and 18.1% for old) indicated decreased mitogen responsiveness or increased inhibitor sensitivity with increasing donor age. Stimulation of cholera toxin-treated cultures was equally high, ranging from 39.4% to 145.9%, suggesting that the extract acts through a cyclic AMP-independent pathway. Thymic extract did not increase colony forming efficiency. Our findings provide further support for the concept of functional interactions between the skin and the immune system, in addition to the recognized morphologic similarities between thymic cells and keratinocytes. Furthermore, these data confirm earlier findings of an inverse relationship between mitogen responsiveness and donor age for cultured cells.\r"

Laser irradiation (193 nm, 14-ns pulse) at two different radiant exposures, 62 and 156 mJ/cm2 per pulse, was used to ablate the 15-microns-thick stratum corneum of the skin. Light and electron microscopy of immediate biopsies demonstrated damage to fibroblasts as deep as 88 and 220 microns, respectively, below the ablation site. These depths are far in excess of the optical penetration depth of 193-nm light (1/e depth = 1.5 micron). The damage is unlikely to be due to a photochemical mechanism because (a) the photons will not penetrate to these depths, (b) it is a long distance for toxic photoproducts to diffuse, and (c) damage is proportional to laser pulse intensity and not the total dose that accumulates in the residual tissue; therefore, reciprocity does not hold. Damage due to a thermal mechanism is not expected because there is not sufficient energy deposited in the tissue to cause significant heating at such depths. The damage is most likely due to a photoacoustic mechanism because (a) photoacoustic waves can propagate deep into tissue, (b) the depth of damage increases with increasing laser pulse intensity rather than with increasing total residual energy, and (c) the effects are immediate. These effects should be considered in the evaluation of short pulse, high peak power laser-tissue interactions.\r"

Bands at 150 and 35 kDa were also seen in 13 and 11 sera, respectively. Bands to gpI, gpII, and p35 were more intense after zoster than CP. After one dose of LAVV, eight of eight normal children had gpI antibody. In leukemic children, gpI antibody appeared in 18 (56%) after one dose and in 25 (89%) after two doses. Upon household exposure, leukemic vaccinees who developed CP were less likely than those protected to have prior gpIII and p35 antibodies. As seen after zoster, WBs after breakthrough CP showed intense responses to VZV antigens. Thus, WB helps distinguish secondary from primary antibody responses to VZV.\r"

Nine patients had a significant titer increase by Coombs test and IgG ELISA, three had a significant increase by tube and DTT agglutination, none had significant increases by IgM ELISA, and one had no significant increase after relapse.

In vitro studies have suggested that fibronectin may act as an opsonin for the clearance of immune complexes from the blood by binding to C1q and may influence the expression and activation of immune receptors on macrophages. Complement receptor clearance function was assessed in rats from the hepatic uptake of rat erythrocytes coated with antierythrocyte IgM. Increasing plasma fibronectin by the injection of purified fibronectin or decreasing fibronectin by the injection of gelatin had no effect on complement receptor function in otherwise normal animals. Surgical injury depressed both plasma fibronectin levels and complement receptor function. Injection of fibronectin at the time of injury prevented the depression of receptor function; however, when fibronectin was given 1 hour after injury, receptor function remained depressed even though fibronectin levels were increased. The phagocytosis of immune complexes (IgG-coated rat erythrocytes [EIgGs]) depressed complement receptor function but did not depress plasma fibronectin levels. The depression of receptor function caused by the phagocytosis of EIgGs was prevented by administering fibronectin and was potentiated by administering gelatin, which decreased plasma fibronectin levels. Therefore, plasma fibronectin concentrations can influence in vivo Kupffer cell complement receptor function under certain conditions that lead to the depression of complement receptor function.\r"

Studies with purified Hageman factor (factor XII) demonstrate that this inhibitory property is directed against the activation of Hageman factor. In this study beta 2-glycoprotein I inhibited the kaolin-induced generation of clot-promoting properties in solutions of Hageman factor. This effect was localized to an interaction between beta 2-glycoprotein I and kaolin. In contrast, once Hageman factor was activated by kaolin, its clot-promoting properties were not inhibited by beta 2-glycoprotein I. Further, beta 2-glycoprotein inhibited the generation of amidolytic activity against H-D-prolyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride in mixtures of Hageman factor and ellagic acid. The specificity of the action of beta 2-glycoprotein I was confirmed by its neutralization by immunoglobulin fractions of antiserums directed against this protein.\r"

Iron overload is known to increase the virulence of Y. enterocolitica. Whether alterations of the phagocyte defense against this organism are also involved has not yet been determined. We compared neutrophil defense against a serum-resistant strain of Y. enterocolitica in three groups of individuals: nine patients receiving hemodialysis who had iron overload (group 1), nine patients receiving hemodialysis who did not have iron overload (group 2), and 10 healthy controls (group 3). Y. enterocolitica phagocytosis and killing were studied in the presence of autologous or pooled normal human serum. Phagocytosis was significantly decreased in group 1 compared with that in the other two groups. The use of normal serum for opsonization did not improve the phagocytosis function. Killing was moderately decreased in the group 1, but only in the presence of autologous serum. We conclude that in patients with iron overload who are undergoing dialysis, the high frequency of Yersinia bacteremia is attributable not only to increased virulence of this microorganism but also to disturbances of the mechanisms specifically involved in the neutrophil defense against Yersinia invasion.\r"

Significant increases in cardiac output, heart rate, and total body peripheral resistance (shunt resistance excluded), suggesting decreased sinoaortic baroreceptor activity, occurred at shunt fractions greater than 10%. There were no significant changes in plasma concentrations of AVP at any level of AV shunting. In separate studies, significant elevations in plasma AVP levels were observed in vagotomized dogs during AV shunting of 50% of control cardiac output. These results indicate that AV shunting less than or equal to 50% of cardiac output does not acutely alter plasma AVP levels in the intact dog and that cardiopulmonary receptors with vagal afferents suppress AVP release that might otherwise occur in this canine model of AV shunting.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in dogs have demonstrated that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis markedly impairs the ability of the kidney to alter sodium excretion in response to changes in renal perfusion pressure (RPP). The objectives of the present study were to determine whether renal prostaglandins play a role in the urinary sodium excretory response to alterations in RPP in the rat and to determine the role of the proximal tubule in this response. RPP was changed from 127 to 109 mm Hg and then to 91 mm Hg with a servo-controlled cuff on the abdominal aorta. Fractional lithium excretion (FELi) was used as an index of ractional sodium reabsorption by the proximal tubule. As a function of increases in RPP, FELi increased, suggesting that fractional sodium reabsorption by the proximal tubule was decreased in response to increases in RPP in control animals. In meclofenamate-treated rats, increases in fractional sodium excretion and FELi in response to increases in RPP were attenuated compared with levels in control animals. The blunted response of FELi in meclofenamate-treated rats suggests that the attenuated increase in urinary sodium excretion observed during increases in RPP reflects an increase in proximal sodium reabsorption mediated by blockade of renal prostaglandins.\r"

Electrophysiologic studies revealed mildly delayed nerve conduction, decreased amplitudes of sensory action potentials, and sensory delay in the posterior columns. Known causes of similar neurologic disorders were excluded. Although vitamin E deficiency was well documented, intestinal absorption and plasma lipoprotein transport of vitamin E were normal. Incubation studies in vitro failed to identify a plasma factor causing destruction of circulating vitamin E. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of steatorrhea caused by gastrointestinal, hepatic, or pancreatic disease. Plasma lipoproteins, apolipoprotein B, and adipose tissue fatty acid composition were normal. Oral vitamin E therapy restored serum levels to normal and caused neurologic improvement in two patients. We postulate that an inherited defect in hepatocyte secretion of vitamin E into lipoproteins may account for this disorder, which occurs in sporadic cases as well as in siblings.\r"

In experimental mixtures without exogenous antigen, immune sera produced an antigen-like effect. In contrast, in mixtures with a relatively large concentration of exogenous antigen, immune sera obscured antigen activity. In both circumstances, preparing specimens with an acidification-heat extraction procedure before assay rectified serum interference, and only in specimens with no exogenous antigen was the correction incomplete. Other evidence, including direct measurement of anticoccidioidal antibody after extraction, suggested that the residual antigen-like activity was not from persistent antibody. Incorporating the extraction procedure into the ELISA of clinical specimens, we found antigen activity in nine of 15 specimens. We conclude that acidification-heat extraction of sera improves detection of coccidioidal antigens and that coccidioidal antigens are present in some patients with coccidioidal infection.\r"

The effect of rate of infusion and premedication with diphenhydramine, aspirin, and methylprednisolone on acute and delayed reactions was assessed. All patients were monitored for 72 hours after infusion. Two patients reacted to the test dose. One responded with generalized body pain that lasted approximately 5 minutes. In one an anaphylactoid reaction developed, which was promptly terminated by intravenous methylprednisolone, subcutaneous epinephrine, and intravenous diphenhydramine. Transient delayed adverse reactions easily controlled by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs occurred in 37 patients. The most common delayed reaction was a syndrome characterized by arthralgia, myalgia, and fever. Seven subjects had a chronic disease in addition to anemia with absent bone marrow iron. In all seven normal hemoglobin and hematocrit values were attained after treatment. The results of our experience with total dose intravenous iron dextran therapy suggest that it be the preferred method of replenishment in clinical situations where parenteral administration of iron is indicated. An unexpected benefit was the efficaciousness of this method of administration in patients with iron deficiency and coexisting chronic disease. A protocol for its administration is proposed.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the status of the protein C-protein S anticoagulant pathway in sickle cell disease, we measured protein C, total and free protein S, and C4b-binding protein levels in 20 subjects with sickle cell disease (Hb SS or SC). Mean total and free protein S levels were both significantly lower in subjects with sickle cell disease than in normal individuals, but greater reductions were observed for free S. The free protein S level was below the mean -2 SD for normal subjects in 12 subjects with sickle cell disease; the total protein S level was below this level in three subjects. Mean C4b-binding protein levels were normal in subjects with sickle cell disease, both during painful crisis and in the steady state, and no correlation was observed between the levels of C4b-binding protein and free protein S, suggesting that the low free protein S level was not caused by increased levels of C4b-binding protein. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of plasma samples from eight subjects with sickle cell disease showed marked reductions in free protein S, with normal levels of protein S bound to C4b-binding protein. In contrast to the protein S level, mean protein C activity was normal in subjects with sickle cell disease, both during painful crisis and in the steady state. However, the protein C level was below the mean -2 SD for normal subjects on at least one occasion in four subjects with sickle cell disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The DIDS-elicited oxygen radical burst followed the kinetic pattern of other stimuli with a lag period of 20 seconds, reaching a maximum after 12 to 15 minutes. Washing neutrophils that had been pretreated with DIDS did not reverse neutrophil activation. DIDS was found to strongly stimulate lactate production and did not block the efflux of this anion. Cytochalasin B completely abolished the chemiluminescence responses when added before DIDS stimulation. It also inhibited lactate production, however, only in a glucose-containing medium. Modulation of oxygen radical production by DIDS may reveal an additional transductional pathway for neutrophil activation.\r"

  ".W": "Lipocortins, a group of corticosteroid-induced phospholipase-inhibitory proteins, are thought to play a prominent role in the mediation of the anti-inflammatory effects of steroids. The synthesis and release of these proteins may represent a major endogenous mechanism of regulation of extracellular phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity. Because soluble PLA2 activity has been associated with circulatory collapse in hyperphospholipasemic conditions, such as septic shock and pancreatitis, we examined the relationship between circulating PLA2 activity and adrenocortical function. In a prospective study of 10 episodes of septic shock, serum PLA2 and cortisol levels correlated significantly in all survivors (p less than 0.0001), whereas such a correlation was absent in all nonsurvivors (p less than 0.07). No significant correlation of cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or PLA2 and ACTH, was found in any patient, suggesting that the stimulus for cortisol release arises from outside the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. These data suggest that, in human beings, the regulation of soluble PLA2 activity may be mediated by adrenocortical hormones, perhaps through the intermediary action of lipocortins.\r"

  ".W": "Messenger RNA, obtained from post-mortem brain of 10 schizophrenics, five depressed patients and 10 control subjects, was characterised with respect to a number of parameters. It was found that post-mortem delay was not the major factor in determining RNA yield, size (as determined by cDNA synthesis) and biological activity. Biological activity, as determined by in vitro translation in a reticulocyte-lysate system, could be observed using messenger RNA from periods of 0 to 84 hours post-mortem. Two-dimensional gel analysis of the newly-synthesised radiolabelled products obtained from this material revealed several hundred individual species but no consistent degradation of any particular species with post-mortem delay. It is suggested, therefore, that premortem changes are as important as post-mortem changes in determining RNA yield, size and biological activity. Although no consistent difference could be found between patients and controls using any of these parameters, this study confirms that, by isolating messenger RNA from post-mortem human brain, valuable information can be gained on gene expression in psychiatric disorders.\r"

It is concluded that it is blood stained CSF that is important in the diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), and not xanthochromia, and that a normal CT scan (EMI 1010) and the absence of xanthochromia in the CSF do not exclude a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. To diagnose SAH, it may be necessary to perform both investigations; the CT scan as the primary investigation in those patients in whom lumbar puncture is judged to be hazardous; the lumbar puncture as the secondary investigation in those patients with a normal CT scan.\r"

Operations were non-stereotactic (36), stereotactic (6), with double procedures in one case: outcome was better in the non-stereotactic group. On a five-point scale of outcome, 25 of the 33 interviewed patients were placed in the two best categories, as were eight patients of the 11 who were assessed by case records. Adverse effects were reported in 14 cases, but most were not serious. Only one death could definitely be related to operation. Depression, agoraphobia, obsessional neurosis, and certain aspects of schizophrenia all responded well in the majority of cases. Leucotomy should remain available as a treatment of last resort for some intractable psychiatric disorders.\r"

Patients were given a repeat MRI and performed a series of neuropsychological tests. They were classified by the deepest abnormality detectable on scanning. Classifications derived from early and late MRI scanning were significantly correlated. However, measures of neuropsychological outcome showed a strong correlation only with late MRI, and little or no relationship with either early MRI or early CT. Deeper abnormalities detected by late MRI were associated with poorer neuropsychological test performance; late ventricular enlargement was particularly associated with poor outcome. It is concluded that the lesions visualised by MRI are important for neuropsychological outcome, and that functionally significant abnormalities may only be fully apparent on late scanning.\r"

In 58 (83%) of the healthy subjects the reflex could be recorded bilaterally, in eight (11%) subjects no reflex was found on either side, and in four (6%) it was absent in one leg. Simultaneous recordings from the gastrocnemius-soleus showed that TA responses were not caused by volume conduction from that muscle. In the 18 patients with L5 radicular compression the TA reflex was absent on the affected side 13 times (72%) and present bilaterally in the other five cases. If asymmetry of the reflex (unilateral absence) is considered as a test for the presence of L5 radicular compression, the likelihood ratio for a positive test is 12.0, and for a negative test 0.3. The examination of the TA reflex is easily performed and can be useful in the diagnosis of L5 radicular compression.\r"

No side reactions were elicited by Hib CPS; side reactions elicited by the two conjugates were similar and comparable to those reported for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids adsorbed. Hib-TT was the most immunogenic of the three vaccines, eliciting about 10-fold higher antibody levels than Hib CPS; of 28 vaccinees, all had greater than 1.0 microgram Ab/mL serum after immunization with Hib-TT. Increases of Hib CPS antibodies within immunoglobulin classes induced by the three vaccines were, in decreasing order, IgG greater than IgM greater than IgA. Within IgG subclasses, rises in IgG1 Hib CPS antibodies were the most frequent, followed by IgG2; some vaccinees with high postimmunization levels also had rises in IgG3 and one in IgG4. Immunization-induced Hib CPS antibodies were bactericidal. Hib-TT also elicited higher levels of tetanus toxoid antibodies than Hib-TT ads; these tetanus toxoid antibodies neutralized tetanus toxin in vivo.\r"

Their course was characterized by protracted diarrhea, variable degrees of villus atrophy on intestinal biopsy tissue, and negative caloric balance requiring intravenous alimentation for periods varying from 6 to 16 weeks. Dietary management required rigid exclusion of all offending carbohydrates from the diet. Delay in the diagnosis of primary carbohydrate intolerance varied from 2 weeks to 6 months. Complex carbohydrate intolerance may be more common than has been reported, and should be considered in all infants with protracted diarrhea of infancy when there is persistent carbohydrate intolerance.\r"

In each patient, dialysis was begun before 4 weeks of age. A nutritional regimen was designed to attain a daily weight gain appropriate for height age while minimizing the blood urea nitrogen level. A neurodevelopmental evaluation of gross and fine motor, cognitive, language, and psychosocial skills was performed at least every 3 months. At age 1 year, the mean height standard deviation score (SDS) was -1.33 +/- 0.2. Weight for height was greater than 95th percentile in one patient and normal in three. Mean caloric and protein intake were 105 +/- 20 kcal/kg/d (11.4 +/- 2.7 kcal/cm/d) and 2.7 g/kg/d (0.30 +/- 0.11 g/cm/d), respectively. Mean blood urea nitrogen was 53.6 +/- 17.8 mg/dL. Developmentally, three of the patients were functioning in the normal range and one was mildly retarded. However, gross motor skills were delayed in all patients. Although infants with end-stage renal disease are usually severely growth retarded and developmentally delayed, our observations suggest that early nutritional intervention and dialysis can yield improved results.\r"

  ".W": "In four neonates with perinatally lethal osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) who survived for more than 9 days after birth, vascular congestion and acute hemorrhage were found in 10 of 11 parathyroid glands; in one neonate, all four parathyroid glands, including the only gland without acute hemorrhage, contained abundant deposits of stainable iron. One neonate had hypocalcemia, and one had both hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. In four neonates with OI who died within 72 minutes of birth, all 10 parathyroid glands demonstrated were free of hemorrhage and hemosiderin deposition. Only minor foci of acute hemorrhage were seen in three of 170 glands in 113 comparison neonates and infants. We conclude that parathyroid gland hemorrhage is common in perinatally lethal OI with survival beyond the immediate period of birth, and is otherwise rare. We speculate that parathyroid hemorrhage may be related to difficulty in maintaining postnatal calcium homeostasis in the absence of adequate calcium reserves in bone. Acute parathyroid gland hemorrhage causes fluctuations in serum calcium levels that have on occasion proved fatal, and parathyroid hemorrhage may be a proximate cause of death in some neonates with OI.\r"

There were 298 evaluations for sepsis (243 in the first 24 hours of life and 55 between days 2 and 30). Twenty-six of 27 (96%) infants with sepsis and all 23 infants with probable infection had scores greater than or equal to 3, compared with 35 of 248 (14%) noninfected infants. The likelihood of sepsis with score greater than or equal to 3 was 31%, and this value differed with both gestational and postnatal ages (34% vs 8% in preterm and term infants less than 24 hours of age, and 65% thereafter). The higher the score the greater was the likelihood of sepsis. With score less than or equal to 2 the likelihood that sepsis was absent was 99%. The hematologic scoring system should improve the diagnostic accuracy of the complete blood cell count as a screening test for sepsis and could simplify and standardize the interpretation of this global test.\r"

Pulsatility was calculated from flow velocities and used as an estimate of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Ductal closure was associated with a rise in mean blood pressure from 45.0 +/- 4.2 to 51.3 +/- 6.5 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) and a significant decrease in pulsatility in all three vessels (mean = 0.77 +/- 0.07 vs 0.70 +/- 0.05 (P less than 0.02]. Changes in pulsatility were correlated with changes in mean blood pressure (P less than 0.02), providing evidence that systemic blood pressure may influence postnatal cerebral arterial pulsatility indices. We also noted significant differences in the velocity and pulsatility of individual vessels that were independent of blood pressure, suggesting that Doppler flow studies may be useful in describing regional CBF patterns. The temporal association between ductal closure and decreased pulsatility suggests that CBFV patterns reflect ductal shunting in normal term newborn infants. Diastolic runoff and reduced systemic blood pressure in the presence of ductal shunting appear to reduce diastolic flow velocity and increase CBFV pulsatility in normal term infants during the first days of life. Normal mechanisms of cerebral autoregulation compensate for decreased flow with vasodilation; therefore the increased pulsatility associated with ductal shunting may be due to diastolic runoff rather than increased cerebrovascular resistance.\r"

  ".W": "The passive compliance of the total respiratory system (CRS) was measured by the occlusion technique in 34 preterm newborn infants with respiratory distress syndrome. Gestational age ranged from 27 to 33 weeks. Preterm newborn infants were divided into four groups on the basis of clinical criteria. Group 1 consisted of 10 infants tested during the first postnatal days (1 to 3 days) while acutely ill and requiring ventilation and oxygen therapy. After the acute phase of respiratory distress syndrome, two groups were tested: group 2 consisted of nine infants (5 to 22 days of age) who no longer required ventilation, and group 3 consisted of six infants (7 to 28 days of age) who subsequently had bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Group 4 consisted of nine infants older than 1 month of age with confirmed bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Group 1 had significantly lower CRS and CRS normalized for body weight (CRS/BW) than group 2 had (P less than 0.001). In groups 3 and 4 CRS was significantly lower than in group 2 (P less than 0.001), as was CRS/BW (P less than 0.001). There was no significant difference in CRS and CRS/BW values between groups 3 and 4. This cross-sectional study in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome suggests that CRS may have predictive value in regard to development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia after the acute phase of respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "As a test of the hypothesis that hyperoxia might hinder the growth of nascent lung macrophages, term newborn rabbits were treated with room air or increasing oxygen concentrations (40%, 80%, or greater than or equal to 95%) for 96 hours after birth. After 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours of environmental exposure, pulmonary alveolar macrophage population kinetics were determined by three methods: (1) bronchoalveolar lavage cell yields, (2) thymidine incorporation by macrophages, and (3) assessment of macrophage cell division by mitotic indices. Newborn rabbits kept in room air or 40% inspired O2 showed a steady increase of macrophages in lung lavage, but pups treated with 80% or greater than or equal to 95% oxygen showed no rise of macrophage yield in lung washings after 96 hours of exposure (P less than 0.02). The diminished macrophage yield noted in pups treated with 80% or greater than or equal to 95% oxygen was explained by rates of thymidine uptake and macrophages replication (mitotic indices) that were greater than 12-fold lower than values seen in rabbit pups housed in room air or 40% inspired O2 for 96 hours (P less than 0.05). These findings could not be attributed to malnutrition caused by oxygen toxicity because all groups appeared well and gained weight equally during the period of exposure. We conclude that acute hyperoxia impedes the intraalveolar proliferation of lung macrophages, an observation that may have implications regarding host defense and for repair and growth of the lung in neonates needing respiratory support.\r"

  ".W": "In a retrospective cohort study we reviewed our experience using D-penicillamine in children with low-level lead poisoning (whole blood lead levels 25 to 40 micrograms/dL) to determine its efficacy and the incidence of side effects. Two groups were compared: treated subjects (n = 84) were treated with penicillamine at a mean daily dose of 27.5 mg/kg; control subjects (n = 37) received no chelation therapy. Over a prechelation observation period of 60 days, lead levels (PbB) did not change in either group. With a mean period of 76 days of D-penicillamine therapy, PbB fell in treated patients by 33% (P less than 0.001). In 64 patients (76%), PbB was reduced to a currently acceptable range (less than or equal to 25 micrograms/dL). There were eight treatment failures (10%). In control subjects, mean PbB did not change significantly over 119 days of observation. Fourteen control subjects eventually required conventional chelation with calcium disodium ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid, and 17 were lost to follow-up. Use of D-penicillamine was associated with an adverse reaction in 28 cases (33%); transient leukopenia occurred in eight, rash in seven, transient platelet count depression in seven, enuresis in three, and abdominal pain in two. Treatment was terminated prematurely in eight cases (10%) because of an adverse reaction. We conclude that D-penicillamine is effective therapy for selected children with low-level plumbism, but adverse effects can complicate or prevent its use in some patients.\r"

Hirsutism decreased in four patients, did not change in nine, and increased in one. Of the 10 patients with irregular menses, only three developed regular cycles while taking dexamethasone. During long-term dexamethasone therapy, serum levels of testosterone decreased from 102 +/- 22 to 72 +/- 27 ng/dL, free testosterone from 35 +/- 11 to 19 +/- 8 pg/mL, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate from 396 +/- 138 to 171 +/- 101 micrograms/dL. Although free testosterone decreased to less than 15 pg/mL in eight of 14 patients with the suppression test, only four patients had free testosterone levels less than 15 pg/mL during therapy. Two of the 14 patients have had no recurrence of hirsutism or increase in serum androgens after 28 and 29 months, respectively, after dexamethasone therapy was discontinued. Oral contraceptives were given to nine patients inadequately responsive to bedtime dexamethasone therapy. The mean percent decrease of testosterone and free testosterone levels during oral contraceptive therapy was significantly greater than during long-term treatment with dexamethasone, and hirsutism lessened in all. We conclude that a single bedtime dose of dexamethasone is satisfactory only in patients who maintain serum free testosterone values less than 15 pg/mL without side effects. For other patients, either another glucocorticoid or, in most cases, ovulation suppression should be prescribed for adolescents with progressive hirsutism and elevated androgen levels.\r"

Cai were determined using fura-2, a fluorescent Ca indicator. Halothane (3-6 mM), diethylether (100 mM) and n-alkanols (ethanol, butanol, pentanol and hexanol) increased resting Cai by 20 to 70%. Pentobarbital did not alter resting Cai when examined over a wide range of concentrations (0.01-1 mM). The ability of the anesthetics to increase resting Cai was correlated with their membrane fluidizing actions. Depolarization of synaptosomes by the addition of 50 mM KCI increased Cai by about 25%. The values of Cai measured after depolarization were reduced by diethylether (10-50 mM) and pentobarbital (0.05-1 mm) but were increased or unaltered by halothane and n-alkanols, respectively. All anesthetic agents tested except halothane reduced the net depolarization-dependent increase in Cai. These results provide a mechanism for anesthetic-induced neuronal hyperpolarization and predict effects of these agents on neurotransmitter release.\r"

Intracerebral injections of [gamma-32P]ATP proved to be an effective in vivo method to prelabel brain phospholipids, especially the polyphosphoinositides. High acute doses of ethanol (8 or 6 g/kg b.wt.) administered by gavage significantly inhibited the breakdown of polyphosphoinositides as judged by an elevation in the concentration as well as the labeling of these compounds. Concomitantly, there was a significant reduction in the level of diacylglycerols. Low acute doses of ethanol (2 g/kg b.wt.) did not seem to have any effects on the basal levels or labeling of these compounds. The changes in polyphosphoinositide labeling due to ethanol intoxication were reverted to near control values when animals regained their righting reflex (approximately 4 hr). These studies demonstrate that, under normal conditions, polyphosphoinositides and diacylglycerols are maintained in a dynamic equilibrium and that acute doses of ethanol can suppress the signal transduction process and disturb this equilibrium.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an autacoid whose cardiovascular actions include a potent negative inotropic effect. The mechanism of this decrease in myocardial contractility is still at issue, as both a decrease and an increase in trans-sarcolemmal Ca++ influx have been reported. Because changes in intracellular sodium activity (aiNa) are known to influence myocardial contractility, we investigated whether PAF affects aiNa. Thus, we have measured contractile responses to PAF (1 nM-1 microM) in isolated guinea pig right ventricular papillary muscles paced at constant rate, and recorded transmembrane action potential and aiNa with conventional and sodium-selective microelectrodes, respectively. Our findings suggest that PAF does not affect slow inward Ca++ current, because PAF neither affected nor prevented histamine-induced restoration of contractile responses in K+-depolarized papillary muscles. On the other hand, we found the negative inotropic effect of PAF to be associated with a shortening of the action potential duration and with a decrease in aiNa. The specific PAF antagonist compound CV-3988 inhibited all three electro-mechanical responses. Our findings imply that the decrease in contractile force caused by PAF may depend on the reduction in aiNa; as aiNa falls, intracellular Ca++ may be lost via the Na+/Ca++ exchange and contractility decreases. The shortening of the action potential duration by PAF may reflect a decrease in Na+ influx and the consequent reduction in aiNa.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of 5 mM ethanol, maintained by a constant infusion, on the hepatotoxicity and disposition of acetaminophen was examined in 3-methylcholanthrene-induced rats. Ethanol infusion, which began 1 hr before acetaminophen and was maintained for 9 hr, resulted in a 2.8-fold higher hepatic glutathione concentration 6 hr after acetaminophen than did saline infusion. Ethanol infusion also diminished the rise in the 24 hr postacetaminophen plasma alanine transferase concentration by approximately 46%. Ethanol (5 mM) had only a modest effect on the oxidation of acetaminophen in rat liver microsomes, 7 to 14% inhibition over a range of acetaminophen concentration of 0.1 to 3 mM, whereas a 30 to 40% decline of covalent binding of acetaminophen-derived material was observed in vivo (peak acetaminophen concentration approximately 3 mM). Thus, a mechanism other than direct inhibition of cytochrome(s) P-450 by ethanol is invoked to account for the protective effect of ethanol. Ethanol infusion increased the ratio of total hepatocellular NADH/NAD+, and the ratio of free NADH/NAD+ in cytosol and mitochondria as a consequence of sequential oxidations of ethanol producing acetaldehyde and acetic acid in the respective compartments. The toxic electrophile produced by cytochrome P-450 oxidation of acetaminophen, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine, is reduced rapidly by NADH in aqueous solution. However, acetaminophen alone also increased free NADH/NAD+ in cytosol, and there was no indication that N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine consumed NADH generated by the oxidation of ethanol. Ethanol infusion also increased the ratio of total hepatocellular NADPH/NADP+, apparently through transhydrogenation of NADP+ by NADH in mitochondria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The analgesic effects of i.c.v. administered morphine were equivalent in the CRS-CD1 (Swiss) standard laboratory mice and the progenitor strains of CXBK. Morphine did not, however, produce analgesia in the CXBK mice at doses greater than 10 times the ED50 dose in the progenitor strains. Similarly, the analgesic effect of i.c.v. [D-Ala2, NMePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin, a highly selective mu receptor peptide agonist, also was reduced greatly in the CXBK mice. These data are consistent with the deficiency in mu opioid receptors observed autoradiographically in this strain. In contrast, the highly selective delta opioid receptor peptide agonist [D-Pen2, L-Pen5]enkephalin was equipotent i.c.v. in the CXBK mice and in the progenitor strains of CXBK. In contrast to the effects produced by i.c.v. administration, the analgesic effects of intrathecally administered morphine were similar between CRS-CD1 and CXBX strains of mice. These results suggest that 1) both mu and delta opioid receptors can mediate supraspinal analgesia and 2) that the receptor(s) involved in spinally mediated analgesia is (are) quite distinct from those involved supraspinally.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty rats were trained to discriminate the centrally acting beta adrenergic agonist clenbuterol (0.1 mg/kg) from saline using a water-reinforced (fixed-ratio 10 schedule) two-lever operant task. Discrimination acquisition required a mean +/- S.E.M. of 42 +/- 7 training sessions (median of 26 training sessions). The clenbuterol stimulus was dose-dependent (ED50 = 0.03 mg/kg) and stereoselective, and had a rapid onset (5 min) and a duration of approximately 1 hr. The beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol fully antagonized the clenbuterol discriminative stimulus (IC50 = 0.18 mg/kg). Other beta adrenergic agonists such as SOM 1122 (ED50 = 0.01 mg/kg), zinterol (ED50 = 0.03 mg/kg), salbutamol (ED50 = 0.23 mg/kg) and prenalterol (ED50 = 1.91 mg/kg) substituted for clenbuterol. The monoamine uptake inhibitor despiramine (ED50 = 2.25 mg/kg), the psychomotor stimulants amphetamine (ED50 = 0.33 mg/kg) and pentylenetetrazol (ED50 = 0.31 mg/kg), and the dopamine receptor antagonists haloperidol (ED50 = 0.08 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (ED50 = 2.32 mg/kg) similarly substituted for clenbuterol. However, chlordiazepoxide, pentobarbital, fentanyl, cocaine and fenfluramine produced little or no clenbuterol lever selection up to doses that decreased response rate markedly. The ability of SOM 1122, zinterol, salbutamol, despiramine, amphetamine, pentylenetetrazol and haloperiol to substitute for the clenbuterol stimulus was antagonized by prior treatment with propranolol. Taken together, these results suggest that the discriminative stimulus properties of clenbuterol are mediated, at least in part, through an interaction with beta adrenergic receptors. The same drugs also were assayed for in vitro inhibition of [125I]iodopindolol binding to beta adrenergic receptor preparations of rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rats were trained to discriminate an injection of fentanyl, 0.04 mg/kg, from saline using a two-lever choice procedure with food as a reinforcer. Given acutely, morphine substituted for fentanyl and was 100-times less potent. Subsequently, training was stopped, and fentanyl, 0.08 mg/kg, was injected every 12 hr for 1 week. This procedure did not produce tolerance nor did tolerance occur when fentanyl, 0.16 mg/kg every 24 hr, was continued for an additional week. In contrast, a dose of morphine (8.0 mg/kg) that was equated for efficacy to the 0.08-mg/kg dose of fentanyl produced both tolerance to the morphine stimulus and cross-tolerance to the fentanyl stimulus after 3 to 4 days of administration. In an additional experiment, the time course for detection of fentanyl was found to be significantly shorter than the time course for the detection of morphine. These results suggest that the present, as well as a previous, report of failure to find tolerance to the stimulus properties of fentanyl is perhaps attributable to fentanyl's brief duration of action. To test this hypothesis, 16 rats were trained to discriminate fentanyl, 0.04 mg/kg, and dose-effect data were obtained for the generalization of fentanyl and the substitution of morphine for this discriminative stimulus. Subsequently, training was stopped and fentanyl was injected for 4 days in a design that called for injection of 0.12 mg/kg every 6 hr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Acute effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) were assessed using a battery of food-reinforced complex operant tasks that included responding under delayed matching to sample (DMTS, n = 6), conditioned position response (CPR, n = 8) progressive ratio (PR, n = 8), temporal response differentiation (TRD, n = 3) and incremental repeated acquisition (IRA, n = 9) tasks. THC (0.003-0.3 mg/kg i.v.) given 15-min presession produced dose-dependent decreases in the number of reinforcers obtained in each task. TRD accuracy was decreased significantly at doses as low as 0.03 mg/kg, making TRD accuracy the most sensitive parameter measured. For PR, the break-point (number of responses emitted for the last reinforcer earned) was decreased significantly only at 0.3 mg/kg. Significant disruptions of performance in schedules other than PR were evident at doses of 0.1 mg/kg and above: response rates decreased or latencies to respond increased. Accuracy of responding was not altered in the IRA, DMTS or CPR tests at doses less than those that decreased response rates. The relative sensitivities of these tests for detecting THC behavioral effects were thus TRD greater than IRA = DMTS = CPR greater than PR. These results indicate that THC, at doses that produce plasma levels similar to those noted in humans after marijuana smoke exposure, produce acute behavioral effects on temporal differentiation in monkeys analogous to some effects reported in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The s.c. administration of morphine (2.5-80 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent hyperglycemia, whereas morphine (12.5-50 micrograms) given i.t. in the lumbar region caused a dose-dependent hypoglycemia in unanesthetized mice. Both effects on blood glucose were antagonized by s.c. naloxone, although inhibition of i.t. morphine required a higher naloxone dose. Naloxone pretreatment with 2 mg/kg, but not 1 mg/kg s.c., potentiated a hyperglycemic response to i.t. saline. High i.t. doses of morphine caused an early (within 2 min) scratching behavior that was not inhibited by naloxone or glucose loading and a later (greater than 20 min) tonic convulsive behavior (opisthotonus). Lethality was partially inhibited by glucose loading which delayed, but did not prevent, the hypoglycemic effect of i.t. morphine. The hypoglycemic effect of i.t. morphine was also delayed in streptozotocin-diabetic ICR mice and diabetic (db/db) C57BL/KsJ mice, but the latter were more sensitive to lethality, which occurred without hypoglycemia or seizures. All these effects of i.t. morphine were completely blocked by acute spinal transection of T10-T11, but the nociceptive, hypoglycemic and opisthotonic effects were not mimicked by i.c.v. morphine (6.25-50 micrograms) in ICR mice, which showed a bell-shaped hyperglycemic dose-response relationship and a brief explosive motor behavior at the higher doses (25-50 micrograms). It is concluded that the effects of morphine on blood glucose and on behavior are dependent upon the route of administration, and that the convulsive effect of i.t. morphine may be facilitated by the production of a profound hypoglycemia, which involves a spinal, rather than supraspinal or systemic, action of morphine.\r"

In humans, however, SK&F 101926 was a potent full antidiuretic agonist. This agonist response was not predicted by in vitro studies with human tissue. The purpose of the present study was to determine if the agonist activity of SK&F 101926 could be modeled in an old-world primate, the rhesus monkey, and, if agonist activity was demonstrated, to determine how SK&F 101926 could be modified to reduce agonist activity and permit the elaboration of antagonist activity in that species. We observed that i.v. administration of SK&F 101926 to the hydrated rhesus monkey resulted in a full antidiuretic agonist response, as observed in humans, and did not reduce urine osmolality or increase urine flow when administered to hydropenic rhesus monkeys. Changing the terminal amino acids from Pro7, Arg8 to Arg7, D-Arg8 produced a compound (SK&F 104146) that was also an agonist, although less potent than SK&F 101926. Further substitution in SK&F 104146 of the sulfide groups of cysteine residues with methyl groups in the peptide ring to produce a \"dicarba bridge\" resulted in a compound (SK&F 105494) that was associated with minimal agonist activity in hydrated monkeys. Administration of SK&F 105494 (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) reduced urine osmolality from 629 +/- 20 to 91 +/- 7 mosmol/kg H2O (P less than .01) and increased free water clearance to positive levels (from -0.16 +/- 0.03 to 0.73 +/- 0.18 ml/min; P less than .05) in anesthetized hydropenic monkeys.\r"

Phenytoin has been proposed as a prophylaxis and treatment of these dysrhythmias, since it is thought to improve conduction in this setting. Anesthetized dogs were given a loading dose of phenytoin, followed by constant amitriptyline infusion until death. Variables known to affect TCA toxicity, such as arterial pH, were carefully controlled. There were no significant differences between the phenytoin and control group in any physiologic parameter, including toxicity, drug levels, or dose to death. However, duration and frequency of episodes of ventricular tachycardia were dramatically increased in the phenytoin group. It is concluded that prophylactic phenytoin in this animal model provides no benefits and may in fact increase the severity of ventricular tachycardia and hypotension. In addition, it is speculated that similar adverse effects of phenytoin might be seen in other Type IA antiarrhythmics if the extremely toxic levels seen in this study with TCA were reached.\r"

Left circumflex coronary artery blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter, whereas myocardial arteriovenous oxygen difference was determined with indwelling aortic and coronary sinus catheters. During control conditions, coronary blood flow, arteriovenous oxygen extraction and myocardial oxygen consumption increased regularly with exercise. Both prazosin and indoramin decreased arterial pressure at rest and during exercise, but during heavier levels of exercise blood pressure was lower and heart rates were higher after prazosin. Prazosin did not alter myocardial oxygen consumption, whereas indoramin tended to decrease oxygen consumption; myocardial oxygen consumption was significantly less after indoramin than after prazosin during the heaviest levels of exercise. Prazosin, but not indoramin, significantly decreased coronary vascular resistance both at rest and during exercise, and blunted the decrease in coronary sinus oxygen tension which occurred during exercise. In comparison with prazosin, during heavy exercise coronary blood flow was significantly decreased, myocardial oxygen extraction significantly increased and myocardial oxygen consumption significantly decreased after indoramin.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of pretreatment with naloxonazine on opioid-mediated antinociception against a thermal stimulus (55 degrees C warm-water tail-flick test) and inhibition of gastrointestinal transit at supraspinal and spinal levels was studied in unanesthetized mice. The mu-selective agonist [D-Ala2, N-methyl-Phe4, Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAGO), the delta-selective agonist [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE) and the reference mu-acting agonist morphine, all produced antinociception after either i.c.v. or intrathecal(ly) (i.t.) administration. Morphine and DAGO, but not DPDPE, inhibited gastrointestinal transit after i.c.v. administration, whereas all three agonists slowed gut propulsion when given i.t. A single s.c. naloxonazine pretreatment, 35 mg/kg given 24 hr earlier, failed to displace the dose-response line for i.c.v. DPDPE antinociception but produced a marked rightward displacement of the i.c.v. morphine and DAGO dose-response lines for antinociception. In contrast, naloxonazine (35 mg/kg) pretreatment did not alter the antinociceptive effects of i.t. morphine, DAGO or DPDPE. The effects of naloxonazine pretreatment on inhibition of gut propulsion were the converse of those observed for antinociception at supraspinal and spinal sites; naloxonazine had no effect on the antitransit properties of i.c.v. morphine and DAGO but inhibited the antitransit properties of all three agonists when they were given i.t. These results support the view that opioids may produce their supraspinal antitransit effects at a receptor different from that mediating antinociception; morphine and DAGO mediate their antitransit effects at a naloxonazine-insensitive site, whereas their antinociceptive effects are produced at the naloxonazine-sensitive receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

NE content was determined by either a catechol-O-methyltransferase-based radioenzymatic assay or high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Regardless of the age of the animal, NE content per gram of tissue was significantly greater in mesenteric arteries and kidneys from SHR compared to WKY tissues, whereas NE content per whole kidney was similar between the two rat strains. The time course of enhanced NE content in caudal arteries and aortas from SHR followed the development of hypertension. In the spleen, NE content per gram of tissue was elevated in young SHR; however, in adult rats NE content was not significantly different between the two rat strains. Because spleens from WKY rats were substantially larger, total NE content per spleen was significantly greater in tissues from WKY rats. Cardiac contents of NE were similar in SHR and WKY rats at all ages examined. Adrenal epinephrine concentrations were similar in SHR and WKY rats, whereas NE content was elevated in the SHR at 46 and 81 days of age. The results of the present study demonstrate that the appearance of increased NE levels in some SHR tissues occurs before the development of hypertension in this model. If NE content is a valid index of sympathetic innervation, enhanced innervation may contribute to the vascular medial hypertrophy observed in young SHR and the elevation of blood pressure in these rats.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists can modulate sympathetic nerve release of norepinephrine in vivo through blockade of peripheral prejunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors, acute and chronic effects of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan on mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate and plasma catecholamine concentrations have been investigated in conscious and anesthetized rats. In normotensive rats, a single i.v. dose of idazoxan (300 micrograms kg-1) caused an immediate 2-fold increase in plasma concentration of norepinephrine and epinephrine, a transient increase in heart rate but no significant change in MAP. Plasma norepinephrine concentration of conscious normotensive rats increased significantly during a 4-hr i.v. infusion of idazoxan (300 micrograms kg-1 hr-1) with no concomitant changes in MAP or heart rate. In anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats, the increases in plasma norepinephrine concentration and heart rate caused by i.v. idazoxan (300 micrograms kg-1) were accompanied by a significant decrease in MAP. The increase in plasma norepinephrine after idazoxan in spontaneously hypertensive rats was much greater than that produced by an equihypotensive dose of the vasodilator hydralazine. Normotensive rats treated continuously for 7 days with s.c. idazoxan (7.5 mg kg-1 day-1) had similar blood pressures and plasma catecholamine concentrations to vehicle-treated rats. These results suggest that idazoxan causes a greater increase in plasma norepinephrine concentration than that which can be attributed to baroreceptor stimulation. Blockade of prejunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors by idazoxan may, therefore, increase release of norepinephrine from peripheral sympathetic nerves of anesthetized and conscious rats. This effect is short-lived and does not influence blood pressure of normotensive rats.\r"

  ".W": "Relaxations of the isolated bovine retractor penis muscle elicited by nicotine and the three other nicotinic agonists acetylcholine, carbachol, and dimethylphenylpiperazinium were studied. Nicotine (10-45 microM) induced dose-dependent relaxations that closely resembled those evoked by transmural stimulation of inhibitory nerves. The relaxations induced by this dose level of nicotine were abruptly abolished by hypoxia and totally blocked by 1.2 microM mecamylamine, 45 microM lidocaine, and 13 microM methylene blue. They were reduced 50-90% by 0.16 microM tetrodotoxin, but they were unaffected by 17 microM scopolamine. Provided that sufficient concentrations of scopolamine and eserine were present, the relaxations caused by acetylcholine (30-140 microM) were exactly like those evoked by nicotine, and they were identically affected by hypoxia and the blocking drugs. Also carbachol and dimethylphenylpiperazinium induced relaxations qualitatively identical to those effected by the above-mentioned doses of nicotine. Relaxations induced by larger doses of nicotine were less susceptible to hypoxia and the blocking drugs. The results suggest that nicotine concentrations ranging from about 10-45 microM relax the bovine retractor penis muscle by a rather selective activation of inhibitory nerves, whereas higher concentrations may additionally activate some other less specific inhibitory mechanism. They further strongly suggest the presence of nerve cell bodies in this muscle. It is suggested that one physiological role of acetylcholine in the development of penile erection is nicotinic activation of inhibitory nerves. Moreover, nicotinic activation of these nerves of the bovine retractor penis muscle can be used as a model for further characterization of mammalian erectile nerves.\r"

Four minutes after each p.o. dose, a tracer dose of [14C]SAM was given i.v. to determine clearance and bioavailability. Over the dosage range studied pretransposition, 5 to 40 mg/kg, bioavailability increased from 0.24 +/- 0.14 (mean +/- S.D.) to 0.76 +/- 0.20 (P less than .05). Clearance decreased from 3.4 +/- 1.0 to 0.6 +/- 0.11 liter/min (P less than .01) and half-life increased from 5.0 +/- 1.2 to 23.5 +/- 6.1 min (P less than .01). Over the dosage range studied post-transposition, 1.5 to 20 mg/kg, bioavailability increased from 0.31 +/- 0.09 to 0.99 +/- 0.08. Clearance and half-life had the same values and showed the same dose-dependence as in the normal dogs. The amount of SAM removed by the intestine during first-pass remained constant at about 1 mg/kg over the dose range given to the post-transposition animals. Therefore, although more easily saturable than the liver, the intestine plays an important role in first-pass metabolism of low p.o. doses of SAM. In contrast to previous results in the normal dog, the p.o. coadministration of sodium sulfate did not reduce the bioavailability of SAM in transposed dogs. This indicates that the nonlinear intestinal first-pass metabolism of SAM is not due to the depletion of the cosubstrate precursor, inorganic sulfate.\r"

Cell cycle progression was initiated by incubating the G1-enriched cells with fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and analyzed in the presence of 40 nM colcemid to block renewal of the cycle. When progression of control cells was analyzed under these conditions, time-dependent decrease in the number of G1 phase cells and increase in that of G2/M phase cells were observed during the 24-hr incubation. Cells in S phase increased transiently during this period. Proportions of cells in G1 and G2/M phases were 65 and 15% of the total cells at 0 hr and 10 and 80% at 24 hr, respectively. When the cells were treated with either PGA2 or 9-deoxy-delta 9,12-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin D2 (delta 12-PGJ2) for more than 3 hr, inhibition of G1 phase progression became evident 3 to 6 hr after the PG addition. Progression through S phase was slowed but not arrested with the PG treatment. When cells treated with PGA2 were washed and transferred to fresh medium, G1 phase progression was resumed and transition to S phase was observed about 6 hr after the wash. However, the arrest by delta 12-PGJ2 was irreversible and no recovery was observed with washing of the cells treated with this PG. The sensitivities of cells to PG in different phases of cell cycle were compared by treating G2/M phase cells with delta 12-PGJ2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The stimulation of cyclic AMP formation induced by excitatory amino acids in guinea pig hippocampal slices was absolutely dependent on the presence of Cl- in the incubation medium. The apparent half-maximal concentration of chloride was about 30 to 40 mM with the maximum response at more than 60 mM. As regards to the anion selectivity for the stimulation by excitatory amino acids, Br- was fully effective as Cl-, whereas F- and SO42- were ineffective. DL-(+/-)-2-Amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid, an antagonist of excitatory amino acid receptors, reduced significantly the response to excitatory amino acids. In the Cl- -free medium, the stimulatory effects of 50 microM veratridine, 10 microM forskolin and 100 microM histamine were reduced markedly but still significantly observed. The anion exchange blockers at the concentrations of more than 1 mM reduced significantly the cyclic AMP formation induced by an excitatory amino acid in a dose-dependent manner. Furosemide at the concentration of 3 mM negated the Cl- -dependent responses to forskolin and histamine without affecting the Cl- -independent ones. Furosemide did not inhibit the adenylate cyclase activity of hippocampal synaptic membrane fractions.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of MCl-176 [2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenylmethyl)-3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-6- isopropoxy-4(3H)-quinazolinone hydrochloride], a novel calcium channel blocker, on ischemic myocardial acidosis was studied in the dog heart, in which the left anterior descending coronary artery was partially occluded for 90 min (partial occlusion). Myocardial pH (measured by a micro glass pH electrode) was about 7.60 in the nonischemic normal heart. The myocardial pH decreased rapidly in response to partial occlusion, and reached the steady state of about 6.85 within 30 min (i.e., the myocardial [H+] increased after partial occlusion). Saline or drug was injected i.v. 30 min after partial occlusion, and the drug effect was observed till the end of partial occlusion. Myocardial [H+], that had been increased by partial occlusion, restored slightly after the saline injection, and the restoration was about 30% 60 min after the injection. MCl-176 increased this spontaneous restoration of myocardial [H+] with a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate; the restoration induced by 0.1 mg/kg of MCl-176 was 74% 60 min after the injection. Even in the paced heart, MCl-176 (0.1 mg/kg) attenuated the ischemia-induced myocardial acidosis. Propranolol (1 mg/kg) also attenuated the myocardial acidosis, the restoration being 82%. These results indicate that MCl-176 attenuates the myocardial acidosis during ischemia as does propranolol, and that the mechanism of action of MCl-176 is not due primarily to a decrease in heart rate.\r"

Antinociception was determined 1 or 1.5 hr after each injection using the tail-flick and paw-pressure tests. Complete tolerance to i.t. morphine and oxymetazoline developed within 72 and 24 hr, respectively. Antinociception after i.t. oxymetazoline (100 nmol) in morphine-tolerant rats, and after i.t. morphine (20 nmol) in oxymetazoline-tolerant rats, was not significantly different from their respective effects in saline-pretreated rats. These data suggest an absence of cross-tolerance between morphine and oxymetazoline in the rat spinal cord. In a separate group of rats, the continuous i.t. infusion of morphine (26 nmol/hr) produced significant antinociception; tolerance to morphine developed within 36 hr. The antinociceptive effect of i.t. oxymetazoline (100 nmol) was significantly attenuated in rats pretreated with continuous i.t. morphine as compared to saline-pretreated rats. In rats pretreated with continuous i.t. oxymetazoline, cross-tolerance to morphine could not be determined due to severe adverse effects during oxymetazoline infusion. The results of this study suggest that functional cross-tolerance between morphine and alpha adrenoceptor agonists in the spinal cord cannot be excluded on the basis of repeated i.t. injection experiments alone.\r"

  ".W": "Upon differentiation with retinoic acid of the human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y into mature neurons, opioid drugs become highly effective in suppressing prostaglandin E1 (50% inhibition)- and forskolin (70% inhibition)-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, which was assessed by measuring cyclic AMP accumulation in intact cells. Whereas the SH-SY5Y cells carry both mu and delta receptors in a ratio of mu/delta approximately equal to 5/1, the response is predominantly mediated by the mu receptor. Morphine acts as a strong agonist with an EC50 of 50 to 100 nM which falls into the therapeutic range expected for narcotic analgesic effects mediated by the mu receptor. Narcotic analgesic drugs with only partial agonism fail to evoke full response, which suggests that this cell model could provide a rapid screening assay for narcotic analgesic efficacy. Continued exposure of the cells to morphine resulted in partial tolerance within 12 hr with a 4-fold shift of morphine's EC50 to higher concentrations, whereas longer morphine exposure did not cause any further shift. Thus, the differentiated SH-SY5Y cells provide a suitable system for studying the molecular mechanisms of the narcotic analgesics.\r"

  ".W": "Catecholamine and indoleamine metabolism in nucleus tractus solitarius were studied during drug-induced hypertension and hypotension. Urethane-anesthetized normotensive male Sprague-Dawley rats implanted with a 250-mu carbon paste in vivo electrochemical electrode were infused with phenylephrine to raise blood pressure 50 mm Hg. Other animals were given nitroprusside to lower pressure 20 mm Hg. Phenylephrine-induced hypertension was associated with a 30% reduction in the electrochemical peak corresponding to norepinephrine. The electrochemical peak which was identified as 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was increased 25% with the onset of hypertension and remain elevated after the phenylephrine infusion was stopped. Nitroprusside-induced hypotension resulted in a 20% reduction in the norepinephrine peak during the infusion followed by an additional 10% reduction after the infusion. 5-HIAA concentration did not change during the hypotensive phase but showed a 40% increase after the nitroprusside was stopped as blood pressure rebounded to levels higher than the control period. Direct tissue assays of norepinephrine and 5-HIAA confirmed the electrochemical findings. These experiments were repeated in rats which had undergone sinoaortic denervation. The electrochemical changes in norepinephrine and 5-HIAA associated with hypertension and hypotension were attenuated in these animals indicating that the brain neurotransmitter changes were a consequence of baroreceptor input to the brain. We conclude that 5-HIAA in nucleus tractus solitarius appears to be a marker for elevated blood pressure, whereas norepinephrine falls with either an increase or a decrease in pressure.\r"

  ".U": "88199921\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of our study was to determine whether clonidine exerts its centrally mediated hypotensive action at three sites that influence arterial pressure located in the medulla, specifically associated with the intermediate area of the ventrolateral medulla. The \"intermediate area\" lies approximately 1.5 mm caudal to the border of the trapezoid body (caudal border) and 4 mm lateral to the midline. One of the sites that influence arterial pressure lies in the nucleus reticularis rostroventrolateralis. The second site lies in close proximity to the rostral part of the nucleus reticularis lateralis (rLRN) and also near the A1 area. The third site lies in the most rostral area and medial to the nucleus reticularis rostroventrolateralis, that is in the nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis. Unilateral microinjections of 0.22 and 0.43 nmol of clonidine into the rLRN produced dose-dependent decreases in arterial pressure. The 0.43 nmol dose of clonidine had no effect when unilaterally or bilaterally microinjected into either the nucleus reticularis rostroventrolateralis or into the nucleus paragigantocellularis lateralis. Microinjection of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan (16.6 nmol), unilaterally into rLRN had no effect per se, but prevented the hypotensive effect of a subsequent microinjection of clonidine. Similarly, bilateral microinjection of idazoxan into rLRN counteracted the hypotensive effect of i.v. administered clonidine. These data indicate that clonidine acts at alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the rLRN to produce hypotension.\r"

  ".U": "88199922\r", 
  ".W": "The authors have previously shown that the use-dependent action of lidocaine on the Vmax of canine Purkinje fibers and on intraventricular conduction in the in situ heart undergoes significant developmental changes. In this study, they use standard microelectrode techniques to test whether these age-related differences are due to the charged, more hydrophilic form or to the uncharged, more lipophilic form of a local anesthetic. QX-314, a permanently charged lidocaine derivative, depressed Vmax to a significantly greater extent in adult than in neonatal Purkinje fibers. This difference was due to its use-dependent blocking action and not to its tonic blocking action. The kinetic time constant (tau on) for the development of use dependence was shorter in adults (90 +/- 9 vs. 134 +/- 15 beats; P less than .05), whereas the time constant for recovery from use dependence (tau off) was shorter in neonates (53 +/- 4 vs. 106 +/- 10 sec; P less than .05). QX-314 (3 X 10(-5) M) shifted the curve of Vmax vs. activation voltage in a hyperpolarizing direction by 16.2 +/- 2.4 mV in adults and 5.1 +/- 1.1 mV in neonates (P less than .05). In contrast, the uncharged tertiary amine benzocaine (1 X 10(-5)-5 X 10(-4) M) showed no developmental differences in its effects on Vmax. Adult and neonatal fibers showed comparable tonic block and no use-dependent block. These results extend those of the authors' previous studies and suggest that developmental differences in the action of local anesthetics depend primarily on the use-dependent action of the charged molecular form.\r"

Acetylcholine (ACh) (1 microM) induced maximal relaxation of aortic ring segments with intact endothelium from both Wistar-Kyoto, normotensive rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at 5 to 6 weeks of age. At 15 to 18 weeks of age the relaxation response to ACh was reduced in rings from both SHR and WKY (to a greater extent in SHR) and was attenuated even more in the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rat. The contractile responses of aortic preparations to norepinephrine (NE) (0.1 microM) were similar between 5-6-week-old and 15-18-week-old WKY, but were increased in 15-18-week-old SHR compared to 5-6-week-old SHR. Endothelial cell removal increased contractile responses to NE to a greater extent in WKY than SHR but this did not affect that seen in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Methylene blue treatment increased contractions of aortic rings with intact endothelium from 15-18-week-old WKY and SHR to the level detected in rubbed arteries, but it did not affect the NE-induced constriction of intact aortic rings from DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Basal cyclic GMP concentrations in intact aortic rings were not different between SHR and WKY at 5 to 6 weeks of age. The basal aortic cyclic GMP was unchanged in WKY at 15 to 18 weeks of age, but decreased in SHR and in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats of the same age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All tissues were exposed to phenoxybenzamine to block tissue uptake of catecholamines and alpha adrenoceptors. The arterial and tracheal rings were contracted with 25 mM K+ in order to observe agonist-induced relaxation. Beta adrenergic agonist dose-response curves were obtained in all tissues in the presence and absence of the beta-2 selective antagonist, ICI 118,551. The orders of agonist potencies in the proximal and distal coronary arteries and the rabbit atria were the same: namely, isoproterenol (ISO) greater than norepinephrine (NE) much greater than procaterol. In contrast, that in the guinea pig trachea was procaterol greater than ISO greater than NE. Procaterol was a weak, partial agonist in the bovine coronary artery and rabbit atria and a potent, full agonist in the guinea pig trachea. The ICI 118,551 pA2 values in the proximal segment of the bovine coronary artery were the same against both NE and fenoterol, 7.38. In the distal segment, the values were 7.33 and 7.14, respectively.

  ".W": "The activities of 2-(alpha-naphthoyl)ethyltrimethylammonium (alpha-NETA) and its beta-isomer (beta-NETA) were studied at various sites of the cholinergic system using isolated enzyme and organ systems. They were selective inhibitors (I50: alpha-NETA, 9 microM; beta-NETA, 76 microM) of choline acetyltransferase (ChA). The inhibition of ChA by both alpha- and beta-NETA was noncompetitive with acetylcoenzyme A or choline as the variable substrate. In these experiments, the inhibitor and both substrates were added simultaneously to the reaction medium, and short reaction times of 10 min were used to determine initial linear velocities. Under these experimental conditions in the presence of substrates, the degree of inhibition of ChA by alpha-NETA was independent of enzyme concentration indicating the reversibility of the inhibition. If ChA was incubated with alpha-NETA for 10 min in the absence of substrates, the degree of inhibition was higher and was not reversible by dialysis of the inhibited ChA. These observations indicate that alpha-NETA is a pseudo-reversible or slowly reversible inhibitor. Neither alpha- nor beta-NETA exhibited significant effects at muscarinic receptors, ganglionic nicotinic receptors, skeletal muscular nicotinic receptors, cholinesterases or carnitine acetyltransferase at concentrations which inhibited ChA. At concentrations higher than their I50 values to inhibit ChA, both antagonized the effects of acetylcholine (ED50: alpha-NETA, 70-80 microM; beta-NETA, 100 microM), histamine and KCl-induced contractions in the guinea pig longitudinal ileal muscle. At high concentrations, alpha-NETA activated acetylcholinesterase (EC50, 360 microM) and inhibited cholinesterase (EC50, 1100 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rings were suspended in physiological salt solution for recording of isometric force. Cooling quiescent vessels resulted in an increase in force. This myogenic response was sensitive to depletion of either intra- or extracellular calcium, as well as treatment with the calcium antagonists verapamil and diltiazem. Cooling did not significantly alter contractile responses to norepinephrine in ear arteries under control conditions or under alpha-2 adrenergic blockade (rauwolscine). Cooling arteries under alpha-1 adrenergic blockade (prazosin) caused augmentations which were not significantly different in magnitude from the myogenic responses to cooling exhibited by the same rings when unstimulated. The alpha-1 adrenergic agonist phenylephrine caused concentration-dependent contractions which were not altered by cooling. The alpha-2 adrenergic agonist UK 14,304 evoked only weak contractions; cooling rings exposed to UK 14,304 caused further increases in tension but no more so than when quiescent. A similar pattern was seen to hold for contractions elicited by electrical stimulation. Thus, in the central ear artery of the rabbit cooling appears to have very little effect on adrenergically induced contractions but does cause the development of myogenic tone.\r"

In the eye, however, prior physiological studies have shown that these (+)-stereoisomers are unexpectedly potent in altering intraocular pressure, results which could be due to a difference in distribution and metabolism or to a difference in receptor interaction. The present experiments evaluated six stereoisomeric pairs of beta adrenergic antagonists for their ability to block rabbit ciliary process and cardiac beta adrenergic receptors activating adenylate cyclase, in vitro, under conditions in which the effects of drug metabolism, distribution and membrane lipid solubility were minimized. In the heart, all six pairs of antagonists demonstrated the expected increased potency of (-)-forms, with isomeric activity ratios of: 33 for metoprolol, 44 for timolol; 48 for bunitrolol; 76 for t-butyl-betaxolol; 100 for t-butyl-didesmethyl-ICI-118,551; and 530 for betaxolol. Under identical assay conditions in the ciliary process, (+)-enantiomers were much more potent relative to (-)-forms, with isomeric activity ratios of: 0.82 for timolol; 3.3 for bunitrolol; 7.4 for t-butyl-didesmethyl-ICI-118,551; 10 for metoprolol; 16 for t-butyl-betaxolol; and 190 for betaxolol. With the exception of metoprolol, all (+)-enantiomers demonstrated a substantially higher absolute affinity for ciliary process receptors (known to be almost exclusively of the beta-2 subtype) than for cardiac receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recent evidence suggests that delivery at an earlier gestational age using modern labor-induction techniques may prevent the increase in perinatal mortality and morbidity associated with prolonged pregnancy without increasing the incidence of prolonged labor and cesarean delivery.\r"

  ".W": "Postterm gestation infants represent about 10% of the newborn population and, as compared to term gestation infants, have an increased incidence of perinatal and neonatal problems. Most postterm infants are normal appearing, although changes in the skin and a loss of subcutaneous fat occur in some. A smaller number experience the onset of fetal wasting late in gestation and appear dysmature (postmature) at birth. The incidence of infants with dysmaturity increases as postterm gestation continues; however, the prevalence of dysmaturity is greater in term infants. The most significant neonatal problems in the postterm gestation infant are the result of fetal distress and perinatal asphyxia. Those infants affected most severely may have hypoxic encephalopathy, seizures and meconium aspiration syndrome. Other problems are birth trauma (due to the large size of some postterm infants) and polycythemia. Anencephaly is associated with postterm gestation. The later intellectual development of postterm gestation infants appears normal except for those with perinatal asphyxia or severe neonatal problems. The long-term somatic growth is normal, even in dysmature-appearing infants. Postterm infants are at increased risk for perinatal asphyxia; however, with careful obstetric management, most neonatal problems can be prevented.\r"

The existing information, spanning several decades, is confounded by several factors, such as different treatment eras, different population demographics, limited predictive value of testing preschool children, absence of term controls, retrospective nature of many surveys and unreliable criteria used to define prolonged pregnancy. At the University of Toronto a prospective, controlled study to determine the extent and frequency (if any) of developmental disturbances associated with prolonged pregnancy in both eutrophic and dysmature neonates is nearing completion. The results obtained could be important when one is faced with a decision on how to manage a postterm pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "From November 1984 to January 1986, 138 women were seen in our cervical clinic with atypical squamous cells in a referring cervical Papanicolaou smear. We obtained a second smear and performed a careful pelvic examination, microscopic examination of the vaginal secretions and endocervical culture for the gonococcus. The time interval between the smear showing atypical squamous cells and the one performed in our clinic ranged from 1 to 12 months. The Papanicolaou smear from 59 (50%) of the 117 women who had it repeated within four months returned abnormal as compared to 5 (24%) of the 21 repeated after four months (P = .04). Of 41 women with persistent atypical squamous cells, 10 (24%) had a clinically detectable vaginal infection, while only 3 (4%) of the 74 women with a normal repeat smear had an infection (P less than .01). These findings suggest an association between cervical cytology showing atypical squamous cells and vaginal infections. Nevertheless, this cytologic diagnosis should not be dismissed lightly since a high percentage of women with atypical squamous cells on cytology are found to have dysplasia on colposcopically directed biopsies. The most appropriate method of evaluating these patients has yet to be determined. If the clinician elects to follow these patients with serial Papanicolaou smears, the ideal interval between smears needs to be defined. Our data suggest that an interval of four to six months would be the most efficient.\r"

We developed a new and simple procedure for measuring blood on sanitary materials. The procedure is a modification of previous alkaline hematin methods but overcomes some of their major drawbacks. The method involves the separate extraction of blood using a detergent solution and color development of sample aliquots with sodium carbonate. The standard curves obtained for four products tested--regular maxi pads, thin maxi pads and two brands of tampons--were significantly linear over the range of 1-10 mL of blood. The extraction efficiency varied with the four products; tampons exhibited the highest extraction efficiency and thin maxi pads the lowest. Blood loss in normally menstruating women was estimated to be 41.8 +/- 3.9 mL, which correlates well with other estimates reported. Furthermore, the procedure can be used to measure both very low and very concentrated levels of blood on pads or tampons and thus can be used to assess both functional and dysfunctional uterine bleeding.\r"

The preoperative diagnosis was leiomyoma, and adenomyoma was not even considered; it was recognized during \"myomectomy\" in one case. Adenomyoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of a localized uterine tumor in an infertile woman. This preoperative recognition allows the gynecologist to discuss the lesion with the patient, pointing out that the operation may be technically difficult and may result in incomplete removal or hysterectomy and that excision of the tumor may not cure her infertility. It also prepares the gynecologist for the technical problems that may arise intraoperatively. Additional cases of adenomyoma in infertile women need to be reported on before light is shed on its causal relationship to infertility as well as on its diagnosis and management.\r"

Both intact SF, and cell depleted SF were tested for the effect on proteoglycan synthesis (35S-incorporation) compared to the patients' plasma or standard tissue culture medium. In addition, the effect on proteoglycan degradation was measured using 35S-prelabeled cartilage. Intact SF and cell depleted SF were found to suppress chondrocyte metabolism both in the RA and non-RA group. In the group with RA a strong correlation was found between the number of cells in SF and the degree of suppression. In the same group, intact SF caused a markedly higher suppression of chondrocyte biosynthesis than in the non-RA group (p less than 0.02). In general, the suppressive effect of SF appeared to be at least partially related to inflammatory activity (number of cells in SF) rather than a specific feature of RA. During the short term exposure, no measurable breakdown of matrix proteoglycan was found, both in complete SF and cell depleted SF. Mechanistic studies suggest that neither hydrogen peroxide generated by polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes nor variations in SF viscosity were responsible for the observed effects.\r"

Patients were classified into 3 types according to the extent of skin sclerosis within one year of presentation: Type 1 with sclerodactyly only; Type 2, skin stiffness proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints but sparing the trunk; and Type 3, diffuse skin stiffness including the trunk. Ten year survival was 71% in Type 1, 58% in Type 2 and 21% in Type 3. Quality of life was best in Type 1, intermediate in Type 2 and worst in Type 3. Nailfold capillary abnormalities did not discriminate between the types, but anticentromere antibody correlated strongly with Type 1. The simple subdivision of scleroderma based on the early extent of clinical skin involvement has been found to be useful in predicting longterm outcome in this highly variable disease.\r"

Levels of antibodies in the 2 groups were compared with antibody levels in 30 healthy adult controls, and in 20 children with nonrheumatic diseases. Antibodies to denatured and native collagen were increased in RA but not in JA. There was no apparent difference between the collagen antibody levels in any of the 3 subgroups of JA, pauciarticular, polyarticular or systemic onset disease. Antibodies to denatured collagen were not type specific, and reacted similarly with type I and type II collagens, but antibodies to native collagen were much more specific, and most reacted more strongly on type II collagen than on type I collagen. Our results, unlike those in previous reports, imply that antibodies to collagen are infrequent in JA and hence cannot be implicated in the pathogenesis of that disease, which is in contrast to adult onset RA.\r"

Additional analyses indicated that the residents rated as \"outstanding\" consistently performed better on the National Board of Medical Examiners' examinations than the residents rated as \"below average.\" However, other factors were not found to distinguish consistently among the residents when they were grouped into four categories on the basis of overall residency performance. These results support the consideration of academic variables in the residency selection process. However, their use as a single selection factor or as a method of screening out applicants from further consideration is, at best, justified only in the case of extremely high or low medical school achievement.\r"

After identifying four medical specialty services in a unit of a tertiary-care hospital where lengths of stay were excessive, even when the average severity of the discharged patients' illnesses in these services was considered, the authors developed two educational interventions to decrease lengths of stay. First, individual meetings were held with each of the attending physicians from three of the four specialty services, and the data on lengths of stay on that particular service were discussed. The fourth service was used as a control. Second, a continuing education meeting was held with attending physicians on all of the specialty services admitting patients to the unit. The data on lengths of stay for all services were discussed. The lengths of stay subsequently decreased significantly in the three targeted specialty services without any measurable change in the quality of care. This improved efficiency persisted for the 16 months after the intervention. Significant changes in length of stay were not observed in the control service or in any of the other specialty services in which the attending physicians experienced only the continuing education meeting.\r"

The results showed that the erotophobic students (those with negative feelings about sexuality) had significantly lower levels of sexual knowledge and were significantly less likely to participate in an elective human sexuality course than the erotophilic students (those with positive feelings about sexuality). Moreover, the erotophobic students who took part in the sexuality course benefited from it less than did the erotophilic students as measured by their willingness to treat patients with sexual concerns. Finally, although the students overall were relatively knowledgeable about sex and were relatively willing to treat patients with sexual concerns, troubling gaps in specific sexual knowledge and in willingness to treat patients with certain sexual concerns (such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome) were identified. Medical schools need to structure sex education in ways that take account of students' ambivalent feelings about sex and need to provide sex education that increases both sexual knowledge and willingness to treat patients with sexual concerns.\r"

It was anticipated by the organizers that after the conference the participants would be more cognizant of their influence as role models and would be motivated to become better role models and support good role-modeling. A synopsis of the conference indicates that the participants identified both the positive and negative impact of role-modeling and concluded that medical educational programs should use positive role-modeling as a teaching tool to instill within students the desire to gain new knowledge and to apply that knowledge as medical professionals.\r"

A modified version of a questionnaire produced and tested by the University of Minnesota and the widely used, standardized Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) were used to assess stress and psychological symptoms. There was a high correlation between high numbers of stressful events in the residents' and spouses' lives and high ratings of psychological symptoms. This finding was particularly true for the female residents. Overall, the residents' responses were near the mean for a nonpatient group used as a normative comparison on each of the nine subscales of the SCL-90 and on the overall mean for the entire scale. This finding indicated that the residents, although their lives were quite stressful, were handling the stress without major problems. The residents and their spouses also answered questions about 10 therapeutic interventions concerning stress and indicated which interventions they preferred.\r"

Unresolved issues from childhood sexual abuse may be a hidden factor underlying much substance abuse and if not treated may lead to rapid relapse.\r"

This paper presents a program of alcoholism identification and management training for family practice residents which has been developed to supplement an existing drug abuse treatment program. Residents spend four half-day sessions engaged in seminars, outpatient experiences, and inpatient rotations under the direction of a clinical psychologist specializing in substance abuse and under the direction of the medical staff of a voluntary hospital well-known as a center of alcoholism treatment. Training activities include participation in group therapy sessions with alcoholic patients, interviewing patients in the early stages of rehabilitation, participation in an adolescent alcoholism treatment program and attendance in seminars on the prevention, identification, and treatment of alcoholism. Residents' evaluations of the experience reveal overall satisfaction with the program and their roles in its conduct, but they indicate a need for more active roles in the hands-on management of emergency cases.\r"

A sample of 327 clients was contacted from the total number of 832 clients treated in the year 1985. These clients were selected in a random systematic fashion and were contacted by telephone using a structured interview. The treatment program employed five days of aversive counter-conditioning (faradic and \"quick Puff\") for various smoking behaviors. It also included an educational and counseling component during the initial counter-conditioning phase and a six week support phase with weekly support groups and one counter-conditioning reinforcement treatment in the second week. The clients were contacted a mean of 13.7 months after completion of treatment. The majority (55.7%) of the clients were male. Fifty-two percent of all clients achieved their goal of total abstinence from cigarettes since \"graduation\" from the program. The factor most predictive of success or failure was whether or not the client returned to a home containing a smoker. Of those returning to a nonsmoking home, 61.4% of the men and 60.2% of the women were successful. Of those who returned to a smoking household, 70.2% returned to smoking. This study demonstrates that the treatment process appears to be free of complications and is associated with successful outcomes in the majority of clients. Further improvement in outcome might result from simultaneous treatment of all household smokers.\r"

Both staff and patients noted significant barriers to methadone detoxification, estimating the likelihood of completing a successful taper at 10% and 14%, respectively. Patients reported psychological symptoms of withdrawal discomfort, but they emphasized physical problems of withdrawal much more than did staff. Both groups noted the need for counseling, role models of detoxified former addicts, and a wide array of available services.\r"

  ".W": "In many cases of urge incontinence the pathophysiology is unclear. Detrusor instability, detrusor hyperreflexia, urethral instability and poor sensory perception all have been suggested as requirements for urge incontinence. Sensory perception, as proposed recently, may be mediated by 2 bladder sensors. The first sensor, located at the trigone and posterior urethra, is sensitive to small changes in pressure and may function as an early warning system of bladder filling. In the diagnostic evaluation of urge incontinence 5 patients had a triad of absence of the first sensor, an intact second sensor, that is the urge to void when the bladder is stretched with fluid, and normal spontaneous detrusor contraction. Based upon these findings it is suggested that some instances of urge incontinence result when the early warning system fails and detrusor contraction occurs just shortly after the second sensor is stimulated. Detrusor instability was identified in 3 of the 5 patients with urge incontinence, and when present it was associated with urinary frequency. Thus, 2 forms of urge incontinence may be associated with loss of the first sensor: 1 with and the other without associated frequency, with the difference being the presence or absence of detrusor instability.\r"

The remaining 26 per cent of the cases were owing to idiopathic scrotal edema (8 per cent), epididymitis and orchitis (6 per cent each), and incarcerated hernia and acute hematocele (3 per cent each). The age distribution of these children was biphasic, with the highest frequency in newborns (with exclusively extravaginal torsion) and in boys 13 years old, whereas in boys with appendiceal torsion the single peak frequency was at age 10 years. While idiopathic scrotal edema occurred in children less than 7 years old and orchitis in patients more than 12 years old, epididymitis was observed in young boys and those of pubertal age.\r"

Quantitative morphometric analysis of nuclear shape has predicted the outcome of patients with prostatic carcinoma when evaluated by some but not all reported studies. Calculation of nuclear roundness factor by different investigators was complicated by equipment differences and lack of standardized methods for acquiring and reporting data. We have improved our system for nuclear contour digitization and determined its theoretical limitations by digitizing standardized objects. Measurement errors were independent of orientation or location of an object within a microscopic or digitizer tablet field, speed of digitization and introduction of a microscope extension tube and light emitting diode cursor. Perimeters and areas of circles and squares of actual or digitizer-projected diameter or sidelength greater than five mm. were measured with a reproducibility and accuracy of greater than or equal to 90%. When a microscopic circle of diameter similar to prostatic carcinoma nuclei was digitized at a magnification of 2580 X, perimeter and area measurements differed within or between observers by less than 5% and were more than 95% accurate. In order to calculate accurately and evaluate NRF for use in assessing the prognosis of patients with prostatic carcinoma investigators must precisely describe their digitization system, standardization method and observer reproducibility and accuracy when measuring circles that approximate the projected size of prostatic carcinoma nuclei.\r"

Systemic administration of either single or multiple doses of TNF into tumor bearing animals resulted in partial tumor regression and had a consistent but transient anti-tumor effect. Compared to control, untreated tumor bearing animals, TNF-treated tumor bearing mice had significantly smaller tumor volumes and slower tumor growth rates over the period of 12 days following TNF inoculation. No significant difference in tumor volumes and tumor growth rates between controls and TNF-inoculated mice was observed from day 12 to day 21 after TNF treatment. Assessment of TNF cytotoxicity against in vitro MBT-2 cell line using 3[H]-thymidine proliferation assay showed significant sensitivity of MBT-2 cells to treatment with TNF. A \"Variant\" MBT-2 cell line was derived by sequential culturing of the original MBT-2 cells in the presence of progressively higher concentrations of TNF in culture medium. Although the significant growth suppression on the MBT-2 tumor appears to be transient, further studies are warranted which may elucidate the immunologic and biologic behavior of TNF and this transplantable animal tumor.\r"

T1 and T2 relaxation times were measured with a Bruker PC Multispec at 20 MHz and 37C on the lyophilized sample and thereafter during gradual controlled rehydration. The prolongation of the relaxation times was found to be significantly different (p less than 0.001) for the SF and N groups, while it was similar for the SF and TSF groups. Water compartmentalization was then calculated according to the Fast Proton Infusion model. After the addition of similar amounts of water, significantly (p less than 0.01) different hydration fraction (HF) and fraction bound (FB) values were calculated for the N and SF groups, while similar values were obtained for the SF and TSF groups. The results reflect differences in the urinary contents and/or properties of N and SF groups. It seems that there are more hydrophilic compounds in the urine of N individuals than in that of SFs. It can be speculated that the urinary macromolecules of SFs differ from those of Ns in the amount of water binding sites and in the water multilayer thickness surrounding them. The present results point to possible pathogenic differences between SF and N individuals.\r"

  ".U": "88200460\r", 
  ".W": "The MAT-Lu subline of the Dunning R3327 system of rat prostatic adenocarcinomas universally metastasizes to the lungs of untreated recipient hosts. The MAT-Lu cancer was implanted into the hind leg of animals and the primary tumor was allowed to grow to various sizes before the tumor bearing leg was surgically removed. These studies demonstrated that there is a direct relationship between the size of the primary tumor at the time of surgical removal and the number of metastases already established in the lungs. Once the primary MAT-Lu reaches a size of greater than or equal to 0.5 cc, greater than or equal to 50% of all inoculated animals already have established lung metastases and are thus not cured by surgery alone. In an attempt to increase the cure rates, adjuvant chemotherapy (cytoxan given at a dose of 90 mg./kg. body weight) was used in combination with surgery. These studies demonstrated that if chemotherapy was given by itself to animals bearing macroscopically established (greater than or equal to 0.5 cc) MAT-Lu cancers, no animals could be cured. In direct contrast, by combining the same intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy with the removal of the primary MAT-Lu cancer, cures could be produced in high (greater than 90%) frequency, but only if this combinational approach was simultaneously initiated when the primary tumor was less than 2 cc in size. If the primary MAT-Lu cancer was allowed to grow to too large a size before surgery (greater than 2 cc) or if the chemotherapy was delayed following surgery (both processes allowing the metastatic tumor burden to increase before initiating adjuvant chemotherapy), the ability of the adjuvant chemotherapy to cure the host of its metastatic tumor burden is lost. These results demonstrate that the MAT-Lu rat prostatic cancer, like human prostatic cancer, is not effectively treated by chemotherapy alone or by adjuvant chemotherapy combined with surgery if the treatment is given too late in the course of the disease. These studies emphasize the critical requirement of combining surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy as early as possible in the treatment of metastatic prostatic cancer in order to minimize the total metastatic tumor burden and maximize the possibility of cure.\r"

Fine detail in-vitro radiographs of approximately equal sized calculi composed of COM, COD, struvite, brushite, uric acid and cystine showed structural differences which may account for differences in their fragility. The same six calculi were fragmented in vitro in the Dornier HM3 lithotriptor by 200 shocks at 18 KV and the percent weight of each calculus able to be filtered through a two mm. sieve was determined; COD and uric acid (100%); COM (64%); struvite (57%); brushite (47%); cystine (16%). The linear density of these calculi, measured by single photon emission absorbtiometry, correlated with radio-density, not fragility. Calculi of varying composition respond differently to shock wave fragmentation. The assessment of the capability of ESWL to fragment a stone will determine the size stone selected for treatment. Therefore, \"stone fragility\" is a new distinction which deserves to be included in the conversation about urinary calculi.\r"

  ".U": "88200465\r", 
  ".W": "Of 446 patients treated by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy 22 had small nonobstructive caliceal stones associated with lumbar or flank pain. Size (less than 1 cm.) and location of the stone did not explain the severity of the symptoms, nor would they have been an indication for open or percutaneous stone removal. Followup consisted of a sonogram and a film of the kidneys, ureters and bladder on postoperative day 1, a film of the kidneys, ureters and bladder 2 weeks after treatment, and a film of the kidneys, ureters and bladder and/or excretory urography after 3 months for patients with residual stone fragments. All patients were interviewed 3 to 15 months after treatment to ascertain the resolution or persistence of the symptoms. After extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, 3 of 22 patients had persistent stone fragments for more than 3 months: 2 reported no change and 1 had marked improvement of the symptoms. Of the remaining 19 patients 15 (79 per cent) had complete resolution of the pain and 4 (21 per cent) had significant symptomatic improvement. Thus, 20 of 22 patients (91 per cent) achieved complete or significant relief of pain. The only complication was a perirenal hematoma that resolved spontaneously. These results indicate that small, nonobstructive caliceal stones can be responsible for persistent, severe flank pain. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is an effective, noninvasive treatment for caliceal stones and it can be justified as therapeutic treatment when the correlation between a small caliceal stone and persistent flank pain is indeterminable.\r"

The stones were in the distal ureter over the sacroiliac joint in 10 patients, 8 of whom had undergone unsuccessful ureteroscopic manipulation. Two patients had horseshoe kidneys with stones that were too anterior to permit accurate targeting with the patient in the standard supine position. One patient had a solitary stone in a pelvic kidney and 1 had an obstructing ureteropelvic junction stone in a crossed ectopic kidney. The final patient had a reconstructed lower urinary tract with a stone at 1 of the ureterointestinal anastomoses. Excellent pulverization was achieved in all patients after only 1 prone ESWL treatment. One patient required temporary percutaneous nephrostomy after ESWL and 1 may require retrograde manipulation of fragments at the ureterovesical junction. No patient had melena, and other than temporary ileus in 1 patient who had concurrent supine ESWL of renal calculi, no gastrointestinal complications were seen. All but 1 patient were free of stones 1 month after prone ESWL. Prone ESWL prevents blockage of shock wave energy by the bony pelvis, because the shock waves enter anteriorly and exit posteriorly. ESWL with the patient in the prone position is a safe and effective treatment of calculi in the distal ureter or anomalous kidney.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the ability of low doses of botulinum A toxin, an inhibitor of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, to denervate and relax the spastic rhabdosphincter in 11 men with spinal cord injury and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. Toxin concentration, injection volume, percutaneous versus cystoscopic injection of the sphincter and number of injections were evaluated in 3 treatment protocols. All 10 patients evaluated by electromyography after injection showed signs of sphincter denervation. Bulbosphincteric reflexes in the 10 patients evaluated after injection were more difficult to obtain, and they showed a decreased amplitude and normal latency. The urethral pressure profile in the 7 patients in whom it was measured before and after treatment decreased an average of 27 cm. water after toxin injections. Post-void residual urine volume decreased by an average of 146 cc after the toxin injections in 8 patients. In the 8 patients for whom it could be determined toxin effects lasted an average of 50 days. The toxin also decreased autonomic dysreflexia in 5 patients.\r"

However, for this procedure to gain maximal acceptance, it should be possible to use voided urine specimens instead of bladder washings. To evaluate this possibility we compared histogram findings for 114 bladder washings and 122 concomitantly obtained urine samples (voided and catheterized) from 89 consecutive patients who had active or a history of transitional cell carcinoma. Unsatisfactory histograms were obtained in 4 per cent of the urine samples and in 2.6 per cent of the bladder washing samples. The satisfactory rate for voided or catheterized urine samples was the same. We conclude that in this patient population satisfactory deoxyribonucleic acid histograms can be obtained from samples of voided urine.\r"

Patients received 6 weekly intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations and they were followed for response every 3 months with urinary cytology, cystoscopy and bladder biopsy. Patients were considered treatment failures if either the cytology studies or biopsies were positive for tumor. Of 65 patients who failed the initial treatment course 57 were given an additional 6-week course of therapy. One 6-week course of bacillus Calmette-Guerin was successful in 20 of 55 patients (36 per cent) treated for prophylaxis, 12 of 32 (37 per cent) treated for carcinoma in situ and 7 of 17 (41 per cent) treated for residual tumor. The response rate for the total patient population treated with 1, 6-week course was 37.5 per cent (39 of 104). A second 6-week course was successful in 19 of 29 patients (65 per cent) treated for prophylaxis, 11 of 18 (71 per cent) treated for carcinoma in situ and 4 of 10 (40 per cent) treated for residual tumor. The response rate for all patients receiving a second course of bacillus Calmette-Guerin was 59.6 per cent (34 of 57). Of 6 patients who refused another 6-week course of bacillus Calmette-Guerin 4 had additional recurrences and 3 of these 4 suffered invasive disease. The over-all therapeutic response rate for patients treated with either 6 or 12 weeks of therapy was 70 per cent. These results suggest that 6 weeks of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin do not provide optimal therapy for superficial bladder tumors. The data further suggest that more intensive regimens may increase therapeutic efficacy.\r"

Purified protein derivative skin test reactivity, tumor stage, tumor grade and number of previous tumor recurrences were evaluated in all patients. In addition, the prognostic value of a granulomatous response in the bladder was evaluated in 62 of the 104 patients. A significant correlation was reconfirmed between purified protein derivative reactivity and status free of tumor (p equals 0.041) after additional followup on 62 patients from a previous report. A significant correlation also was observed in the total patient population (p equals 0.054). Over-all, 60 per cent of the 62 patients and 52 per cent of the 104 patients whose purified protein derivative test converted from negative to positive remained free of tumor, compared to only 28 per cent of the 62 patients and 28 per cent of the 104 whose test failed to convert to positive. Mean followup was 29.3 +/- 5.7 months in the 62 patient subgroup and 23.5 +/- 5.8 months in the total 104 patients. Bladder granuloma data were available only for the 62 patient subgroup in the previous report. With extended followup, the significant correlation previously reported between status free of tumor and granulomatous response on bladder biopsy was lost. Over-all, 29 of 37 patients (51 per cent) with granulomas compared to 8 of 25 (32 per cent) without granulomas remained free of tumor (p equals 0.132). Tumor stage and grade, and number of previous tumor recurrences failed to show a significant correlation to status free of tumor. These results show that with extended followup, granulomatous response in the bladder lost its statistical correlation with status free of tumor, while a significant correlation was maintained for purified protein derivative responsiveness. This level of statistical significance was borderline and the purified protein derivative skin test response should not be considered useful as a prognostic indicator in individual patients.\r"

Controlled expansion cylinders were used for revision after cylinder leaks and for penile straightening procedures as well as in the primary treatment of impotence. During our 3-year followup of these patients there have been no recurrences of the primary problem that necessitated the revision.\r"

A strict, broad-spectrum antibiotic schedule was adhered to rigidly by all patients, beginning preoperatively and continuing for a total of 10 days of perioperative coverage. Staphylococcus species were cultured in 56 per cent of the infected patients and in 100 per cent of the patients with positive cultures. Spinal cord injury patients showed a particular predisposition to prosthetic infection, with a 15 per cent incidence of infectious complications. Two other patients became infected after dental procedures and the need for routine antibiotic prophylaxis in the penile prosthesis patient is emphasized. Urinary tract instrumentation at the time of prosthetic implantation, whether planned or incidental, also appears to add a potentially avoidable risk for subsequent infection.\r"

It is suggested that differences between prosthesis models are more a result of psychological, relationship and health factors than mechanical factors. Of the patients 79 per cent would undergo the operation again but only 59 per cent of the partners had no hesitations. The longer the postoperative period the more hesitations.

Of the prostates 18 (86 per cent) contained residual tumor: 13 (62 per cent) had minimal residual tumor and 5 (24 per cent) had substantial tumor. The residual carcinoma in the prostates with minimal tumor was predominantly in the apex of the gland or peripherally adjacent to the capsule such that complete removal by repeat transurethral resection would have been unlikely. Of the 5 specimens with substantial tumor, although some would have been upstaged by repeat transurethral resection, others would have remained stage A1 because of the peripheral location of the residual tumor. Within the definition of stage A1, using either the percentage of tumor involvement, weight of tumor or number of tumor foci in the transurethral resection specimen, one could not predict whether the prostatectomy specimen would have no, minimal or substantial residual tumor. Postoperatively, all patients are continent and 93 per cent are potent. Because some men with stage A1 carcinoma of the prostate will have substantial residual tumor not necessarily detected by repeat transurethral resection and the majority will have minimal residual tumor, which also appears to have an increased long-term risk of progression, radical prostatectomy should remain an option in the management of relatively young men with stage A1 disease.\r"

More recently, we have shown that 16 per cent of the men with stage A1 disease who remained at risk for 8 years or longer after diagnosis had progression of disease despite a small percentage of the specimen involved by tumor. To address whether the actual volume of tumor resected may be a better predictor of progression than the percentage of the specimen involved by tumor the data from these studies were re-evaluated. We demonstrated that at 4 and 8 years of followup the percentage of the specimen and resected tumor volume were strongly associated with tumor progression, with the percentage of the specimen showing a stronger association especially at 4 years. Our study reaffirms the use of the percentage of resected tissue involved by tumor as a means to distinguish between stages A1 and A2 prostate cancer. Although at 8 years the distinction between stages A1 and A2 disease is blurred, this staging classification still is useful to identify those tumors with a relatively indolent course and a minimal short-term risk of progression from those that are more aggressive.\r"

In normal subjects total urinary volume was r equals 0.716, p less than 0.001 and urinary sulfate was r equals 0.813, p less than 0.001, while in patients with stones these values were r equals 0.338, p less than 0.001 and r equals 0.326, p less than 0.001, respectively. The only significant difference in excretion of urinary glycosaminoglycans between the groups was found in the subgroup of patients with type I absorptive hypercalciuria. The type I absorptive hypercalciuria value of 33.4 +/- 14.9 mg. per day in patients with stones was significantly higher than the 25.8 +/- 8.3 mg. per day detected in normal subjects (p less than 0.05). Urinary glycosaminoglycan excretion in all other subgroups of nephrolithiasis as well as in a combined group of all patients with stones showed no significant difference when compared to that of normal subjects. Thus, no major quantitative relationship could be demonstrated between urinary glycosaminoglycan excretion and calcium stone formation in this study.\r"

However, data on the elimination rate of MCT-containing emulsions during an intravenous fat-tolerance test (IVFTT) are scarce. We performed this test (0.1 g lipid/kg body weight) in 18 young healthy volunteers (nine females and nine males) using Lipofundin MCT 10% (50% MCT; egg phospholipids as emulsifier). Our results indicate that both elimination and metabolization of the emulsion are fast: a prompt decrease of light-scattering index and of triglyceride concentrations in serum, an immediate appearance of post-load fatty acids and of beta-hydroxybutyrate were observed. This was in good agreement with the findings obtained during 6-hr infusions in the same probands. Fractional elimination rates k2 obtained from light-scattering indices are 7.29 +/- 2.73%/min in males and 11.59 +/- 3.38%/min in females, indicating a higher removal capacity in women. In the same subjects, the corresponding k2 values for Lipofundin S 10% (containing only long chain triglycerides) were higher, reflecting an elimination rate that is faster due to the use of soya bean phospholipids as emulsifier. In comparison, k2 values based on the course of the triglyceride concentrations are generally lower.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of intercorrelation among dietitian, physician, and team nutrition support functions. Eight hundred and eighty dietitians and physicians were asked to respond to a questionnaire describing nutrition support functions as reported in the literature and validated by a panel of nutrition support physicians and dietitians. Two hundred and fifty-four completed questionnaires were included in the study, 84 from physicians and 170 from dietitians. Intercorrelations among function statements were subjected to factor analysis. The magnitude and consistency of factor loadings suggest that nutrition support is not perceived as independent components, but as a comprehensive pattern or structure. However, there was one important difference in perception. The sample tended to have an \"enteral\" orientation to the dietitian role and a \"parenteral\" orientation to the physician and team roles. The data support the contention that all members of nutrition support teams need a common core of knowledge and a set of highly developed process skills which can best be attained through an integrated, rather than segmented, approach to team training.\r"

Dietary carotenoids consist of individual retinoids--pro-vitamin A precursors and non-pro-vitamin A precursors-displaying different biological activity. Although epidemiological data suggest that low serum vitamin A levels were associated with an increased risk of cancer, it is not known whether one specific or all vitamin A carotenoids are involved. To assess whether the plasma carotenoids are related to the nutritional or cancer-bearing state, a study was conducted to measure total and individual carotenoids in four groups: cancer-bearing, malnourished; cancer-bearing, well-nourished; non-cancer, malnourished; and well-nourished volunteers of comparable age and sex. There was no difference in total carotenoids and pro-vitamin A precursors between the well-nourished--both normal volunteers and cancer patients. Malnourished cancer and non-cancer patients had significantly (p less than 0.05) lower value of both. Most of the circulating carotenoids in all groups were the non-pro-vitamin A precursors. Both malnourished cancer and non-cancer patients had lower values than well-nourished (p less than 0.05). Differences were related to nutritional state, rather than presence of cancer.\r"

Similar products from different manufacturers and different lots were measured for Al using electrothermal atomic absorption technique. Aluminum measurements were made directly from the samples or after reconstitution or dilution with Al-free water. Aluminum content was lowest (less than 50 micrograms/liter) in human milk, whole cow milk, and products that appear to require minimal manufacture processing and have few additives such as skim milk, cow milk with 2% fat, bottled glucose water, and sterile water. Highest Al levels (up to 2346 micrograms/liter) were found in highly processed and modified formulas including soy formula, preterm infant formula, and formulas for specific metabolic disorders. Aluminum content of humanized cow milk formula and bottled glucose-electrolyte solution were between the two ranges and usually less than 400 micrograms/liter. There were no significant differences in Al content of similar products from different manufacturers. Liquid formula stored in glass bottles has highest Al content compared to that stored in steel cans or powder preparation of the same product (p less than 0.05). Thus there are marked differences in Al loading depending on the type of formula, whether it is a powder or liquid preparation and the type of storage container. We speculate that raw materials such as soybean, additives such as calcium and phosphorus, manufacturing processes and storage containers are potential sources of contamination of infant formulas.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests a role for lipid deposition in the pathogenesis of some forms of glomerular disease. To gain further insight into this phenomenon guinea pigs (GP) were fed a 2% cholesterol (HC) diet and compared to GP on a normal diet (C). Serial observations were made 5, 10, 30 and 70 days after the initiation of the experiment. HC gained less weight than C (P less than 0.001) and developed hemolytic anemia after 30 days. At all time periods serum total cholesterol (TC) was significantly elevated in HC (P less than 0.001). High density lipoprotein-cholesterol and total phospholipids (PL) were significantly higher in HC at days 30 and 70. Lipoprotein-X was detected in HC serum. The relative proportion (%) of cholesteryl ester (CE) at day 70 was significantly higher in HC than in C when renal cortical lipids were analyzed (P less than 0.017). Renal function was normal in both groups throughout the 70 days. The HC group developed proteinuria and hematuria (proteinuria, HC = 22.1 +/- 7.2 mg/24 hr; C, 6.4 +/- 2.3 mg/24 hr), which was detected at day 70 but not at day 30. HC developed significant progressive mesangial expansion which was first evident at day 30. In HC only oil red 0 material was first detected in glomeruli at day 5 and was very conspicuous at day 70. Increased intraglomerular monocyte numbers were detected at day 70 (P less than 0.017) but not at day 30 in HC. No glomerulosclerosis was observed in GP's with drug-induced hemolysis on a normal diet. To see the effect of high protein intake on HC GP's, a group of GP's was put on a HC diet for 30 days followed by a 2% cholesterol-high protein (HCHP) diet for 40 days. Compared to HC GP's, the HCHP group showed significantly higher serum TC and PL (P less than 0.017), mesangial expansion (P less than 0.01) and proteinuria (P less than 0.01). The results indicate that hypercholesterolemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis in this model and that the process appears to be mediated, at least in part in the later stages, by monocytes. The addition of protein to the HC diet augments these effects.\r"

Ussing chamber studies demonstrated that these cultured cells generated transepithelial potential differences of approximately -2.0 mV and resistances of 0.310 K omega.cm2, supporting the concept that the proximal tubule is a \"leaky\" epithelium. The electrical properties did not change when the cells were exposed to amiloride (10(-4) M), but did respond to acetazolamide (10(-4) M), consistent with responses known to occur in proximal tubules. Ultrastructural analysis of these cells demonstrated features indicative of proximal tubule cells. When grown on permeable supports, where apical and basolateral growth medium compartments were maintained separate from each other, the cells were noted to undergo increased differentiation with morphological evidence of cell polarity. Freeze fracture analysis demonstrated well-formed tight junction strands and segregation of unique numbers of intramembranous particles in apical, lateral, and basal membranes. The replicas also demonstrated the presence of aggregates though to represent gap junctions, structures which occur exclusively in the proximal segment of the human nephron. These observations provide evidence that this human cell culture model originates from the human proximal tubule and retains, in culture, many of the properties associated with proximal tubule cell function and structure in vivo.\r"

Heparan sulfate is known to be an important component of the charge-selective barrier to filtration of polyanions. We studied the alterations in both the charge and size selectivity barriers in a model of experimental membranous nephropathy in the rabbit. The fractional clearance of both charged and uncharged dextrans compared to inulin was measured. Sulfate incorporation into glycosaminoglycans was measured and the glomerular heparan sulfate was isolated and biochemically characterized. Membranous nephropathy in the rabbit was induced with daily injections of cationic bovine serum albumin. After three weeks of injection animals had 735 +/- 196 mg/24 hours of protein excretion. There was no change in [35S] incorporation in 24 hours by experimental animals, 440 +/- 91 DPM/mg dry weight of glomeruli, N = 9 versus 410 +/- 98, N = 11 in controls. The percentage of [35S] incorporated into heparan sulfate versus chondroitin sulfate was decreased, 60% +/- 3 versus 79% +/- 2, P less than 0.001. Heparan sulfate from membranous nephropathy eluted from ion exchange chromatography in a lower molarity salt, indicating a lower effective charge. Fractional clearance of neutral dextrans was significantly increased in membranous nephropathy for dextrans greater than 48 A, while fractional clearance of dextran sulfates was significantly increased compared to controls for dextrans greater than 32 A. Thus, in membranous nephropathy there is loss of both charge selectivity and size selectivity. The loss of charge selectivity correlated with a change in the structure of the glomerular heparan sulfate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After proteinuria of longer duration focal and segmental glomerular hyalinosis and sclerosis (FSGHS) develops. The present report analyzes these aspects of PAN nephrosis in PVG/c rats, a strain previously shown to be remarkably resistant to proteinuria and FSGHS with aging or after uninephrectomy. In Wistar rats multiple injections of PAN during five months resulted in sustained severe proteinuria and FSGHS lesions in 8.1 +/- 1.0% (mean +/- 1 SEM) of their glomeruli (N = 6). In PVG/c rats a 1.3-fold higher dose of PAN was needed to induce chronic proteinuria similar to the Wistar rats. After five months 3.3 +/- 0.9% of their glomeruli showed FSGHS (N = 6, P less than 0.01) and the glomerular lesions were considerably less advanced. In acute PAN nephrosis induced by a single intravenous injection of PAN the mesangium of Wistar rats contained large amounts of lipid in contrast to a few small mesangial lipid droplets in nephrotic PVG/c rats. After injection of colloidal carbon in nephrotic PVG/c rats no enhanced carbon accumulation was found in the mesangium when compared to nonproteinuric controls. This result clearly differs from the increased mesangial sequestration of circulating material in nephrotic Wistar, and most other rat strains. The unchanged mesangial traficking of macromolecules in nephrotic PVG/c rats and the low incidence of FSGHS lesions in the presence of sustained glomerular proteinuria may reflect a relative resistance to PAN-induced glomerular damage in this particular rat strain.\r"

Creatinine clearance was decreased three days after clamping the renal arteries (0.42 +/- 0.03 ml/min/100 g, N = 6 in ATN vs. 0.68 +/- 0.09, N = 7 in sham controls; P less than 0.001). Plasma concentrations (24.1 +/- 1.9 pg/ml) and PR of calcitriol (9.8 +/- 0.91 ng/kg/day) were significantly lower in ATN rats three days after ischemic insult when compared to sham control rats, respectively (76.6 +/- 7.3 pg/ml, and 29.6 +/- 3.3 ng/kg/day; both P less than 0.01). The MCRs of calcitriol were not different between ATN (0.28 +/- 0.02 ml/min/kg) and sham control rats (0.27 +/- 0.01). By the seventh day after ischemic injury, when creatinine clearance of ATN rats returned to normal, both the PR and plasma concentrations of calcitriol also returned to normal values in these animals. In order to assess the effect of uremia on calcitriol metabolism, MCR and PR of calcitriol were measured in rats with reinfusion of their urines for 24 hours. The PR of calcitriol was significantly decreased (9.42 +/- 1.21; vs. controls, 20.5 +/- 2.9 ng/kg/day, P less than 0.001) in uremic animals. Since decreased PR of calcitriol was also accompanied by decreased MCR of calcitriol, plasma concentrations of calcitriol of the uremic rats with intact kidneys remained within normal values. We conclude that the PR of calcitriol is decreased early in ATN rats. Although the MCR was not decreased in mild ATN rats, it may decrease in severe acute renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "Fatty acids are an important source of skeletal muscle energy, and certain data suggest oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) may be impaired in uremia. This abnormality may in part be responsible for uremic myopathy. Uremia is associated with hyperparathyroidism and PTH affects muscle metabolism; PTH enhances muscle proteolysis and impairs muscle bioenergetics, and it is possible that PTH also affects fatty acids oxidation. The present study examined in rats the effects of 4 days administration PTH and of 21 days of chronic renal failure (CRF) with and without excess PTH on oxidation of LCFA and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Both 1-84 and 1-34 PTH impaired oxidation of LCFA but not of a SCFA (beta-hydroxybutyric acid) and reduced the activity of carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT). Inactivation of the PTH abolished its effects. CRF rats with intact parathyroid glands had also impaired oxidation of LCFA and of CPT activity. Parathyroidectomy in CRF rats normalized these abnormalities. Carnitine contents of muscle were not altered. The data show that PTH excess in normal or in CRF rats is associated with impaired oxidation of LCFA and this effect is due to reduction in the activity of CPT, a key enzyme for the transport of LCFA to mitochondrial matrix for beta-oxidation. The data demonstrate another toxic effect of PTH on muscle in CRF and provide an additional pathogenic mechanism for uremic myopathy.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of three factors, namely dietary protein intake, age and sex, on the susceptibility of the renal glomerulus to the binding of antiglomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM) in the early (heterologous) phase of anti-GBM nephritis, and the consequent reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as measured by inulin clearance (CIn). The effect of diet was examined in approximately equal to 8 week-old female Munich-Wistar rats fed a 40% high (HP) or a 6% low (LP) protein diet, and that of sex and age in male and female rats, 6 week or 10 month old. Following an intravenous dose (3 to 20 micrograms/g body wt) of radiolabeled nephritogenic anti-GBM, assessment of glomerular function was followed by quantitation of anti-GBM binding (values corrected for GBM surface area) in isolated glomeruli. At a given plasma level of antibody, the degree of binding of anti-GBM was slightly but significantly higher in HP than LP-fed rats; the decrease in GFR was significantly more pronounced in HP than LP-fed animals. The amount of anti-GBM binding was significantly greater in adult than young animals; however, the consequent decrease in GFR was more pronounced in the young than adult animals. Sex dependency was not discernible in anti-GBM binding or reduction in GFR. In all of the above experimental groups, the degree of anti-GBM binding was closely correlated with the plasma level of anti-GBM, but not with effective renal plasma flow rate, measured by PAH clearance. Separate groups of rats were subjected to experimental manipulation of single nephron GFR, glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure and glomerular plasma flow rate, by partial aortic constriction and saralasin administration. This set of experiments, using a tracer amount of non-nephritogenic anti-GBM, revealed that glomerular anti-GBM binding is independent of any of the above parameters. The studies indicate that dietary protein intake and age, but not sex, are among the factors determining the susceptibility of the glomerulus to acute immune injury. Since the binding of anti-GBM is determined by the affinity property of the glomerulus per se, and not by the prevailing hemodynamic pattern, the observed dependence of susceptibility to functional impairment on age and protein intake appears to also reflect a property of the glomerulus, which is influenced by age and the degree of dietary protein intake.\r"

Public self-consciousness proved to mediate the behavioral expression of conventional expectancies concerning drunken comportment.
