Intestinal parasitism with one or multiple organisms was the cause of eosinophilia in all but six of these patients. Hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis were among the potentially pathogenic organisms most frequently implicated (55% and 38%, respectively). There was no correlation between the age or sex of the patients and the type of infecting organism. We also confirmed the usefulness of a previously described serological test for diagnosing infection with Strongyloides stercoralis and examined the test's ability to distinguish between infected and noninfected individuals and to determine parasitological cure.\r"

Five patients with systemic CSD had either neuroretinitis, pleurisy, arthralgia or arthritis, splenic abscesses, and mediastinal masses or enlarged nodes of the head of the pancreas. Recurrent CSD in two of three adults was confirmed by finding typical CSD bacilli in lymph nodes removed during separate episodes. The majority of patients were adult males, and all patients recovered completely without sequelae. Histopathologic studies of five skin and 18 lymph node biopsy specimens were diagnostic. CSD bacilli were detected in lymph nodes from 15 patients and in the primary skin lesions of four patients. CSD bacilli were found in both skin and lymph nodes of three patients.\r"

  ".W": "The composition of the monomeric unit of staphylococcal peptidoglycan has been known since the late 1960s. However, the three-dimensional structure of this macromolecule has been unclear. Staphylococci divide with expansion of a central cross wall into a peripheral hemisphere under conditions that suggest that additional monomers are not introduced, but rather that the shape of existing monomers is changed. The monomeric unit can be divided into a glycan chain piece, a connecting peptide, and a peptide chain piece, which define a solid parallelogram. In the proposed model, appropriate change in the angle of the glycan chain with respect to the peptide chain doubles the surface, as required to deform cross wall into peripheral wall. Furthermore, cross wall peptidoglycan is synthesized in a spiral, which becomes deformed into a spiral to form peripheral wall, and the glycan chain is twisted with two disaccharide units per turn. Insights from the model can be applied to other peptidoglycans and can help explain the mechanism for start of cell division, the functions of various penicillin-binding proteins, the method of resistance to methicillin, and the occurrence of osmotically growth-dependent bacteria.\r"

Viral infection of Mastomys from houses ranged from 0% to 80%. The incidence of seroconversions in susceptible persons ranged from 5% to 22% per year; the ratio of illness to infection ranged from 9% to 26%, and the proportion of febrile illness associated with seroconversion was 5%-14%. Eightfold rises in titer of antibody occurred in 1%-18% of the antibody-positive population, a result suggesting reinfection. We estimate the ratio of fatalities to infection to be 1%-2%, a rate lower than estimates based on hospitalized cases. The high incidence of Lassa fever makes it a major problem in West Africa.\r"

Lassa fever was responsible for 10%-16% of all adult medical admissions and for approximately 30% of adult deaths in the two hospitals studied. The case-fatality ratio for 441 hospitalized patients was 16.5%. We found the best predictor of Lassa fever to be the combination of fever, pharyngitis, retrosternal pain, and proteinuria (predictive value together, .81); of outcome, the best predictor was the combination of fever, sore throat, and vomiting (relative risk of death, 5.5). Complications included mucosal bleeding (17%), bilateral or unilateral eighth-nerve deafness (4%), and pleural (3%) or pericardial (2%) effusion. Lassa fever is endemic in this area and is a more-common cause of hospital admission and death than has previously been described; this disease must be considered when diagnosing febrile illness in West Africa.\r"

Virus was found in throat cultures from 39% of viremic patients, compared with 14% of nonviremic patients (P less than .002); however, the level of virus was usually less than or equal to TCID50/ml. Fewer than 3% of patients were viruric during acute illness, and virus was isolated from three of three samples of cerebrospinal fluid. On admission, 53% of patients had IgG antibodies, and 67% had IgM antibodies. Recovery was not associated with the presence of either IgG or IgM. Virus was isolated from greater than 100 serum specimens that also contained high titers of IgG. Clinical Lassa fever was shown to be a disseminated systemic, primary viral infection, with an outcome highly associated with viremia but not with development of antibody.\r"

The antigen was an acid-glycine extract of C. pyloridis, and titers ranged from 80 to 22,000 ELISA units (EU). Of 117 patients in whom C. pyloridis was detected microbiologically or histologically, 87 (74%) had a titer greater than or equal to 300 EU, and only one had a titer less than 150 EU. Of 43 patients in whom C. pyloridis was not detected, only two (5%) had a titer greater than 300 EU. Thus, for a titer of 300 EU the ELISA test had a specificity of 97% and a sensitivity of 81%. At 150 EU the specificity was 78%, and the sensitivity was 99%. Histological diagnosis of active chronic gastritis was associated with a high median ELISA titer (485 E), chronic gastritis with a much lower titer (150 EU), and normal histology with a titer of 110 EU. Discriminating use of this serological test could be of assistance to detect C. pyloridis in the gastric mucosa.\r"

Liposome-encapsulated MTP-PE (L-MTP-PE) was superior to free MTP-PE in activating alveolar macrophages and in protecting mice against intranasal challenge with 10 LD50 (50% lethal dose) of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Mice treated with liposome-encapsulated or free MTP-PE had no detectable viremia and had lower pulmonary titers of virus than controls. Liposome-encapsulated RIB (L-RIB; 3 mg per mouse), administered several hours after infection, was more effective than was free RIB (10 mg per mouse) in protecting mice against intranasal challenge with 10 LD50 of influenza virus, but neither L-RIB nor free RIB protected mice against HSV-1 infection. In contrast, combination therapy with both L-RIB and L-MTP-PE was more effective than either agent used alone.\r"

Exopolymer-free bacteria were prepared and inoculated into subcutaneously implanted tissue cages. After three hours, the bacteria showed abundant capsular and intercellular exopolymers, which were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Exopolymers were also produced by S. aureus exposed in electron microscopy. Exopolymers were also produced by S. aureus exposed in vitro to fluid from the tissue cage. In contrast, human serum albumin prevented exopolymer production by S. aureus. The influence of exopolymers on the susceptibility of S. aureus to ingestion and phagocytic killing by neutrophils was tested in vitro and found to be negligible. Furthermore, adherence of S. aureus to fibronectin-coated surfaces was unaffected by the presence or absence of exopolymers. Thus, in our experimental model, exopolymers are produced early during the onset of infection, but they have little impact on adherence and phagocytosis.\r"

In normal mice, necrosis developed at the site of inoculation, surrounded by areas with intense mononuclear inflammation and cyst formation; tachyzoites were not detectable after two weeks. Immunosuppressed mice had even-larger areas of tissue destruction, and tachyzoites were always detectable. Brains from cortisone-treated mice had numerous tachyzoites, but scant inflammation. Brains from cyclophosphamide-treated mice revealed cysts and a variable degree of inflammation. Compared with brains from controls, brains from cyclosporine-treated mice revealed attenuated inflammation; however, there were fewer tachyzoites and less tissue destruction than in the brains from cortisone-treated mice. The spectrum of histological findings observed in the model is similar to that observed in brains from humans with toxoplasmic encephalitis.\r"

The study reveals that fertilization is significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) only if both IgA and IgG antibodies are present in semen but there is no reduction if either class is present alone. The fertilization rate of oocytes is significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) by sperm from oligospermic samples, and there is a further reduction in those cases with combined IgA/IgG antispermatozoal antibodies.\r"

A positive correlation was observed between the follicular estradiol (E2) peak and the progesterone (P) level on day 3 of the luteal phase, but no correlation was found between the E2-peak value and the luteal-phase duration or midluteal P concentration. When the trials were classified in relation to their outcome (i.e., clinical pregnancies, chemical pregnancies, or failures), the mean P level on day 3 of the luteal phase was significantly higher in clinical pregnancies than in chemical pregnancies and in failures. Mean E2 levels on day 3 were not significantly different among the three groups. Values of the E2/P ratio were significantly higher in chemical pregnancies than in the other groups. No significant differences were observed among the three groups on day 8. When comparing trials ending in failure to those leading to clinical pregnancy for the same patients, pregnancies were obtained in cycles in which early luteal P was higher and the early luteal E2/P ratio was lower than in failures cycles. These data suggest that high P levels and a low E2/P ratio in the early luteal phase might have a favorable influence on the implantation process in human IVF.\r"

Oocyte recovery was ultrasonically guided, the bladder filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and a cannula with trocar used for single percutaneous puncture. The aspiration needle was of 1.6 mm in internal diameter. When compared to published data using smaller-bore needles, it seems that this improved needle increased the number of oocytes recovered to a mean of 6.5 and the number of embryos replaced to a mean of 3.9 per patient, with a pregnancy rate of 20% per transfer.\r"

Because neutrophil activation, either alone or in concert with other blood cells, can induce vaso-occlusion by aggregation, leukoembolization, and inflammatory damage to vascular endothelium, we studied the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on neutrophil activation in vitro and on microvascular integrity in vivo. beta-Adrenergic antagonists, propranolol and alprenolol, could induce dose-related and stereospecific activation of human neutrophils resulting in granulocyte aggregation and migration. Propranolol produced de novo aggregation and also enhanced responses to chemotaxins, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and C5a. Lysosomal exocytosis was unaffected by beta blockers. In partial explanation of the enhancement of granulocyte activation by beta blockade, we observed that propranolol produced enhanced expression and affinity of granulocyte surface receptors for tritiated N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. This enhanced activation of human granulocytes by beta blockers was manifest in vivo as augmented inflammatory dermal edema. Enhanced granulocyte activation by beta blockade may induce microvascular disruption and subsequent tissue inflammation.\r"

Measurements of factor V, factor VIII, fibrin degradation products, and fibrinogen in animals transfused with membrane ruled out intravascular coagulation and suggested a direct effect of platelet membrane vesicles at the bleeding sites. This conclusion was supported morphologically by identification of membrane vesicles in bleeding time lesions and radiologically by accumulation of 111In-labeled vesicles in lesions. Production of platelet membrane vesicles was simple, and freezing allowed long-term storage of a product capable of short-term hemostasis.\r"

Rats were fed one of two copper-deficient diets based on either evaporated milk or powdered milk. Compared with control values, liver copper content, liver superoxide dismutase activity, and plasma ceruloplasmin level were significantly decreased in copper-deficient rats fed either of the diets. Liver glutathione peroxidase activity was also decreased in the copper-deficient rats fed the evaporated milk diet. Ethane evolution was markedly increased in both copper-deficient groups as compared with their controls. Copper deficiency was also found to produce increases in hepatic iron concentrations, but normal rats loaded with iron dextran to increase hepatic iron concentrations into a range similar to that found in the copper-deficient rats did not exhibit increased ethane evolution after CCl4 administration. Copper deficiency in the rat results in increased CCl4-induced lipid peroxidation.\r"

After 3 days in storage the size and number of thrombi on damaged surfaces decreased. However, the percentage of vascular surface covered was not reduced significantly until the cells had been stored for 14 days. Treatment of vascular segments with chymotrypsin to increase thrombogenicity caused platelets stored for 14 days to adhere and form aggregates on denuded surfaces in a manner similar to that of fresh platelets, but the ability to develop thrombi remained depressed. Thus long-term storage that maintains physical and functional integrity also preserves a reasonable capacity of platelets to interact with damaged blood vessels.\r"

Results of preliminary dose-response experiments appeared to indicate that nanomolar levels of lithium stimulated clonal proliferation of granulocyte precursors from normal bone marrow in vitro, suggesting the possibility that this element may contribute to the physiologic regulation of blood cell formation in humans. The present studies confirm that the influence of lithium on hematopoiesis is evident in vitro at concentrations equivalent to that demonstrable in normal blood (2 to 4 X 10(-7) mol/L). Furthermore, such effects are not cell lineage specific, being observed also in clonogenic cultures of erythroid and eosinophil granulocyte progenitor cells, and the phenomenon attributed to lithium is a property shared with rubidium and cesium salts. These findings point to a role for lithium and its elemental relatives in the biophysical mechanisms involved with the control of human blood cell production.\r"

The release of this chemotactic activity can be inhibited by pretreating alveolar macrophages with anti-C5 antibody. We hypothesized that C5a, a fragment cleaved from C5 when C5 is activated, might activate the alveolar macrophage to release neutrophil chemotactic activity and that chemotactic factor inactivator, a serum inhibitor of C5a, could decrease this release. Activated complement components including C5a were found to stimulate guinea pig macrophages to release chemotactic activity into their culture supernatants at levels that were significantly higher than the chemotactic activity of C5a alone (P less than 0.001). Chemotactic factor inactivator was found to cause a marked reduction in the chemotactic activity released by macrophages stimulated with phagocytic and nonphagocytic stimuli (P less than 0.001, all comparisons). These data indicate that C5a can stimulate alveolar macrophages to release chemotactic activity in vitro, and that chemotactic factor inactivator may play a role in modulating this process.\r"

To study the possible influence of glomerular ADPase activity on experimentally induced intraglomerular platelet aggregation, we carried out alternate perfusion experiments with human platelets and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) solution in rat kidneys ex vivo. This was done in rats with reduced glomerular phosphatase activity induced by either an intravenous injection of doxorubicin (8.5 mg/kg body weight) or local x-irradiation (2000 rads) as well as in rats with normal glomerular enzyme activity, that is, untreated rats or rats injected intravenously with aminonucleoside of puromycin (PAN) (15 mg/kg body weight). It is shown that in kidneys of both doxorubicin-treated and x-irradiated rats intraglomerular platelet aggregation occurs in approximately 50% of the glomeruli, whereas in PAN-treated or control rats no platelet aggregation could be detected by light microscopy. Activated platelets (by electron microscopy) and beta-thromboglobulin or platelet factor 4 (immunofluorescence microscopy) could be detected with appropriate fluorescinated antibodies along the GBM exclusively in kidneys with reduced ADPase activity caused by doxorubicin or x-irradiation treatment. Because glomerular ADPase activity in contrast to other putative antithrombotic molecules in the GBM, that is, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, is clearly affected by doxorubicin or x-irradiation treatment, it is suggested that the activity of glomerular ADPase may reflect an important antithrombotic principle in the GBM of the rat kidney.\r"

At any time point, the total amounts of either labeled DPPC or CHOL that appeared in lung lymph were small fractions (less than 0.5%) of their respective amounts in plasma. Labeled DPPC, as DPPC alone or as DPPC/CHOL (2:1 molar ratio), appeared simultaneously in plasma and lymph and displayed the same time course of appearance regardless of vesicle composition. CHOL appearance was also simultaneous in both plasma and lymph, but was distinctly slower than that of DPPC. The time differences noted between the appearance of labeled DPPC and CHOL in lymph and plasma indicate that these two lipid components of the instilled surfactant lipid component vesicles appear to be handled in different fashions during their transport from the lung. Further, the data obtained by sampling lung lymph suggest that the lung interstitial space may not play an active role in the transport of exogenously administered lipid from the lung.\r"

  ".W": "Activated neutrophils (AN) when incubated with red blood cells (RBCs) at a ratio of 1:100 were shown to damage RBCs as reflected by an increase in passive potassium (K+) permeability. Oxygenated sickle cells were more susceptible to this injury than normal (AA) RBCs. In both normal and sickle cells, the degree of K+ leak was found to be linearly related to the amount of AN in the incubation mixture. Pretreatment of AA RBCs with low-dose H2O2 resulted in an increased K+ leak after exposure to AN. Compared with patients with stable sickle cell anemia, those who were observed while infected or in crisis had notably more K+ leak from their RBCs after AN exposure. Addition of activated neutrophils from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease resulted in K+ leak from normal RBCs, despite a deficiency in production of toxic oxygen species. Cell-free supernatants from AN also mediated K+ leak. Sickle cells were, again, leakier after exposure to these preparations. Scavengers of toxic oxygen species inhibited up to 40% of the leak, whereas the maximal inhibition obtained by using protease inhibitors was 60%. Addition of autologous plasma in low concentrations inhibited the leak but also resulted in hemolysis, probably via a different mechanism. These studies demonstrate that measurement of passive K+ loss from RBCs allows discrimination between two separate mechanisms of AN-induced damage, an oxidant mechanism, as has been previously described, and a new pathway that appears to be mediated by granule-associated enzymes released from AN. The increased susceptibility of sickle RBCs, especially during periods of increased physiologic stress, suggests that previous membrane damage in vivo may render these RBCs more sensitive to the action of either oxidants or granules released from neutrophils.\r"

Manometric studies were performed when the subjects were in the basal state and after intravenous administration of edrophonium and atropine. Simultaneous radionuclide studies were done with subjects in the supine position by swallows of 250 mu Ci technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid in 10 ml water. We found that normal liquid bolus transport (less than 15 seconds) is primarily dependent on the presence of a peristaltic wave front throughout the esophagus. Above a threshold pressure of 30 mm Hg, liquid transport was not affected by amplitude (33 to 500 mm Hg) or duration (3 to 15 seconds) of esophageal contractions. Repetitive wave forms also gave normal transit times as long as the wave front was peristaltic in onset. There was a significant inverse correlation (-0.65; P less than 0.001) between liquid transit time and peristaltic velocity. Prolonged radionuclide transport (30 to less than 50 seconds) was observed only with nonperistaltic contractions and very low amplitude (15 to 30 mm Hg) peristaltic waves.\r"

Significant increases were found in the levels of calcium, sulphur, and phosphorus in the abnormal hair cells. It is suggested that the high calcium levels might be due to the inhibition of enzymes which normally keep cytoplasmic calcium low, and that some of the changes in the stereocilia might be secondary to this.\r"

Of 14 symptomatic recurrences of acute otitis media, eight (57 percent) occurred within one week of discontinuing antibiotic therapy. Four (10 percent) of 41 children with persistent otitis media with effusion on days 10 to 14 developed symptomatic acute otitis media over the next 18 days, as did four (17 percent) of 23 children who had a normal middle ear examination on days 10 to 14. Early follow-up visits immediately following antibiotic therapy commonly detect persistent otitis media with effusion but appear to have limited value in detecting asymptomatic, posttreatment acute otitis media. the optimal timing of reevaluation visits for children with acute otitis media deserves further study.\r"

These ten patients, compared with the other 27 diabetic burn patients, were more likely to be men younger than 45 years old, to have insulin-dependent diabetes, and to have been burned during self-treatment.

Over a three-year period, there were 6,856 deliveries, of which 713 (10.4 percent) were attended by family physicians. Overall, there were 301 (4.4 percent) cases with adverse outcomes, of which 32 (10.6 percent) were attended by family physicians. The charts of a weighted random sample of 117 cases with adverse outcomes and 468 controls were reviewed to determine potential risk factors, including prenatal risk status, race, insurance, and specialty of the attending physician. The risk ratio for family physician as attending was 0.99 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 1.42) after multivariate adjustment for the other risk factors. Only high prenatal risk status was found to be an independent predictor (risk ratio 1.75, 95 percent confidence interval, 1.23 to 2.49). A chart review of a random sample of 146 patients (73 each of family physicians and obstetricians) revealed no difference in the proportion of high-risk patients in each specialty. It is concluded that in the setting studied, specialty is not a risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes, and that this finding is not confounded by the patient's prenatal risk status.\r"

  ".W": "A literature review on the quality of obstetric care in family practice was conducted to determine whether family physicians are as competent in providing obstetric care as obstetricians. Three types of studies were reviewed: case series, historical cohorts, and population-based studies. No conclusion on the quality of obstetric care in family practice can be drawn from the available studies because of research design limitations. Available evidence suggests, however, that family physicians are as safe as obstetricians when delivering babies, particularly when they concentrate their efforts on providing personal prenatal care, refer high-risk pregnant women appropriately, and practice less technologically oriented care on women who deliver normal-weight babies. In addition, no evidence emerged that family physicians provided significantly poorer obstetric care than obstetricians. In fact, the results from population-based studies suggest that family physicians may be safer than obstetricians in delivering normal-weight infants because of their hypothesized less use of technological interventions in that low-risk group of patients. Further studies, especially prospective randomized trials in which the outcomes are assessed in a blinded fashion and case mix is rigorously controlled, are needed to provide a definitive answer. As practical, ethical, and economic constraints are likely to preclude such studies, the case-control design may provide a reasonable alternative.\r"

Commonly applied measures, usual provider of care (UPC), continuity of care (COC), and the modified continuity index (MCI), either ignore key aspects of continuity or provide misleading results. Consequently, a new measure of continuity, the modified, modified continuity index (MMCI), with a possible range of 0 to 1, was developed to overcome these problems. It was applied to a residency model practice, in which mean MMCI was found to be 0.59 (range 0.3 to 1.0). Mean COC was .41 and a mean MCI was .44. Thus, unlike COC and MCI, MMCI suggests fairly good continuity of care in this practice while still implying possible improvement. The MMCI should be useful for enhancing training and practice of family medicine.\r"

In the context of the physician-patient relationship many of the patient's psychological needs, wishes, and fears will be revealed, and these factors have bearing upon compliance and the ability to make use of patient education. When the physician develops a psychotherapeutic attitude characterized by empathic attunement to the patient and his or her underlying psychological reasons for resistance to medical advice, the likelihood of accepting patient education increases.\r"

Despite this high level of involvement with these patients, the majority of family physicians consider their training in the management of patients with mental disorders to be inadequate. This paper describes six categories of critical competencies that should be included in the mental health curricula of family physician training programs: therapeutic attitudes and skills, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, functional assessment, psychopharmacology, management of emergencies, and psychosocial treatments. It outlines the manner in which specific competencies could be incorporated in medical school, in family practice residency training, and in postgraduate continuing medical education as well as the specific elements included in each. The discussion is based on the assumption that more effective participation by family physicians in the treatment of chronic psychiatric illness requires active attention throughout the continuum of medical education.\r"

Next, using a 26-item patient satisfaction questionnaire, 436 patients from a single group of providers in the same family health center seen six months after the programs began were randomly surveyed. Sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of prepaid and fee-for-service patients were similar for both groups in the chart audit. There was no statistically significant difference between the overall satisfaction levels of prepaid and fee-for-service patients. Individual constructs that comprise general satisfaction were also statistically similar except for an unexpected finding of dissimilar levels of satisfaction with \"physician conduct/humaneness\" (P less than .05). Assessed from at least one standpoint, cost containment does not seem to affect overall quality of care, but further investigation is needed, especially in the realm of \"physician conduct/humaneness.\"\r"

A spectrum of severity of panic disorder was found. A subgroup of patients, labeled in the study as having simple panic, was found to have anxiety attacks associated with four or more autonomic symptoms, but they did not meet DSM-III recurrence criteria (three anxiety attacks within a 3-week period). Compared to primary care patients without panic attacks, patients with both simple panic and panic disorder exhibited multiple phobias, avoidance behavior, a high lifetime risk of major depression, and elevated scores on self-rating scales of anxiety and depression. The four autonomic screening questions that the authors added to the DIS interview increased the sensitivity of the DIS in identifying patients with panic disorder. Patients with panic disorder who selectively focus on their frightening autonomic symptoms may not be identified by screen questions that only focus on the cognitive awareness of anxiety.\r"

Hypochondriacal patients reported more fears of and false beliefs about disease; they attended more to bodily sensations, had more fears about death, and distrusted physicians' judgments more, yet sought more medical care than other subjects. They did not take better precautions about their health. The self-report of overt attitudes suggests a characteristic syndrome, consistent with the DSM-III description of hypochondriasis.

Data gathered through use of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule at the Duke, Johns Hopkins, Washington, and Yale University sites indicate that each criterion set identifies a somewhat different group of respondents. Feighner criteria identify the fewest number of respondents, followed by DSM-III criteria and the Research Diagnostic Criteria. Demographic, symptomatic, health utilization, and other severity indices indicate that the respondents identified by each group are very similar and that all diagnostic groups are clearly distinguishable from the normal population.\r"

The first is that the supposed exaggerated winter birthrate among process schizophrenics actually represents a reduction in spring-fall births caused by prenatal exposure to infectious diseases during the preceding winter--i.e., a high prenatal death rate in process preschizophrenic fetuses. The second is that the level of negative symptoms in survivors at risk for schizophrenia who were born after winters with high infectious disease rates is exaggerated. The findings provided some tentative support for this formulation. Compared with counterparts born after low-disease winters, schizophrenics born after winters with high disease incidences tended to show lower (more reactive) scores on a measure of the process-reaction dimension but higher anhedonia scores.\r"

  ".U": "87111495\r", 
  ".W": "In recent years reforms were instituted in the Federal Republic of Germany that were designed to facilitate the integration of psychiatric services and psychiatric patients into community life. One goal of this reform was to reduce patients' feelings of stigmatization. Because such feelings were thought to arise through patients' tenure at large, isolated state hospitals, we hypothesized that patients sent to such hospitals would feel more stigmatized than would patients assigned to a modern, integrated university hospital. Further, we hypothesized that patients in the two settings would adopt different strategies to cope with the stigma they perceived and that staff members in the two settings would share patients' views concerning these matters. Although we found that the staff in both hospitals shared our prediction that state hospital patients would perceive more stigmatization, our findings showed just the opposite. State hospital patients were significantly less likely than university hospital patients to believe that most people would devalue and discriminate against mental patients. Nor did we find strong evidence of different styles of coping with stigma among patients in the two settings. Taken together, our results suggest that in the realm of stigmatization well-intentioned efforts of reforms may have had undesirable unanticipated consequences. Given this, we suggest approaches for intervening more directly with patients in the form of \"Daily Living Groups,\" which are designed to explicitly discuss actual and feared stigmatization.\r"

The high LSHS-A scorers and the hallucinating psychiatric patients were significantly more likely to hear suggested sounds than were their respective controls. High LSHS-A scorers were also significantly more likely to see suggested objects than were their respective controls, although this finding was not replicated in the psychiatric subjects.

Associations between negative symptoms and these clinical and drug variables were examined using a multivariate statistical model. Negative symptoms were significantly correlated with several parkinsonian symptoms, some vegetative features of depression, and with anticholinergic dose. No significant correlations were found between negative symptoms and cognitive features of depression, or neuroleptic and anticholinergic plasma activity. These findings suggest that assessment criteria for negative symptoms, depression, and drug-induced parkinsonism overlap in treated schizophrenics.

The panic disorder group used proportionately less problem-focused and more wishful thinking than the other groups. Within the panic disorder group, anxiety and depression were correlated negatively with problem-focused coping and positively with wishful thinking, and number of phobias was correlated negatively with the seeking of social support and positively with wishful thinking. Most importantly, when an attempt was made to statistically separate panic patients with multiple phobias from those without multiple phobias, coping was a better marker than was distress. These results emphasize the importance of cognitions in illness behavior and anxiety disorder.\r"

The relaxation times, T1 and T2 increase progressively as the oedema develops, and the proportional increase in T2 is approximately twice that in T1. Analysis of the magnetisation decay curves reveals slowly-relaxing and rapidly-relaxing components which probably correspond to oedema fluid and intracellular water respectively. The image appearances taken in conjunction with relaxation data provide a basis for determining the nature of the oedema in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of head injuries to neuropsychological deficits was studied in 157 recently detoxified alcoholics and 400 control subjects consisting of age-stratified randomly selected men and women from the same geographical area as the alcoholics. Head injuries had occurred in 41% and 22% of the male and female alcoholics, but only in 15% and 6% of the male and female control subjects. One third of the injured subjects in both groups had been admitted to hospital for treatment of the acute injury. The neuropsychological test results of alcoholics were significantly inferior to those of control subjects. Unexpectedly, alcoholics with head injuries not identified at hospital were significantly inferior in several Halstead-Reitan subtests when compared with uninjured alcoholics with a similar duration of alcoholism and abstinence. By contrast, control subjects who had sustained a head injury not identified at hospital did not show signs of intellectual impairment when compared with uninjured controls. We conclude that traumatic brain injuries that may cause significant intellectual impairment may easily remain unrecognised in alcoholics.\r"

Neuropsychological examination revealed severe cognitive impairments in the first two patients. Cognitive functioning was essentially intact in the third patient, although her work pace was significantly slowed. CT scanning of the brain showed cortical atrophy as well as white matter lesions in patients 1 and 2, and multiple lesions and oedema of predominantly white matter in patient 3. The differences of cognitive dysfunction between the third and the first two patients may be related to involvement of different anatomical structures.\r"

Ventricular fluid pressure, the amplitude of spectral components of the CSF pulse and the amplitude of transfer function in the supratentorial compartment were increased in an exponential manner as epidural compression advanced. A transtentorial pressure gradient developed when epidural compression exceeded a critical level. Conduction of the CSF pulse through the tentorial hiatus decreased in an exponential manner when plotted against the transtentorial pressure gradient. Transtentorial conduction of the CSF pulse may serve as a sensitive indicator of the development of tentorial herniation.\r"

Concentrations of homovanillic acid were also significantly lower in Parkinsonian patients (p less than 0.05). In contrast, no changes were observed in the acetylcholinesterase activity of patients with Parkinson's disease. The reduced somatostatin-like immunoreactivity in CSF agrees with previous post-mortem studies and indicates that Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease may have some neurochemical features in common.\r"

The amplitude of the EMG bursts and their frequency of occurrence, was less in patients off drug treatment and immobile, than when mobile on therapy.

  ".U": "87111612\r", 
  ".W": "Photosensitivity is the most common mode of seizure precipitation. It is age-related, more frequent in females, and most often found in generalised epilepsies. Little is known about its relation to individual epileptic syndromes. This study on 1062 epileptic patients who had 4007 split screen video EEG investigations revealed that the relation to generalised epilepsy is even more close than generally believed. Versive seizures with visual hallucinations was the only focal seizure type related to photosensitivity. Of the syndromes of generalised epilepsy, only childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and epilepsy with grand mal on awakening were related to photosensitivity. The closest correlation was with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. This is confirmed by a relation to the poly-spike wave pattern, and by an increase of myoclonic seizures by intermittent light stimuli. No relation was found with early childhood syndromes of generalised epilepsy, or generalised tonic-clonic seizures in the evening, or, most remarkably, with juvenile absence epilepsy. In generalised epilepsies with onset around puberty, photosensitivity could thus act as a pathoplastic factor. The female preponderance in both childhood absences and photosensitivity could be due to the same unknown factor.\r"

Significantly greater reductions in P100 latency occurred in the multiple sclerosis patients than in controls and normalisation of the half-field response topography occurred in one patient after hyperventilation. The VEP changes are attributed to improved impulse transmission in demyelinated fibres in the visual pathway as a result of the alkalosis and changes in ionised calcium levels induced by hyperventilation.\r"

This was studied in 38 asymptomatic control subjects and 20 women with neurogenic faecal incontinence, supplemented by determination of the mean motor unit potential duration (MUPD) of the external anal sphincter and anorectal manometry. The reflex latency in the control group was 38.5 +/- 5.8 (SD) ms and appeared to be independent of age or sex. Three patients with faecal incontinence had absent reflexes; the remainder showed significant prolongation of latency (56 +/- 12.2 SD ms) and diminution of amplitude. MUPD was prolonged in incontinence and showed significant correlation with the corresponding reflex latency determination (tau = 0.56, p less than 0.001). The latency of this polysynaptic spinal reflex hence provides a reliable index of neuropathy of the external anal sphincter.\r"

After PTA their neurological and vascular conditions were serially examined. Of the 13 patients, 8 showed marked improvement of both subjective and objective clinical symptoms. During an observation period of 2-25 months (average: 15 months) reocclusion of the angioplasty was observed in only 2 cases, without any additional neurological sequelae.

  ".W": "In a patient with the stiff-man syndrome, abnormal exteroceptive reflexes in hand and arm muscles were used as a tool for investigating the effects of various centrally acting adrenergic drugs by means of acute testing. Clonidine, tizanidine and methamphetamine induced reflex suppression whereas reserpine had a biphasic effect: transient reflex suppression and delayed reflex enhancement. The drug actions on the reflexes paralleled to some degree those on the muscle stiffness. It is concluded that alpha-adrenergic stimulation leads to reflex suppression and muscular relaxation, whereas alpha-adrenergic blockade has the opposite effect. Correspondingly, long-term oral treatment with the alpha-stimulator, tizanidine, proved successful. The hypothesis is put forward that a noradrenergic system which exerts a net inhibitory influence on muscle tone and on exteroceptive reflexes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the stiff-man syndrome.\r"

The basic feature of myonecrosis was dissolution of myofilaments with resultant fine granular or filamentous material. The disintegrating cytoplasm often contained numerous glycogen granules, dense bodies, autophagic vacuoles and myelin-like membranous bodies. A well-developed sarcoplasmic reticulum was preserved despite myofilament dissolution, while mitochondria showed marked swelling. The nuclei showed either dilution of chromatin or pyknotic change. The basal lamina was remarkably thickened and maintained an irregular outline of the necrotic smooth muscle cells. Enlarged intercellular space contained abundant cellular debris, vesicular structures and connective tissue fibres. The pathogenesis of these changes is discussed.\r"

The discrimination of both fractions was performed according to an empirical approach analogous to the immunoglobulins. Only 47% of the intraparenchymal carcinomas released CEA into the CSF compartment and it is possible that the extra-cellular space of these tumour sites does not communicate with the free CSF space. Extradural metastases may cause an impairment of the blood-CSF barrier via restrictions of the CSF fluid turnover, but the dura remains impermeable for the tumour marker. Seven out of 54 primary brain tumours (13%) released carcinoembryonic antigen into the cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

  ".W": "Advancing age is associated with poorer prognosis in malignant melanoma. We studied 3,872 cases of malignant melanoma to evaluate whether the effect of age could be analyzed relative to sex, tumor depth, primary site, and other clinical and pathologic variables. The sex distribution by age shows a slight female predominance in the early and late decades but male predominance in the middle years. The percentage of patients with metastatic disease at initial diagnosis did not vary with age, despite greater diameter and depth of lesions in the older patients. In fact, in the older age groups, initial nodal metastasis occurred slightly less frequently. Trunk primaries decreased in frequency with increasing age, while extremity lesions remained relatively constant, and face, nose, and ear lesions increased. This was in part related to the histopathologic type, as lentigo maligna lesions increased in frequency with age, superficial spreading lesions were somewhat less frequent in the older age group and nodular types were fairly constant. On the basis of both Clark's level and Breslow thickness, there was an increasing proportion of deeper penetrating lesions in the older age group. The mean diameter of these lesions on the skin surface was also greater for the older patients. This would suggest that lesions in the older individual remain confined to the local site longer, penetrate and spread, but do not necessarily metastasize more rapidly. Cox model regression analysis of survival time within stage showed that age was highly significant as a poor prognostic factor. Though the adverse relation of advancing age with survival was partially explained by predominance of other unfavorable factors, such as primary site, depth of lesion, or histologic type, age remained an independent poor prognostic factor (chi 2 = 5.3; P = .02) for death due to melanoma.\r"

Stage 0 patients accounted for 190 of the patient population (75.5%), while stage A and B1 comprised 51 (20%) and 11 (4.5%), respectively. The median follow-up time was 62 months. Forty-three patients subsequently developed deep muscle invasion; these included 24 (12.6%), 14 (27.5%), and 5 (45.5%) of stage 0, A, and B1 patients (P = .002), or 15 (10%), 15 (9%), and 13 (33%) of grade 1, 2, and 3 tumors (P = .001), respectively. When analyzed by univariate logistic regression, grade (P = .0001) and stage (P = .0118) were significant predictors for invasive disease. Site of tumor and number of tumors at presentation were not significant factors for invasion deep into the bladder wall. When multiple logistic regression was performed, only grade remained as a significant tumor variable to predict for invasive disease (P less than .0091). Risk of invasive disease did not appear to increase with increasing number of recurrences, remaining at approximately an 11% invasion rate through 12 recurrences. In this analysis, grade was the most significant tumor variable in superficial bladder cancer predicting for the development of invasive carcinoma. Future clinical trials for definitive or adjuvant therapy of this disease must stratify for this variable.\r"

A recently available totally implantable venous access system offers advantages over traditional central vein catheters (Broviac and Hickman, Houston).

The mean age of the patients was 7 years (range, 6 months to 17 years), and the mean indwelling time of the catheters was 232 days (range, 14 to 607 days; total patient days, 7,198). The catheters were used to administer chemotherapy, drugs, blood products, and parenteral nutrition, as well as to draw blood. Clotting occurred in the catheters on four occasions, requiring removal of two catheters. Fever occurred in eight patients; one developed a local infection at the site of implantation and four developed bacteremia. Our use of the implanted venous access system in children resulted in a lower rate of infection compared with that when the traditional Broviac and Hickman catheters were used, and simplified patient management.\r"

Treatment consisted of comprehensive wide field radiotherapy to all known areas of disease. Doses administered to these fields ranged from 1,700 to 5,000 rad, with only three patients (18%) receiving less than 3,000 rad to any field. With a median follow-up of over 4 years, 88% achieved a complete response, with median actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) of 19 months (range, 4 to 61+). Actuarial median survival was 64 months, with a range of 4 to 134+ months. Nine patients (53%) are currently alive with three (18%) in continuous complete remission (CR) for 24, 30, and 61 months. In addition, four patients relapsing after salvage radiotherapy are now in CR following additional therapy. Patients younger than 35 years of age had a significantly increased overall survival when compared with older patients (P less than .005). An initial complete response to chemotherapy lasting 12 or more months appeared to be a favorable prognostic factor, although small patient numbers preclude statistical significance. Comprehensive salvage radiotherapy is of significant benefit in patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease relapsing after combination chemotherapy in nodal and/or pulmonary sites.\r"

However, both estrogen receptor (ER) status and axillary lymph node status at diagnosis, as well as the length of the disease-free interval, provide additional independent information for predicting patient survival after disease recurrence. Involved axillary lymph nodes at the time of initial diagnosis and/or lack of ERs may indicate a highly malignant tumor or a weak host defense, either of which might be related to short survival after relapse. Patients with ER-negative tumors recurred more often in visceral and soft-tissue sites, while patients with ER-positive tumors were more likely to recur in bony sites. However, for each metastatic site, receptor-positive patients had longer survival\r"

This study was designed to determine whether this routine screening resulted in significant survival benefit for the patient. The medical records of 1,230 women treated for cure of invasive carcinoma of the breast were reviewed, and 248 cases of recurrence were identified for analysis. Only 36% of recurrences were discovered asymptomatically. Asymptomatic recurrence was associated with favorable biologic factors, ie, more frequent estrogen receptor (ER) positivity and initial node negative status, and survival was superior to that of others. This was particularly true for occult local recurrence. However, compliance with a present schedule of examinations did not confer superior survival. It was concluded that (1) routine screening after mastectomy detects few recurrences that are not already symptomatic, and (2) the superior survival associated with discovery of occult recurrence may result from the influences of lead time and length bias.\r"

  ".W": "Primary breast cancer treatment is determined by tumor factors and by patient preference. Breast cancer treatments that preserve the cosmetic appearance of the breast are appealing and effective for appropriately selected patients; long-term survival following tumor excision and breast irradiation appears to be comparable to that for mastectomy. Since April 1981, when a protocol was developed and treatment options were offered, factors influencing treatment selection have been analyzed in 206 consecutive primary breast cancer patients. Mastectomy was dictated by tumor-related factors in 96 patients (47%); 110 patients (53%) had the option of mastectomy or conservation--tumor excision plus radiotherapy to the breast. Among these 110 eligible patients, 54 chose conservation (49%) and 56 chose mastectomy (51%). Intraoperative findings for ten patients electing conservation necessitated mastectomy, so conservation was accomplished for 44 (21%) of those treated for breast cancer. Beginning in July 1982, breast cancer patients took a battery of psychosexual assessments before any operation (Profile of Mood States [POMS], Health Locus of Control Scale [HLCS] Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test [MAT], Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale [PAIS], Derogatis Sexual Function Inventory [DSFI], Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory [MCMI], and a Breast Cancer Information Test [BCIT]). Comparisons of psychologic and demographic variables were made between patients who chose mastectomy and those who chose conservation. No demographic variable was statistically significantly related to choice, although older women tended to select mastectomy more than younger women. Compared with those who elected conservation, women who elected mastectomy were more tense and anxious (P less than .01), more introverted (P less than .01), felt more depressed and dejected (P less than .05), and reported more sexual problems (P less than .05). Those who elected conservation valued their physical appearance more highly (P less than .01) and were generally more self-interested (P less than .05). Mastectomy was dictated by medical considerations for approximately half of patients with breast cancer. Among candidates for breast conservation, the importance of retaining the breast appeared to be determined to a significant degree by measurable psychological factors.\r"

Forty-one patients with refractory solid tumors received menogaril during a phase I trial at The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center (Baltimore). Menogaril was administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 and 8 of a 28-day cycle in doses of 8 to 140 mg/m2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) grade 3 and 4 leukopenia was the principle dose-limiting toxicity and was occasionally accompanied by thrombocytopenia. Both WBC and platelet nadirs occurred between days 15 and 22. Anemia requiring transfusion was occasionally seen. Nonhematologic toxicities observed included frequent anorexia and malaise that was not dose related and postinfusion phlebitis that was dose related and occasionally dose limiting. Gastrointestinal toxicity and alopecia were infrequent and mild in severity. Three patients with cumulative doses of menogaril greater than 1,400 mg/m2 had no significant changes in ejection fractions as determined by serial gated blood pool scans. Two patients had greater than 10% decrements in ejection fractions without clinical changes at total doses of 128 and 288 mg/m2. One patient with prior anthracycline therapy and chest irradiation decreased her left ventricular ejection fraction from 52% to 30% and developed respiratory failure after two cycles of therapy in the setting of disease progression. No responses to menogaril therapy were observed. The recommended phase II dose for menogaril on this day 1 and 8 schedule is 140 mg/m2. A starting dose of 90 mg/m2 should be considered for heavily pretreated patients. In comparing results of this phase I schedule with those of other schedules, evidence for schedule-dependent toxicity differences should be sought.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-six women with metastatic breast cancer were treated with intensive Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) as a single agent administered for three successive days once a month. Dosing started at 25 or 30 mg/m2/d three times, and was escalated by 5 mg/m2/d monthly to maximal tolerance based on hematologic, mucosal, or cardiac toxicities. Four patients (15%) had complete remissions (CRs) pathologically proven, and six others (23%) sustained complete CRs, but were found to have microscopic residual tumor (three) or refused biopsy (three). Twelve patients (46%) attained partial remission (PR). The overall response (85%) and CR rates (38%) were approximately double those reported with conventional Adriamycin doses. Median unmaintained remission duration for the ten patients in CR was 11 months. Cardiotoxicity, determined by radionuclide physiologic studies, occurred in 16 patients at a mean dose of 459 mg/m2; three patients developed reversible congestive failure. There were no toxic deaths. The median overall survival was 18 months. These data suggest that there is steep dose responsiveness to Adriamycin in metastatic breast cancer, and that more effective techniques for using Adriamycin may exist than those conventionally used.\r"

  ".W": "The disposition of the synthetic corticosteroids, dexamethasone and prednisolone, in CSF was evaluated following bolus intravenous (IV) and intrathecal (IT) injection in a nonhuman primate model. Steroid concentration in plasma and CSF was measured with a radioimmunoassay following celite column chromatography. The CSF to plasma ratios of dexamethasone and prednisolone following IV bolus administration were 0.15 +/- 0.02 and 0.08 +/- 0.03, respectively. Although peak levels of the two steroids in the CSF reached equally potent levels when administered systemically in equipotent doses, the half-life of prednisolone in the CSF was shorter. In addition, there was a significant difference in the plasma protein binding of the two steroids, which may account for the differences in their CSF pharmacokinetics. Dexamethasone was 70% protein bound over a wide concentration range, while the protein binding of prednisolone was concentration dependent, ranging from 60% at 10 mumol/L to 95% at 0.5 mumol/L and below. After the initial distribution phase in plasma, CSF concentrations of dexamethasone and prednisolone approximated free plasma concentrations, indicating that penetration into the CSF was limited primarily by protein binding. At the plasma concentrations achieved following oral administration of standard doses of prednisone in children, the prednisolone (the active metabolite) is greater than 90% protein bound. The proportionally higher free plasma levels of dexamethasone result in greater penetration into the CSF. These findings may explain the lower rates of meningeal leukemia observed in children receiving dexamethasone instead of prednisone for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\r"

  ".W": "We used magnetic resonance (MR) to image the bone marrow of 31 patients with lymphoma. Images were obtained of the femoral, pelvic, and vertebral marrow with a 0.15 tesla imaging system using a T1-weighted spin echo sequence (TR600/TE 40). With this pulse sequence, normal marrow produces a high intensity signal that reflects the presence of marrow fat (short T1 relaxation time). We previously reported MR imaging of patients with leukemia in relapse and found a diffusely and symmetrically decreased marrow signal intensity due to the replacement of normal marrow fat by cellular material with a long T1. Unlike leukemia, patients with lymphomatous marrow involvement often had patchy, often discrete, areas of low signal intensity, representing focal marrow infiltration. Five of six patients in this study with lymphoma detected by histologic examination also had marrow lesions seen on MR. An additional four patients had marrow lesions detected by MR that were not detected on initial marrow biopsies; two of these had marrow involvement proven on subsequent biopsies, one had disease isolated to the vertebrae that was never pathologically documented, and one had progression of disease in the marrow documented by MR without biopsy confirmation. These results indicate that marrow involvement with lymphoma can be detected by MR imaging and that MR can complement bone marrow biopsy.\r"

Pretreatment sperm concentration, fresh motility, fresh progression, postthaw motility and postthaw progression were all significantly decreased in men with Hodgkin's disease compared with normal controls. Posttreatment semen analysis in 44 men showed azoospermia in 80%, sperm concentration, less than or equal to 10 X 10(6)/mL in 11%, and sperm concentration greater than 10 X 10(6)/mL in 9%. Eleven couples attempted artificial insemination using cryopreserved semen, thus far resulting in three pregnancies. Semen cryopreservation and artificial insemination offer a partial solution to posttreatment azoospermia in this population, but further methods are needed to minimize gonadal toxicity without compromising therapy for Hodgkin's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Postmortem material from 537 patients included in various protocols of intensive combination chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for the management of small-cell anaplastic carcinoma of the lung (SCLC) has been reviewed. Patterns of residual or recurrent disease were analyzed in relation to pretreatment clinical parameters. Residual primary tumor (P less than .05), regional lymph node involvement (P less than .01), hepatic (P less than .01), bone (P less than .05), and renal metastases (P less than .05) were all significantly less frequent among patients with initially limited-stage disease compared with extensively staged patients. The frequency of residual intrathoracic tumor and metastatic pattern did not significantly differ between partial responders (PRs) and nonresponders (NRs). Patients with limited disease achieving a complete remission had a lower frequency of intrathoracic tumor (P less than .001) at autopsy compared with limited-stage PRs. However, for extensive-stage patients the pattern of residual disease was essentially independent of tumor response. Prior surgery was associated with a reduced burden of metastases only in those who underwent a radical resection. The addition of radiotherapy to the primary tumor and mediastinum failed to modify the autopsy distribution of residual tumor compared with that in patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Metastatic patterns were similar with or without prophylactic abdominal radiotherapy, while prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCl) did not prevent the development of cerebral metastases in patients whose systemic response to treatment was either partial or nonexistent. However, a beneficial effect of PCl in compete responders (CRs) was not excluded.\r"

All received standard surgery and postoperative radiation therapy. Five patients were taken off study because of unresectability at the time of surgery, leaving 55 evaluable patients. There were no statistically significant imbalances in known prognostic factors between the two treatment arms. MTX was begun at 40 mg/m2 and escalated 10 mg/m2 weekly (four doses preoperatively; four doses postoperatively, preradiation therapy; eight doses postradiation therapy) to mucosal or hematologic toxicity. The median peak MTX dose achieved was 80 mg/m2. Although three patients were hospitalized with MTX toxicity, none died of MTX toxicity. No patient receiving MTX had disease progression during treatment, and there was no increase in postoperative complications. Thirty-two patients died (median survival, 19 months); 23 patients are alive with median follow-up of 43 months. There was no statistically significant difference in actuarial DFS (P = 1.0) or overall survival (P = .61). Although patients on the MTX arm appeared to have less local and regional recurrences at first recurrence (thus more distant metastases), this did not reach statistical significance (P = .06). There was no significant difference between the sites of recurrence at death or last follow-up (P = .38).\r"

Laboratory studies have shown that this drug inhibits bone resorption in vitro and that short-term treatment in vivo increases the calcium content of bone. We evaluated the clinical effects of gallium nitrate on biochemical parameters of increased bone turnover in 22 patients with bone metastases. Treatment with gallium nitrate for five to seven days caused a median reduction in 24-hour urinary calcium excretion of 66% relative to baseline measurements (P less than .01). Hydroxyproline (OHP) excretion was also significantly reduced (P less than .01). The greatest reduction in hydroxyprolinuria occurred in patients with high baseline excretion. Ionized serum calcium and serum phosphorous declined significantly after treatment (P less than .01 for each). Serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (PTH) increased significantly (P less than .01), as did serum levels of 1,25 (OH)2-vitamin D3 (P less than .05). Urinary phosphorous excretion and serum levels of 25-OH-vitamin D3 were not significantly changed. No major toxic reactions occurred as a result of this treatment. These results indicate that gallium nitrate significantly reduces biochemical parameters associated with accelerated bone turnover and that this agent may be useful for preventing pathologic conditions associated with bone metastases.\r"

  ".U": "87111718\r", 
  ".W": "Ultrafilterable platinum (UP) disposition was studied in 22 cancer patients receiving their first course of cisplatin (50 to 140 mg/m2) by two-hour infusion. UP plasma and urinary platinum levels were quantitated using a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay, which was selective for cisplatin and active platinum metabolites. Creatinine clearance was determined in all patients at the time of the pharmacokinetic studies and ranged from 58 to 214 mL/min. Creatinine clearance was a poor predictor of UP disposition in patients, probably as a consequence of the complex renal clearance mechanism for UP in the human kidney, which involves both tubular secretion and reabsorption. However, the peak plasma level of UP was closely related to the area under curve (AUC) of UP (r2 = .831), P less than .0001) and was significantly correlated with the decline in creatinine clearance observed after four courses of cisplatin therapy to 12 of the patients (r2 = .727, P less than .005). Cisplatin dose and the AUC of UP were less satisfactory predictors of the change in creatinine clearance with four courses of therapy (r2 = .488, P less than .025 and r2 = .623, P less than .005). The large interpatient variability in all the parameters of cisplatin disposition measured in this study suggested that there may be a role for individualization of cisplatin dosage based on a peak level obtained in the first course of therapy. Longer term infusion of cisplatin could also be justified.\r"

It is clear that meticulous technique and graft preparation are crucial to short-term and long-term patency. The risk of early thrombosis is related to damage to the graft's native intima, graft flow, and coagulability of the patient's blood. Attention to atraumatic harvesting techniques and perfection of anastomoses are crucial to minimizing intimal damage. Graft inflow and outflow are fundamental principles. The use of vitamin K antagonists and platelet inhibitors may improve graft survival. Subacute occlusion is related to structural alterations in the grafts themselves. These include intimal hyperplasia and medial fibrosis as the grafts become \"arterialized,\" valve fibrosis, aneurysmal dilatation, clamp stenosis, and suture stenosis. Long-term patency is threatened primarily by atherosclerosis in the graft itself. There is some evidence that care in vein harvesting and implantation as well as the use of anticoagulant agents affect the development of this complication. A technique for graft preparation is presented that is based on the experience of the authors in harvesting grafts for both cerebral and coronary bypass conduits.\r"

Prior to treatment, all of the patients had severe rigidity in their lower limbs and most had frequent and extensive spontaneous spasms, all of which greatly interfered with their activities of daily living. Oral antispasmodic medications were ineffective or caused central side effects. The patients underwent implantation of a programmable drug pump connected to a lumbar subarachnoid catheter. Within days of beginning continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion, the muscle tone was reduced to normal levels and spasms were eliminated. Over the ensuing months, muscle tone remained normal, but short-duration spasms could be induced by some activities. The greatest benefits to the patients were improvement in activities of daily living and better sleep due to reduced spasms. The baclofen doses were increased over the first few months but then were stabilized or only increased slightly, with the maximum dose being 650 micrograms/day. The most serious complications were two drug overdoses which took several days to clear up and were due to malfunctions of an earlier pump model. Baclofen clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid occurs with a half-life of 5 hours. The most serious concern in maintaining patients indefinitely on intrathecal baclofen is whether drug tolerance will eventually occur.\r"

Preoperative endocrine evaluation demonstrated that 19 patients had \"typical\" endocrine patterns for pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent hypercortisolism and 11 had \"atypical\" testing. Pituitary pathology was found in 95% of the patients with typical preoperative endocrine testing but in only 55% of those with atypical testing. Eight of 34 preoperative computerized tomography scans demonstrated tumors, which correlated in all instances with the surgical findings. Microadenomas were removed from 25 patients, 22 of whom achieved postoperative remission of endocrine symptoms. Macroadenomas were found in three patients, only one of whom achieved remission after surgery. One patient had removal of an adenoma in the pharyngeal pituitary, and in another an ectopic lung carcinoid was excised; both of these patients were in postoperative remission. Four patients underwent transsphenoidal exploration but no definitive explanation was found for their hypercortisolism; these patients were not in remission. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on every specimen and all tumors showed excessive ACTH-secreting cells. A new rapid stain of the fibrovascular stroma is described.\r"

  ".W": "The majority of hospital admissions for head trauma are due to minor injuries; that is, no or only transient loss of consciousness without major complications and not requiring intracranial surgery. Despite the low mortality rate following minor head injury, there is controversy surrounding the extent of morbidity and the long-term sequelae. The authors postulated that consecutively admitted patients who fulfilled research diagnostic criteria for minor head injury and who were carefully screened for antecedent neuropsychiatric disorder and prior head injury would exhibit subacute cognitive and memory deficits that would resolve over a period of 1 to 3 months postinjury. To evaluate this hypothesis, the neurobehavioral functioning of 57 patients was compared within 1 week after minor head injury (baseline) and at 1 month postinjury with that of 56 selected control subjects at three medical centers. Quantified tests of memory, attention, and information-processing speed revealed that neurobehavioral impairment demonstrated at baseline by all means of measurement generally resolved during the first 3 months after minor head injury. Although nearly all patients initially reported cognitive problems, somatic complaints, and emotional malaise, these postconcussion symptoms had substantially resolved by the 3-month follow-up examination. The data suggest that a single uncomplicated minor head injury produces no permanent disabling neurobehavioral impairment in the great majority of patients who are free of preexisting neuropsychiatric disorder and substance abuse.\r"

  ".W": "Dexamethasone has been used to manage brain edema in patients with intracranial abscess. However, its administration has often been delayed or avoided for fear of adverse effects upon normal host responses to infection. An experimental model of brain abscess in the rat was developed to determine if dexamethasone produced adverse effects on immune competence and collagen deposition in the region of the abscess. Sprague-Dawley rats were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus and treated intraperitoneally each day with either dexamethasone (0.25 mg/kg) or saline solution. Surviving animals were sacrificed at 4, 8, 12, or 18 days after treatment. The brains were examined grossly for abscess formation and microscopically for intensity of the inflammatory response, abscess diameter, and wall thickness. There were no differences in mortality rates, abscess production rates, or abscess diameters when groups were compared. The intensity of inflammatory response was similar in both groups. In the group sacrificed 8 days after inoculation, a delay in collagen deposition was apparent, manifested as a thinner abscess wall in the experimental group (mean: 17.8 mu in dexamethasone-treated animals and 85 mu in saline-treated control animals: p = 1.0041). At 12 and 18 days after inoculation, there was no difference in abscess wall thickness between the control and experimental groups. Therapeutic doses of dexamethasone had little effect on mortality rates, incidence of abscess production, or intensity of inflammatory response in the experimental animals. Thus, dexamethasone did cause a delay in collagen deposition in the walls of experimental brain abscesses, but wall thickness 18 days after inoculation was not affected.\r"

The pressure required to obtain a specific exposure decreased gradually with time. The average time for a 50% reduction in retraction pressure was 6.6 minutes in the earlier trials of repeated retraction. The attenuation rate of retraction pressure gradually decreased when retraction of the same area was repeated. The lower the head position of the dog, the larger was the amplitude of brain retraction pressure. Clinical studies demonstrated that: 1) cerebrospinal fluid drainage was effective in decreasing the retraction pressure required; 2) use of multiple retractors reduced the pressure applied by each retractor; and 3) retraction pressure could be monitored when the strain-gauge retractors were applied to arteries and cranial nerves.\r"

  ".W": "A research model for intracranial surgery in the primate fetus was developed and tested in 10 timed-pregnant rhesus monkeys. With general anesthesia and sterile surgical technique, a laparotomy followed by a lower uterine segment hysterotomy was performed at a site avoiding the placenta. The amnion was opened carefully by use of the operative microscope and the fetal head was exposed. A scalp incision was made over the frontal region and a small craniectomy and cortical incision were carried out. In three of the fetuses, ventricular shunts were also placed. A layered closure was performed and the uterus was returned to the peritoneal cavity. Placental integrity and fetal viability were assessed before surgery and 1 week postoperatively by ultrasonography. The survival rates were 100% for the mothers and 80% for the fetuses. One fetus died in utero after an overdose of a sedative to the mother, and another was stillborn. Postmortem examination revealed no intracranial or systemic abnormalities in either case, and the cause of death was attributed to drug overdose and a naturally occurring stillbirth, respectively. Newborns were maintained either with their mothers or in a nursery, where they were observed and evaluated for 3 weeks. Weight, crown-rump length, and occipitofrontal head circumference were measured. General patterns of behavior and neurological assessments were recorded weekly. The eight surviving neonates were normal with respect to all parameters evaluated. Several principles of fetal intracranial surgery are emphasized as important: uterine relaxation by prostaglandin inhibition; low-dose halothane anesthesia supplemented by nitrous oxide in oxygen; perioperative ultrasonography and intraoperative transillumination of the uterus for placental localization; lower uterine segment opening; controlled exposure of the fetal cranium; minimization of amniotic fluid loss; enhancement of fetal anesthesia by injection of a local anesthetic agent at the fetal operative site; and multilayered watertight closure.\r"

The results showed that the value of [111In]granulocyte scintigraphy in the detection of infectious foci vary in these three types of febrile conditions. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 86.5% and 87.8%, respectively. We observed, however, a relatively low predictive value of a positive result in the fever of unknown origin group (73.1%), and also a low predictive value of a negative result in the bacteremia group (66.7%). The C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in patients with a true-positive scintigram were significantly (p less than 0.001) higher than in patients with a true-negative scintigram. There was also a significant positive correlation (p less than 0.01) between the serum CRP concentration and the intensity of the granulocyte accumulations. There was no correlation between the peripheral leukocyte count or the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the intensity of the granulocyte uptake. Therefore CRP, but not the leukocyte count or ESR, appears useful for selecting the patients who benefit most from granulocyte scintigraphy.\r"

Eighteen healthy subjects and 13 patients with various chronic lung diseases were studied by this method. The principle of using an aerosol administration system similar to the system used for routine ventilation lung studies is stressed. Proximal large airway deposition of the radioaerosol was obtained by using relatively large particles (average diameter 2 microM) of [99mTc]MAA aerosol. Monitoring was performed by visual inspection of the tracheo-bronchial cinescintigraphic ascendence of the accumulated radioactive boli and by assessing their rate of clearance via automated computer analysis of the time-activity curves, following the movement of each bolus. The normal mean +/- s.d. clearance rate thus obtained was 4.7 +/- 1.3 mm/min. This rate appears to be more precise as compared with the range of results obtained by other radioisotopic methods. Significantly faster rates, mean 8.2 +/- 1.4 mm/min (p less than 0.001) were obtained in bronchiectatic patients while slower rates (2.8 mm/min) were seen in a patient with ciliary dyskinesia.\r"

In this method, scintigraphic data were acquired in a list mode with ECG R wave triggers and respiratory volume curve derived from respiratory flowmeter. Cardiac cycles occurring during the second halves of inspiratory and expiratory phases were separately selected and used to produce multigated images for the respective phases. Twelve patients with normal LV ejection fraction (EF) (greater than 50%) and right ventricular (RV) EF (greater than 40%) and without pulmonary diseases were studied. LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) decreased during inspiration in all subjects (by 11 +/- 5%), whereas LV end-systolic volume (ESV) was insignificantly changed. Accordingly, LVSV decreased during inspiration in all subjects (by 17 +/- 7%). LVEF decreased from 64 +/- 6% during expiration to 60 +/- 6% during inspiration (p less than 0.001). In contrast to the left ventricle, RVEDV and RVSV increased during inspiration by 13 +/- 11% and 22 +/- 18%, respectively. RVESV did not change significantly. RVEF increased from 48 +/- 6% during expiration to 52 +/- 5% during inspiration (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that inspiratory reduction of LVSV during spontaneous respiration is due to a decrease in LVEDV which may be derived from an increase in RVEDV during inspiration through the mechanism of ventricular interdependence.\r"

Nineteen of these patients were found to have reversed liver-spleen activity ratios (colloid shift). The incidence of this finding was surprising in view of the absence of any predisposing factors in these patients. Colloid shift was seen as early as 2 hr after trauma and was found to persist as long as 188 days after the traumatic event. The explanation for colloid shift in this group of patients is unknown, but the results suggest that it is secondary to reticuloendothelial system stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Lung uptake of N,N,N'-trimethyl-N'-[2-Hydroxy-3-methyl-5-iodobenzyl]-1,3- propanediamine (HIPDM) has been reported, but the mechanism of this process has not yet been established. Thus, single-pass [125I]HIPDM accumulation was studied in rat lungs perfused with a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 4.5% bovine albumin. Iodine-125 HIPDM lung accumulation was monitored by the percent of extraction per gram of lung tissue. Iodine-125 HIPDM lung uptake did not appear to occur by simple diffusion. As the time of perfusion was increased from 2 to 15 min, the rate of uptake of 2 microM [125I]HIPDM decreased by 40%. During a 2-min perfusion, 98.6% +/- 6.7 (n = 8) extraction was observed with 2 microM [125I]HIPDM, but only 38% +/- 2.0 (n = 3) was extracted when the [125I]HIPDM concentration was 1 mM. The addition of 1 mM chlorpromazine, propranolol or imipramine also decreased [125I]HIPDM lung uptake to 43.0% +/- 1.5, 51.4% +/- 2.2, and 49.8% +/- 0.8, respectively, (each n = 4 - 6, p less than 0.001). Cold (4 degrees C) had little effect on pulmonary accumulation (77.7% +/- 7.4, n = 5, p less than 0.01), and the addition of ouabain or the use of sodium-free medium had no effect. Thus, pulmonary [125I]HIPDM accumulation does not appear to occur by sodium-dependent active transport. Rather, its uptake appears to be similar to the uptake of other basic amines, such as propranolol and imipramine, which are known to bind by physico-chemical interactions to pulmonary endothelial cell membranes and reflect pulmonary vascular surface area.\r"

The digitized images can be converted from gray scale to pseudo-color and displayed on a high resolution color monitor. Software was developed to facilitate quantitative analysis of autoradiograms produced in single and multiple tracer studies. Because of the high output linearity and accuracy of the solid-state detectors, the system was found to digitize autoradiograms significantly more precisely and accurately than previously described autoradiographic analyzers.\r"

  ".W": "The radiolabeling of lymphocytes with 111In has resulted in detectable toxic changes in the cells. The mechanisms of toxicity for lymphocytes have been related to the label's radioactivity and to the chelator used to mediate the intracellular localization. These mechanisms were examined by assessing cellular function with mitogen-mediated blastogenesis after labeling lymphocytes with either the chelator (tropolone) alone, 111In complexed with tropolone, or cadmium (the decay product of 111In) complexed with tropolone. Successful lymphocyte labeling with 111In was shown to be dependent upon the concentration of the chelator (tropolone). Increasing concentrations of tropolone inhibited lymphocyte function to a variable degree. Further reduction in cellular function was detected after incorporation of a constant amount of 111In or 111In's decay product, cadmium. Lymphocyte function was decreased by these two labels in a parallel linear manner. This same toxic effect was seen after labeling with small constant amounts of tropolone and increasing quantities of 111In or cadmium. Thus, although both the required chelator and the radiobiologic exposure have a deleterious effect on the lymphocyte, significant lymphocyte toxicity appears to result from the metal-to-cell interaction as a result of the metal decay product (cadmium).\r"

Dietary linolenic acid influenced membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition and altered the effect of different dietary levels of linoleic acid on membrane composition. At low dietary intakes of linolenic acid, membrane fatty acids derived from linolenic acid increased as dietary intake of C18:2(9,12) increased. At high dietary linolenic acid levels membrane content of fatty acids derived from linolenic acid decreased as dietary intake of linoleic acid increased. Glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity decreased at high levels of both dietary linoleic acid and linolenic acid. These observations suggest that dietary balance between linoleic and linolenic acids has a role in plasma membrane composition and may control glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity.\r"

The intestinal absorption of cholesterol was measured by collecting the mesenteric lymph at hourly intervals for 8 h after infusing a dose of [14C]cholesterol in a lipid emulsion through an indwelling duodenal catheter. Data on the hourly lymphatic output of [14C]cholesterol showed that the absorption of [14C]cholesterol plateaued at 4 h postdosing in all groups. The rate of the appearance of [14C]cholesterol in the mesenteric lymph significantly decreased in ZD rats at 5 h and thereafter. The cumulative absorption of [14C]cholesterol by ZD rats for the 8-h period was 4.4 +/- 1.0% of the dose, compared with 11.8 +/- 1.1% by PF and 10.7 +/- 1.4% by CT rats. There were no differences in percent distribution of esterified [14C]cholesterol among the three groups. Also, no significant change in mucosal cholesterol esterase activity was observed due to zinc deficiency. The present data and previous findings taken together suggest that the primary mechanism responsible for the impaired absorption of cholesterol may be associated with defective formation of chylomicrons in the intestinal mucosa.\r"

HPO is used to prevent anal leakage of unabsorbed oil when SPE is fed at high dietary levels. Since HPO and SPE are not absorbed, rats fed SPE derive their energy from protein and carbohydrate in the diet. The tissue levels of pancreatic enzymes in rats consuming high levels of SPE in the diet resemble those of rats eating a low fat diet in which energy is derived from carbohydrate and protein. Plasma and HDL cholesterol levels were lowest in the group consuming high levels of SPE, an observation that is consistent with previous reports. These data indicate that the pancreas responds to SPE as a nonnutritive ingredient rather than a digestible dietary lipid.\r"

At the 7.00-g protein intake level the mean total body ammonia production rate was 47.1 mumol/kg per min, with total excretion and retention rates being 10.1 mumol/kg per min and 37.0 mumol/kg per min, respectively. In birds with 1.75 g protein intake the mean total body ammonia production rate was 27.9 mumol/kg per min, with total excretion and retention rates being 3.1 mumol/kg per min and 24.8 mumol/kg per min, respectively. These values were significantly different between the two dietary groups (P less than 0.05-0.01). Ammonia N produced at low and high levels of dietary protein intake, contributed 33% and 84% of urinary uric acid N and 27% and 58% of urinary total N, respectively. With the above protein intake levels, 88% of urinary ammonia N and 6-9% of urinary nitrogenous compounds other than ammonia and uric acid were donated by ammonia N produced in the body. It is concluded that ammonia N produced in the body is the main source of uric acid N, which entirely explains the increase in urinary total N caused by feeding a high protein diet.\r"

Radioactivity in the feces of rats fed casein, cooked beans and raw beans was roughly 2, 5 and 10 times greater, respectively, than in the feces of those fed the protein-free diet. Apparent protein digestibility showed a strong negative linear correlation (r = -0.9805, P less than or equal to 0.01) with radioactivity in the feces. Positive correlation (P less than or equal to 0.01) was demonstrated between radioactivity and either total carbon or total nitrogen in the feces of rats injected with [14C]glycine. Mean value for the radioactivity in the urine of rats fed the different diets did not differ significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05). Endogenous nitrogen excretion of rats on bean diets was estimated by the ratio of total endogenous N to marker N, based on the protein-free diet. The results indicated that rats fed bean-containing diets excreted significantly more endogenous nitrogen than those fed the casein diet, even though the casein diet had stimulated twice as much endogenous excretion than the protein-free diet. As a consequence, apparent digestibility and biological value of bean protein are generally underestimated, although the \"real\" biological value was not affected by the endogenous nitrogen excretion of the rat.\r"

Indirect evidence had suggested that creatine levels may be low in these animals, since their livers accumulate a competitive inhibitor of creatine biosynthesis (S-adenosylhomocysteine), and they develop muscle signs suggestive of abnormal creatine metabolism. In contrast, however, the concentration of creatine in both liver and skeletal muscle of pyridoxine-deficient rats was higher than in pair-fed control rats. Pair-fed control rats also had higher creatine levels in liver and skeletal muscle than ad libitum-fed control rats, whose feed intake was about double that of the pair-fed control rats. Thus, feed restriction also increased the tissue creatine levels, and this effect was augmented slightly by pyridoxine deficiency. These changes could not be explained by the results of in vitro measurement of the enzymes of creatine biosynthesis. The activity of guanidoacetate methyltransferase in liver did not differ significantly among the three groups of animals. Kidney arginine-glycine transamidinase activity was noticeably lower in the pyridoxine-deficient rats than in pair-fed control rats and lower in pair-fed control rats than in ad libitum-fed control rats. Since creatinine excretion did not differ significantly among the three animal groups, the results suggest that decreased turnover of creatine may occur during pyridoxine deficiency above and beyond that of an apparent feed restriction alone.\r"

Results of expt. 1 showed that hemicellulose, lignin and citrus pectin, but not arenaceous flour or polygalacturonic acid, depressed beta-carotene utilization by the chick, as measured by percentage of consumed beta-carotene stored in liver as vitamin A relative to the 0% fiber control. In expt. 2, effects of the methoxyl content of pectin were studied. High and medium methoxyl apple pectin, citrus pectin and polygalacturonic acid reduced storage of vitamin A in liver. Low methoxyl apple pectin had no significant effect on beta-carotene utilization. Thus, several purified forms of dietary fiber significantly reduced beta-carotene utilization by chicks when fed at the 7% supplementary level. Moreover, with pectin, there was an inverse relationship between methoxyl content of pectin and beta-carotene utilization.\r"

All subsequent cultured embryos had a normal appearance and protein content, CRL and head-to-CRL percentages comparable to controls, except one zinc embryo.

  ".W": "Thirty-six weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: SE rats received 4.0 ppm selenium as sodium selenite in drinking water containing 1% sucrose; 15MO rats received 15 ppm molybdenum as sodium molybdate in the drinking water; 45MO rats received 45 ppm molybdenum in their water; and CON rats received distilled-deionized water containing only 1% sucrose. The esophageal carcinogen methylbenzylnitrosamine (MBN) was administered intragastrically in 10% ethanol twice per week for 5 wk at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg. MBN dosing was followed by a 12-wk period for tumor promotion. After this, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, testes, tibia, muscle, brain and esophagus were excised. The esophagus was examined for MBN-induced lesions using dissecting and light microscopes and a portion was analyzed for Se. All other tissues were analyzed for Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn; some were also analyzed for Se and Mo. Most rats had precancerous lesions, and all rats had papillomas. There were no significant differences among the four treatment groups in the incidence and number per rat of precancerous lesions or gross papillomas. The SE group had significantly fewer carcinomas per rat than the other groups. The SE rats exhibited a number of significant differences in tissue trace element concentrations; in particular, they had higher Fe concentrations in heart, kidney and spleen than the other rats. The SE rats also had significantly greater urinary excretion of Mn and Fe, and excretion of the latter elements was significantly correlated with that of selenium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 48) were fed one of eight diets in a 2 X 2 X 2 factorial design for 24 d. Two levels of copper (deficient, 0.7 microgram/g, or adequate, 8.3 micrograms/g) and iron (deficient, 8.3 micrograms/g, or adequate, 50 micrograms/g), and two types of carbohydrate (sucrose or starch, 62% of the diet) were fed. Copper-deficient rats had significantly lower hematocrit, hemoglobin and tibia iron levels and depressed copper and iron absorption when fed sucrose instead of starch. The apparent absorption of copper, but not iron, was significantly lower when rats deficient in both copper and iron were fed sucrose rather than starch. Iron-deficient rats fed sucrose apparently absorbed significantly more iron than those fed starch; however, sucrose did not significantly improve hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. The metabolism of copper and iron by rats fed diets adequate in these nutrients was not affected by the type of dietary carbohydrate. These data indicate that the type of dietary carbohydrate alters both copper and iron metabolism, particularly in copper-deficient rats.\r"

Selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented diets were fed to rats for 10 wk, after which groups of 10 rats fed each diet were given weekly intravenous injections of adriamycin in saline at doses of 0, 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg body weight for 12 wk. All rats were killed at 24 wk. Even though the cardiac glutathione peroxidase activity in the selenium-deficient group was less than 1% of that of the selenium-supplemented group, the severity of the adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy was similar in both groups. However, the selenium-deficient rats were more sensitive to the growth-inhibiting effect of the higher dose of adriamycin than the selenium-supplemented rats. Moreover, the lower dose of adriamycin caused a mild nephropathy in 70% of the deficient rats but affected only 10% of the supplemented rats. Selenium status may have to be considered when adriamycin is used as a chemotherapeutic agent.\r"

Normal, sham-operated, pair-fed, and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) rats were fed a 6, 14 or 22% protein (casein) diet. Diets were otherwise isoenergetic and equivalent in sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate and calcium. Weight, length, urinary protein and creatinine clearances were measured up to 6 mo of age. Regardless of group (normal, sham or CRI), animals fed a 6% protein diet weighed less and were shorter than animals fed 14 or 22% protein diets. No difference in growth could be found between 14 and 22% protein intake. However, animals with CRI fed 22% protein diet had a shorter survival time than animals fed 14 or 6% protein diets. Six percent protein intake led to a lower growth rate over the first 10-12 wk of age than 14 or 22% protein intake. We conclude that 14% protein intake in rats with CRI maintains normal growth and improves survival over 22% protein intake. Rats with CRI fed a 6% protein diet have improved survival compared to rats fed a 22% protein diet but suffer growth retardation.\r"

On each study day, three or four naive littermate male pups were placed in individual respiration chambers submerged in a water bath and studied simultaneously over a range of ambient temperatures (24-35 degrees C). The purpose of the cold exposure was to elicit maximal oxygen consumption and to determine the ability of the rat to maintain body temperature during cold stress. Minimum rates of oxygen consumption were observed at 33-34 degrees C in both groups. As ambient temperature was reduced, VO2 increased and rectal temperature decreased. Regression analysis revealed a significantly reduced oxygen consumption in the preobese pups within the thermoneutral zone and during cold exposure. A defect in energy expenditure for heat production was evident in the preobese (fa/fa) pups as indicated by their attenuated cold-induced rate of oxygen consumption and decreased ability to maintain body temperature during cold stress relative to their lean (Fa/?) littermates. Their lower VO2 within the thermoneutral zone implies that the preobese (fa/fa) pups have a decreased metabolic rate even under conditions in which cold-induced thermogenic mechanisms are turned off.\r"

Six male and nine female rats were sacrificed initially. The remaining animals were randomly assigned, within sex, and fed to gain either 105 g (H) or 40 g (M) or lose 25 g (L) during a 21-d period. Nine rats each from the H and M groups and six from the L group were then sacrificed. The remaining rats from the H (27) and M (27) groups were fed to gain at the H, M or L rate and rats from the L (12) group were fed to gain at the H or M level during a second 21-d period. All rats were sacrificed at the end of the second period. Body composition and weights of internal organs were determined and relationships between energy intake and energy gain were evaluated. Results indicated that at the end of period 2, body composition at equal age and body weight was influenced by nutritional treatment. At equal body weight, body protein weights were lower (P less than 0.05) and body fat, liver and gut weights higher (P less than 0.05) for rats on higher planes of nutrition. Feed required for maintenance of rats during period 2 tended to be lower and efficiencies of gain tended to be higher for rats fed the low level than for those fed the high level during period 1. Rats fed the medium level during period 1 had similar maintenance requirements but higher efficiencies of gain during period 2 than rats fed the high level during period 1. These results suggest that previous nutrition influenced energy utilization through adaptation of high energy expending internal organs as well as through alterations in body composition and composition of body weight gain.\r"

The group practice, unlike the traditional clinic, emphasized primary care by providing 24-hour, seven day/week access by telephone; continuity between inpatient and ambulatory care (all patients admitted as private patients of group practice attending physicians) and coordination of care. Resource use, including visits to the primary care site, the emergency room and specialty clinics, and tests ordered at each site were tracked for one year by chart review. Multivariate analysis showed that, contrary to expectations, group practice patients had no fewer emergency room or specialty clinic visits, although they did make more visits to the practice. With respect to tests, practice patients had almost two more tests ordered in the primary care site than clinic patients, although there was no concomitant reduction in tests ordered at other sites. The authors conclude that ambulatory care resource use is an insufficient measure of the effect of a change in practice setting.\r"

The thickened and unthickened meals were followed by similar amounts of scintigraphically demonstrated gastroesophageal reflux. However, the number of episodes of emesis (1.2 +/- 0.7 vs 3.9 +/- 0.9 per 90 minutes postprandial), the percent of gastric emptying at 30 minutes (17.8% +/- 2.7% vs 22.4% +/- 2.4%), the time spent crying (11.7 +/- 3.1 minutes vs 17.6 +/- 3.8 minutes per 90 minutes), and the total time spent awake (45.2 +/- 5.9 minutes vs 53.1 +/- 4.9 minutes per 90 minutes) were significantly less after the thickened feedings. Because thickening of infant feedings increases the caloric density, decreases emesis, decreases crying time, and increases sleep time in the postprandial period, it is likely to be beneficial in the treatment of infants with gastroesophageal reflux associated with failure to thrive.\r"

All infants had a minimum of three feedings of both thickened and unthickened juice. The recordings of distal esophageal pH were analyzed for the percent of time the pH was less than 4 in the first 2 hours after each feeding. The infants were maintained in the following positions after feeding: prone (n = 29), prone-board with the head elevated 30 degrees from horizontal (n = 29), supine (n = 7), and unrestricted (n = 21). We found no significant difference in the percent of time with reflux with thickened versus unthickened feedings except in those infants maintained in the 30-degree prone position. In the first 2 hours after eating thickened juice, infants maintained in this position had increased esophageal reflux time (P less than 0.006). Further analysis revealed that 33% of the infants had a greater than 30% increase in esophageal reflux time after thickened feedings. Our study suggests that the immediate effect of thickened feedings on gastroesophageal reflux in infants is unpredictable.\r"

Group 1 included 74 children with chronic respiratory tract disorders and documented GER by prolonged esophageal pH monitoring, barium esophagram, and esophagoscopy; group 2 included 41 children with chronic respiratory tract disorders without GER. LLAM were present in 63 (85%) and eight (19%) children from groups 1 and 2, respectively (P less than 0.0001). Thus a strong association between the presence of LLAM and GER in children with chronic respiratory tract disorders was established. We suggest that LLAM from bronchial lavage may be a useful marker for tracheal aspiration in children with GER in whom chronic lung disease may subsequently develop.\r"

Study of patients with syndromic PILBD has enabled us to recognize five major features: peculiar facies (95%), chronic cholestasis (91%), posterior embryotoxon (88%), butterfly-like vertebral arch defects (87%), and peripheral pulmonary artery hypoplasia or stenosis, either isolated or associated with complex cardiovascular abnormalities (85%). By observing these major features, it is possible to differentiate the \"complete\" syndrome, in which all five features are present (26 cases), from the \"partial\" syndrome, in which only four (42 cases) or three (12 cases) major features are present. Other less frequent features were observed in patients with complete or partial syndrome: growth retardation (50%), mental retardation (16%), renal disturbances, other vascular malformations, bone abnormalities, high-pitched voice, and delayed puberty. Death occurred in 21 (26%) patients with syndromic PILBD. Therapy consisted of supplementation of medium-chain triglycerides and fat-soluble vitamins and administration of cholestyramine or phenobarbital. An autosomal dominant mode of transmission, with variable penetrance, seems likely.\r"

Bilirubin-protein conjugates were assayed using a new method that selectively removes bilirubin reversibly bound to protein, allowing measurement of the tightly bound bilirubin-protein conjugates by use of a diazo method. Fifty-two serum samples from children with varying bilirubin concentrations and diagnoses were studied. Whereas no conjugated pigment was detectable in the serum samples of healthy children or in individuals with Gilbert syndrome or Crigler-Najjar syndrome, bilirubin monoester and diester conjugates and bilirubin-protein conjugates were present in the sera of children with cholestatic liver disease, and accounted for 69% +/- 15% of the total bilirubin in these samples. Bilirubin fractional analysis was incapable of differentiating extrahepatic biliary obstruction from hepatocellular disease, because of overlap between the groups. The presence of bilirubin-protein conjugates in serum always coincided with detection of bilirubin monoester and diester conjugates. The distribution of bilirubin and its conjugates in sera provides a sensitive, although nonspecific, measure of hepatic disease.\r"

In selected cases, ERCP manometric study of the sphincter of Oddi, endoscopic sphincterotomy, or balloon extraction of common bile duct stones was performed. Nineteen patients had significant or abnormal structural findings, including pancreas divisum (four patients); sclerosing cholangitis (three); and choledochal cyst, chronic pancreatitis, choledochocele, pancreatic pseudocyst, common bile duct stone, and sphincter of Oddi motor dysfunction (two each). In all instances in which patients required operation, ERCP examination provided specific anatomic detail that was useful for planning appropriate intervention. The only significant complication after ERCP was mild pancreatitis, which occurred in four patients and responded to supportive, short-term measures.\r"

We have examined serum 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D concentrations in another group of children with hypercalciuria in whom urinary calcium excretion was excessive after an overnight fast. Eleven children with idiopathic fasting hypercalciuria (IH) (urinary calcium excretion greater than 4 mg/kg/24 hr and fasting urinary calcium/urinary creatinine ratio greater than 0.21) and seven healthy children were observed while they were eating a diet containing 1 gm calcium per day. Fasting serum 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D concentrations were elevated in children with IH compared with control values (35.3 +/- 3.2 vs 21 +/- 2 pg/ml, P = 0.003), whereas fasting serum parathyroid hormone, 25-OH vitamin D, phosphorus, and ionized calcium concentrations were similar in the two groups. These data suggest that disordered 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D metabolism occurs in children with fasting IH. Absorptive and fasting IH may represent a spectrum of a single disorder characterized by excessive urinary calcium excretion and inappropriately elevated serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D.\r"

Individuals with renal hypercalciuria (five children) had a high fasting urinary calcium/creatinine concentration ratio (0.27 +/- 0.05), a mild increase of this value after calcium administration (0.29 +/- 0.07, P less than 0.05), and elevated mean serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations (0.95 +/- 1.14 ng/ml). Patients with absorptive hypercalciuria (11 children) had fasting urinary calcium/creatinine concentration ratio of 0.11 +/- 0.04, a large increase of this index after calcium loading (0.25 +/- 0.06, P less than 0.0005), and normal levels of serum PTH (0.29 +/- 0.10 ng/ml). Next, we examined the effects of two different calcium intakes on urinary calcium excretion, serum calcium, PTH, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations. In patients with absorptive hypercalciuria, the increased calcium intake resulted in significant increments of calciuria (P less than 0.0005), mild elevation of serum calcium concentration (P less than 0.05), and reduction of serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 concentrations (P less than 0.005). By contrast, these values were not modified in children with renal hypercalciuria. Serum PTH did not change within each group. After dietary calcium supplementation, serum ratios of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to calcium, phosphate, and PTH concentrations decreased significantly only in the group of children with absorptive hypercalciuria. Our data support the contention that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 metabolism is different in the two groups of patients with hypercalciuria.\r"

The inhalation technique was first taught with conventionally, that is, verbal directions and demonstration with a canister nebulizer for 10 minutes. Only 10 (30%) of 33 children learned the technique. The remaining 23 were then taught with the special device. Twenty of 23 learned the technique within 10 minutes, but three others took longer. In a second study, 22 children, 11 of whom were beginners and 11 incorrect users, were instructed with the teaching device from the beginning. Seventeen (77%) learned the technique within 10 minutes; five others took longer. Most children can be taught the aerosol inhalation technique with this easily constructed device.\r"

Sensorineural deafness in one child and bilateral blindness in one remained stable over time, but of six children with spastic cerebral palsy at 2 years, only three retained this diagnosis at 5 1/2 years. The mean Mental Developmental Index (MDI) on the Bayley Scales at 2 years was 91.1, significantly below the test mean; by 5 1/2 years the mean full scale of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence (WPPSI) was 101.8. The MDI correlated highly with the full-scale WPPSI (r = 0.7), but for individual children it was not always an accurate predictor of 5-year ability. Between 2 and 5 1/2 years there was a substantial reordering within four categories of impairment: findings in 27 children were improved, four were judged to become more severely impaired over time, and 19 did not change. We conclude that our 2-year assessment often underrated the potential of the children as expressed at 5 1/2 years, and that 2 years is too early for reliable classification of children of birth weight 500 to 999 g.\r"

Term amniotic fluid enhanced platelet thromboxane B2 (TXB2) production in the presence of the aggregating agents thrombin and arachidonic acid, activity being confined to the lipid fraction. Compared with a baseline production of 1.4 +/- 0.45 pmol TXB2/10(6) platelets in response to thrombin (1 U/ml), unfractionated amniotic fluid or its lipid fraction enhanced TXB2 production to 2.87 +/- 0.53 and 2.81 +/- 0.62 pmol, respectively (P less than 0.01). Values for the aqueous extract were no different from buffer control values (1.14 +/- 0.5). No enhancement of platelet TXB2 production was observed in amniotic fluid obtained at 15 to 17 weeks. Similar activity was observed with either adult or neonatal platelets. This thromboxane enhancing property of amniotic fluid appears to be distinct from its thrombin generating property. Following perinatal aspiration, in situ production of thrombin and proaggregatory TXA2 could recruit more platelets, enhance local TXA2 production, and be responsible for the platelet thrombi that have been documented at autopsy in the pulmonary microcirculation in infants with perinatal aspiration syndrome.\r"

The dose was increased stepwise from 1 to 2, to 2 to 4, and 4 to 8 micrograms/kg/min. Plasma concentrations of catecholamines, including dopamine, were compared with blood pressure, heart rate, and Doppler cardiac output. The data were analyzed to determine the threshold or minimal plasma concentration of dopamine necessary to produce discernible effects. Plasma clearance rate was calculated from steady-state plasma concentrations. The average threshold for increases in mean arterial pressure was 50% below that for increases in heart rate. Improvements in arterial pressure were noted before and at lower thresholds than for increases in heart rate. Serial echocardiographic data showed dose-dependent increases in cardiac output and stroke volume without significant change in heart rate or systemic vascular resistance. Thresholds and plasma clearance values were similar in infants of gestational age 27 to 42 weeks and birth weights 900 to 4300 g. Administration of dopamine at initial dosages lower than commonly recommended, followed by incremental increase in dose, may be associated with improved left ventricular performance with avoidance of undesirable tachycardia and arrhythmias.\r"

Potentially toxic trough concentrations occurred in three of the first nine patients studied, in whom the dose and a 4-hour dosing interval were prescribed on the basis of one-compartment pharmacokinetic calculations (Sawchuck-Zaske method). In contrast, final concentrations were within the accepted target ranges for the remaining 13 patients with cystic fibrosis, in whom the dose and interval were adjusted empirically on the basis of a single pair of \"peak\" and trough values. The mean +/- SD final dosage required to achieve target concentrations was 13.8 +/- 2.9 mg/kg/d for children and 11.8 +/- 1.1 mg/kg/d for adults (P greater than 0.05), generally divided into four doses at 6-hour intervals. Mean half-life and incremental increase in serum concentration from previous trough to subsequent \"peak,\" an indirect measurement of volume of distribution, were not significantly different between children or adults with cystic fibrosis and pediatric control subjects; there was little interpatient variability in these values. Thus the high dosage requirements were related more to the higher target concentrations than to altered pharmacokinetic disposition in patients with cystic fibrosis. We conclude that the initial dose of gentamicin to achieve a peak of 8 to 12 micrograms/mL and a trough of less than 2.0 micrograms/mL in patients with cystic fibrosis should be 3 mg/kg administered every 6 hours in children and every eight hours in adults. Subsequent dosage adjustment should be made on the basis of a pair of peak and trough serum concentration measurements obtained after the fifth dose. Dosing intervals in this patient population generally should be no shorter than every 6 hours, even if the initial trough concentration is less than 1 microgram/mL.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of animals to O2 at increased partial pressures above 2.5 atmospheres absolute results in seizures. The endogenous intracellular antioxidant defense mechanisms are thought to play a protective role in mitigating such seizures. Investigations were carried out to determine if inhibiting brain glutathione reductase with carmustine would result in an alteration in time to seizures of rats exposed to high pressure O2. Treatment of air-breathing rats with carmustine (12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg i.v.) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease (P less than .001) in whole-brain glutathione reductase activity without affecting the activities of the other components of the antioxidant defense mechanisms determined. This treatment also resulted in a dose-dependent decrease (P less than .001) in time to seizure of rats exposed to four atmospheres absolute O2. Conversely, treatment of rats with lomustine (30 mg/kg i.v.), a nitrosourea compound related to carmustine, failed to affect the activity of brain glutathione reductase or any other component of the antioxidant defense mechanism determined, or did it influence the seizure time of rats exposed to four atmospheres absolute O2. These results suggest that glutathione reductase is an integral component of the antioxidant defense mechanisms. Inhibition of this enzyme results in an alteration in sensitivity of the organism to the toxic effects of O2.\r"

There was parallel inhibition of [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding, with the following inhibition constants: atropine = 2.38 nM, PZ = 426 nM and AF-DX 116 = 3660 nM. Using the same animals, these compounds inhibited [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding in homogenates from both cerebral cortex and heart. The order of potency was the same in the cerebral cortex as in the pancreas: atropine = 0.67 nM, PZ = 85 nM and AF-DX 116 = 440 nM.

In the heart, the order of potency was shifted to atropine greater than AF-DX 116 greater than PZ, with inhibition constants of 1.55, 12 and 110 nM, respectively. Thus, the muscarinic receptors in the pancreas and the heart exhibited the characteristics of the putative M2 receptor subtype, having lower affinities for PZ than the muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex.

  ".W": "In this study the causal relationship between alpha-1 adrenoceptor activation mediating contraction in rat aorta and the mediatory responses, such as phosphatidylinositol turnover and intracellular Ca++ release has been evaluated. Norepinephrine (1 X 10(-5) M) increased maximally the accumulation of [3H]inositol-1-PO4. In the presence of LiCl (10 mM) the norepinephrine-induced accumulation of [3H]inositol-1-PO4 occurred in a time-dependent, linear fashion (0-60 min), achieving a 13-fold increase over the unstimulated control at 60 min of exposure. This stimulation could be inhibited by prazosin (1 X 10(-7) M) but not by yohimbine (1 X 10(-7) M), whereas it was also unaffected by nifedipine (3 X 10(-7) M). Potassium depolarization did not invoke [3H]inositol-1-PO4 production nor did Sgd 101/75 in concentrations of up to 3 X 10(-5) M, although both have been found effective in stimulating a large influx of Ca++ for their contraction. However, the effect of norepinephrine on the formation of [3H] inositol-1-PO4 was antagonized by Sgd 101/75. A positive correlation (correlation coefficient 0.966) between intracellular Ca++ release and phosphatidylinositol turnover induced by a series of alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonists was demonstrated. These data support the hypothesis that stimulation of alpha-1 adrenoceptors in rat aorta can elicit two distinct processes of Ca++ utilization for contraction. One facilitates exclusively an influx of extracellular Ca++ which is independent of phosphatidylinositol turnover, whereas the other activates the release of intracellularly bound Ca++ that may be mediated primarily by phosphatidylinositol metabolism.\r"

However, concentrations of naloxazone up to 3 X 10(-4) M (120 min incubation-60 min washout) did not depress the maximal response or the slope of the concentration-response curve for BW 942C and, therefore, did not allow calculation of KA value. To analyze the residual activity of BW 942C, tissues were incubated with naloxone for 60 min after naloxazone treatment. Schild analysis of naloxone antagonism after 3 X 10(-6) M naloxazone produced a pKB of 8.0 +/- 0.06 and a slope of 0.88 +/- 0.03, suggesting simple competitive antagonism at a single site. In the absence of naloxazone treatment, naloxone 10(-8) to 10(-5) M antagonized the effects of BW 942C yielding a pKB value and slope of 8.34 +/- 0.08 and 1.0 +/- 0.04, respectively. Schild analysis of naloxone antagonism after 10(-4) M naloxazone yielded a pA2 of 6.23 +/- 0.20 and a slope of 0.55 +/- 0.08. These values were not consistent with simple competitive antagonism at a single receptor site. Modeled curves showed that the data for naloxone antagonism after 10(-4) M naloxazone were consistent with action at two receptor sites with naloxone pKB values of approximately 8.3 (experimentally determined) and approximately 6.0. An alternative explanation of altered affinity for BW 942C and naloxone at a single site produced by naloxazone treatment cannot be excluded.\r"

  ".W": "The objectives of the present studies were 1) to pharmacologically characterize the muscarinic autoreceptors in the striatum and 2) to examine their role in the regulation of physiologic acetylcholine (ACh) release. Schild plots were generated for atropine and pirenzepine against oxotremorine-induced inhibition of [3H]ACh release. Atropine, a nonselective antagonist, yielded a pA2 of 8.92. The pA2 for pirenzepine, a purported M1-selective antagonist, was 7.14. Both Schild plots had slopes not significantly different from one. Four agonists [oxotremorine, carbachol (CARB), McN-A-343 and pilocarpine] were tested for their effectiveness in inhibiting [3H]ACh release. McN-A-343 and pilocarpine have been reported to be selective for M1 receptors. Oxotremorine and carbachol were effective and potent inhibitors of [3H] ACh release, whereas McN-A-343 and pilocarpine were weak. Although the existence of muscarinic receptor subtypes remains an open question, these data are consistent with the \"low\" pirenzepine affinity (M2) subtype. Chronic treatments (14 days) with several agents were carried out (in vivo) to assess the role of muscarinic autoreceptors in the regulation of physiologic ACh release. Scatchard analyses of binding studies with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate were also performed to assess changes in the muscarinic receptor population in the striatum. Chronic treatment with scopolamine caused a 100% increase in the Bmax for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding but had no effect on the sensitivity of [3H]ACh release to inhibition by CARB. Fourteen-day treatment with physostigmine (3 mg/kg) produced a decrease in the sensitivity of [3H]ACh release to CARB plus a 42% decrease in Bmax and a 48% decrease in Kd for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding. Chronic haloperidol treatment caused an increase in the sensitivity of [3H]ACh release to CARB accompanied by a 46% increase in Bmax for 3H quinuclidinyl benzilate binding. These data suggest that muscarinic autoreceptors in the striatum do not regulate physiologic ACh release in the presence of intact acetylcholinesterase and that the interaction of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the striatum may not be simple trans-synaptic inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo metabolism in humans of the anticonvulsant mephenytoin exhibits stereoselectivity as well as genetic polymorphism of the 4-hydroxylation pathway. The characteristics of the involved cytochrome P-450 isozyme are, however, not known completely. Accordingly, the ability of human liver microsomes to metabolize mephenytoin and its enantiomers was investigated in vitro, and the ability of related anticonvulsants and other compounds to inhibit 4-hydroxylation was studied. Marked stereoselectivity was observed in the conversion of S-mephenytoin to its 4-hydroxy metabolite, but N-demethylation was essentially similar for both enantiomers. The intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km) for 4-hydroxymephenytoin formation showed an almost 10-fold range in five livers and was 150- to 1000-fold greater than that for N-demethylation. Competitive inhibition of 4-hydroxylation was observed with ethotoin, mephobarbital, methsuximide and phensuximide, but not other commonly used anticonvulsants such as ethosuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone. However, synthetic N-alkyl analogs of the latter compounds were found to be inhibitory. An aryl residue alpha to the carbonyl carbon of an N-alkyl lactam in a 5- or 6-membered ring, therefore, appears to be a minimal requirement for strong interaction with the 4-hydroxylase. Warfarin, but not diazepam, ketoconazole or iodochlorohydroxyquin, were also competitive inhibitors, but at much higher concentrations than the anticonvulsants. Competitive inhibition at concentrations similar to the Km of 4-hydroxymephenytoin formation (30-350 microM) may indicate that the isozyme is involved in the metabolism of the substrates under consideration and, therefore, their in vivo metabolism may be regulated to some extent by the same genetic factor(s) that determine mephenytoin's biotransformation.\r"

The responses to transmural stimulation and norepinephrine, relative to those caused by 30 mM K+, were greater in the infant beagle arteries than in those from the older beagles. Equipotent concentrations of the amine for producing the same magnitude of contraction as that evoked by 5 or 20 Hz stimulation in beagles of different ages did not differ. Treatment with 10(-9) M prazosin or 10(-8) M yohimbine attenuated the response to norepinephrine in 30-day and 12-year-old beagles to a similar extent. Contractions induced by transmural stimulation in the infant beagle arteries were potentiated slightly by 10(-9) M yohimbine and, in contrast, attenuated at 10(-8) M. On the other hand, the stimulation-evoked contraction in the senile beagle arteries was potentiated by these concentrations of yohimbine in a dose-dependent manner. Angiotensin II potentiated responses to electrical stimulation in 30-day and 12-year-old beagles to a similar extent. Contractions by angiotensin II and serotonin did not alter with age. It may be concluded that alpha adrenoceptor function reduces during an early postnatal period, but does not decline further through senescence. It appears that prejunctional, but not postjunctional, alpha-2 receptor function develops after birth, whereas pre- and postjunctional angiotensin receptors already mature in beagles until the age of 30 days.\r"

This desensitization is accompanied by two patterns of receptor changes: first, reduction of surface receptors (defined as binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol inhibited by 1 microM CGP 12177 [4-3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazole- 2-on-hydrochloride]) without any change in the total number of [3H] dihydroalprenolol binding sites inhibited by 1 microM propranolol (receptor redistribution); then reduction of the total number of receptors (receptor down-regulation). In the present study we investigated receptor redistribution and down-regulation under physiological conditions by raising endogenous catecholamines in the rat by stress. In young rats a single immobilization stress induced MNL beta adrenergic receptor redistribution: the number of surface receptors was reduced by about 50% but the total number remained the same. Receptor redistribution was prevented completely in rats pretreated with beta-blocking nadolol. Repeated stress down-regulated the MNL beta adrenergic receptors as shown by a reduction in the total number of sites. We also investigated the regulation of beta adrenergic receptors in three age-groups. After 60 min of immobilization stress the number of MNL surface receptors was reduced in young (4-month-old) rats but not in mature (12-month-old) or aged (26-month-old) rats. Using an alternative stress procedure, after single or repeated open-field sessions, we found receptor redistribution and down-regulation, respectively, in young rats. None of these adaptive receptor response was observed in 26-month-old rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, there was much closer agreement between the Ki and D50-GTP of the less efficacious oxotremorine analog BM5 [N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-4-pyrrolidino-2-butynyl)acetamide]. By comparing equal levels of adenylate cyclase inhibition before and after partial inactivation of muscarinic receptors with benzilycholine mustard, it was possible to estimate the dissociation constants (KA) of the oxotremorine analogs.

  ".W": "The direct effects of etomidate, ketoconazole, miconazole and metyrapone were investigated on the secretion of cortisol and its precursors by dispersed cells from the adrenal cortex of a normal individual and four patients with Cushing's syndrome. The drugs interfered with adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulated cortisol secretion in a dose-dependent way. Desoxycortisol concentrations in the medium were increased after the addition of metyrapone and low doses of etomidate but were suppressed with higher doses of etomidate. The production of 17-hydroxy-progesterone was stimulated by miconazole and metyrapone but was strongly suppressed by the high doses of etomidate. Ketoconazole caused a stimulation of progesterone release, whereas the release of 17-hydroxyprogesterone was suppressed. Finally, the concentration of progesterone was strongly enhanced with high doses of miconazole, whereas etomidate suppressed progesterone production. It is concluded that etomidate at a low concentration (IC50, 10(-8) M) inhibits 11 beta-hydroxylase, whereas, at higher concentrations (10(-7)-10(-6) M), the side-chain cleavage enzyme system is also inhibited; metyrapone is a weaker (IC50, 10(-7) M) but pure 11 beta-hydroxylase inhibitor; miconazole inhibits adrenal 21-hydroxylase at 10(-6) M; and ketoconazole inhibits 17-hydroxylase. Etomidate, ketoconazole, miconazole and metyrapone inhibit cortisol biosynthesis in the human adrenal gland in different manners, which appear to involve the four cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase reactions. Interestingly, these drugs affect corticosteroidogenesis by normal, hyperplastic and adenomatous adrenal cells in a similar manner.\r"

  ".W": "The hepatotoxicity and metabolism of the following close analogs of the hepatotoxic antitumor agent N-methylformamide (NMF) were investigated in CBA/CA mice: N-ethylformamide (NEF), dimethylformamide (DMF), formamide and N-methylacetamide (NMA). Apart from NMF only NEF was potently hepatotoxic as measured by the elevation of plasma activities of the enzymes sorbitol dehydrogenase and alanine and aspartate aminotransferases 24 hr after drug administration. In freeze-dried urine samples of mice which had received NEF or NMF, but not in the case of DMF, formamide or NMA, thioesters were detected by thin-layer chromatography. Evidence based on high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis and 400 MHz 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry suggests that the thioester metabolite of NEF is S-(N-ethylcarbamoyl)-N-acetylcysteine. It has been shown previously that NMF is metabolized to S-(N-methylcarbamoyl)-N-acetylcysteine. NEF also underwent extensive metabolism to ethylamine; similarly NMF was biotransformed to methylamine. In contrast, the urine of mice which had received DMF contained only very small amounts of dimethylamine and methylamine could not be detected as a metabolite of NMA. Instead, the major metabolite of NMA was identified by 400 MHz 1H-NMR spectrometry as N-(hydroxymethyl)acetamide. DMF is known to undergo extensive metabolism to its N-hydroxymethyl derivative. The results suggest that two metabolic pathways of N-alkylformamides can be distinguished: Hydroxylation at the alpha-carbon of the N-alkyl group and oxidation of the formyl moiety. The former pathway presumably constitutes a detoxification route, and the latter may well be associated with hepatotoxicity, and affords a glutathione conjugate, excreted in the urine as a mercapturate.\r"

  ".W": "The aminopyrine breath test is a valuable quantitative liver function test. However, it may be influenced by factors not related primarily to liver disease. For instance, it has been published that diabetes affects microsomal demethylation of aminopyrine in vitro. The relevance of these findings for the in vivo situation, however, is ill defined. Aminopyrine disposition was evaluated, therefore, by performing an in vivo-in vitro comparison of its kinetics in control, diabetic and insulin-treated diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (75 mg/kg i.v.). A tracer dose of [14C]aminopyrine was injected i.p. (40 mu Ci/kg, 0.7 mg/kg) and the kinetics of 14CO2 in breath as well as disappearance of aminopyrine in blood were followed simultaneously for 2 hr. Diabetes increased the 14CO2 elimination rate constant in breath by 90%, whereas total recovery of 14CO2 in breath was decreased by 30% (P less than .001). Aminopyrine clearance in blood was doubled in diabetic rats compared to control (48.9 +/- 11.3 vs. 21.4 +/- 3.3 ml/min X kg, P less than .001). This was due to an increased volume of distribution (1.99 +/- 0.31 in diabetic rats vs. 0.96 +/- 0.11 liters/kg in control). In vitro aminopyrine kinetics in hepatic microsomal preparations showed a 52% higher Vmax of aminopyrine demethylase in D (P less than .001), whereas Km remained unchanged. The diabetes-induced changes were reversible by insulin. It is concluded that diabetes alters the aminopyrine breath test by interfering with demethylation rate and distribution of aminopyrine, and by changing the fate of the cleaved C1-fragments.\r"

  ".W": "According to previous reports, the effect of verapamil on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) responses in the rabbit aorta is likely to represent a resultant of 5-HT2-receptor antagonism and Ca++-channel blockade. In practice, verapamil produced rightward displacement and depression of 5-HT-concentration-effect curves in this tissue. Under these conditions, verapamil's competitive property may not be justifiably quantified by analyzing curve displacements. In order to detect and quantify this property, a recently developed concentration-ratios method was applied. This method depends on the effect of the test substance, verapamil here, on the expression of competition by a standard antagonist, spiperone in this study. Analysis of the concentration-ratios produced by spiperone in the presence of verapamil permitted receptor competition by verapamil to be detected. Quantification of this property indicated a pKB of 5.73. This estimate of affinity did not account for the total rightward displacement of 5-HT-concentration-effect curves that verapamil produced, indicating, presumably, that concomitant Ca++-antagonism contributed to these displacements. Also, this estimate of verapamil's 5-HT2-receptor affinity is lower than that derived elsewhere from an analysis of the overall antagonistic effect of verapamil on 5-HT responses in the rabbit aorta. These results illustrate the potentially general utility of the concentration-ratios methods in elucidating resultant pharmacological actions.\r"

In contrast, in sham-operated dogs, the maximal pressor response due to deafferentation was of greater magnitude (63 +/- 6 mm Hg, n = 8) and of much longer duration (44 +/- 4 mm Hg, 60 min after deafferentation). Heart rate was only augmented slightly in both preparations. A marked elevation of epinephrine plasma concentration occurred 5 min after deafferentation and the magnitude of this effect was 8 times greater in dogs with innervated than denervated adrenal glands. Norepinephrine plasma concentration increased moderately and similarly in the two preparations. Administration of pergolide (30.0 micrograms/kg i.v.) 15 min before undertaking the deafferentation procedure induced a small, short-lasting increase in blood pressure and a small fall in heart rate in dogs in which the innervation to the adrenal glands was left either intact (sham-operated) or removed surgically. In dogs with adrenal gland denervated, pergolide blocked entirely the pressor response and the small elevation in plasma concentration of catecholamines evoked by sinoaortic deafferentation in the matched, saline-pretreated group. However, in sham-operated dogs (intact adrenal innervation), pergolide reduced partially (by 41%) the increase in blood pressure and plasma epinephrine concentration caused by deafferentation. The decrease in heart rate, produced by pergolide, was abolished by deafferentation in sham-operated and adrenal decentralized dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Exogenous GABA added to the superfusion medium caused a long-lasting and concentration-dependent enhancement of the basal efflux of [3H]ACh. The effect of GABA was not antagonized by bicuculline or picrotoxin. Muscimol increased slightly but not significantly the release of [3H]ACh, whereas (+/-)-baclofen or (-)-baclofen were ineffective. The effect of GABA was counteracted by SK&F 89976A [N-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-nipecotic acid], SK&F 100330A [N-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-guvacine] and SK&F 100561 [N-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-homo-beta-proline], three novel inhibitors of GABA uptake, but was unaffected by hemicholinium-3 or by beta-alanine. Nipecotic acid, a substrate-inhibitor of the GABA transporter, mimicked GABA and enhanced [3H]ACh release. The results indicate that a GABA transport system is present on cholinergic terminals.\r"

Livers were perfused at a constant pressure. [14C]Taurocholate was infused continuously at a rate of 0.6 mumol/min. Then, three increasing doses of norepinephrine were added to the perfusate. Norepinephrine induced a significant dose-dependent reduction in portal blood flow. In spite of this reduction, taurocholate extraction did not increase and intrinsic clearance decreased significantly. When portal blood flow was decreased mechanically, intrinsic clearance was, as expected, flow-independent. The effects of norepinephrine on portal blood flow and intrinsic clearance were antagonised by phentolamine but not by propanolol. Norepinephrine decreases independently both portal blood flow and the vectorial transport of taurocholate. These effects are mediated by alpha adrenergic receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms involved in the transport of tetraethylammonium (TEA) in the rabbit renal brush border were investigated by using membrane vesicles. Transport of [14C]TEA (0.2 mM) was measured by a rapid filtration method. We have reported previously that an imposed pH gradient (pHi = 6, pHo = 7.4) stimulates the uptake of TEA markedly, yielding a transient overshoot of 200% above the equilibrium value. Here we demonstrate that an overshoot of similar magnitude can also be obtained in the presence of indirectly induced proton gradients, via the naturally occurring Na+/H+ exchanger or via the artificial K+/H+ exchanger nigericin. The TEA exchange mechanism is shown to be electroneutral, temperature-dependent and saturable [Km, 0.328 (CL for P less than .05: 0.250-0.425) mM; Vmax, 2.13 (CL for P less than .05: 1.98-2.32) nmole/mg of protein X 15 sec]. Other organic cations interact with this exchange mechanism: mepiperphenidol and morphine both cis-inhibited and trans-stimulated TEA uptake. Quinine, which was the most potent inhibitor of TEA uptake (57% inhibition at 10(-5) M), did not trans-stimulate. The mechanism appears to be specific for organic cations inasmuch as the organic anion p-aminohippurate did not cis-inhibit or trans-stimulate TEA uptake. These results demonstrate the presence of a H+/TEA exchange mechanism in the rabbit renal brush border membrane showing many similarities with that shown to be present in the rat.\r"

Activities of two brush border enzymes, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT), and a lysosomal enzyme, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), were measured in 24-hr urine collections. Urinary excretion of all three enzymes was increased significantly after Cd-MT injection. Both ALP and GGT excretions reached a maximum at 24 hr whereas NAG excretion reached peak values at 48 hr after Cd-MT injection. The excretion of all three enzymes decreased to the control level by the 3rd day. Zn pretreatment alone had no effect on urinary enzyme excretion. Pretreatment with Zn salts at 0.5 and 2 hr before Cd-MT injection did not show any difference in the urinary excretion of the enzymes as compared with the saline-treated controls. However, injection of Zn salts at 24 hr before Cd-MT injection resulted in a significant decrease in the excretion of the lysosomal enzyme NAG whereas both ALP and GGT excretions were unchanged. Extensive proximal tubular damage was observed morphologically in all the rats injected with Cd-MT, but the cellular damage was less in rats pretreated with Zn sulfate 24 hr before Cd-MT injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The rats were prepared chronically with electrodes implanted on the stomach, duodeno-jejunum and colon and two small polyethylene catheters were inserted into the lateral ventricles of the brain. They were rendered physically dependent on morphine by the s.c. administration of a slow-release emulsion containing morphine (75 mg over 48 hr). Morphine treatment was associated with an immediate (15-30 min) inhibition of gastric and colonic spiking activity and intestinal migrating myoelectric complex lasting 6 to 8 hr, followed by a partial recovery of gastric spiking activity while a permanent disorganized motility pattern persisted on the intestine. After 48 hr of morphine treatment the i.c.v. and s.c. administrations of naloxone at doses of 0.03 and 3 mg X kg-1, respectively, promoted typical electrical activity lasting 2 to 3 hr, characterized by the presence of five to seven grouped spike bursts and termed \"minute rhythm.\" Previous central but not peripheral administration of either tolazoline or phentolamine at a dose of 0.3 mg X kg-1 inhibited the i.c.v. naloxone precipitated withdrawal.

  ".U": "87112164\r", 
  ".W": "In an attempt to evaluate the possible functional role of alpha-2 adrenoceptors located on noradrenergic nerve endings in the regulation of cerebral norepinephrine metabolism, we have measured the effects of clonidine and idazoxan on cerebral free 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (DOPEG) levels (an index of norepinephrine turnover) in the rat after surgical and experimental manipulations that allow an exclusive interaction of the alpha-2 adrenergic agents with presynaptic alpha-2 autoreceptors. The possible contribution of distant (to cell bodies) transsynaptic feedback mechanisms triggered by stimulation of postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors and of somatodendritic alpha-2 autoreceptor-mediated regulatory mechanisms was eliminated by a local infusion of tetrodotoxin (50 ng) into the ascending noradrenergic bundle followed by electrical stimulation (at a frequency of 8 Hz) of this pathway distally to the neurotoxin injection site in chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats. Under these conditions, systemic injection of idazoxan (20 mg/kg i.p.) and clonidine (0.3 mg/kg i.p.) provoked an increase and a decrease, respectively, in free DOPEG levels in the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex and medial septum which were similar to those measured in naive rats. Moreover, in these animals the effect of idazoxan (1 mg/kg i.p.) was surmounted by a large dose of clonidine (0.3 mg/kg i.p.). The possible contribution of feedback mechanisms triggered by activation of postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors and mediated via local (to terminals) circuits (or a putative humoral agent released postsynaptically) was eliminated subsequently by a local injection of ibotenic acid in noradrenergic projection areas. Systemic administration of idazoxan (20 mg/kg i.p.) to ibotenate-lesioned rats elicited an increase in septal- and hypothalamic-free DOPEG levels comparable to that found in sham-operated rats. The effectiveness of the lesion was attested by a massive neuronal depopulation in the lesioned areas. Finally, ibotenic acid-induced destruction of noradrenergic target cells and local infusion of tetrodotoxin into followed by electrical stimulation of the ascending noradrenergic pathways were combined. Under these conditions, idazoxan still increased hypothalamic- and septal-free DOPEG levels, the extent of this alteration being similar to that found in normal rats. Altogether, these results suggest that irrespective of their low density, presynaptic alpha-2 autoreceptors play a cardinal role in the regulation of central nervous system norepinephrine metabolism.\r"

The responses of single identified noradrenergic LC neurons to the systemic (i.v.) administration of cocaine were observed over a wide range of doses (0.0625-2.0 mg/kg). The spontaneous activity of all LC neurons receiving doses greater than the threshold dose (0.0625 mg/kg) was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The local anesthetics, procaine and mepivacaine, did not affect LC neuronal activity, action potential amplitude or slope. The inhibitory effects of cocaine on spontaneous LC neuron activity was reversed by the subsequent i.v. administration of the specific alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, piperoxone, but not the opiate receptor antagonist, naloxone. Pretreatment with another alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (5 mg/kg i.p.), attenuated significantly the inhibition of spontaneous LC activity elicited by i.v. cocaine. Intravenous cocaine produced a brief increase in mean arterial pressure which did not appear to be correlated with the more sustained inhibition of LC neurons. Reserpine pretreatment (10 mg/kg i.p.) attenuated significantly the inhibitory effects of cocaine on LC activity. These results suggest that the inhibition of spontaneous LC neuron activity by i.v. cocaine is most likely mediated by an augmented action of catecholamines at central alpha-2 adrenoceptors and not by the local anesthetic effects of cocaine.\r"

  ".W": "The role of cholinergic mechanisms in opioid-induced respiratory depression was investigated in isoflurane-anesthetized rats. In these animals, the i.v. administration of fentanyl, a clinically useful potent opioid analgesic/anesthetic, induced a prolonged period of apnea and subsequent rise in the end-tidal CO2, hypotension and bradycardia. The centrally acting anticholinesterase, physostigmine, significantly decreased fentanyl-induced respiratory and circulatory depression. The beneficial respiratory and circulatory effects of physostigmine could be abolished by the administration of muscarinic antagonists, e.g., scopolamine hydrobromide or atropine sulfate. Inhibition of inspiratory phrenic nerve activity by fentanyl and restoration of this activity by the subsequent i.v. administration of physostigmine indicates that the origin of this opioid-cholinergic interaction is the central nervous system. Similar effects on phrenic nerve discharge were observed when the systemic administration of fentanyl was followed by microinjection of physostigmine or carbachol in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. In conclusion, opioid-induced respiratory depression after systemic administration is obtunded greatly by facilitation of muscarinic mechanisms in the ventrolateral medulla. Inhibition of a cholinergic link in the central chemosensor may underlie opioid-induced respiratory depression. Manipulation of this cholinergic link could lead to the use and development of analgesics devoid of respiratory depression.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of estrogen to increase the alpha-1 adrenergic sensitivity of rabbit uterine smooth muscle was compared with its effects on the concentration of alpha adrenoceptor subtypes in myometrium. Compared to ovariectomized controls, estrogen treatment was found to increase the adrenergic contractile sensitivity of rabbit uterus determined in vitro. Estrogen treatment increased uterine alpha-2 adrenoceptor concentration nearly 5-fold. Mature rabbits (endogenous estrogen) had the same uterine sensitivity and alpha-2 adrenoceptor concentration as estrogen-treated rabbits. Alpha-1 receptor concentration was increased only in the estrogen-treated group, and was accompanied by increased maximal contractile response. Thus, the increase in adrenergic sensitivity after estrogen was correlated closely with an increased concentration of alpha-2 adrenoceptors. However, enhanced adrenergic sensitivity persisted after alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptor concentration returned to pre-estrogen levels in rabbits pretreated with estrogen before ovariectomy. Studies utilizing subtype-selective competitive antagonists verified that contractile response is mediated primarily by alpha-1 adrenoceptors, with no apparent influence of alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Finally, we found that adrenergic sensitivity is altered by temperature and divalent cation concentration, but these effects do not prevent the expression of the regulatory action of estradiol. We conclude that estrogen increases the alpha-1 adrenergic sensitivity of rabbit uterus without changes in alpha-1 receptors, and thus may act on postreceptor response events.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For both radioligands, high affinity binding with pharmacologic specificity was demonstrated. The high affinity Kd for [3H]PZ binding determined from saturation isotherms was 4.5 nM and the Kd for (-)-[3H]QNB binding was 6.2 pM. Comparison of the total binding capacity values determined by saturation experiments with [3H] PZ and (-)-[3H]QNB demonstrates that approximately 78% of the total muscarinic binding sites in rabbit peripheral lung bind [3H]PZ with high affinity. There was no significant effect of the guanine nucleotide, guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, on the inhibition of (-)-[3H]QNB binding by the muscarinic agonist carbachol in peripheral lung membranes. If the pulmonary muscarinic receptor with high affinity for PZ proves to have an important role in bronchoconstriction, its characterization could result in the development of more selective bronchodilators.\r"

  ".W": "We examined whether daily d-amphetamine administration affected behavior under the control of external stimuli differently than behavior not under such control. Two variants of a fixed-consecutive-number reinforcement schedule were combined in a multiple schedule. An external discriminative stimulus indicated when the schedule requirement for reinforcement had been satisfied in one component, no such stimulus was used in the other component. Reinforcement frequency was roughly equated between the components by reducing the probability of reinforcement in the added stimulus component. Two groups of animals were given daily i.p. injections with equivalent doses of drug. Tolerance to the drug's behavioral effects developed when injections occurred before behavioral evaluation but did so only to a limited extent when injections were given only after the sessions. This indicated that behaving in the presence of the drug facilitated the development of such tolerance. It developed under both stimulus control conditions at both doses; at 3.0 mg/kg, it developed predominantly in those aspects of behavior that were under the control of external discriminative stimuli. Although drug-related decreases in reinforcement frequency in some animals were correlated with behavioral tolerance development, differential tolerance development was not associated consistently with such reductions. Establishing discriminative control of behavior by external stimuli can both reduce sensitivity to repeated d-amphetamine administration and facilitate the development of tolerance to its behavioral effects.\r"

One component of the multiple schedule was a repeated-acquisition task in which the discriminative stimuli for left- and right-key responses changed each session (learning). In the other component, the discriminative stimuli were the same each session (performance). The mixed agonist-antagonists dezocine, GPA 1657 and nalbuphine each produced dose-related decreases in the overall rate of responding in each component of the multiple schedule. In general each drug produced greater rate-decreasing effects in the learning than in the performance component, although this differential effect between components was less apparent with dezocine. In the learning component low doses of nalbuphine and GPA 1657 produced small increases in percentage of errors but had little or no effect on response rate. A similar effect was obtained with dezocine in only one of four subjects tested. At doses which produced comparable rate-decreasing effects dezocine also exerted the least disruptive effect on the within-session pattern of acquisition. High doses of each drug disrupted accuracy in each component of the multiple schedule. In contrast to the other drugs tested, buprenorphine had virtually no effect on response rate or percentage of errors in either component of the multiple schedule across a wide range of doses (0.01-3.2 mg/kg). The results suggest that, among the mixed agonist-antagonist, buprenorphine is unique in that it does not disrupt the acquisition or performance of complex discrimination in patas monkeys.\r"

The drug bound in a positive cooperative manner to two classes of binding sites on phosphatidylcholine small unilamellar vesicles, one having an apparent high affinity and low capacity and another having a low affinity and high capacity. The observed data were shown to fit to a mixed type of inhibition when the free DH concentration (determined independently in the binding experiments) was used instead of the total drug concentration. Hydrolysis of enzyme-substrate-drug complexes was estimated to occur at a rate only half that of the enzyme-substrate complex. Results with DH suggest that both drug-enzyme and drug-substrate interactions may be important factors in the inhibition of lysosomal phospholipase A1.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed on several superficial veins from the rabbit face to examine the relationship between beta adrenoceptor subtype distribution, intrinsic myogenic tone and sympathetic nerve innervation. Experiments using selective beta adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists indicate that the dorsal nasal and angularis oculi veins possess a homogeneous population of beta-2 adrenoceptors. Sympathetic nerve stimulation in these segments results only in contraction mediated through postjunctional alpha adrenoceptors. These segments are devoid of intrinsic myogenic tone. In the facial vein, of which both veins are tributaries, both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors are found. Studies with the beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, betaxolol, and beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118,551, indicate that the prominent relaxation observed in this tissue to sympathetic nerve stimulation is mediated through postjunctional beta-1 adrenoceptors. At physiological temperatures, the facial vein possesses a marked intrinsic myogenic tone that is inhibited by this beta-1 adrenoceptor-mediated sympathetic activity. Considering the anatomical relationship between these vessels and the unique association between beta adrenoceptor subtype, intrinsic myogenic tone and sympathetic innervation, it is possible that facial blood redistribution in the rabbit can be markedly affected by sympathetic nerve stimulation. Such a process could have an important role in cranial thermoregulation.\r"

Key pecking was maintained by a schedule of reinforcement in which every 30th injection-appropriate response was reinforced by the presentation of food. Subjects were first trained to discriminate buspirone (1.0 mg/kg) from saline, and then generalization tests were conducted using a cumulative dosing procedure. Cumulative doses of buspirone (1.0-3.0 mg/kg), the buspirone analog MJ 13805 (1.0 mg/kg) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A ligand 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (0.3-1.0 mg/kg) produced in excess of 90% buspirone-appropriate responding, whereas midazolam (0.03-1.0 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.03-1.7 mg/kg), apomorphine (0.03-1.0 mg/kg), clozapine (0.1-3.0 mg/kg), methysergide (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine-1B ligand 1-[3-chlorophenyl]piperazine (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) produced little or no buspirone-appropriate responding up to those doses that markedly decreased response rate. These findings support recent behavioral and receptor binding studies suggesting that serotonin receptors, and 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A receptors in particular, may be responsible for mediating the anticonflict effects of buspirone and other atypical anxiolytics. The results also corroborate other behavioral work showing that the anxiolytic effects of buspirone are most likely not mediated by the dopaminergic system.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacological effects of N-[4-(2-bromoethylmethylamino)-2-butynyl]-2-pyrrolidone (BR 401) were compared in the mouse with those of N-[4-(2-chloroethylmethylamino)-2-butynl]-2-pyrrolidone (BM 123) and oxotremorine. BR 401 was more toxic than oxotremorine and BM 123 when administered i.v. (LD50, 0.7 mumol kg-1), but less toxic than oxotremorine when given i.p. (LD50, 39 mumol kg-1). Atropine and methylatropine (10 mumol kg-1 i.p.) increased the LD50 value of BR 401, given i.v., 75- to 100-fold. Upon i.v. administration, BR 401 was 2- to 3-fold more potent than oxotremorine and 10 to 20 times more potent than BM 123 in producing central (tremor and analgesia) and peripheral (salivation) muscarinic effects. However, after i.p. administration BR 401 was 3-fold less potent than oxotremorine in eliciting tremor and analgesia. The aziridinium ion (BR 401A), formed by cyclization of BR 401, produced salivation but no tremor. These observations suggest that BR 401 when given i.v. penetrates effectively into the central nervous system where it cyclizes rapidly to the pharmacologically active aziridinium ion. In contrast, after i.p. administration a large proportion of BR 401 will cyclize before it can reach the central nervous system. BM 123, because of its slower cyclization, enters the central nervous system effectively also by the i.p. route. Thus, central potency of 2-haloethylamines such as BR 401 and BM 123 is critically dependent not only on the rate of cyclization, but also on the route of administration. The duration of tremor induced by BR 401 and BM 123 was considerably shorter than that induced by oxotremorine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Proximal and distal rat small intestine was cut into strips measuring 6.0 X 10.0 mm. Strips cut along the oral-caudal axis were called longitudinal strips, whereas those cut 90 degrees to that axis were called circular strips. The strips were stretched to their optimal lengths and subjected to electrical field stimulation (0.1-1.0 msec pulse duration, 30-300 mA, 2-26 Hz) in the presence of Krebs' solution and Krebs' plus atropine, 10(-6) M. Field stimulation produced contraction responses that were inhibited by atropine and relaxation responses that were augmented by atropine. Muscarinic blockade abolished completely contraction in circular muscle, but atropine-resistant contractions persisted in the longitudinal strips. Proximal muscle showed significantly greater relaxation responses compared to distal muscle (P less than .05) at nearly all parameters of pulse duration, current and frequency. Contraction and relaxation amplitudes were significantly greater in longitudinal than respective circular muscle (P less than .05) at either site in the intestine. Thus, not only do the two muscle layers differ in their respective nerve supplies, but inhibitory neuromuscular transmission appears to have a greater influence in proximal than distal intestine.\r"

Naloxone (1 mg/kg i.p.) significantly antagonized the effect of p.o. levomethorphan (50 mg/kg). Levomethorphan (10 and 50 mg/kg p.o. and 1 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) significantly inhibited intestinal transit. Dextromethorphan significantly inhibited intestinal transit after p.o. (10, 50, 100, 200 mg/kg) and i.p. (50 mg/kg) administration. As in the case of gastric emptying, naloxone inhibited the effect of levomethorphan but did not alter the effect of dextromethorphan. Naloxone itself (1 mg/kg i.p.) did not affect gastric emptying or intestinal transit. The results suggest that levomethorphan exerts inhibitory effects on intestinal transit and gastric emptying that are probably mediated partly through an opiate mechanism whereas the effects of dextromethorphan may be mediated through a nonopiate mechanism of action.\r"

TEA and NMN excretion were inhibited by the following organic cations in order of decreasing potency: quinine, TEA and NMN. The respective competitive potency of these substances was related inversely to their maximum tubular transport rates (Tm). Regardless of inhibitor used (quinine, TEA or NMN), NMN excretion was always inhibited more easily than TEA excretion. In addition, TEA excretion was suppressed more easily than cimetidine excretion by the competitive inhibitor quinine. The Tm of cimetidine was determined to be less than the Tm of TEA, which in turn is less than that of NMN. These results indicate that the Tm of an organic cation is related inversely to its inhibitory potency and related directly to its susceptibility to inhibition, reflecting different affinities of organic cations for the same carrier-mediated transport system.\r"

Desensitization required stimulation of the receptor and was more marked against agonists of low intrinsic efficacy. The process was non-specific in that the responses to histamine were also affected. Application of null methods of analysis to pre- and postdesensitization concentration-response curves enabled an affinity constant to be derived. The values were consistently higher than those estimated using the irreversible antagonist, phenoxybenzamine. In contrast application of null methods to concentration-response curves in normal and low calcium concentrations enabled an affinity constant for pilocarpine to be calculated, which was very similar to that obtained using the irreversible antagonist. It is concluded that desensitization cannot be used to determine agonist affinity constants inasmuch as it results in overestimations.\r"

Pulmonary extraction of [3H]bupivacaine and [14C]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was quantified from multiple indicator-dilution outflow curves using indocyanine green as the intravascular reference substance. Pulmonary extraction at control (n = 15; mean +/- S.D.) was 81 +/- 6 and 78 +/- 9% for [3H]bupivacaine and [14C]5-HT, respectively. The apparent volume of distribution of bupivacaine was 38 +/- 9 ml/kg compared with 12 +/- 4 ml/kg for indocyanine green. Simultaneous administration of up to 300 micrograms/kg of bupivacaine did not affect the disposition of either radiolabeled amine; however, injection of 1000 micrograms/kg of bupivacaine significantly (P less than .01) depressed pulmonary extraction of both [3H]bupivacaine and [14C]5-HT. In the presence of 1000 micrograms/kg bupivacaine, the apparent volume of distribution of [3H]bupivacaine decreased to 24 +/- 9 ml/kg (P less than .01). Fifteen minutes after administration of propranolol (100-250 micrograms/kg i.v.), [14C]5-HT removal was unchanged, but the pulmonary extraction of [3H]bupivacaine was significantly decreased to 70 +/- 12% (n = 6; P less than .01). These data suggest that bupivacaine is extensively removed as it enters the lung and that the removal process is a combination of passive diffusion and a small component of saturable specific binding. The interaction of bupivacaine with 5-HT may be part of this specific binding (i.e., endothelial cell uptake) or may have been secondary to direct effects of large concentrations of bupivacaine on membrane function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Few quantitative data exist concerning the amounts of caffeine needed to prevent the cardiovascular effects of physiologic plasma adenosine concentrations or concerning the site of action (central or peripheral) of such blockade. Thus, dose-response curves were constructed for the antagonism by caffeine or 8-SPT of the hypotension and bradycardia caused by infusing adenosine i.v. or by giving bolus i.v. injections of the adenosine analogs 2-chloroadenosine, R-phenylisopropyladenosine or N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine. We also quantitated the suppression by caffeine or 8-SPT of the ability of adenosine to potentiate nicotine-induced hypertension and tachycardia. Caffeine (EC50 = 92 microM) and 8-SPT (EC50 = 48 microM) blocked the hypotension produced by elevating plasma adenosine levels from 1.22 to 1.74 microM. Similar drug doses were needed to inhibit the potentiation by adenosine of pressor and chronotropic responses to nicotine or to antagonize the hypotensive and negative chronotropic effects of 2-chloroadenosine, R-phenylisopropyladenosine and N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine. As expected, neither caffeine nor 8-SPT demonstrated selectivity for A1 (predominating at the heart) vs. A2 (predominating at blood vessels) receptor subtypes. Administration of as much as 50 mg/kg i.p. of 8-SPT failed to produce detectable brain levels of the drug, demonstrating its failure to gain access to the central nervous system and indicating that the site at which the drug antagonizes the cardiovascular effects of adenosine is peripheral.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The force generated by a nonadrenergic neural mechanism was reduced by both peptides whereas the force generated by adrenergic neural mechanisms was enhanced. Angiotensin III-induced inhibition of the nonadrenergic contraction was significantly greater than that of angiotensin II for all groups. Yohimbine (1 X 10(-4) M), an alpha-2 receptor antagonist, attenuated the depression of the nonadrenergic contraction produced by angiotensins II and III. Yohimbine (1 X 10(-5) and 1 X 10(-4) M) also significantly reduced angiotensin II-induced prostaglandin E (PGE) synthesis. Yohimbine only significantly altered the angiotensin III-induced PGE synthesis at an antagonist concentration of 1 X 10(-4) M. Rauwolscine (1 X 10(-8) and 1 X 10(-7) M) attenuated angiotensin II-induced PGE production and at a higher concentration (1 X 10(-6) M) reduced angiotensin III-induced PGE production. The alpha-1 antagonist, prazosin (1 X 10(-6) M), did not alter nonadrenergic contractile or PGE responses to either angiotensin. The alpha-2 agonist, clonidine, both inhibited the nonadrenergic neural contraction and enhanced PGE synthesis. We interpret these data to indicate that angiotensins II and III may act via separate mechanisms to induce PGE synthesis in the vas deferens, with angiotensin II effects being more dependent on norepinephrine release from adrenergic nerves.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of cibenzoline on transmembrane action potentials were examined in guinea pig papillary muscle. Cibenzoline (1-128 microM) did not alter the action potential durations at 50 and 90% of repolarization, the effective refractory period or the ratio of effective refractory period to action potential duration at 90% of repolarization. Likewise, the maximum diastolic potential was virtually unaffected. Cibenzoline depressed the maximum rate of rise of phase 0 (dV/dtmax). This effect was dependent on the rate of stimulation and occurred at a relatively low concentration (2 microM). The onset of use-dependent depression was monoexponential and dependent on the drug concentration, as well as the rate of stimulation. The rate of recovery from use-dependent depression also followed a single exponential time course but was independent of drug concentration and stimulation rate. When cibenzoline and lidocaine were combined in the tissue bath, dV/dtmax recovered with a double exponential time course. The first and second components of this recovery corresponded to the time course observed with lidocaine (first) and cibenzoline (second) alone. Also, the magnitude of the second component was less with the combination than with cibenzoline alone, indicating an interaction between the two drugs. In addition, cibenzoline shifted the curve relating normalized dV/dtmax to membrane potential in the hyperpolarizing direction. Finally, cibenzoline did not alter slow-response action potentials induced by elevated [K]o and isoproterenol. The authors conclude that cibenzoline acts as a class la antiarrhythmic agent in guinea pig papillary muscle.\r"

The objectives of the present study were to test whether the effect of MeHg on spontaneous release was Ca++-specific by substituting Sr++ or Ba++ for Ca++, whether the time course of MeHg-induced block of synchronous evoked release was altered by varying Ca++ concentrations or substituting Sr++ and whether the processes involved in the decay of elevated MEPPf after repetitive stimulation (asynchronous evoked release) were altered by MeHg. MEPPf was recorded continuously from the rat hemidiaphragm using conventional methods during pretreatment with 2 mM Ca++, 2 mM Sr++ or 0.5 mM Ba++ and subsequently with the cation plus 100 microM MeHg. The time to peak MEPPf in MeHg was not different under any condition; however, peak MEPPf was lower in Sr++ solutions than in Ca++ or Ba++ solutions. EPPs were recorded from the rat hemidiaphragm cut muscle preparation during pretreatment with either 2, 4 or 8 mM Ca++ or 2 or 4 mM Sr++ and subsequently with the cation plus 100 microM MeHg. The latency to block of the EPP in 4 and 8 mM Ca++ was not significantly different from the latency in 2 mM Ca++. The latency to block in 2 or 4 mM Sr++ was also not different from that in Ca++. In addition, under all conditions EPP amplitude remained virtually unchanged from pretreatment values until block occurred after 8 to 9 min exposure to MeHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rabbits were ovariectomized and, after 8 days of recovery, treated with 17 beta-estradiol (100 micrograms i.m.; estrogen group) or solvent (control group) for 4 days. Rings of saphenous vein and femoral artery (both without endothelium) were mounted for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (37 degrees C), gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2. All experiments were performed in the presence of inhibitors of neuronal uptake, extraneuronal uptake and beta adrenoceptors. In the saphenous vein, the estrogen treatment did not significantly affect the concentration-effect curves evoked by norepinephrine (either under control conditions or after alpha-1 or alpha-2 adrenergic blockade), phenylephrine (an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist) or UK 14,304 (an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist). In the femoral artery, estrogen treatment depressed the contractile responses evoked by norepinephrine (under control conditions) but not those produced by phenylephrine; UK 14,304 did not evoke a contractile response. The depressant effect of estrogen treatment on the concentration-effect curve to norepinephrine in the femoral artery was prevented by the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist, rauwolscine. The results in the femoral artery but not in the saphenous vein suggest that estrogens depress alpha-2 but not alpha-1 adrenergic responsiveness. In the femoral artery, alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation does not cause contraction per se but apparently can facilitate alpha-1 adrenergic responses. This probably results from a reduced density of alpha-2 adrenoceptors in this blood vessel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacological effects of A-4, a bis 4-methylpiperidine tertiary amine derivative of hemicholinium-3, were investigated. Systemic administration (i.p.) of this compound produced a dose-dependent reduction in acetylcholine content of several brain regions. A dose of 40 mg/kg of A-4 produced a 40% reduction in acetylcholine content in the corpus striatum and this reduction was maintained for over 4 hr. Increased choline content was found concurrent with the reduction in acetylcholine content. Reversal of the A-4-induced reductions in acetylcholine content was seen with eserine and oxotremorine but not with choline chloride. Acute treatment with A-4 appeared selective for cholinergic neurons as no significant changes were seen in norepinephrine or serotonin parameters of any of the brain regions assayed. Dopamine turnover was increased in the striatum. The neurochemical changes produced by A-4 were not seen with the bis 4-methylpiperidine quaternary amine, A-5, or hemicholinium-3 after systemic administration of doses which produced pronounced behavioral and toxic effects. Intraventricular administration of A-5 or hemicholinium-3 produced a selective reduction in acetylcholine content. No changes were seen in dopamine, norepinephrine or serotonin parameters. Thus, A-4 represents a novel hemicholinium-3 analog in its ability to act centrally after systemic administration and may be potentially useful as a pharmacological tool in understanding cholinergic mechanisms in the central nervous system.\r"

K3, but not dicumarol, cytotoxicity was abrogated by 1 mM cysteine. Isobolographic analysis of the effect of K3-dicumarol combinations, in the concentration ranges between 5 and 75 microM, on L1210 growth, indicated synergy between the two drugs. K3 (10 microM) caused a 3-fold stimulation of KCN-resistant O2 consumption by L1210 cells; addition of 50 microM dicumarol did not enhance KCN-resistant O2 consumption further, suggesting that K3-dicumarol synergy in L1210 was not due to dicumarol-mediated augmentation of K3-semiquinone-free radical formation. We examined the effect of dicumarol addition on L1210 cellular metabolites known to be affected by K3, i.e., glutathione, NADPH and ATP. Dicumarol prevented the elevation of the glutathione pool caused by less than or equal to 18 microM K3. K3-dicumarol combinations depleted the NADPH pool significantly, at concentrations of each which did not affect the NADPH pool. No synergistic effect on the ATP pool was observed. Thus, although the mechanism of K3-dicumarol synergy vs. leukemia remained unclear, it was possible that effects on the glutathione and/or NADPH pools contributed. We also investigated the effect of K3 and dicumarol on 45Ca++ transport by L1210 cells because of their effects on glutathione. Neither drug affected 45Ca++ influx or efflux rate constants. However, equilibrium 45Ca++ uptake was suppressed by K3 at concentrations lower than those which depleted glutathione.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that injection of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonists such as bicuculline methiodide (BMI) into the forebrain (i.e., lateral and third) ventricular system elicits neurally mediated increases in blood pressure and heart rate and inhibits baroreflex bradycardia in anesthetized cats. Similar administration of muscimol, a GABA agonist, blocks or reverses the effects of BMI but has no effect on blood pressure or heart rate in untreated animals. These findings suggest that GABAergic inhibition may tonically suppress a forebrain mechanism capable of modifying autonomic outflow to the cardiovascular system. In the present study, we used a technique designed to restrict the distribution of intraventricularly administered drugs to varying degrees in order to better localize the relevant sites of drug action. Our findings show that BMI increases heart rate and blood pressure and that muscimol counters these changes by acting at a site that is accessible from the intermediate (as opposed to the rostral or caudal) region of the third ventricle. In contrast, these agents influence baroreflex bradycardia by acting at more rostral periventricular sites. These findings are consistent with the notion that the GABAergic mechanisms involved in the cardiovascular effects resulting from intraventricular administration of BMI and muscimol are located in the periventricular hypothalamus.\r"

  ".W": "N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ), an irreversible alpha-2 antagonist, was used to establish and quantitate the receptor reserve at the alpha-2 adrenergic autoreceptor mediating inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE) release in rat cerebral cortical slices. EEDQ treatment had no effect on [3H]NE uptake or base-line release. Four hours after EEDQ treatment (0.8 mg/kg i.p.), the EC50 was shifted 7-fold to the right and there was a 21.5% decrease in the maximal response to the full alpha-2 agonist UK-14304. Using the double-reciprocal plot analysis, the equilibrium activation constant (KA) was calculated to be 1.41 +/- 0.8 microM. Similar analysis of alpha-2 autoreceptor response at various times after 1.6 mg/kg of EEDQ gave similar values for the KA. Therefore, evaluation of either the response of the remaining native receptors after partial irreversible inactivation or the response of newly synthesized receptors after nearly complete irreversible inactivation can be used to determine the KA of the receptor. Comparison of repopulation kinetics analyses for alpha-2 receptor response and estimated receptor number revealed that recovery of maximal response was much faster than actual receptor recovery. By examining the relationship between alpha-2 autoreceptor occupancy and response it was possible to determine that there is approximately a 60 to 70% receptor reserve; only 1.5% of the receptors need to be occupied by UK-14304 in order to obtain 50% of the maximal inhibition of [3H]NE release. The presence of a large receptor reserve must be taken into account when evaluating alpha-2 adrenergic autoreceptor regulation in the rat cerebral cortex.\r"

The contractile response to LTD4 was inhibited partially by tetrodotoxin (TTx) with early portions of the contraction being more sensitive to inhibition by TTx. This finding suggests that part of the LTD4 contraction is mediated by release of a neurotransmitter as a result of activation of Na+-dependent action potentials. Three approaches, study of the effects of substance P (SP) desensitization and of the effects of a SP antagonist on the LTD4 response and direct measurement of SP release were used to evaluate the possibility that SP is released by LTD4. Partial inhibition of the LTD4 contraction by SP desensitization, and by the SP antagonist, as well as direct measurement of TTx sensitive SP release in the presence of LTD4, indicates that SP is released from neurons by LTD4 in guinea pig ileum.\r"

Isolated aortic rings were mounted in tissue baths for the measurement of isometric contraction and 5-HT dose-response curves were obtained in the presence and absence of receptor antagonists. Prazosin, 1 X 10(-7) M, or 30-min pretreatment with 1 X 10(-5) M benextramine had no effect on the contractile response of aorta to 5-HT up to 1 X 10(-5) M, whereas 2 brom-D-lysergic acid diethylamide, 1 X 10(-7) M, shifted the 5-HT dose-response curve far to the right. Alpha receptor blockade with either prazosin or benextramine in the presence of 2 brom-D-lysergic acid diethylamide produced a greater blockade than that caused by 2 brom-D-lysergic acid diethylamide alone. When 5-HT dose-response curves were extended to 1 X 10(-3) M, three phases were identified. The first, a dose-related contraction, was mediated exclusively by serotonergic receptors. The second, a relaxation to approximately 40% of maximum, occurred at 1 X 10(-5) M and appeared to result from the rapid development of tachyphylaxis. The third phase was a dose-related contraction to concentrations of 5-HT above 1 X 10(-5) M and was inhibited by either prazosin or pretreatment with benextramine. Similar results were obtained in aortic rings from reserpine-pretreated rabbits. It is concluded that the contractile response to concentrations of 5-HT below 1 X 10(-5) M is mediated exclusively by serotonergic receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
