Physician use of behavioral prescriptions is a practical, familiar, and efficient method for achieving smoking cessation. Physicians should ask patients if they want to quit smoking, take a smoking history, motivate patients to quit by personalizing risks, set a quit date, and then follow the behavioral prescription. Behavioral prescription involves writing prescriptions based on a plan that leads the patient through five successive weeks of behavioral modification, culminating in complete cessation of cigarette use. Physician time involved is minimal, since the approach requires only two meetings in person--one at an initial patient visit, and a second at a follow-up appointment.\r"

The diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis depends upon clinical recognition. In the absence of ECM, tests for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi can provide an invaluable tool in assisting in the diagnosis. Children who live in or visit areas endemic for Lyme borreliosis and who have arthritis, heart block, or neurologic disorders such as facial palsy should be tested for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi if no other cause for the disease syndrome is identified clinically.\r"

Twelve patients survived for more than four weeks after the procedure; 11 of these 12 patients had a successful objective clinical response. The procedure was well tolerated, with little or no discomfort during catheter placement and the maintenance period. No serious complications were encountered. We conclude that the use of a small-bore percutaneously placed \"pneumothorax\" catheter in the management of malignant pleural effusions is an effective and more comfortable alternative to large-bore closed-tube thoracostomy.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) for melanoma of the extremity was first used clinically more than 30 years ago. Although ILP with chemotherapeutic agents has become routine practice in many oncologic centers, few studies have evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of particular agents. Two consecutive groups of 100 patients with stage I extremity melanoma of 1.5 mm thickness or greater were treated by ILP with either melphalan (L-PAM) or dacarbazine (DTIC). Demographics, clinical and pathologic stage, disease site, and complications were similar in both groups. No significant difference in the overall incidence of recurrent disease at two years was found between patients treated with either DTIC or L-PAM (22% vs 16%, respectively; P = .28). Patients who had perfusion with L-PAM, however, had a lower incidence of in-transit metastasis and recurrence at the scar than those having DTIC therapy (4% vs 12%, P = .06) at two years of follow-up. This preliminary report suggests that L-PAM may be more effective than DTIC in controlling scar recurrences and in-transit metastasis. Continued follow-up of this series of patients, with further analysis of patterns of recurrence and disease-free and overall survival at five years, will be necessary to better define the relative efficacy of L-PAM and DTIC in isolated limb perfusion.\r"

The elderly victim was more often white and the assailant more often black than when younger victims are involved. Also, the data suggest that the rape of elderly women may involve a relatively few rapists, and that their assaults are of a serial nature. This study concludes that these rapists are motivated by anger, possibly racially related, and a need to express power, rather than by sexual desire.\r"

One hundred two healthy elderly white subjects, 63 women and 39 men, carefully screened by history or chart review, were studied in the fasting state. All were noninstitutionalized without serious chronic or acute illness; their diets were nutritionally adequate, containing more than two thirds of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for all nutrients, and no subject was taking more than twice the RDA of fat-soluble vitamins. These subjects had higher levels of plasma and red blood cell carnitine, and vitamins A, E, and C. They had lower levels of albumin, transferrin, and zinc than younger laboratory reference subjects. Retinol-binding protein, serum and red blood cell folate, and copper levels were not different. With increasing age, levels of transferrin and vitamins C and E fell; all other measured micronutrient levels were similar. Albumin, vitamin C, and copper values were higher among elderly women, and plasma and red blood cell carnitine values and zinc levels were higher in elderly men. There was great variability in the micronutrient levels despite similar nutrient intakes.\r"

The content of DNA of the nuclei was determined by flow cytometry. Although the average tumor size was not significantly different, 17 of 56 patients with aneuploid tumors died of cancer compared with 2 of 72 with euploid tumors. The 10-year overall actuarial survival rate of the euploid and aneuploid groups was 72% and 67%, respectively (p less than 0.02). A hazards model of the data shows that the DNA content of the tumor is the most significant indicator of prognosis, with a 2.25-fold increased risk of death for patients with aneuploid tumors. These data show that the tumor DNA content can be used to identify a group of patients with T1 or T2N0M0 carcinoma of the breast with the same prognosis as a group of patients without carcinoma of the breast that would be unlikely to benefit from adjuvant therapy.\r"

The exact binding site within the LPS molecule against which antibody should be directed in order to maximize both cross-reactivity among bacterial strains and protective capacity has not been established. By developing a panel of MAbs that bound to various regions of the LPS molecule (O saccharide; outer, intermediate, and inner core; lipid A), we were able to determine that some epitopes in the inner core/lipid A region of LPS were broadly shared among different genera of gram-negative microorganisms, on the basis of immunoblot analysis of MAb binding to LPS. Pretreatment with lower doses of O saccharide-specific MAbs (2 micrograms per animal) provided protection against a lethal intraperitoneal challenge of viable Salmonella minnesota bacteria, compared with core LPS-specific MAbs, which required at least 1.0 mg of MAb per mouse to provide a similar degree of immunoprotection. Although inner core LPS-specific MAbs are less protective than O saccharide-specific MAbs, these MAbs will probably be more useful in the treatment of gram-negative sepsis because of their ability to bind to many types of LPS and enhance survival during infection, which is caused by a wide variety of gram-negative bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "Many growth factors are believed to act simultaneously in wounds. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine released by activated macrophages. In various concentrations it has inflammatory, cytolytic, mitogenic, antitumor, and possibly angiogenic or antiangiogenic effects; therefore it is likely to affect wound healing. With stainless steel wire mesh wound cylinders implanted in rats, we tested topical TNF-alpha in wounds, alone and in combination with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). The cylinders were injected daily for a total of 12 days, after which we measured the accumulation of protein, DNA, and hydroxyproline in each cylinder. TNF-alpha had little effect by itself; it inhibited the growth-promoting effects of TGF-beta, but it did not influence the effects of PDGF. These results agree with the in vitro studies showing synergism of TNF-alpha and PDGF and antagonism between TGF-beta and TNF-alpha. They also suggest that TGF-beta may have a negligible role in normal healing and emphasize that interaction of growth factors must be understood before appropriate clinical use can be planned.\r"

The effects of daily administration of marine oil--delivering 100 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid, 59 mg of docosahexaenoic acid, and 221 mg of omega-3 fatty acids per kilogram--were assessed in 33 New Zealand white rabbits. Six animals (group I) were immediately killed. In the remaining animals stable hypercholesterolemia was induced with a 0.25% cholesterol-enriched diet. After 7 weeks on this diet, six animals were killed (group II). Total plasma cholesterol had increased significantly (982 +/- 119 mg/dl vs. 55.6 +/- 7.1 mg/dl, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). The remaining animals randomly received a tap-water placebo (group III, n = 12) or marine oil (group IV, n = 9) daily. After 3 months, total plasma cholesterol was similar (p = NS) among group II (982 +/- 119 mg/dl), group III (965 +/- 54 mg/dl), and group IV (913 +/- 46 mg/dl). No significant differences in HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, or triglyceride levels developed between the placebo and marine oil groups. Two-hour, hepatic total lipid, neutral steroid, fatty acid, bile acid, and cholesterol synthesis rates were not significantly affected by marine oil treatment. Thoracic aortic cholesterol content increased during cholesterol feeding (5.7 +/- 0.9 mg/gm vs. 1.1 +/- 0.05 mg/gm, group II vs. group I, p less than 0.05). Marine oil supplementation had no effect on the progressive accumulation of cholesterol in the thoracic aorta (28.8 +/- 2.5 mg/gm vs. 29.4 +/- 1.8 mg/gm, group IV vs. group III, p = 0.84). The abdominal aortic cholesterol contents were also similar. These results do not support the use of dietary marine oil supplements for the amelioration of lipid metabolism or the prevention of atherosclerosis.\r"

Four dogs first underwent transection of all extrinsic and intrinsic neural continuity to the stomach, except for careful preservation of vagal innervation to the stomach (stage 1). Manometry catheters and serosal electrodes were placed in the antrum, and electrodes were fixed to the small intestine. After recovery, motility was recorded during fasting and after feeding. A cyclic motor pattern occurred in the stomach with a period that was not different from that of the migrating motor complex in the small intestine (113 +/- 11 minutes vs 112 +/- 11 minutes; p greater than 0.05). Gastric and intestinal motility remained coordinated in time. Feeding inhibited this cyclic motor pattern in stomach and intestine. Antral tachygastria (slow wave frequency greater than 8 cycles/min) was infrequent (less than 1% of time). Each animal was restudied after completing extrinsic gastric denervation by a transthoracic vagotomy (stage 2). Vagotomy did not alter the presence, appearance, or period of cyclic gastric activity, nor did it disrupt temporal coordination with the duodenal migrating motor complex or increase the prevalence of tachygastria. In conclusion, neither vagal nor nonvagal extrinsic innervation to the stomach was required for initiation or coordination of the characteristic cyclic gastric motility pattern during fasting; although vagal innervation may modulate gastric myoelectric activity, its precise role is not evident in this study.\r"

  ".W": "Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury is a common and important clinical event associated with the activation of an endogenous inflammatory response. Some of the mediators of this response may be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple organ system failure. The purpose of this study was to determine whether remote organ dysfunction--specifically, acute lung injury--occurs after intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. After an ischemia-reperfusion event in rat intestine, whole lungs were obtained for measurement of tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and myeloperoxidase values, and evaluation of histologic condition. In addition, lung microvascular permeability was assessed by determination of the rate at which iodine 125-labeled bovine serum albumin sequestration in the extravascular compartment occurred. Lung tissue ATP levels were no different in sham-operated animals than in those that had undergone 120 minutes of intestinal ischemia. Within 15 minutes of gut reperfusion, however, lung ATP decreased from 3.82 +/- 0.27 to 1.53 +/- 0.90 x 10(-7) moles/50 mg tissue, p less than 0.05. Neutrophil accumulation in the lungs, estimated by tissue myeloperoxidase determination, increased sevenfold (0.13 +/- 0.02 to 0.97 +/- 0.25 units/gm, p less than 0.05) after 120 minutes of ischemia and 15 minutes of reperfusion. Lung microvascular permeability increased threefold after 120 minutes of intestinal ischemia and 120 minutes of reperfusion (0.10 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.05 [lung/blood counts per minute], p less than 0.05). Intestinal ischemia followed by reperfusion is associated with acute lung injury characterized by increased microvascular permeability, histologic evidence of alveolar capillary endothelial cell injury, reduced lung tissue ATP levels, and the pulmonary sequestration of neutrophils. These data confirm an acute lung injury associated with intestinal ischemia-reperfusion and suggest a possible pathogenic role for the neutrophil.\r"

  ".W": "Indirect evidence exists that the reperfusion of ischemic tissue activates white blood cells. Thus local and systemic reperfusion injuries are prevented by making animals leukopenic or by inhibiting white blood cell lung entrapment by blocking thromboxane A2 generation. This study tests directly whether ischemia and reperfusion activates neutrophils, as measured by their oxidative burst, and whether thromboxane mediates this event. Anesthetized rats underwent 4 hours of bilateral hind limb tourniquet ischemia followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Plasma thromboxane B2 levels increased to 2750 pg/ml at 5 minutes of reperfusion, higher than the sham control (n = 36) value of 370 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). In untreated ischemic animals (n = 30) the intracellular H2O2 production of circulating neutrophils, as assayed flow cytometrically by dichlorofluorescein oxidation, increased from a preischemic value of 133 to a peak of 251 femtomoles dichlorofluorescein/neutrophil at 5 minutes of reperfusion (p less than 0.01). Treatment of neutrophils with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) 10(-7) mol/L led to a 91% increase in neutrophil H2O2 production before ischemia, and 5 minutes after reperfusion there was an enhanced response to PMA of 222% (p less than 0.01). Pretreatment of animals with the thromboxane-synthetase inhibitor OKY 046 (n = 36) prevented ischemia-induced thromboxane generation, neutrophil H2O2 production (p less than 0.05), as well as the enhanced response to PMA stimulation (p less than 0.05). Treatment with the thromboxane-receptor antagonist SQ 29,548 (n = 36) did not affect the increase in plasma thromboxane levels after ischemia but was as effective as OKY 046 in preventing the ischemia-induced increase in neutrophil H2O2 production and the enhanced response to PMA stimulation. These data indicate that lower-torso ischemia leads to neutrophil activation, manifest by H2O2 production, an event mediated by thromboxane.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism that explains the association between corticoids and acute pancreatitis is unknown. Our hypothesis was that chronic glucocorticoid treatment could adversely affect the course of hemorrhagic pancreatitis by acting through cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis was induced by feeding young female mice a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet for 60 hours. Treatment with hydrocortisone (10 mg/kg/day) was begun 1 week before pancreatitis. At the onset of the CDE diet, a group of hydrocortisone-treated mice were also given the CCK receptor antagonist CR-1409 (5 mg/kg three times a day). Control mice received injections of saline solution. A follow-up of 336 hours was conducted for survival analysis. Hydrocortisone given alone did not produce pancreatitis. Hydrocortisone, however, did increase the pancreatic necrosis caused by the CDE diet (from 40% to 70%) and significantly reduce survival (from 40% to 9%). CR-1409 completely abolished the adverse effects of hydrocortisone on pancreatitis. We measured amylase release by dispersed pancreatic acini from mice chronically treated with hydrocortisone in response to CCK-8. Treatment with hydrocortisone increased both the sensitivity and the responsiveness of the pancreas to CCK-8. We conclude that glucocorticoids alone may not induce acute pancreatitis, but they can increase the risk of a more severe form of pancreatitis developing. The glucocorticoid effect appears to be attributable to a CCK receptor-mediated sensitization of the pancreas to endogenous CCK. Thus, CCK-receptor blockade may improve survival in necrotizing pancreatitis associated with chronic glucocorticoid treatments.\r"

Calcium chloride increases the oxygen requirements of both basal metabolism (28 +/- 2 vs. 67 +/- 9 ml O2/beat/100 gm LV, p less than 0.01) and fiber shortening (11 +/- 5 vs. 62 +/- 11 ml O2/beat/100 gm LV, p less than 0.01). The postischemic heart has a decreased oxygen need for shortening (20 +/- 2 vs. 3 +/- 4 ml O2/beat/100 gm LV, p less than 0.01), paralleling the depressed inotropic state.

The groups were identified according to results of radionuclide angiography, mean injury severity score (ISS), and outcome. Group I (n = 71; mean ISS = 12.7) patients were those without myocardial contusion by radionuclide angiography. Two patients with cardiac complications were in this group. The patients with myocardial contusion were divided into two groups. Group II (n = 69; ISS = 19.5) patients had myocardial contusion as an isolated injury, and group III (n = 103; ISS = 30.9) patients had myocardial contusion and injury to at least one other organ system. Three patients from group II had cardiac complications. Eleven patients from group III had cardiac complications. There were no significant differences between the cardiac complication rate in the three groups, and each complication was present when the patient arrived in the emergency department. The predicted mortality rate based on ISS was 10% to 20% for patients with myocardial contusion, whereas the observed mortality rate for the groups (II and III) overall was 0.58%. We conclude that in the stable trauma patient myocardial contusion (1) does not by itself increase the risk of complication, (2) does not necessitate intensive care unit monitoring, (3) should be devalued when computing ISS scores, (4) may account for lengthy and often unnecessary hospitalization, and (5) in patients at risk for complications may be identified by ECG abnormalities on arrival to the emergency department.\r"

The effects of electrical preconditioning with 2 Hz continuous and 25 Hz burst patterns were evaluated, as well as the application of passive stretch to the muscle fibers during preconditioning. We evaluated the stroke work developed by these SMVs at afterloads of 30 mm Hg and 80 mm Hg in vivo, using a mock circulation device. During mock circulation studies, the SMVs were stimulated via the thoracodorsal nerve with either a 25 Hz or 85 Hz burst pattern. SMVs with 2 Hz preconditioning developed significantly higher stroke work than SMVs with 25 Hz preconditioning under all conditions of afterload, preload, and stimulation frequency (p less than or equal to 0.001). Under these conditions, for the 2 Hz preconditioned SMVs, passive stretch during preconditioning resulted in a further significant increase in developed stroke work (p less than 0.05). For these SMVs, with an 85 Hz stimulation frequency, stroke work averaged 410% of canine RV stroke work, and 59% of canine LV stroke work at physiologic preloads and afterloads.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine which portion(s) of the endotoxin molecule induces bacterial translocation and to examine the role of xanthine oxidase activity in the pathogenesis of endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation. Nonlethal doses of Salmonella endotoxin preparations (wild type, Ra, or Rb), containing the terminal portion of the core polysaccharide, induced bacterial translocation, whereas those preparations lacking the terminal-3 sugars (Rc, Rd, Re, or lipid A) did not induce bacterial translocation. Additionally, only those endotoxin preparations that induced bacterial translocation injured the gut mucosa, increased ileal xanthine dehydrogenase and oxidase activity, and disrupted the normal ecology of the gut flora, resulting in overgrowth with enteric bacilli. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity by allopurinol prevented endotoxin (Ra)-induced mucosal injury and reduced the incidence of bacterial translocation from 83% to 30% (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation requires the presence of the terminal core lipopolysaccharide moiety and that xanthine oxidase-generated oxidants are important in the pathogenesis of endotoxin-induced mucosal injury and bacterial translocation.\r"

This exposure of subendothelial collagen could serve as initiation sites for thrombus formation. This study tests the hypothesis that human beings (1) significant operative venodilation occurs and that it correlates with postoperative deep venous thrombosis (DVT); (2) operative venodilation can be pharmacologically controlled; and (3) this control reduces the incidence of postoperative DVT. Twenty-one patients undergoing total hip replacement had their contralateral cephalic vein continuously monitored with modified ultrasonographic instrumentation, with a continuous on-line recorder graphing venous diameter. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mg of dihydroergotamine and 5000 U of heparin (DHE/Hep) for prophylaxis or placebo, with investigators \"blinded\" Postoperatively, all patients underwent ascending phlebography. Patients in whom postoperative DVT developed (11) had a mean operative venodilation of 28.9% +/- 3.93%, and those in whom DVT did not develop (10) had a mean venodilation of 11.6% +/- 1.55% (p = 0.001). Only 17% (2/12) dilating less than 20% baseline diameter had DVT compared with 100% (9/9) dilating greater than 20% of baseline diameter (p = 0.002). Patients receiving venotonic agent DHE had significantly less venodilation and DVT (p less than 0.001) compared with patients receiving the placebo. Patients who had DVT and whose veins dilated greater than 20% were older than patients who did not have DVT and whose veins minimally dilated: p = 0.04 and p = 0.07, respectively. Although there was a trend toward increased venoconstriction in patients receiving DHE/Hep (p = 0.09), there was no correlation of venoconstriction with ultimate thrombotic outcome. Maximal venodilation occurs during handling of soft tissue (muscle), and this occurs significantly sooner than maximal venoconstriction, which occurs during bone manipulation. We conclude that excessive operative venodilation is a new and important etiologic factor that leads to postoperative DVT. Operative venodilation can be pharmacologically controlled with the venotonic agent DHE. The combination DHE/Hep reduces postoperative DVT by the reduction of operative venodilation in the presence of low doses of an anticoagulant. These findings offer a new approach for predicting postoperative DVT and an object rationale for developing effective prophylaxis.\r"

We assessed the ability of the naturally occurring oxygen radical generating system hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase (HX/XO) to cause gross gastric mucosal injury and measured the effect on regional mucosal blood flow. Local intra-arterial infusion of HX/XO into the vascular network of the stomach caused marked gross mucosal injury in the antrum and corpus. This injury occurred even in the absence of exogenous luminal acid and was aggravated by luminal acidification with 1 ml of 0.1N HCl. The selective oxygen radical scavenger superoxide dismutase (SOD) prevented mucosal injury caused by HX/XO. The effects of HX/XO and SOD were not mediated by alterations in regional gastric mucosal blood flow, as measured by the radiolabeled microspheres and reference sample method. These findings suggest that oxygen radicals are capable of causing substantial gastric mucosal injury by a direct cytotoxic effect independent of luminal acid or mucosal blood supply and give support to the concept that oxygen radical release may be a major primary pathogenetic factor in the development of acute gastric mucosal injury.\r"

Appendicitis is a common surgical disease, and its accurate diagnosis depends largely on clinical acumen. Ten third-year surgical residents prospectively evaluated 107 patients admitted because of suspected appendicitis. After taking a history, performing a physical examination, and reviewing laboratory data, these residents were asked to state, as a percentage, the likelihood that each patient had appendicitis. Sixty-three patients had appendicitis documented by pathologic inspection after appendectomy. Forty-four patients did not have appendicitis, as was determined by operation (17) or by in-house observation and resolution of abdominal pain (27). These outcomes were used to calculate a diagnostic ability score (DAS) for each resident. Residents were evaluated by standard methods including in-service examinations and monthly evaluations by the attending staff. Residents were also evaluated by nonstandard, but potentially useful, neuropsychologic and psychologic tests, including the trail making test, the Ravens progressive matrices test, the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), the grooved pegboard test of manual dexterity, and the profile of mood states (POMS) psychologic questionnaire. Cumulative scores were calculated and compared by multiple regression with coefficient variance analysis. The correlation (R2) of DAS with standard evaluation techniques was as follows: In-service (0.055), faculty (0.508), trails (-0.293), Ravens (0.028), PASAT (0.251), dexterity (0.432), POMS (0.381). We found that (1) the DAS is a discriminating clinical test; (2) the DAS correlates with subjective faculty evaluation; and (3) the DAS does not correlate with in-service examination scores. We conclude that faculty evaluation remains the best currently applied test of surgical resident clinical proficiency as measured by the DAS.\r"

Based on these two facts, a hypothesis is proposed that endotoxin-triggered KC release intermediates of L-arginine metabolism that inhibit HC protein synthesis by oxidizing iron at critical mitochondrial enzymes, thus interfering with mitochondrial respiration and energy production. Results of experiments testing this hypothesis showed that the metabolism of L-arginine was required for inhibition of protein synthesis and iron release and that the end products of L-arginine metabolism did not possess cytostatic or cytotoxic activity toward HC. The possibility that this cell culture phenomenon might provide insights into the mechanism of hepatic insufficiency in sepsis is raised.\r"

Groups of 10 mice underwent a 2.5 cm dorsal skin incision with subcutaneous placement of polyvinyl alcohol sponges. Starting on the day of wounding, the following daily injections were given: (1) thymopentin (TP5), an active synthetic pentapeptide of thymopoietin, a naturally occurring thymic hormone (1 microgram/day/IM); (2) thymulin or facteur thymique serique (FTS), a naturally occurring circulating thymic hormone (0.2 microgram/day/IM); (3) control saline solution (0.1 ml/day/IM). All mice were killed 4 weeks after wounding, and wound breaking strength and hydroxyproline content of the sponge granulomas were measured. The results show that both thymic hormones impaired wound breaking strength and reparative collagen synthesis in normal and athymic mice. The magnitude of the wound healing impairment induced by the two hormones was equal in the thymus-bearing and in the nude mice. The data support previous findings, which suggested that the thymus has an inhibitory effect on wound healing.\r"

  ".W": "Protamine, a polycationic protein used to reverse heparin anticoagulation, is frequently associated with decreased oxygen consumption, systemic hypotension, pulmonary artery hypertension, and bradycardia. This investigation examines the hypothesis that these events reflect toxic effects of protamine on endothelial cells. Cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelium was exposed to protamine (12.5 to 500 micrograms/ml, corresponding to clinical doses 0.75 to 30 mg/kg), either alone (n = 6) or 3 minutes after exposure to heparin, 0.1 IU/microgram protamine (n = 6). ATP was measured 1 to 180 minutes after protamine by a luciferase-luciferin assay and cell viability determined by trypan blue exclusion. Ultrastructure was assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Polylysine, 25 micrograms/ml, a cytotoxic polycationic agent, was also studied. Dose-dependent reductions in ATP (range, -11% to -51%) and ATP per viable cell (up to -41%) occurred. Decreases in ATP did not occur until after 30 minutes with protamine alone, compared with differences as early as 1 minute after protamine with prior heparin. Progressive mitochondrial injury was noted evident by swollen cristae, vacuolization, and eventual disruption. Polylysine caused similar changes. Protamine decreases endothelial cell ATP and prior heparin exposure accelerates this effect. The toxicity may reside in the positive charges on these molecules and mitochondrial damage may account for reductions in cellular ATP and systemic oxygen consumption.\r"

  ".U": "89347197\r", 
  ".W": "The inhibition of atherosclerosis by estrogen has been shown clinically and experimentally, but the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Previous studies have shown that estrogen enhances the uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) while not altering membrane binding at saturating levels of LDL. In this study the effect of estrogen on LDL binding kinetics has been investigated. Computer-assisted Scatchard analysis of binding data suggests a single-site binding model. Estrogen-treated BAEC showed a lower binding affinity (Ka = 2.47 +/- 0.74 E7 M-1) than control cells (1.95 +/- 0.21 E7 M-1) (p = 0.0012). Estrogen-treated cells, however, had a greater binding capacity (Bmax = 1.26 +/- 0.07 E-10M) than control cells (Bmax = 8.49 +/- 0.44 E-11M) (p = 0.0004). The latter was due primarily to a difference in LDL binding at higher concentrations of LDL (greater than 40 micrograms/ml). These findings are consistent with an estrogen-stimulated increase in low-affinity binding of LDL to BAEC, which may not be directly receptor mediated and which appears to enhance the uptake of LDL at higher lipoprotein concentrations.

  ".W": "Surgical critical care (SCC) was recently identified as an essential component of general surgery by the American Board of Surgery (ABS). Previous studies have found limited attention to critical care education in general surgery programs. This survey was developed to determine the changes in critical care education, following the emphasis by the ABS. The survey determined the format for SCC education, the time and resources committed, and the views of the program directors toward SCC. Program directors of all 296 approved general surgery residencies were surveyed, with a 79% response. Most program directors (91%) agree that SCC is an essential component of general surgery, and 72% believe a separate intensive care unit (ICU) rotation should be used in SCC education. Education in SCC was provided by a separate ICU service in 110 (47%) of the programs. The remaining 53% used care of patients in the ICU during traditional services as their educational experience. The average ICU rotation for surgery residents was 9 weeks and usually occurred in the second year of training. In 97% of the 110 programs with an ICU service, lectures and conferences were conducted regularly. Seventeen programs sponsored critical care fellowships, and 25 additional programs were considering them. Ninety percent of surgical ICU services had faculty that consisted exclusively of surgeons or surgeons and other specialists. Only 53% of surgeons attending on an ICU service had a reduction in their other responsibilities. Despite overwhelming agreement that critical care is an essential component of general surgery, less than half of the training programs have an ICU service to coordinate resident education in SCC. If surgeons are to continue to provide total care to their patients, there needs to be increased commitment to SCC education.\r"

  ".W": "Methylxanthines are known to inhibit in vitro gallbladder absorption. Increased gallbladder absorption has been observed during formation of cholesterol gallstones. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that caffeine would inhibit in vivo gallbladder absorption and thus prevent formation of cholesterol gallstones. Sixteen adult male prairie dogs received a control nonlithogenic diet, and 16 were fed a diet containing 1.2% cholesterol. Half of the animals in each group received caffeine in their drinking water. Gallbladder and hepatic bile were examined microscopically and analyzed for biliary lipids and electrolytes. The gallbladder/hepatic bile ratios of bile acids and sodium were calculated as indices of gallbladder absorption. All eight animals receiving the 1.2% cholesterol diet formed cholesterol gallstones, whereas none of the eight animals fed the cholesterol diet plus caffeine formed gallstones. The cholesterol saturation index was similar, however, in both groups. In animals fed a control diet, the administration of caffeine significantly increased hepatic bile flow and decreased the gallbladder/hepatic bile ratio for both bile acids (5.4 +/- 0.9 vs 3.6 +/- 0.3; p less than 0.05) and sodium (1.26 +/- 0.03 vs 1.12 +/- 0.03; p less than 0.01). In animals fed the high-cholesterol diet, caffeine significantly decreased the ratios for both bile acids (9.0 +/- 1.6 vs 5.3 +/- 0.6; p less than 0.05) and sodium (1.37 +/- 0.06 vs 1.21 +/- 0.01; p less than 0.05), lowered gallbladder bile protein levels, normalized gallbladder stasis, and lowered serum cholesterol levels. In summary, caffeine prevented formation of cholesterol gallstones in this experimental model. The effect of caffeine may be the result of alterations in multiple biliary parameters including the inhibition of gallbladder absorption.\r"

Intracellular second messenger systems implicated in mediation of membrane receptor regulation of cellular events include the phosphoinositide and adenylate cyclase systems. In this study we have investigated the effects of direct postreceptor activation of key components of these systems on intestinal water and electrolyte transport. Rabbit ileal segments (n = 35) were arterially perfused ex vivo with an oxygenated sanguineous solution. The lumen was perfused with an isotonic solution containing 14C-polyethylene glycol as a nonabsorbable marker. Net fluxes of H2O, Na+, and Cl- in six experimental groups were calculated for three 20-minute periods: basal, drug infusion, and recovery. The control group had no drug infusion. Two phorbol esters--phorbol 12, 13-diacetate (PDA; 10(-5) mol), and phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (PDB; 10(-5) mol)--were used to activate protein kinase C, an important component of the phosphoinositide system. The inactive 4 alpha-phorbol 12, 13-didecanoate (PDD; 10(-5) mol) served as a drug-infused control. Forskolin at two doses (FOR; 10(-5) mol and 10(-6) mol) was used to activate adenylate cyclase. The control and PDD groups had no changes in the flux of water and electrolytes. Both PDA and PDB had proabsorptive effects, with the more lipophilic and potent phorbol ester (PDB) having a more pronounced, significant effect (p less than 0.05). FOR caused significant secretion of H2O, Na+, and Cl- in a dose-dependent fashion (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that direct protein kinase C activation causes a proabsorptive effect and that direct activation of adenylate cyclase causes a secretory effect in the isolated small bowel. The activation status of these second messenger systems has a major influence on the transport state of the intestine.\r"

When tumors became palpable (6 to 10 days), mice were assigned randomly to receive either SMS (4 to 50 micrograms) or acetate buffer (0.2 ml) subcutaneously twice a day. For MCF-7, mean tumor volume was significantly lower on day 20 and days 30 through 50 in SMS-treated mice than in controls (p less than 0.05), and tumor doubling time was increased from 13.2 to 19.0 days. Calculated growth increment was significantly lower with SMS than with buffer treatment (1.1 +/- 0.1 vs 1.9 +/- 0.2) (p less than 0.001). For BT-20, mean tumor volume of SMS-treated mice was slightly, but not significantly, lower than that of controls; however, calculated growth increment was significantly lower for SMS treatment (3.2 +/- 0.3 vs 3.9 +/- 0.4) (p +/- 0.001), and tumor doubling time was increased from 4.0 to 5.8 days. For MCF-7, flow cytometric DNA analysis of tumor biopsy samples demonstrated a reduced G2 + M phase with SMS treatment. We conclude that SMS slows the growth of both MCF-7 and BT-20 human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice and that SMS may be clinically useful in the management of patients with breast carcinoma.\r"

To determine the relation of gluconeogenesis to different degrees of tumor burden and subsequent tumor removal in the fed and fasted states, we examined the activity and mRNA levels of the key regulatory enzyme for gluconeogenesis: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPck) in the liver of Fischer rats with a transplanted methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma. PEPck activity in liver cytosol, after a 24-hour fast, was significantly higher in the tumor-bearing rats than in their pair-fed controls. The increase in enzyme activity was clearly evident at 8% tumor burden and correlated positively with the degree of tumor burden (r = 0.85, p less than 0.01). Removal of the tumor produced a complete reversal of PEPck activity 10 days after excision. Regular feeding also abolished this increased enzyme activity. A similar trend was seen in the mitochondria. PEPck mRNA levels of rats with greater than 11% tumor burden in the fed state were decreased more than those of controls. PEPck mRNA levels were equally elevated in tumor bearers and controls in the 24-hour-fasted state. These results suggest that tumor-bearing simulates the fasted state associated with hypoglycemia, which in turn triggers induction of the gluconeogenic enzyme, PEPck.\r"

Little attention has been focused on efforts to accelerate erythropoiesis as a method of reducing homologous blood use. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has been shown to enhance erythropoiesis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of perioperative rHuEPO administration on postoperative erythropoiesis. Fifteen baboons were divided into three groups of five each. Group I received no rHuEPO. Group II received five daily preoperative doses of rHuEPO (1000 U/kg). Group III received five daily preoperative doses and 14 daily postoperative doses of rHuEPO (1000 U/kg). All animals underwent a laparotomy followed by an exchange transfusion to a final hematocrit of 15%. The time in days required to recover to hematocrits of 20% was significantly shorter in both groups that received preoperative doses of rHuEPO when compared with that of controls (3.3 vs 5.7 days, p less than 0.01). The recovery times to hematocrits of 25%, 30%, and baseline levels were all significantly shorter in the group that received both preoperative and postoperative doses of rHuEPO. The data show that perioperative dosage of rHuEPO significantly accelerates postoperative erythropoiesis. Perioperative administration of rHuEPO may reduce the requirements for homologous transfusion.\r"

The ventilatory response to hypercapnia was significantly higher (1.09 v 0.76 l/min/mm Hg/m2) in the diabetic patients. There was a significant correlation between the hypoxic ventilatory response and the heart rate response in diabetic patients (r = 0.56), but not in the control group (r = 0.28). In addition, both the ventilatory and the heart rate responses to hypoxia in diabetic patients had weak but significant correlations with the heart rate variation during deep breathing. It is concluded that the ventilatory and heart rate responses to hypoxia in diabetic patients are impaired, whereas the ventilatory response to hypercapnia is well preserved.\r"

  ".W": "Ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) relationships and gas exchange were studied by the multiple inert gas technique in 19 patients admitted to hospital with acute severe asthma (FEV1 41% predicted) before and during the administration of intravenous salbutamol, inhaled salbutamol, or 100% oxygen. Eight patients received a continuous intravenous infusion of salbutamol (4 micrograms/min, total dose 360 micrograms) and were studied before treatment, after 60 and 90 minutes of treatment, and one hour after treatment had been discontinued. Six patients had measurements before and 15 minutes after inhaling 300 micrograms salbutamol from a metered dose inhaler on two occasions (total dose 600 micrograms) and one hour after the last dose. Measurements were also made in five patients before and while they breathed 100% oxygen for 20 minutes. At baseline (fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) 21%) all patients showed a broad unimodal (n = 10) or bimodal (n = 9) distribution of blood flow with respect to VA/Q. A mean of 10.5% of the blood flow was associated with low VA/Q units without any appreciable shunt. One of the best descriptors of VA/Q inequality, the second moment of the perfusion distribution on a log scale (log SD Q), was moderately high with a mean of 1.18 (SEM 0.08) (normal less than 0.6). Measures of VA/Q inequality correlated poorly with spirometric findings. After salbutamol the increase in airflow rates was similar regardless of the route of administration. Intravenous salbutamol, however, caused a significant increase in heart rate, cardiac output, and oxygen consumption (VO2); in addition, both perfusion to low VA/Q areas and log SD Q increased significantly. Inhaled salbutamol caused only minor changes in heart rate, cardiac output, VO2, and VA/Q inequality. Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) remained unchanged during salbutamol administration, irrespective of the route of administration. During 100% oxygen breathing there was a significant increase in log SD Q (from 1.11 to 1.44). It is concluded that patients with acute severe asthma show considerable VA/Q inequality with a high level of pulmonary vascular reactivity. Despite similar bronchodilator effects from inhaled and intravenous salbutamol, VA/Q relationships worsened only during intravenous infusion. PaO2 remained unchanged, however, because the change in VA/Q relationships was associated with an increase in metabolic rate and cardiac output.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty eight subjects (mean age 64 years) who had been treated for tuberculosis by thoracoplasty in the past performed an increasing work rate exercise test, from which maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max), ventilation and heart rate were measured. VO2max was significantly lower than predicted, being 0.75 l/min in 17 subjects, 1.0 l/min in 10, and 1.5 l/min in one. Only one subject achieved a heart rate of 85% of the predicted maximum. The ratio of heart rate to oxygen consumption (HR/VO2) and heart rate at standard interpolated submaximal levels of oxygen uptake at 0.75 l/min (heart rate 0.75) and 1.0 l/min (heart rate 1.0) were normal. VO2max correlated with ventilation at maximal exercise (VE max) (r = 0.87) and FEV1 (r = 0.47). It did not correlate with resting arterial oxygen or carbon dioxide tensions, FEV1, maximum inspiratory pressure, angle of scoliosis, or number of ribs resected. The relation between ventilation and oxygen consumption (VE/VO2) and VE at the submaximal levels of oxygen consumption of 0.75 l/min (VE 0.75) and 1.0 l/min (VE 1.0) were normal. In 10 subjects a plateau of breathing frequency (fmax) was reached, after which the increase in ventilation was achieved by a further increase in tidal volume (VT). These subjects showed significantly lower values for the forced expiratory ratio, VO2max, and VEmax than those with a normal relation between tidal volume and breathing frequency. VEmax was correlated with FEV1 (r = 0.61), FVC (r = 0.46), maximum VT (r = 0.55), change in VT (r = 0.52), fmax (r = 0.56), and change in breathing frequency (r = 0.72). These results indicate that exercise in patients treated for tuberculosis by thoracoplasty is limited by ventilatory capacity and that this is due to a reduction in both dynamic lung volumes and respiratory frequency.\r"

Daytime and overnight measurements were made before and 2 and 10 weeks after they started protriptyline (20 mg daily at bedtime). Two patients had to be excluded before the second visit and one before the third visit because of changes in treatment for their chest disease. Protriptyline caused mouth dryness in all patients and dysuria in six men. With protriptyline there were no significant changes in total sleep time, sleep period time, or the percentages of total sleep time occupied by stage I-II and stage III-IV sleep. The mean (SEM) percentage of total sleep time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreased from 11.1 (1.7) to 4.6 (0.7) at two weeks and to 4.2 (1.0) at 10 weeks. After protriptyline the time spent during sleep with an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) below each 5% increment above 65% was less than the baseline time; the lowest SaO2 (%) reached during sleep increased from 64.5 (1.7) to 72.7 (2.1) at 2 weeks and to 77.4 (2.1) at 10 weeks. Lung volumes and expiratory flows were unchanged during the study. Daytime arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) increased from 57 (1.4) mm Hg before treatment to 62 (1.9) mm Hg at 2 weeks and to 66 (1.9) mm Hg at 10 weeks (7.6 (0.2), 8.3 (0.3), 8.8 (0.3) kPa). Carbon dioxide tension fell from 52 (2.3) mm Hg to 49 (1.4) mm Hg at 2 weeks and to 48 (2.0) mm Hg at 10 weeks (6.9 (0.3), 6.5 (0.2), 6.4 (0.3) kPa), but these changes were not significant. These results suggest that protriptyline may benefit patients with chronic obstructive lung disease by reducing the sleep induced falls in SaO2 and improving diurnal PaO2; a controlled trial is now required.\r"

Of the seven patients who took placebo, none developed symptoms or signs of peripheral neuropathy. One patient who had abnormal lower limb sensory nerve conduction initially showed improvement of sensory conduction but deterioration in motor conduction during the 12 month study period. Two further patients developed some slowing of motor conduction velocities in their right lateral popliteal nerve. Five patients received almitrine and all showed an improvement in PaO2 (mean from 7.0 to 7.9 kPa). None had symptoms or signs of peripheral neuropathy on entry to the study; one patient had evidence of impaired nerve conduction on electrophysiological testing. Three patients developed symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy during the 12 months of the study and a fourth developed peripheral neuropathy at 18 months, having continued to receive almitrine. Studies of nerve physiology showed abnormalities in the lower limbs of all four patients. Recovery was poor, possibly because of the long half life of almitrine. The studies suggest that almitrine may precipitate peripheral neuropathy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients should be warned of this potential complication so that the drug can be stopped as soon as symptoms develop.\r"

Fibreoptic bronchoscopy showed no structural abnormalities. Partial forced expiratory flow volume (PEFV) curves, generated from end inspiration by rapid compression of the chest wall with an inflatable jacket, were obtained from the total respiratory system and from each lung separately by inflating a Fogarty catheter in the contralateral mainstem bronchus. Expiratory flow rates and volumes during both tidal breathing and PEFV manoeuvres were considerably decreased in the hyperlucent lung. PEFV curves from the \"healthy\" right lung and from the total respiratory system were similar in shape and showed a moderately obstructive pattern. The right lung ventilated about four times as much as the left when measured by bronchospirometry and about three times as much when measured by the radionuclide technique.

Nine control patients with sarcoidosis matched for age and duration of disease, but without chest pain, were also studied by thallium-201 scintigraphy. Six of the 12 patients with chest pain had thallium scans indicative of myocardial ischaemia, but all had normal coronary angiograms; no patient from the control group had evidence of ischaemia on the thallium scan. Four additional patients with chest pain and one from the control group had other (non-specific) abnormalities on the thallium scan, so that scans were abnormal in 10 of the 12 patients with sarcoidosis who had chest pain. Most patients with anginal chest pain reported partial or complete relief of symptoms with nitrates. Anginal chest pain appears to be common in black male patients with sarcoidosis, is associated with abnormal myocardial perfusion scans, and may result from myocardial sarcoidosis.\r"

The purpose of this study was to assess the value of Doppler echocardiography of the inferior vena cava for the detection of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. Pulse Doppler echocardiography of the inferior vena cava and right heart catheterisation were performed in 29 patients with severe chronic obstructive lung disease. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 27 (10) mm Hg for the entire group; 62% of patients (18/29) had pulmonary arterial hypertension (mean pulmonary arterial pressure greater than 20 mm Hg). An adequate Doppler signal could be obtained in 25 of the 29 patients (86%). Pulsed Doppler echocardiography of the inferior vena cava gave normal results in 10 patients and disclosed tricuspid regurgitation in seven patients, impaired right ventricular compliance in seven patients, and both of these abnormalities in one patient. An abnormal Doppler echocardiogram of the inferior vena cava (tricuspid regurgitation or impaired right ventricular compliance, or both) predicted the presence of pulmonary arterial hypertension with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 80%. These results suggest that pulsed Doppler echocardiography of the inferior vena cava may be a useful though imperfect method of detecting pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.\r"

Anxiety and depression were scored on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and negative attitudes and beliefs regarding breathlessness and related aspects of respiratory health on a semantic differential scale. Scores for attitudes and beliefs about health and personal disability were pooled to give a general attitude score. Personality was rated on a standard scale. Subjects completed a questionnaire on respiratory symptoms and underwent routine spirometry, measurement of carbon monoxide transfer factor for the lung, and a progressive exercise test on a cycle ergometer. Scores for anxiety, depression, and negative mental attitudes were significantly intercorrelated; subjects with disordered personality profiles had above average scores for anxiety and depression. The psychometric scores were associated with clinical grade of breathlessness, lung function, and the physiological response to exercise. The general attitude score could be predicted from the anxiety and depression scores and from lung function expressed relative to age and stature, the combination of mood score and FEV1 explaining 38% of the variance in general attitude score. The general attitude score accounted for more than half the explained variance in the clinical grade of breathlessness and contributed more to the variance in maximal oxygen uptake (R2 = 0.11) than FEV1. It was associated with the level of habitual activity but not with smoking category, wheeze, chronic cough or phlegm. Thus attitude to disability reflected the subject's assessment of his exercise capacity and was closely related to the clinical grade of breathlessness.\r"

An initial study of 12 matched pairs of asthmatic and normal children was used to determine the mean amplitude of peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability in the two groups (7.8% and 4.4%) and the number of subjects required to show a significant difference. On the basis of this study 37 community based children with asthma diagnosed by questionnaire and 40 control subjects measured PEF four times daily for 14 days. Cosinor analysis of the data produced a significant fit in 20 asthmatic and 18 control children. A small but significant difference in amplitude was observed between the asthmatic (6.2%) and the control (4.2%) children. There was no significant phase difference between the rhythms in the two groups. Cosinor analysis explained 14% of PEF variance. It did not provide a reproducible estimate of phase between week 1 and week 2; the acrophase changed by more than one hour in 26 of 37 asthmatic children. The cosinor model may be inappropriate for the investigation of low amplitude circadian rhythms, especially when measurements are made infrequently.\r"

Twenty one patients attended for clinical assessment, pulmonary function studies, chest radiography, and antibody measurement. Eighteen had continued to keep pigeons, emphasising their commitment to the hobby. Despite continued antigen exposure pigeon related symptoms had improved in most patients and only five still had troublesome symptoms. Four patients had residual abnormalities of pulmonary function or chest radiographs and three had chronic bronchitis. Fanciers had attempted to regulate their exposure to the birds by use of masks and by spending less time in their lofts but this is an unlikely explanation for the benign course of their disease, as levels of antibody to pigeon gammaglobulin remained high, suggesting that appreciable antigen exposure was still occurring. In most cases a state of equilibrium between host and antigen appeared to have developed. This observation has implications for the clinical management and understanding of the nature of the disease.\r"

Maximal inspiratory mouth pressure was determined with an anaeroid manometer during maximal inspiratory efforts in a quasi static condition at residual volume. All patients performed 20 consecutive maximal inspiratory mouth manoeuvres, each one separated by 30-40 seconds. The mean (SD) values of MIP varied from 71.5 (25.5) cm H2O at the first measurement to 80.1 (27) cm H2O at the last measurement. Maximal values of MIP were usually achieved after nine determinations. It is concluded that to obtain a reproducible MIP value in patients with chronic airflow obstruction who are untrained and unexperienced in such manoeuvres a minimum of nine technically acceptable maximal mouth pressure manoeuvres should be performed.\r"

Basal serum cortisol concentrations were normal in 55 (61%) and raised in 35 (39%) of the subjects. No patient had a low basal cortisol concentration. After Synacthen stimulation, cortisol responses were normal in 81 (92%) of the patients and subnormal in seven (8%). After antituberculous chemotherapy the response to Synacthen stimulation was normal in all but one patient. It is concluded that adrenal dysfunction is an uncommon problem in patients with active tuberculosis, and that, contrary to recent reports, antituberculous chemotherapy regimens that include rifampicin do not have an adverse effect on adrenal function.\r"

There were significant differences between the histological types in the frequency of myasthenia gravis and of the different tumour stages, the mean age of the patients, and prognosis. Myasthenia gravis occurred more commonly in patients with cortical (33%) and mixed thymoma (35%) than in patients with medullary thymoma (11%). Five, 10, 15, and 20 year actuarial survival was 100% for medullary thymoma; 85%, 76%, 65% and 65% respectively for mixed thymoma; and 52%, 45%, 45%, and 45% for cortical thymoma. Medullary thymoma is a benign tumour arising late in life and there was no mortality in this series after surgery alone. Cortical thymoma usually presented in middle age and must be regarded as malignant; mortality was 50% at five years despite a multidisciplinary approach, with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy in all patients and chemotherapy in selected cases. Mixed thymoma had a better prognosis than cortical thymoma, but must be regarded as potentially malignant. One third of the total patients had died by 10 years despite radical tumour resection.\r"

  ".W": "To determine how the presence of generalised airflow limitation due to chronic obstructive lung disease affects the recognition of simulated upper airway obstruction, a study was carried out in 12 patients (mean (SD) age 57 (7) years) with chronic obstructive lung disease (FEV1% predicted 53 (22), range 21-70) and 12 matched control subjects. Patients and control subjects performed maximal inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume curves in a variable volume plethysmograph with and without upper airway obstruction simulated at the mouth with a series of polythene washers of internal diameter 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mm. In patients, as in normal subjects, peak expiratory flow (PEF) and maximum inspiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity (Vmax50) were more sensitive to upper airway obstruction than were FEV1 or maximum expiratory flow at 50% VC (VEmax50); but the reductions in all indices caused by simulated upper airway obstruction were smaller in the patients than in the controls. The fall in PEF (whether expressed in absolute units or as a percentages) consequent on severe (4 mm) upper airway obstruction became smaller with increasing severity of chronic obstructive lung disease. The subjects also produced flow-volume curves with and without 6 mm upper airway obstruction while breathing helium and oxygen (heliox). In both groups the effects of heliox on PEF and Vmax50 were increased when upper airway obstruction was simulated. It was confirmed that the functional recognition of upper airway obstruction is more difficult in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease than in normal subjects and this difficulty increases with severity of disease; an unusually large increase in PEF or Vmax50 while the patient is breathing heliox should raise the suspicion of coexisting upper airway obstruction, but such a pattern is not specific.\r"

  ".W": "Four hundred and forty five of 888 dairy farmers studied in an epidemiological survey four years previously were restudied to determine change in precipitins and in clinical features. Subjects answered the same questionnaire, which was filled in by the same nurse in the same winter months, and had blood withdrawn for precipitin analysis (double diffusion technique). Of the 445 subjects retested, 48 (10.8%) had been precipitin positive at the first study; of these, 34 remained positive four years later and 14 had reverted to negative. Twenty eight subjects previously negative for precipitins had become positive, so that 62 subjects in all were precipitin positive when restudied (13.9%). Of the 445 farmers, 369 were precipitin negative at both studies. The prevalence of symptoms, including cough, sputum production, wheezing, dyspnoea, and fever and chills, was similar for subjects who were consistently negative for precipitins and consistently positive and for those who changed from one to the other. Only one subject developed farmer's lung; he had precipitins in both studies. This study shows a fluctuation in the precipitin state of dairy farmers, suggesting that more farmers have precipitins at least once in their lifetime than are identified by screening at a single point in time. Relatively few develop farmer's lung or other respiratory symptoms. The presence of precipitins in a symptomless farmer appears to have no clinical importance.\r"

Within occasion variability in 232 children was lowest for FVC (coefficient of variation (CV) 5%) and FEV1 (CV 4%), and greatest for end expiratory flow rates. The precision of measurement for FEV1 supports its use for bronchial provocation tests, particularly those using a graded challenge. In this context the value of PEF (CV 7%) and mid expiratory flow rates (CV 11%) is limited by their poorer repeatability. Between occasion variability was assessed in 171 children tested at an interval of one to four weeks. The difference between the variances between occasions and within occasions was attributed to biological variation; this accounted for a substantial component of the between occasion variance in all indices, particularly FEV1 (73%) and PEF (66%). Together, within subject variability, sex, and height accounted for about half of the measured variance between subjects for all indices except FVC (68%). These results have implications for epidemiological studies.\r"

  ".W": "In the adult the distributions of ventilation and of perfusion show the same directional dependence on gravity. In children, however, the distribution of ventilation in response to gravity is the reverse of that seen in adults. The aim of the current study was to determine whether perfusion showed the same reversal in children or followed the adult pattern. Distribution of perfusion was measured with intravenous technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin and distribution of ventilation with inhaled krypton-81m. Eighteen children and seven adults were studied; they had been referred for lung scanning for various respiratory problems. The effect of gravity was examined by giving aliquots of macroaggregated albumin and 81mKr by inhalation to the subject in the supine and the lateral decubitus position. Counts in the dependent lung were compared with those in the upper lung. The dependent lung in the lateral decubitus position received more of the total perfusion than it did in the supine position in seven children with a normal chest radiograph (mean 7.0%, range 4.8-10.9% more) and in 11 children with an abnormal radiograph (mean 3.4%(0.1-10.0%)). Ventilation, however, changed in the opposite direction, falling by 7.1% (-3.2% to -12.8%) in five children with a normal chest radiograph and 11.2% (-2.8% to -19.3%) in eight children with an abnormal radiograph. Fractional V/fractional Q (an index of the ventilation:perfusion ratio) decreased in the dependent lung in the children when they moved from the supine to the decubitus position. The same directional change was recorded in adults, but it was significantly less than in the children, irrespective of whether the chest radiograph was abnormal. In children and adults with various respiratory problems the effect of posture on the distribution of perfusion is similar.\r"

At total lung capacity the mean (SD) density of peripheral lung tissue at the level of the mid right atrium was 0.0715 (0.017) g/cm3 and the vertical gradient of density was slight. At residual volume the density of peripheral tissue at the same level was 0.272 (0.067) g/cm3 and the vertical density gradient was curvilinear and more pronounced. Predictions of the gradient at residual volume were made on the basis of the known compliance of the lung and measured effects were attributed to the action of gravity on blood vessel distensibility at total lung capacity. These predictions agreed closely with the actual density gradient measured at residual volume and provide a basis for forecasting the vertical density gradient that would exist in healthy lungs at any degree of inflation. Departure from these gradients would imply local abnormalities of lung compliance, distribution of mechanical stress, or distensibility of vessels.\r"

In contrast, inhaled prostaglandin D2 (6 micrograms) alone and in combination with inhaled leukotriene B4 (12 micrograms) caused no change in the response to inhaled histamine, measured 30 minutes and three and six hours after the inhalation. These findings provide no support for the suggestion that leukotriene B4 has an important role in causing bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The possibility that higher doses of inhaled leukotriene B4 may alter bronchial responsiveness cannot, however, be ruled out.\r"

Sixty eight cases were identified (three female) with an age range at presentation of 48-85 (mean 68.9) years. Asbestos exposure was identified in 54 (80%) of the patients, most of whom had been shipyard workers. Pain and dyspnoea were the most common presenting symptoms. Pleural effusion was found in 57 (84%) of the patients, in a ratio of 2.6 right:left. The median survival was only 30 weeks from the time of presentation. Prognosis was significantly better for those presenting with dyspnoea than for those with pain (median survival 44 v 22 weeks). Postmortem examination was performed in 40 cases and metastatic disease found in more than three quarters. There was no significant difference between the incidence of the various tumour cell types or any relation between cell type and survival or the incidence of metastatic disease. A substantial increase in cases of malignant pleural mesothelioma has been found in an area of already high incidence. The use of rigorous histological criteria to determine histological cell type has shown that this previously valued variable is of no discriminatory value with regard to disease activity or survival.\r"

The change in total lung capacity has therefore been investigated during and after an acute attack of severe asthma in 32 patients by a radiographic technique. There was a small decrease (0.29 l) in mean total lung capacity between admission and follow up, though a quarter of the subjects showed a slight increase. There was no correlation between change in total lung capacity and change in expiratory flow rates, arterial carbon dioxide tension on admission, body mass index, and length of stay in hospital. Our findings agree with previous reports of a decrease in total lung capacity with improving airway obstruction, but the changes were small and inconsistent.\r"

If three inadequate evaluations are omitted, the combined rate of positive plus suspicious FNA biopsies was 92.9 percent (88.8% plus 4.1%, respectively).

  ".W": "Ten patients with hormonally refractory symptomatic metastatic prostate carcinoma underwent palliative hemibody irradiation (HBI). Four of the patients also had had previous irradiation to symptomatic focal sites. Two of the patients underwent upper body HBI with 5 Gy, while 6 patients underwent lower body HBI with 7 Gy. Two patients received sequential lower body HBI followed by upper body HBI. All 10 patients reported subjective pain relief within the immediate forty-eight to ninety-six hours following therapy. The average response lasted four months. Therefore the majority of our patients achieved symptomatic pain relief for the remainder of their lives which averaged five months (range 1.5-12 months). All 10 patients suffered transient but clinically insignificant hematologic toxicity. There was no death or other significant morbidity attributable to the treatment. We conclude that HBI is safe and effective palliation of bone pain in patients who have failed conventional therapy for prostate cancer.\r"

Of the 12 children with a late diagnosis, 10 had normal hips when examined in the neonatal period. Neonatal screening will not detect all cases of congenitally dislocated hip. If dislocation of the hip in childhood is to be diagnosed in a timely manner, it is essential that children's hips be examined at the time of routine well-baby evaluations until a normal gait has been established.\r"

Although parenteral administration often replaces oral administration in these circumstances, there is not always a desirable intravenous line available or repeated intramuscular injections may not be practical. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative bioavailability and time course of absorption of the commercially available parenteral phenobarbital sodium solution administered rectally in comparison with the same preparation given intramuscularly. Seven healthy adult volunteers were given phenobarbital 5 mg/kg intramuscularly and rectally five weeks apart. Eighteen blood samples were drawn over 288 hours. Pharmacokinetic parameters following intramuscular versus rectal administration were the following: area under the curve 5916 vs. 5253 mumol.h/L; half-life 112 vs. 113 h; time to maximum concentration 2.1 vs. 4.4 h; and maximum serum concentration 36.2 vs. 31.4 mumol/L. Mean relative bioavailability for rectal phenobarbital was 90 percent. Therefore, the parenteral phenobarbital sodium solution given rectally is well absorbed and provides a useful alternative route of administration.\r"

  ".W": "Interpatient variability in response to a given dose of meperidine, a synthetic opiate analgesic, may be partially explained by variability in plasma protein binding. Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), a plasma protein that primarily binds basic drugs, has been shown to increase in patients during stress such as trauma or surgery. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of meperidine binding to AAG and albumin as a function of both protein and meperidine concentrations. We performed a simple extraction procedure and a highly sensitive gas chromatograph analytical procedure. The results indicated that meperidine binding did not vary significantly with meperidine concentration at a given AAG concentration. However, meperidine binding increased significantly (p less than 0.01) as AAG concentration increased. Conversely, meperidine binding to albumin appeared to be independent of concentration of either meperidine or albumin. In conclusion, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein is a major plasma protein which binds meperidine in patients during stress. Further studies are suggested to elucidate the role of AAG on the pharmacologic effects of meperidine.\r"

Samples were inspected for visual changes and tested for changes in pH. Results of the HPLC analysis indicated that the famotidine samples remained within 94-100 percent and 99-103 percent of the time 0 concentrations at 7 and 14 days, respectively. Repeated measures analysis of variance demonstrated a significant time effect on famotidine concentration as concentrations changed over time (p less than 0.01). This change was small in magnitude, however, and concentrations decreased at 7 days and increased at 14 days. Famotidine is stable at a concentration of 2 mg/mL in D5W, NS, and sterile water for injection stored in PVC syringes at 4 degrees C for 14 days.\r"

In other cases, a discrete lesion may be present that obstructs the bronchus with inspissated secretions accumulating distal to the obstructing lesion. Lobar collapse may result in either case if a lobar bronchus is occluded by the excessive mucus or a discrete obstructing lesion. The CT manifestations of bronchial impaction in four patients with lobar collapse are described. In two patients, the lobar collapse and distal bronchial impaction were produced by a central obstructing bronchogenic carcinoma, whereas the other two patients had an abnormal mucus accumulation without a discrete bronchial obstruction. On CT, the impacted bronchi, best seen on postcontrast images, appeared as relatively low-attenuation branching structures extending from the hilum peripherally into the more opaque enhancing atelectatic lung. In the three patients who had surgical resection of the involved lobe, pathologic examination confirmed the dilated bronchi, filled with mucus (one patient), fibrinopurulent exudate (one), or mucous plugs with Aspergillus hyphae (one). This unique pattern of impaction within a collapsed lobe should be recognized on CT and prompt a search for a possible central obstructing lesion.\r"

  ".W": "Gallstones from 63 patients were evaluated by in vitro 1.5-T MR imaging, with T1- and T2-weighted images, and in 14 cases, a fat-suppression sequence (short-T1 inversion recovery imaging). Subsequent chemical analysis was performed on 43 gallstones. In vitro proton MR spectroscopy was performed on 14 stones. On T1-weighted MR images, foci of increased signal were seen in 46 of 63 stones (faint in 17, moderate in nine, and bright in 20). T2-weighted images showed areas of increased signal in 18 of 63 stones (faint in 15, moderate in three). T1-weighted MR imaging patterns were homogeneously dark (17), homogeneously bright (two), homogeneously faint (three), rimmed (dark rim and bright center, 32), and laminated (nine). Short-T1 inversion recovery imaging suppressed the foci of increased signal in 13 of 14 cases. Despite imaging characteristics suggestive of high lipid content, spectroscopy revealed only a single peak corresponding to a large water-proton signal. The T1 relaxation times of the water were shortened, ranging from 0.006 to 0.92 sec, explaining the increased signal seen on MR images of the gallstones. MR imaging characteristics (signal intensity, relative signal area, or imaging patterns) did not correlate with chemical composition. We hypothesize that different structural relationships must exist within gallstones of similar chemical content that alter the water bonding and hence the MR imaging characteristics.\r"

The cross-sectional display and superior resolution of CT are well suited to the demonstration of these fractures. Sixteen patients with pain and negative conventional radiographs were chosen for further evaluation by CT. Imaging was performed in two planes and showed 21 fractures. The transaxial plane was the most revealing imaging plane. Coronal imaging was equal or superior to the transaxial plane in most fractures of the scaphoid, lunate, capitate, and pisiform bones and of the bases of the metacarpal bones. The direct sagittal plane was the best imaging plane in one patient with fractures of the scaphoid and lunate bones. After discovery of the fracture on CT, surgical removal of the avulsed fracture fragment was recommended in seven patients and fusion was recommended in three. Eight patients had a marked decrease in pain after the surgical procedure. The accuracy of CT for the demonstration of occult fractures may result in earlier recognition of these fractures and a reduction in the associated disability.\r"

T1-weighted axial images, 600/20 (TR/TE) were obtained with the wrists straight, extended at 45 degree, and flexed at 45 degree. Each scan was evaluated with regard to positional changes of the median nerve and flexor tendons in the carpal tunnel as well as alterations in nerve shape. In the neutral position, the median nerve was found in one of two standard positions: either anterior to the superficial flexor tendon of the index finger or interposed more posterolaterally between this tendon and the flexor pollicis longus. During extension, the nerve always maintained or assumed an anterior position between the superficial index finger flexor and the flexor retinaculum, while the flexor tendons moved posteriorly. With flexion, the tendons shifted anteriorly toward the retinaculum, and the median nerve was found in one of three positions. It either remained in its anterior position between the superficial index finger flexor and retinaculum or became interposed between the superficial flexor tendons of the index finger and thumb or middle finger and ring finger. Nerve shape varied with its position. Anteriorly positioned nerves were flattened in the anteroposterior plane between the tendon and flexor retinaculum; this was greatest with flexion and least with extension. Interposed nerves were flattened in the mediolateral plane or rounded in configuration. In conclusion, the alignment of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel, its shape, and its relationship to the flexor tendons were variable and dependent on wrist positioning. These findings may explain why certain wrist motions, flexion in particular, predispose a person to carpal tunnel syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty patients with suspected internal derangement of the knee had arthroscopic examinations after MR imaging with both a standard T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) sequence and a three-dimensional (3-D) gradient-echo sequence. This series permitted correlative evaluation of 100 menisci and 50 anterior cruciate ligaments. Meniscal tears were diagnosed when intrameniscal signal communicated with the meniscal surface. Criteria for diagnosing anterior cruciate ligament disruption included absence or discontinuity of the ligament, ligamentous laxity, and hyperflexion of the posterior cruciate ligament. Arthroscopic surgery confirmed the presence of 39 meniscal tears and 11 anterior cruciate ligament tears in this population. The sensitivity and specificity of the SE sequence for the diagnosis of meniscal tears were 77% and 98%, respectively. The 3-D gradient-echo sequence had a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 88%. For disruption of the ligament, the SE technique had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 95% and the 3-D technique had a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 100%. Although these differences in sensitivity and specificity are not statistically significant at the p less than .05 level, probably because of the small sample size, the results show the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two imaging sequences. These data suggest that because of the complementary results of the two MR techniques, both the SE and the 3-D gradient-echo sequences have a role in the diagnosis of knee injuries.\r"

All masses were evaluated with both T1-weighted, 300-600/20-30 (TR/TE), and T2-weighted, 2000/80-100, images. They were reviewed to determine (1) if these images were sufficiently unique to allow a preoperative diagnosis based exclusively on the MR appearance and (2) if benignity vs malignancy could be predicted on the basis of the analysis of the MR image characteristics of the lesion. Concerning the latter, attention was directed to the margins of the lesions, to the impact of the lesion on the surrounding tissues (edema, infiltration, etc.), and to the intensity and homogeneity of the MR signal of the lesion. MR images were sufficiently characteristic to allow a specific diagnosis in 27 (24%) of the 112 cases (10 lipomas, eight hemangiomas, six pigmented villonodular synovitis, two hematomas, and one arteriovenous malformation). MR was incapable of reliably distinguishing between benign and malignant soft-tissue tumors.\r"

To determine the sensitivity of CT in the detection of perforated viscus in this population, we reviewed the CT examinations of 547 consecutive children who had had blunt abdominal trauma. Of six patients (1%) with documented bowel perforation, four (67%) had free intraperitoneal air detected preoperatively by CT. The remaining two cases had secondary signs of bowel thickening and unexplained peritoneal fluid. Free intraperitoneal air was not a specific indicator for bowel perforation. Of nine patients in whom CT studies showed pneumoperitoneum, only four (44%) had a ruptured bowel. The remaining five patients had pneumoperitoneum from sources other than bowel perforation including pneumomediastinum, bladder perforation, and previous peritoneal lavage. This experience shows that the CT finding of pneumoperitoneum is useful, although not specific for the detection of bowel perforation in children with blunt abdominal trauma. When free air is not present, secondary signs of bowel wall thickening and unexplained peritoneal fluid suggest a bowel perforation.\r"

This is because of anatomic location, instability of the acutely injured patient, and difficulty in localizing the exact site of injury. Between 1974 and 1988, 234 consecutive cases of traumatic injuries to the carotid or vertebral artery were evaluated by our group for intravascular embolization therapy. This included 206 cases of direct and seven cases of indirect carotid-cavernous sinus fistulae and 21 cases of traumatic vertebral fistulae. A variety of devices including detachable balloons, liquid tissue adhesives, microcoils, and silk suture were used with the goal of fistula occlusion and preservation of the parent vessel. This was achieved in 193 cases (82%). In the remaining 41 cases (18%), the carotid or vertebral artery had to be occluded by endovascular occlusion techniques because of extensive vascular injury in 28 cases and subtotal occlusion of the fistula in 13 cases. Complications included transient cerebral ischemia in six cases, pseudoaneurysm formation in five cases, stroke in five cases, and peripheral nerve injury in one case. The development of interventional neurovascular techniques has altered the management of these acutely injured patients. The preferred method for treatment has shifted from direct surgical access under general anesthesia to endovascular therapy under local anesthesia.\r"

The lesions were dated by history, when available. Hematomas were grouped as follows: acute, four; early subacute, four; late subacute, four; chronic, 13. Six collections were classified as rehemorrhage; and two patients had CSF hygromas. Subdural hematomas evolved in a pattern similar to intracerebral hemorrhage with the exception of chronic subdural hematomas, in which isointensity of hypointensity relative to gray matter was observed on short TR/TE images compared with the persistent very high signal intensity noted in chronic parenchymal hematomas. Hemosiderin was rarely seen in chronic hematomas. These findings are most likely the result of the absence of a blood-brain barrier, which allowed clearance and dilution of blood products. Subdural hematomas with repeat hemorrhage demonstrated multiple phases of bleeding with layering phenomenon and more frequent hemosiderin deposition. It is possible that the clearance of blood products, as observed in chronic subdural hematomas, is impaired or poorly functional when rehemorrhage occurs. The persistence of high signal from methemoglobin in a hematoma that is expected to be in the chronic phase also suggests repeated hemorrhage. Acute CSF subdural hygromas had signal intensities identical to CSF without MR evidence of blood products. At surgery, clear fluid under pressure was found. MR imaging, with its unique ability to delineate the various phases of hemorrhage, is well suited to the evaluation of subdural hemorrhage.\r"

These cases demonstrate the necessity for a slightly different approach to lesions with fluid levels. In one patient, imaging in the prone position allowed detection of a solid component; in several others, detection of the fluid level was dependent on the selection of nonroutine windows and levels. Fluid levels are classified with respect to their components and MR features. MR is superior to CT in imaging fluid levels. The appearance of fluid levels on MR varies with their composition, the ratio of the components, the sequence parameters, and the position of the patient.\r"

  ".W": "The laser catheter is a nylon vascular catheter with a metal tip that has an end hole as well as side holes. The metal tip is heated by laser energy delivered through an optical fiber embedded in the catheter wall. The catheter may be advanced over a guidewire for use as an adjunct to balloon angioplasty or for use in smaller vessels as the exclusive method of recanalization. We used the catheter to treat 34 patients with 54 discrete vascular lesions in 35 extremities. Twenty patients were treated for clinically significant claudication and 14 for ischemic changes. Laser catheter-assisted balloon angioplasty was used to treat six iliac artery occlusions, two iliac artery stenoses, 10 superficial femoral artery occlusions, 12 superficial femoral stenoses, four popliteal artery occlusions, and three popliteal stenoses. Initial technical and clinical success in these patients, with follow-up periods of 3-6 months, was equivalent to the results of previous reports of laser probe-assisted balloon angioplasty. In 11 patients, 15 of 17 popliteal or tibial-peroneal lesions were treated with the laser catheter without subsequent balloon angioplasty. The treatment was successful in eight of these patients, with follow-ups for up to 6 months. Our results suggest that the laser catheter is a useful device for the treatment of vascular stenosis or occlusion when used either as an adjunct to balloon angioplasty or in smaller vessels as the exclusive method for angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Thin interslice gaps and large imaging volumes are detrimental to MR signal and contrast, especially when the body coil is used. To show the influence of these two factors on fat and water signal and contrast, we performed a series of in vitro experiments. A cylinder filled with water and another filled with oil were imaged transaxially (TR = 2000 msec; TE = 20 and 70 msec) with different interslice gaps (0-150% slice thickness). A series of images was obtained to cover a 40-cm imaging volume. Increasing interslice gap thickness increased water signal without affecting fat signal, resulting in a decrease in fat/water contrast on TE = 20 msec (less T1-weighting) and increasing contrast on TE = 70 msec (more T2-weighting). Contrast nearly doubled when the interslice gap was increased from 10% to 75%. As slices moved away from the central slice, fat and water signals decreased slowly to 12.5 cm off center. Signal loss was significant with offsets greater than 12.5 cm. These results emphasize that to obtain proper contrast on T2-weighted images, the optimal interslice gap should be used and the region of interest should be near the central slice. Otherwise, images should be interpreted with caution.\r"

  ".W": "Influences that determine a drug's effects include pharmacokinetic factors (the serum concentrations of drug as determined by the drug dose, absorption, distribution, and excretion) and pharmacodynamic factors (the intensity of drug effect). Most assessments of drug effect focus on the therapeutic range, i.e., the serum concentrations below which therapeutic effects are unlikely and above which toxic effects may be seen. A goal for many treatment regimens is to maintain serum drug concentrations within the therapeutic range. Maintenance of drug concentrations within the therapeutic range can be difficult with many traditional oral dosage formulations. Soon after administration of standard tablets, capsules, or liquids, a pronounced peak level is observed in serum. At the end of a dosage interval, serum concentrations are frequently below those needed to exert therapeutic effect. One reason for the wide range in serum concentrations with standard oral formulations is that these products usually exhibit first-order drug absorption, in which the rate of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract continually varies following a dose (from high to low) and is directly determined by the amount of drug remaining in the gastrointestinal tract. First-order absorption, therefore, results in changing absorption rates, wide swings in serum drug concentrations, a relatively short duration of action, and often, inconsistent drug effects over a dosage interval. One way to address the problems with standard oral products that have first-order absorption is to produce products that control drug release and absorption. A large number of controlled-release oral products are now on the market and use a variety of technologies. The ideal controlled-release formulation would result in zero-order drug absorption, in which the rate of drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract would be constant and not determined by the amount of drug in the gastrointestinal tract. Zero-order absorption, therefore, results in an unchanging absorption rate, consistent serum levels, a longer duration of action, and more steady drug effect. Zero-order absorption is particularly preferable in situations that require a consistent, long-term therapeutic effect, e.g., in patients with hypertension, asthma, or arrhythmias. Of all the controlled-release preparations on the market, however, very few exhibit zero-order absorption; most can be categorized somewhere between first- and zero-order kinetics. An advanced-technology tablet has been invented to produce zero-order drug absorption for prazosin and nifedipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Immediate type-generalized reactions to protamine sulfate are uncommon but may be fatal. The mechanisms of severe or fatal reactions are unknown in most cases. One theory is that contaminating fish (salmon) proteins present in protamine solutions induce anaphylaxis in salmon-sensitive subjects. A second hypothesis is that protamine interacts with anti-salmon IgE to cause anaphylaxis. We assessed these hypotheses by establishing an indirect amplified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgE to salmon. Sera obtained from two subjects anaphylactically sensitive to salmon demonstrated high binding to salmon that was not inhibited by preincubation of sera with 500 or 1000 micrograms of protamine or Aspergillus fumigatus. Serum from a patient who experienced anaphylactic shock from protamine was indistinguishable from control sera in the ELISA for IgE to salmon. Anti-protamine IgE could not be demonstrated in separate experiments. The assays prove that 1) serum IgE to salmon is not inhibited by protamine and 2) serum from a patient experiencing a severe reaction to protamine did not contain IgE to salmon or protamine. The experiments do not support the notion that there is cross-reactivity between IgE to salmon and protamine sulfate in the cases evaluated.\r"

Central, obstructive, and mixed patterns of sleep apnea are commonly observed in hypothyroidism.

Nonlesioned areas in the same aortas showed normal endothelium with minimal development of stress fibers, which was no different from the appearance of endothelium in chow-fed rabbits. Microtubule organization revealed by immunofluorescence appeared normal in all areas. The development of stress fibers may be related to an altered substratum for endothelial attachment. This study provided no evidence to relate stress fiber formation with lesion initiation, but an association with well-developed foam cell lesions was evident.\r"

The n-butyl boronic acid derivative of Med I also was evaluated. The delay in onset of the depressor response to Med I was reduced by the injection of Med I into the portal vein; that of SA and MO was not. Med I, SA, and MO were activated by the liver, while APRL and HAG were not. Tween 20 inhibited Med I, SA, and MO, but not APRL and HAG. Proadifen (SKF 525A) inhibited Med I, but not SA and MO.

Despite these differences, the sheltered group delivered significantly fewer infants of low birth weight and preterm gestation than the control group. Variables assessed in this study fail to explain this difference. It is concluded that the services offered in a maternity shelter can have a positive impact on the reduction of low birth weight deliveries in a group of high-risk patients.

  ".W": "The mechanisms responsible for the onset and progression of preterm labor are poorly understood. In the present study a total of 115 amniotic fluid specimens were analyzed for a lipid that has not previously been detected in amniotic fluid. This glycolipid was identified as ceramide lactoside. It was found in two-dimensional thin-layer chromatograms for evaluation of lung maturity and quantified by gas chromatography. Ceramide lactoside concentrations in amniotic fluid were low in spontaneous labor at term (1.7 +/- 0.7 nmol/ml) and in pregnancies that were not associated with spontaneous preterm labor (1.4 +/- 0.6 nmol/ml). The concentrations were high in chorioamnionitis with signs of infection (11.8 +/- 5.8 nmol/ml) and in preterm labor without clinical signs of chorioamnionitis (5.4 +/- 4.0 nmol/ml). A high ceramide lactoside (greater than or equal to 5 nmol/ml) predicted chorioamnionitis with signs of infection at a sensitivity and a specificity of 94% and 95%, respectively. A moderately high ceramide lactoside concentration (greater than or equal to 2.5 nmol/ml) predicted spontaneous preterm labor: sensitivity, 82%; specificity, 95%. Little, if any, ceramide lactoside was present in urine, vernix, normal fetal membranes, or lung effluent, whereas this glycolipid was present in large amounts in granulocytes and in inflamed fetal membranes. We propose that phagocytosing granulocytes release ceramide lactoside into amniotic fluid.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the potential myocardial ischemic effects of ritodrine, we studied 36 singleton and four twin preterm pregnancies during ritodrine therapy. We serially determined serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK-MB fraction) and lactic dehydrogenase isoenzymes and performed electrocardiography before and during ritodrine infusion and again within the first 24 hours of oral drug therapy. We observed that serum CPK-MB and lactic dehydrogenase isoenzymes remained within the normal range during therapy periods. The incidence of sinus tachycardia and non-specific T wave changes were 100% and 25%, respectively. In three of four twin pregnancies, ST-T segment depression in leads I, V4, V5, and V6 of the electrocardiogram was noted. Our study suggests that (1) the recommended ritodrine regimen does not produce direct myocardial damage, and (2) ritodrine may cause cardiac ischemia as determined by electrocardiography, which theoretically would progress to myocardial damage if not treated properly.\r"

A system for continuous tissue pH monitoring of the fetus is evaluated in this study of 59 patients. There was poor correlation of tissue pH values and capillary scalp pH values in 19 cases (r = 0.487), and no significant correlation of tissue pH values to the outcome measurements of Apgar scores and cord gas levels. The benefits realized were those of monitoring the trend of tissue pH over time. We believe that a continuous pH monitoring system offers several advantages over intermittent fetal scalp sampling. Further refinement of the technology employed may offer such a system in the future.\r"

  ".U": "89349255\r", 
  ".W": "A growing body of evidence supports a causal link between subclinical intrauterine infection and preterm labor. The mechanisms responsible for the onset of parturition in this setting have not been elucidated. The conventional view has been that bacterial products increase prostaglandin biosynthesis by intrauterine tissues and this, in turn, leads to the onset of labor. An alternative or complementary mechanism is that microbial products activate the host monocyte-macrophage system and that cytokines released during this process signal the initiation of parturition by stimulating prostaglandin biosynthesis by intrauterine tissues. This study was conducted to determine if cachectin-tumor necrosis factor is present in the amniotic fluid of women with intraamniotic infection and whether this cytokine can alter the rate of prostaglandin biosynthesis by intrauterine tissues. Amniotic fluid from 54 women was assayed for tumor necrosis factor. Tumor necrosis factor was not detectable in the amniotic fluid of women without intraamniotic infection regardless of the presence or absence of term or preterm labor. On the other hand, the amniotic fluid of 11 of 15 women with preterm labor and intraamniotic infection had measurable tumor necrosis factor. This cytokine stimulated prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis by amnion cells in monolayer culture in a dose-dependent fashion. These data support the concept that macrophage activation is involved in the onset of human parturition in the setting of infection. We propose that the host (fetus and/or mother) signals the onset of parturition through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines released in response to bacterial invasion.\r"

Birth weight differences greater than 20% occurred no more commonly in monochorionic than in dichorionic pregnancies. Of the four pregnancies with a coexisting hemoglobin difference greater than 5 gm/dl and birth weight difference greater than 20%, only one had a monochorionic placenta and therefore likelihood of vascular anastomoses. Diagnosis of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome cannot be definitively established by current standard diagnostic criteria.\r"

We also performed 706 first-trimester abortions at the time of laparoscopic sterilization. Two perforations (2.8/1000 procedures) were reported before laparoscopy. Twelve (15.6/1000 procedures) unsuspected perforations were discovered during direct laparoscopic visualization. This represents a 19.8/1000 procedure rate of perforation (14 cases). All 22 patients with perforations were managed conservatively, and no immediate or late complications were noted. Our data suggest that the true incidence of uterine perforations is significantly underestimated and serious complications caused by perforations are rare. Conservative therapy is recommended rather than early surgical intervention.\r"

Immunosuppressive activity was tested in the supernatants of cultured biopsy samples of each group and found to be significantly lower in the incipient miscarriage group. These findings could represent alterations associated with the process of miscarriage, such as inflammation, or there may be deficient suppressor cell activity at the fetomaternal interface as the reason for \"rejection\" of the early embryo.\r"

An arm ergometer was used to maintain heart rate in the training range. Glycemic response was monitored by glycosylated hemoglobin, a 50 gm oral glucose challenge with a fasting and 1-hour plasma glucose, and blood glucose self-monitoring, fasting and 1 hour after meals. Week 1 glycemic parameters were the same for both groups. Week 6 data (mean +/- SD) were as follows: group I glycosylated hemoglobin, 4.7% + 0.2% versus group II, 4.2% +/- 0.2%; p less than 0.001. The group I glucose challenge fasting value was 87.6 +/- 6.2 versus 70.1 +/- 6.6 mg/dl, p less than 0.001 for group II. The group I 1-hour plasma glucose challenge result was 187.5 +/- 12.9 mg/dl versus 105.9 +/- 18.9 mg/dl for group II, p less than 0.001. The glycemic levels diverged between the groups at week 4. We conclude that arm ergometer training is feasible in women with gestational diabetes mellitus and results in lower glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting, and 1-hour plasma glucose concentrations than diet alone. Arm ergometer training may provide a useful treatment option for women with gestational diabetes mellitus and may obviate insulin treatment.\r"

The goals of this study were twofold: first, to assess the different zinc indices (plasma, red blood cell zinc, heat-labile alkaline phosphatase, and placental zinc) in normotensive and hypertensive parturients to determine whether they are altered in the different types of hypertension that occur during pregnancy; second, to assess whole-blood cadmium and placental cadmium with regard to hypertension and zinc status. Patients were diagnosed as having chronic hypertension or preeclamptic toxemia and were then further divided into groups on the basis of smoking status. Each patient was matched with a normal control subject based on age, parity, and smoking status. Forty-three hypertensive patients and their matched control subjects were studied. No differences were found in the various zinc indices between chronic hypertensive parturients and normal control subjects. However, in parturients with preeclamptic toxemia, the plasma zinc level was 19% lower than in control subjects (p less than 0.02); these patients had the lowest plasma zinc level of the three groups. Placental zinc was also 12% lower in patients with preeclamptic toxemia than in control subjects (p less than 0.04). Whole-blood cadmium and placental cadmium levels did not differ between control subjects or hypertensive patients. However, a significant positive correlation was found between whole-blood cadmium and plasma zinc levels in preeclamptic toxemia (r = 0.53; p less than 0.05). The results support a marginal zinc deficiency in parturients with preeclamptic toxemia but not in those with chronic hypertension. The role of cadmium in the cause of preeclamptic toxemia remains unclear.\r"

These data indicate that the myometrium is hyperresponsive and hyperreactive to oxytocin during term and preterm birth but not hypersensitive. The increase in oxytocin responsiveness of the myometrium may be fundamental to the initiation of labor and regulated by the increases in oxytocin receptors and postreceptor events, including gap junctions.\r"

We used Fast Fourier Transform and power spectrum analysis to determine whether the patterns of myometrial contractility consist predominantly of contractions or contractures. This analysis allows quantification of activity represented by each of these patterns of activity. We applied these methods to myometrial electromyogram and intrauterine pressure recordings in pregnant rhesus monkeys to characterize the changes in myometrial activity that occur after surgery, after intravenous indomethacin administration, and when food is withdrawn for 48 hours. We conclude that changes in the frequency pattern of myometrial activity provide important information in relation to labor and delivery contractions.\r"

To assess the role of luteinizing hormone in polycystic ovaries, it is necessary to evaluate the luteinizing hormone sensitivity of the specific tissues in the polycystic ovary. Therefore, we examined the pattern of luteinizing hormone binding sites in polycystic ovaries. Rats at 4 or 8 weeks after estradiol valerate treatment each received an intrajugular injection of iodine 125-labeled human chorionic gonadotropin. Some rats also received a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled human chorionic gonadotropin in the same injection. Ovaries were prepared for autoradiography. Dense accumulations of grains occurred over the theca of normal and atretic secondary follicles in all ovaries and over clusters of secondary interstitial cells. The iodine label was variable over the typically hypertrophied theca of precystic follicles. The theca of definitive cysts showed little or no label. These results indicate that cyst formation coincides with the loss of luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin binding to the affected follicles.\r"

  ".U": "89349285\r", 
  ".W": "Increased myometrial activity in the pregnant rhesus monkey occurs in situations in which plasma estrogen concentrations are elevated. Examples of such situations are after laparotomy, with or without hysterotomy, and before delivery. The increased activity occurs primarily in the hours of darkness. To investigate the possibility of a causal relationship between the rise in estrogens and myometrial activity, we infused androstenedione intravenously for 48 hours to the rhesus monkey in the last third of gestation. Myometrial activity was quantified either as an increase in the number of individual contraction events or as a change in the power spectrum at high frequencies characteristic of contractions. Androstenedione infusion was followed by increased myometrial activity. Maternal plasma 17 beta-estradiol concentration was significantly elevated at 10 AM on the second day of androstenedione infusion. We conclude that, in the rhesus monkey late in gestation, estradiol may play a role in the regulation of the contraction activity observed during the hours of darkness in several different situations.\r"

Flow cytometric proliferative indices may be useful for prediction of tumor behavior in non-DNA aneuploid endometrial carcinomas that are assessed as being a good prognostic type by other tumor parameters.\r"

This problem derives from borderline patients' conflicts between fears of abandonment and domination. When they move closer to others, they fear that they will be dominated; when they move away, they fear that they will be abandoned. Whichever direction they move, they experience negative feedback. This gives rise to recurrent oscillations between attachment to and detachment from others. Because the oscillations are reinforced by the ambivalent reactions of significant others and the involvement of third parties, family therapy is often indicated.\r"

Cyclothymic patients showed significantly poorer posthospital functioning than noncyclothymic patients. These findings raise questions concerning the scope of the hypothesized cyclothymic-bipolar spectrum. Minor mood swings in a variety of patients with poor posthospital adjustment may reflect persistent vulnerability to psychopathology.\r"

Risk factors for participation included income greater than $135,000, being a surgeon or gynecologist, having previously \"opted out\" of the Ontario Health Insurance Plan, being professionally dissatisfied, being politically conservative, favoring political activism by physicians, holding a positive view of the social consequences of extrabilling, and perceiving family, associates, patients and the public to favor the strike. Eighty percent of strikers, but 32 percent of non-strikers, met criteria we established for four strike-prone groups: the \"economically rational,\" the \"ideologically committed,\" the \"professionally disaffected,\" and the \"socially malleable.\" Respondents belonging to one or more of these groups were much more likely to have participated in the strike (64 percent vs 17 percent). Strategies to deal with physician militancy should address the multiplicity of motives that appeared to have influenced doctors in Ontario.\r"

Cases were members of Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound who were hospitalized for ectopic pregnancy from October 1981 through September 1986 (N = 211). Controls were randomly selected members matched to cases on age and county of residence (N = 457). All subjects in this analysis had had one or more prior pregnancies. Eighty-eight cases (41.7 per cent) and 177 controls (38.7 per cent) had a history of one or more induced abortions. The relative risk of ectopic pregnancy associated with one abortion was 0.9 (95 per cent confidence interval 0.6, 1.3), adjusted for age, county, reference date, religion, gravidity, age at first pregnancy, lifetime number of sexual partners, and miscarriage history. Among women with two or more prior pregnancies, the risk associated with two or more abortions was 1.2 (0.6, 2.4). Controlling for pelvic inflammatory disease and use of intrauterine devices did not alter these risks. We conclude that legal abortion as performed in the US since 1970 has little or no influence on a woman's risk of ectopic pregnancy in subsequent pregnancies.\r"

Women with ectopic pregnancy (n = 634) seen at University of Illinois Perinatal Network Hospitals were compared to women who were delivered of a single live-born infant (n = 4287). Adjusted for age and race, women who reported smoking during pregnancy had a greater than twofold risk of ectopic pregnancy (Odds Ratio = 2.5, 95% confidence interval = 1.9, 3.2) compared to women who never smoked. The estimated relative risk rose from 1.4 (95% CI = 0.8, 2.5) for a woman smoking fewer than 10 cigarettes a day to 5.0 (95% CI = 2.9, 8.7) at one and a half or more packs of cigarettes per day (p-value for trend less than 0.001). Although further basic and epidemiologic research is necessary, the observed dose-response relation strengthens the argument that smoking may be a causal factor in the development of ectopic pregnancy.\r"

Ninety-one percent of White women (n = 511) and 80 percent of Black women (n = 668) reported working during pregnancy. Black women who planned to return to work part time vs full time were more likely to breast-feed rather than formula-feed (adjusted odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.4, 3.7). Using Cox regression, Black women who returned to work had a shorter duration of breast-feeding than those not returning to work (hazard ratio = 0.5 (CI = 0.3, 0.9]. Black and White women returning to professional occupations had a longer duration of breast-feeding compared to women returning to sales or technical positions (hazard ratio for Black women = 2.4 (CI = 1.4, 44); hazard ratio for White women = 1.6 (CI = 1.0, 2.5]. In addition, White women in professional occupations had a longer duration of breast-feeding than women in clerical positions (hazard ratio = 1.7 (CI = 1.1, 2.6].

Data were abstracted from the records of 452 consecutive pregnancies among Cambodian women and 110 low-income Whites receiving obstetrical services at the same clinic and hospital in Lowell, Massachusetts. Pregnancies of Cambodian women were marked by a higher proportion of older mothers, grand multiparas, previous adverse birth outcomes, and short interpregnancy intervals. We identified maternal anemia (29.9 percent with hemoglobin less than 110 g/L) and inadequate utilization of prenatal care (32.3 percent with first visit in the 3rd trimester) as possible risk factors for the Cambodians. The prevalence of primary cesarean birth was only 6.3 percent in the Cambodians, compared to 15.6 percent in the comparison group, largely due to the infrequent occurrence of prolonged labor among multiparas. Despite the prominence of several risk factors for adverse birth outcomes in this population, major pregnancy complications were less common and the prevalence of low birthweight (6.4 percent) was close to the state average. Logistic regression analysis of risk factors for low birthweight identified young maternal age and short stature as the strongest factors operative in this community. Many of our findings are consistent with a strong cultural emphasis on managing the size of the baby to avoid a difficult labor and delivery.\r"

Bongaarts' proximate determinants framework is used to compare religious categories on behaviors that directly affect fertility. We found no difference in recent fertility between Catholics and non-Catholics in Puerto Rico (total fertility rate = 2.5). We also found Catholics and non-Catholics to be similar on age at first marriage (23.3 and 23.4 years, respectively), contraceptive use (71 percent and 69 percent of married women currently contracepting), and breast-feeding practices (mean duration of breast-feeding of 4.4 and 4.3 months). Differences were observed between less committed and more committed Catholics in total fertility rate, age at first marriage, and contraceptive use, but these differences were not large and were in the opposite direction from the expected. Our findings support the theory of convergence of Catholic and non-Catholic fertility for the US. Our discrepancy with findings from the National Survey of Family Growth is evidence of the cultural diversity in the US Hispanic population and indicates the importance of disaggregating by ethnicity or national origin when studying this population.\r"

After controlling for parity, a one point increase on the acculturation scale was found to be associated with a 1.19 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.34) increase in risk of maternal low birthweight (LBW) (1.98 risk increase for four points). The estimated relative risk increased to 1.34 (1.12, 1.60) with controls for age at interview, wealth, city size, and years of education; controlling for current smoking status reduced the relative risk to 1.31. US-born respondents were also at increased risk relative to Mexican-born, but this relation was explained by acculturation. The effect of education was found to depend on level of acculturation. Years of education was unrelated to risk among the Mexican-oriented, while increased education was associated with reduced risk in the US-oriented. These results suggest that factors associated with a Mexican cultural orientation may be protective against the risk of LBW.\r"

Only fetal deaths resulting in overnight hospitalization of the mother were reported. Seventy-nine percent of fetal deaths over 28 completed weeks since the last menstrual period (LMP) were reported versus only 10 percent between 20 and 28 completed weeks since the LMP. Ninety-three percent of fetuses over 400 grams were reported. The unreported fetal deaths were mainly those perceived by attending physicians as spontaneous abortion, especially missed or incomplete spontaneous abortion. Physicians apparently preferred the label of spontaneous abortion over stillbirth or fetal death whenever fetal maturity could not be substantiated, regardless of prior estimates of the date of the LMP. Fetuses as large and developed as potentially viable infants were the most likely to be reported.\r"

For measuring the public health importance of a possible association, the population attributable fraction (PAF)--the proportion of disease incidence in a population that is attributable to an exposure--is more appropriate. We determined sample size and power for detecting a specified PAF in both cohort and case-control studies and compared the results with those obtained using conventional estimates based on the relative risk. When an exposure is rare, a study that has little power to detect a small RR often has adequate power to detect a small PAF. On the other hand, for common exposures, even a relatively large study may have inadequate power to detect a small PAF. These comparisons emphasize the importance of selecting the most pertinent measure of association, either relative risk or population attributable fraction, when calculating power and sample size.\r"

This transition normally occurs with penetration of intact skin of the mammalian host, but can be accomplished by vortexing and incubating organisms at 37 degrees C in complex tissue culture medium (e.g., Earle's lactalbumin). We determined the minimal conditions that initiate surface maturation by monitoring surface changes by transmission electron microscopy and surface fluorescein-conjugated Con A labeling. Cercariae incubated in water for 2 hr at 37 degrees C retained their trilaminate surface and were non-fluorescent. After incubation in 116 mM NaCl for 3 hr at 23 degrees C, no organisms were covered by intense surface fluorescence; increasing the temperature to 37 degrees C resulted in 50% of the parasites becoming fluorescent. The addition of 26 mM NaHCO3 (pH 7.4) to parasites incubated in NaCl at 37 degrees C resulted in 98% of the organisms binding Con A. No significant difference in surface Con A binding was found between organisms incubated with the chelators EGTA or EDTA and controls. Mechanical stimulus by itself was not effective in stimulating surface maturation. The conditions that initiated surface maturation were elevation of temperature to 37 degrees C and NaHCO3-containing medium.\r"

Children were allocated at random to placebo (PL, n = 72) or albendazole (A, n = 78) groups, treated, and re-examined 6 months later. The A group gained significantly more than the PL group in weight (1.3 kg), percent weight for age (4.5% age points), percent height for age (0.5% age points), percent weight for height (4.3% age points), percent arm circumference (2.9% age points), and in triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses (1.2 mm). The PL group showed significant decreases between exams in percent weight for age, percent height for age, percent weight for height, percent arm circumference for age, and skinfold thicknesses for age. The A group had highly significant increases (P less than 0.0002) in all of these parameters except height for age. From Exam 1 to 2, the A group exhibited decreases (P less than 0.0002) in geometric means eggs per gram of feces (epg): for hookworm, means = 1,183 epg at Exam 1 vs. 136 epg at Exam 2 (67% egg reduction); for T. trichiura, means = 2,857 epg at Exam 1 vs. 1,061 epg at Exam 2 (28% egg reduction); and for A. lumbricoides, means = 86 epg at Exam 1 vs. 2 epg at Exam 2 (91% egg reduction). The PL group had a borderline increase in geometric means hookworm egg count, no significant change in T. trichiura egg count, and a small but significant decrease in A. lumbricoides egg count. Decreases in intensities of all infections were significant predictors of growth improvement. Hookworm egg count entered the equations for all 6 measurements, and A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura entered 4/6 equations. Single dose treatment with albendazole, despite continual exposure to infection, can permit improved growth rates in areas where intestinal helminths and protein-energy malnutrition are highly prevalent.\r"

DHF rates of 0.4-6.5 cases per 1,000 residents in subdistricts and 2-15 cases per 1,000 residents in 10 villages investigated were reported. Epidemics peaked in neighboring villages at different times; in June and July, and in August before the rainy season began late in the month. In 4 primary schools representing 6 villages, sera from groups of randomly selected children were tested for dengue IgM with the antibody capture ELISA test. Rates of recent dengue infection were 10-65% in the schools and correlated closely with reported rates of DHF. In an effort to control vectors, malathion fog and temephos (1% abate sand granules) were applied. Villagers were educated in prevention and were urged to cover water receptacles. The percentage of houses with larvae dropped from 67 to 20, the percentage of containers with larvae decreased from 30 to 5, and the number of containers with larvae per 100 households decreased from 221 to 33. This was a serious epidemic in which conventional control measures were only moderately effective.\r"

During thiopental-nitrous oxide-enflurane (end-tidal concentration less than 0.25%) anesthesia, supramaximal stimulation was applied to both the ulnar nerve and the nerve to the masseter. Baseline tension and the isometric force of contraction were measured at the jaw and the thumb. Cumulative dose-response relationships were obtained by giving succinylcholine in incremental doses (initial dose, 0.10 mg/kg, followed by 0.05- or 0.1-mg/kg increments, depending on response). An infusion was started after the maximum effect of the first dose, at a rate adjusted to compensate for the rapid metabolism of the drug. There was no difference between the sensitivity of the masseter and the adductor pollicis. The ED50 values were (mean +/- SEM) 0.11 +/- 0.01 mg/kg at both muscles. The ED90 values were 0.17 +/- 0.02 mg/kg at the masseter and 0.16 +/- 0.01 mg/kg at the adductor pollicis. Onset of action was more rapid at the masseter. In six of the ten patients, baseline tension at the jaw was found to increase by a mean of 80 +/- 24 g (range 25-188 g). It is concluded that in adults, masseter neuromuscular blockade can be achieved with succinylcholine doses approximately equal to those required to block the adductor pollicis. In addition, the drug may cause increased tension in the muscles of the jaw.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the efficacy of the computer-processed electro-encephalogram (EEG) for determining near-awakening from anesthesia, 14 patients were monitored during emergence from either isoflurane or fentanyl anesthesia at the termination of major surgical procedures. The raw EEG was obtained using bilateral frontomastoid electrodes. The compressed spectral array was digitized and recorded on disk in 4-s epochs using a Tractor Northern \"Nomad\" processor. The EEG information was displayed in four formats: 1) the frequency-power spectrum from 1-20 Hz, 2) the 95% power frequency, 3) the 50% power frequency, and 4) the ratio of power in the 8-20 Hz frequency range to the power in the 1-4 Hz frequency range (delta ratio). During emergence from isoflurane, there were obvious changes in the EEG frequency-power spectrum that occurred several minutes before patients opened their eyes in response to verbal stimuli. Although no one descriptor of EEG activity could be shown to be superior in anticipating when patients would respond by opening their eyes, awakening was always presaged by an abrupt decrease in power in the 1-4 Hz frequency range; this resulted in a marked increase in the delta ratio value. During emergence from fentanyl anesthesia, however, there was no obvious change in the overall EEG frequency-power spectrum. However, the same numeric EEG descriptors that were predictive of awakening from isoflurane also occurred during emergence from fentanyl, even though they usually occurred within 1 min of awakening. It is concluded that EEG criteria for identifying when patients will awaken from anesthesia are more reliable with isoflurane than with fentanyl.\r"

The patients were randomly assigned to three different groups: group 1 (N = 10) included patients undergoing lumbar epidural anesthesia without hemodilution; group 2 (N = 10) consisted of patients with normovolemic hemodilution without epidural anesthesia; and in group 3 (N = 10) normovolemic hemodilution was produced during lumbar epidural anesthesia. The three groups included several patients with a history of either myocardial infarction or stable mild angina or treated and controlled hypertension. In group 1, the level of epidural anesthesia reached T-9 +/- 1. After lumbar epidural anesthesia and 7 mL/kg colloid infusion, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased slightly but significantly above baseline, without significant changes either in mean arterial pressure or in cardiac index. In group 2, the same colloid infusion as in group 1 when infused before normovolemic hemodilution increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac index without significant effects on arterial blood pressure. Normovolemic hemodilution using a colloid solution decreased hemoglobin concentration (18%) and increased cardiac index significantly (9%). No significant change in systemic oxygen transport or in total body oxygen consumption was observed. In group 3, with anesthesia to T-9 +/- 1, hemodynamic changes were as observed in group 1. After normovolemic hemodilution, hemoglobin concentration decreased significantly (15%), whereas cardiac index increased significantly (15%) without significant changes either in mean arterial pressure or in heart rate. Systemic oxygen transport and total body oxygen consumption did not change significantly. No patient experienced chest pain or electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, combining ineffective intrathecal doses of morphine (25 micrograms) and clonidine (5 micrograms) produced statistically significant, reversible suppression of noxiously evoked activity. The time course of suppression was similar to that observed behaviorally. These results support the role of spinal alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in clonidine analgesia.\r"

There were no statistically significant differences between tympanic membrane, esophageal, rectal, and axillary temperatures. The temperatures of the peripheral skin surface (forearm and fingertip) were significantly lower than tympanic membrane temperature and significantly different from each other. Although esophageal and tympanic membrane temperatures in the entire group were similar, esophageal temperatures in patients receiving active and passive airway humidification were about 0.35 degrees C above tympanic temperatures after induction of anesthesia. In contrast, esophageal temperatures in patients without airway humidification were 0.25 degrees C below tympanic temperatures after induction of anesthesia. Esophageal-tympanic membrane temperature differences in the patients given active and passive humidification differed significantly from the corresponding sum in the control group at all times, but not from each other.\r"

Breathing 35% O2 for 10 min 10 min after arrival in the RR, as well as 20 min and 1 hr after arrival, significantly increased SaO2 above the SaO2 level after breathing room air by 5.7% (P less than 0.001), 4.3% (P less than 0.001), and 4.0% (P less than 0.001), respectively. A significant multiple correlation was found between low SaO2 levels while breathing room air on arrival in the RR and fentanyl dose, age, and concentration of halothane used intraoperatively (R = 0.46; P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study defines some characteristics of a standard anesthetic circuit that may impede anesthetic induction and recovery with I-653, sevoflurane, isoflurane, and halothane. Partition coefficients for anesthetic circuit components (masks, bellows, bags, airways, and circuit tubes) consistently ranked halothane greater than isoflurane greater than sevoflurane greater than I-653, suggesting a reverse order of washin and washout rates for an anesthetic circuit constructed from similar components. Consistent with this prediction, the concentrations of I-653 increased and decreased more rapidly than those of the other agents at any flow rate during washin (0.5, 1, or 2 L/min gas inflow rates) or washout (1, 3, or 5 L/min) in a conventional anesthetic circuit. The rates of change in I-653 concentration closely approximated the maximal possible theoretical rates. Our results suggest that absorption of I-653 by circuit components or soda lime should not hinder induction of or recovery from anesthesia.\r"

Congenital abnormalities of the clavicle, congenital small thoracic outlet, high first rib, cervical ribs of all configurations, pectoralis minor and pectoralis major syndromes, and others may occur. The costoclavicular syndrome and scalenus anticus syndrome have been considered the most prevalent compression syndromes and are amenable to surgical or medical treatment. Quantitative measurements of the microcirculation of the fingertip were examined with the shoulders and head in various positions to provide quantitative information relative to the costoclavicular and scalenus anticus syndromes. A laser instrument was ideal for this purpose, for results were quantitative and no counterpressure was applied during the measurement. The technic applied was highly successful in separating quantitatively the normal individuals from those with either costoclavicular syndrome or scalenus anticus syndrome.\r"

The treadmill walking distance before the intervention ranged from 24 to 67 m before and 105 to 115 m after the procedure (speed 2 mph; gradient 12.5%). After atherectomy, the walking distance improved by 35% to 126%. No patient in stage II perceived pain. In these patients treadmill exercise was terminated because of dyspnea. The ankle/arm ratio (Doppler ultrasound) ranged from 0.4 to 1.0 before atherectomy with a mean improvement of 0.15 afterward (stages II and IV).

The authors studied the effect of high-cholesterol diets on the genesis of atherosclerosis and lipid peroxidation products, malondialdehyde (MDA) in rabbits. The animals were divided into four groups each comprising 5 rabbits, on the basis of their diets. Group I, control diet; group II, cholesterol; group III, coconut oil; group IV, a mixture of cholesterol, coconut oil, and cholic acid. Rabbits were sacrificed five months after being on the respective diets. Blood samples were obtained for the measurements of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), triglycerides, and MDA at the end of the protocol. The aortas were removed from different animals for the identification of atherosclerotic plaques. Plaques were detected in all the animals in group II and group IV. The serum total cholesterol, LDL-C, and VLDL-C were significantly higher in animals of group II and IV than in those of group I. The values for serum total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and VLDL-C in group III were not significantly different from those in group I.

She had unprovoked further increase in her heart rate up to 145 bpm, and during these episodes, her ECG displayed further ST segment depression up to 3 mm and of 0.12 second duration. An organic cause could not be found to explain her sinus tachycardia. Results of all laboratory investigations, including coronary angiography, were normal. It was observed that during an episode of reflex vagotonia, when her heart rate was below 95 bpm, her previously depressed ST segments became isoelectric. With the thought that this patient's ST segment depression was rate-dependent, carotid sinus massage was performed, and when the heart rate slowed to 95 bpm her depressed ST segments became isoelectric. The same response was accomplished with beta blockers. Sympathetic hyperactivity was thought to be the most likely mechanism of ST segment depression in this patient. A critical increase in heart rate caused these ECG abnormalities.\r"
