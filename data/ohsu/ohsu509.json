  ".W": "Not all patients with cervicopharyngeal pain related to the stylohyoid apparatus can be diagnosed as having Eagle's syndrome. An attempt is therefore made to classify these patients according to etiology. First, a diagnosis of Eagle's syndrome is applied to symptomatic patients in whom elongated, ossified styloid processes develop within a period of time posttraumatically. Second, a diagnosis of stylohyoid syndrome is applied to patients in whom elongated styloid processes and/or stylohyoid chain ossification develop early in life as an anatomic anomaly, and in whom symptoms later develop. Last, a diagnosis of pseudostylohyoid syndrome is applied to patients in whom, because of aging, a tendinosis at the junction of the stylohyoid ligament and the lesser horn of the hyoid bone develops. It is hoped that such a simplified classification may lead to a global understanding of the causes of such symptomatology, a more practical approach to treatment, and less confusion among the professions in regard to terminology.\r"

In an effort to prove that this is also the case in children and adolescents, 150 panoramic radiographs were examined at the Department of Pedodontics of St. Justine's Hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. A total of 300 styloid processes and stylohyoid chains were evaluated and measured radiographically. The patients' mean age was 11 years. The mean length of the styloid processes was 10 mm. Forty percent of the population without symptoms studied showed some evidence of stylohyoid ligament ossification. Sixty percent of these were males; 40% were females. It was also found that 65.6% had no history of cervicopharyngeal trauma on review of the medical and dental histories.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between oral discomfort and menopause was assessed in 149 women who were divided into three groups determined by response to a questionnaire. The groups consisted of 50 premenopausal women (30 to 43 years old), 47 menopausal women not receiving medical treatment for symptoms of menopause (37 to 66 years old), and 52 menopausal women attending a menopause clinic before and during treatment for menopausal symptoms (30 to 63 years old). The last group had a general medical assessment, including psychological and oral examinations with oral smears and cultures, and the following blood tests: full blood examination, follicle-stimulating hormone, oestradiol, folate, vitamin B12, iron, and total iron binding capacity. Of this last group, 33% reported oral discomfort but had no obvious organic abnormalities that could account for this symptom. The prevalence of oral discomfort was found to be significantly higher in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women (43%) than in premenopausal women (6%). The results also showed an association between oral discomfort and psychological symptoms in menopausal women. Approximately two thirds of the menopausal women with oral discomfort, but without oral clinical signs, found that this symptom was relieved after hormone replacement therapy. The results indicated that oral discomfort is a common symptom of menopause, that it often occurs without overt clinical signs, and that it frequently resolves during appropriate hormone replacement therapy.\r"

The amino acid sequence of secreted Er-1 starts at aspartic acid-36 of pre-pro-Er-1 and completely matches that known by direct Er-1 protein sequencing. The coding region of Er-1 cDNA ends with codon TAA, which specifies glutamine in other ciliates. The 5'- and 3'-noncoding regions contain, respectively, two and one inverted repeats. The 3'-noncoding-region inverted repeat, which includes the unusual polyadenylylation signal AACAAA, has been related to RNA 3'-terminus formation.\r"

  ".U": "89240667\r", 
  ".W": "A 70-kDa protein is phosphorylated in cell-free preparations from rat or mouse fibroblasts by an endogenous protein kinase. This protein is immunologically related to a group of 68-kDa to 87-kDa proteins described in the literature as substrates for protein kinase C (PK-C). Although the phosphorylation of the 70-kDa protein by isolated plasma membranes takes place in the presence of EGTA, we conclude that the reaction is catalyzed by PK-C based on its inhibition by staurosporin. As shown previously, pure PK-C phosphorylates a synthetic random polymer of arginine and serine in the absence of Ca2+ and lipids, a reaction markedly stimulated by an endogenous unidentified activator of PK-C. When the 70-kDa protein from normal fibroblasts was exposed to the cytosol of chemically or ras-transformed fibroblasts, it disappeared as measured by phosphorylation by added PK-C. Cytosol of normal fibroblasts was much less effective (ca. 20%). Cathepsin L purified from rat kidney or from the medium of transformed cells had an effect similar to that of the cytosol of transformed cells. When the 70-kDa protein was phosphorylated by PK-C prior to exposure to cathepsin L or to the cytosol of transformed cells, there was a marked protection of the 70-kDa protein. We conclude that the 70-kDa protein is degraded by cathepsin L as ascertained by both immunological and biochemical assays and that it is protected by prior phosphorylation with PK-C. The possible role of this effect in signal transduction is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of gastrin gene transcription was studied in GH4 pituitary cells transfected with constructs comprised of the first exon of the human gastrin gene and various lengths of 5' regulatory sequences ligated upstream of the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Gastrin reporter gene activity in GH4 cells was equal to the activity of a reporter gene transcribed from the endogenously expressed growth hormone promoter. The effect of a variety of peptides on gastrin gene transcription including epidermal growth factor (normally present in the gastric lumen), gastrin-releasing peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and somatostatin (present in gastric nerves) was assessed. Epidermal growth factor increased the rate of gastrin transcription almost 3-fold, whereas thyrotropin-releasing hormone and vasoactive intestinal peptide increased gastrin transcription 2- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Gastrin-releasing peptide, a peptide that strongly stimulates gastrin release, weakly increased gastrin transcription (1.3-fold). Somatostatin inhibited the increase in gastrin transcription induced by epidermal growth factor, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and vasoactive intestinal peptide. Constructs containing various lengths of 5' regulatory sequences defined a response element -40 to -82 base pairs (bp) 5' to the transcription initiation site. This 40-bp sequence contains Sp1 and AP2 binding sites, which suggests that epidermal growth factor and thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulate gastrin gene transcription through transcription factors that bind to Sp1 and/or AP2 motifs.\r"

  ".U": "89240671\r", 
  ".W": "The nature and rate of reduction of Hg2+ to Hg0 by 1,5-dihydro-3,(3-sulfopropyl)lumiflavin (FIH2) in buffered aqueous solutions (pH 4.7) is dependent on the ligation of Hg2+. In the presence of N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine or when ligated to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, the reduction is first order in Hg2+ and FIH2. The apparent second-order rate constant with N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine (2.2 x 10(6) M-1.s-1) is much greater than that in the presence of ligating ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (1.5 x 10(2) M-1.s-1). When ligated by mercaptoethanesulfonate, reduction of Hg2+ by FIH2 is characterized by a pronounced lag phase, which is dependent on the concentration of mercaptoethanesulfonate. The rate decreases with increase in mercaptoethanesulfonate, and with an excess of 10 equivalents, Hg2+ is not reduced by FIH2. These observations show that bis-ligation by thiolate greatly decreases the reducibility of Hg2+ and that further ligation by thiolate further retards the reaction. Comparison of oxidation-reduction potentials at various pH values shows that bis-ligation (or greater) of Hg2+ by thiolate substantially lowers the reduction potential of Hg2+ below that of 3(3-sulfopropyl)lumiflavin (FIox). Thus, the ease of reduction of Hg2+ complexes by FIH2 decreases with increasing thermodynamic stability of the complex. These results do not support the proposed role of the thiol functionalities in facilitating the mercury(II) reductase (Hg:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.16.1.1)-catalyzed reduction of Hg2+ through tris- or tetraligation of Hg2+.\r"

  ".W": "After retroviral infection of a permissive cell, the viral RNA is reverse-transcribed to make a DNA copy of the viral genome. Integration of this DNA copy into the host genome is a necessary step for efficient viral replication. We have developed a cell-free system for integration of exogenous mini-retroviral DNA. The termini of this linear mini-Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) DNA are designed to mimic the ends of authentic unintegrated MoMLV DNA. The viral proteins required for integration can be provided either as a cytoplasmic extract of MoMLV-infected NIH 3T3 cells or as disrupted MoMLV particles. Phage lambda DNA serves as the target for integration. Genetic markers present on the mini-MoMLV DNA enable integration events to be detected, and the recombinants recovered, by selection in Escherichia coli. Integration, which occurs at heterogeneous locations in the target DNA, is absolutely dependent on the presence of a source of viral proteins and a divalent cation in the reaction mixture. The fidelity of the integration reaction was confirmed by sequencing the junctions between the integrated MoMLV DNA and adjacent lambda DNA sequence. In each case, as expected for authentic MoMLV DNA integration, a 4-base-pair duplication of target DNA sequence flanked the integrated MoMLV DNA.\r"

  ".U": "89240678\r", 
  ".W": "The enzymatic ADP-ribosyltransferase activity associated with the S1 subunit of pertussis toxin is considered to be responsible for its biological effects. Although pertussis toxin has no significant homology to other ADP-ribosylating toxins such as diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, the results presented in this paper show that, as for diphtheria toxin and exotoxin A, tryptophan and glutamic acid residues are essential for the enzymatic activities of pertussis toxin. Moreover, a structural motif can be identified around the critical glutamic acid residue. Chemical modification or site-directed deletion or replacement of Trp-26 abolishes ADP-ribosyltransferase and the associated NAD glycohydrolase activities. Both enzymatic activities are also abolished when Glu-129 is deleted or replaced by aspartic acid. Mutations at the Glu-106 position do not significantly reduce the enzymatic activities of the S1 subunit. The mutations do not affect the ability of the different S1 forms to be recognized by a variety of monoclonal antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies. Pertussis toxin containing a deletion or replacement of Trp-26, Glu-129, or both in the S1 subunit should thus be devoid of toxic activities without losing its reactivity with protective antibodies and, therefore, could be safely included in new generation vaccines against whooping cough.\r"

In one topological condition of the substrate, the absolutely relaxed state, cleavage was found to be impeded. This finding defines the topology-dependent step of the eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I reaction and shows that for the cleavage reaction topology is more critical than sequence effects. These findings suggest a simple model for the regulation of the DNA topoisomerase I reaction based on topological factors, which may explain the regulatory function of the enzyme in in vivo eukaryotic transcription.\r"

Alone, calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha terminates in vitro DNA synthesis upon insertion of noncomplementary nucleotides. Upon addition of the epsilon subunit, DNA polymerase alpha elongates the newly synthesized DNA as a result of hydrolysis of the 3'-terminal mispair. The fidelity of DNA polymerase alpha in vitro is increased 7-fold by addition of the exonuclease. The functional interaction between DNA polymerase alpha and the epsilon subunit is independent of any detectable physical association. This suggests that a mechanism for proofreading could exist in mammalian cells involving sequential catalysis by DNA polymerase alpha excision of errors by a separate 3'----5' exonuclease, and further elongation onto correctly base-paired 3' termini by DNA polymerase alpha.\r"

The zeta subspecies of protein kinase C consists of 592 amino acid residues with the calculated molecular mass of 67,740 Da and has regulatory and protein kinase domains in its amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves, respectively. Although all members of the protein kinase C family so far identified have a tandem repeat of the characteristic cysteine-rich zinc-finger-like sequence in the regulatory domain, the zeta subspecies contains only one set of this sequence. Northern (RNA)-blot hybridization analysis indicated that two major RNA transcripts of the zeta subspecies with different lengths may be generated by the use of different polyadenylylational signals. The enzyme was expressed in COS-7 cells by transfection with the cDNA construct encoding its whole sequence. It showed an approximate molecular mass of 64,000 Da upon SDS/PAGE. The enzyme activity was significantly dependent on phospholipid but was independent of the presence of Ca2+ or diacylglycerol, when assayed with calf thymus H1 histone as a phosphate acceptor protein. The zeta subspecies expressed in COS-7 cells did not appear to show binding activity of phorbol ester. The structural and biochemical properties indicate that the zeta subspecies is related to, but distinct from, other subspecies of protein kinase C. Perhaps, this subspecies belongs to another entity of the enzyme family.\r"

  ".U": "89240693\r", 
  ".W": "The transcription factor GAL4 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a \"zinc-finger\"-like motif, Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa6-Cys-Xaa6-Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa6+ ++-Cys, within its DNA-binding domain. A GAL4 fragment consisting of residues 1-147 plus two additional residues from the cloning vector [denoted GAL4(149*)] has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. This fragment includes the entire DNA-binding domain (residues 1-74). The homogeneous GAL4-(149*) protein contains 1-1.5 moles of Zn(II) per mole of protein. The GAL4(149*) protein binds tightly to the specific 17-base-pair palindromic DNA sequence found at GAL4 binding sites as shown by gel-retention assays using a 32P-labeled 23-mer containing this sequence. Removal of the intrinsic Zn(II) by EDTA at low pH abolishes binding to the 23-mer. The GAL4(149*) apoprotein can be reconstituted with Zn(II), Cd(II), or Co(II) with restoration of specific DNA binding. Titration of GAL4(149*) apoprotein with 113Cd(II) shows two 113Cd(II) binding sites on the molecule, one with delta of 707 ppm, suggesting coordination to four sulfur atoms, and one with delta of 669 ppm, suggesting coordination to three or four sulfur atoms. Because GAL4(149*) protein contains only six cysteine residues within its DNA-binding domain, the precise coordination of the two Cd(II) ions cannot be stated with certainty; one or more shared -S- ligands could exist. GAL4(149*) protein contains approximately 40% alpha-helix and approximately 20% beta-sheet, estimated from circular dichroism. Removal of the native Zn(II) ion causes limited unfolding of secondary structure, but less than one turn of alpha-helix. The binding of Zn(II), Cd(II), and, to a lesser extent, Co(II) to GAL4(149*) apoprotein protects the protein from proteolysis by trypsin, which produces a 13-kDa DNA-binding core.\r"

  ".W": "Heparin is a complex glycosaminoglycan that inhibits the proliferation of several cell types in culture and in vivo. To begin to define the mechanism(s) by which heparin exerts its antiproliferative effects, we asked whether heparin interferes with the expression of the growth factor-inducible protooncogenes c-fos and c-myc. We show that heparin suppressed the induction of c-fos and c-myc mRNA by serum in murine (BALB/c) 3T3 fibroblasts. Using purified mitogens, we further show that suppression was most marked when protooncogene expression was induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C. By contrast, there was little or no suppression when the cells were stimulated by epidermal growth factor, which, in these cells, utilizes a protein kinase C-independent pathway for the induction of gene expression. Heparin also inhibited the change in cell morphology induced by the phorbol ester but had no effect on the morphological change induced by epidermal growth factor and agents that raise intracellular cAMP. Heparin did not inhibit intracellular protein kinase C activity, phorbol ester-induced down-regulation of protein kinase C, or phosphorylation of the 80-kDa intracellular protein kinase C substrate. These results suggest that heparin inhibits a protein kinase C-dependent pathway for cell proliferation and suppresses the induction of c-fos and c-myc mRNA at a site distal to activation of the kinase.\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged exposure of quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells to vasopressin prevents mitogenic stimulation on subsequent addition of bombesin. This heterologous desensitization is selective and can be mimicked by vasopressin agonists, including [Lys8]vasopressin and oxytocin but not by the V1-type-specific vasopressin receptor antagonist [Pmp1,O-Me-Tyr2,Arg8]vasopressin [where Pmp is 1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopenthamethylene propionic acid)]. Furthermore, vasopressin-induced loss of responsiveness to bombesin can be blocked by addition of this antagonist, indicating that heterologous desensitization is mediated through the vasopressin receptor. Desensitization requires prolonged incubation (half-maximal desensitization occurring after approximately 20 hr of pretreatment) and continuous protein synthesis. Bombesin responsiveness is restored by incubation in the absence of vasopressin. Pretreatment does not alter the number, affinity, or internalization capacity of the bombesin receptors. However, the induction of the protooncogene c-fos by bombesin is profoundly inhibited after vasopressin pretreatment. We suggest that the coupling of the activated bombesin receptor to the generation of its early signals is impaired in desensitized cells.\r"

The protein product of that gene (endonuclease V) was detected in extracts of heat-shocked transformants with both enzymological and immunoblotting procedures. That protein restores both excision repair and UV resistance to mei-9 and mus201 mutants of this organism. These results reveal that the denV gene can compensate for excision-repair defects in two very different eukaryotic mutants, in that the mus201 mutants are typical of excision-deficient mutants in other organisms, whereas the mei-9 mutants exhibit a broad pleiotropism that includes a strong meiotic deficiency. This study permits an extension of the molecular analysis of DNA repair to the germ line of higher eukaryotes. It also provides a model system for future investigations of other well-characterized microbial repair genes on DNA damage in the germ line of this metazoan organism.\r"

Thus, it has generally been assumed that all ciliates use a nonuniversal genetic code in which TGA acts as the sole termination codon. We have sequenced the linear DNA molecules that carry an actin gene and a beta-tubulin gene from the ciliate Euplotes crassus. These genes are shown to use TAA as a termination codon based on homology to known actin and beta-tubulin gene sequences. In addition, we have sequenced a portion of the 3' terminus of the E. crassus H4 histone gene and show that it also uses TAA as a termination codon. These data indicate that the timing of genetic code changes in the ciliates must be reconsidered.\r"

  ".U": "89240716\r", 
  ".W": "Many mammalian receptors have been found to regulate cell growth by virtue of a protein-tyrosine kinase domain in their cytoplasmic tail. We recently described an association of the CD4 antigen with a T-cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (p56lck; formerly termed pp58lck; EC 2.7.1.112). This interaction represents a potential mechanism by which T-cell growth may be regulated and offers a model by which other members of the src family (products of c-src, c-yes, c-fgr, etc.) may interact with mammalian growth factor receptors. As in the case of the CD4 antigen, the CD8 antigen appears to serve as a receptor for nonpolymorphic regions of products of the major histocompatibility complex and has been implicated in the regulation of T-cell growth. In this study, we reveal that the human CD8 antigen is also associated with the T-cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (p56lck). The associated p56lck kinase was detected by use of both in vitro and in vivo labeling regimes using an antiserum to the C terminus of p56lck. Two-dimensional nonequilibrium pH-gradient gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated the similarity of p56lck to the protein-tyrosine kinase associated with the CD4 antigen. The catalytic activity of p56lck was revealed by the autophosphorylation of the 55- to 60-kDa kinase and the occasional labeling of a 35-kDa protein. Last, we demonstrate directly that members of the CD3 complex, including the gamma, delta, and epsilon chains, as well as a putative zeta subunit, can be phosphorylated at tyrosine residues by the CD4/CD8.p56lck complex.\r"

This association occurs when the T-cell receptor is cross-linked by certain anti-variable region antibodies that appear to induce a conformational change in the receptor such that it associate with CD4. Similar association has been observed in earlier studies with the same cloned helper T cell when the physiological ligand, antigen-class II major histocompatibility complex molecule, is bound by the T-cell receptor. The ability of anti-T-cell receptor antibodies to induce the T-cell receptor-CD4 association correlates with a 100-fold increase in the ability of the antibody to activate the T cell. This suggests that the complex of CD4 and the T-cell receptor act synergistically in T-cell activation, thus readily explaining the commonly observed association of CD4 expression with class II major histocompatibility complex-restricted antigen recognition. This association could also play a role in infection by human immunodeficiency virus.\r"

  ".W": "We have found a defect in the ouabain-sensitive Na+, K+-ATPase (Na+ pump, EC 3.6.1.37) of erythrocytes from streptozocin diabetic rats. This defect was accompanied by an increase in cell volume and osmotic fragility and a decrease in the cytosolic K+/Na+ ratio. There was also a doubling in the time needed for diabetic erythrocytes to pass through 4.7-micron channels in a polycarbonate filter. Our data are consistent with a primary defect in the erythrocyte Na+ pump and secondary changes in cell volume, osmotic fragility, K+/Na+ ratio, and cell filterability. All were reversed or prevented in vivo by insulin or the aldose reductase inhibitor Sorbinil. Protein kinase C agonists (phorbol ester and diacylglycerol) and agonist precursor (myoinositol) reversed the Na+ pump lesion, suggesting that protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of the 100-kDa subunit regulates Na+ pump activity and that insulin can influence erythrocyte protein kinase C activity. Ouabain inhibition of the erythrocyte Na+ pump also produced increases in cell size and reductions in rates of filtration. Theoretical treatment of the volume changes also predicts reduction in filterability as a consequence of cell swelling. We suggest that enlarged erythrocytes could play a role in the evolution of the microvascular changes of diabetes mellitus.\r"

A second phase of lymphokine gene expression occurs in the majority of 15-day thymocytes, and a population of cells constitutively produces both IL-2 and IL-4 mRNAs. Thymocytes at 14 days of gestation and after 16 days up until birth do not express detectable lymphokine mRNA. By contrast, the population of IL-2 receptor mRNA-producing thymocytes increases progressively up to 15 days of gestation, and expression thereafter decreases up to birth. In addition, thymocytes expressing interferon gamma mRNA were not present until just prior to birth. Our findings indicate developmental control of lymphokine and lymphokine receptor gene expression in fetal thymocytes during ontogeny.\r"

  ".W": "To understand the role of sickle cell adherence to the vascular endothelium in the pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia (SS) vasoocclusion, we have carried out a microcirculatory study utilizing the ex vivo mesocecum vasculature of the rat. A single bolus of washed oxy-normal (AA) erythrocytes or oxy-SS cells (unseparated or density-defined SS cell classes) was infused. Hemodynamic monitoring and intravital microscopic observations of the microvascular flow revealed higher peripheral resistance for SS erythrocytes and adherence of these cells exclusively to the venular endothelium but rare or no adherence of AA cells. The extent of adhesion was inversely correlated with venular diameters (r = -0.812; P less than 0.00001). The adhesion of SS erythrocytes is density-class dependent: reticulocytes and young discocytes (SS1) greater than discocytes (SS2) greater than irreversible sickle cells and unsicklable dense discocytes (SS4). Selective secondary trapping of SS4 (dense cells) is found in postcapillary venules where deformable SS cells are preferentially adhered. We conclude that in the oxygenated condition, vasoocclusion can be induced by two events: (i) random precapillary obstruction by a small number of SS4 cells; (ii) increased adhesion of SS1 and SS2 cells in the immediate postcapillary venules. A combination of precapillary obstruction, adhesion in postcapillary venules, and secondary trapping of dense cells may induce local hypoxia, increased polymerization of hemoglobin S, and rigidity of SS erythrocytes, thereby extending obstruction to nearby vessels.\r"

Previously, we observed that HSV infection causes a 40-fold increase in cholesteryl ester (CE) accretion in arterial smooth muscle cells due, in part, to a substantial decrease in CE hydrolysis. In studies reported herein, we found that HSV infection leads to reduced immunoprecipitable lysosomal (acid) CE hydrolase (ACEH) and beta-galactosidase, another lysosomal enzyme in vascular smooth muscle cells. The HSV-induced reduction was greater with respect to ACEH than beta-galactosidase. To determine whether degradation of host cellular mRNA or inhibition of cellular translation was responsible for decreased CE hydrolysis in HSV-infected smooth muscle cells, we utilized an in vitro translation system that permitted us to compensate for any mRNA degradation during viral infection. Reduced ACEH activity was observed in the total cellular RNA translation products of HSV-infected smooth muscle cells compared to uninfected cells owing to posttranscriptional modification. We conclude that the decrease in CE hydrolysis in HSV-infected smooth muscle cells is caused primarily by decreased ACEH synthesis and activity, which can contribute to CE accretion in these vascular cells.\r"

The acute, in situ muscle protein response to an infusion of methionyl human growth hormone was investigated in the limbs of nutritionally depleted subjects during a period of intravenous refeeding. A 6-hr methionyl growth hormone infusion achieved steady-state serum levels comparable to normal physiologic peaks and was associated with a significant increase in limb amino acid uptake, without a change in body amino acid oxidation. Myosin heavy-chain mRNA levels, measured by quantitative dot blot hybridization, were also significantly elevated after growth hormone administration. The data indicate that methionyl growth hormone can induce intracellular amino acid accrual and increased levels of myofibrillar protein mRNA during hospitalized nutritional support and suggest growth hormone to be a potential therapy of lean body wasting.\r"

L-NMMA (3-100 mg.kg-1), but not its D-enantiomer, induced a dose-dependent long-lasting (15-90 min) increase in mean systemic arterial blood pressure. L-NMMA (100 mg.kg-1) also inhibited significantly the hypotensive action of acetylcholine, without affecting that of glyceryl trinitrate. Both these actions of L-NMMA were reversed by L-arginine (300 mg.kg-1), but not by D-arginine (300 mg.kg-1), indomethacin (1 mg.kg-1), prazosin (0.3 mg.kg-1), or by vagotomy. The effects of L-NMMA in vivo were associated with a significant inhibition of the release of nitric oxide from perfused aortic segments ex vivo. This inhibition was reversed by infusing L-arginine through the aortic segments. These results indicate that nitric oxide formation from L-arginine by the vascular endothelium plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure and in the hypotensive actions of acetylcholine.\r"

In MOLT-3 cells chronically infected with HIV-1 (strain HTLV-IIIB), tunicamycin severely inhibited the glycosylation of envelope proteins. Deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of glucosidase I in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, inhibited the proteolytic processing of gp160, whereas no such effect was noted with either deoxymannojirimycin or swainsonine, inhibitors of mannosidase I and II, respectively, in the Golgi complex. The processed gp120 and gp41 synthesized in the presence of deoxymannojirimycin were found to contain mannose-rich oligosaccharide cores as evidenced by their susceptibility to endoglycosidase H digestion. The formation of syncytia normally observed when CEM cells are cocultured with HIV-1-infected cells was markedly inhibited in the presence of deoxynojirimycin, but such inhibition was not observed in cells treated with deoxymannojirimycin or swainsonine. The infectivity of virions released from MOLT-3/HTLV-IIIB cells treated with deoxynojirimycin or deoxymannojirimycin was significantly lower than the infectivity of virions released from untreated cells. On the other hand, treatment with swainsonine did not affect the infectivity of the progeny virus. These results suggest that the proteolytic processing of gp160 takes place in infected cells when the glycoprotein has mannose-rich oligosaccharide structures. Trimming of glucose residues and the primary trimming of mannose residues are necessary for the release of infectious virus.\r"

However, incubation of the endothelial monolayers with AP-III (10(-8)-10(-6) M) antagonized thrombin-induced (1 unit/ml) cell-shape change and the formation of intercellular gaps. AP-III also opposed the effect of thrombin on the distribution of actin filaments in the endothelial cytoskeleton. Further, thrombin caused a 2-fold increase in monolayer permeability to 125I-labeled albumin, which was abolished by 10(-8)-10(-6) M AP-III pretreatment. Taken together with the findings that AP-III exhibited specific and saturable binding in these cells, these data suggest that AP regulates endothelial permeability through a receptor-mediated process.\r"

  ".W": "Simultaneous patch-clamp and fura-2 measurements were used to investigate the electrical properties and receptor-mediated changes of intracellular calcium in renal juxtaglomerular cells. Here we report the presence of voltage-activated inward and outward rectifying potassium currents and the inhibition of the anomalous inward rectifying potassium current by angiotensin II (ANG-II). This action of ANG-II was mimicked by guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate but not by cAMP, cGMP, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, or phorbol ester, suggesting that ANG-II inhibits the potassium channel directly by means of a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein or by means of an unusual type of second messenger. Blocking of the inward rectifier was paralleled by membrane depolarization, but we obtained no evidence for calcium entry due to voltage-gated calcium channels in juxtaglomerular cells. Instead, under voltage clamp, ANG-II and guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate induced release of calcium from intracellular stores followed by a sustained phase of transmembrane calcium influx and oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were found to depend on the extracellular Ca concentration--i.e., the sustained elevation was abolished in absence of extracellular Ca, and the frequency of repetitive calcium release was directly related to the extracellular concentration of calcium. Moreover, an elevation of extracellular Ca concentration by itself induced release of intracellular calcium in the absence of other stimuli. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were accompanied by prominent calcium-activated chloride currents, and this mechanism is inferred to be responsible for the inhibitory role of calcium in renin secretion. Intracellular application of cAMP but no cGMP inhibited ANG-II and guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate induced calcium mobilization in juxtaglomerular cells, being consistent with the facilitatory effects of elevated cAMP levels of renin release. The frequency of ANG-II induced oscillations was also markedly attenuated at depolarized membrane potentials suggesting effective negative feedback control of ANG-II-induced depolarization on repetitive Ca2+ transients induced by the hormone.\r"

  ".W": "Human recombinant lipocortin 1 has been tested for anti-inflammatory activity in a conventional model of acute inflammation. Microgram amounts of the protein, locally administered, inhibited edema of the rat paw when induced by subplantar injections of carrageenin: the ED50 was 10-20 micrograms per paw, and inhibition (maximum of 60-70%) was not dependent upon an intact adrenal cortex. Doses of lipocortin that produced approximately 50% inhibition in the carrageenin test were inactive against edema elicited by bradykinin, serotonin, platelet-activating factor-acether, or dextran, whereas edema caused by Naja mocambique venom phospholipase A2 was strongly inhibited by lipocortin. The protein inhibited edema when rats were pretreated with agents that depleted mast-cell amines, kininogen, or polymorphonuclear leukocytes prior to initiation of the carrageenin edema but had no inhibitory action when rats were pretreated with the dual cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor BW 755C. These results demonstrate that human recombinant lipocortin has potent local anti-inflammatory activity, probably through selectively interfering with eicosanoid generation. Lipocortin is relatively ineffective against edema caused by mast-cell degranulation or kinins, except when degranulation is caused by phospholipase A2.\r"

Mutation of a kappa B core sequence identified in the IL-2 promoter (-206 to -195) partially inhibits both mitogen- and HTLV-I Tax-mediated activation of this transcription unit and blocks the specific binding of two inducible cellular factors. These kappa B-specific proteins (80 to 90 and 50 to 55 kilodaltons) similarly interact with the functional kappa B enhancer present in the IL-2R alpha promoter. These data suggest that these kappa B-specific proteins have a role in the coordinate regulation of this growth factor-growth factor receptor gene system that controls T cell proliferation.\r"

Embryonic stem cells containing the lacZ constructs were used to produce chimaeric mice. Developmental regulation of lacZ expression occurred at a high frequency. Molecular cloning of the flanking endogenous genes and introduction of these potential insertional mutations into the mouse germ line should provide an efficient means of identifying and mutating novel genes important for the control of mammalian development.\r"

This site, which is bound by the nuclear protein, NF-kappa B, is critical for Ig kappa gene expression. The major T cell nuclear factor that binds to the IL-2R alpha site in vitro appears indistinguishable from NF-kappa B. NF-kappa B binds to IL-2R alpha and kappa sequences with similar affinities; however, only the kappa site potently activates transcription from heterologous promoters. Thus, high-affinity NF-kappa B binding in vitro cannot be equated with transcriptional activation in vivo. Mutation of the NF-kappa B binding site in the context of an IL-2 R alpha promoter construct markedly diminished promoter activity in human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-transformed MT-2 cells but not in phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated Jurkat T cells.\r"

Addition of IFN-gamma to murine macrophages, at activating concentrations, produced rapid (within 60 seconds) alkalinization of the cytosol and a concomitant, rapid influx of 22Na+. Amiloride inhibited the ion fluxes and the accumulation of specific messenger RNA for two genes induced by IFN-gamma (the early gene JE and the beta chain of the class II major histocompatibility complex gene I-A). The data indicate that IFN-gamma initiates rapid exchange of Na+ and H+ by means of the Na+/H+ antiporter and that these amiloride-sensitive ion fluxes are important to some of the genomic effects of IFN-gamma.\r"

Clonal genetic variants of mouse epidermal JB6 cells that are genetically susceptible (P+) or resistant (P-) to promotion of transformation by TPA were transfected with 3XTRE-CAT, a construct that has AP-1 cis-enhancer sequences attached to a reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Transfected JB6 P+, but not P- variants, showed TPA-inducible CAT synthesis. Epidermal growth factor, another transformation promoter in JB6 cells, also caused P+ specific induction of CAT gene expression.

Therefore, the role of gamma delta T cells in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) was investigated. The number of TCR gamma delta cells in the draining lymph nodes of mice immunized with MT was greatly increased in comparison with the number of TCR alpha beta cells. Three biochemically distinct gamma delta TCRs were detected. Analyses of cell cycle, of interleukin-2 receptor expression, and of interleukin-2 responsiveness showed that a large proportion of the gamma delta T cells were activated in vivo. TCR gamma delta cells responded to solubilized MT antigens in vitro but, in contrast to MT-specific alpha beta T cells, the response of gamma delta T cells to MT did not require major histocompatability complex class II recognition. These results provide an example of antigen-specific activation of gamma delta T cells in vivo and indicate that gamma delta T cells may have a distinct role in generating a primary immune response to certain microorganisms.\r"

The amounts of DnDP leaked into the plasma of PCs were low at 0.58 +/- 0.06 mg per bag after 5-day storage, which is about one-eightieth the amount of DEHP leaked. The pH of PCs in PVC-DnDP bags amounted to 6.99 +/- 0.03 after 5-day storage, with glycolysis accelerated somewhat in the new bags. However, the platelet oxygen consumption was no different from that in the PVC-DEHP bags. Platelet aggregation and responses to hypotonic shock were significantly better in the new bags at the end of storage. Shape changes of platelets into spherical forms with dendrites were more frequently observed in PVC-DnDP bags than in PVC-DEHP bags. The study indicated that platelets stored in the new DnDP-plasticized PVC bags have retained aggregation and responses to hypotonic shock more than platelets in the PVC-DEHP bags, but spherical forms and anaerobic metabolism increased in the new bags.\r"

In the first part of the study, 196 medical records of patients from medical and surgical diagnosis-related groups with the highest utilization of blood (Group I) were screened. Forty patients were excluded because of a preexisting transfusion protocol.

Thirty-five patients (22%) received fresh-frozen plasma transfusions, of which 69 percent were indicated, 11 percent not indicated, 17 percent controversial, and 6 percent indeterminate. In the second part of the study, medical records were screened from 99 randomly selected patients who had received red cell transfusions (Group II), and the results were similar to those in Group I.

Simultaneous donation is technically feasible and safe for donors, and it provides functional products that are more cost-effective than apheresis platelets or cryoprecipitate donated separately.\r"

Further investigation using the hemagglutination (HA) test with red cells coated with IgA myeloma proteins of different specificities showed that the serum agglutinated only IgA2-, A2M-1, and A2M 2-coated cells. The patterns of the HAI test with a reference panel confirmed the presence of two specificities. One was anti-IgA2 and the other was a rare antibody against the allotype A2M 2. The anti-A2M 2 was used for population studies. Testing of the Han Chinese population, including family studies, confirms that A2M.1 and A2M.2 have an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and are controlled by a codominant allele. The distribution of the two Am genetic markers among the Han Chinese population demonstrated A2M.1 with a gene frequency of 0.553 and A2M.2 with a gene frequency of 0.447 (chi 2 = 0.145, 0.80 greater than p greater than 0.70).\r"

Forty-six patients were entered into this study, and were matched by defined criteria. The results of the study demonstrated a six-day difference in hospital stay for the CPS group (p less than 0.05). Length of aminoglycoside therapy was 33 hours shorter for the CPS group. Additionally, the time necessary for resolution of the infection was significantly shorter for this group, as assessed by vital signs returning to normal or baseline. Three patients in each group expired. Two patients in the CPS group and five in the control group developed aminoglycoside-associated increases in serum creatinine. No significant difference was found between the two groups in age, weight, or APACHE II score. Additionally, the two groups were similar with respect to concomitant diseases and concomitant antibiotics used. The approximate cost of the CPS was calculated as $56 per patient. Use of the CPS decreasing hospital stay by six days (mean $1875/patient) would translate to an annual savings of $654,375 in hospital charges, assuming 365 patients received aminoglycoside therapy per year.\r"

Tests were performed under static and turbulent conditions of incubation, with and without antibiotics added to the fluids, and with or without 1% citrated blood. All solutions were inoculated with about 1000 organisms/mL, and sampled for viable bacteria at specific time intervals. Under static conditions, there was no significant decrease in viability (p greater than 0.01) of the bacilli, except for the staphylococci (p less than 0.01). However, when cultures were agitated, all species showed significant decline in viability (p less than 0.01). When antibiotics were present, S. aureus (beta-lac+) declined gradually throughout 24 hours (p greater than 0.01). B. cereus (beta-lac+) concentrations were static in all solutions. All organisms multiplied rapidly in solutions containing blood. The results suggest that the growth characteristics of both beta-lac+ and beta-lac- bacteria in intravenous fluids are essentially similar, except in solutions containing beta-lactamase-sensitive antibiotics in which beta-lac+ bacteria tend to survive.\r"

Mean total serum cholesterol and mean total serum phospholipids increased in parallel throughout the study; density gradient ultracentrifugation demonstrated these increases were due to the appearance of lipoprotein-X. The mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) mass on the density gradients decreased during the study and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels decreased by 28% by the end of the third week. Plasma free fatty acids decreased by 42%. These results demonstrate that the glucose and 10% Intralipid regimen caused modest decreases in serum HDL cholesterol and LDL mass and the prompt appearance of lipoprotein-X with attendant hypercholesterolemia and hyperphospholipidemia. Patients undergoing long-term treatment with glucose and Intralipid should be closely monitored for the occurrence of significant dyslipoproteinemia.\r"

Similarly, the 2-wk relative protein-efficiency ratio values (64-85%) or the relative net protein ratio values (78-94%) of liquid concentrates were up to 25% lower than those for powders. Lower levels of bioavailable lysine and methionine plus cystine in liquid concentrates compared with powders (prepared by the same manufacturer) would suggest that inferior protein quality of liquid concentrates may be due to more heat treatment involved in their preparation.\r"

  ".W": "Lactase-deficient subjects absorb lactose in yogurt more effectively than lactose in other dairy products. However, as all previous studies were performed without a double-blind design and only after a single ingestion of the test product, the mechanism of this enhanced absorption remains unclear. The aims of this double-blind study were 1) to evaluate lactose absorption after prolonged ingestion of yogurt and fermented-then-pasteurized milk (FPM) and 2) to assess the modification of the lactase activity of the duodenal mucosa. In 16 lactase-deficient subjects we confirmed that yogurt enhances lactose digestion, this beneficial effect being destroyed by pasteurization. Moreover, the long-term (8 d) ingestion of either yogurt or FPM does not modify the results of hydrogen breath tests in comparison with a 24-h ingestion. The mucosal lactase (Dahlquist method) and beta-galactosidase (ONPG method) activities were not significantly modified by yogurt or FPM ingestion. These results suggest that in lactase-deficient subjects no adaptation occurs after eating yogurt or FPM and that the increased lactose absorption in yogurt must be mainly related to an intraluminal process.\r"

In duodenal samples taken after fresh yogurt ingestion, viable starter culture was detected for 60 min in 6 of 7 subjects and the ratio of microbial beta-galactosidase activity to SBS remained similar during this period to its value in the preingested yogurt. In the two groups ingesting fresh and heated yogurt respectively, ratios of lactose to PEG remained similar to preingested values for 90 min and duodenal pH remained less than 5.1. In vitro, at pH 5.0, beta-galactosidase activity in yogurt dropped by 80%. These data clearly show that after fresh yogurt ingestion, viable starter culture reaches the duodenum and contains beta-galactosidase activity. However, the buffering capacity of the yogurt that protects bacteria from acidic gastric secretion also prevents microbial beta-galactosidase from hydrolyzing lactose in the duodenum.\r"

In the nonhyperinsulinemic men total triglycerides, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and uric acid were significantly greater after the consumption of fructose than after cornstarch.

Mean 24-h Zn and Cu balances were positive in infants with diarrhea and negative in postoperative infants. The high Zn and Cu content in the gastrointestinal fluid loss associated with surgery may have accounted in part for this finding. Normal serum levels of Zn and Cu did not guarantee positive balance. No significant changes were found in serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, or ceruloplasmin.

Besides histiocytic lesions, AAT immunoreactivity was commonly found in different types of carcinomas and sarcomas, and strong immunoreactivity was found in carcinoid tumors, malignant melanomas, and schwannomas, which, however, had negative results for lysozyme. The AAT immunoreactivity could be abolished with the absorption of the antibody with purified AAT also in nonhistiocytic tumors. The neoplastic pleomorphic cells in malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs) usually had strongly positive results for AAT, whereas only entrapped histocytes had positive results for lysozyme and for two monoclonal antibodies to histomonocytic cells. The results show that AAT has a relatively low specificity as a histiocytic marker, and one should be careful in concluding the histiocytic nature of tumors, such as MFHs, based on AAT immunostaining. It seems also questionable whether AAT can be used as a diagnostic marker for MFH. The reason for the widespread AAT immunoreactivity in various tumors may be that AAT is taken up from serum to various types of nonhistiocytic tumor cells.\r"

Because there was no significant difference between the distribution of the ML kappa/lambda ratios for which kappa/lambda greater than 1 compared with those ML lambda/kappa ratios for which lambda/kappa greater than 1 using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, the authors treated kappa/lambda and lambda/kappa data symmetrically. By transforming all kappa/lambda ratios to maximum ratios, that is, Rmax = max (kappa/lambda, lambda/kappa), so that all resulting ratios were at least one, the authors defined a new statistic for evaluating sIg light chain restriction. There was a highly significant difference for equality of distribution of the data using the Mann-Whitney test (P less than 0.0001). By choosing cut-points based on the Rmax statistic, the authors were able to separate the RFH and ML cases with sensitivity = 0.96 +/- 0.07 (95% confidence) and with specificity = 0.91 +/- 0.11 (95% confidence). These point estimates of sensitivity and specificity appear to be promising for the clinical utility of the Rmax statistic, even for cases of B-cell ML with discordantly low expression of sIg light chains. The Rmax statistic will facilitate the comparison of data between different laboratories because it does not require prior assignment of cut-points and can be made using a simple nonparametric test.\r"

All time intervals were monitored, including receptionist, secretarial, nursing, phlebotomy, etc., and costs for all materials, procedures, and labor were calculated. The total cost per test by the capillary whole blood prothrombin time method was significantly less than by standard prothrombin time methods ($7.55 vs. $15.64) even though the nurse-patient encounter time was greater per test for the capillary method (12.4 minutes vs. 8.3 minutes). The management of oral anticoagulation guided by prothrombin times performed on instrumentation designed to sample capillary whole blood should result in a significant cost savings, and because of the immediate availability of results, provide the potential for improved health care.\r"

Patients of lower socioeconomic status may be underreimbursed by DRGs. We analyzed pediatric patients and hospital resource consumption by race (white, Hispanic, and black) using a DRG prospective payment \"all payer\" system. All hospitalized pediatric admissions over a 3-year period (N = 14,489) were analyzed by race at a large academic medical center. Mean hospital length of stay and cost per patient (adjusted for DRG weight index) was significantly greater for black and Hispanic pediatric patients compared with whites. Financial risk as measured by outliers and losses under DRGs was greater for blacks and Hispanics compared with whites. Black and Hispanic patients had a higher proportion of emergency admission to the hospital compared with whites, a greater severity of illness (as measured by total International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, Clinical Modification codes), and (on average) higher diagnostic costs for each episode of illness. Our data suggest that black and Hispanic pediatric patients have a greater hospital resource consumption (adjusted for DRG group case mix) compared with whites, at least at our large medical center in the Northeast. Hospitals that treat greater numbers of black and Hispanic pediatric patients may be at a substantial disadvantage under per-case DRG payment.\r"

Clinical studies revealed a tumor-like overgrowth in the gastric wall, and surgery confirmed its subserosal localization in the gastric fundus. After total removal of the mass, the systemic manifestations disappeared. The pathological study revealed the existence of the hyaline-vascular variety of Castleman's disease. Having reviewed the medical literature, we have not found a single unquestionable case of gastric Castleman's disease, although three other cases have been described as gastric pseudolymphoma which, when analyzed, could correspond to typical cases of Castleman's disease. Likewise, this is the second case associated with a circulating anticoagulant of lupoid characteristics. We conclude that Castleman's disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of gastric lesions of lymphoid nature and in the series of processes associated with lupus anticoagulant.\r"

We studied prospectively the hepatitis B virus antigen and antibody status and liver functions in 63 uremic patients admitted consecutively to our dialysis program. Nineteen percent of uremic patients, negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B virus surface antibody (anti-HBs), hepatitis B virus DNA, and antibody to delta agents, had anti-HBc in their sera at the time of admission to maintenance dialysis. This prevalence was significantly higher than that of the medical personnel working in the dialysis unit (P = 0.043) and healthy controls (P = 0.027). The prevalence of persistent presence of isolated anti-HBc increased to 31% in these uremic patients on long-term maintenance dialysis. Four patients had developed anti-HBc alone during their course of maintenance dialysis, and the appearance of anti-HBc was preceded by blood transfusion within 4 to 8 weeks. Transient or recurrent hepatic dysfunction occurred in three of these four patients. Patients with isolated anti-HBc were characterized by a higher incidence of repeated liver dysfunction (P less than 0.005), elevated alanine transaminase levels (P less than 0.005), and a higher transfusion requirement (P less than 0.01). Our data strongly suggest that these patients with isolated anti-HBc may have acquired either hepatitis B virus infection or non-A, non-B hepatitis through repeated blood transfusions despite careful screening of the donated blood to exclude transmission of hepatitis B virus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Whether or not an increased serum level of an unmeasured cation will reduce the anion gap (AG) depends on concomitant changes (or lack thereof) in serum unmeasured anions. In the present retrospective study, we sought to determine the effect of lithium carbonate or citrate and magnesium sulfate on the AG. Two groups of psychiatric patients whose average serum lithium levels were 0.6 and 1.0 mEq/L were studied. The AG in each group (10.2 +/- 0.3 [SE] and 9.0 +/- 0.4 mEq/L, respectively) was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than that of a control group (11.1 +/- 0.3 mEq/L). Separately, we collected 87 pairs of AG and serum magnesium data of patients with toxemia of pregnancy. These included those of 15 patients evaluated both before and during magnesium sulfate infusion. Despite an average serum magnesium level of 4.1 +/- 0.2 mEq/L, the AG of the latter subjects tended to increase slightly from 10.8 +/- 0.5 to 11.7 +/- 0.7 mEq/L during magnesium infusion, instead of decreasing. The other data (72 determinations in the 55 patients without preinfusion values) revealed a mean AG of 11.0 +/- 0.3 mEq/L, coexisting with an elevated serum magnesium of 4.1 +/- 0.1 mEq/L. None of the above-mentioned three mean AG values differed significantly from that of the control group. We conclude that hypermagnesemia resulting from the administration of magnesium sulfate does not reduce the AG, probably because of a concomitant and proportional increase in serum sulfate. The present data reemphasize the need to assess the anion gap as the result of concomitant changes in both unmeasured anions and cations.\r"

Chronic renal failure patients are known to have elevated levels of circulating natriuretic activity and also to have detectable DLIS. Using digoxin radioimmunoassay, DLIS levels were measured in desalted, deproteinized plasma from 15 stable hemodialysis patients. Predialysis DLIS was 109.3 +/- 6.3 pg/mL (digoxin equivalents) and decreased to 97.5 +/- 5.9 pg/mL following dialysis (P less than 0.001). Predialysis DLIS correlated with weight gain from the prior dialysis (P less than 0.01). The degree of extracellular fluid volume expansion predialysis also correlated with predialysis DLIS (P less than 0.01). Postdialysis DLIS also correlated with postdialysis extracellular fluid volume status (P less than 0.01). DLIS levels in dialysis patients were higher than in 50 normal subjects (30.0 +/- 1.2 pg/mL; P less than 0.001). Also, the changes in DLIS with dialysis were paralleled by similar changes in simultaneously measured human alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels. These results demonstrate that (1) DLIS levels are higher in hemodialysis patients than in normal individuals; (2) with dialysis, DLIS levels increase and decrease in association with extracellular fluid volume expansion and removal, respectively; (3) DLIS levels correlate with the degree of extracellular fluid volume expansion in dialysis patients; and (4) DLIS levels change in parallel with levels of another class of natriuretic factor ANP. These characteristics are consistent with the hypothesis that DLIS represents a volume-sensitive factor.\r"

An important mechanism of inter-individual variation is the first pass through the enterohepatic circulation. When drugs such as ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone undergo this process, part of an orally administered dose is inactivated, which results in wide ranges of bioavailability. In connection with this process, these drugs are also susceptible to various drug-to-drug interactions. Levonorgestrel is not subject to first-pass extraction by the liver, which results in virtually 100% bioavailability. It is unclear whether interpopulation variations in blood levels result from ethnic, geographic, nutritional, or other phenomena. Hepatic mechanisms are qualitatively different as demonstrated by striking differences in urinary patterns of ethinyl estradiol conjugates and hydroxylations of ethinyl estradiol from country to country.\r"

Serum levonorgestrel levels were significantly lower in the 2.5 cm group. Ovulation occurred in all cycles in the 2.5 cm group and in 26.3% of cycles in the 4.0 cm group. Levonorgestrel levels with the shorter capsule were too low for reliable contraception in all users, and 4 cm may be a minimal functional length. Bleeding patterns were regular in most women who ovulated and irregular in most remaining subjects. It is assumed that changes in cervical mucus and the endometrium contributed to effective contraception despite the frequency of ovulation.\r"

  ".U": "89244885\r", 
  ".W": "Rats with extensive renal mass reduction develop hypertension, proteinuria and progressive glomerulosclerosis. Previous studies have demonstrated that these changes are associated with an increased urinary excretion of thromboxane compared with normal rats and that the administration of a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor prevents glomerulosclerosis and progressive renal function deterioration. On this basis it has been speculated that the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, by inhibiting platelet thromboxane, reduces platelet aggregation and prevents the generation of substances that can influence glomerular functional properties. Because the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor also inhibits thromboxane synthesis by resident glomerular cells and lowers blood pressure in these animals, the question of whether platelet thromboxane is indeed the factor implicated in the development of renal disease after renal ablation remains unanswered. To address this issue the authors administered at different time intervals from the surgical procedure a low-dose of oral aspirin (ASA) to rats with remnant kidney. This approach resulted in selective inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase leading to an almost complete prevention of platelet thromboxane generation. Low-dose ASA spared renal cyclooxygenase as documented by a lack of significant inhibition of glomerular and urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and did not lower blood pressure. Renal function studies showed that low-dose ASA, despite inhibiting platelet aggregation, had no effect on proteinuria and progressive renal insufficiency irrespectively if administered late (ie, 80 days after surgery) and given daily for all the observation period (ie, 20 days) or earlier in the course of the disease (ie, 40 and 10 days after surgery). Histologic data showed that the degree of glomerulosclerosis and tubulo-interstitial damage was not significantly different in rats with reduction of renal mass alone compared with rats with remnant kidney given low-dose ASA. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that inhibition of platelet aggregation and thromboxane formation does not prevent the progressive glomerulosclerosis that develops in rats with surgical reduction of renal mass. It is suggested that the beneficial results obtained previously in the same model by the use of a thromboxane synthesis inhibitor must be attributed either to an effect on resident glomerular cell thromboxane synthesis or to lowering systemic blood pressure.\r"

The expression of the defect was independent of an underlying heart disease and was observed both in normal hearts and in hearts with hypertrophy and/or coronary arteriosclerosis. In contrast, age was a discriminating factor: The defects occurred sporadically in the second decade, but were regularly present from the sixth decade on. Also, the number of defects/sq cm (defect density) increased with age from 2 to 3 in the second and third decade, to about 50 defects in advanced age. Irrespective of the defect density, the enzyme defect always affected isolated cardiomyocytes and ended abruptly at the intercalated disc of neighboring heart muscle cells, as revealed by ultracytochemistry. The results indicate that cytochrome-c-oxidase deficient heart muscle cells represent a degenerative lesion associated with cellular ageing and may be involved in the reduction of myocardial contractile ability in senescence.\r"

The effects of cholestatic hepatic disease and chronic renal failure on the pharmacokinetics of alfentanil were evaluated in 9 children undergoing liver transplantation and 10 children undergoing kidney transplantation. These findings were compared with data from 10 children with normal hepatic and renal function undergoing other surgical procedures. There was no statistical difference among the 3 groups with respect to apparent volume of distribution, half-life, or clearance. In a subgroup of 3 patients undergoing liver transplantation alfentanil kinetics were determined both before and after the allograft was incorporated into the recipient's circulation. Though both volume of distribution and elimination half-life increased in the posttransplantation period, only the decrease in clearance was statistically significant. Thus, it appears that alfentanil may be a useful anesthetic agent in pediatric patients with cholestatic hepatic disease or chronic renal failure. The dose of alfentanil in these patients need not be altered except in the period immediately after liver transplantation.\r"

The purpose of this study was to compare the onset and duration of epidural analgesia with the use of sodium bicarbonate and tromethamine to increase the pH of 2% chloroprocaine (2CP). Five groups of patients were studied: Group I received 2CP; Group II received 2CP buffered to a pH of 7.1 with tromethamine; Group III received 2CP buffered to a pH of 7.1 with sodium bicarbonate; Group IV received 2CP buffered to a pH of 7.7 with tromethamine; and Group V received 2CP buffered to a pH of 7.7 with sodium bicarbonate. The final pH and PCO2 of each solution were measured. Time to onset of analgesia was significantly delayed with either of the tromethamine buffered groups (II [5.6 +/- 1.0 minutes] and IV [5.4 +/- 0.4 minutes]) when compared with data from the unbuffered control (I [4.4 +/- 0.1 minutes]) and the sodium bicarbonate buffered (III [4.5 +/- 0.8 minutes] groups and Group V [2.7 +/- 0.9 minutes]). Only when sodium bicarbonate buffer adjusted to pH 7.7 (Group IV) was onset significantly more rapid than the unbuffered 2CP (I) and tromethamine buffered 2CP (II and IV). Multiple regression analysis revealed that onset times were significantly related to both pH and PCO2. The coefficient of determination for this model was 0.5156.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study determined the time course of the ventilatory changes observed during the first hour of recovery from isoflurane anesthesia. Ten patients (ASA PS 1) scheduled for minor orthopedic surgery (knee arthroscopy) were included in this study. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental (5 mg/kg) and maintained with 70% N2O and isoflurane (1-2%) in oxygen, allowing spontaneous ventilation. In the recovery room, after N2O had been discontinued, patients were connected to a Beckman Metabolic measurement cart, which allowed a continuous monitoring of VE, VO2, VCO2, and PETCO2. Postoperative tremor was observed in all patients within 7.1 +/- 1.2 min (mean +/- SEM) after isoflurane discontinuation and was associated with a marked increase in the following: VO2, from 173 +/- 26 ml/min at the end of anesthesia to 457 +/- 88 ml/min; VCO2, from 149 +/- 18 ml/min at the end of anesthesia to 573 +/- 98 ml/min; and VE, from 6.8 +/- 0.7 l/min at the end of anesthesia to 16.6 +/- 2.8 l/min (values obtained 20 min after isoflurane discontinuation). In three patients during intense shivering, VO2, VCO2, and VE reached peak values higher than 800 ml/min, 1,300 ml/min and 30 l/min, respectively. This study shows that postoperative tremor following isoflurane anesthesia may be associated with prolonged and large increases in oxygen uptake, CO2 output, and minute ventilation.\r"

These agonists are known to affect the interaction of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) with its receptor. Because the action of volatile anesthetic agents may be mediated by GABA, the authors determined the MAC of isoflurane in 16 dogs before and after one of three doses of intravenous flumazenil (0.15, 0.3, and 0.45 mg/kg) or the drug vehicle. The flumazenil produced a reduction in MAC from 1.39 +/- 0.15% (mean +/- SD) to 1.23 +/- 0.11% after 0.15 mg/kg (P less than 0.05), from 1.50 +/- 0.35% to 1.08 +/- 0.20% after 0.3 mg/kg (P less than 0.01), and from 1.45 +/- 0.14% to 1.09 +/- 0.08% after 0.45 mg/kg (P less than 0.01). Administration of drug vehicle produced no change in MAC. This reduction in isoflurane requirement by flumazenil may be due to its benzodiazepine receptor agonist action or its analgesic effect.\r"

Dogs were initially anesthetized with thiopental (12 mg/kg, iv bolus), their tracheae intubated, after which anesthesia was maintained with 1.4% isoflurane. In eight animals three levels of PaCO2 (25, 40, and 60 mmHg) were studied during 1.4% and 2.8% isoflurane. Mean arterial blood pressure, sagittal sinus pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid pressure were measured and CBF was determined using radiolabeled microspheres. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was maintained constant at approximately 80 mmHg by inflation of a balloon in the midthoracic aorta. CBF during normocapnia was 70 +/- 14 and 118 +/- 18 ml.min-1.100 g-1 with 1.4% and 2.8% isoflurane, respectively. As PaCO2 was decreased and increased, CBF decreased and increased to 42 +/- 7% and 185 +/- 16% of control, respectively, during 1.4% isoflurane. During 2.8% isoflurane, hypocapnia decreased CBF to 39 +/- 6% of control, but CBF did not increase with hypercapnia. In a second group of animals (n = 8), the effects of changes in CPP during hypercapnia with 1.4% and 2.8% isoflurane were assessed. Increasing CPP approximately 25 mmHg with both 1.4% and 2.8% isoflurane increased CBF but did not change CVR from control. With 1.4% isoflurane, the cerebral vasculature constricts with hypocapnia and dilates with hypercapnia, whereas with 2.8% isoflurane, vasoconstriction to hypocapnia is retained but vasodilation to hypercapnia is absent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, only general guidelines have been available regarding the need for blood gas analysis during an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We conducted a study to determine the relationship between arterial blood gases and spirometry in 70 emergency department patients during acute exacerbations of COPD. Arterial blood gas analysis and spirometry were performed on arrival at the emergency department. All of the patients with a pCO2 of more than 45 mm Hg had an FEV1 of less than 35% of the predicted normal. We found patients with a pO2 of less than 60 mm Hg who had an FEV1 as high as 54% of the predicted normal. There was no correlation between the FEV1 and pO2. Because spirometry was not reliable for identifying patients with significant hypoxemia, we conclude that arterial blood gas analysis is indicated for patients presenting to the ED with acute exacerbations of COPD. Spirometric criteria that have been used to eliminate the need for arterial blood gases in asthmatic patients cannot be applied safely to patients with COPD.\r"

The hemodynamic mechanism of action and the effect of TRH on the respiratory system during anaphylactic shock are not known. A rabbit model of anaphylaxis was used to determine the effect of TRH, epinephrine (EPI), and normal saline (NS) on various cardiovascular and respiratory parameters during anaphylactic shock. Anaphylactic shock was induced by antigen challenge in 31 sensitized animals. After a 25% decrease in mean arterial pressure, they were randomly treated with TRH (2 mg/kg), EPI (0.005 mg/kg), or NS (10 mL/kg). Blood was drawn at baseline and at the end of the experiment for laboratory analysis. Cardiac and respiratory parameters were monitored continuously and measured at baseline, at onset of shock (time zero), and at time intervals for 30 minutes. Animals were treated with repeated doses during the first 15 minutes as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure above shock level. Five of ten TRH-, five of 11 EPI-, and six of ten NS-treated animals survived. The TRH-treated group required fewer doses than the other groups and had increased heart rate, mean arterial pressure, peripheral vascular resistance, respiratory rate, and minute ventilation as well as decreased stroke volume index and lung compliance compared with the NS-treated group. EPI treatment resulted in increased minute ventilation and decreased pulmonary airway resistance compared with NS treatment. The EPI group also had a higher postsurvival epinephrine level than the other groups. No difference in right atrial pressure, cardiac index, acid-base status, pO2, A- a gradient, lung weight, lactate, or norepinephrine levels was found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors' bias has been to attempt PEG on nearly all patients referred to gastrostomy tube prior to performing open gastrostomy. In this light, we reviewed our 32 month experience of 115 PEG placements in 112 adult patients, with a mean follow-up of 59.4 days. Placement was unsuccessful in ten per cent of patients and difficult in another six per cent. Minor postoperative complications not requiring intervention occurred in 9.5 per cent of patients, and major complications in 20 per cent. Infection was the most common postoperative problem. Thirty day mortality was 24 per cent. No patient died as a direct result of the procedure. The ten per cent failure rate is a consequence of attempting PEG as the initial procedure in greater than 90 per cent of patients. PEG can be employed as an initial procedure in even the sickest of patients with a high rate of success, and morbidity comparable to open gastrostomy. This knowledge allows early PEG placement in all types of patients, thereby facilitating their transfer to a non-acute care environment.\r"

The reappearance of retraction corresponded in speed to the diffusion coefficient of the gases, indicating a regular diffusion process. At the same time, four of these politzerized patients were able to collapse the tympanic membrane of their air-filled middle ears abruptly through sniffing or swallowing. At least three patients could introduce air actively and voluntarily into their ears. These observations indicate that in atelectatic ears, as in normal ears, air can enter and leave the middle ear through one of two routes. One is the eustachian tube, through which air can pass both ways as a bolus. The second route is through the bloodstream, which gases enter and leave according to the rules of biologic diffusion. While the origin of negative pressure in atelectatic ears is unknown, this study shows that it may be a complex process stemming from a quantitative imbalance of loss versus gain of gas entry through either of the two routes.\r"

Although otologic symptoms have been described in these patients, to our knowledge there have been no temporal bone histopathologic reports. We describe the clinical histories, audiometric results, and temporal bone findings of two patients with this rare disorder. Both patients demonstrated a bilateral sloping sensorineural hearing loss audiometrically. Middle ear findings of seropurulent effusions and hyperplastic mucosa were seen in all four temporal bones. Strial and spiral ligament atrophy in all turns, and hair cell loss mainly in the basal turns, were also common findings. The number of spiral ganglion cells was reduced in all temporal bones; however, evidence of glycosphingolipid accumulation was not observed in the spiral ganglia.\r"

The permeability coefficient for Na+ of the cochlear partition in the NMO-treated animals significantly decreased, while that for Cl- significantly increased. The negative EP, which presumably exists in the normal state, diminished further (-2.7 mV versus -27.8 mV), and the calculated electrogenic potential of the EP was depressed remarkably (33.5 mV versus 110.2 mV). The results suggest that the effects of NMO involved changes in ion permeabilities of the partition and the inhibition of electrogenic transport processes in the cochlea.\r"

The transport of mupirocin into sensitive bacteria was energy independent and temperature dependent (decreased uptake at lower temperatures), indicating non-carrier-mediated passive diffusion. Uptake was also saturable with time or increasing antibiotic concentration. The saturable intracellular binding site, most likely the target isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase as determined by the amount of bound mupirocin (2,700 to 3,100 molecules per cell), caused concentration of the antibiotic within the cell. E. coli transformed with a plasmid containing ileS overproduced the target enzyme and demonstrated greater accumulation of mupirocin than a strain containing a control plasmid. The concentrations needed to half saturate (Kd) these binding sites in B. subtilis and S. aureus were 35 and 7 nM, respectively. In gram-positive organisms trained for mupirocin resistance, uptake was not saturable with increasing antibiotic concentration, and intra- and extracellular concentrations of drug equilibrated with time. Kinetic analysis of crude isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase from trained and untrained B. subtilis strains revealed differences in apparent Ki for mupirocin (resistant strain SB23T, Ki = 71.1 nM; sensitive strain SB23, Ki = 33.5 nM), while the Km for isoleucine remained unchanged (2.7 to 2.9 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A strain of Enterococcus faecalis (A256) was isolated from the urine of a patient with urinary sepsis and was found to exhibit susceptibilities (micrograms per milliliter) to various glycopeptides as follows: vancomycin, 256; teicoplanin, 16; 62208, 512; 62211, 4; and 62476, 16. As judged by growth rates before and after exposure to sub-MICs of glycopeptides, vancomycin and 62476 induced self-resistance, 62208 and 62211 induced slight self-resistance, and teicoplanin did not induce self-resistance. Vancomycin induced cross-resistance to all other glycopeptides tested, as judged both in growth experiments and by direct measurement of inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in cells exposed to sub-MICs of vancomycin. Thus, the spectra of activity of the glycopeptides were not correlated with their patterns of induction. There was a correlation between the increased synthesis of a 39-kilodalton (kDa) protein located in the cytoplasmic membrane and the induction of resistance. Protoplasts of A256 were susceptible to inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis by vancomycin at levels similar to those for susceptible strains. Vancomycin resistance was transferable on filters from the parent strain to E. faecalis JH2-2 at a frequency of about 10(-7), and the 39-kDa protein was also inducible by glycopeptides in these transconjugants. We conclude that A256 is resistant to glycopeptides by virtue of the synthesis of a 39-kDa cytoplasmic membrane protein, that this protein is probably involved in preventing access of the glycopeptides to their peptidoglycan targets, and that this resistance is transferable, probably by conjugation.\r"

There were no significant differences in the rate of catheter colonization or catheter-related sepsis comparing single-lumen with triple-lumen catheters. However, the use of total parenteral nutrition or insertion at the femoral vein site significantly increased the rate of colonization. The only factor that was clearly associated with catheter sepsis was the duration of catheterization. Catheter sepsis increased from 1.5% to 10% when the period of catheterization exceeded 6 days. We conclude that the use of triple- and single-lumen central venous catheters in critically ill patients entails similar risks of infection.\r"

To determine if care provided to HMO and fee-for-service patient is different once they are hospitalized, we compared length of stay, total costs, and severity of illness for 617 HMO and fee-for-service patients hospitalized during the period 1983 through 1985 at a major teaching hospital. Severity was gauged in the following two ways: the Severity of Illness Index developed by Horn, and ratings by two physicians who were given all records from the first day of each patient's hospitalization. Length of stay was shorter and total costs were less for HMO patients in 7 of 11 diagnosis related groups. Using regression analysis to adjust for age, sex, emergency ward admission, diagnosis related group, and severity, we found that overall length of stay was 14% shorter for HMO patients than for fee-for-service patients (6.2 vs 5.3 days, P less than .01), whereas total costs were only 4% less ($4251 vs $4090, P greater than .2). These findings indicate that while patterns of utilization may vary by diagnosis related groups, HMO patients had shorter lengths of stay but comparable overall costs. Whether shorter lengths of stay represent greater efficiency, substitution of outpatient for inpatient care, or diminution in the quality of care is not clear.\r"

One third of these patients have moderate to severe HO that adversely affects function or health. Pharmacologic prophylaxis of HO for all SCI patients continues to be controversial. High-risk criteria for HO formation identified in total hip replacement patients are not applicable to SCI. A review of the literature did not reveal specific risk factors for HO with SCI. The charts of 100 randomly selected SCI patients, 50 with HO and 50 without HO, were reviewed retrospectively to learn if criteria which would predict high-risk patients could be identified. A total of 14 variables, seven demographic (age, sex, race, level of lesion, completeness of lesion, cause of injury, and geographic locus of patient) and seven medical (bladder stones, fractures, pressure sores, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, spasticity, and urinary tract infections) were studied. Four of the 14 variables (age, completeness of lesion, presence of pressure sores, and spasticity) were significantly related to HO formation. The risk factors appear to be additive. When all were present, 92% of patients were found to have HO. Before the findings are applied clinically, it is suggested that a prospective study be conducted to confirm the risk predictive value of these factors in HO.\r"

We hypothesized that the carbon dioxide (CO2) laser would reduce these complications because of its cauterizing action and high absorption in water. The CO2 laser was compared with a conventional technique of using a penetrating diathermy electrode to drain subretinal fluid in rabbits with experimentally detached retinas. No hemorrhage occurred in 223 drainage trials using the CO2 laser, whereas hemorrhage occurred in 21 (4.8%) of 434 trials using the penetrating diathermy electrode. Furthermore, a depth of saline of only 45 microns protected the retina from perforation at CO2 laser dose adequate for drainage. These results indicate that further evaluation of the CO2 laser in treating human retinal detachment is warranted.\r"

  ".U": "89247164\r", 
  ".W": "A total of six amino acid sequences encoded in conserved regions of the HIV-env (three from gp120 and three from gp41) were selected as potential antigenic domains. These sequences (11-20 amino acids) were fused to the NH2 terminus of beta-galactosidase by recombinant DNA techniques, and the purified chimeric proteins were used to titer (by immunodots) 75 sera from HIV-infected individuals of various stages. All the HIV antigens were recognized by some or all the HIV-seropositive sera but by none of the control sera. Of the three conserved domains in gp41, two are highly immunodominant. All (100%) HIV-seropositive sera reacted with one of these immunodominant domains in titers (approximately 1:100,000) almost two orders of magnitude higher than any other tested domain. This emphasizes the diagnostic value of the epitopes (ERYLKDQLLGIWGCSGKLIC) previously (see Refs. 11 and 12) identified in this domain. A decrease in average antibody titers is observed in late stages of infection for all the antigens tested, yet distribution of antibody reactivity was independent of stage for only three of the six domains. A significantly higher proportion of reactivity of seropositive sera in early stage (62%) compared with late stage (11%) of infection was found for a domain (NVTENFNMWKN) mapped at the NH2 terminus of gp120; serum antibody reactivity with this domain also correlated with a lack of culturable HIV in blood mononuclear cells.\r"

Analyses were accomplished by indirect immunofluorescence labeling with each of 10 monoclonal antibodies and evaluation by flow cytometry. Of the antibodies examined, those specific for HIV-1 capsid protein p24, matrix protein p17, or their precursor molecule p55 allowed the earliest and most sensitive detection in infected cells fixed to allow detection of intracellular antigen. Discrimination of infected cells from uninfected cells was much less sensitive when three antibodies specific for HIV-1 glycoproteins were used to detect intracellular or cell surface antigen. In several experiments involving the time course of infection, we observed no differences in cell numbers between infected and uninfected H9 cultures initiated at identical cell concentrations. We hypothesized that it might be possible to quantitate infectious HIV-1 virions from the kinetics of infected cell appearance. Straight-line relationships between the log p24-positive cells and the time after infection were observed. These quantitative observations were employed to calculate the number of infectious units originally added to the culture that were capable of infecting H9 cells. The production of infectious virus, but not of cytopathic effects, was required. The results of this novel approach to the titration of infectious HIV-1 particles agreed well with those from median cell culture infective dose determination. This method could be employed with other infectious agents for which detection of cell-associated antigens is possible in cell cultures not destroyed by infection.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective study of subgroup of patients from cohort followed up till the end of 1986. SETTING--Outpatient clinic for children with urinary tract infections. PATIENTS--51 Girls aged under 15 with untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria. INTERVENTIONS--Before 1982 intercurrent infections (mostly tonsillitis or otitis) were treated with phenoxymethylpenicillin; after 1982 erythromycin treatment was preferred. END POINTS--Change of bacterial strain in urinary tract and symptomatic recurrences of disease. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Bacteria identified by serotype and electrophoretic type and compared before and after antibiotic treatment. Bacteriuria eradicated and replaced by new strains in most patients treated with phenoxymethylpenicillin, leading to symptomatic recurrences in about 15%. Conversely, patients given erythromycin rarely showed change in bacteriuria and none suffered symptomatic recurrence. CONCLUSIONS--In girls with untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria the use of phenoxymethylpenicillin for intercurrent infections may lead to a change of urinary bacteria and leave them at substantial risk of acute pyelonephritis. With erythromycin this risk is small (2/20 courses in this series).\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether patients referring themselves to an accident and emergency department for another opinion after consulting their general practitioner present with serious illness, show any risk factors for being admitted, or are more likely to be patients of particular practitioners. DESIGN--Six month prospective survey. SETTING--District general hospital's accident and emergency department, receiving 42,000 new patients a year. PATIENTS--180 Patients identified as attending for another opinion having already consulted a general practitioner. INTERVENTIONS--Classified as admission, referral to specialist clinic, follow up in accident and emergency department, or referral back to general practitioner. END POINT--Admission, with an analysis of admitted patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--General outcome, diagnostic category, age, time of attendance, time since seen by general practitioner, and name of general practitioner were recorded. Forty seven patients were admitted, 99 were discharged back to the general practitioner (62 without a letter), and two died. Patients were most likely to be admitted if they attended within 24 hours after seeing a general practitioner, were aged under 5, or presented with respiratory or gastrointestinal complaints. Some general practitioners were overrepresented. CONCLUSIONS--Important disorders present in this way, and therefore these patients should be seen by a doctor. Information about these attendances could be useful to general practitioners in reviewing their performance.\r"

Virus stock (100 microliters) or 10,000 cultured C8166 T lymphocytes infected with HIV were dried onto sterile coverslips and immersed in 2% and 1% alkaline glutaraldehyde and 70% ethanol for 30 seconds and one, two, four, and 10 minutes, there being an additional time point of 20 minutes for cell free virus disinfected with 70% industrial methylated spirit. In addition, virus stock in neat serum was tested with 1% and 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde to see whether the fixative properties of glutaraldehyde impair its virucidal properties. Virus activity after disinfection was tested by incubating the coverslips (cell associated virus) or the coverslips and sonicated cell free virus with C8166 T lymphocytes. The lymphocytes were examined for the formation of syncytia and HIV antigens were assayed in the culture fluid. Both 2% and 1% alkaline glutaraldehyde inactivated cell free HIV within one minute; 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde also inactivated cell free virus in serum within two minutes, but a 1% solution was ineffective after 15 minutes' immersion. Cell associated HIV was inactivated by 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde within two minutes. Seventy per cent industrial methylated spirit failed to inactivate cell free and cell associated HIV within 20 and 15 minutes, respectively, and 70% ethanol did not inactivate cell free virus within 10 minutes. Seventy per cent industrial methylated spirit and ethanol are not suitable for surface disinfection of HIV. Fresh 2% solutions of alkaline glutaraldehyde are effective, but care should be taken that they are not too dilute or have not become stale when used for disinfecting HIV associated with organic matter.\r"

Although using such methods of transport may result in faster access to health care centres, their ultimate role for the civilian population is unclear. Unfortunately, there are many problems associated with aeromedical transport, particularly with rotary wing aircraft, which have shown an alarming tendency to crash. The use of lighter than air vehicles (blimps, hot air balloons) might offer most of the advantages of conventional aieromedical transport, with an appreciable improvement in safety.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine whether a booklet given to patients being discharged from hospital giving details of their admission and treatment increased their knowledge and recall when reviewed in outpatient clinics. DESIGN--Patients alternately allocated to receive a booklet or to serve as controls. Assessment by a questionnaire at first attendance at outpatient clinic after discharge. Data were collected over nine months. SETTING--One general medical and cardiological ward in a large teaching hospital and associated outpatient clinics. PATIENTS--One hundred and thirty one patients discharged taking at least one drug and scheduled to return to clinic within 12 weeks. Patients stratified by age and by the number of weeks between discharge and outpatient appointment. INTERVENTION--A booklet was given to 65 patients at discharge from the ward; 66 patients served as controls. MAIN RESULTS--Of the patients who received the booklet, 56 (86%) knew the names of their drugs, 62 (95%) the frequency of the dose, and 55 (85%) the reasons for taking each drug. The numbers in the control group were 31 (47%), 38 (58%), and 28 (42%) respectively. These differences were highly significant (p less than 0.001). Twenty six (40%) who received the booklet brought all their drugs to clinic compared with 12 (18%) control patients. Appreciably more of the first group of patients than control patients knew the reason they had been in hospital, and more of the first group indicated that they would take the correct action when their prescribed drugs ran out. Most general practitioners thought that the booklet was a good idea, that it was helpful, and that it was better than the existing interim discharge letter. CONCLUSIONS--Giving patients an information booklet at discharge from hospital appreciably increased the accuracy and thoroughness of their recall of important medical details concerning their illness and its treatment. The booklet was shown to be feasible, helpful in the outpatient clinic, and preferred by most general practitioners.\r"

DESIGN--Review study of case notes of consecutive patients examined by the procedure over three years (January 1984 to December 1986). SETTING--Outpatient referrals in a regional cardiac centre within a district general hospital. PATIENTS--Nine hundred patients aged 18-76 (mean 54) selected at a previous clinic as suitable for the procedure. MAIN RESULTS--Eight hundred and fifty patients (94.4%) were discharged home on the day of the procedure. Forty others (4.4%) could not be discharged owing to complications during or just after the procedure. Of these patients, two died (0.2%), six suffered a myocardial infarction (0.7%), and two had major vascular complications. The remaining 30 patients were admitted because of chest pain without infarction (10 cases), minor vascular incidents (six), haemorrhage at the puncture site (five), arrhythmia (four), pulmonary oedema (three), and contrast reaction (two). Ten patients were admitted for either urgent coronary artery bypass grafting or social reasons. CONCLUSIONS--Cardiac catheterisation is safe as an outpatient procedure in most cases. Beds are spared and roughly 35,000 pounds is saved for every 500 procedures performed.\r"

Specimens were taken within a week, between one and three weeks, between four and six weeks, and more than six weeks after grafting. Only two of the 27 biopsy specimens contained cells that were the same sex as the donor; both were taken within a week after grafting. In the 25 other specimens the epithelial cells were the same sex as the recipient. Cultured skin allografts showed no evidence of survival in patients with burns, which suggests that they are probably not suitable for long term management of burns but may be useful as short term biological dressings.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the survival of cultured allogeneic keratinocytes transplanted to a deep dermal bed 24 tattoos that had been removed by deep shave excision in 19 patients were grafted with sheets of cultured allogeneic keratinocytes from donors of the opposite sex. Cells carrying the Y chromosome were identified in biopsy specimens taken from the graft site by in situ DNA hybridisation with a biotinylated Y probe (pHY 2.1) and visualised with a technique using immunoperoxidase. The cultured allograft sites were biopsied one, two, and three weeks after transplantation. No male cells were identified in any biopsy specimen from female patients who were given transplants of male cultured keratinocytes, and all biopsy specimens from male patients, who received female cultured keratinocytes, showed percentages of male cells within the normal range for male skin. The beneficial effects of cultivated allogeneic keratinocytes result from effects on wound healing other than forming a successful graft that \"takes.\"\r"

Seven thousand men (yielding 653 deaths from coronary heart disease, 630 new cases of cancer, and 463 deaths from cancer) and 8262 women (322 deaths from coronary heart disease, 554 new cases of cancer, and 395 deaths from cancer) were examined initially in 1972-6 and followed up for an average of 12 years. All cause mortality was not related to plasma cholesterol concentration. This was largely a consequence of a positive relation between cholesterol values and mortality from coronary heart disease being balanced by inverse relations between cholesterol and cancer and between cholesterol and other causes of death. These changes were highly significant for coronary heart disease and cancer in men and significant for coronary heart disease and other causes of death in women. The inverse association between cholesterol concentration and cancer in men was strongest for lung cancer, was not merely a function of the age at which a subject died, was present for the incidence of cancer as well as mortality from cancer, and persisted when new cases or deaths occurring within the first four years of follow up were excluded from the analysis.\r"

  ".U": "89248044\r", 
  ".W": "Postmenopausal osteoporosis is an important public health problem in developed countries. Preventive treatment might effect a large reduction in the incidence, but this needs to be applied selectively to those women at increased risk. Loss of bone density results in an increased risk of fractures in the classical sites of vertebrae and proximal femur. A cross sectional study of bone density measurements was carried out in these sites in British women with a modern, precise densitometric technique. Possible predictors and risk factors for bone density were assessed in these women. Bone density was measured by dual photon absorptiometry in 284 apparently healthy women volunteers aged 21 to 68. The values obtained were similar to those obtained from equivalent studies performed in women in the United States. Peak adult bone density had been attained soon after the end of linear skeletal growth. Thereafter there was some decline with age in the proximal femur, but the major fall in bone density in all sites was related to the menopause. Other factors decreasing bone density, and hence increasing risk for osteoporosis, such as low body weight, alcohol and cigarette consumption, nulliparity, lack of previous use of oral contraceptives, and lack of regular exercise, seemed to be important. None, however, could predict satisfactorily women at future risk for osteoporosis. Direct measurements of bone density in the clinically relevant sites are necessary to determine which women should received preventive treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis. This would help make such treatment more cost effective.\r"

Low income practices (with a net income of less than 20,000 pounds per partner) were smaller, located in more urban areas, and more likely to have Asian partners. High income practices had higher costs per patient and more staff resources. Low income practices had fewer practice resources and faced great disincentives to investment. These practices were concentrated in less affluent areas, where the need for improved organisation of practices is greatest. General practice is becoming increasingly divided between high income, high cost practices and those with low incomes and few resources.\r"

DESIGN--Comparison of agglutination test specific for serotype with culture of blood and lung aspirates, countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis, and commercial latex agglutination tests in diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia. Cross reaction studies and investigation of 102 control children to determine specificity of agglutination test specific for serotype. SETTING--General medical ward of Medical Research Council laboratories, The Gambia. PATIENTS--101 Gambian children aged between 2 months and 10 years admitted with severe pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS--Serum samples were boiled and treated with edetic acid, and urine samples were boiled and concentrated 25 times before testing. END POINT--A latex agglutination test specific for the serotype of pneumococcal antigen that is sensitive and highly specific for detecting pneumococcus in the urine of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Concentrated urine samples from 16 of the 21 children (76%) with pneumococcal pneumonia established by results of culture of blood or lung aspirates gave a positive result with the agglutination test specific for serotype, whereas only four of the 102 urine samples obtained from control children without pneumonia gave positive results. The serotypes of antigens detected in the urine of children with pneumococcal pneumonia and the serotypes of pneumococci isolated from cultures of blood or lung aspirates were the same in all cases. CONCLUSIONS--When performed on urine samples the agglutination test specific for serotype has a high specificity and is more sensitive than culture of blood or lung aspirates, commercial agglutination tests, or countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis in identifying pneumococcal pneumonia. It is easy to use and should be especially useful in communities with limited laboratory facilities.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To estimate the cumulative incidence of AIDS by time since seroconversion in haemophiliacs positive for HIV and to examine the evidence for excess mortality associated with HIV in those who had not yet been diagnosed as having AIDS. DESIGN--Analysis of data from ongoing national surveys. SETTING--Haemophilia centres in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS--A total of 1201 men with haemophilia who had lived in the United Kingdom during 1980-7 and were positive for HIV. INTERVENTION--None. END POINTS--Diagnosis of AIDS; death in those not diagnosed as having AIDS. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Estimation of cumulative incidence of AIDS and number of excess deaths in seropositive patients not diagnosed with AIDS. Median follow up after seroconversion was 5 years 2 months. Eight five patients developed AIDS. Cumulative incidence of AIDS five years after seroconversion was 4% among patients aged less than 25 at first test positive for HIV, 6% among those aged 25-44, and 19% among those aged greater than or equal to 45. There was little evidence that type or severity of haemophilia or type of factor VIII or IX that had caused HIV infection affected the rate of progression to AIDS. Mortality was increased among those who had not been diagnosed as having AIDS, especially among those with \"AIDS related complex.\" Thirteen deaths were observed among 36 patients diagnosed as having AIDS related complex against 0.65 expected, and 34 deaths in 1080 other patients against 22.77 expected; both calculations were based on mortality rates observed in haemophiliacs in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. CONCLUSIONS--Rate of progression to AIDS depended strongly on age. There is a substantial burden of fatal disease among patients positive for HIV who have not been formally diagnosed as having AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "An earlier study of peak expiratory flow (PEF) in normal adults contained too few men aged over 55 and women aged over 65 for the regression equations to be used for prediction in older people. A subsequent study was therefore carried out on an additional 23 men and 29 women aged 55 or over who were lifelong non-smokers and satisfied the same strict criteria of normality that had been used in the original study. The data from both studies were combined and a new model used to calculate equations for the regression of PEF on age and height in the two sexes. With this model predicted values could be derived for men and women aged between 15 and 85. These new equations gave predicted values in men and women aged less than 55 and 65, respectively, which were almost identical with those reported previously. The new regression equations for PEF enable values to be predicted for people aged 15-85 and so enhance the accuracy of testing in the elderly.\r"

None of the subjects had been liable during childhood or subsequently to expectoration, lower respiratory tract infection, wheeze, or shortness of breath. Observed values of PEF were expressed as differences from predicted. Analysis of the relation between smoking state and ventilatory function in the men disclosed significant reductions of PEF in current smokers, the deficits increasing with the amount smoked from a mean of 48.1 l/min in those smoking fewer than 20 cigarettes a day to 73.3 l/min in smokers of 20 or more a day. Significant reductions of PEF were also found in women who were currently smoking (mean 47.4 l/min) and in male ex-smokers of 20 or more cigarettes a day (mean 27.8 l/min). There was no significant reduction of PEF in male or female ex-smokers of fewer than 20 cigarettes a day. These findings suggest that factors besides smoking are concerned in the development of irreversible airflow obstruction.\r"

The perinatal mortality of 9.0 per 1000 births was significantly better than the national average of about 19.0 per 1000 for the overall period. During the audit home deliveries virtually stopped. The proportion of consultant bookings and deliveries more than doubled because of more stringent booking arrangements despite relocation of the previously isolated general practitioner unit to beneath the consultant unit. Abnormal deliveries also rose significantly. A \"steady state\" was achieved during the final 11 years in which 73% of women booked to be delivered by their general practitioner, 64% were admitted to the general practitioner unit, and 54% were delivered by their general practitioner. Though this is enough to sustain obstetric experience, the proportion might safely be increased.\r"

Serum samples were tested for viral markers. Of 116 patients, 101 had shared injecting equipment, 75 on the first occasion of injecting and 76 during the past year. Seventy said that sharing was because equipment was not available. In the past year 102 had been sexually active, a third having two to 20 partners; a quarter of the women had exchanged sexual intercourse for money. The four patients who were positive for antibody to HIV antigen had shared equipment or had intercourse with drug users from areas with a high prevalence of HIV. Eleven patients had injected drugs while in prison. Despite a low prevalence of HIV infection this infection remains a threat to drug users in London; strenuous efforts are still needed to prevent its further transmission.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective audit of 644 patients undergoing biliary tract operations has been conducted to assess the incidence of bile colonization and its association with the incidence of postoperative sepsis when all patients received the same prophylactic antibiotic. The accuracy of the determination of high-risk factors has been assessed as has the correlation between bile colonization and patients assessed as 'high risk'. Organisms were cultured from the bile of 121 (19 per cent) patients and among these the incidence of wound or intra-abdominal sepsis was 22 per cent whereas among patients with sterile bile the incidence was only 2 per cent (P less than 0.0001). Although the incidence of bile colonization within the high-risk group (32 per cent) was more than twice that in the low-risk group (14 per cent), more than half (54 per cent) of the patients with positive bile cultures were in the low-risk group. It is concluded that, despite prophylactic antibiotics, bile colonization remains the major factor associated with postoperative sepsis, but that this cannot be predicted accurately by preoperative assessment of high-risk factors. Furthermore, we believe that a policy of selective administration of prophylactic antibiotics solely to high-risk patients cannot be justified.\r"

  ".U": "89248719\r", 
  ".W": "A consensus group convened under the auspices of the Ontario Medical Association produced guidelines for the use of intravenous thrombolytic agents in acute myocardial infarction. The guidelines, updated to December 1988, include the following points. 1) Any hospital that routinely accepts the responsibility for looking after patients with acute myocardial infarction could offer thrombolytic therapy if monitoring facilities are available and if the staff are experienced in the treatment of cardiac rhythm disturbances. 2) Before treatment, all patients must be carefully screened for factors predisposing to hemorrhagic complications. 3) A physician should be clearly designated as responsible for the care of the patient receiving an infusion and be available in the event of problems. 4) For the two approved agents the usual dosages are as follows: streptokinase, 1.5 million units given over 1 hour; and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), 100 mg over 3 hours, delivered as 60 mg in the first hour (of which 6 to 7 mg should be given as a bolus in the first 1 to 2 minutes) and then an infusion of 20 mg/h over the next 2 hours. 5) Intravenous thrombolytics should be considered for any patient with presumed acute myocardial infarction, as suggested by prolonged chest pain or other appropriate symptoms and typical electrocardiographic changes. Expeditious treatment is critical, since myocardial necrosis occurs within hours. 6) Emergency angiography is indicated for patients with hemodynamic compromise and no apparent response to streptokinase or tPA and in those with recurrent chest pain suggestive of acute myocardial infarction despite an apparent response to intravenous thrombolysis. Angiography before discharge is recommended for patients with postinfarction angina or evidence from noninvasive testing of significant residual ischemic risk. 7) There is insufficient evidence to choose between streptokinase and tPA on the basis of the two most important outcome measures: patient survival and myocardial preservation. More conclusive evidence comparing tPA, streptokinase and another promising agent, acylated plasminogen-streptokinase activator complex, will be available in 1989-90.\r"

Nitroglycerin, in 1 microgram.kg-1.min-1, decreased cardiac index (CI) and PaO2 during both two- and one-lung ventilation, and increased in Qs/Qt during one-lung ventilation. There were no significant changes in the measured variables during infusion of dopamine, 5 microgram.kg-1.min-1. Dobutamine, 5 microgram.kg-1.min-1, increased CI and PaO2 did not change during two-lung ventilation. During one-lung ventilation, PaO2 increased from (mean value +/- SD) 168 +/- 46 to 201 +/- 52 mmHg (P less than 0.01) with dobutamine infusion. Qs/Qt decreased from 29.2 +/- 7.0 to 26.0 +/- 6.2 per cent (P less than 0.05) without any change in pulmonary vascular resistance index during one-lung ventilation. We conclude that dobutamine has advantages over dopamine and nitroglycerin during one-lung ventilation.\r"

This implies that high-affinity binding sites have little to do with Na-K pump inhibition during exposure to cardiac glycosides. To better understand the role of the high-affinity site, we investigated the concentration dependence of Ipump inhibition by dihydroouabain (DHO) in guinea pig ventricular myocytes through use of wide-pore patch pipettes to \"fix\" internal Na+ activity at approximately 30 mM and to voltage clamp at -40 mV (T = 34 degrees C). DHO was found to have no effect on membrane conductance at a holding potential of -40 mV. Holding current was monitored and the difference between steady-state holding current before and during external exposure to nine concentrations (range, 0.01-1,000 microM) of DHO was measured and normalized to cellular membrane capacitance. The concentration dependence of the inhibition of Na-K pump current was biphasic and well fitted to a two-binding site model with inhibitory KD values of 0.05 microM and 64.5 microM. This is consistent with previously reported 3H-ouabain binding studies in guinea pig myocardium. These findings indicate that the electrogenic properties of the Na-K pump can be inhibited by glycoside binding to both high- and low-affinity sites.\r"

A column of porcine aortic endothelial cells grown on microcarrier beads in suspension culture was perfused with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. The release of relaxing factor(s) by the endothelial cells was detected under bioassay conditions by measuring the relaxing activity of the perfusate overflowing a ring of canine coronary artery (without endothelium) contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha. Incubation of the endothelial cells with ouabain did not affect the relaxation of the bioassay ring under basal conditions or upon stimulation of the endothelial cells with ADP but impaired the relaxation induced by bradykinin or the calcium ionophore A23187. Incubation of the bioassay ring with ouabain reduced the relaxation under basal conditions as well as the relaxation induced by ADP but did not affect the relaxation observed upon stimulation with bradykinin and A23187 and the endothelium-independent relaxations induced by nitric oxide. These experiments suggest that cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells release two endothelium-derived relaxing factors; one is released under basal conditions and upon stimulation with adenosine diphosphate and the other (which presumably is nitric oxide) upon stimulation with bradykinin and the calcium ionophore A23187.\r"

  ".W": "To identify factors responsible for the decline of plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA)-specific activity that we have observed after infusions of the activator and to define the potential usefulness of selected variants of t-PA in obviating them in patients with infarction, serial plasma samples from patients (n = 4) and rabbits (n = 15) given t-PA were assayed for total t-PA antigen, t-PA activity, and free as opposed to type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1)--complexed t-PA. In patients, attenuation of t-PA specific activity after infusions was evident with concentrations of total t-PA antigen that were as much as sevenfold greater than pretreatment values (62 compared with 9 ng/ml). Attenuation of t-PA activity corresponded with the disappearance of free t-PA from plasma and was associated with persistence of complexes of t-PA with PAI-1. In normal rabbits (n = 4) given wild-type t-PA by bolus injection, PAI-1 activity was 4 +/- 1 arbitrary units/ml. Attenuation of t-PA activity was not evident until 60 minutes after injection at a time when total plasma t-PA antigen concentration was as low as 13 +/- 8 ng/ml. Under these conditions, plasma t-PA was composed predominantly of free t-PA. In rabbits (n = 5) given lipopolysaccharide to increase plasma PAI-1 activity to 193 +/- 84 arbitrary units/ml, the specific activity of t-PA was attenuated as early as 15 minutes after injection at a time when total t-PA antigen concentration was as high as 164 +/- 79 ng/ml. As was the case with samples from patients, attenuation was associated with the disappearance of free t-PA and the persistence of complexes of t-PA with PAI-1. A genetically engineered variant of t-PA with comparable specific activity and a comparable rate constant of association with PAI-1 but designed to persist in the circulation manifested prolonged clearance from plasma of normal rabbits (n = 3) (t1/2 = 24.6 +/- 1.6 minutes compared with an alpha phase t1/2 of 1.9 minutes for wild-type t-PA). The variant lacked the epidermal growth factor and kringle one domains and contained a duplicated kringle two domain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the influence of alterations in preload on pulsed Doppler indexes of left ventricular diastolic function in 50 patients including 12 without cardiovascular disease, 29 with coronary artery disease, and nine with critical aortic stenosis. Micromanometer left ventricular pressure was recorded simultaneously with pulsed Doppler echocardiography of left ventricular inflow and M-mode echocardiography of left ventricular diameter. Chamber stiffness constants, kd and kv, were obtained from the diastolic pressure-diameter and pressure-volume relations, respectively. Relaxation was measured by the isovolumic relaxation time constants, TL and TD, derived from the exponential left ventricular pressure decay and maximum negative dP/dt. In 41 patients after nitroglycerin treatment, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 18 +/- 5 to 13 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The ratio of peak early to peak atrial filling velocities and time-velocity integral ratios decreased from 1.08 +/- 0.57 to 0.90 +/- 0.42 (p less than 0.001) and from 1.77 +/- 0.95 to 1.41 +/- 0.71 (p less than 0.001), respectively. The peak early filling velocity and time-velocity integral decreased from 56.1 +/- 15.7 to 49.9 +/- 14.5 cm/sec (p less than 0.001) and from 7.9 +/- 2.7 to 6.8 +/- 2.8 cm (p less than 0.001), respectively. Relaxation (TL, TD, and maximum negative dP/dt) and chamber stiffness (kd and kv) were not impaired after nitroglycerin administration. In 48 patients after ventriculography, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased from 18 +/- 6 to 22 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The peak early and peak atrial filling velocities increased from 57.4 +/- 15.2 to 68.3 +/- 19.7 cm/sec (p less than 0.001) and from 61.0 +/- 22.7 to 69.4 +/- 23.2 cm/sec (p less than 0.01), respectively. As a result, the ratio of peak early to peak atrial filling velocity was unchanged. However, in the aortic stenosis group, the ratio of peak early to peak atrial filling velocity increased from 0.95 +/- 0.64 to 1.10 +/- 0.72 (p less than 0.02). Relaxation and chamber stiffness were unchanged. Thus, a reduction or increase in preload may induce a diastolic filling pattern that mimics or masks diastolic dysfunction, respectively. Preload conditions need to be accounted for when the status of diastolic function is extrapolated from the pulsed Doppler mitral inflow velocity profile.\r"

Arthrography proved reliable in identifying the depth of reduction (medial dye column, 100%), the configuration of the osteocartilaginous structures (96%), and the presence of potentially obstructing soft tissue (limbus, 98%, and ligamentum teres, 78%). Arthrography was less reliable in discerning psoas contracture (36%), despite its presence at all open reductions. Arthrography proved reliable in outlining the inverted limbus that can obstruct closed reduction. Because ossification of the femoral head was frequently eccentric, the center edge (CE) angle of Wiberg was calculated from arthrography more accurately than from roentgenograms.\r"

Strict monitoring of dietary intake, growth velocity, and biochemical parameters are essential while providing nutritional support. The complication of parenteral nutrition can be reduced by following standard recommendations for preparing solutions, caring for the central and the peripheral catheters, and biochemically monitoring the infant. The organization of a hospital nutrition support service composed of physicians, nurses, nutritionists, and pharmacists is essential in establishing guidelines for the safe delivery of nutritional therapy and in educating hospital personnel and parents on how to best meet the nutritional needs of the surgical neonate.\r"

After follow-up of 7 +/- 3 months (SD), mexiletine was successful in 5 of 13 patients initially and in 5 of 14 patients who failed to respond to tocainide. Tocainide was successful in 1 of 17 patients initially and in 2 of 7 who did not respond to mexiletine. Combination therapy was used in nearly half of all ultimately successful drug trials. A common cause of drug trial failure for both drugs was the occurrence of adverse effects that frequently appeared well after hospital discharge. Response to lidocaine was a sensitive but nonspecific predictor of clinical outcome with mexiletine or tocainide that helped to identify drug-resistant patients. Finally, although mexiletine provided effective antiarrhythmic therapy more often than tocainide, response to one lidocaine analogue did not predict response to the other.\r"

The renal clearance was similar (p greater than 0.05) in PMs (308 +/- 70 ml/min) and EMs (315 +/- 69 ml/min) and, consequently, PMs had a lower (p less than 0.008) metabolic clearance of flecainide (292 +/- 136 versus 726 +/- 240 ml/min in EMs). Under conditions of uncontrolled urinary flow and pH, renal excretion of flecainide will be reduced and the difference in disposition will be greater. In PMs with renal impairment, accumulation of flecainide to very high serum concentrations may be anticipated, and this may result in proarrhythmic effects.\r"

  ".W": "1. Urinary excretion of dopamine (DA) increases during dietary salt loading. The majority of urinary DA is derived from circulating dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa). Whether the increase in urinary DA excretion during salt loading results from increased efficiency of uptake of dopa by proximal tubular cells of the kidney, facilitation of intracellular conversion of dopa to DA, or increased delivery of dopa to tubular uptake sites, has been unknown. 2. In 10 inpatient normal volunteers on a constant diet, daily excretion of dopa and DA was assessed during normal sodium intake (109 mmol/day) for 1 week, low sodium intake (9 mmol/day) for 1 week and high sodium intake (249 mmol/day) for 1 week. 3. Urinary DA excretion exceeded urinary dopa excretion by about tenfold, and the excretion of both DA and dopa increased by about twofold between the low and high salt diets, with similar proportionate changes. Plasma dopa was unchanged by dietary salt manipulation. 4. The results indicate that increases in urinary DA excretion during dietary salt loading can be accounted for by increased delivery of dopa to sites of uptake by proximal tubular cells. Since dopa is released into the bloodstream by sympathetic nerve endings and by the brain, and since interference with decarboxylation of dopa attenuates natriuretic responses, dopa may function indirectly as a neurohormone involved in homoeostatic regulation of sodium balance.\r"

This study evaluates these changes in preterm infants who required ventilatory assistance. We measured transcutaneous PO2 and PCO2 (PtcO2 and PtcCO2, respectively), intra-arterial BP, heart rate, ICP, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) before, during, and for at least 5 min after ET suctioning in 15 low birth weight infants less than 1500 g and less than or equal to 30 days of age. One infant was studied twice. A suction adaptor was used to avoid disconnecting the patient from the ventilator and to attempt to minimize hypoxemia and hypercapnia during suctioning. The patients were studied in the supine position and muscle relaxants were not used. PtcO2 decreased 12.1% while PtcCO2 increased 4.7% 1 min after suctioning; however, greater increases in mean BP (33%) and ICP (117%) were observed during suctioning. CPP also increased during the procedure. ICP returned to baseline almost immediately, whereas BP remained slightly elevated 1 min after suctioning. Our findings demonstrate that ET suctioning significantly increases BP, ICP, and CPP in preterm infants on assisted ventilation in the first month of life. These changes appear to be independent of changes observed in oxygenation and ventilation.\r"

PtcO2 and PlO2 correlated well with cardiac index (CI) r = .71 and .86, respectively; n = 60) and with each other (r = .79; n = 60). Heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and PaO2) correlated less with PtcO2 or PlO2. During the normotensive shock period, PtcO2, PIO2, CI, oxygen delivery (DO2), and oxygen consumption (VO2) were all severely decreased, while PaO2 and MAP were normal and lactic acid concentrations were elevated. It was concluded that PtcO2 follows changes in PlO2 during hypotensive and normotensive low cardiac output shock in mongrel dogs. Low PtcO2 values are associated with low values of PlO2, DO2, VO2, and rising lactic acid concentrations in dogs. These animal data imply that low PtcO2 values encountered in clinical monitoring during anesthesia and surgery may correspond to decreased blood volume, blood flow, and PlO2.\r"

These effects were also compared with those of dopamine. The db-cAMP and dopamine were infused at 200 and 20 micrograms/kg.min, respectively. Metabolic acidosis (pH 7.00, PaCO2 40 torr) was induced by the iv infusion of 1-M ammonium chloride solution (NH4Cl). In the normal acid-base state, both db-cAMP and dopamine significantly increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). During metabolic acidosis, db-cAMP increased cardiac output by 69 +/- 14% and decreased SVR by 36 +/- 2%, while dopamine did not produce changes in cardiac output and increased SVR. Dopamine caused an elevation of epinephrine and norepinephrine in the normal acid-base state, but db-cAMP did not. During metabolic acidosis, dopamine significantly increased the plasma concentration of epinephrine and norepinephrine, while db-cAMP significantly decreased epinephrine concentration. These results suggest that db-cAMP may have a more beneficial effect on hemodynamics compared with dopamine when therapeutic support is needed during circulatory insufficiency with severe metabolic acidosis.\r"

PtcCO2 was measured using a combination CO2/O2 sensor during the routine care of these patients. End-tidal sidestream sampling was performed during blood gas measurement as dictated by the patient's clinical condition. There was a linear correlation between PtcCO2 and PaCO2 (n = 51, r = .71, slope = 0.90). PetCO2 and PaCO2 did not correlate as well (n = 51, r = .52, slope = 0.42). Acidosis negatively affected the correlation between PtcCO2 and PaCO2. When pH was greater than 7.30, r = .75 and slope = 1.28 (n = 38), whereas when pH was less than 7.30, r = .62 and slope = 0.73 (n = 13). The presence or absence of a metabolic acidosis did not have a significant effect on the slopes obtained. PtcCO2 monitoring using combined sensors is a useful and practical means of monitoring in the neonatal ICU, although acidosis affects the ability to correlate transcutaneous and arterial values. End-tidal sidestream measurements are not as clinically useful because they vary due to different ventilation/perfusion relationships in the sick neonate.\r"

Simultaneous recordings of exhaled CO2 were made with a sidestream and a mainstream machine; arterial blood gases were measured for comparison. The mean arterial to end-tidal CO2 difference (PaCO2-PetCO2) was approximately 5 torr with either technique; the correlation of PetCO2 with PaCO2 was slightly better with the mainstream analyzer (r2 = .895 vs. .654). The recordings obtained with the sidestream machine were grossly distorted, with flattening of the ascending limb (slope 37.3 vs. 153.3 torr/sec, sidestream vs. mainstream, p less than .001) and absence of the alveolar plateau. The mainstream analyzer gives a more accurate representation of the expired CO2 waveform in small children at rapid respiratory rates.\r"

Since sodium cromoglycate is an effective drug in the prophylactic treatment of all types of asthma, we assessed the effect of a three-month treatment on nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness in 11 patients with perennial asthma. Bronchial responsiveness was determined by histamine bronchoprovocation test, using SGaw as the index of lung function and expressed as PD35SGaw. During the run-in period of one month when sodium cromoglycate was not used, the histamine PD35SGaw decreased significantly from 0.15 +/- 0.30 to 0.09 +/- 0.29 mg/ml (p less than 0.001). After three months of treatment with the drug, bronchial hyperresponsiveness was reduced significantly; the PD35SGaw was 0.21 +/- 0.29 mg/ml (p less than 0.001). It was concluded that long-term treatment of patients with perennial asthma with sodium cromoglycate results in reduced bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\r"

Oral feeding abolished regular contractions in the proximal stomach. There was a simultaneous fall in the proximal gastric baseline force, which slowly recovered to the preprandial level, at which time regular contractions returned. The magnitude and duration of these events varied with the type of meal, as did the distal gastric response, which was characterized by abolition of the fasting motor pattern and establishment of continuous low-amplitude contractions. Duodenal feeding of a nutrient, but not nonnutrient, meal abolished fasting motor activity in both proximal and distal stomach but did not induce either a fall in proximal gastric baseline force or distal gastric contractions. These results suggest that stimulation of duodenal as well as gastric receptors is required to elicit the normal prandial response of both proximal and distal stomach.\r"

NA pretreatment at 37 C for 30 min increased specific FSH binding (P less than 0.01) and had no effect on LH binding to the GCs harvested from follicles of different sizes. Analysis of equilibrium binding experiments revealed that NA increased the number of FSH-binding sites without altering the affinity. In addition, pretreatment with NA resulted in progressive loss of cell membrane-bound sialic acid (P less than 0.01). To evaluate whether the unmasked FSH receptors constitute functional gonadotropin-binding sites, we measured the amounts of cAMP and 17 beta-estradiol produced by cultured GCs pretreated with NA. cAMP formation by GCs pretreated with NA was significantly (P less than 0.02) greater than that by GCs pretreated with medium alone in the presence of ovine FSH. Moreover, 17 beta-estradiol formation significantly increased (P less than 0.05) in GCs pretreated with NA compared with that in GCs pretreated with medium alone. However, there was no difference between medium-treated and NA-treated GCs in cAMP formation stimulated by forskolin. We suggest that porcine GCs contain a population of masked FSH-binding sites exposed by in vitro pretreatment of NA, and the binding sites constitute functional receptors capable of increasing cAMP and 17 beta-estradiol formation with FSH stimulation. Moreover, a possible involvement of plasma membrane-associated sialic acid in the masking/unmasking mechanism of FSH-binding sites was suggested.\r"

  ".W": "In GH4C1 rat pituitary cells, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3] amplifies the TRH-induced spike phase of increase in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i). In the present report we describe the results of investigations on the mechanisms of action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on Ca2+ homeostasis in these cells. Pretreatment with 1 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 for at least 24 h caused no change in basal uptake of 45Ca2+ compared with that in control cells or in 45Ca2+ uptake induced by the calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644. However, when the cells were depolarized with 50 mM K+, 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells showed an up to 90% enhancement of uptake (3-120 min) of 45Ca2+. An enhanced increase in [Ca2+]i was also observed in fura-2-loaded cells. The effect was specific and dose dependent for 1,25-(OH)2D3. The calcium channel antagonists nimodipine and verapamil inhibited completely the enhancing action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 as did the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. No enhanced uptake of 45Ca2+ into intracellular stores was detected when cells were incubated with 1,25-(OH)2D3. Na+/Ca2+ exchange was determined by measuring exchange of extracellular 45Ca2+ for intracellular Na+. Na+/Ca2+ exchange was dependent on intracellular Na+, was inactive when Li+ replaced Na+, was insensitive to calcium channel antagonists, and showed electrogenic properties. In cells incubated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for at least 24 h, Na+/Ca2+ exchange was enhanced up to 54% compared with that in control cells. Enhanced exchange was dose dependent and specific for 1,25-(OH)2D3. Ca2+ channel antagonists were without effect while dichlorobenzamil inhibited partially the 1,25-(OH)2D3 enhancement of Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Cycloheximide abolished completely the action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on Na+/Ca2+ exchange. We conclude that in GH4C1 cells, 1,25-(OH)2D3 enhances membrane calcium transport by modulating voltage-operated Ca2+ channels and activating Na+/Ca2+ exchange by mechanisms requiring new protein synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have implicated arginine vasopressin (AVP) as a negative intratesticular modulator of androgen production. The present studies were undertaken to further define the testicular AVP system by investigating potential influences of pituitary hormones on testicular receptors for AVP. Binding of [3H]AVP to testicular membranes was time, temperature, and pH dependent, with optimum binding at 90 min, 22 C, and pH 8.0. Addition of divalent cations to the incubation mixture significantly increased binding by 4-, 10-, 15-, and 35-fold with Ca2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+, respectively. The influence of pituitary hormones on testicular AVP receptors was initially assessed by comparing binding parameters obtained by Scatchard analysis of saturation binding data between membranes prepared from intact or hypophysectomized rats. Testicular membranes from intact animals bound 66 +/- 2 fmol AVP/mg protein, whereas membranes from animals hypophysectomized 10 days previously showed a significantly lower binding capacity of 40 +/- 3 fmol AVP/mg protein; however, the affinity of the receptors for AVP did not differ between these two groups. A similar decrease was observed when binding was compared between purified Leydig cells isolated from intact and hypophysectomized animals by Metrizamide density gradients. Time-course analysis of this effect showed a continuous decline in total testicular AVP-binding capacity for the first 2 weeks after hypophysectomy and a slight increase at 3 weeks. Treatment of hypophysectomized animals with pituitary hormones beginning on the third day after hypophysectomy and continuing for either 4 or 7 days showed that LH and GH were able to dose-dependently restore testicular AVP-binding capacity to levels found in intact animals, whereas FSH and PRL were ineffective. These data indicate that testicular AVP receptors are under the control of LH and GH from the pituitary and suggest that pituitary hormones may impact on the efficacy of the testicular AVP system by regulating AVP receptor levels.\r"

Stimulation was observed after a 15-min, but not a 4-h, incubation. The concentrations of GHRP-6 required for half-maximal and maximal stimulation were 7 x 10(-9) and 10(-7) M, respectively. GH release induced by GHRP-6 was not affected by the addition of either naloxone or the GRF antagonist [N-Ac-Tyr1,D-Arg2]GRF-(1-29)-NH2. The latter inhibited GRF-stimulated GH release by shifting the dose-response curve to the right. His-D-Trp-D-Lys-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2, an analog of GHRP-6, inhibited GH release stimulated by GHRP-6 without affecting that induced by GRF. When present together at maximal concentrations, GHRP-6 and GRF produced a synergistic effect on GH release. GHRP-6 had no effect on intracellular cAMP levels, whereas GRF increased intracellular cAMP concentrations by 3-fold. Combined treatment of pituitary cells with GRF and GHRP-6 resulted in a potentiation of the GRF-induced increase in cAMP levels. Basal GH release was reduced by 30% after pretreatment with GHRP-6 (10(-7) M) for 1 h. Pretreatment with GHRP-6 also decreased the subsequent response to GHRP-6, but not GRF. In contrast, pretreatment with GRF for 1 h had no effect on the subsequent action of GHRP-6 or GRF on GH release. The desensitization induced by GHRP-6 was completely reversed within 1 h after removal of the peptide. Results from this study indicate that GHRP-6 and GRF stimulated GH release from somatotrophs via different receptors and through discrete mechanisms.\r"

We used in vitro autoradiography with [125I] ANGII and [125I]ANF to compare receptor regulation for both peptides in various tissues in three experimental models of hypertension [two-kidney, one-clip (2K-1C); one-kidney, one-clip (1K-1C); desoxycorticosterone-salt (DOCA-SALT)] and three nonhypertensive control groups [two-kidney (2K-CON); one-kidney (1K-CON); salt-loaded (SALT-CON)]. Blood pressures at death were significantly higher in all three hypertensive groups compared to those in normotensive controls, but there were no significant differences among the hypertensive or normotensive groups, respectively. PRA was highest in the 2K-1C group and lowest in the DOCA-SALT and SALT-CON groups, but plasma ANF levels did not differ significantly among the hypertensive or normotensive groups. In the aorta, ANGII receptor binding was decreased in 2K-1C rats and increased in DOCA-SALT and SALT-CON rats; ANF receptor binding was moderately increased in all three hypertensive groups. Adrenal zona glomerulosa binding for ANGII was highest in the 2K-1C group and lowest in DOCA-SALT rats, while ANF binding was decreased in DOCA-SALT and SALT-CON animals. ANGII renal glomerular binding was increased in DOCA-SALT and SALT-CON groups, and ANF glomerular binding was decreased in the same two groups. In the brain, the subfornical organ showed increased binding for both ANGII and ANF in DOCA-SALT rats. Our results show that tissue receptor binding of ANGII and ANF is regulated in distinct patterns in different models of hypertension, and that these patterns are tissue specific and more complex than simple reciprocal regulation.\r"

The antiserum obtained was purified initially by ammonium sulfate fractionation and then still further by interaction with a protein fraction from pancreas that was devoid of estradiol-binding activity. The latter procedure was used to precipitate nonspecific immunoglobulin Gs. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the anti-EBP antibody reacted specifically with a doublet of protein bands having mol wt of 64K and 66K. When this purified antibody was used as an immunocytochemical probe in conjunction with protein-A-gold, acinar cells were labeled on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, on the plasma membrane, and in mitochondria. This specific labeling pattern was not observed when preimmune serum was used. No labeling was observed over the nucleus, Golgi apparatus, or zymogen granules with purified anti-EBP antibodies.

  ".W": "Recent work indicates that PTH can stimulate osteoblastic cells to secrete neutral collagenase, an enzyme thought to be linked to bone matrix turnover. Since recent studies suggest that the calcium/protein kinase-C (PKC) message system is involved in signal transduction stimulated by PTH, we examined the role of these putative second messengers of PTH in the regulation of collagenase production by the osteoblastic tumor cell line UMR 106-01. Immunohistochemical staining of cells exposed to PTH (10(-7) M) revealed that about 20% of the entire population was positive for collagenase, compared to less than 3% staining positively in control untreated cells. Incubation with the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP (8BrcAMP) increased the number of collagenase-staining cells in a dose-dependent manner (ED0.5 = 2.5 x 10(-4) M), but to a lower level than PTH, with the maximal effect producing about 15% positive cells. The calcium ionophore ionomycin (10(-7) M) was ineffective, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, increased collagenase-specific staining to about 5%, but only at high concentrations (10(-5) M). Incubation of UMR 106-01 cells with ionomycin and PMA did not change the effect of the latter. When the three agents were used in combination, an additive effect was observed, which fully reproduced that of PTH. Similarly, the amount of collagenase released into the medium by cells stimulated with maximal concentrations of 8BrcAMP (10(-3) M) was only 80% of that induced by maximal doses of PTH (10(-7) M). PMA (10(-5) M) was slightly stimulatory, and ionomycin was ineffective alone, but they were synergistic with submaximal doses of 8BrcAMP (10(-4) M). In agreement with the immunohistochemical results, the full hormonal effect was reproduced when the three second messenger analogs were used in combination. In conclusion, signal transduction from PTH receptor to collagenase production is mediated mainly by cAMP; the Ca2+/PKC system appears to have a contributory role necessary for the full expression of hormonal response. These results support the hypothesis of a dual pathway of target cell activation by PTH.\r"

This was determined by examining the changes in the secretion parameters of FSH and LH that resulted from immunoneutralizing endogenous inhibin in diestrous I female rats. Passive immunoneutralization of endogenous inhibin was achieved using specific, high titer ovine antiserum generated against the alpha-subunit of the recently described inhibin molecule. The optimal times after inhibin immunoneutralization to observe the changes in FSH secretion were determined in initial experiments. Pulsatile secretion of both FSH and LH was observable in the diestrous female. Two hours after inhibin immunoneutralization, the mean trough level, mean peak level, and overall mean level of FSH began to increase. The maximal increase and plateau of these parameters were observed 5 h after antiserum injection. During the period of increase, mean FSH pulse amplitude was also increased, but returned to the level observed in control (normal sheep serum-injected) animals when the parameters of trough, peak, and overall mean FSH reached their plateau levels. FSH pulse frequency was not changed at any time. These results indicate that endogenous inhibin affects only the basal parameters of FSH secretion without affecting pulsatile FSH secretion. The transient increase in FSH pulse amplitude resulted from FSH pulses being superimposed on the increasing basal FSH secretion. In contrast, immunoneutralization of endogenous inhibin rapidly increased all parameters (i.e. pulse amplitude and frequency, mean trough and peak levels, and mean plasma levels) of LH secretion. In addition, pituitary sensitivity to an exogenous LHRH challenge was increased in inhibin-immunoneutralized females in terms of stimulated LH secretion. As a result of the already increased rate of basal secretion, the actual quantity of FSH released in response to the LHRH challenge was greatly increased in the inhibin-immunoneutralized rats compared with the normal sheep serum-injected controls; however, the increase in the rate of FSH secretion stimulated by the LHRH challenge was the same in both groups. The observations from these studies collectively demonstrate that inhibin acts endogenously to suppress those parameters of gonadotropin secretion that are regulated by LHRH.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of Sertoli cell function was investigated through an examination of the effects of various hormones, regulatory agents, and culture conditions on testicular transferrin and androgen-binding protein (ABP) synthesis and steady state levels of mRNA. FSH stimulated both transferrin and ABP production 2-fold above control levels. Interestingly, FSH had a differential effect on transferrin and ABP mRNA levels, with 1.25- and 2.0-fold respective increases in steady state levels of mRNA. Insulin and retinol stimulated both transferrin and ABP synthesis in a similar manner. Testosterone had no significant effect on either transferrin or ABP mRNA levels or synthesis. Maximum stimulation of both transferrin and ABP production occurred when Sertoli cell cultures were treated with a combination of FSH, insulin, and retinol, which resulted in a greater than 4-fold stimulation of synthesis and 2-fold stimulation of gene expression. Optimal transferrin and ABP secretion occurred between days 4-6 of Sertoli cell culture and subsequently declined. Sertoli cell number decreased with time in culture, such that approximately a 50% loss of cells was observed after 10 days of culture. The responsiveness of Sertoli cells to regulatory agents was altered by cell density, with a maximum responsiveness achieved at a density of 12 micrograms DNA/2 cm2 for both transferrin and ABP. As the cell density deviated from this level the responsiveness of cells to regulatory agents decreased and approached control values. These observations indicate that the culture conditions and the method of data normalization are important parameters in an analysis of the hormonal regulation of Sertoli cell function. FSH actions on Sertoli cells increased both cellular and excreted cAMP levels but had no effect on cGMP levels. (Bu)2 cAMP affected transferrin and ABP mRNA levels and synthesis in a similar manner, with approximately a 3-fold increase in synthesis and a 1.5-fold increase in steady state levels of mRNA. The minimum and maximum effective concentrations of (Bu)2AMP for both proteins were 1 and 10 microM, respectively. Observations imply that regulatory agents that act via a cAMP-mediated signal transduction mechanism, such as FSH, will probably have similar actions on transferrin and ABP production. In addition, data obtained with insulin and retinol indicate that transferrin and ABP production can be similarly regulated with cAMP-independent signal transduction mechanisms. Results indicate that transferrin and ABP mRNA levels and synthesis are regulated in a coordinate manner with the regulatory agents and culture conditions evaluated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The studies described herein were designed to examine whether there is a threshold concentration of testosterone (T) within the seminiferous tubules that is required to maintain spermatogenesis in the rat, or alternatively, whether there is a dose-response relationship between the intratesticular T concentration and the maintenance of spermatogenesis. T was administered to intact adult male rats via sustained release polydimethylsiloxane capsules in order to experimentally clamp T at well defined concentrations within the seminiferous tubules. Implantation of T-filled capsules of increasing sizes resulted in linear increases in T concentrations in serum, interstitial fluid, and seminiferous tubule fluid (STF). We examined the effect of step decreases in intratesticular T concentration on the numbers of advanced spermatogenic cells maintained by the testis over a 2-month period. Quantitatively complete spermatogenesis was maintained despite an 80% reduction in the STF T concentration (to approximately 13 ng/ml) from control values. The ability of the testis to maintain complete spermatogenesis was extremely sensitive to further decreases in STF T concentration. Thus, reduction of the STF T concentration from approximately 13 to 9 ng/ml resulted in a reduction in the number of advanced spermatids that were maintained in the testis by approximately 100 x 10(6). Reduction of the STF T concentration to approximately 4 ng/ml resulted in a further reduction in the number of advanced spermatids per testis by 100 x 10(6). Taken together, these data support the contention that there is far more T present within the seminiferous tubules of intact rat testes than is required to maintain quantitatively normal spermatogenesis and reveal for the first time that there is a dose-response relationship between the STF T concentration and the quantitative maintenance of advanced spermatogenic cells in the rat testis.\r"

  ".W": "GH deprivation after passive immunization against rat GRF (rGRF) markedly affects somatic growth in male rats. Since it has been postulated that GH and probably insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) might have a permissive role on sexual maturation, the effects of GH deprivation on the course of sexual maturation were tested. Male rats were treated with a potent anti-rGRF serum between 15 and 39 days of life (0.25 ml administered sc every second day). Body weight of treated rats averaged 62% of that of control (normal rabbit serum-treated) rats at 40 days of life (d), and 64% at 50 d after which age, treated rats started to grow normally. At 40 and 50 d, pituitary GH content was very much depressed (representing approximately 20% of control values at both ages), plasma GH was undetectable, and plasma IGF-I levels averaged 30% of those of control rats. At 70 d, 30 days after cessation of treatment, pituitary GH content, and IGF-I secretion were almost normal. At 40 d, testes and seminal vesicles of treated rats were small-for-age in agreement with significantly decreased plasma levels of FSH and delayed spermatogenesis characterized by the presence of only few or no spermatozoa. At 50 d, 10 days after cessation of anti-rGRF injections, progress of sexual maturation was found to be consistent with age and coincided with normalization of growth rate. At 40 and 50 d, pituitary contents of FSH and LH were severely decreased but became normal at 70 d. In conclusion, GH deprivation which markedly affected somatic growth induced a transient delay of sexual maturation. GH deficiency seems to have affected mostly the synthesis and secretion of FSH, thus producing a delay in testes growth and in the differentiation of the germinal cells. The low levels of IGF-I might also have been the cause for the delay of maturation at the pituitary and/or the gonadal levels.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibin, a gonadal glycoprotein with selective FSH-suppressing activity, is synthesized by the Sertoli cell of the testis and the granulosa cell of the ovary mediated by the action of FSH. It is not known whether inhibin is produced by the fetal testes and ovaries or if FSH has the capacity to stimulate inhibin production by the fetal gonad. To explore these questions, we examined the bioactive inhibin content of the gonads of 16 chronically catheterized sheep fetuses between 111 and 143 days gestational age (0.7-0.95 gestation) in an ovine pituitary bioassay. Both the fetal testes and ovary contained inhibin activity (testes, 53.5-1,240 U inhibin/g tissue; ovaries, 58.5-2,250 U/g). After pulsatile administration of oFSH (5 micrograms every 3 h) to the fetus for 5 days in 1 fetus and 10 days in 2 fetuses, 10-day gonadal inhibin content of fetal testes increased to 5,080 +/- 3,180 U/testes (n = 3) vs. 165 +/- 50 U/testes in controls (n = 8; P less than 0.02); the concentration of testicular inhibin in these features rose to a mean of 9,100 +/- 6,620 vs. 415 +/- 126 U/g tissue in controls (P less than 0.01). Ovarian inhibin content in female fetuses given ovine FSH for 10 days was 5,220 +/- 4,920 U/ovary (n = 4) compared to 40 +/- 16 U/ovary in controls (n = 4); the inhibin concentration was 41,000 +/- 30,000 U/g in ovaries of FSH-treated fetuses vs. 1,190 +/- 960 U/g in controls. The ovary of 1 female fetus contained several large follicles and the highest inhibin concentration. Unexpectedly, FSH administration was associated with a decrease in testosterone content in the fetal testes and ovaries. The testosterone content was 0.54 +/- 0.42 ng/ovary after FSH treatment (n = 4) vs. 2.11 +/- 0.68 ng/ovary in controls (n = 4; P less than 0.02). The testosterone concentration fell to 5.8 +/- 2.0 ng/g in treated female fetuses vs. 60.3 +/- 14.6 ng/g in controls (P less than 0.0005). The testosterone content in fetal testes decreased to 21.7 +/- 6.9 ng/testes in FSH-treated fetuses (n = 3) vs. 75.1 +/- 24.0 ng/testes in controls (n = 5; P less than 0.04); the testosterone concentration fell to 38.6 +/- 16.1 ng/g tissue compared to 223.0 +/- 88.7 ng/g in untreated controls (P less than 0.03). In male fetuses the concentration of plasma testosterone decreased to 15.5 +/- 2.3 ng/dl after FSH treatment, significantly lower than 39.6 +/- 4.5 ng/dl in controls (P less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography and revealed a major band (17K) corresponding to the propeptide by Western blot analysis. Antibodies against ANF-(94-103) were used in a RIA. All of the peptides that possess this region (98-99) were able to displace iodinated pro-ANF from the antibody. However, peptides that have only one part of the fragment, such as ANF-(99-126) or ANF-(1-98), failed to displace pro-ANF; human ANF-(79-98) (100 pmol) demonstrated about 0.01% cross-reactivity. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that all atrial cardiocytes are reactive with the three antibodies. Immunocryoultramicrotomy revealed that the propeptide travels, uncleaved, from the Golgi complex to immature granules and mature secretory granules. These results indicate that cleavage of the ANF propeptide does not occur at these sites.\r"

We show that active immunisation of female sheep against a recombinant bovine alpha N impairs their fertility. In Exp 1, 5 treated (Group 1; 300 micrograms alpha N) and 6 control ewes (Group 2; adjuvant only) were immunized (Day 1) and given boosters on Days 22 and 56. In Group 1, mean +/- SEM binding of 125I-31 kDa Inh was less than 0.5% on Days 33 and 44, whereas binding of 125I-58 kDa Inh was 4.9 +/- 0.7 and 6.2 +/- 0.6%, respectively. In Group 2 binding of both tracers was less than 0.5%. The corpora lutea (CL)/ewe in Group 1 on Days 44 and 82 were 1.8 +/- 0.2 and 2.8 +/- 0.9, respectively, and were not different from those in Group 2 (1.7 +/- 0.3 and 1.5 +/- 0.2, respectively). One ewe in Group 1 versus 5/6 ewes in Group 2 were diagnosed pregnant. In Exp 2, 18 treated and 16 controls were immunized as in Exp 1. The binding of 125I-58 kDa Inh in treated ewes (2.4 +/- 0.3%) was greater than in controls (less than 0.5%) on Day 56. The CL/ewe in treated ewes (1.8 +/- 0.2) was similar to that in controls (2.0 +/- 0.1) on Day 76. All 16 control ewes but only 7/17 treated ewes were subsequently diagnosed pregnant. The plasma progesterone concentrations were similar in treated ewes which did (7.6 +/- 1.2 nmol/L) and did not (7.0 +/- 0.7) become pregnant. Neither basal nor GnRH-stimulated concentrations of LH, nor basal concentrations of Inh differed between treated and controls in Exp 2. Similarly, there were no differences in FSH, except that basal concentrations were higher in the luteal phase of treated ewes. We conclude that immunisation of ewes against alpha N results in a significant reduction in fertility.\r"

A variety of anticonvulsant medications eliminate El mouse seizures, including phenytoin (PHT), phenobarbital (PB), valproate (VPA), and ethosuximide (ESM). Anatomic studies have shown subtle differences in the thalamus and hippocampus of El mice. Immunohistochemistry of the El mouse hippocampus has revealed changes in peptidergic and gabaergic cell populations.

Drugs known to depress dorsal raphe unit activity, (+/-)-8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin (DPAT), imipramine, and fluoxetine prevented suppression of FEA induced by noxious stimulation. Desimipramine, which depresses locus ceruleus but not dorsal raphe unit activity, was ineffective in blocking the suppression. Quipazine, an agonist at 5-HT receptors, in part restored the suppression that had been blocked by DPAT or imipramine. Several serotonin antagonists effective at 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors blocked suppression, but an unequivocal determination of the serotonin receptor subtype mediating suppression could not be made. We conclude that 5-HT mediates suppression of FEA induced by noxious stimulation.\r"

Twenty-one patients (12 men and 9 women) completed the trial. An analysis of seizure counts in the 12-week treatment period with LTG showed a statistically significant reduction in seizures as compared with placebo for total seizures (p less than 0.002), partial seizures (p less than 0.002), and secondarily generalized seizures (p less than 0.05). The analysis of total seizure days showed a significant reduction during LTG treatment (p less than 0.002).

One dose was administered orally after an overnight fast, and the other was administered by nasogastric feeding tube during a continuous enteral feeding infusion. Serial serum CBZ concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to assess the effects of the enteral feeding on CBZ absorption. Noncompartmental methods were used to estimate pharmacokinetic data. One volunteer experienced a mild hypersensitivity reaction after his first CBZ dose and was withdrawn from the study. The other subjects tolerated both doses very well, although most experienced mild drowsiness or lightheadedness. Serum CBZ concentrations were lower during enteral feeding administration, but the differences were statistically significant only at 8 h (p = 0.044). Changes in pharmacokinetic data were not significant, although the decrease in maximum serum concentration approached significance (p = 0.052). The relative bioavailability of CBZ suspension with enteral feeding administration was 90.1% of that during fasting. There was a strong correlation between CBZ dose (mg/kg) and Cmax after oral administration (r = 0.97, Y = 1.88X - 4.49, p less than 0.001) but not during enteral feeding administration. Although absorption of CBZ suspension was generally slower and slightly diminished during nasogastric feeding, this interaction may lessen unwanted side effects.\r"

One possible site model explaining these findings may be that VPA competes strongly with one among three palmitate molecules, bound to albumin with high affinity, and induces a weaker displacement of a second palmitate.\r"

  ".W": "Because monotherapy with 19-nortestosterone hexyloxyphenylpropionate (Anadur, Pharmacia Arzneimittel, Ratingen, Federal Republic of Germany) suggested improved results for male contraception compared with available testosterone esters, it was tested for induction of complete azoospermia when combined with depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA, Clinovir, Upjohn GmbH, Heppenheim, Federal Republic of Germany). Twelve men were treated for 7 weeks with weekly intramuscular (IM) injections of 200 mg Anadur followed by 3-weekly IM injections of Anadur up to week 15. Clinovir (250 mg) IM was administered at the start of treatment and during weeks 6 and 12. Anadur and Clinovir suppressed serum gonadotropins. Although serum testosterone declined steeply, in general, libido and potency were not impaired. Sperm concentrations were reduced significantly after 3 weeks of treatment. Lowest sperm counts were seen during week 8 of follow-up, when only 2 volunteers showed measurable sperm counts of 2.1 and 3.0 X 10(6)/ml, with a declining tendency. After 43 weeks, sperm concentrations were still below pretreatment range in 2 men, but later returned to pretreatment values. Computerized sperm motion analysis revealed that motility parameters in the residual sperm were reduced. In vitro analysis excluded a direct effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate in seminal plasma on sperm motion. The data indicate that the combination of Anadur with Clinovir increases the rate of azoospermia in normal volunteers seen under Anadur monotherapy, although the goal of azoospermia in all participants was not quite achieved.\r"

This device has an outer diameter of 4.9 mm and can be delivered through most of the standard operative laparoscopic accessories. Two probes with miniature zinc selenide lenses of 6.5 mm and 17 mm back focal length attached at the distal end were tested. Through each probe, constant 0.5-second pulses and power levels of 5, 10, and 15 W were applied in three different lens-to-target distances. Measurements of beam spot diameters and microscopic crater characteristics revealed significant differences as a result of minor shifting of lens-target distance. From 7 to 9 mm beyond the focal plane and at power levels of 5 to 10 W, negligible tissue effects could be detected. This was defined as an \"optical back-stop\" effect. A new application mode using an easily maneuverable probe for cutting and coagulating [focusing/defocusing] effects increases the options available for operative laparoscopy.\r"

In all patients except 1, the uterine cavity area calculated by hysterosalpingography was decreased, with an average decrease of 35% (from 12.0 +/- 5.4 cm2 to 7.8 +/- 3.3 cm2) by 8 weeks of therapy. Significant decrease was observed in the group of women with initial uterine cavity area greater than 10 cm2. In patients with very large submucous fibroids, myomectomy by hysteroscopy and neodymium:YAG laser was easily performed. Rapid relief of symptoms such as menometrorrhagia permits the restoration of a normal hemoglobin concentration. In conclusion, use of GnRH analog represents an adjunct for preoperative reduction of tumor size and may permit surgical treatment by hysteroscopy.\r"

After therapy, patients were followed for 6 months without any therapy. Uterine volumes were measured by serial pelvic examinations and pelvic sonography. Measurements of serum estradiol, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone were used to assess treatment response. Pituitary desensitization and hypoestrogenemia were achieved in all within 8 weeks, and in 18 of 19, hypoestrogenemia was maintained for the duration. Uterine volume at the conclusion of therapy (207.5 +/- 152.7 ml) was significantly reduced in all patients when compared with pretreatment sizes (420.8 +/- 276.4, P less than 0.05). Side effects included hot flashes (78%), vaginal dryness (32%), and transient frontal headaches (55%). All patients reported partial or complete relief from their symptomatic leiomyomata. Uterine volume at the conclusion of follow-up (345.4 +/- 195.7 ml) was greater than at the conclusion of therapy. Menses resumed in all patients within 4 to 8 weeks. In conclusion, GnRH-a therapy does not provide definitive therapy for symptomatic uterine leiomyomata but is effective in reducing the size of leiomyomata as a temporary measure. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy may be useful as an adjunct before myomectomy or hysterectomy and deserves further investigation.\r"

Bioactive (B) LH and B-FSH also were measured after the IM administration of the 50-micrograms/kg dose. Serum levels of Nal1 Glu6 were determined by a radioreceptor assay for the first 24 hours after the 50-micrograms/kg IM dose and in three women after a 10-micrograms/kg intravenous (IV) dose. While the disappearance rate of serum Nal1 Glu6 after a 10-micrograms/kg IV injection was rapid, gonadotropin suppression persisted longer than detectable serum levels. In contrast, after a 50-micrograms/kg IM injection, the decline from peak circulating levels was slower, contributing to its longer duration of action (greater than 24 hours). All IM doses tested resulted in a similar 51% to 63% decrease in I-LH, which was maximal by 8 hours. The duration of action was dose-dependent, with decreased levels lasting up to 72 hours at the 300-micrograms/kg dose. While decline of I-FSH was smaller (14% to 33%), the duration of suppression was also dose-dependent, although the nadir occurs later (8 to 9 hours after administration) and suppression lasted longer (72 hours at the 150-micrograms/kg dose). The reduction of B-LH was greater than that of I-LH and the suppression of B-FSH also was greater than that of I-FSH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serial serum E2, P, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone were determined by radioimmunoassays. The dosages of E2 and P were adjusted according to the levels of E2 and P so that their changes could follow the same pattern as that of a normal spontaneous menstrual cycle. Serial ultrasonic evaluation of the endometrium and endometrial biopsy during the late luteal phase also was performed. Preliminary data indicated that transdermal E2 patches and vaginal P suppositories, while being as effective in inducing endometrial development for the embryo transfer procedure with donor ovum as synthetic steroids, can also provide a more physiologic approach that may conveniently and safely be extended into the second trimester of pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Although glycogen synthase is present in a highly inactivated state in hepatocytes from streptozocin-induced diabetic rats, glucagon, vasopressin, and vanadate are still able to further decrease the basal activity of the enzyme. This inactivation was observed with the low-to-high glucose 6-phosphate activity ratio assay. The inactivation of glycogen synthase occurred concomitantly with the activation of glycogen phosphorylase. When hepatocytes from diabetic rats were incubated with [32P]phosphate and then with the agents and when the 32P-labeled glycogen synthase was immunoprecipitated, we observed that the 32P bound to the 88,000-Mr subunit increased in all cases. All the [32P]phosphate was located in two cyanogen bromide fragments of the enzyme, indicating that the enzyme was phosphorylated at multiple sites. The fragments were precisely those phosphorylated by glycogenolytic hormones in hepatocytes from normal rats. These results demonstrated that hepatic glycogen synthase, although highly inactive, is under potential hormonal control in diabetes and that the enzyme has not reached its maximal level of phosphorylation. Furthermore, they indicated that vanadate behaves as a glycogenolytic agent regarding its effects on glycogen-metabolizing enzymes in hepatocytes from diabetic rats.\r"

An alternative combination was monoclonal antibody to S-protein and antiserum to C9. Submucosal vessel walls in both normal and diseased colon showed parallel positivity for C3d, C5, C9, terminal complement complex, and S-protein, but the staining intensity and the proportion of positive vessels were significantly higher in inflammatory bowel disease than in controls. In addition, there was significantly more C3c reactivity associated with the terminal complement complex-positive submucosal vessels of active inflammatory bowel disease lesions than in histologically normal colon. Vascular C activation may therefore be a continuous process in active inflammatory bowel disease lesions, presumably related to the degree of inflammation and immune complex formation.\r"

On the other hand, the median nucleation times of bile samples from 15 patients with noncholesterol gallstones and 24 patients without gallstones were 15 and 14 days, respectively. In addition, 3 mo of treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid significantly elevated the serum concentration of the antinucleating factor apolipoprotein A-I, from 133.3 +/- 12.3 to 148.6 +/- 13.2 mg/dl (p less than 0.05).

In ileum and proximal and distal colon, dithiothreitol, which increases mucosal permeability, increased peptide absorption and biliary recovery fourfold, 70-fold, and 20-fold over control values, respectively. When dithiothreitol was combined with d-l-benzyl succinate, a potent inhibitor of intestinal carboxypeptidase, absorption and biliary recovery from ileal loops increased markedly to 40-fold over control, whereas there was no further increase in absorption from colon loops. There was a strong correlation between biliary N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-125I-tyrosine recovery and intestinal absorption of 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetate, a marker of passive mucosal permeability (r = 0.97). We conclude that in the ileum both enzymic degradation and restricted mucosal permeability contribute to the intestinal barrier to luminal bacterial formyl oligopeptides. In the colon, however, enzymic mechanisms are less active and restricted mucosal permeability is the major factor. Abnormalities of the intestinal mucosal barrier to proinflammatory bacterial peptides could play a role in inflammatory disorders of the gut.\r"

  ".U": "89253776\r", 
  ".W": "Studies were carried out to determine if the release of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is altered in the inbred Dahl salt-sensitive (SS/Jr) rat. Isolated heart-lung preparations of prehypertensive young SS/Jr rats (6-8 weeks of age) and age-matched inbred Dahl salt-resistant (SR/Jr) rats were used. At this relatively young age the blood pressure difference between strains (SS/Jr, 108 +/- 3 mm Hg; SR/Jr, 103 +/- 2 mm Hg) was minor. ANF release was stimulated with preload-induced or afterload-induced atrial stretch. Increased preload produced increases in right and left atrial pressures that were equivalent between young SS/Jr and SR/Jr rats; increased afterload produced increases only in left atrial pressures, which again were equivalent for young rats of the two strains. At any preload-induced change in atrial pressure SS/Jr rat hearts released less ANF than those of SR/Jr rats. Similarly, at any afterload-induced increase in left atrial pressure, SS/Jr rat hearts released less ANF than those of SR/Jr rats. In contrast to the above results in young rats, the strain differences were dramatically reversed when older rats (5-6 months of age) were used; at this age SS/Jr rats were markedly hypertensive (SS/Jr, 211 +/- 8 mm Hg; SR/Jr 130 +/- 4 mm Hg). Hearts from adult hypertensive SS/Jr rats released more ANF than hearts from adult normotensive SR/Jr rats at any left atrial pressure as afterload was increased. This reversal of SS/Jr rats from hyposecreters to hypersecreters of ANF is probably a consequence of hypertension-induced changes such as cardiac hypertrophy and recruitment of the ventricles to produce ANF. It is concluded that the hyposecretion of ANF by prehypertensive SS/Jr rats may represent a genetic trait relevant to the pathogenesis of genetic hypertension and that this is obscured by adaptive changes in the heart as hypertension progresses.\r"

  ".W": "Properties of human atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) binding to the crude membrane fraction of rat kidney were studied using the ANF-radiolabeled receptor assay; the developmental change of renal ANF receptors in three age groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was also investigated with the methods of radiolabeled receptor assay and the quantitative approach of in vitro macro-autoradiography. Temperature and incubation time greatly influenced ANF binding capacities because of the degradation of radiolabeled ligand. Addition of 5 mM MgCl2 to assay buffer was useful for the stabilization of ANF specific binding. Scatchard analysis suggested that the crude membrane fraction of rat's kidney had a single binding site with the apparent dissociation constant of 0.55 nM. In the study of the developmental change of renal ANF receptor in SHR, systolic blood pressure of the SHR at the age of 5 weeks and 12 weeks was significantly higher than that of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, but there was no significant difference in blood pressure between SHR and WKY rats at the age of 3 weeks. Concerning the radiolabeled receptor assay of ANF, the apparent dissociation constant and maximum binding capacity in SHR were low in all age groups when compared with those of WKY rats. In the in vitro macro-autoradiographic observation, the specific binding of ANF was localized mainly in the renal cortex, and these binding patterns of SHR and WKY rats were the same in all age groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The cost-effectiveness of treatment for hypertension is positively related to the level of pretreatment blood pressure and to the level of success in achieving patient adherence to prescribed medical regimens. Opportunities to improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment include limiting treatment to patients with well-documented sustained increases in blood pressure, giving higher priority to the treatment of patients with diastolic blood pressures of 100 mm Hg and above, and relying on lower-cost medications if clinical responses to treatment permit. In patients with mild hypertension, a comparison of strategies for initiating pharmacological treatment that takes into account potential side effects as well as the costs of medications indicates a difference of $270/patient-yr between the least and most expensive alternatives. Whether the additional costs of more expensive treatment strategies are \"worth it\" depend on any additional health benefits actually conferred. Moreover, higher-cost strategies may have negative influences on patients' decisions to adhere to prescribed regimens or to continue in treatment. Cost is a particular problem for the treatment of chronic conditions like hypertension because of inadequate insurance coverage for medications, especially for the poor.\r"

Increasingly, economic constraints will shape policy related to health care and research. Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular condition, and despite low unit health care costs, the aggregate costs are considerable. However, the unit and aggregate costs of the complications of hypertension are fourfold greater and, in this economic perspective, aggressive approaches are warranted to prevent complications. Treatment and research strategies should be identified that could have considerable potential economic impact. Several strategies are suggested as a prospective guide to policy development. Economic considerations will be important and should be incorporated in the planning of hypertension care and research.\r"

Both polished and unpolished surfaces were studied in the scanning electron microscope and they showed that the mineral component of bone is composed of small rounded units about 10 nm across which are fused together to form larger spheroidal units roughly 100 nm in diameter. In the unpolished surfaces these 100 nm units are seen to aggregate to form columns approximately parallel to their neighbours and with numerous interconnections forming a continuous mineral phase. The polished sections also show the hydroxyapatite as a continuous phase of contiguous spheroids and the holes from which the collagen fibres were removed are clearly revealed. Lamellations in the surface are interpreted as resulting from adjacent layers of collagen fibres having orientations approximately perpendicular to each other.\r"

Fasting serum insulin levels decreased from 177 +/- 45 (+/- SE) to 123 +/- 43 pmol/L (P less than 0.01) and insulin release in response to 100 g oral glucose administration decreased from 223.0 +/- 29.2 to 55.6 +/- 7.9 nmol.min/L (P less than 0.002) after diazoxide administration. At the same time, serum total testosterone fell from 2.5 +/- 0.4 to 2.1 +/- 0.3 nmol/L (P less than 0.007), serum testosterone not bound to sex hormone-binding globulin fell from 1.9 +/- 0.3 to 1.4 +/- 0.2 nmol/L (P less than 0.01), and the molar ratio of serum androstenedione to serum estrone fell from 25.7 +/- 7.7 to 16.6 +/- 5.5 (P less than 0.04). Serum sex hormone-binding globulin levels increased slightly but not significantly from 13.2 +/- 1.0 to 21.7 +/- 4.1 nmol/L. Serum androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol, estrone, and progesterone concentrations did not change, nor did basal or GnRH-stimulated serum LH and FSH concentrations. These results suggest that hyperinsulinemia in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome may directly increase serum testosterone levels.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the roles of plasminogen activator (PA) and PA inhibitor (PAI) in human ovulation, we obtained follicular fluid and granulosa cells from individual preovulatory follicles of patients undergoing gamete intrafallopian tube transfer. The follicular fluid samples (n = 25) were analyzed for total tissue-type PA antigen, PA enzyme activity by fibrin autography, PAI activity, PAI type 1 (PAI-1) antigen, and PAI-1 mRNA. The follicular fluid of preovulatory follicles contained low levels of total tissue-type PA antigen (less than 1 ng/mL). Fibrin autography experiments indicated little or no detectable PA activity associated with free or unbound PA. The results of the PAI activity assay and PAI-1 antigen determination support the concept of a relative abundance of PAI compared with PA. Hybridization analysis was used to measure the relative amounts of granulosa cell PAI-1 mRNA. The levels of PAI-1 mRNA correlate with follicular fluid PAI concentrations in individual follicles. Taken together, these results support the idea that there is very little free, or active, PA in follicular fluid of human preovulatory follicles, but there is an abundance of PAI. Furthermore, PAI-1 produced by the granulosa cells may represent a major form of PAI in follicular fluid.\r"

  ".W": "We studied binding of T4 to the lipid-complexed apolipoproteins (apo) of high density lipoproteins (HDL), the major lipoprotein carrier of thyroid hormones in human plasma, and to lipid-free apoA-I. HDL isolated from fresh normal plasma by ultracentrifugation (density, 1.063-1.210 g/mL) was photoaffinity labeled with [3,5-(125)I]T4 and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two bands corresponding to apoA-I (28.3K) and apoC-II or apoC-III (8.6-9.2K) were seen, and their radioactivity decreased by 50-60% when labeled in the presence of 1 mumol/L T4. Photoaffinity labeling of isolated apoA-I also was demonstrated and was decreased 74% by 1 mumol/L T4, suggesting a higher affinity of the lipid-free protein for T4. T4 binding of isolated apoA-I was optimal at pH 7-8, reached a maximum after 1 h at 23 C, and decreased after incubation at 37 C. Scatchard analysis revealed a single T4-binding site with a Ka of 7.5 x 10(7) L/mol at 23 C, pH 8.2. The potency of T4 analogs as inhibitors of T4 binding to isolated apoA-I was L-T4 = D-T4 = triiodothyroacetic acid = L-rT3 much greater than L-T3 much greater than L-thyronine. The binding of T4 to apoA-I was reduced by known inhibitors of T4 binding to serum proteins (diclofenac = mefenamic acid = furosemide = 8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonic acid much greater than dilantin greater than heparin greater than barbital) and by lipids (unsaturated fatty acids greater than cholesterol = cholesterol esters = phospholipids greater than saturated fatty acids = diglycerides = triglycerides). We conclude that the binding of T4 to HDL is mediated by a specific interaction of the hormone with apoA-I and with apoC-II and/or apoC-III. Since the lipid constituents of HDL inhibit T4 binding to apoA-I, the HDL subfraction in plasma that carries most of the HDL-bound T4 should be one with a low lipid content.\r"
