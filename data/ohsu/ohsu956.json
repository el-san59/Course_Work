  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Candida albicans infection has been proposed to cause a chronic hypersensitivity syndrome characterized by fatigue, premenstrual tension, gastrointestinal symptoms, and depression. Long-term antifungal therapy has been advocated as treatment for the syndrome, which is most often diagnosed in women with persistent or recurrent candida vaginitis. METHODS. To determine the efficacy of nystatin therapy for presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome, we conducted a 32-week randomized, double-blind, cross-over study using four different combinations of nystatin or placebo given orally or vaginally in 42 premenopausal women who met present criteria for the syndrome and had a history of candida vaginitis. The outcomes studied were the changes from base line in scores for vaginal, systemic, and overall symptoms and in the results of standardized psychological tests. RESULTS. The three active-treatment regimens (oral and vaginal nystatin, oral nystatin and vaginal placebo, and oral placebo and vaginal nystatin) and the all-placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than 0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo. On average, the scores for systemic symptoms improved 25 percent with the three active-treatment regimens and 23 percent with the all-placebo regimen, a difference of only 2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, -3 to 7 percent). As expected, the three active-treatment regimens were more effective than placebo in relieving vaginal symptoms (P less than 0.001). All four regimens reduced psychological symptoms and global indexes of distress; there were no significant differences among the treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently, the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND and METHODS. We describe five patients with underlying neoplasms in whom painful mucosal ulcerations and polymorphous skin lesions developed, usually with progression to blistering eruptions on the trunk and extremities. Histologic examination showed vacuolization of epidermal basal cells, keratinocyte necrosis, and acantholysis. Immunofluorescence testing revealed atypical pemphigus-like autoantibodies in perilesional epithelium and serum from all five patients. We studied the antigenic specificities of the autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, using extracts of 14C-labeled human keratinocytes. IgG purified from the serum of one patient was passively transferred to four neonatal mice to test for pathogenicity. RESULTS. Immunofluorescence testing showed that the autoantibodies bound to the surface of tissues containing desmosomes, including complex and simple epithelia, and myocardium. An identical and unique complex of four polypeptides with molecular weights of 250, 230, 210, and 190 was immunoprecipitated by all serum samples. The 250-kd polypeptide comigrated with desmoplakin I (a protein found in the desmosomes of all epithelia), and the 230-kd antigen comigrated with the antigen of bullous pemphigoid. Cutaneous blisters, a positive Nikolsky's sign, and epidermal and esophageal acantholysis developed in all mice into which the autoantibody was injected. Electron microscopy showed epidermal acantholysis similar to lesions of experimentally induced pemphigus vulgaris. CONCLUSION. These five patients with cancer had a novel acantholytic mucocutaneous disease characterized by autoantibodies that were pathogenic after passive transfer. The autoantibodies from these patients reacted with an antigen complex composed of desmoplakin I and the 230-kd antigen of bullous pemphigoid and two as yet unidentified epithelial antigens. We suggest the term \"paraneoplastic pemphigus\" for this disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Exercise is a common stimulus of bronchoconstriction in subjects with asthma, who also have bronchoconstriction after inhaling the sulfidopeptide leukotriene D4 (LTD4). The purpose of this study was to investigate the importance of LTD4 as a mediator of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. METHODS. In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 12 subjects with stable asthma were treated intravenously with MK-571 (160 mg), a selective and potent LTD4-receptor antagonist, or placebo, 20 minutes before each of two challenges involving exercise at a level previously demonstrated to cause a fall of at least 20 percent in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). The two exercise challenges were separated by one week. The results of the challenges were expressed as both the maximal fall in FEV1 after exercise and the time to recovery from bronchoconstriction. RESULTS. Treatment with MK-571 attenuated exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in all the subjects. The mean (+/- SEM) maximal percent decrease in FEV1 after exercise was 25.2 +/- 3.5 percent in the subjects taking placebo and 9.2 +/- 2.5 percent in the subjects taking MK-571 (P less than 0.001). The mean percent inhibition for the entire group was 69.5 percent. The mean time to recovery after exercise was 33.4 +/- 4.0 minutes in the placebo group and 8.4 +/- 2.5 minutes in the MK-571 group (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. This study demonstrates that pretreatment with a potent and selective LTD4 antagonist markedly attenuates exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and it suggests that LTD4 is a major mediator of this type of bronchoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase catalyzes the metabolism of arachidonic acid to form products that have been implicated in the airway obstruction of asthma. We hypothesized that if products of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway are important in mediating this obstruction, then prevention of their formation should decrease the severity of an induced asthmatic response. METHODS. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we examined the effect of A-64077, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, on the bronchoconstriction induced by hyperventilation of cold, dry air in 13 patients with asthma. The completeness of 5-lipoxygenase inhibition was confirmed by examining the profile of eicosanoids produced in whole blood ex vivo after activation with the calcium ionophore A-23187. RESULTS. A-64077 decreased the mean (+/- SEM) ionophore-induced synthesis of leukotriene B4, a 5-lipoxygenase product, by 74 percent (from 265.3 +/- 30.3 to 69.5 +/- 21.5 ng per milliliter, P less than 0.001), but it did not affect the ionophore-induced synthesis of thromboxane B2, a cyclooxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid (80.0 +/- 17.1 ng per milliliter before A-64077 vs. 75.8 +/- 14.3 ng per milliliter after A-64077). In concert with the selective inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase by A-64077, the amount of cold, dry air (expressed as respiratory heat exchange) required to reduce the forced expiratory volume in one second by 10 percent was increased by 47 percent after A-64077 (3.0 kJ per minute for placebo vs. 4.4 kJ per minute for A-64077, P less than 0.002). Similar results were obtained when minute ventilation was used as an indicator of outcome (27.5 liters per minute for placebo vs. 39.8 liters per minute for A-64077, P less than 0.005). CONCLUSIONS. Selective inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase by A-64077 is associated with a significant amelioration of the asthmatic response to cold, dry air, suggesting that 5-lipoxygenase products are involved in this response. This approach may be useful in the treatment of asthma.\r"

  ".U": "91061828\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The clinical importance of leukotrienes in human allergy has not been defined, in part because there have been no selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors that have been effective and safe for use in humans. To address the hypothesis that stimulated leukotriene synthesis causes symptoms of immediate-hypersensitivity reactions in vivo, I investigated the effects of a new 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, A-64077, on provoked allergic nasal symptoms and mediator release in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Eight subjects with allergic rhinitis underwent nasal challenge on two occasions after an oral dose of 800 mg of A-64077 or an identical-appearing placebo. RESULTS. Allergen-induced nasal congestion was significantly attenuated (P less than 0.02) by A-64077; peak levels of leukotriene B4 (median, 684 pg per milliliter) and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (median, 704 pg per milliliter) in nasal-rinse fluids were markedly reduced (to 67 and 185 pg per milliliter, respectively; P less than 0.01), whereas levels of prostaglandin D2 were not. Histamine release and sneezing were not reduced significantly by A-64077, but there was a significant correlation (P less than 0.01) between the changes in these variables within subjects. The mean (+/- SEM) stimulated synthesis of leukotriene B4 in whole blood ex vivo was markedly reduced by A-64077 (from 153 +/- 19 to 20 +/- 9 ng per milliliter, P less than 0.01), and the specificity of A-64077 for 5-lipoxygenase inhibition was verified by its lack of effect on the synthesis of serum thromboxane B2 or 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. CONCLUSIONS. These results provide direct evidence of an important role for the 5-lipoxygenase products of arachidonic acid in allergic rhinitis and support the notion that further experiments in this area may lead to new therapeutic approaches to allergic disorders.\r"

It is necessary to determine the predictors of these outcomes in order to focus efforts on prevention and treatment. Patients undergoing noncardiac surgery sometimes have postoperative cardiac events. It would be helpful to know which patients are at highest risk. METHODS. We prospectively studied 474 men with coronary artery disease (243) or at high risk for it (231) who were undergoing elective noncardiac surgery. We gathered historical, clinical, laboratory, and physiologic data during hospitalization and for 6 to 24 months after surgery. Myocardial ischemia was assessed by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, beginning two days before surgery and continuing for two days after. RESULTS. Eighty-three patients (18 percent) had postoperative cardiac events in the hospital that were classified as ischemic events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina) (15 patients), congestive heart failure (30), or ventricular tachycardia (38). Postoperative myocardial ischemia occurred in 41 percent of the monitored patients and was associated with a 2.8-fold increase in the odds of all adverse cardiac outcomes (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.9; P less than 0.0002) and a 9.2-fold increase in the odds of an ischemic event (95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 42.0; P less than 0.004). Multivariate analysis showed no other clinical, historical, or perioperative variable to be independently associated with ischemic events, including cardiac-risk index, a history of previous myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, or the occurrence of ischemia before or during surgery. CONCLUSIONS. In high-risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, early postoperative myocardial ischemia is an important correlate of adverse cardiac outcomes.\r"

Furthermore, sperm that have not passed through at least the head of the epididymis have been thought to be incapable of causing pregnancy. We attempted to determine whether human sperm that had never passed through the epididymis could fertilize eggs in vitro and whether the technique could be used for men with congenital absence of the vas deferens. METHODS. Twenty-eight men with congenital absence of the vas deferens underwent microsurgical aspiration of sperm from the epididymis and vasa efferentia for attempted in vitro fertilization of their wives' oocytes, with subsequent transfer of embryos. Thirty-two treatment cycles were begun (four were repeat cycles). RESULTS. The most motile sperm were found in the proximal epididymis, at or near the vasa efferentia. Embryos were obtained for transfer in 21 cases (66 percent). Ninety-three embryos resulted from 352 mature oocytes (fertilization rate, 26 percent). Clinical pregnancy was achieved in 10 of the 32 treatment cycles (31 percent). Seven women delivered normal infants, and three miscarried. One of the seven live births was of twins. There were six girls and two boys. When fewer than 10 eggs were retrieved, no pregnancy occurred. When 10 or more eggs were retrieved (20 cases), the pregnancy rate was 50 percent. CONCLUSIONS. Sperm from the proximal caput epididymidis and even sperm from the vasa efferentia (which have never passed through the epididymis) can fertilize the human oocyte in vitro and result in pregnancy with live birth.\r"

It has become the most common form of chronic lung disease in infants in the United States. The long-term outcome for infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia has not been determined. METHODS. We studied the pulmonary function of 26 adolescents and young adults, born between 1964 and 1973, who had bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infancy. We compared the results with those in two control groups: 26 age-matched adolescents and young adults of similar birth weight and gestational age who had not undergone mechanical ventilation, and 53 age-matched normal subjects. RESULTS. Sixty-eight percent of the subjects with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infancy (17 of the 25 tested) had airway obstruction, including decreases in forced expiratory volume in one second, forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75 percent of vital capacity, and maximal expiratory flow velocity at 50 percent of vital capacity, as compared with both control groups (P less than 0.0001 for all comparisons). Twenty-four percent of the subjects with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infancy had fixed airway obstruction, and 52 percent had reactive airway disease, as indicated by their responses to the administration of methacholine or a bronchodilator. Hyperinflation (an increased ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity) was more frequent in the subjects with a history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia than in either the matched cohort (P less than 0.0006) or the normal controls (P less than 0.0004). Six of the subjects who had bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infancy had severe pulmonary dysfunction or current symptoms of respiratory difficulty. CONCLUSIONS. Most adolescents and young adults who had bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infancy have some degree of pulmonary dysfunction, consisting of airway obstruction, airway hyperreactivity, and hyperinflation. The clinical consequences of this dysfunction are not known.\r"

But one component of glutamate release from neurons is calcium-independent, suggesting a non-vesicular release that may be due to a reversal of glutamate uptake. The activity of the electrogenic glutamate uptake carrier can be monitored by measuring the membrane current it produces, and uptake is activated by intracellular potassium ions. Here we report that raising the potassium concentration around glial cells evokes an outward current component produced by reversed glutamate uptake. This current is activated by intracellular glutamate and sodium, inhibited by extracellular glutamate and sodium, and increased by membrane depolarization. These results demonstrate a non-vesicular mechanism for the release of glutamate from glial cells and neurons. This mechanism may contribute to the neurotoxic rise in extracellular glutamate concentration during brain anoxia.\r"

Viral proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm require intracellular fragmentation and exposure to the class I antigens for the development of CTL responses. Although indirect evidence for binding of peptides to class I antigens has accumulated, direct binding has only been shown recently. The formation of complexes between peptide and class I antigen may occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and peptides have been shown to induce assembly of the class I complex. We have translated the messenger RNAs encoding HLA-B27 (subtype 2705) and beta 2-microglobulin in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with human microsomal membranes (to mimic ER membranes), in the absence and presence of a peptide derived from the nucleoprotein (residues 384-394) of influenza A virus. This peptide induces CTL activity against target cells expressing the HLA-B27 antigen. Here we report direct evidence that the nucleoprotein peptide promotes assembly of the HLA-B27 heavy chain and beta 2-microglobulin, and that this can occur in the ER immediately after synthesis of the two proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The testis-determining factor gene (TDF) lies on the Y chromosome and is responsible for initiating male sex determination. SRY is a gene located in the sex-determining region of the human and mouse Y chromosomes and has many of the properties expected for TDF. Sex reversal in XY females results from the failure of the testis determination or differentiation pathways. Some XY females, with gonadal dysgenesis, have lost the sex-determining region from the Y chromosome by terminal exchange between the sex chromosomes or by other deletions. If SRY is TDF, it would be predicted that some sex-reversed XY females, without Y chromosome deletions, will have suffered mutations in SRY. We have tested human XY females and normal XY males for alterations in SRY using the single-strand conformation polymorphism assay and subsequent DNA sequencing. A de novo mutation was found in the SRY gene of one XY female: this mutation was not present in the patient's normal father and brother. A second variant was found in the SRY gene of another XY female, but in this case the normal father shared the same alteration. The variant in the second case may be fortuitously associated with, or predisposing towards sex reversal; the de novo mutation associated with sex reversal provides compelling evidence that SRY is required for male sex determination.\r"

In the absence of this gene, ovaries are formed and female characteristics develop. Sex determination therefore hinges on the action of this testis-determining gene, known as Tdy in mice and TDF in humans. In the past, several genes proposed as candidates for Tdy/TDF have subsequently been dismissed on the grounds of inappropriate location or expression. We have recently described a candidate for Tdy, which maps to the minimum sex-determining region of the mouse Y chromosome. To examine further the involvement of this gene, Sry, in testis development, we have studied its expression in detail. Fetal expression of Sry is limited to the period in which testes begin to form. This expression is confined to gonadal tissue and does not require the presence of germ cells. Our observations strongly support a primary role for Sry in mouse sex determination.\r"

  ".U": "91061888\r", 
  ".W": "The primary decision about male or female sexual development of the human embryo depends on the presence of the Y chromosome, more specifically on a gene on the Y chromosome encoding a testis-determining factor, TDF. The human sex-determining region has been delimited to a 35-kilobase interval near the Y pseudoautosomal boundary. In this region there is a candidate gene for TDF, termed SRY, which is conserved and specific to the Y chromosome in all mammals tested. The corresponding gene from the mouse Y chromosome is deleted in a line of XY female mutant mice, and is expressed at the expected stage during male gonadal development. We have now identified a mutation in SRY in one out of 12 sex-inversed XY females with gonadal dysgenesis who do not lack large segments of the short arm of the Y chromosome. The four-nucleotide deletion occurs in a sequence of SRY encoding a conserved DNA-binding motif and results in a frame shift presumably leading to a non-functional protein. The mutation occurred de novo, because the father of the sporadic XY female that bears it has the normal sequence at the corresponding position. These results provide strong evidence for SRY being TDF.\r"

  ".W": "Why sex exists remains an unsolved problem in biology. If mutations are on the average deleterious, a high mutation rate can account for the evolution of sex. One form of this mutational hypothesis is Muller's ratchet. If the mutation rate is high, mutation-free individuals become rare and they can be lost by genetic drift in small populations. In asexual populations, as Muller noted, the loss is irreversible and the load of deleterious mutations increases in a ratchet-like manner with the successive loss of the least-mutated individuals. Sex can be advantageous because it increases the fitness of sexual populations by re-creating mutation-free individuals from mutated individuals and stops (or slows) Muller's ratchet. Although Muller's ratchet is an appealing hypothesis, it has been investigated and documented experimentally in only one group of organisms--ciliated protozoa. I initiated a study to examine the role of Muller's ratchet on the evolution of sex in RNA viruses and report here a significant decrease in fitness due to Muller's ratchet in 20 lineages of the RNA bacteriophage phi 6. These results show that deleterious mutations are generated at a sufficiently high rate to advance Muller's ratchet in an RNA virus and that beneficial, backward and compensatory mutations cannot stop the ratchet in the observed range of fitness decrease.\r"

Hsp60 belongs to a class of structurally related chaperonins found in organelles of endosymbiotic origin and in the bacterial cytosol. Hsp60 monomers form a complex arranged as two stacked 7-mer rings. This 14-mer complex binds unfolded proteins at its surface, then seems to catalyse their folding in an ATP-dependent process. The question arises as to how such an assembly machinery is itself folded and assembled. Hsp60 subunits are encoded by a nuclear gene and translated in the cytosol as precursors which are translocated into mitochondria and proteolytically processed. In both intact cells and isolated mitochondria of the hsp60-defective yeast mutant mif4, self-assembly of newly imported wild-type subunits is not observed. Functional pre-existing hsp60 complex is required in order to form new, assembled, 14-mer. Subunits imported in vitro are assembled with a surprisingly fast half-time of 5-10 min, indicative of a catalysed reaction. These findings are further evidence that self-assembly may not be the principal mechanism by which proteins attain their functional conformation in the intact cell.\r"

An independent domain of approximately 70 amino acids directs this sequence-specific DNA binding and is highly conserved between different receptor proteins and related transcription factors. This domain contains two zinc-binding Cys2-Cys2 sequence motifs, which loosely resemble the 'zinc-finger' motifs of TFIIIA. Here we describe the structure of the DNA-binding domain from the oestrogen receptor, as determined by two-dimensional 1H NMR techniques. The two 'zinc-finger'-like motifs fold to form a single structural domain and are thus distinct from the independently folded units of the TFIIIA-type zinc fingers. The structure consists of two helices perpendicular to each other. A zinc ion, coordinated by four conserved cysteines, holds the base of a loop at the N terminus of each helix. This novel structural domain seems to be a general structure for protein-DNA recognition.\r"

  ".W": "Metals dissolved in natural waters often become sorbed onto oxide or clay minerals, so that prediction of their chemical behaviour and transport properties requires knowledge of the structure and bonding of metal species at the solid/water interface. For many sorption systems, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) can be used to determine the identity and number of nearest-neighbour atoms and interatomic distances in aqueous complexes on solid surfaces, and thus to identify the dominant type of surface complex and the partitioning mechanism. Here we describe an XAS study of divalent cobalt (Co(II)) complexes sorbed on three different solids, gamma-Al2O3, rutile (TiO2) and kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4). We find direct evidence for the presence of multinuclear sorption complexes at surface coverages below one monolayer of Co(II) atoms. Our spectroscopic data reveal distinct differences in the number of coordinating atoms and interatomic distances in the surface complexes formed on each of the solids at the same sorption density. These results suggest that different oxide and clay surfaces influence the structure and properties of aqueous surface complexes, and therefore must be accounted for in models of metal-ion sorption.\r"

By contrast, activity-dependent modification of gap junctions, which also widely exist in higher structures such as hippocampus and neocortex, has not been described. Here we report that at mixed synapses between sensory afferents and an identified reticulospinal neuron, the electrotonic coupling potential can be potentiated, as well as the chemically mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential, for a prolonged time period using a stimulation paradigm like that which produces long-term potentiation in hippocampus. The effect on coupling is due to an increase in gap-junctional conductance. Our data indicate that the potentiation of both synaptic components requires an increase in intracellular calcium, involves activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, and is specific to the tetanized pathway.\r"

  ".W": "A molecular mechanism for selective axonal adhesion is a central question of neural development. Cell adhesion molecules have been identified, but it has been difficult to ascribe functions for these proteins in vivo. Here we show that the neuronal membrane glycoprotein fasciclin I has a role in the adhesion of sister axons during the development of the grasshopper limb bud. To do this we used a new technique, chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI), which causes the precisely timed thermal denaturation of specific proteins by laser light targeted through a dye-labelled antibody, without any other observable damage to living cells. This can be achieved by relaxation of the laser-excited dye which releases heat to denature the bound protein; the rapid dissipation of heat with distance insulates unbound proteins from damage. CALI is a molecular analogue of cellular laser ablation and provides an unprecedented level of spatial and temporal resolution. Using dye-labelled antibodies that recognize fasciclin I, CALI disrupts fasciculation of the pioneer neurons without affecting their growth or guidance.\r"

  ".W": "About five out of 1,000 patients admitted to hospital develop bacterial sepsis leading to shock, the mortality rate for which is high despite antibiotic therapy. The infection results in hypotension and poor tissue perfusion, and eventually leads to the failure of several organ systems. Bacterial endotoxin is thought to be the direct cause of shock in Gram-negative sepsis, because it can cause shock in animals, and antibodies against endotoxin prevent Gram-negative shock in animals and in humans. But, the symptoms of septic shock are the result of the actions of host cytokines induced by the endotoxin. The cytokine interleukin-1 has been implicated as an important mediator of septic shock because it can induce tachycardia and hypotension and act synergistically with tumour necrosis factor to cause tissue damage and death. We now report that a specific interleukin-1 receptor antagonist reduces the lethality of endotoxin-induced shock in rabbits, indicating that interleukin-1 does indeed play an important part in endotoxin shock.\r"

Soluble antibody fragments secreted from bacteria are then screened for binding activities. Screening of V genes would, however, be revolutionized if they could be expressed on the surface of bacteriophage. Phage carrying V genes that encode binding activities could then be selected directly with antigen. Here we show that complete antibody V domains can be displayed on the surface of fd bacteriophage, that the phage bind specifically to antigen and that rare phage (one in a million) can be isolated after affinity chromatography.\r"

Recognition of the potential therapeutic benefit of controlling unabated capillary growth has led to a search for safe and effective angiogenesis inhibitors. We report here the synthesis of a family of novel inhibitors that are analogues of fumagillin, a naturally secreted antibiotic of Aspergillus fumigatus fresenius. We first isolated this fungus from a contaminated culture of capillary endothelial cells. Purified fumagillin inhibited endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and tumour-induced angiogenesis in vivo; it also inhibited tumour growth in mice, but prolonged administration was limited because it caused severe weight loss. Synthesis of fumagillin analogues yielded potent angiogenesis inhibitors ('angioinhibins') which suppress the growth of a wide variety of tumours with relatively few side-effects.\r"

  ".U": "91061915\r", 
  ".W": "The T lymphocyte surface protein CD4 is an integral membrane glycoprotein noncovalently associated with the tyrosine protein kinase p56lck. In normal T cells, surface association of CD4 molecules with other CD4 molecules or other T-cell surface proteins, such as the T-cell antigen receptor, stimulates the activity of the p56lck tyrosine kinase, resulting in the phosphorylation of various cellular proteins at tyrosine residues. Thus, the signal transduction in T cells generated through the surface engagement of CD4 is similar to that observed for the class of growth factor receptors possessing endogenous tyrosine kinase activity. As CD4 is also the cellular receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), binding of the virus or gp120 (the virus surface protein responsible for specific CD4+ T-cell association) could mimic the types of immunological interactions that have previously been found to stimulate p56lck and trigger T-cell activation pathways. We have evaluated this possibility and report here that binding of HIV-1 or the virus glycoprotein gp120 to CD4+ human T cells fails to elicit detectable p56lck-dependent tyrosine kinase activation and signalling, alterations in the composition of cellular phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, or changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration.\r"

Although the current number of families is still small, the correlation of clinical phenotype and molecular genotype supports 2 observations. First, SMA mutations at the 5q locus present with a broad continuum of clinical abnormalities, and 2nd, the single clearly unlinked family presents with an unusual phenotype characterized by relatively late onset and early death. Thus, there are as yet no unambiguous cases of typical SMA families that are clearly unlinked to the locus at 5q-ie, no clear cases of nonallelic heterogeneity. Analysis of SMA 5q families supports the view that, with certain exceptions, there is little phenotypic intrafamilial variability. When families were ranked by severity of disease there was a strong correlation with age of onset. Onset within the 1st few months was associated with early death, but not in all cases. With rare exception, onset after 1 year of age was associated with less severe disease and greater longevity.\r"

We then compared the nature and lateralization of the MRI abnormalities with the pathologic diagnosis and the side of lobectomy. The MRI criteria of hippocampal sclerosis were an increased T2-weighted signal and the signal's confinement to a unilaterally small hippocampus. Imaging was performed in coronal and axial planes, specially orientated along and perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampal body. We found diagnostic MRI abnormalities in 25 of the 27 cases with pathologically proven hippocampal sclerosis (sensitivity 93%, specificity 86%). In addition, we detected all 13 foreign tissue lesions on MRI. Overall, we detected lateralized lesions on MRI that correctly predicted the side of the epileptogenic temporal lobe in 72 cases (89%), with 2 possible errors. A learning effect in appreciating the relatively subtle MRI changes of hippocampal sclerosis was apparent in our later cases, as shown by an improved correlation between the 2 observers. This study demonstrates that hippocampal sclerosis can be identified on MRI with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.\r"

Brain CT and MRI showed diffuse symmetric leukoencephalopathy, even before neurologic symptoms. There were relatively normal EEGs. The visual evoked responses (P100) were either absent or delayed early in the course. The brainstem auditory evoked responses showed milder abnormalities, with loss of later components before the earlier ones. Deficient aspartoacylase activity in cultured fibroblasts or brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in all patients.\r"

Neuropathologically, both patients showed severe neuronal loss and reactive gliosis in the substantia nigra. Neurochemical studies showed a marked depletion of dopamine in substantia nigra, putamen, and caudate nucleus, as well as reduction in serotonin content in the substantia nigra. Glutamate contents were low in frontal cortex and thalamus, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) contents were low in thalamus and substantia nigra of both patients. In addition, phosphoethanolamine contents were reduced in all brain regions of both patients, especially in the substantia nigra. One patient with severe symptoms had low levels of homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and GABA in his CSF repeatedly for 3 years before death (aged 58), while the 2nd patient died (aged 51) of an unrelated cause before developing any symptoms of the familial disorder. Because brain deficiencies of multiple neurotransmitters appear to be involved, this disorder is unlikely to respond to treatment; however, neurochemical studies of CSF may make presymptomatic diagnosis feasible.\r"

We measured force and 31phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectra from the tibialis anterior (a slow-contracting, fatigue resistant, postural leg muscle) during a sustained maximum contraction (anaerobic exercise) and during intermittent contractions (aerobic exercise). We observed similar relationships between the decline in muscle force during fatigue and changes in both phosphate and hydrogen ion concentrations during both aerobic and anaerobic exercise in tibialis anterior. Furthermore, these relationships were similar to those previously observed in the adductor pollicis. The demonstration of constant relationships between muscle contraction force and metabolism under different exercise conditions and in muscles of different function supports the view that both phosphate and hydrogen ions are important regulatory factors in the fatigue of human muscle.\r"

The growth this field has undergone in recent years would not have been possible had it not been for key advances in the fields of cell biology, immunology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Nowhere has this been more evident than in the description of HIV as the etiologic agent of AIDS. In the relatively short time since the disease was initially described, the agent responsible has been isolated, much of its complex biology has been defined, and a drug that helps combat it has been licensed for use. The rapidity with which these events have transpired is largely unprecedented. There remain many unanswered questions regarding HIV and AIDS, and there still is no effective vaccine or cure. Significant questions regarding the immune response to HIV and the HIV response to immune or chemotherapeutic challenge, the establishment and maintenance of HIV latency, and the all-important mechanisms of HIV cytopathicity remain unanswered. It is clear that HIV offers no easy answers, and that significant work remains to be done before death from AIDS can be halted.\r"

AIDS remains a lethal disease with no effective cure. A great deal of information has been learned in the past decade, yet many questions remain unresolved. Much more research is needed into the conditions surrounding the perinatal transmission of HIV. Many women who give birth to a child with AIDS are themselves asymptomatic for HIV infection during pregnancy and at delivery; thus, routine voluntary prenatal HIV screening programs must be instituted in areas of high seroprevalence. Such screening programs must provide pretest and post-test counseling with consent and confidentiality. Seroprevalence studies conducted during the perinatal period or at birth using newborn blood samples will provide important epidemiologic data for further research investigations as well as continued estimates of the prevalence of HIV infection. Currently, there is no formal reporting system for HIV infection, only for the clinical expression of AIDS. There may be a need to develop a centralized reporting unit for HIV infection. As the epidemic continues and the true prevalence rates are determined, additional resources for public health care, housing, insurance, and foster care for children will be needed. The number of women who are infected is increasing at an alarming rate. Every opportunity to increase public awareness about the AIDS epidemic and modes of transmission must be exploited if we are to impact on the spread of HIV infection. Prospective studies of pregnant HIV-positive women and pediatric follow-up can provide a wealth of data about AIDS and disease progression in both the mother and the infant. Even if some children do not develop AIDS, the possibility of permanent effects of in utero exposure to the virus still exists. At what exact point in gestation does infection occur? Can infection be prevented or delayed with current chemotherapeutic protocols? Even if a cure or vaccine is developed in the near future, the impact of this deadly virus will have repercussions for many years to come.\r"

Numerous other immune functions are directly or indirectly impaired, including the function of CD8+ T cells and decreases in total lymphocytes, IL-2 secretion, IL-2R expression, proliferative response to mitogens, NK activity, ADCC, and several other measures. Immune alterations seen in normal pregnancy include decreases in CD4 and T cells, the proliferative response to mitogen, IL-2 secretion, and NK activity. These changes are largely cellular and usually are not apparent clinically. Normal pregnant women are immunocompetent. When pregnancy is complicated by asymptomatic HIV infection, the obstetric outcome does not seem to be adversely affected. Preliminary studies show that the course of HIV disease may not be adversely affected in these women, but this matter is the subject of intense investigation.\r"

Paroxetine was given as a fixed dose of 40 mg/day, while the dose of imipramine was adjusted to yield optimal plasma levels of imipramine plus desipramine of 400-600 nM. Paroxetine significantly reduced the symptoms of neuropathy as measured by both observer- and self-rating, but was somewhat less effective than imipramine. However, patients showing a weaker response to paroxetine than to imipramine had lower plasma concentrations of paroxetine than patients with similar response to the 2 drugs. On imipramine 5 patients dropped out because of intolerable side effects and 4 of 19 patients completing the study reported withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing imipramine. On paroxetine no patients dropped out due to side effects and no withdrawal symptoms were reported. Self-rating showed no depressive symptoms at baseline, and no changes during the study. Neither paroxetine nor imipramine caused changes in objective measures of peripheral nerve function. In conclusion, 40 mg paroxetine/day significantly reduced the symptoms in peripheral diabetic neuropathy, and it was suggested that by dose adjustment on the basis of drug level monitoring, paroxetine may become as effective as imipramine. Paroxetine was devoid of the often disturbing autonomic side effects limiting the use of imipramine in several patients.\r"

Seventeen descriptors of the 61 QDSA descriptors have a significant intergroup frequency difference. By principal component analysis and Varimax rotation of the intercorrelation matrix of descriptors in the neuropathic group. 7 factors accounting for 66.0% of the total variance are derived. Six factors reflect purely sensory or affective aspects of the pain experience. Seven descriptors from the discriminant analysis function correctly assign 77% of neuropathic pain patients and 81% of the non-neuropathic pain patients. In a second neuropathic pain group of 32 patients, the discriminant function coefficient permits correct diagnostic categorization in 66% of the cases. Implications for clinical practice and trials are discussed.\r"

Two hundred and two patients were classified, according to the diagnostic criteria of Eversole and Machado, as either myogenic facial pain (n = 42), internal derangement type I (n = 69), internal derangement type II (n = 85), or internal derangement type III (n = 6). Patients completed the Basic Personality Inventory, the Illness Behavior Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Ways of Coping Checklist. Subjects also answered question pertaining to TMJPD symptomatology, including chronicity and severity. After conservative treatment with simple jaw exercise and ultrasound, patients were contacted again at 5 months to complete follow-up questionnaires similar to those previously completed. Comparison groups were comprised of 79 patients attending outpatient physiotherapy clinics for pain-related injuries not involving the temporomandibular joint and 71 pain-free, healthy students. Data were analyzed using multivariate statistics. The results indicate a significant relationship between pain intensity (and to some extent chronicity) and diverse measures of personality among the pain controls but not among the TMJPD patients. This calls into question the validity of assuming individual pain disorders are subsets of a larger, homogenous pain disorder population. TMJPD patients and pain controls score higher on hypochondriasis and anxiety than the pain-free controls but these elevations are not clinically significant. The elevations decrease to normal levels in response to a positive treatment outcome. There were no differences between the TMJPD patients and the pain controls on any of the measures. These results suggests that TMJPD patients do not appear to be significantly different from other pain patients or healthy controls in personality type, response to illness, attitudes towards health care, or ways of coping with stress.\r"

Although there appears to be some consensus among physicians as to the potential utility of examination and diagnostic tests frequently used to evaluate chronic pain patients, little attention has been paid to the reliability of interpreting the results of these procedures. Moreover, the integration of biomedical findings to form a general index of pathology associated with chronic pain has been a difficult problem to solve because not all biomedical procedures used to evaluate pain patients are necessarily relevant or indicated for a specific patient. Two studies are presented that were designed to evaluate the reliability of 23 biomedical procedures commonly used to evaluate chronic pain patients and to determine if findings on these procedures can effectively be combined to form a reliable index of physical pathology. The results of study 1 suggest that 17 of the 23 procedures can be applied in clinical setting with acceptable levels of reliability. Study 2 provides evidence that an innovative weighted scoring approach, based on current medical consensus, can be used to produce a reliable, general index of pathology that is independent of the number of procedures used to evaluate patients. The utility of this quantification approach to biomedical findings for clinical and research purposes is discussed.\r"

A group of 163 chronic pain suffers in multiple settings was compared with 81 control subjects on measures of personal history antecedent to pain onset, as well as on measures of current emotional disturbance. In addition, these psychological variables were examined for their associations with subjectively rated pain intensity. Overall, pain was found to be related to more current depression and less current life satisfaction, but was not associated with most of the personal history variables examined. These results suggests that emotional disturbance in pain patients is more likely to be a consequence than a cause of chronic pain. The dangers of routinely ascribing intractable pain to psychological causation are discussed in the light of these findings.\r"

  ".W": "The lumbar and cervical spinal dorsal horns of adult rats with a chronic (8 days) constriction injury of the sciatic nerve on one side (and a sham operation on the other) were examined for signs of transsynaptic degeneration. The incidence of neurons with signs of degeneration (pyknosis and hyperchromatosis; 'dark neurons') was significantly increased in the lumbar dorsal horn on both sides. The ipsilateral lumbar increase was significantly greater than the contralateral increase. There was no increase in the incidence of dark neurons in the cervical dorsal horns of the same rats. The distribution of lumbar dark neurons was similar bilaterally. The majority of the dark neurons were found in the sciatic nerve's territory in laminae I-II. A second group of rats received the same surgery but in addition received a series of 7 daily subconvulsive doses of strychnine. Dark neurons were again found bilaterally (with ipsilateral predominance) in the sciatic nerve's territory in lumbar laminae I-II, but the incidence was significantly greater than that found in the group that did not receive strychnine. The same result was obtained in a third group of strychnine-treated rats when the sham operation was omitted. Thus the appearance of contralateral dark neurons is not dependent on unintentional nerve damage created by the sham procedure. An additional group of rats was sacrificed 8 days after receiving a unilateral sciatic nerve transection, a contralateral sham operation, and the 7 daily strychnine injections. There was no increase in the incidence of dark neurons in any of these rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of administering low doses (0.5-1.5 micrograms) of the mu-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl into the right brachial plexus sheath of the rat was examined using the vocalization threshold to paw pressure test. Both forepaws were tested in each rat. Fentanyl injected into the right brachial plexus sheath at 0.5-1.5 micrograms/kg produced a localized, dose-dependent, potent and long lasting antinociceptive effect, as gauged on the right forepaw. At the lower dose used (0.5 microgram/kg of fentanyl), the antinociceptive effect was restricted to the right forepaw and lasted for more than 2 h. Increasing doses of fentanyl (1 and 1.5 micrograms/kg) induced potent effects, lasting up to 5-6 h or even longer. In complete contrast, fentanyl administered i.v. at the dose of 1 microgram/kg had a very transient effect, only lasting up to 25 min. The results of injection of low doses of the opioid antagonist naloxone when administered either i.v. or locally into the paw, on the effect of fentanyl suggest the involvement of a peripheral site of action of the opioid. The present findings suggest that, as already observed in patients in clinical situations, low doses of opiates delivered using this administration route may provide prolonged regional analgesia, with the potential of avoiding centrally mediated side effects.\r"

  ".W": "Single unit recordings were made in the lumbar dorsal horn in the intact anaesthetized rat from convergent, multireceptive neurones. Activity was evoked by A beta and C fibre transcutaneous electrical stimulation of hind paw receptive fields. Three opioids, fentanyl, etorphine and buprenorphine were applied either intrathecally or intravenously and their effects on neuronal responses were examined. Intrathecal fentanyl and etorphine produced clear selective naloxone-reversible inhibitions of C fibre-evoked responses (ED50 = 24 micrograms and 0.6 micrograms respectively). Fentanyl, a mu opioid receptor agonist, was more potent at a given dose when given systemically, but etorphine, a non-selective opioid agonist, was similarly potent by both routes. In contrast to fentanyl and etorphine, intrathecal buprenorphine produced facilitations of C fibre-evoked responses at a low dose (15 micrograms), but inhibited both C and A beta fibre-evoked responses equally at a higher dose (125 micrograms). Inhibitions were found to be irreversible by naloxone. No inhibition of either C or A beta responses occurred following intravenous buprenorphine (10-1070 micrograms). The results are discussed in the light of the relationships between lipophilicity, opioid receptor selectivity and potency for spinally applied opioids.\r"

Subcutaneous formalin injection induces 2 distinct periods of high licking activity: an early phase lasting the first 5 min, and a late phase lasting 20-30 min after the injection. Formalin concentrations of 0.02-0.2% induced only the early phase, while concentrations of 1% or more induced both the early phase and the late phase. The ability of the test to show the antinociceptive effect of morphine and acetylsalicylic acid was similar for high and low formalin concentrations. For both these analgesics, a lower dose was needed to induce antinociception in the late phase than in the early phase using the same formalin concentration. Indomethacin had no effect in the early phase. In the late phase indomethacin induced antinociception when 1% formalin was used, while no significant effect was observed using 5% formalin. Clear histological changes in the paw were demonstrated after formalin concentrations that induced both phases. Lower formalin concentrations induced only very small changes. Using a low formalin concentration (0.2%), repeated testing using the same paw could be performed at intervals of 1 week without any significant change in the response. It was concluded that the formalin concentration should be kept as low as possible to minimize the suffering of the animal. Formalin concentrations of 0.05-0.2% are recommended for studying the early phase. Formalin concentrations of 1% or higher have to be used when studying the nociceptive response in the late phase.\r"

Attempts to demonstrate and identify specific psychophysiological mechanisms have, so far, been unsatisfactory. Methodological problems in inducing pain and monitoring physiological responses may be the reason for this lack of success. In the present study, we have attempted to eliminate some of these methodological problems. The sensory and pain thresholds to laser stimulation were determined, and the laser-evoked brain potentials were measured for 8 highly hypnotically susceptible subjects in 3 conditions: (1) waking state, (2) suggestion of hyperaesthesia, (3) suggestion of analgesia. The thresholds were reduced during induced hyperaesthesia and increased during analgesia. During hyperaesthesia sensations could be evoked by laser intensities which were below intensities that could be perceived in the awake state. The amplitude of the evoked brain potentials increased during hyperaesthesia and decreased during analgesia. The latency of the potential remained constant. The perception of pain during hypnosis can change very fast, indicating that slow endogenous mechanisms may play only a minor role in suggested hyperaesthesia/analgesia.\r"

These RNAs contain the Tat-responsive region sequence, which is capable of assuming a stem-loop structure and has been implicated in the regulation of both transcription and translation. It has been reported that Tat-responsive region RNA inhibits translation in vitro through activation of an interferon-induced protein kinase, the double-stranded-RNA-activated inhibitor, which phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2. We show that the activation property is due to double-stranded RNA that often contaminates RNA synthesized in vitro using bacteriophage RNA polymerases. After purification, high concentrations of Tat-responsive region RNA inhibit the activation of double-stranded RNA-activated inhibitor, suggesting that it may serve to protect human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection from a cellular defense mechanism.\r"

The WSXWS motif found in members of the newly identified growth factor receptor family was also present in the extracellular domain of the human G-CSF receptor. Expression of the cloned cDNA in monkey COS cells gave rise to a protein that could specifically bind G-CSF with a high affinity (Kd, 550 pM). Two other classes of the human G-CSF receptor were also identified, one of which had a deletion of the transmembrane domain and seemed to encode a secreted, soluble receptor. The third class of the G-CSF receptor contained a 27-amino acid insertion in the cytoplasmic domain and was highly expressed in placenta.\r"

However, almost all 2-amino acid insertions in the middle 600 residues comprising leucine-rich repeats and deletions in the COOH-terminal 66 residues completely abolished activation by the RAS2 protein, whereas insertion mutations in the other regions generally had no effect. Chimeric adenylate cyclases were constructed by swapping the upstream and downstream portions surrounding the catalytic domains between the Sa. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe adenylate cyclases and examined for activation by the RAS2 protein. We found that the fusion containing both the NH2-terminal 1600 residues and the COOH-terminal 66 residues of the Sa. cerevisiae cyclase rendered the catalytic domain of the Sc. pombe cyclase, which otherwise did not respond to RAS proteins, activatable by the RAS2 protein. Thus the leucine-rich repeats and the COOH terminus of the Sa. cerevisiae adenylate cyclase appear to be required for interaction with RAS proteins.\r"

The alloalbumins were classified electrophoretically into 17 types. The number of unrelated carriers for each type varied from 1 for several variants reported here to 103 for albumin B. The structural change in 8 of these types has previously been determined, and the amino acid substitutions in 3 additional types are reported here. Albumin Varese has a substitution, -2 arginine to histidine (-2 Arg----His), the same as that reported for proalbumin Lille; albumin Torino has the substitution 60 Glu----Lys; and albumin Vibo Valentia has the substitution 82 Glu----Lys. The ability to distinguish so many alloalbumin types by electrophoresis at several pH values indicates that similar substitutions at different sites produce variants with different electrophoretic mobilities. Except for chain terminations in two Italian variants, all the mutations thus far determined for alloalbumins are attributable to a single-base change in the structural gene, and there is a preponderance of transitions and purine mutations. Seven alloalbumins for which the structural change has been established have been ascertained only in Italy. Several of these are clustered in specific geographic regions of Italy, which suggests an origin through a founder individual. Other variants that occur worldwide are nonetheless clustered in geographic regions within Italy. In these cases an independent mutation probably occurred at a hypermutable site such as a CpG dinucleotide.\r"

Of these, four were found in spontaneous wx mutants (wx-B, wx-B1, wx-B6, wx-C4) and include exon sequences; the fifth is restricted to an intron and represents a restriction fragment length polymorphism of a nonmutant allele (Wx-W23). The deletions, which range in size from 60 to 980 base pairs (bp), cluster in a G+C-rich region of approximately 1000 bp that is capable of forming stable secondary structures. Most striking is our finding that all of the alleles have DNA insertions (filler DNA) of 1-131 bp between the deletion endpoints. For three of the five deletions, the filler DNA and sequences at the deletion termini appear to be derived from sequences near one deletion endpoint. A previously reported spontaneous deletion of the maize bronze gene (bz-R) also contains filler DNA. The association of filler DNA with maize deletion endpoints contrasts dramatically with the rarity of similar events in animal germ-line and bacterial mutations.\r"

  ".U": "91062355\r", 
  ".W": "Although hematopoiesis is known to originate in a population of very primitive cells with both lymphopoietic and myelopoietic potential, a procedure for enumerating such cells has to date not been available. We now describe a quantitative assay for long-term repopulating stem cells with the potential for reconstituting all hematopoietic lineages. This assay has two key features. The first is the use of competitive repopulation conditions that ensure not only the detection of a very primitive class of hematopoietic stem cells but also the survival of lethally irradiated mice transplanted with very low numbers of such cells. The second is the use of a limiting-dilution experimental design to allow stem cell quantitation. The assay involves transplanting limiting numbers of male \"test\" cells into lethally irradiated syngeneic female recipients together with 1-2 x 10(5) syngeneic female marrow cells whose long-term repopulating ability has been compromised by two previous cycles of marrow transplantation. The proportion of assay recipients whose regenerated hematopoietic tissues are determined to contain greater than or equal to 5% cells of test cell origin (male) greater than or equal to 5 weeks later is then used to calculate the frequency of competitive repopulating units (CRU) in the original male test cell suspension (based on Poisson statistics). Investigation of this assay system has shown that all three potential sources of stem cells (test cells, compromised cells, and the host) can under appropriate circumstances contribute to long-term hematopoietic regeneration, thus establishing both the competitive pressure of hematopoietic stem cells in the cotransplanted compromised population and in the host, and the need to use genetic markers to track the specific contribution of the injected test cells. Analysis of the frequency of CRU in test marrow suspensions that varied widely in their CRU content gave similar values when endpoints of either 5 or 10 weeks posttransplantation were used and when either recipient marrow or thymus was used to identify progeny populations. In addition, repopulation of marrow and thymus was found to be associated in most mice injected with limiting numbers of test cells. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that the assay is highly selective for a very primitive, totipotent, reconstituting hematopoietic stem cell and should therefore be particularly useful in future gene therapy-oriented research as well as for more basic studies of hematopoietic stem cell regulation and differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty alleles, 12 at Mendelian locus Rrn1 and 8 at locus Rrn2, control rRNA genes [ribosomal DNA (rDNA)] variability in barley. These alleles differ strikingly in their effects on adaptedness. In the present study, we determined variation in the copy number of 101 accessions of wild barley plants from 10 ecologically diverse sites in Israel and examined relationships between rDNA copy number and adaptedness. The average multiplicity of rDNA per haploid genome was 1881 copies and the average numbers of copies for Rrn1 and Rrn2 were 962 and 917, respectively. The total number of copies as well as the number of copies for Rrn1 and Rrn2 varied widely from plant to plant within sites and also from site to site. The predominant allele of Rrn2 had somewhat more copies on the average than the other alleles of this locus but differences between the predominant allele and other alleles of Rrn1 were not statistically significant. Overall, the results indicated that differing amounts of rDNA resulting from variations in copy number and/or number of subrepeats in the intergenic spacer region were not closely associated with adaptedness. This suggests that the high adaptedness of a few specific alleles results in large part from adaptatively favorable nucleotide sequences in the transcription units and/or the intergenic spacer regions of the favored alleles--i.e., that adaptedness in barley depends on the quality more than on the quantity of rDNA present.\r"

An attractive strategy to combat HIV-mediated pathogenesis would be to eliminate the initial pool of infected cells and thus prevent disease progression. We have engineered a replication-defective, conditionally cytotoxic adenovirus vector, Ad-tk, whose action is dependent on the targeted expression of the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase gene (tk), cloned downstream of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, in human cells expressing the HIV-1 transcriptional activator Tat. Infection of Tat-expressing human HeLa or Jurkat cells with Ad-tk resulted in high-level tk expression, which was not deleterious to the viability of these cells. However, in the presence of the antiherpetic nucleoside analog ganciclovir, Ad-tk infection resulted in a massive reduction in the viability of these Tat-expressing cell lines. As adenoviruses are natural passengers of the human lymphoid system, our results suggest adenovirus vector-based strategies for the targeted expression, under the control of cis-responsive HIV regulatory elements, of cytotoxic agents in HIV-infected cells for the therapy of HIV-mediated pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Recent advances in understanding the molecular genetics of common adult tumors have indicated that multiple genetic alterations including the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes are important in the pathogenesis of these tumors. Loss of heterozygosity is a hallmark of tumor suppressor gene inactivation and has been used to identify chromosomal regions that contain these genes. We have examined allelic loss in the most common tumor in men, prostate cancer. Twenty-eight prostate cancer specimens have been examined for loss of heterozygosity at 11 different chromosomal arms including 3p, 7q, 9q, 10p, 10q, 11p, 13q, 16p, 16q, 17p, and 18q. Fifty-four percent (13/24) of clinically localized tumors and 4 of 4 metastatic tumors showed loss of heterozygosity on at least one chromosome. Chromosomes 16q and 10q exhibited the highest frequency of loss of heterozygosity with 30% of tumors showing loss at these chromosomes. These data demonstrate that allelic loss is a common event in prostate cancer and suggest that chromosomes 16q and 10q may contain the sites of tumor suppressor genes important in the pathogenesis of human prostate cancer.\r"

After infection with tobacco mosaic virus, acidic and basic beta-1,3-glucanases are induced in the inoculated and virus-free leaves of the plant. An analysis of cDNA clones demonstrated that at least five genes for acidic beta-1,3-glucanases are induced after tobacco mosaic virus infection. Southern blot analysis indicated that the tobacco genome contains approximately eight genes for acidic beta-1,3-glucanases and a smaller number of genes encoding basic beta-1,3-glucanases. Genes from both gene families were cloned and sequenced. The basic isozymes contain a C-terminal extension that is cleaved off during their targeting to the vacuoles. This extension is absent in the acidic isozymes, which accumulate extracellularly. Northern blot hybridization showed that genes encoding acidic and basic beta-1,3-glucanases are strongly induced after tobacco mosaic virus infection or salicylate treatment of tobacco. The cloning of these genes is a first step toward the identification of regulatory elements involved in their coordinate induction.\r"

IFN treatment results in a rapid increase in [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding to intact cells, indicating an activation of PKC. In addition, inhibitors of PKC (H7 and staurosporine) block the induction of antiviral activity by IFN against vesicular stomatitis virus. PKC inhibitors also block the accumulation of IFN-stimulated mRNAs in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells and suppress the transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes. Activation of IFN-stimulated genes is mediated through a DNA response element that is necessary and sufficient for the transcriptional response to IFN. IFN treatment induces the appearance of several DNA-binding factors that specifically recognize the response element, and the appearance of these factors is suppressed by PKC inhibitors. This observation provides evidence that PKC activity is involved during IFN-stimulated signal transduction. Although activation of PKC appears to be required for the response to IFN, agonists of PKC activity alone do not turn on expression of IFN-stimulated genes.\r"

Earlier data showed that embryonic brain expresses an RNA transcript distinct from the adult form; however, the exact structure of this form was not elucidated. Here, transcripts expressed in the embryonic but not the adult brain were cloned and analyzed. These transcripts include an exon not expressed in the adult inserted into coding sequence. The embryonic exon contains a stop codon that is in-frame with the coding sequence. The exon is found in genomic DNA within the GAD gene where it is flanked by introns with conventional splice sites. On the basis of these structural data, we propose the hypothesis that, early in brain development, transcripts encoding a truncated form of GAD are expressed. The deduced protein cannot function as a decarboxylase because the stop codon in the embryonic exon occurs upstream of the binding site for pyridoxal phosphate, an essential cofactor. Thus, alternative splicing plays a crucial role in the pathway leading to the development of functional GABAergic neurons. The central nervous system-derived cell lines B65 and C6 express a mixture of the adult and embryonic forms of GAD mRNA. They therefore are useful clonal models of central nervous system cells in the early phases of differentiation.\r"

BF is a protein with a molecular mass of 28 kDa on reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE). The active material was purified to homogeneity by a combination of affinity chromatography, PAGE, and high-pressure liquid chromatography. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that BF is derived from the membrane TNF receptor. Purified BF blocks the lytic activity of recombinant human and mouse TNF-alpha and recombinant human lymphotoxin on murine L929 cells in vitro. However, BF inhibits the lytic activity of TNF-alpha more effectively than it does that of lymphotoxin. The BF also inhibits the necrotizing activity of recombinant human TNF-alpha when coinjected into established cutaneous Meth A tumors in BALB/c mice. The BF may have an important role in (i) the regulation and control of TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin activity in cancer patients, (ii) interaction between the tumor and the host antitumor mechanisms, and (iii) use of systemically administered TNF-alpha in clinical trials with human cancer patients.\r"

A single appropriately timed premature electrical stimulus applied perpendicularly to the wake of a propagating quasiplanar wavefront gives rise to circulation of self-sustaining excitation waves, which pivot at high frequency (5-7 Hz) around a relatively small \"phaseless\" region. Such a region develops only very low amplitude depolarizations. Once initiated, most episodes of reentrant activity last indefinitely but can be interrupted by the application of an appropriately timed electrical stimulus. The entire course of the electrical activity is visualized with high temporal and spatial resolution, as well as high signal-to-noise ratio, using voltage-sensitive dyes and optical mapping. Two- and three-dimensional graphics of the fluorescence changes recorded by a 10 x 10 photodiode array from a surface of 12 x 12 mm provide sequential images (every msec) of voltage distribution during a reentrant vortex.

The structure of the terminal restriction enzyme fragments of EBV revealed that HLP is a permissive infection without a predominant, detectable population of EBV episomal DNA. In RNA preparations from this uniquely permissive infection, EBV replicative mRNAs could be identified by Northern analysis; however, the virally encoded small nuclear RNAs, the EBERs, were not detected in most HLP RNA preparations. In situ hybridization detected EBER expression in very rare cells. These data indicate that unlike other viral small nuclear RNAs, the EBERs are not expressed during viral replication and must participate in the complex maintenance of latent EBV infection.\r"

Double-labeling experiments establish that precorrin-6x carries five C-methyl groups, which appear at C-1, C-2, C-7, C-12 alpha, and C-17 of the hydrogenobyrinic acid formed enzymically from precorrin-6x. This precursor of the corrin macrocycle is at the dehydrocorrin level of oxidation, has undergone ring contraction and extrusion of C-20, but still carries the acetic acid side chain at C-12. It is demonstrated that the conversion of precorrin-6x into hydrogenobyrinic acid specifically requires an NADPH-dependent reduction step.\r"

The hydroxyethylamine moiety, in place of the normal scissile bond of the substrate, is believed to mimic a tetrahedral reaction intermediate. The structure of the complex has been refined to an R factor of 0.146 at 2.4-A resolution by using restrained least squares with rms deviations in bond lengths of 0.02 A and bond angles of 4. The bound inhibitor diastereomer has the S configuration at the hydroxyethylamine chiral carbon, and the hydroxyl group is positioned between the active site aspartate carboxyl groups within hydrogen bonding distance. Comparison of this structure with a reduced peptide bond inhibitor-protease complex indicates that these contacts confer the exceptional binding strength of JG-365.\r"

The bovine type I and type II scavenger receptors are multidomain transmembrane proteins that differ only by the presence in the type I receptor of an additional, extracellular cysteine-rich C-terminal domain. The isolation of type I and type II receptor cDNAs from a murine macrophage cell line, P388D1, establishes the presence of mRNAs encoding both receptor types in a single cell. Their sequences are highly similar to the bovine cDNAs. Receptor type-specific cDNA probes map to a common locus on murine chromosomes 8, suggesting that a single gene encodes both mRNAs. The type I-specific scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain helps define a previously unrecognized family of remarkably well-conserved domains. Highly homologous SRCR domains (one, three, or four per polypeptide chain) are found in diverse secreted and cell-surface proteins from humans (e.g., CD5, complement factor I), mice (Ly-1), and sea urchins (speract receptor).\r"

Treatment with cycloheximide before cytokinin addition enhances the accumulation of these messages. In addition, the abundance of these mRNAs is influenced by auxin. We demonstrate that the mRNAs corresponding to the cDNAs in this collection display a variety of patterns of accumulation in the tissues of an intact plant. We also show that different cytokinins induce similar increases in message levels. However, analogs of cytokinin that are much less active in bioassays induce lower levels of message accumulation. Sequence analyses indicate that two of the cDNAs correspond to ribosomal protein genes. The remaining cDNAs are likely to represent previously undiscovered genes that function early in the initiation of plant cell growth and/or chloroplast development.\r"

  ".W": "The DNA in mammalian genomes is characterized by complex patterns of DNA methylation that reflect the states of all genetic activities of that genome. The modified nucleotide 5-methyldeoxycytidine (5mdC) can affect the interactions of specific proteins with DNA sequence motifs. The most extensively studied effect of sequence-specific methylations is that of the long-term silencing of eukaryotic (mammalian) promoters. We have initiated studies on the methylation status of parts of the human genome to view patterns of DNA methylation as indicators for genetic activities. In this report, analyses using both restriction enzyme--Southern blotting and the very precise genomic sequencing technique have been done. The genes for tumor necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta--in particular, their 5'-upstream and promoter regions--have been investigated in DNA isolated from human lymphocytes, granulocytes, and sperm. The results are characterized by a remarkable interindividual concordance of DNA methylation in specific human cell types. The patterns are identical in the DNA from one cell type for different individuals even of different genetic origins but different in the DNA from different cell types. As an example, in the DNA from human granulocytes of 15 different individuals (ages 20-48 yr, both sexes), 5mdC residues have been localized by the genomic sequencing technique in three identical sequence positions in the 5'-upstream region and in one downstream position of the gene encoding TNF-alpha. The promoter of this gene is free of 5mdC, and TNF-alpha is expressed in human granulocytes. The TNF-beta promoter is methylated in granulocytes from 9 different individuals, and TNF-beta is not expressed. In human lymphocytes, the main source of TNF-beta, the TNF-beta promoter is free of 5mdC residues. All 5'-CG-3' sites studied in the TNF-alpha and -beta genes are methylated in DNA from human sperm. In human cell lines HL-60, Jurkat, and RPMI 1788, the extent of DNA methylation in TNF-alpha and -beta genes has also been studied.\r"

However, another major type of HTLV, HTLV-II, has been isolated only sporadically, and little is known of disease associations, transmission routes, and risk factors for HTLV-II infection. Recent studies indicate that a high percentage of certain groups of i.v. drug users and blood donors are infected with HTLV-II. Seroepidemiologic studies have found an elevated rate of seroreactivity to HTLV among Guaymi Indians from Bocas del Toro Province, Panama. To identify the cause of seroreactivity among this unique population we used HTLV-II-specific polymerase chain reaction techniques to detect HTLV genetic sequences from blood leukocytes of three seropositive Guaymi Indians. The HTLV-II primer-amplified polymerase chain reaction products from two of these subjects were partially sequenced and matched published HTLV-II nucleotide sequences in both p24 gag (94% of 107 bases) and pol (98% of 112 bases) regions. A CD4+ T-lymphocyte line established from one of these same subjects produced HTLV-II-specific proteins when tested in antigen-capture and immunoblot assays, as well as mature HTLV particles. The demonstration of HTLV-II infection in this geographically and culturally isolated Central American Indian population without typical risk factors for HTLV infection suggests that HTLV-II infection is endemic in this population and provides an important clue to potential natural reservoir for this virus.\r"

Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned fragment demonstrated that the genes encoding the large (RbcL) and small (RbcS) subunits of the symbiont RuBisCO were organized similarly to the RuBisCO operons of free-living photo- and chemoautotrophic prokaryotes. The symbiont rbcL gene shared the highest degree of nucleotide sequence identity with the cyanobacterium Anabaena (69%) while the rbcS nucleotide sequence shared 61% identity with that of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Comparison with a 153-nucleotide partial rbcL sequence from a symbiont of the bivalve Solemya reidi indicated that the two symbiont sequences shared 85% sequence identity at the nucleotide level and 93% at the amino acid level, suggesting a relatively recent common origin. Escherichia coli transformed with a plasmid carrying the RuBisCO operon of the gastropod symbiont in the proper orientation for transcription from the plasmid lac promoter expressed catalytically active RuBisCO. The presence of enzyme activity suggests the proper assembly of the subunits of this deep-sea RuBisCO into the holoenzyme.\r"

  ".U": "91062377\r", 
  ".W": "The relationships between the activation status of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and secretory responses were analyzed in perfused rat gonadotrophs during stimulation by high extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]e) or the physiological agonist, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Increase of [K+]e to 50 mM evokes an on-off secretory response, with a rapid rise in luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion to a peak at 35 sec (on response) followed by an exponential decrease to the steady-state level. Cessation of K+ stimulation elicits a transient (off) response followed by an exponential decrease to the basal level. The LH response to high [K+]e is nifedipine-sensitive and its amplitude depends on membrane potential. There is a close relationship between the LH secretory response to high [K+]e and the amplitude of the inward Ca2+ current measured at 100 msec in whole-cell patch clamp experiments. In addition, the profile of the LH secretory response is similar to that of the response of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in K(+)-stimulated cells. In Ca2(+)-deficient medium, the effect of high [K+]e is abolished; subsequent elevation of [Ca2+]e during the K+ pulse is followed by restoration of the on response, but with reduced magnitude. Agonist stimulation during the steady-state phase of the [K+]e pulse or after repetitive stimulation by high [K+]e elicited biphasic [Ca2+]i and secretory responses with a significantly reduced plateau phase; conversely, K(+)-induced LH release was reduced in cells treated with desensitizing doses of GnRH. These findings indicate that depolarization-induced changes in the status of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels determine the profiles of [Ca2+]i and LH responses to stimulation by high [K+]e; the initial activation of dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels is clearly dependent on membrane potential, whereas their subsequent inactivation depends on increased [Ca2+]i. Such inactivation of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels also occurs during GnRH action and may represent an additional regulatory mechanism to limit the entry of extracellular Ca2+ during prolonged or frequent agonist stimulation.\r"

In a previous study, we mutated the UAG codon to UAA or UGA and demonstrated that both of these termination codons could be suppressed in reticulocyte lysates and in infected cells with the same efficiency as UAG. We now report the identity of the amino acids inserted in vitro in response to UAA and UGA in fusion products containing the gag-pol junction region. The results show that UAA, like UAG, directs the incorporation of glutamine, whereas UGA directs the incorporation of three amino acids, arginine, cysteine, and tryptophan. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating misreading of UAA as glutamine and UGA as arginine and cysteine in higher eukaryotes. Interestingly, although our protein synthesis system presumably contains other known UAG and UGA suppressors, these tRNAs did not suppress the termination codons in our experiments. Thus, it seems possible that the sequence surrounding the gag-pol junction not only promotes suppression but also helps determine which tRNAs function in suppression.\r"

Analysis of the results by means of dynamical cross-correlation coefficients for atomic displacements indicates that domain-domain communication is present in the protein in the form of a molecular \"cantilever\" and is likely to be involved in enzyme function at the molecular level. The dynamical structure also suggests information that may ultimately be useful in understanding and further development of specific inhibitors of HIV-1 protease.\r"

The present study examines the site(s) of LACI synthesis. In this study, cultured hepatocytes isolated from normal human liver were found to be essentially negative in LACI mRNA as revealed by Northern blot analysis using a full-length LACI cDNA as probe. The conditioned media from these cultures were also essentially negative for LACI activity. Similarly, poly(A)+ RNA obtained from normal human liver did not contain detectable LACI mRNA. In contrast, cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human lung tissue (rich in endothelium) both contained abundant amounts of LACI mRNA. Moreover, erythrocyte lysates and culture media from normal monocytes, lymphocytes, or neutrophils did not contain measurable LACI activity; these cells were also negative for LACI mRNA. Platelets, however, contained LACI activity. The likely source of platelet LACI is the megakaryocyte cell since a megakaryocyte cell line (MEG-01) was found to contain LACI mRNA and to secrete small amounts of LACI activity. Additionally, human vascular smooth muscle cells and lung fibroblasts were also found to synthesize only small amounts of LACI. From these observations, we conclude that normal liver does not synthesize LACI and that endothelium is the principal source of plasma LACI. The undegraded LACI synthesized by endothelial cells had a molecular weight of approximately 41,000.\r"

The first clone was obtained from a phage lambda gt11 library screened with antibodies directed against the major secreted isozyme. Its predicted amino acid sequence, deduced from the 1228-base-pair (bp) cDNA, revealed a 22-amino acid signal peptide and a 294-amino acid mature protein (Mr, 31,228). The second clone was isolated from a lambda gt10 library screened with oligonucleotides corresponding to the regions for acid/base catalysis and the fifth ligand of heme. This cDNA (1344 bp) encodes a protein (330 amino acids) with a mature peptide of 307 residues (Mr, 32,954). The two peanut peroxidases are 46% homologous. The estimated gene copy numbers of these peroxidases might be close to 1 or 2 per haploid genome. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of these peanut peroxidases with other known isozymes shows two already known regions of homology (the region for acid/base catalysis and the fifth ligand of heme). Moreover, some new characteristics appeared such as a glycosylation site identical in five of the seven isozymes, a putative antigenic determinant common to all the isozymes, and a region of the highest homology. A secondary structure prediction showed that it corresponds to a 16-amino acid helix linked to the next one by a long stretch of beta strands and coils and might represent a critical structural element.\r"

The SL is derived from a 90-nucleotide nonpolyadenylylated RNA (SL RNA), presumably by trans-splicing. Neither the SL nor the SL RNA share significant sequence identity with previously described trans-spliced leaders and SL RNAs in trypanosomatid protozoans or nematodes. However, several features, such as predicted secondary structure, trimethylguanosine cap, and potential Sm binding site, suggest similarities among SL RNAs in widely divergent organisms. Our evidence also indicates that the exon 3 acceptor site of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene can be spliced either to the SL by trans-splicing or to an upstream exon, 2, by cis-splicing. The presence of a SL sequence in S. mansoni, a member of the phylum Platyhelminthes, suggests that transplicing may be a common feature of other lower invertebrates.\r"

  ".W": "The exotoxins produced by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus are able to stimulate powerful polyclonal proliferative responses and to induce nonresponsiveness by clonal deletion of T lymphocytes expressing the appropriate T-cell antigen receptor V beta gene products. This paper examines the ability of S. aureus enterotoxins to modulate the responsiveness of human CD4+ T lymphocytes with defined antigen specificity. It was observed that certain S. aureus toxins were able to activate and induce anergy in hemagglutinin-reactive T cells expressing V beta 3+ elements. After exposure to S. aureus enterotoxins A, B, and D in the absence of antigen-presenting cells, the T cells failed to respond to their natural ligand presented in an immunogenic form, despite enhanced proliferation to exogenous interleukin 2. The S. aureus toxin-induced anergy was associated with modulation of T-cell membrane receptors; down-regulation of the T-cell antigen receptor was concomitant with enhanced expression of CD2 and CD25. Interestingly, CD28 was increased only on stimulation, suggesting this protein may be differentially expressed by activated and anergic T cells. These results indicate that bacterial toxins are able to induce antigen-specific nonresponsiveness in human T cells, the application of which may be relevant in the regulation of T cells expressing a particular family of V beta gene products.\r"

As predicted by the ribosome scanning model, the leader open reading frame decreases the efficiency with which the 5'-proximal gene is translated in vitro. Thus, systemic pathogenicity in this system may be determined by the efficiency of translation of a viral gene in vivo and is not determined by the primary sequence of the encoded protein.\r"

The results suggest that a protease activity encoded within NS2B and the N-terminal one-third of yellow fever virus NS3 is capable of cis-acting site-specific proteolysis at the NS2B-NS3 cleavage site and dilution-insensitive cleavage of the NS2A-NS2B site. Site-directed mutagenesis of the His-53, Asp-77, and Ser-138 residues of NS3 that compose the proposed catalytic triad implicates this domain as a serine protease. Infectious virus was not recovered from mammalian cells transfected with RNAs transcribed from full-length yellow fever virus cDNA templates containing mutations at Ser-138 (which abolish or dramatically reduce protease activity in vitro), suggesting that the protease is required for viral replication.\r"

Although bathoiodopsin produced at the temperature of liquid nitrogen or helium reverted to the original pigment (iodopsin) on warming (above -170 degrees C), the bathoiodopsin produced at physiological temperature decayed to all-trans-retinal and R-photopsin (the protein moiety of iodopsin) presumably through several intermediates. The absorption maximum of bathoiodopsin at room temperature was at 625 nm, a wave-length slightly shorter than that measured at low temperature (lambda max, 640 nm). The extinction coefficient of bathoiodopsin at room temperature was lower than that at low temperature and close to that of the original iodopsin at room temperature.\r"

Interestingly, some differentiated cell types, such as erythrocytes and platelets contain high amounts of phosphotyrosine. We analyzed tyrosine kinases expressed in the K-562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, which has a bipotential erythroid and megakaryoblastoid differentiation capacity. Analysis of 359 polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA clones led to the identification of 14 different tyrosine kinase-related sequences (JTK1-14). Two of the clones (JTK2 and JTK4) represent unusual members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene family, and the clones JTK5, JTK11, and JTK14 may also belong to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases but lack a close relationship to any known tyrosine kinase. Each of these different genes has its own characteristic expression pattern in K-562 cells and several other human tumor cell lines. In addition, the JTK11 and JTK14 mRNAs are induced during the megakaryoblastoid differentiation of K-562 cells. These tyrosine kinases may have a role in the differentiation of megakaryoblasts or in the physiology of platelets.\r"

In the present work the genes encoding chloroplast GAPA and GAPB from pea have been cloned and sequenced. The gene for GAPB is split by eight introns. Two introns interrupt the region encoding the transit peptide and six are found within the region encoding the mature subunit, four of which are in identical or similar positions relative to genes for cytosolic GAPDH of eukaryotic organisms. As opposed to this, the gene encoding pea GAPA has only two introns in the region encoding the mature subunit. These findings strongly support the \"intron early\" hypothesis and suggest that the low number of introns in the gene for chloroplast GAPA is due to differential loss of introns during the streamlining period of the chloroplast genome following the GAPB/GAPA separation. We deduce from this that eubacteria and chloroplasts contained GT-AG introns until relatively recently and that the duplication event leading to the genes encoding GAPB and GAPA and their respective transit peptides occurred in the chloroplast progenitor prior to the successive transfer and functional reintegration of these genes into the nuclear environment. These conclusions imply that GAPA/GAPB transit peptides are of eubacterial origin.\r"

It functions by inhibiting the enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34), that is required for the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonic acid. Since biosynthesis of both cholesterol and coenzyme Q (CoQ) requires mevalonic acid as a precursor, it was considered that lovastatin therapy would also result in a lowering of cellular CoQ levels. This study was conducted to determine whether lovastatin treatment does decrease CoQ levels and whether such decreases can be prevented by CoQ supplementation. Forty-five adult male Holtzman rats were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Controls were fed ground laboratory rat chow ad libitum. The other two groups were fed ground laboratory rat chow containing 400 mg of lovastatin per kg of diet ad libitum. One of the lovastatin-fed groups received CoQ10 (15 mg per kg of body weight) daily via stomach intubation. After 4 weeks, samples of heart, liver, and blood were analyzed for CoQ concentrations. Results indicated that CoQ concentrations in all tissues analyzed were decreased in lovastatin-treated rats. Lovastatin-treated animals that were supplemented with CoQ10 had blood, heart, and liver CoQ10 concentrations that approximated or exceeded those of control animals. It is concluded that lovastatin does indeed lower tissue concentrations of CoQ and that a return to normal can be achieved by supplementation with CoQ.\r"

  ".W": "Lovastatin is clinically used to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia and successfully lowers cholesterol levels. The mechanism of action of lovastatin is inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol from acetyl-CoA. Inhibition of this enzyme could also inhibit the intrinsic biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), but there have not been definitive data on whether lovastatin reduces levels of CoQ10 as it does cholesterol. The clinical use of lovastatin is to reduce a risk of cardiac disease, and if lovastatin were to reduce levels of CoQ10, this reduction would constitute a new risk of cardiac disease, since it is established that CoQ10 is indispensable for cardiac function. We have conducted three related protocols to determine whether lovastatin does indeed inhibit the biosynthesis of CoQ10. One protocol was done on rats, and is reported in the preceding paper [Willis, R. A., Folkers, K., Tucker, J. L., Ye, C.-Q., Xia, L.-J. & Tamagawa, H. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 8928-8930]. The other two protocols are reported here. One involved patients in a hospital, and the other involved a volunteer who permitted extraordinary monitoring of CoQ10 and cholesterol levels and cardiac function. All data from the three protocols revealed that lovastatin does indeed lower levels of CoQ10. The five hospitalized patients, 43-72 years old, revealed increased cardiac disease from lovastatin, which was life-threatening for patients having class IV cardiomyopathy before lovastatin or after taking lovastatin. Oral administration of CoQ10 increased blood levels of CoQ10 and was generally accompanied by an improvement in cardiac function. Although a successful drug, lovastatin does have side effects, particularly including liver dysfunction, which presumably can be caused by the lovastatin-induced deficiency of CoQ10.\r"

The oscillatory activity was not affected by anesthesia, but it was often reduced by tactile stimulation or self-initiated movements. Analysis of the spike trains suggests that the majority of oscillatory activity was intrinsically generated by the neurons. A neural model of texture analysis is offered based on a corticothalamic phase-locked loop. The newly identified oscillators play a key role in this model. The relevance of the model to physiological, anatomical, and psychophysical data, as well as testable predictions, are discussed.\r"

The predicted structure of the 5HT-dro receptor reveals two unusual features: (i) eight putative transmembrane domains instead of the expected seven and (ii) a Gly-Ser repeat that is a potential glycosaminoglycan attachment site. When stably introduced into mouse NIH 3T3 cells, the 5HT-dro receptor activates adenylate cyclase in response to serotonin and is inhibited by serotonin receptor antagonists such as dihydroergocryptine. The 5HT-dro receptor or closely related receptors might be responsible for the serotonin-sensitive cyclase that has been suggested to play a role in learning and modulation of circadian rhythm in a number of invertebrate systems.\r"

  ".U": "91062396\r", 
  ".W": "In the retinae of many vertebrates, there are classes of horizontal cell that probably utilize gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter. As with other amino acid transmitter agents, the postsynaptic action of GABA is thought to be terminated by uptake into neurons and glia surrounding the release site. The present study examined whether an uptake system for GABA could be detected in isolated skate horizontal cells by means of electrophysiological methods. Pressure ejection of GABA onto voltage-clamped horizontal cells produced an inward current that showed no sign of desensitization regardless of the GABA concentration. The dose-response relationship followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a half-maximal response elicited at approximately 110 microM. Nipecotic acid produced a similar current and reduced the responses to GABA when introduced in the bath solution prior to the GABA pulse. On the other hand, application of 500 microM muscimol or 1 mM baclofen, GABAA and GABAB receptor agonists, respectively, were completely without effect. The GABA-induced current was not blocked by superfusion with 500 microM bicuculline, 500 microM picrotoxin, or 500 microM phaclofen. However, the responses to GABA were abolished when the cells were superfused in Ringer's solution in which choline or lithium had been substituted for sodium, and were reduced when the extracellular chloride concentration was decreased from 266 mM to 16 mM. Current-voltage data showed a maximal response to GABA when the cells were held at or below their resting potential. At more depolarized levels, the inward current became progressively smaller until, near +50 mV, it could no longer be detected; over the range tested (-90 to +50 mV), the response never reversed into an outward current. These findings suggest that the GABA-induced currents in skate horizontal cells are mediated by an electrogenic uptake mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Site-directed mutants of Escherichia coli fumarate reductase in which each of the four N-terminal cysteine residues in the FrdB subunit, residues 57, 62, 65, and 77, was mutated individually to serine have been constructed, overexpressed, and investigated in terms of enzymatic activity as well as the EPR and redox properties of the iron-sulfur centers. In each case, the mutant contains a functional fumarate reductase in which all three of the constituent iron-sulfur clusters (i.e., center 1, [2Fe-2S]; center 2, [4Fe-4S]; center 3, [3Fe-4S]) have been assembled. The mutations affect the properties of center 1 only and demonstrate that the anomalously high redox potential of this [2Fe-2S] center is essential for optimal enzymatic activity. The results are consistent with cysteines 57, 62, 65, and 77 providing the ligands to center 1 but leave open the possibility of noncysteinyl coordination for the localized valence Fe(III) site of the reduced cluster. The implications of the results for the role of center 1 in the electron-transfer pathway and the valence localization of reduced center 1 are discussed.\r"

We have transfected the epithelial cell line T84 with an expression vector containing a mutant form of the regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Stable transformants that express this construct have reduced basal cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and do not increase kinase activity beyond the basal level of control cells in response to cAMP. Forskolin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and prostaglandin E2 each stimulate intracellular cAMP accumulation in both mutant and control clones; however, the activation of Cl- channels in response to elevated cAMP is blocked in mutant clones, indicating direct involvement of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In contrast, Ca2+ ionophores retain their ability to activate the Cl- channel in T84 cells expressing the mutant regulatory subunit, suggesting that activation of the channel by means of Ca2+ does not require the participation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These clones will be useful for further studies of the interactions between the cAMP- and Ca2(+)-dependent regulatory pathways in salt-secreting epithelial cells. They can also be used to identify the mediators of Ca2(+)-dependent Cl- channel activation in isolation from interactions with the cAMP second-messenger pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured fibroblasts from patients with familial hyperapobetalipoproteinemia (hyperapoB) were used to determine if a defect in lipid metabolism was present. Three basic proteins (BP I, BP II, and BP III) were isolated from normal human serum by preparative isoelectric focusing, preparative SDS/PAGE, and reversed-phase HPLC. The Mr and pI values of these proteins were 14,000 and 9.10 for BP I, 27,500 and 8.48 for BP II, and 55,000 and 8.73 for BP III. These proteins differed significantly in their content of arginine, cysteine, proline, histidine, serine, and methionine. BP I appears to be the same protein as acylation-stimulating protein, but BP II and BP III appeared different from acylation-stimulating protein and other lipid carrier proteins. BP I, BP II, and BP III stimulated the incorporation of [14C]oleate into lipid esters in normal fibroblasts, an effect that was time and concentration dependent. In hyperapoB cells, BP II markedly increased (up to 9-fold) the incorporation of [14C]oleate into cholesteryl ester compared with that in normal cells; in addition, there was a 50% decrease in the stimulation of triglyceride acylation and cholesterol esterification with BP I. No difference between normal and hyperapoB cells was observed with BP III. In summary, the identification of another serum basic protein, BP II, led to the elucidation of another cellular defect in hyperapoB fibroblasts, enhanced cholesterol esterification, which may be related to the precocious atherosclerosis and abnormal lipoprotein metabolism seen in hyperapoB.\r"

TAR RNA competed for complex formation, and TAR mutants exhibited up to 10-fold reduced affinity for Tat. Synthetic peptides containing the basic region of Tat bound selectively to TAR RNA and exhibited the same sequence requirements and similar relative affinities for mutant TAR RNA as the intact protein. These results suggest that Tat contains a small RNA-binding domain capable of recognizing TAR and implicate functional relevance for direct Tat-TAR interaction in transactivation.\r"

The results were compared to those for an analysis of 211 SUP4-o mutations induced by 254-nm UVC light. In each case, greater than 90% of the mutations were single base-pair changes but G.C----A.T transitions predominated and accounted for more of the mutations induced by UVB than UVC. Double substitutions, single base-pair deletions, and more complex events were also recovered. However, UVB induced 3-fold more tandem substitutions than UVC and nontandem double events were detected only after irradiation with UVC. Virtually all induced substitutions occurred at sites where the pyrimidine of the base pair was part of a dipyrimidine sequence. Although the site specificities were consistent with roles for cyclobutane dimers and pyrimidine-pyrimidone(6-4) lesions in mutation induction, preliminary photoreactivation data implicated cyclobutane dimers as the major form of premutational DNA damage for both agents. Intriguingly, there was a preference for both UVB- and UVC-induced mutations to occur at sites where the dipyrimidine was on the transcribed strand.\r"

  ".U": "91062409\r", 
  ".W": "Diabetes and aging are commonly accompanied by arterio- and atherosclerosis. Infiltration of the arterial subendothelial intima by macrophages/monocytes is an important early event preceding the development of atheromatous lesions; these macrophages are known to produce mitogenic factors in early atherosclerotic lesions. It has been previously shown that, over time, vascular matrix accumulates proteins nonenzymatically modified by advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs). In view of the fact that macrophages/monocytes have AGE-specific receptors associated with the expression of several growth factors, we investigated the possibility that AGEs mediate initial monocyte-vessel wall interactions that occur before overt formation of vascular lesions. This study demonstrates that (i) in vitro- and in vivo-formed AGEs are chemotactic for human blood monocytes, (ii) sub-endothelial AGEs can selectively induce monocyte migration across an intact endothelial cell monolayer, and (iii) subsequent monocyte interaction with AGE-containing matrix results in the expression of platelet-derived growth factor. These results support the existing hypothesis that in vivo-forming glucose-derived protein adducts can act as signals for the normal turnover of senescent tissue protein by means of the AGE-specific receptor system. Time-dependent glucose-induced deposition of AGEs on matrix proteins may promote monocyte infiltration into the subendothelium. Subsequent AGE-triggered macrophage activation and consequent elaboration of proliferative factors may normally coordinate remodeling but may also lead to the diverse pathogenic changes typical of arterio- and atherosclerosis in diabetic or aging populations.\r"

The beta-amyloid protein accumulates abnormally in the brain in Alzheimer disease and is neurotoxic to differentiated hippocampal neurons in culture. Nerve growth factor (NGF) increased the neurotoxic potency of a beta-amyloid polypeptide by a factor of approximately 100,000, which resulted in a reduction of the beta-amyloid neurotoxic EC50 from 0.1 microM to 1 pM. This potentiating effect of NGF was reversed by a monoclonal antibody against NGF and was not observed for a variety of other neurotrophic growth factors. Exposure of hippocampal neurons to very low concentrations of beta amyloid alone resulted in a marked induction of immunoreactive NGF receptors. Addition of NGF with beta amyloid resulted in the appearance of neurodegenerative changes in NGF receptor-positive neurons. The early and profound degeneration of hippocampal and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that occurs in Alzheimer disease may result from a neurotoxic interaction of beta amyloid with NGF.\r"

Several recent studies have identified aluminum as a potential, although highly controversial, contributory factor in the pathology of Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and dialysis dementia. For example, aluminum has been found in high concentrations in senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which occur in the brains of subjects with Alzheimer disease. However, a mechanism for the entry of aluminum (Al3+) into the cells of the central nervous system (CNS) has yet to be found. Here we describe a possible route of entry for aluminum into the cells of the CNS via the same high-affinity receptor-ligand system that has been postulated for iron (Fe3+) delivery to neurons and glial cells. These results suggest that aluminum is able to gain access to the central nervous system under normal physiological conditions. Furthermore, these data suggest that the interaction between transferrin and its receptor may function as a general metal ion regulatory system in the CNS, extending beyond its postulated role in iron regulation.\r"

FRG Y1 mRNA is present in oocytes, embryos, and all adult tissues examined, whereas FRG Y2 mRNA is found only in testis and immature oocytes.

This promoter element is found in both mammalian major histocompatibility complex class II and Xenopus germ-cell-specific genes. FRG Y1, FRG Y2, and a human Y-box binding protein are homologous and represent a distinct family of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins.

Thus, such a system allows a unique opportunity to analyze the genetic events involved in the conversion of low-grade bladder cancer, the vast majority of which are curable, to the high-grade life-threatening form of the disease. Since 5-10% of transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) have been shown to contain a mutated HRAS gene, and protein expression levels of all forms of HRAS have been correlated with TCC progression, we chose to study the contribution of the HRAS oncogene in bladder tumor progression. We evaluated the effects of transfection of normal or mutated HRAS genes into a human TCC, called RT-4, that behaves as a superficial noninvasive papillary tumor after transurethral orthotopic inoculation into athymic nude mice. We found that overexpression of either transfected normal or mutated HRAS genes converted RT-4 cells to express an invasive phenotype remarkably similar in nature to the clinical behavior of high-grade bladder carcinomas. These results suggest a role for overexpressed normal or mutated RAS genes in human bladder carcinoma progression, and highlight the importance of using orthotopic inoculation systems for evaluation of the contribution of oncogenes to malignant tumor progression.\r"

We have studied a series of mutants in the region of amino acids 42-49 of CD4 for their ability to bind gp120, to interact with class II MHC, to enhance T-cell activation, and to bind a panel of anti-CD4 antibodies. The mutation Q40P (Gln40----Pro) and the deletion d42-49 were found to disrupt most antibody epitopes in the V1 domain of CD4, suggesting major conformational changes, whereas mutants F43L, G47R, and P48S retained the binding of most of the anti-CD4 antibodies tested. The mutants d42-49, Q40P, F43L, and G47R lost both gp120 and class II MHC binding as well as the ability to enhance T-cell activation. In contrast, the mutation P48S affected neither gp120 binding, nor class II MHC binding, nor T-cell activation. We conclude that within this region the binding sites for gp120 and for class II MHC molecules overlap and that amino acids Phe43 and Gly47 comprise an intimate part of both binding sites. These observations are consistent with a three-dimensional model of the V1 domain of CD4 that was developed in order to understand the structural basis for binding to CD4.\r"

The animals were the female offspring of Geoffroy male and domestic female cats. In repeated studies of marrow from control animals (n = 5) or experimental animals prior to transplantation (n = 3), the percent of progenitors with domestic-type G6PD did not vary. After transplantation, the peripheral blood counts, marrow morphologies, frequencies of progenitors, and progenitor cell cycle kinetics returned to normal. However, abrupt and significant fluctuations were seen in the G6PD type of progenitors from each cat during the 1-1.5 years of observation. These data cannot be explained if there were either a large or constant population of active stem cells and thus imply, in a large-animal system, that hematopoiesis was maintained through clonal succession. A stochastic model was developed to estimate the numbers of active clones and their mean lifetimes.\r"

The functional immune response of monkeys to infection was similar (though not identical) to that of humans to infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In the sera of infected animals, neutralizing antibodies were found to be low or absent, and in particular there was no neutralization of the various isolates by homologous sera. There was no detectable antibody/complement cytotoxicity, though AGM sera were able to initiate antibody-dependent cellular cytolysis of infected cells in the presence of healthy effector peripheral blood lymphocytes. As in the human/HIV system, macrophages from AGMs are readily infected by SIVagm. Two possibly important differences between the AGM/SIVagm system and the human/HIV system are (i) the low immune response of the AGMs to the core protein of SIVagm and (ii) the significantly lower inhibitory effect of SIVagm proteins on the proliferation of AGM lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Many methods are available for gallstone dissolution, including oral bile salts; cholesterol solvents such as mono-octanoin or methyl tert-butyl either; and calcium or pigment solvents such as EDTA and polysorbate. Which of these approaches will be appropriate for an individual patient depends on the type of stones; whether they are in the gallbladder or the bile ducts; whether access to the biliary tree is available; the patient's age and general medical condition; and the availability of necessary expertise. In the US, both chenodeoxycholate and ursodeoxycholate are now available. Ursodeoxycholate is more expensive but appears to produce fewer side effects and may be more efficacious. These agents are most effective in thin women with small floating, radiolucent cholesterol stones in a functioning gallbladder. Only about half of the small subset of patients will experience partial or complete dissolution of stones within a year. Stone recurrence and the potential toxicity of long-term therapy are problems with this approach. Therefore, for most patients, cholecystectomy, either in the traditional fashion or using a laparoscopic approach (see article later in this issue by Gadacz et al), is the most cost-effective and perhaps the safest option. Intragallbladder instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether probably will be applicable only to a small subset of patients, and treatment is likely to be followed by a high recurrence rate. In patients with retained common duct cholesterol stones and access to the biliary tree, mono-octanoin therapy is advantageous in that it can be initiated as soon as cholangiography demonstrates no extravasation. In properly selected patients, a 90% success rate with this technique can be expected within 7 days.\r"

Stone-free rates of 40% to 60% at 6 months have been achieved in most reported series with minimal morbidity.

Contraindications include pregnancy, acute cholangitis, advanced cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, peritonitis, significant bleeding disorder, portal hypertension, and a prior major upper abdominal operation. The procedure does require experience and specialized training. It is guided by an endoscope, camera, and video monitor, and is performed through four cannulas. The gallbladder is dissected from the hepatic bed under observation on a monitor. The possible complications are bleeding, injury to the common bile duct, and technical problems, such as perforation of the gallbladder. The length of the hospital stay and the postoperative recovery time are markedly shortened compared with standard cholecystectomy. The procedure has an advantage over stone dissolution and biliary lithotripsy in that the gallbladder is removed, and additional or continued treatment is not necessary. This procedure offers sufficient advantages to the patient that it will likely become a standard for qualified abdominal surgeons.\r"

  ".W": "Gallstone pancreatitis is caused by transient obstruction of the ampulla of Vater by a migrating gallstone. Intraglandular activation of pancreatic enzymes occurs (by an unclear mechanism), and their entry into the circulation causes most of the local and systemic events of pancreatitis. The diagnosis is based on history and physical examination, an elevation of serum amylase above 1000 IU/L, and ultrasound and CT scans. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography can be used in less certain cases to confirm the presence of common bile duct stones. Because of the absence of an agent that can abort progression of the disease, therapy should consist of adequate resuscitation, nutritional support, and careful monitoring to detect early complications. In patients with mild pancreatitis, surgery usually can be performed within 48 or 72 hours of admission or as soon as symptoms and amylase levels return to normal. For patients with severe disease, endoscopic sphincterotomy is emerging as the therapeutic modality of choice. Elective treatment of the associated biliary disease should be performed during the same hospitalization after the acute phase of the disease has subsided.\r"

  ".W": "Cholangitis is an infection of the biliary ductal system that results from the combination of bactibilia and biliary obstruction. Choledocholithiasis has been the leading cause of cholangitis. However, in recent years, especially at tertiary referral centers, nonoperative biliary manipulations, often in patients with unresectable malignancies, have become the most common cause of cholangitis. As a result, the complete triad of fever and chills, jaundice, and abdominal pain, as originally described by Charcot, is now seen less frequently. Most patients still have leukocytosis and abnormal liver function tests, but many patients with indwelling tubes may develop cholangitis without significant jaundice. E. coli, Klebsiella species, and the enterococci remain the most frequently isolated organisms, and anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis are recovered in 15% to 30% of patients. However, Enterobacter and Pseudomonas species, as well as yeasts, are now being isolated more frequently from patients with indwelling tubes, who often have been treated previously with antibiotics. Computed cholangiography usually is necessary to determine the cause and site of biliary obstruction. In the majority of patients with cholangitis, cholangiography can be delayed until the patient has been afebrile for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours. Initial therapy includes bowel rest, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics. Many antibiotic regimens are now available to cover the gram-negative aerobes, the enterococcus, and the anaerobes that are likely to be causing the biliary infection. The combination of a penicillin and an aminoglycoside has been the gold standard. However, recent studies suggest that the newer broad-spectrum penicillins provide adequate therapy for these patients. Only a small percentage (5%-10%) of patients with toxic cholangitis require emergency biliary decompression. The choice of percutaneous or endoscopic drainage should be made on the basis of the presumed site and cause of obstruction as well as local expertise. The nature of the biliary obstruction may be the most important determinant of outcome. At present, patients with end-stage malignant obstruction account for most of the deaths, whereas approximately 95% of patients survive an episode of cholangitis.\r"

However, the biliary surgeon must resist the temptation to do less than a thorough removal of all stones at the operation lest the patient be subjected to additional procedures, which carry their own risks of morbidity and death. The goal should be to clear the stones from the biliary system with the fewest procedures offering the lowest morbidity and mortality risks to the patient.\r"

The defect is secondary to inflammation and fibrosis from the chronic passage of gallstones, episodes of acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, peptic ulcer disease, and cholesterolosis. Patients with papillary stenosis from gallstones may present with episodes of severe upper-abdominal pain several years after cholecystectomy. The pain is often incapacitating, and patients are often addicted to narcotic analgesics. The work-up includes abdominal ultrasonography and CT scanning and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography even though the findings usually are normal. Liver and pancreatic enzymes are not frequently elevated with the painful episodes. Transendoscopic manometry may reveal elevated pressures within the papillary portion of the distal bile duct. Some patients are relieved of their pain by transduodenal sphincteroplasty and transampullary septectomy, thereby ablating the sphincter of Oddi around the bile and pancreatic ducts and enlarging their openings.\r"

Most strictures occur as a result of injury to the bile duct during cholecystectomy. In addition, strictures can occur at the site of previous biliary anastomoses for reconstruction of the biliary tree. Most patients with benign bile duct strictures present soon after their initial operation; however, in some cases, presentation is delayed for years. Cholangiography is essential for defining the anatomy of the biliary tree prior to management. In many cases, nonoperative biliary drainage is useful to treat sepsis and biliary fistulas. A number of alternatives exist for elective repair of bile duct strictures. Experience would suggest, however, that a choledochojejunostomy or hepaticojejunostomy performed through a Roux-en-Y limb of jejunum is the preferable management in most cases. Postoperative biliary stenting may be valuable in optimizing the results. Nonoperative management by percutaneous transhepatic or endoscopic balloon dilatation has been reported to be successful in a number of small series. Long-term results are limited, however. Comparative data suggest that surgical repair for benign postoperative strictures is associated with fewer long-term problems and with similar overall morbidity and costs.\r"

  ".W": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare disease of unknown etiology. Sclerosis of the bile ducts may actually be the final result of multiple factors such as autoimmune, bacterial, congenital, drug, or viral injury. The most commonly associated diseases are ulcerative colitis and chronic pancreatitis. Except in the earliest stages of the disease, liver histologic findings are not specific. Most patients present with jaundice, pain, and pruritus, although an increasing number of asymptomatic patients with inflammatory bowel disease and abnormal liver function are being identified. Cholangiography is key to the diagnosis and is usually pathognomonic except in the unusual case where primary sclerosing cholangitis is confused with cholangiocarcinoma. Many forms of medical therapy have been tried, including antibiotics, azathioprine, cholestyramine, colchicine, cyclosporine, D-penicillamine, steroids, and ursodeoxycholic acid. To date, none of these medications has been proved to alter the course of this disease. Recent reports of ursodeoxycholic acid trials have been encouraging, but long-term results of ongoing randomized trials have yet to be published. In recent years, balloon dilatation of biliary strictures has been accomplished via endoscopic and percutaneous transhepatic approaches. However, in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, these nonoperative manipulations must be done repeatedly, may entail multiple general anesthetics, and are difficult to perform. We believe that a direct surgical approach to the biliary tree with long-term transhepatic stenting is indicated in selected patients with severe hilar or extrahepatic stricturing, persistent jaundice or recurrent cholangitis, and no evidence of cirrhosis. Hepatic transplantation should be reserved for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis who have well-established cirrhosis and have not responded to other therapeutic measures.\r"

This dictum is highlighted in infants with biliary atresia, in whom the progressive sclerosing process results in complete obliteration of patent but microscopic hilar biliary structures by 4 months of age. Kasai's operation, if done before that time, will re-establish bile drainage in 90% of infants. One fourth to one third of patients achieve long-term jaundice-free survival. Complications of cholangitis, portal hypertension, and fat malabsorption are experienced by many patients. In children with early or late operative failure, liver replacement now offers legitimate hope for extended survival. Choledochal cyst is a conglomerate of pancreaticobiliary anomalies consisting of a choledochal cyst, a common-channel-type pancreaticobiliary junction, intrahepatic cystic disease, and partial obstruction of the distal common bile duct. Many patients have one or more of these malformations. It is now widely accepted that the preferred treatment of choledochal cyst is total excision of the diseased biliary duct with reconstruction by Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy. \"Internal\" excision avoids injury to other structures in the hepatoduodenal ligament, particularly if pericystic inflammation is present. Congenital perforation of the common bile duct responds in most cases to simple peritoneal drainage of the perforation. Retention of the tube cholecystostomy is useful for subsequent cholangiographic follow-up. Tube cholecystostomy may also be useful for irrigation of the biliary tract in infants with inspissated bile syndrome.\r"

In the clinical setting of obstructive jaundice, a CT scan or sonogram may suggest cholangiocarcinoma if dilated intrahepatic ducts are seen with a nondilated extrahepatic biliary tree. The diagnosis is confirmed by cholangiography, and the tumor is staged by the combination of cholangiography and angiography. If the tumor extensively involves both lobes of the liver or involves the main portal vein or hepatic artery, the lesion is considered unresectable. These patients are best palliated nonoperatively, but they should still have an attempt at a tissue diagnosis, as various other lesions can masquerade as cholangiocarcinoma. In comparison, if the tumor is confined to or is distal to the hepatic duct bifurcation, extends into only one lobe of the liver, or involves only the right or the left portal vein or hepatic artery, the lesion may be resectable, and exploration is indicated. As many as half of all patients explored with curative intent will have a successful resection. Various surgical options are appropriate for patients undergoing tumor resection, depending on the site and extent of the lesion. Similarly, several surgical options are possible for palliation in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. The role of radiotherapy in the management of cholangiocarcinoma is uncertain. Our results, like those of many other retrospective analyses, suggest that radiotherapy prolongs survival after curative resection as well as after palliative stenting. However, further data from randomized studies are necessary to support or refute this impression. Further studies of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy will also be necessary to improve patient survival.\r"

Three separate cases of thyroid carcinoma after long-term lithium therapy were also treated, being preceded by myxedema (n = 2) and concurrent with hyperparathyroidism (n = 1). There has been only one previous report of lithium-associated thyroid carcinoma. All patients taking lithium should undergo surveillance for thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction and neoplasia, and appropriate surgical and medical treatment should be considered in each situation.

Of 865 patients successfully operated on by one surgeon (J.N.A.), multiple enlarged parathyroid glands (adenomas) were found and resected in 33 cases (3.8%), with resulting normocalcemia lasting from 1 to 22 years (mean 5.8). Twenty-nine patients had two adenomas and four had three adenomas. In 28 patients the multiple adenomas were synchronous. Twenty-five patients underwent removal of all of the enlarged parathyroid glands in one operation; in three patients one adenoma was removed, reoperation for persistent hypercalcemia was performed, and a second adenoma was resected with cure. In five patients one adenoma was removed, normocalcemia ensued for 3 to 18 years, and a second (metachronous) adenoma occurred and was resected successfully. Although 10 of 70 enlarged parathyroid glands removed were labeled hyperplasia, cure in all but one of our patients by selective resection of only enlarged parathyroid glands emphasizes the unreliability of histologic criteria in differentiating between parathyroid adenoma and hyperplasia. Based on this study, we support the existence of multiple adenomas and advocate removal of only macroscopically enlarged parathyroid glands in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.\r"

The system used was a 7.5 MHz transducer mounted on the tip of an endoscope with an external diameter of 13 mm. The field of visualization was 360 degrees. A retrograde exploration was done moving up from the aortic arch to the upper esophageal sphincter. All patients underwent surgery afterward, and adenomas were found. In 12 cases the adenoma was visualized. All 12 adenomas were posteriorly located on the right side (four cases) and left side (eight cases) of the esophagus. Nine of these 12 tumors were on the posterior face of the thyroid lobes, with six tumors in the middle one third of the thyroid lobe and three in the lower one third of the thyroid lobe. The other three tumors were located below the lower pole of the thyroid lobes in the upper posterior mediastinum. Mean tumor weight was 1165 mg. Of the 11 tumors that could not be visualized, eight tumors were anteriorly located; three of these tumors were on the anterior and lateral surface of the lower pole of the thyroid, and five were in the thyrothymic tracts. The remaining three tumors were located on the back of the thyroid lobes; two of these tumors were at the upper esophageal sphincter, and one was on the side of the pharynx. Mean tumor size was 1334 mg. Localization of parathyroid tumors by endosonography appears possible but only if lesions are located posteriorly, close to the esophagus. Endosonography is not indicated before routine cervical exploration for primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism. As in other such studies, endosonography could be useful in cases of persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "An oral calcium load test (CLT) (1 gm Ca/50 kg) was administered to 11 control subjects and 35 patients with overt hyperparathyroidism to assess its efficacy in diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. All participants were placed on a low-calcium diet 3 days before the CLT. Intact parathormone and ionized calcium (Cai) levels were measured 0, 1, 2, and 3 hours after CLT. Initial Cai and parathormone (mean +/- SE) were 1.22 +/- 0.01 mmol/L and 2.94 +/- 0.03 pmol/L in the control group compared with 1.43 +/- 0.02 mmol/L and 10.6 +/- 2.2 pmol/L in the group with hyperparathyroidism. Both groups had a similar percent increase in Cai values (control, 5.9% +/- 0.8%; hyperparathyroidism, 6.3% +/- 0.6% (p greater than 0.1). A decline in parathormone levels of 47.6% +/- 2.8% in patients with hyperparathyroidism was significantly less than the 75.3% +/- 5.3% decline observed in control subjects (p less than 0.025). Three hours after CLT, parathormone was suppressed in control subjects, whereas a rebound occurred in patients with hyperparathyroidism. Postoperative CLT demonstrated a higher mean percent Cai increase and percent parathormone decline (Cai, 8.9% +/- 1.1%; parathormone, 67.9% +/- 1.8%) compared with preoperative values (Cai, 6.0% +/- 1.0%; PTH, 49.6% +/- 4.3%) (p less than 0.025), and 3 hours after calcium intake, parathormone remained suppressed, similar to control subjects. After surgery, three patients had elevated parathormone and low normal Cai levels and parathormone response to a CLT confirmed the diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism. In conclusion, a CLT (1) can confirm the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism and successful parathyroidectomy, (2) distinguished postoperative secondary from persistent primary hyperparathyroidism, (3) demonstrated nonautonomy of abnormal parathyroid glands with a parathormone response to a calcium load characterized by an earlier nadir, decreased suppressibility, and more rapid recovery, and (4) produced dynamic changes that did not distinguish patients with hyperparathyroidism from control subjects or hyperplasia from adenoma.\r"

It also can permit investigators to conduct experiments without dependence on the operating room schedule. Availability of cryopreservation has been limited by the perceived need for expensive, complex equipment. We adapted a simple method of freezing cell suspensions to freezing human parathyroid tissue. Vials containing human parathyroid in culture media, dimethylsulfoxide, and patient serum were placed in a plastic rack in a metal pan containing prechilled (4 degrees C) ethanol and placed in a -70 degrees C freezer. We compared viability (trypan blue dye exclusion by collagenase dispersed cells) of tissue frozen in this manner to that of tissue frozen in a programmable liquid nitrogen freezer at 1 degrees C per minute, a cooling rate recommended for human parathyroid tissue. The viability of 30 patients' samples cooled in liquid nitrogen (average length of storage 5 months) was 74% +/- 15% and that of 64 patients' samples cooled in ethanol (average length of storage 26 months) was 71% +/- 15%. Viability of 19 samples of fresh tissue was 79% +/- 10%. Neither method had a statistically significant correlation between length of storage and viability. Successful cryopreservation with simplified technology may expand the availability of parathyroid tissue to meet both clinical and investigative requirements.\r"

  ".W": "Heterotransplantation of adenomatous parathyroid glandular tissue from humans with primary hyperparathyroidism into athymic nude mice creates a unique animal model of this disease. The mice manifest high concentrations of both midregion/C-terminal human parathyroid hormone and biologically active intact human parathyroid hormone relative to either mice with no implants or mice that received normal human parathyroid tissue. Secretion of these substances is maintained in most mice for at least 9 to 13 months after implantation. In addition, animals that have experienced implantation exhibit other characteristics associated with human primary hyperparathyroidism including relative hypercalcemia and increased renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 alpha-hydroxylase activity. We also measured these parameters in a group of nude mice that received transplantation of a similar mass of hyperplastic parathyroid tissue that was obtained from patients with uremic secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although we hypothesized that the level of human parathyroid hormone secretion from these implants would fall over time in response to the normal host environment, hormone levels remained as high as those in recipients of adenomatous heterografts, even after 9 to 13 months. Moreover, similar biologic effect of the excess parathyroid hormone (i.e., relative hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatasemia, and increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D biosynthesis) were detected. These animal models should prove extremely useful in supplementing our understanding of hyperparathyroid disorder in man.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have fueled an interest in the prevalence and significance of metastatic calcium deposition in patients with chronic hyperparathyroidism. Experimental data are limited by the lack of suitable in vivo animal models. We have developed a model of marked hypercalcemia and overproduction of parathyroid hormone using somatic gene transfer. Briefly, the process involves infection of cultured rodent fibroblasts (RAT-1 cells) with a retroviral expression vector that contains the gene encoding human parathyroid hormone. Fibroblasts are grown to confluence on collagen-coated dextran microcarrier beads and are injected into the peritoneal cavities of syngeneic Fisher rats. Human parathyroid hormone production in rat serum is quantified by an immunoradiometric assay for human parathyroid hormone (1-84), which does not recognize rat parathyroid hormone. These rats consistently show production of human hormone within a week. Levels increase progressively, often to 1 ng/ml within 60 days of injection. Serum calcium showed a concomitant rise to an average of 15.5 mg/dl. In this study, 13 rats that had been transplanted with parathyroid hormone-producing fibroblasts were killed 80 days after injection. Examination of the skeleton revealed demineralization and histopathologic sequelae of parathyroid hormone excess with extensive osteoclastic bone resorption. Examination of the hearts revealed calcification in five of 13 hearts. There was no involvement of major coronary arteries or conducting systems, but there was calcification of cardiac myocytes, primarily in subepicardial region. This model may permit an understanding of the mechanisms for sudden cardiac death in severe hypercalcemia.\r"

Calcific deposits in the myocardium were seen in 13 patients (62%) with PHP, mainly in the interventicular septum, and in one control subject. Aortic valve calcification was observed in 12 patients (57%) with PHP and in one control subject. Calcification of the mitral valve was found in seven patients with PHP (33%) and three controls (14%). Calcification led to mild or moderate stenosis of the aortic valve in three patients with PHP and of the mitral valve in two patients with PHP. No stenosis was found in the subjects in the control group. Both calcification of the aortic and mitral valves and calcific deposits in the myocardium are common in patients with PHP and can be detected noninvasively by echocardiography. Because of the potential relationship of elevated calcium, calcification, and valvular heart disease, clinical evaluation of PHP should include echocardiographic studies before surgery is performed and during follow-up examination.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with hyperparathyroidism appear to be a particular risk for peptic ulcer disease. To test the hypothesis that hypercalcemia or parathyroid hormone plays a role in promoting ulcer disease, we studied the effect of varying concentrations of extracellular calcium on acid secretion using in vitro isolated rabbit gastric glands. Acid secretion was assessed by the accumulation of carbon 14-labeled aminopyrine (14C-AP). Glands were incubated with varying calcium concentrations in the unstimulated state and with histamine or carbachol (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/L) in 1 or 2 mmol/L calcium medium. The effect of parathyroid hormone was also examined under identical conditions. Compared to 1 mmol/L standard calcium medium, unstimulated 14C-AP accumulation was significantly inhibited (p less than 0.05) at both lower (0.33 mmol/L) and higher (2 and 2.5 mmol/L) calcium concentrations. Accumulation of 14C-AP in response to histamine stimulation was unaffected by alteration of extracellular calcium (p greater than 0.2). Carbachol-stimulated 14C-AP accumulation was significantly augmented (p less than 0.01) by an increase in calcium concentration from 1 to 2 mmol/L. The addition of parathyroid hormone (10(-7) to 10(-4) mmol/L) alone or in combination with carbachol or histamine (10(-6) mmol/L) incubation did not alter 14C-AP accumulation. These data suggest that elevations in extracellular calcium play an active role in the potentiation of cholinergic-mediated gastric gland acid secretion and may thereby play a role in hyperparathyroid-related ulcer disease.\r"

  ".W": "The knowledge that (1) the normal thyroid contains somatostatin, (2) polypeptide growth factors influence thyroid cell function, and (3) thyroid cells contain steroid hormone receptors prompted us to add somatostatin analogue No. 201-995 (SMS) (5 ng/ml) and/or tamoxifen citrate (TAM) (5 mumol/L) to 7-day monolayer cultures (50,000 cells/well) of three separate human thyroid carcinoma cell lines: DR081 (medullary), WR082 (follicular), and NPA'87 (papillary). Results, tabulated as cell numbers/well (X10(5) on day 7, revealed that TAM inhibited growth of medullary and follicular cells and that TAM plus SMS inhibited growth of papillary cells. In vivo studies of subcutaneous tumor cell xenografts in nude mice have documented that TAM (5 mg subcutaneous pellet) significantly inhibits the growth of medullary implants. Flow cytometric DNA studies of medullary cell cultures demonstrated a reduced G2 + M phase with TAM treatment. For papillary cell implants, TAM plus SMS (5 micrograms subcutaneously, twice daily) did not suppress tumor growth. All three cell lines were negative for estrogen receptor; addition of estradiol (5 ng/ml) to medullary cell cultures neither stimulated replication nor reversed the inhibitory effects of TAM in vitro. We conclude that (1) TAM slowed the growth of a cell line of human medullary carcinoma, both in vitro and in vivo; (2) this effect was not reversed by estradiol; (3) TAM plus SMS inhibited replication of a papillary carcinoma cell line in vitro, but not in vivo; and (4) TAM alone and TAM plus SMS inhibited replication of cultures of a human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line. TAM and SMS may be useful in treatment of some human thyroid carcinomas.\r"

Previously only five patients with this clinical problem who underwent unilateral adrenalectomy during pregnancy had been reported. We have reviewed the world literature on Cushing's syndrome in pregnancy secondary to an adrenal adenoma. A total of 19 patients who had unilateral adrenalectomy for this problem after the completion of pregnancy were identified. The review of world literature and the two patients who are the subject of this report were the basis of our analysis of fetal death, neonatal complications, and maternal complications in seven pregnancies during which unilateral adrenalectomy was performed (group 1) compared to the 19 pregnancies that were associated with unilateral adrenalectomy at the completion of pregnancy (group 2). Of the seven pregnancies in group 1, one fetal death and no neonatal complications occurred, but fetal death and neonatal complications occurred in 12 of the 19 pregnancies in group 2. Four of the seven mothers in group 1 had complications; 16 of the 19 mothers in group 2 had complications. This study suggests that adrenalectomy during pregnancy should be considered as a therapeutic option in the management of Cushing's syndrome secondary to an adrenal cortical adenoma.\r"

Twelve patients underwent bilateral adrenalectomies for Cushing's disease after failed transsphenoidal explorations and pituitary irradiation. Six patients had primary adrenal hyperplasia, five as manifestations of Carney's complex. Two others underwent bilateral adrenalectomies for ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone from carcinoid tumors. Four patients had adrenocortical carcinoma treated with transabdominal adrenalectomy. Three are alive from 8 years to 5 months. There was one postoperative death (2.3%) caused by coagulopathy and multiple organ failure and three (7%) minor postoperative complications. Follow-up showed good to excellent results in 95% of patients. It is concluded that adrenalectomy provides prompt relief from the severe morbidity of Cushing's syndrome regardless of the cause. It is the treatment of choice for adrenal adenomas, carcinomas, primary hyperplasia, and selected patients with Cushing's disease.\r"

  ".W": "The recovery time of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis after curative resection of adrenal tumors in patients with Cushing's syndrome is poorly documented. Eight consecutive patients were treated with a standardized hydrocortisone replacement strategy after curative resection of a cortisol-secreting tumor and the time to recovery of the HPA axis was determined. Hypercortisolism was documented by elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. Cure was documented by undetectable postoperative morning serum cortisol levels. Each patient received replacement hydrocortisone after surgery and was reevaluated every 3 to 6 months with an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Each patient was also monitored carefully for symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency, which was defined as symptoms consistent with this diagnosis that responded to increases in hydrocortisone levels. After surgical resection, each patient was cured of hypercortisolism. Subsequently, despite replacement hydrocortisone, each patient had symptoms of hypocortisolism, and in four of eight patients the dose of hydrocortisone was increased to relieve the symptoms. Patients required a median time of 15 months (range, 9 to 22 months) to recover a normal ACTH stimulation test and 19 months (range, 12 to 24 months) to allow discontinuation of replacement doses of hydrocortisone. The results suggest that surgical resection of a cortisol-secreting adrenal tumor will result in rapid cure of hypercortisolism, but complete recovery of the HPA axis and discontinuation of replacement steroids will require between 1 and 2 years. Normal adrenal function, as assessed by the cortisol response to ACTH, returns despite replacement doses of hydrocortisone, and replacement doses of hydrocortisone can be tapered rapidly or discontinued after a normal ACTH stimulation test.\r"

Seventeen resections were curative (no gross residual tumor); nine patients had symptomatic endocrinopathies and seven patients had symptoms caused by the primary tumor. Eight of nine patients with symptomatic endorcrinopathies obtained complete relief of symptoms; five are alive with no evidence of disease at 2 to 82 months (mean, 26 months). Six of seven patients with symptoms caused by the primary tumor obtained complete relief; five are alive with no evidence of disease at 5 to 28 months (mean, 14 months). One symptom-free patient underwent curative hepatic resection 5 years after abdominoperineal resection for a rectal carcinoid. Twenty resections were palliative (gross residual tumor); 16 patients had symptomatic endocrinopathies and 4 patients had symptoms caused by the primary tumor. Eight of 16 patients with symptomatic endocrinopathies obtained complete relief; five are alive at 2 to 30 months (mean, 11 months), with a mean duration of complete relief of 6 months (3 to 12 months). All four patients who underwent resection for symptoms caused by the primary tumor obtained complete relief; two are alive and symptom free at 10 and 101 months. Our experience suggests that curative surgery should be considered in all patients with completely resectable metastatic disease and that palliative surgery, despite the short duration of complete relief, should be considered in selected patients because it delays and may reduce the subsequent need for medical therapy.\r"

Plasma levels of CGRP have been elevated in animal models with sepsis. This study was designed to determine whether plasma CGRP levels are elevated in patients with sepsis and perhaps contribute to the hyperdynamic cardiovascular state in sepsis. Plasma CGRP levels were obtained from normal healthy volunteers and from patients with sepsis. Volunteers were afebrile and had normal pulse and blood pressure. Patients with sepsis were selected according to the following criteria: (1) temperature higher than 38.5 degrees C, (2) white blood count greater than 14,000/ml, (3) positive blood culture of bacterial organisms, (4) hemodynamic parameters consistent with hyperdynamic sepsis, and (5) negative history of thyroid or other endocrine abnormalities. CGRP was extracted and assayed by radioimmunoassay for iodine 125-labeled human CGRP. In patients with sepsis, the cardiac index was 5.4 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2 (normal, 3.0); systemic vascular resistance was 7.1 +/- 0.5 mm Hg/L/min (normal, 16); oxygen delivery was 1496 +/- 137 ml/min (normal, 1000).

These elevated levels of CGRP may contribute to the decreased vascular resistance and increased cardiac output in the hyperdynamic septic state.\r"

Altered cell morphology has been associated with changes in gene transcription and translation, but it is not known whether it also affects posttranslational processing. Using tyrosine-O-sulfation as a marker of processing, we studied the effects of various substrates on biologically active gastrin (IRG) production and sulfation in gastrin-containing tumor cells (GT cells). Dispersed GT cells were plated onto different substrates and then incubated. Culture media from days 4, 7, and 28 were assayed with specific antibodies that recognize total IRG and nonsulfated IRG. Cells cultured on plastic and dried films of laminin, collagen, and Matrigel (Collaborative Research Inc., Lexington, Mass.) flattened and formed monolayers of GT cells. Cells cultured on a porous membrane and hydrated gels of collagen and Matrigel did not flatten but formed spheroids of GT cells. The monolayer cultures showed an increase in sulfation with time but a decrease in IRG production. The spheroid cultures maintained a constant level of sulfation over time and, with the exception of Matrigel (gel), also showed a decrease in IRG production. These results indicate that the level of sulfation was unchanged from that of the original tumor when cells were grown in spheroids but increased when cultured as monolayers. It appears that alteration of the cellular milieu alters colony morphology, which in turn alters gastrin processing.\r"

After resection of all islet cell tumors, 4 of 12 patients evaluated after surgery still had elevated levels. Fifteen patients had islet cell tumors that were localized (seven insulinomas and eight gastrinomas), but none of these patients had elevated hPP levels, either before or after surgery. Nine patients, including one with FMEN-I, with metastatic islet cell tumors to the liver were studied; three with more advanced disease had elevated hPP levels before surgery. Each of the nine patients underwent resection of all gross disease and the three patients with elevated preoperative levels had normal postoperative hPP levels. Our results indicate that basal plasma levels of hPP were not clinically useful. The hPP levels did not reliably predict the presence of islet cell tumors in patients with FMEN-I, because 46% of patients with tumors did not have elevated plasma levels, and in those with elevated values hPP levels did not reliably predict the resection of all tumor. Plasma levels of hPP have no utility in patients with localized sporadically occurring islet cell tumors and limited utility (33%) in predicting the presence of metastatic islet cell tumors to the liver.\r"

  ".W": "Many advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with Cushing's disease. Currently, partial or total transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary gland is the surgical approach favored by many authorities, with cure rates of 80% to 90% reported for selected patients. However, long-term follow-up is still needed for this treatment modality, and recurrence rates of up to 50% have been reported. In addition, less favorable results are seen with this approach when there is recurrence after initial transsphenoidal surgery or when there is not a single microadenoma responsible for the disease of the pituitary gland. We report a series of 14 patients who were treated with bilateral adrenalectomy and autotransplantation. Follow-up is 4 to 14 years. Four patients show iodocholesterol uptake at the site of autotransplantation. Of these, three patients have been weaned from cortisone for 12, 10, and 2 years. The fourth patient, after being weaned from all medications, underwent partial resection of a hyperfunctioning autotransplant and currently, 7 years after the original operation, is being weaned from cortisone. A fifth patient was weaned to a reduced dose of cortisone for 8.5 years, but the dose was recently increased. There is no evidence of Nelson's syndrome in any of these patients with clinical evidence of functioning autotransplants. We believe that bilateral adrenalectomy with autotransplantation still plays an important role in the long-term management of selected cases of Cushing's disease and that autotransplantation, when successful, results in few complications and allows long-term freedom from exogenous steroid medication.\r"

We reviewed 22 patients with RP who were seen at our center between 1949 and 1990. The distribution of male and female patients was nearly equal, and the mean age was 42. Most patients were admitted with pain or a mass, and eight of 22 tumors were functional. No significant difference was noted in duration of symptoms, size of the tumor, or survival between functional and nonfunctional tumors. Eleven of 22 (50%) RP metastasized and were therefore classified as malignant. Five-year and 10-year disease free survival rates were 19% and 19% for tumors not resected and 75% and 45% for those completely resected. Once metastases occurred, the 5-year survival rate was 36%, but no patient survived beyond 76 months. Predictors of survival included complete resection of the tumor but not size or functional status. Although some patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy had clinical responses, a survival benefit could not be shown. RP have a high rate of malignant behavior and should be treated aggressively with operation. Late metastases are not uncommon, and prolonged follow-up is necessary. Once metastases have occurred, some patients may have prolonged survival.\r"

Synthetic somatostatin analogues have proved to be clinically effective in controlling this diarrhea. We have established a continuous cell line from a human pancreatic carcinoid tumor that secretes 5-HT. We examined the ability of the somatostatin analogue, SMS 201-995, to inhibit 5-HT release in vitro. Tumor cells were exposed to SMS 201-995 (10(-6) mol/L), pentagastrin (10(-9) mol/L), acetylcholine (10(-5) mol/L), and isoproterenol (10(-5) mol/L) alone and in combination; 5-HT release was assayed with high pressure liquid chromatography. We found that pentagastrin (6.43 +/- 0.64 ng/ml), isoproterenol (20.24 +/- 2.17 ng/ml), and acetylcholine (12.39 +/- 1.10 ng/ml) each stimulated release of 5-HT compared to control values (4.38 +/- 0.42 ng/ml). SMS 201-995 significantly reduced release of 5-HT in response to isoproterenol and acetylcholine but did not inhibit the effect of pentagastin. These data suggest that different agents do not act through the same pathway to stimulate 5-HT release from human pancreatic carcinoid cells.\r"

  ".W": "Somatostatin is widely distributed within the nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal actions of somatostatin include inhibition of hormone release, reduction of pancreatic secretion, inhibition of motility, and reduction of blood flow. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of somatostatin and its analogue octreotide on water and electrolyte transport in the small intestine. Rabbit ileal segments (n = 17) were harvested and arterially perfused ex vivo with a nonrecirculating oxygenated sanguineous solution. The lumen was perfused with an isotonic solution containing carbon 14-labeled polyethylene glycol. Net fluxes of water, Na+, and Cl- were calculated for three 20-minute periods designated basal, drug infusion, and recovery. Three groups were studied: somatostatin at 10(-6) mol/L (n = 5), somatostatin at 10(-5) mol/L (n = 5), and octreotide at 10(-5) mol/L (n = 7). Somatostatin at 10(-5) mol/L yielded a proabsorptive effect on the flux of water and electrolytes. Octreotide at 10(-5) mol/L caused a significant (p less than 0.05) proabsorptive response in the fluxes of water, sodium, and chloride during the period of drug infusion, which returned to basal secretory levels during the recovery period. This proabsorptive effect occurred without alterations in vascular resistance and necessarily was independent of systemic hormone interaction, supporting a direct effect of octreotide on intestinal ionic transport.\r"

All patients showed the typical clinical picture of the superior vena cava syndrome. A right parasternal thoracotomy was performed for preparation of the major vessels. The superior vena cava was opened and the entire intravascular tumor thrombus was removed. The cavotomy was closed directly in two patients. In the third patient the left brachiocephalic trunk was resected and reconstructed with a vascular (polytetrafluoroethylene) graft. This patient had bone and brain metastases and an occlusion of the graft 3 months after surgery after anticoagulation was stopped. The other two patients were clinically symptom free without local recurrence 13 and 50 months after surgery. An aggressive surgical approach is justified in grossly invasive thyroid cancer to decrease local recurrence and death rates, to correct the disturbing clinical symptoms of superior vena caval occlusion, and to prevent tumor embolism and the development of distant metastases. By reducing tumor mass, an even better basis for radioiodine treatment can be prepared.\r"

The opposite lobe was inspected at the time of operation and the surgeon made a determination as to whether there was bilateral and/or multicentric disease present. A total thyroidectomy was then carried out and the accuracy of the surgeon's judgment was established by permanent-section pathologic examination. Fifteen of the 44 patients were assessed to have gross bilateral disease. Thirteen of these were confirmed by pathologic examination. One case of microscopic bilateral disease was not recognized by the surgeon. Seventeen patients were thought to have unilateral multicentric disease. Fifteen of these cases were confirmed by microscopy and an additional seven cases were documented to have secondary foci. It is obvious from this study that most disease that is called microscopic disease is actually palpable. A review of the literature confirms this. It was very unlikely for a patient who did not have unilateral multicentric disease to have a contralateral focus of carcinoma. The incidence of bilateral disease was 32%, and the incidence of multicentric disease was 50%; the surgeon was very accurate in assessing this. We believe that surgeons who advocate lobectomy as the primary treatment for thyroid cancer are recognizing grossly detectable disease in a significant number of patients and thus are doing total thyroidectomies in most patients with bilateral disease.\r"

However, the surgeon is often not sure about the pathologic diagnosis of thyroid nodules. The accuracy of preoperative studies, such as ultrasonography and thyroid scanning, is limited. The most cost-effective test is fine-needle aspiration, the accuracy of which exceeds 80% in most series. However, a large group of nodules exist for which aspiration cytologic studies are considered to be either suspicious or indeterminate. The decision about the extent of thyroidectomy may be difficult in these patients. Intraoperative frozen section may help the surgeon to distinguish benign from malignant lesions, but as in fine-needle aspiration, the major problem is the distinction between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma. The frozen section diagnosis of follicular adenoma was changed to follicular carcinoma in one third of the cases (13 of 38 cases). The decision about the extent of thyroidectomy in patients with follicular adenomas was based on other prognostic factors, such as age and sex of the patient and the size of the nodule. The accuracy of frozen section diagnosis was 95%. Our experience suggests that decisions regarding the extent of thyroidectomy can best be made by preoperative fine-needle aspiration with confirmation by frozen section diagnosis in equivocal cases.\r"

  ".U": "91062856\r", 
  ".W": "To clarify the role of DNA measurements in predicting outcome after surgical treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), we performed flow cytometric analysis in nuclear suspensions of 119 MTC tumors. Of the 119 patients, 63 (53%) patients had sporadic tumors and 56 (47%) patients had familial tumors; survivors were followed for a mean of 13 years. DNA content was normal in 92 (77%) patients and abnormal (nondiploid) in 27 (23%) patients. Ten-year cause-specific mortality rates were 12%, 42%, and 49% with diploid, tetraploid/polyploid, or aneuploid tumors (p = 0.0009) and were greater with nondiploid tumors both in the sporadic (p = 0.012) and multiple endocrine neoplasia (familial) cases (p = 0.114). None of 27 patients with TNM stage I disease died of MTC. In patients with TNM stages II, III, and IV disease, DNA nondiploid tumors were associated with increased deaths from MTC. In a Cox proportional hazards model involving all 119 patients and adjusted for disease stage and inheritance pattern, nondiploid DNA was independently associated with increased deaths from MTC (p = 0.008). In an identical Cox model restricted to the 92 DNA diploid tumors, an S-phase fraction of 15.0% or more remained a significant variable (p = 0.034) after adjustment for stage and inheritance pattern. We therefore conclude that DNA measurements do have a role to play in predicting outcome after surgical treatment of MTC.\r"

A disordered actin architecture has been correlated with a high metastatic potential in melanoma, fibrosarcoma, and colon cancer models. Thyrotropin is known to induce growth and differentiation in cultured thyroid cells, whereas the carcinogenic phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) causes dedifferentiation and malignant transformation in many cell lines. We therefore assessed the effect of thyrotropin and TPA on the actin architecture of FTC-133 human follicular thyroid cancer cells in continuous culture. Staining of filamentous actin with rhodamine phalloidin showed that 1 mU/ml or 30 mU/ml thyrotropin-induced actin polymerization was detectable at 1 hour but more notable at 24 hours. Similarly TPA (0.008 to 10 mumol/L) caused rapid actin fiber disruption and redistribution to the cell periphery. Secondary antibody staining for alpha-actinin, a protein that binds and crosslinks actin, was more prominent after treatment with thyrotropin but decreased after TPA. These findings indicate that the actin cytoskeleton has a dynamic response to trophic factors. Thyrotropin promoted actin polymerization, but TPA caused depolymerization. These effects may correlate with cellular alpha-actinin levels. Actin architecture may therefore reflect the state of differentiation of thyroid tumor cells.\r"

In thyroid tumors the incidence of ras activation by specific point mutations has been reported to range from 33% in follicular adenomas up to 60% in anaplastic carcinomas. Because of our long-standing interest in Hurthle cell tumors, we began a study of 70 such cases to determine the incidence of ras mutations and their clinical correlates. Analysis of N-ras sequences at condon position 61, with the polymerase chain reaction method and oligonucleotide probe hybridization, showed point mutations of the normal codon CAA* in eight tumor samples. One was a mutation from CAA to AAA, one from CAA to CTA,* and six from CAA to CGA. These mutations would result in amino acid substitutions of lysine, leucine, or arginine for the normal glutamine at position 61 in the N-ras protein. Identical ras mutations in two tumors and some of their surrounding thyroid tissue may indicate that activating ras point mutations are an early event in carcinogenesis. The incidence of mutations was 1 of 24 (4%) of the histologically benign tumors, 5 of 34 (15%) of the intermediate tumors (with vascular or capsular permeation), and 2 of 12 (17%) in the malignant group. Four of these eight patients died of metastatic thyroid disease and four are alive without evidence of recurrence.\r"

The pharynx was studied by magnetic resonance imaging in all patients and in a group of eight healthy subjects (age 27 (6) years, body mass index 21.8 (2.2) kg/m2, both significantly lower than in the patients; p less than 0.05). On the midsagittal section and six transverse sections equally spaced between the nasopharynx and the hypopharynx several anatomical measurements were performed. Results showed that there was no difference between groups in most magnetic resonance imaging measurements, but that on transverse sections the pharyngeal cross section had an elliptic shape with the long axis oriented in the coronal plane in normal subjects, whereas in apnoeic and snoring patients the pharynx was circular or had an elliptic shape but with the long axis oriented in the sagittal plane. It is suggested that the change in pharyngeal cross sectional shape, secondary to a reduction in pharyngeal transverse diameter, may be related to the risk of developing sleep related disordered breathing.\r"

  ".W": "Output from jet nebulisers is calibrated traditionally by weighing them before and after nebulisation, but the assumption that the weight difference is a close measure of aerosol generation could be invalidated by the concomitant process of evaporation. A method has been developed for measuring aerosol output directly by using a solute (fluoride) tracer and aerosol impaction, and this has been compared with the traditional weight loss method for two Wright, six Turbo, and four Micro-Cirrus jet nebulisers and two Microinhaler ultrasonic nebulisers. The weight loss method overestimated true aerosol output for all jet nebulisers. The mean aerosol content, expressed as a percentage of the total weight loss, varied from as little as 15% for the Wright jet nebulisers to 54% (range 45-61%) for the Turbo and Micro-Cirrus jet nebulisers under the operating conditions used. In contrast, there was no discrepancy between weight loss and aerosol output for the ultrasonic nebulisers. These findings, along with evidence of both concentrating and cooling effects from jet nebulisation, confirm that total output from jet nebulisers contains two distinct fractions, vapour and aerosol. The vapour fraction, but not the aerosol fraction, was greatly influenced by reservoir temperature within the nebuliser; so the ratio of aerosol output to total weight loss varied considerably with temperature. It is concluded that weight loss is an inappropriate method of calibrating jet nebuliser aerosol output, and that this should be measured directly.\r"

  ".W": "A double blind, parallel group study was carried out to investigate the effect of inhaled budesonide in a moderate (200 micrograms) and a low (100 micrograms) twice daily dosage compared with the effect of placebo in 103 adults with mild symptomatic asthma. Subjects recorded peak expiratory flow (PEF), asthma symptoms, and beta 2 agonist consumption at home for a period of seven weeks (a one week run in and six weeks' treatment). Morning baseline PEF (around 80% of predicted normal) increased non-significantly to 88% with 200 micrograms budesonide daily and to 90% (p less than 0.05) with 400 micrograms, compared with 81% with placebo. Evening PEF (around 94% of predicted normal) did not change significantly with active or placebo treatment. By comparison with placebo, there was a significant decrease in nocturnal asthma symptoms and beta 2 agonist consumption. The changes during the day were less pronounced and significant only for 400 micrograms budesonide daily. No significant differences between the two active treatments were detected. It is concluded that low doses of inhaled budesonide are effective in patients with mild symptomatic asthma, particularly for night time symptoms and early morning lung function. The early introduction of inhaled corticosteroids for patients with mild asthma and night time symptoms may improve their quality of life during the night and early morning.\r"

  ".W": "When used in high doses, inhaled corticosteroids may cause suppression of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. The influence of the mode of drug inhalation on the degree of this suppression is not clear. Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function was assessed by measurement of 0900 h serum cortisol concentrations, a short tetracosactrin test, and 24 hour urine free cortisol excretion in 48 adults with asthma taking 1500-2500 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate daily via a metered dose aerosol. Twelve patients had hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression, as judged by subnormal results from at least two of the three tests or (in one patient) by an abnormal insulin stress test response. These patients then changed to inhaling the same dose of beclomethasone dipropionate through a 750 ml spacer device (Volumatic). The endocrine tests were repeated from nine days to eight weeks later in 10 patients. Comparison with initial values showed that adding the spacing device caused an increase in the median 0900 h cortisol concentration from 126 nmol/l to 398 nmol/l, in the post-tetracosactrin cortisol concentration from 402 nmol/l to 613 nmol/l and in 24 hour urine free cortisol excretion from 54 nmol to 84 nmol. The rise in serum cortisol concentration in response to tetracosactrin did not change. Evidence of persisting hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression was present in only four of the 10 patients; the most pronounced improvements in function tended to occur in those who had never required long term oral corticosteroids. The results from this uncontrolled study suggest that asthmatic patients taking high dose beclomethasone dipropionate may minimise adverse effects by using a large volume spacer device.\r"

  ".U": "91062878\r", 
  ".W": "Large spacing devices have been shown to provide more selective delivery of an inhaled steroid to the lung but the effect on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression associated with high dose inhaled corticosteroids has been little studied. The effect of a large spacing device (Volumatic; 750 ml) on suppression of 0900 h cortisol after 2 mg inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate was therefore investigated in normal, healthy volunteers. Twenty four subjects (12 male, 12 female) took part in a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled cross over study in which a single dose of 2 mg beclomethasone dipropionate was taken at 2300 h on two occasions seven days apart, once from a metered dose inhaler alone and once from a metered dose inhaler attached to a 750 ml spacing device. The 0900 h serum cortisol concentration was the same on the morning before each administration (468 nmol/l, 95% confidence interval (CI) 390-561 nmol/l, day 1 v 479 nmol/l, 95% CI 463-494 nmol/l, day 8). The 0900 h serum cortisol concentration the following morning, however, was lower when 2 mg beclomethasone dipropionate was given by metered dose inhaler alone (182 (95% CI 128-264) nmol/l) than when it was given by a spacing device (363 (95% CI 281-475) nmol/l). These results suggest that a large spacing device attached to a metered dose inhaler may decrease the risk of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal suppression by high dose inhaled steroid treatment.\r"

In the remaining 12 patients the catheter was connected to a one way flutter valve. The treatment was successful in 27 of the 28 patients--one patient required a large calibre chest tube. The mean drainage time was 48 hours. The small catheter technique is superior to the use of a large intercostal drain as it is much less traumatic and troublesome. The small calibre chest tube with a one way valve is recommended as a safe and easy technique.\r"

The area of prostatic induration suitable for RP was subsequently extended to less than one lobe (Stage B1); this extension of induration was supported by the study of Walsh and Jewett in 1980 showing a 51 percent survival free-of-disease at fifteen-year follow-up. Subsequently, clinical staging systems evolved which substaged clinical B into three categories of induration: B1N = less than 1.5 cm nodule, B1 = greater than 1.5 cm but less than one lobe, and B2 = one lobe or both lobes. To determine if digital assessment of these progressively greater degrees of induration would translate into different intervals to first progression, whether local or distant, we reviewed prostate diagrams and descriptions of all Stage B patients treated by Iodine-125 interstitial implant and external beam radiation therapy between 1974 and 1985 at our institution. Forty-six patients had B1 nodules, 78 patients B1 (less than one lobe), and 52 patients B2 (one lobe or greater). Mean follow-up was fifty-five months. We found B1N, which was also associated with well-differentiated grade and a normal acid phosphatase, to have the longest interval to progression.\r"

Moreover, the survival curves closely followed reference curves based on expected U.S. mortality for men of comparable ages and races. A statistically significant association between a high Gleason histologic score and poor survival was established.

Prior to RTBD of prostate, patients underwent cystoscopy, voiding cystourethrogram, urodynamic and uroflow studies. RTBD of prostate was done as an outpatient procedure requiring intravenous sedation or general anesthesia. Dilation was performed with a 25-mm urethroplasty balloon catheter inflated at 3.5 atm of pressure for twenty minutes. Improvement in voiding symptomatology was noted in all patients and graded numerically (0-10 scale), with ten indicating normal voiding. Follow-up to date ranges from one to five months. This technique may have promise as a treatment option in patients with abacterial chronic prostatitis and prostatodynia.\r"

The objective of this study was to determine radiographically the functional level of continence following radical prostatectomy relative to the site of the intraoperative urethral anastomosis. In 8 patients having a radical prostatectomy, an intraoperative hemoclip was placed at the site of the urethral anastomosis and the postoperative functional level of continence was determined using a standing lateral cystogram. The functional level of continence was 9 mm (SD = 3.0) distal to the site of the urethral anastomosis. The level in the urethra that continence occurs may be a function of the intrinsic continence parameters of each individual patient.\r"

These unusual structures were found in association with bilateral cryptorchidism and a right inguinal hernia, and were diagnosed while repairing the hernia in the neonatal period. The uterus and fallopian tubes were removed via laparotomy when the child was eighteen months old; at the same time a bilateral orchiopexy was performed. To avoid damage to the vas deferens, which lay in closely to the mullerian structures and could not be separated from the vaginal wall, a small segment of the upper third of the vagina was retained. The testicles, although normal on pathologic examination, have shown poor response to hormonal stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin. Long-term follow-up for these patients is necessary because they have an increased risk of testicular tumors developing.\r"

Eighteen patients have been treated with ketoconazole. The indications for usage have included: prompt therapeutic response, when orchiectomy is contraindicated, when estrogens are contraindicated, initial empirical therapy, and hormonally refractory disease. It can also be used in conjunction with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues. Ketoconazole is excellent for short-term usage prior to bilateral orchiectomy and when prompt therapeutic response is needed but orchiectomy cannot be performed. However, it is not particularly useful for long-term hormonal therapy.\r"

Testicular calcifications are most commonly associated with benign conditions. We review the literature regarding their relationship to neoplasms and the significance of the ultrasonic findings. Furthermore, this is the sixth reported case of testicular tumor developing during hormonal treatment for oligospermia. Although these cases may be circumstantial, closer surveillance and screening ultrasound may be indicated for subfertile males taking clomiphene citrate.\r"

Personal interviews were conducted with 990 noninstitutionalized elderly persons in Youngstown, Ohio. Results showed that poverty, gender, and race were not strongly related to health status as measured by numbers of symptoms, functional status, or subjective health status. In addition, elderly persons had fewer health care needs and greater access to care than expected. Simple models of health status, need, and access do not seem to apply.

This 16-item survey also requested typical laboratory reporting procedures on Papanicolaous smears. The most frequently reported cell sampling technique was the combination cotton-tipped applicator and spatula, which was used by 47 percent of all physicians. Use of the cervical cytobrush for Papanicolaou smears, which has been shown to improve the detection of cervical dysplasia, was used alone or in combination by 19 percent of those surveyed, of whom 72 percent were gynecologists. Cervical sampling should contain cells from the transformation zone as evidenced by an adequate number of endocervical cells on the smear. Laboratories reporting the presence of endocervical cells were significantly different (P less than 0.05) among the specialties, with 26 percent of the internists', 18 percent of the family physicians', and 15 percent of the obstetricians' laboratories not providing this information in their reports. Reporting inadequate smears is a necessary first step toward improved sampling technique. Without this information, physicians risk missing pathology through reports of false-negative Papanicolaou smears.\r"

The goals were to determine whether family history of heart disease or high cholesterol can predict which children have high cholesterol levels and to examine the feasibility of screening large numbers of elementary school students. Among the children studied, the mean cholesterol level was 168.3 mg/dL (4.35 mmol/L), and 13 percent had cholesterol levels above 200 mg/dL (5.20 mmol/L). Fifty-four percent had a family member with high cholesterol or a heart attack before age 60 years, but 36 percent of the students with cholesterol levels greater than 200 mg/dL (5.20 mmol/L) had a negative family history. Family history was neither sensitive nor specific as a predictor of elevated cholesterol levels (sensitivity 0.64, specificity 0.47, and positive predictive value 0.16 for predicting cholesterol levels greater than 200 mg/dL [5.20 mmol/L]). Large numbers of children were screened safely and efficiently with good student and parental cooperation. Results of this study do not support the current recommendations to screen children for hypercholesterolemia based upon their family histories.\r"

Because of the high prevalence of CHD in a growing elderly population, physicians must decide whether to devote clinical attention to this condition in older patients. Longitudinal cohort studies show that while the association between serum cholesterol and CHD decreases after age 55 years, it still persists. Primary prevention trials performed mostly on middle-aged men have reduced the incidence rate of CHD through cholesterol lowering but they have yet to show a reduction in overall mortality. Secondary prevention studies of lipid alteration have reported decreased mortality and slowed progression of coronary stenoses, again in predominantly male subjects aged less than 60 years. Implications of these findings for care of older patients are discussed along with recommendations for clinical management and future research.\r"

Aggressive surgical management is the treatment of choice in clinical stage I disease. Subsequent surveillance for recurrence is mandatory.

  ".W": "The clinical diagnostic accuracy of 2-day stress/rest quantitative Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (Tc-sestamibi) single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) was assessed in a validation population of 61 patients from two different sites using two different camera/computer systems. The study population was made up of 53 catheterized patients, 29 from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) and 24 from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSMC), and eight UTSMC patients with a less than 5% pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease. Interpretation employed gender-specific normal limits developed in an additional 15 men and 8 women at CSMC with less than a 5% likelihood of significant coronary artery disease. The results from CSMC compared with those from UTSMC were not different from each other. The overall sensitivity for detection of patients with coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis) was 94% (CSMC: 92%, UTSMC: 95%). Overall specificity in the five patients with normal coronary arteriograms was 80% (CSMC: 67%, UTSMC: 100%). The normalcy rate in patients with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease was 88%. Vessel sensitivity was 85% (CSMC: 84%, UTSMC: 85%), while vessel specificity was 71% (CSMC: 72%, UTSMC: 69%). There was also no significant difference in the sensitivities and specificities between male and female populations. In addition, the agreement with coronary angiography for assessment of disease extent (normal coronary arteriogram, single or multivessel disease) was 75% (kappa = 0.6 +/- 0.1). This study demonstrated that Tc-sestamibi SPECT by quantitative analysis is accurate for the detection and localization of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the CSMC quantitative method was shown to provide similar diagnostic accuracy when applied to data acquired at a different site using a different camera/computer system.\r"

Five patients had unstable angina, 25 had acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and 12 were resuscitated victims of sudden ischemic death. Twenty-two events occurred during sport (group A) and 20 after sport (group B). There were two women and 40 men. The mean age was 46 years (range 25 to 65). Twelve out of 30 patients who smoked cigarettes had an adjunctive risk factor for coronary artery disease. Twelve others (28%) had no identifiable risk factor. Prodromal cardiac symptoms were detected in three patients (group A). Two patients had previous myocardial infarction (group B). Coronary angiography was performed acutely in 39 patients. The distribution of the ischemia-related coronary artery was comparable in both groups. The lesion morphology of 35 culprit coronary arteries was described as concentric in six patients and eccentric with regular borders (type I lesion) in 11 and irregular borders (type II lesion) in 18. Eccentric lesions consistent with ruptured plaques prevailed in both groups. Associated coronary artery disease was present in 10 patients. There was no relationship between the number of risk factors and the extent of diseased coronary arteries. Clinical characteristics and coronary angiographic findings of patients with unstable angina, AMI, and sudden death either during or after sport are similar and indicate a common pathogenesis. The probable mechanism of a coronary event related to sport is exercise-induced plaque rupture. In most instances such an event is unexpected and unpredictable. Identification of some subjects at risk is possible.\r"

Tissue samples from both the anterior and posterior walls of the left ventricle were obtained for determination of catecholamine content, and the rest of the ventricles were processed for histologic examination. When subjected to treadmill exercise for 40 days after surgery, obstructed animals performed significantly less exercise than sham-operated animals and showed significantly higher percentages of ischemia and necrosis in the left ventricle than sedentary, obstructed, sham-operated, or control dogs. Levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the posterior wall of the left ventricle were significantly lower than in the other groups. Our data show that exercise in this well-known model of chronic coronary artery stenosis produced deleterious effects on the myocardium and suggest a marked heterogeneity of catecholamine stores in the myocardium that may have important functional and electrophysiologic consequences.\r"

Left anterior descending and circumflex coronary vasa vasorum flows were measured with radioactive microspheres at baseline, during, and 10 minutes after a 3-minute, 8 atm balloon inflation. With inflation, vasa vasorum flow at the balloon dilatation site profoundly decreased (from 0.25 +/- 0.08 to 0.03 +/- 0.01 ml/min/gm). The flow returned to normal within 10 minutes after deflation. This effect was not mediated by hemodynamic deterioration during coronary occlusion and did not occur in the contralateral coronary artery. Endomyocardial flow in the distribution of the dilated artery decreased markedly during balloon inflation (from 1.14 +/- 1.9 to 0.08 +/- 0.04 ml/min/gm), which confirmed coronary occlusion. We conclude that a prolonged decrease in vasa vasorum flow is not produced by experimental balloon angioplasty, which makes it unlikely that a sustained vasa vasorum flow reduction plays a role in the maintenance of patency or the induction of restenosis.\r"

To take advantage of the relative strengths of each method, we combined two of these methods into a single method (DUAL BAYES) and compared it with the two original methods in 436 patients who underwent stress testing followed within 2 months by coronary arteriography. All patients had post-test probabilities determined using CADENZA (better sensitivity). Those CADENZA-derived probabilities greater than or equal to 50% were substituted with post-test probabilities determined by Diamond and Forrester's original TABULAR method (better specificity). Mean post-test probabilities were as follows: TABULAR 34, CADENZA 48, DUAL BAYES 37 (actual incidence 38%). Comparison of sensitivity and specificity at every fifth percentile of post-test probability revealed that the sensitivity of DUAL BAYES was better than that of TABULAR and equal to that of CADENZA at thresholds less than or equal to 10 and that the specificity was better than that of CADENZA and equal to that of TABULAR at thresholds greater than or equal to 60. Therefore using both methods as indicated above was better than using either method alone.\r"

During a 45-month period that ended in June 1989, nine infants and children, ages 6 months to 7 years, underwent balloon angioplasty of recoarctation with resultant reduction in peak-to-peak systolic pressure gradient from 52 +/- 20 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) to 16 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and increase in coarctation segment size from 3.4 +/- 1.4 mm to 6.1 +/- 1.6 mm (p less than 0.01). None required surgical intervention. There were no significant complications. Follow-up catheterization (16 +/- 7 months) data in six children and follow-up clinical (17 +/- 6 months) data in all children were available for review. Both the residual coarctation pressure gradient (6 +/- 6 mm Hg) and coarctation segment size (8.2 +/- 2.4 mm) remain improved (p less than 0.001) when compared with pre-balloon angioplasty values and the pressure gradient fell further (p less than 0.01) when compared with that measured immediately after balloon angioplasty. None developed restenosis, although one child required surgical relief of severe narrowing of isthmus of the aortic arch. None developed aneurysms. On the basis of this experience and that reported in the literature and because of high morbidity and mortality rates associated with repeat surgery for postoperative recoarctation, we recommend balloon angioplasty as the procedure of choice for relief of postoperative recoarctation with significant hypertension.\r"

We have evaluated the use of a device capable of debriding calcium, the Cavitron ultrasonic aspirator (CUSA), as an adjunct to mechanical debridement in the repair of calcific aortic stenosis. Ten patients (five women), ages 63 to 83 years, were studied by M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiography before and an average of 26 (range 3 to 124) days after this procedure. The degree of calcification of the valve cusps was clearly reduced. The maximal cusp excursion increased from 0.7 +/- 0.1 cm preoperatively to 1.5 +/- 0.4 cm postoperatively (p = 0.006). The peak aortic gradient fell from 80 +/- 36 mm Hg to 28 +/- 10 mm Hg (p = 0.0007). The mean aortic gradient fell from 53 +/- 20 mm Hg to 16 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). Aortic valve area calculated by the continuity equation increased from 0.6 + 0.2 cm2 to 1.6 +/- 0.6 cm2 (p = 0.0009). No patient had more than mild aortic insufficiency preoperatively. Postoperatively, color Doppler flow mapping revealed severe aortic insufficiency in two patients. Seven patients had further echocardiographic evaluation 99 (range 33 to 196) days after the procedure. These studies revealed the development of severe aortic insufficiency in an additional four patients. Four patients with severe symptomatic aortic insufficiency eventually underwent aortic valve replacement. Pathology revealed scarring and retraction of the aortic cusps. Widening of the commissures was responsible for the severe aortic insufficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The use of beta-blockade was evaluated prospectively in 14 consecutive patients who required isoproterenol 2.4 +/- 1.3 (+/- S.D.) micrograms/min to induce sustained monomorphic VT (greater than 30 seconds, or requiring termination due to hemodynamic collapse) after a negative baseline study. The VT mechanisms were enhanced automaticity (group A, six patients), triggered automaticity (group B, three patients), and reentry (group C, five patients). Groups A and B had serial intravenous electropharmacologic tests with propranolol alone (0.2 mg/kg), verapamil alone (0.15 mg/kg), and propranolol plus verapamil, and group C had serial tests with propranolol alone, procainamide or quinidine (class Ia drug) alone, and propranolol plus a class Ia drug until VT could no longer be induced. All six patients in group A responded to propranolol alone. In group B, one patient responded to verapamil alone, and two patients responded to propranolol plus verapamil. In group C, three patients responded to propranolol alone, one patient responded to a class Ia drug alone, and one patient responded to propranolol plus a class Ia drug. During a follow-up of 7 to 37 (17.9 +/- 10.7) (+/- S.D.) months, VT has not recurred in any patient. Three patients treated initially with propranolol alone have required substitution of amiodarone due to refractory congestive heart failure. In patients requiring isoproterenol for VT induction, beta-blockade alone appears to be effective in preventing reinduction of VT caused by enhanced automaticity. A heterogeneous response occurs when the VT mechanisms are triggered automaticity or reentry.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 251 patients less than or equal to 65 years of age admitted for treatment of symptomatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmia to assess whether these arrhythmias begin evenly throughout the day or manifest circadian variation in occurrence. The arrhythmias included 152 episodes of atrial fibrillation, 50 episodes of supraventricular reentry tachycardia, 30 episodes of atrial flutter, and 19 cases of ectopic atrial tachycardia. A total of 209 patients could tell the exact time their symptoms had started. In 38 of them (18%), the arrhythmia had begun between midnight and 6:00 AM, in 63 (30%) between 6:01 AM and noon, in 46 (22%) between noon and 6:00 PM, and in 62 (30%) between 6:01 PM and midnight. This distribution differed significantly from uniform occurrence (chi square 8.7, p less than 0.05). Fifty patients were using beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents when the arrhythmia occurred. Compared with the other 159 patients, they had no morning surge of arrhythmias (20% versus 33.3% of episodes between 6:01 AM and noon), but instead a much higher incidence at night (34% versus 13.2% of episodes between midnight and 6:00 AM) (chi square 14.4, p less than 0.005). We conclude that the frequency of onset of sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmias varies with the time of day, showing nearly equal peaks in the morning and in the evening and a trough at night. The modifying effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockage suggests that many morning arrhythmias are of adrenergic origin while other, probably vagal arrhythmogenic mechanisms, prevail at night.\r"

  ".W": "We present the combined experience of three Yugoslavian cardiovascular centers in the application of endomyocardial biopsy for the diagnosis of myocarditis in patients who present clinically with congestive heart failure. The study group comprised 107 patients (mean age, 40.8 years; range, 19 to 61 years). On the basis of patient history and diagnostic tests, the following clinical diagnoses were established: dilated cardiomyopathy (85), myocarditis (16), and alcohol-induced heart disease (6). EMB samples were taken from the left ventricle (95) or both ventricles (12) by use of a King's College bioptome, with a mean of 3.2 samples per patient. Histologic evidence of myocarditis was noted in 10 of 85 patients (12%) with a clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, in 2 of 6 patients (33%) with alcohol-induced heart disease, and in 12 of 16 patients (75%) with a clinical diagnosis of myocarditis. There was confirmation of the clinically suspected diagnosis in 63% of cases, a change of diagnosis based on histology in 15% of cases, and nonspecific findings in 22%. However, useful information was obtained in 78% of the cases, and there was a 22% incidence of histologically proven myocarditis for the entire group. Our results indicate that endomyocardial biopsy is beneficial in determining the true incidence of myocarditis in patients with a clinical presentation of dilated cardiomyopathy.\r"

  ".U": "91063335\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of captopril on coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis was investigated. Thirty-two, 3-week-old mice were infected with coxsackievirus B3 on day 0 of the study, then randomized into a placebo group or a captopril group starting on day 3 of infection. On day 9 of infection, the mice were put to death. Hearts were weighed and processed for light microscopic examination. Heart weight was 125 +/- 19 mg in the control group versus 102 +/- 14 mg in the captopril group (p less than 0.0003). Amount of necrosis as a percentage of left ventricular section was 3.5% (2.0% to 7.5%) in the placebo group versus 2.0% (0.0% to 5.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01). The amount of dystrophic calcification was 5.0% (0.0% to 27.5%) in the placebo group versus 1.3% (0.0% to 20.0%) in the captopril group (p less than 0.01). The extent of the histopathologic involvement by planimetry was 10.2% in the placebo group versus 5.4% in the captopril group (p = 0.052). We conclude that captopril is beneficial in decreasing left ventricular mass and the amount of myocardial necrosis and calcification in the short term in the murine myocarditis model.\r"

  ".U": "91063336\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of xamoterol in the human myocardium. In the presence of forskolin or milrinone, xamoterol increased isometric force of contraction, contraction velocity, and relaxation velocity in isolated, electrically driven preparations from human myocardium, but had no effect alone. There was no difference in the effect of xamoterol between right atrial myocardium and left ventricular myocardium from nonfailing (NF), moderately failing (NYHA II-III), and severely failing (NYHA IV) human hearts. The positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of isoprenaline were reduced depending on the severity of heart failure in left ventricular myocardium (i.e., NF greater than NYHA II-III greater than NYHA IV). In the presence of norepinephrine, xamoterol produced negative inotropic effects similar to those of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists pindolol and propranolol. Xamoterol alone had no effects on force of contraction, whereas pindolol and propranolol markedly reduced contractile force. In NYHA class IV, isoprenaline stimulated adenylate cyclase about twofold but xamoterol, like pindolol or propranolol, had no effect. Experiments with the beta 1- and beta 2-selective antagonists CGP 207.12A and ICI 118.551, respectively, showed that the positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of xamoterol were mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors. Consistently, xamoterol had a selectivity of 13.8 at beta 1-adrenoceptors as measured in radioligand binding experiments. It is concluded that xamoterol acts as a beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a selectivity of 13.8 in human ventricular myocardium. The compound has an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, as it produces beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in the presence of forskolin. The beneficial effects of xamoterol in patients with heart failure could be due to prevention of the detrimental effects of norepinephrine such as beta 1-adrenoceptor downregulation of an increase of Gi (inhibitory guanine-nucleotide binding protein).\r"
