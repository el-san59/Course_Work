Compared with concentrations in DAT and controls, the concentrations of homovanillic acid (HVA) and biopterin were significantly decreased in DAT with extrapyramidal signs (EDAT). CSF 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenethyleneglycol and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid did not differ significantly among these groups. Age at onset of dementia was positively correlated with CSF HVA (r = 0.49, p less than 0.05). The two dementia groups did not differ significantly in the extent of ventricular dilation as measured by quantitative CT, but EDAT patients had lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores than did DAT patients. When patients were matched for age and dementia severity, CSF HVA and biopterin concentrations remained significantly lower in EDAT than in DAT patients. These results indicate that EDAT patients form a distinct subgroup of DAT with evidence of central monoamine dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the cassette-recorded 24-hour ambulatory EEG findings in children who had either clinically definite seizures or episodic behavioral disturbances not regarded as epileptic on clinical grounds. Among 40 epileptic patients, 22 had one or more attacks during the 24-hour recording session. In 15 of these patients all clinical attacks had appropriate ictal electrographic accompaniments; in another 6 some (but not all) attacks did so. Among 55 children with nonepileptic spells clinically, the 24-hour recording was uninterpretable for technical reasons in one, and in 30 it provided no relevant information because there were no recorded clinical or electrographic attacks. In the remaining 24 patients, one or more clinical attacks were captured, and in no instance was there any accompanying electrographic change. Our findings indicate that the absence of ictal EEG changes during attacks cannot be used in isolation to make a diagnosis of pseudoseizures, but support such a diagnosis made on clinical grounds. The more important role of the ambulatory EEG is to exclude a diagnosis of nonepileptic attacks by demonstrating electrographic seizure activity accompanying typical clinical attacks. Whether the technique will have a useful role in the evaluation of patients when the nature of an episodic disturbance of cerebral function is unclear clinically remains to be established, but will require long-term follow-up to validate any conclusions reached by the electrophysiologic technique.\r"

  ".W": "Although leptomeningeal spread (LMS) of primary CNS tumors in children has been well documented in the literature, it has rarely been reported in children with low-grade gliomas. Between 1975 and 1985, 6 of 162 children (3.7%) with low-grade gliomas treated at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia had LMS. LMS was present at diagnosis of the original tumor in one patient, was the first sign of relapse in one patient, occurred simultaneously with local relapse in two patients, and after local relapse in two patients. Pathology of the original tumor was low-grade astrocytoma in five and low-grade oligodendroglioma in one. Primary tumor site was cervical cord in three, chiasm in one, frontal lobe in one, and cerebellum in one. All of the children with LMS had undergone surgical treatment at the time of diagnosis of the primary tumor; four had total resections at some point in their course. Three of the six patients died; three are still alive after treatment with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. The longest survival to date has been 3 1/2 years after diagnosis of LMS. We compared clinical characteristics of these six patients with 131 children with low-grade tumors without dissemination treated at our institution during the same time period. LMS, although relatively infrequent, does occur in children with low-grade gliomas, especially spinal cord tumors. LMS may occur at any time during illness and diagnosis may be difficult unless LMS is suspected. Treatment, at times, results in clinical improvement and considerable disease control.\r"

Seven years after beginning work with EtO, she experienced impaired memory, increased irritability, clumsiness, and falling.

CSF studies revealed severe reduction of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Treatment with 5-hydroxytryptophan and carbidopa at highest tolerated dose mildly improved ataxia but did not modify the myoclonus. Treatment with anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, phenytoin, valproate, carbamazepine, and baclofen was unsuccessful. The clinical symptoms were progressive, leading to death or severe disability 5 to 10 years after the onset of the disease.\r"

Examination of affected members revealed mild to moderate proximal weakness and wasting. Contractures were observed at the elbows and ankles in all, while in some they were more widespread. Serum CK was either normal or slightly raised, and electrodiagnostic studies suggested a primary myopathy. Muscle biopsy revealed nonspecific features of a myopathy without fiber necrosis or regeneration. Cardiac involvement was absent clinically in all patients and at autopsy in two affected individuals. The similarities between four previously reported families and our own establishes this myopathy as a distinct clinicogenetic entity, for which we propose the name \"Bethlem myopathy.\"\r"

We found a higher incidence of rare hypervariable Ha-ras alleles (9.5% to 3%) and a 5 kilobase EcoRI c-mos allele (2.5% to 0%) in the patients.

Since in large myelinated axons caliber is a function of the number of NF, which, in turn, is regulated by axonal transport, we studied the correlation of the number of NF and microtubules (MT) with axonal cross-sectional area in the sciatic system of SZ-treated rats to investigate whether the changes in caliber could be attributed to the impairment of transport. Despite the changes in cross-sectional area, diabetic axons in both proximal motor roots and distal tibial nerves maintained the ratios of number of NF and MT to cross-sectional area found in controls. Our findings suggest that, in rats with SZ-induced diabetes, the proximal and distal alterations of axonal caliber are an adjustment to the change in number of NF and/or MT that results from the impairment of the slow axonal transport.\r"

The comparable figures for Igbo-Ora were as follows: population over age 39 = 3,412; cases of PD = 2; age-adjusted prevalence ratio = 67/100,000.\r"

We evaluated 120 patients with known last menstrual periods and normal pregnancies to develop a cross-sectional study population. All patients had ultrasonic measurement of the fetal foot length, biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length. Least-squares estimation of linear models was used to select the best mathematical models to describe the relationship between menstrual age and fetal foot length. A similar evaluation of the relationship between fetal foot length and the other measured parameters was performed. All models were best described by a linear equation. An R2 value of 0.94, with a standard error of the estimate of 0.204, was obtained for menstrual age versus fetal foot length. When the model for fetal foot length and menstrual age was compared with published anatomical data, close agreement was seen over the time interval studied. Our results suggest that the measurement of fetal foot length with ultrasound gives a reliable assessment of anatomical fetal or neonatal foot length and is highly correlated to the menstrual age of the fetus.\r"

Subsequent fetal heart rate (FHR) accelerations occurred to a significantly greater extent in study patients. One hundred thirty-two high- and low-risk patients were studied to determine correlations between the acceleration response and other maternal and fetal variables. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between the heart rate response to stimulation and three maternal variables: the degree of cervical dilation, the presence of ruptured membranes, and use of epidural anesthesia. The degree of fetal response did not correlate significantly with fetal distress at delivery or abnormal FHR tracings at the time of stimulation. Fewer than one-fifth of the fetuses manifested variable heart rate decelerations after the stimulation. In light of possible risks, the clinical use of the fetal acoustic stimulation test in labor should wait until its diagnostic value is better defined.\r"

The patients were randomly assigned to either cerclage (13) or conventional management (12). Cerclage patients had significantly better perinatal outcome, as indicated by more advanced gestational age at the time of delivery (34.9 +/- 3.0 versus 31.6 +/- 2.9 weeks; P = .02), larger birth weight (2709 +/- 511 versus 1812 +/- 506 g; P = .002), and fewer neonatal complications (two of 13 versus ten of 12 infants; P = .001). Maternal bleeding was more frequent and severe for patients in the control group. The total hospital cost was less for cerclage patients than for those receiving conventional expectant management ($9898 +/- 3943 versus $27,271 +/- 9901; P = .02). These results support the use of cervical cerclage for the treatment of patients with symptomatic placenta previa early in gestation.\r"

Expectant management was seldom successful; only 20 (7%) of pregnancies with preterm ruptured membranes did not begin labor within 48 hours. The condition of preterm ruptured membranes was also frequently associated with other obstetric complications such as twins, breech presentation, chorioamnionitis, and fetal heart rate decelerations in labor. We conclude that preterm ruptured membranes is an uncommon but complex obstetric problem that remains largely unsolved.\r"

Primiparas with relatively high concentrations of collagen and hyaluronic acid had relatively long cervical dilatation times during established labor, suggesting a physiologic importance to these variables. This correlation was not found in multiparas, even though the mean values of the biochemical parameters tested were similar to those in primiparas. Second-trimester biopsy specimens taken from patients with cervical incompetence contained normal collagen concentrations, but relatively high collagen extractabilities and collagenolytic activities, exceeding normal postpartum values. A biopsy specimen that was tested biomechanically had a very low strength and very high extensibility. Most likely, these data reflect a high turnover of collagen in incompetent cervices, resulting in a high proportion of newly synthesized collagen with low biomechanical strength.\r"

Elastances were significantly lower in groups having a clinically observed patulous cervix or laceration, or a clinically diagnosed incompetent cervix, than in the normal cervix group. No significant difference was found between the follicular and luteal phases for 64 regularly cycling women. Values were significantly reduced in women showing a widened cervix on a hysterosalpingogram when compared with those with a normal-appearing cervix.

Although Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedures yielded the most effective repair in the immediate postoperative period, Kelly plications were equally corrective more than three years after surgery (69 and 66%, respectively). Both were superior to the original Pereyra urethropexies at all times. Repeat operations were more likely to fail than primary repairs. The efficacy of the Pereyra procedure was increased with the use of permanent suture. Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedures were not affected by suture selection. Pereyra procedures had more complications, many related to intravesical suture. Success rates of all procedures declined steadily with lengthening periods of observation. We conclude that Kelly plications and Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedures have similar long-term efficacy and complication rates. The use of intra-operative cystoscopy and permanent suture with the Pereyra procedure might make it competitive.\r"

Patients were stratified into groups indicating whether pelvic inflammatory disease was probable, possible, or unlikely, based upon endometrial biopsy and clinical criteria. Among 52 women who were evaluated, Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae were initially recovered from 16 (67%) of 24 with probable pelvic inflammatory disease, three (33%) of 11 with possible pelvic inflammatory disease, and three (18%) of 17 in whom pelvic inflammatory disease was considered unlikely. Of the 24 patients with probable pelvic inflammatory disease, 22 (92%) were clinically cured or improved. Of 22 patients initially infected with C trachomatis and/or N gonorrhoeae, 20 were culture-negative for both organisms after therapy. Both microbiologic failures had been reexposed. This study suggests that the combination of cefoxitin and doxycycline is effective for ambulatory treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease.\r"

Histopathologic diagnoses included condyloma acuminatum, intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive cancer. In six patients, lesions of more than one pathologic type were identified. Vaginal lesions constituted less than 5% of tissues examined. Distribution of lesions was as follows: condyloma, 93 lesions from 57 patients; intraepithelial neoplasia, 47 lesions from 29 patients; and invasive carcinoma, 12 lesions from six patients. Seventy-five percent of the patients were white. The mean age of the patients increased from 25 years for condyloma to 38 years for vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia III to 56 years for invasive cancer. A viral diagnosis was made in 81% of condylomas, 84% of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia III, and 58% of invasive carcinomas. Distribution of viral types differed markedly for the various histopathologies. Types 6/11 accounted for 77% of condylomas and 0% of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia III. Type 16 was recovered from 12% of condylomas and 81% of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia III. Type 18 was identified in a small proportion in both categories; type 31 was seen in a few vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia III lesions. In invasive carcinomas, type 16 was the predominantly identified virus. Papillomavirus type 16 emerges as the dominant oncogenic virus in vulvar neoplasms. Its presence in a large percentage of condylomas raises the issue of an \"atypical condyloma\" as a precursor of neoplasia.\r"

The sensitivity of the proline aminopeptidase assay was 83 and 79%, respectively, in patients having bacterial vaginosis with and without Mobiluncus morphotypes. In contrast, gas-liquid chromatography of short-chain organic acids had sensitivities of 71 and 30%, respectively. Specificity of both assays was about 95%.

After criteria for exclusion were applied, 223 patients were analyzed further. Results from office and operating room curettage were compared with findings at hysterectomy. Twenty percent of cases showed an increase in grade at hysterectomy after office curettage; 15% showed upgrading after operating room curettage, a nonsignificant difference. We conclude that the techniques have equivalent accuracy in the determination of tumor grade. However, despite their well-documented reliability in tumor detection, a 15-20% upgrade suggests that frozen section confirmation of grade and depth of invasion in the hysterectomy specimen may be necessary if further surgical staging is not already planned.\r"

At hCG concentrations below 4000 mIU/mL, the assay had no false-negative or false-positive results; above 6500 mIU/mL, there were also no false-negative or false-positive results. In the range of 4000-6500 mIU/mL, the clinical false-positive rate was 28%.

An optical zone of 4.0 mm was used and eight incisions were made. Eight weeks after RK the cats were divided into three groups, subjected respectively to BB velocities of 148.5 ft/sec (N = 4), 190 ft/sec (N = 5), and 240 ft/sec (N = 13). In groups 1 and 2, all nine eyes had hyphemas and no eyes perforated. In group 3, four of 13 RK eyes had corneal rupture. All control eyes had hyphemas and none ruptured. The study suggests that RK can predispose to rupture eyes exposed to projectile trauma sufficient to produce hyphema.\r"

These images can be analyzed using a modified digital interactive mapping program to generate stereometric parameters, contour maps, section profiles, pallor maps, depth maps, and three-dimensional topographic plots of the retina. A skeletonizing program permits determination and measurement of shifts in the position of retinal vessels. The system's wide range of capabilities may be helpful in improving patient care and ophthalmic research.\r"

The surgical technique employed in all these cases used a large custom-designed, C-shaped conformer wrapped with a full-thickness oral mucous membrane graft. After all cicatricial tissue within the socket was excised, the wrapped conformer was sutured at its midperiphery to the inferior and superior orbital rims. In contrast to other procedures using flatter conformers, which direct their force in a vertical dimension, this uniquely designed conformer directs its force both vertically and deeply posteriorly within the socket. A somewhat modified but similar conformer also can be used for sockets compromised by total symblepharon formation. Excluding six patients with inadequate follow-up, we were able to successfully reform spacious and stable fornices in 40 of 41 severely contracted sockets. The average postoperative follow-up after reconstruction in these cases was 23.9 months. This technique represents an effective approach to successfully reconstruct and maintain stable ocular cul-de-sacs in cases of severe socket contracture or total symblepharon formation.\r"

All three compounds are potent competitive inhibitors of heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of heme to bilirubin, and can suppress completely or diminish significantly experimentally induced or naturally occurring forms of jaundice in animals or man. The results of these studies show that all three compounds have long-lived triplet states which are quenched by molecular oxygen both in solution and when incorporated in liposomes. However, the addition of quenching groups such as iodine to the porphyrin macrocycle results in a marked (approximately 60%) decrease in the triplet yield and a threefold decrease in the triplet lifetime. The triplet yield was shown to be independent of the excitation wavelength, and as a result, the metalloporphyrins were extremely poor photosensitizers when excited in the spectral region commonly used in phototherapy. In the presence of serum albumin, the triplet state of Sn-protoporphyrin was not quenched by oxygen. These results indicate that Sn-porphyrins can be custom designed with considerably reduced photosensitizing properties for potential clinical use as inhibitors of bilirubin production.\r"

A serum bilirubin concentration greater than 12.9 mg/dL was associated strongly with breast-feeding (P = .0000) and percentage of weight loss after birth (P = .0001), as well as with maternal diabetes, oriental race, decreased gestational age, male sex, bruising, and induction of labor with oxytocin. Risk ratios and the risk of jaundice were calculated for hypothetical infants in the presence and absence of these variables. These calculations show that, in certain infants, \"nonphysiologic\" jaundice is likely to develop and its presence in such infants might not require laboratory investigations. In others, a modest degree of hyperbilirubinemia could be cause for concern. An awareness of these factors and their potential contribution to serum bilirubin levels permits a more rational approach to the action levels used for the investigation of jaundice in the newborn.

The adolescents had no prior experience with exercise training. The 45-minute program, designed by a physical therapist, consisted of a stretching, calisthenics, and \"cool-down\" routine set to popular music. It was taught to the youngsters in group sessions. Each adolescent was given audio- and videocassettes of the routine for home use that emphasized self-motivation in maintaining training. The youngsters were asked to exercise three times per week and were also taught how to adjust their insulin and diet for exercise. Aerobic fitness was determined by maximal oxygen uptake following a vigorous, continuous progressive cycling test; metabolic control was measured by glycosylated hemoglobin values. All of the adolescents reported greater than 85% completion of the program. The youngsters displayed a correspondingly significant increase in aerobic fitness as measured by maximal oxygen uptake: 40.39 +/- 8.87 v 44.86 +/- 12.89 mL/kg/min. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels (mean +/- SD) for the entire group were significantly reduced after the program (11.41 +/- 4.47% v 10.01 +/- 3.21%). Results of this study indicate that nonathletic adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus can engage in self-motivated exercise training at home. If properly designed, such programs can improve aerobic fitness and may contribute to improvement in diabetes control.\r"

  ".W": "In industrialized societies, the unique pattern of crying in the first three months is \"unexplained\" but thought to be due to different biobehavioral factors from later crying behavior. To increase the range of the feeding and caretaking behaviors hypothesized to be relevant determinants of early crying, home observations and diary records were analyzed from samples of two subcultures of American middle-class women (La Leche League and \"standard care\" mothers; each n = 16) differing primarily in such practices. Both during and after the early crying stage, frequently fed infants cried or fretted less often (8.1 v 15.8 episodes per hour at 2 months of age; 10.7 v 16.6 episodes per hour at 4 months of age), and fewer of them exhibited rhythmic crying behavior (four v 11 at 2 months; eight v 13 at 4 months) during observations. However, only during the early crying period at 2 months were interval between feedings and maternal response latency shown to be independent determinants of cry/fret frequency (overall r2 = .35, P = .01), each factor accounting for approximately half of the explained individual variance. Furthermore, feeding interval was the only variable associated with rhythmic crying behavior at 2 months of age (r2 = .20;P = .01). In similar analyses at 4 months, there were no significant relationships with later crying or fretting. The results suggest that, in the presence of variation in feeding practice greater than that which is typical for our society, feeding interval may be a significant factor in early (but not later) crying behavior; furthermore, this effect is independent of and additive to the soothing effect of short response latency.\r"

By 8 years, circumcised children had a rate of 11.1 problems per 100 children, and uncircumcised children had a rate of 18.8 per 100. The majority of these problems were for penile inflammation including balanitis, meatitis, and inflammation of the prepuce. However, the relationship between risks of penile problems and circumcision status varied with the child's age. During infancy, circumcised children had a significantly higher risk of problems than uncircumcised children, but after infancy the rate of penile problems was significantly higher among the uncircumcised. These associations were not changed when the results were adjusted statistically for the effects of a series of potentially confounding social and perinatal factors.\r"

  ".U": "88176279\r", 
  ".W": "In this study, the determinants of an apparent increase in the infant mortality rate of an urban population with high access to tertiary neonatal care are reviewed. For a 4-year period (1980 to 1983), all infant deaths (n = 422) of the 32,329 births to residents of the City of Boston were analyzed through linked vital statistics data and a review of medical records. A significant increase in the infant mortality rate occurred in 1982 due to increases in three components of the infant mortality rate: the birth rate of very low birth weight infants (less than 1,500 g), the neonatal mortality rate of normal birth weight infants (greater than or equal to 2,500 g), and the mortality rate of infants dying during the postneonatal period (28 to 365 days). These increases were associated with inadequate levels of prenatal care. Although transient, the impact of the observed alterations in these infant mortality rate components was enhanced by a more long-standing phenomenon: the stabilization of mortality rates for low birth weight infants. This stabilization allowed the increases in other component rates to be expressed more fully than in previous years. In this report a mechanism is shown whereby fully regionalized neonatal care ultimately may confer to the infant mortality rate a heightened sensitivity to socioeconomic conditions and levels of adequate prenatal care.\r"

It also documented that many elements in the administration of enteral medications vary significantly among nurses, although nursing personnel expressed confidence in the efficacy of their individual drug administration techniques. Further quantitative evaluations of the efficacy of practices of enteral drug administration must be performed before meaningful standardization of drug administration techniques can be accomplished.\r"

No case of pruritic rash associated with cat scratch disease has been previously reported. In fact, one authority specifically states that the rash of cat scratch disease is nonpruritic. We report a well-documented case of cat scratch disease in which the patient's principal symptom was a pruritic rash. It is possible that this rash was the result of an immunologic reaction to the infectious agent of cat scratch disease. We conclude that cat scratch disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of pruritic rashes in children.\r"

Two distinct types of families were identified. Fifteen families showed high internal cohesion, expressiveness, and organization and low levels of conflict. Six families showed high overt conflict with low levels of family cohesion, expressiveness, and organization. In all families parental enmeshment with the patient was present. Marital discord was present in 12 families. Thirteen patients had significant school problems (ten had learning disabilities). Although most of the children were described as especially bright, only four had above average intelligence test scores. Four had a history of sexual abuse. The patients and their mothers perceived the health problem as significantly worse than did children with arthritis from whom similar scores had been obtained. Possible role models with similar symptoms were reported by ten patients. These data support the concept that childhood reflex neurovascular dystrophy is frequently a stress-related disease; the therapeutic approach to treating these children and their families must take these psychosocial factors into account.\r"

In contrast to the 1970s, most patients now receive cardiac pacing devices subsequent to the diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome. However, since this condition is prevalent in elderly patients, it is crucial that indications for pacing be critically evaluated and pacing recommended only for those with documented symptoms or marked abnormalities indicative of high risk for a subsequent cardiac event. This is particularly important because pacing has not been shown to influence survival in these patients. The technological advances in pacing devices during the last ten years now provide many desirable options. As a result, available pacemakers range from very simple to highly complex; accordingly, they have a wide range of prices. It is more important than ever to carefully select the appropriate pacing device for a given patient, since its cost, longevity, and required follow-up may differ greatly.\r"

Until recently, a limited number of antiarrhythmic drugs were available to the practicing physician, but during the last four years, seven new ones were approved. However, these drugs are complex and have different mechanisms of action and potential for adverse effects, so the safety of therapy with them continues to be debated. Although there is little doubt that many of the new drugs (particularly flecainide [Tambocor] and encainide [Enkaid]) are highly effective in suppressing ventricular premature complexes, they should be used with caution, since they also carry a potential for worsening arrhythmia (proarrhythmic effect) and congestive heart failure. Since suppression of arrhythmia has not yet been proven to reduce mortality, care must be taken in evaluating the risk-benefit ratio when prescribing therapy, particularly for patients with less malignant arrhythmias. Careful evaluation of the effects of treatment in individual patients is indicated whenever antiarrhythmic drugs are used. Until important mortality trials have been completed (eg, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial), therapy should be conservative and reserved for patients with severely symptomatic or malignant arrhythmias.\r"

Although previous reports failed to show any significant effect of treatment on mortality in patients with CHF, results of recent studies are encouraging.

Lethal ventricular arrhythmias are probably best managed with invasive electrophysiologic testing. Quantitative Holter monitoring is essential both before starting antiarrhythmic therapy to establish a baseline and after starting therapy to determine whether treatment is effective, ineffective, or causing proarrhythmia. Whether adequate suppression of ventricular arrhythmias prevents sudden cardiac death is still unknown but is currently being evaluated by the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda.

If these measures are unsuccessful and underlying disease is excluded, laxative use may be considered. Selection of the most appropriate cathartic for the clinical situation is vital. Bulk-forming laxatives and lactulose are favored. Dietary and drug intake should be discussed with the patient and constipating items eliminated when possible. Enema therapy may be necessary to retrain or evacuate an atonic, constipated colon. The mnemonic, right, summarizes the major points in treating constipation.\r"

  ".U": "88176881\r", 
  ".W": "N2-fixing root nodules of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) convert atmospheric N2 to ammonia(um) in an energy-intensive enzymatic reaction. These nodules synthesize large quantities of purines because nitrogen fixed by bacteria contained within this tissue is transferred to the shoots in the form of ureides, which are degradation products of purines. In animal systems, it has been proposed that proline biosynthesis by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR) is used to generate the NADP+ required for the synthesis of the purine precursor ribose 5-phosphate. We have examined the levels, properties, and location of P5CR and proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) in soybean nodules. Nodule P5CR was found in the plant cytosol. Its activity was substantially higher than that reported for other animal and plant tissues and is 4-fold higher than in pea (Pisum sativum) nodules (which export amides). The Km for NADPH was lower by a factor of 25 than the Km for NADH, while the Vmax with NADPH was one-third of that with NADH. P5CR activity was diminished by NADP+ but not by proline. These characteristics are consistent with a role for P5CR in supporting nodule purine biosynthesis rather than in producing proline for incorporation into protein. ProDH activity was divided between the bacteroids and plant cytosol, but less than 2% was in the mitochondria-rich fractions. The specific activity of ProDH in soybean nodule bacteroids was comparable to that in rat liver mitochondria. In addition, we propose that some of the proline synthesized in the plant cytosol by P5CR is catabolized within the bacteroids by ProDH and that this represents a novel mechanism for transferring energy from the plant to its endosymbiont.\r"

  ".W": "An analysis of the biochemical basis for the lack of phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase activity in heterofermentative lactobacilli was carried out. Extracts of Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus buchneri failed to reconstitute phosphotransferase activity of extracts of Staphylococcus aureus mutants impaired in the phosphotransferase system due to the absence of enzyme I, enzyme IILac, or enzyme IIILac activity, suggesting that these lactobacilli lack those phosphotransferase system components. In contrast, complementation tests with an extract of a S. aureus mutant deficient in heat-stable protein (HPr) indicated the presence of HPr activity in heterofermentative lactobacilli. The HPr of L. brevis was purified and shown to have properties similar to those of a typical HPr. In addition, L. brevis possesses an ATP-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates a serine residue of the endogenous HPr as well as other HPrs of Gram-positive origin. The kinase activity is markedly stimulated by phosphorylated compounds related to sugar metabolism and is negatively modulated by orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, or arsenate and by a low molecular weight endogenous factor. In keeping with the idea of a regulatory role for the phosphorylation of HPr in lactobacilli, a HPr[Ser(P)] phosphatase activity in L. brevis was also demonstrated. On the basis of the finding of HPr and a system for its reversible covalent modification in an organism devoid of a functional phosphotransferase system we propose that, in lactobacilli, HPr has a role in the regulation of pathways other than the phosphotransferase system.\r"

  ".W": "A number of premature translation termination mutations (nonsense mutations) have been described in the human alpha- and beta-globin genes. Studies on mRNA isolated from patients with beta zero-thalassemia have shown that for both the beta-17 and the beta-39 mutations less than normal levels of beta-globin mRNA accumulate in peripheral blood cells. (The codon at which the mutation occurs designates the name of the mutation; there are 146 codons in human beta-globin mRNA.) In vitro studies using the cloned beta-39 gene have reproduced this effect in a heterologous transfection system and have suggested that the defect resides in intranuclear metabolism. We have asked if this phenomenon of decreased mRNA accumulation is a general property of nonsense mutations and if the effect depends on the location or the type of mutation. Toward this end, we have studied the effect of five nonsense mutations and two missense mutations on the expression of human beta-globin mRNA in a heterologous transfection system. In all cases studied, the presence of a translation termination codon correlates with a decrease in the steady-state level of mRNA. The data suggest that the metabolism of a mammalian mRNA is affected by the presence of a mutation that affects translation.\r"

Immunoaffinity-purified, labeled T antigen was bound to SV40 DNA-cellulose and treated with Pronase E. A \"core\" region representing amino acids 140 to about 281 was identified by peptide mapping in the fraction that remained bound to the DNA-cellulose after treatment with a high (135 micrograms/ml) concentration of enzyme. This region corresponds to the DNA-binding domain of the protein molecule. After treatment with Pronase E at 66 micrograms/ml, the bound fraction consisted of the DNA-binding domain and a region that extends to residue 371. This larger protein segment binds more stably to the viral DNA than does the core by itself. At lower concentrations of Pronase E, additional sequences from the NH2-terminal region of T antigen and from the COOH-half of the molecule were observed in the bound fractions. Linear maps of resistant regions, generated for each concentration of protease used, provide information about the geometry of the protein molecule associated with the DNA. I suggest that regions that are easily cleaved by the protease are exposed in the DNA-protein complex, whereas those that remain bound to the DNA at increasing concentrations of the enzyme represent segments that are in progressively closer proximity to the viral DNA origin.\r"

PMA induces translocation of [35S]methionine-prelabeled cytosolic protein kinase C to membranes, followed by complete degradation of the enzyme (t1/2, 2 hr). PMA does not affect the protein kinase C synthesis; 20-80% of total protein kinase C of control cells was still immunoprecipitable as membrane-bound 74- and 80-kDa protein kinase C-related polypeptides if cells were allowed to incorporate [35S]methionine during PMA exposure for greater than 6 hr. These two proteins lack protein kinase activity and phorbol ester binding but reveal V8 peptide patterns identical to the active forms of protein kinase C (77/80 kDa) of PMA-untreated cells. The amounts of the immunoprecipitable membrane-bound 80-kDa protein kinase C-related polypeptide synthesized during the prolonged PMA treatment appear to inversely correlate with the extent of PMA-mediated growth inhibition of the respective human breast cancer cell line. These data suggest that after homologous down-regulation, functional protein kinase C (77/80 kDa) is replaced by a population of membrane-associated but enzymatically inactive protein kinase C-related polypeptides (74/80 kDa).\r"

Mouse antisera (MC-2, MC-3, MC-4) blocked the secretion of PTH from parathyroid cells incubated with 0.5 mM Ca2+ ions. Affinity-purified MC-4 antibodies inhibited PTH release in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubation of parathyroid cells with pertussis toxin markedly reduced MC-4-dependent inhibition of PTH secretion. Parathyroid cell membrane proteins were fractionated by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under either reducing or nonreducing conditions and immunoblotted with MC-4 antiserum. Antibodies bound to one major band of protein with Mr approximately equal to 150,000. These results suggest that the antibodies bind to Ca2+-channel alpha subunits and act as agonists that open the channels and inhibit PTH release.\r"

In an in vitro assay on the RNA transcript this mutation causes a defect in splicing of the intron 6 sequence and in subsequent ligation of the exon 6-exon 7 sequences. Using polymerase-amplified genomic DNA and allele-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probes, we have also shown that the sequence of this intron 6/exon 7 splice junction is normal in a different, unrelated analbuminemic individual. Analbuminemia in humans is therefore the result of one of multiple defects in our genome.\r"

A lambda phage cDNA expression library prepared from human erythroleukemia cells (HEL cells) was screened with a radiolabeled affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to the beta chain of GPIb. Eighteen positive clones were isolated and plaque-purified and the nucleotide sequences of three were determined. The composite sequence spanned 968 nucleotides and included a 5' untranslated region of 22 nucleotides, an open reading frame of 618 nucleotides encoding a signal peptide of 28 amino acids and a mature protein of 181 amino acids, a stop codon, and a 3' noncoding region of 307 nucleotides. The 3' noncoding sequence also contained a polyadenylylation signal (AATAAA) 14 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tail of 18 nucleotides. Edman degradation of the intact beta chain and of peptides produced by chemical cleavage yielded amino acid sequences spanning 76 residues that were identical to those predicted from the cDNA. The amino-terminal region of the beta chain contains a leucine-rich sequence of 24 amino acids that is similar to a sequence that occurs as seven tandem repeats in the alpha chain of GPIb and nine tandem repeats in leucine-rich alpha 2-glycoprotein. The leucine-rich sequence in the beta chain of GPIb is flanked on both sides by amino acid sequences that are similar to those flanking the leucine-rich tandem repeats of the alpha chain of GPIb and leucine-rich alpha 2-glycoprotein. The amino-terminal region of the beta chain of GPIb is followed by a transmembrane segment of 25 amino acids and an intracellular segment of 34 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. The intracellular segment contains an unpaired cysteine and two potential sites for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.\r"

The network is explicitly constructed, analyzed, and simulated. Such a network may account for the cognitive effect of the automatic counting of chimes to tell the hour. A more general implication is that different electrophysiological responses to identical stimuli, at certain stages of cortical processing, do not necessarily imply synaptic modification, a la Hebb. Such differences may arise from the fact that consecutive identical inputs find the network in different stages of an active temporal sequence of cognitive states. These types of networks are then situated within a program for the study of cognition, which assigns the detection of meaning as the primary role of attractor neural networks rather than computation, in contrast to the parallel distributed processing attitude to the connectionist project. This interpretation is free of homunculus, as well as from the criticism raised against the cognitive model of symbol manipulation. Computation is then identified as the syntax of temporal sequences of quasi-attractors.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of quaternary structure on the individual kinetic steps in the binding of carbon monoxide to the alpha subunit of hemoglobin, time-resolved absorption spectra were measured after photodissociation of carbon monoxide from a hemoglobin tetramer in which cobalt was substituted for iron in the beta subunits. Cobalt porphyrins do not bind carbon monoxide. Spectra were measured in the Soret region at room temperature after time delays that varied from a few nanoseconds to the completion of ligand rebinding at about 100 ms. The results show that the liganded molecule, alpha(Fe-CO)2 beta(Co)2, is in the R state, but can be almost completely switched into the T state by the allosteric effectors inositol hexaphosphate and bezafibrate. The geminate yield, which is the probability that the ligand rebinds to the heme from within the protein, is found to be 40% for the R state and less than 1% for the T state. According to the simplest kinetic model, these results indicate that carbon monoxide enters the protein in the R and T quaternary conformations at the same rate, and that the 60-fold decrease in the overall binding rate, of carbon monoxide to the alpha subunit in the T state compared to the R state is almost completely accounted for by the decreased probability of binding after the ligand has entered the protein. The results further suggest that the low probability for the T state results from a decreased binding rate to the heme and not from an increased rate of return of the ligand to the solvent.\r"

To determine the C14-C15 conformation in BR's L550 intermediate, we have examined the resonance Raman spectra of BR derivatives regenerated with retinal deuterated at the 14 and 15 positions. Vibrational calculations show that the C14-2H and C15-2H rocking modes form symmetric (A) and antisymmetric (B) combinations in [14,15-2H]retinal chromophores. When there is a trans conformation about the single bond between C14 and C15 (14-s-trans), a small frequency separation or splitting is observed between the A and B modes, which are found at approximately equal to 970 cm-1. In 14-s-cis molecules, the splitting is large, and the Raman-active symmetric A mode is predicted at approximately equal to 850 cm-1. In addition, the monodeuterium rock should appear at an unusually low frequency (920-930 cm-1) in the 14-2H-labeled 14-s-cis molecules. These patterns are insensitive to computational details: similar results are predicted by a modified Urey-Bradley force field and by MNDO (modified neglect of differential overlap) calculations for twisted chromophores and for highly delocalized protonated Schiff base cations. Time-resolved resonance Raman spectra were obtained of BR's L550 intermediate regenerated with [14-2H]-, [15-2H]- and [14,15-2H]retinal. The symmetric A rock in L550 is found at 968 cm-1, within 4 cm-1 of the frequencies for the monodeuterio derivatives, and no scattering is observed between 800 and 940 cm-1. The rocking frequencies of deuterated L550 are within 5 cm-1 of those observed in BR568, which contains a 14-s-trans chromophore. These results show that L550 contains a 14-s-trans chromophore and suggest that only 14-s-trans structures are involved in the proton pumping photocycle of BR.\r"

  ".W": "Freshly isolated adult rat hepatocytes exhibit a flat, extended morphology when cultured on dried rat tail collagen in the presence of growth factors; they actively synthesize DNA and express high levels of cytoskeletal mRNAs and proteins (actin, tubulin, cytokeratins, vinculin, alpha-actinin, and desmoplakin), while exhibiting low levels of liver-specific mRNAs (albumin, alpha 1-inhibitor III, and alpha 1-antitrypsin) and limited synthesis and secretion of albumin. Hepatocytes cultured on hydrated gel matrix from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse tumor form small spherical aggregates and exhibit low DNA, cytoskeletal mRNA, and protein synthesis, while at the same time exhibiting elevated liver-specific mRNAs and albumin production; these cells, therefore, more nearly conform to the program of gene expression seen within the normal animal. Hepatocytes on hydrated rat tail collagen resemble those on dry collagen when cultured at low density, but at high density they form compact trabecular aggregates, synthesize negligible amounts of DNA, and maintain a pattern of gene expression resembling that of hepatocytes seeded on the EHS matrix. If cell morphology is compact, as on EHS or on hydrated rat tail collagen when densely populated, DNA synthesis and expression of cytoskeletal genes are low, while liver-specific mRNAs are abundant. When cells are extended the opposite is the case. Without the growth supplement DNA synthesis is low throughout but gene expression is little affected. These studies point to the importance of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in determining the differentiated phenotype of hepatocytes, and they reveal an inverse relationship between cytoskeletal and liver-specific protein expression.\r"

  ".W": "It has been hypothesized that bombesin-like peptides produced by small cell lung carcinomas may sustain deregulated proliferation through an autocrine mechanism. We have shown that the neuropeptide bombesin leads to the activation of a protein-tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates a 115-kDa protein (p115) associated with the bombesin receptor complex in mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. We now report that phosphotyrosine antibodies recognize a 115-kDa protein, phosphorylated on tyrosine, in four human small cell lung carcinoma cell lines producing bombesin but not in a nonproducer \"variant\" line. p115 from detergent-treated small cell lung carcinoma cells binds to bombesin-Sepharose and can be phosphorylated on tyrosine in the presence of radiolabeled ATP and Mn2+. As for the p115 immunoprecipitated from mouse fibroblast, the small cell lung carcinoma p115 can be phosphorylated in an immunocomplex kinase assay. However, the latter does not require the presence of exogenous bombesin for activity. Binding data, obtained by using radiolabeled ligand, suggest receptor occupancy in the cell lines producing bombesin. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that proliferation in some human small cell lung carcinoma lines is under autocrine control, regulated through activation of bombesin receptors.\r"

The protein kinase responsible for receptor phosphorylation is associated with this fraction and preferentially phosphorylates the ligand-occupied form of the receptor. 8-Azido[32P]cAMP labeling of the cell surface has shown that the cAMP receptor exists in two forms. A 45-kDa protein is predominant on unstimulated cells. cAMP stimulation results in an increased receptor phosphorylation such that the receptor migrates on NaDodSO4/PAGE as a 47-kDa protein. Phosphorylation of the chemotactic receptor is not detected in membrane preparations unless cAMP is added to the incubation mixture. Only under those conditions is the phosphorylated 47-kDa form observed. The requirement for cAMP reflects the fact that the kinase involved preferentially uses the ligand-occupied receptor as a substrate. In vitro phosphorylation of the receptor does not involve tyrosine residues. The enzyme does not appear to be a cAMP- or cGMP-dependent protein kinase nor is it sensitive to guanine nucleotides, Ca2+/calmodulin, Ca2+/phospholipid, or EGTA. Similarities with the beta-adrenergic receptor protein kinase are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We used molecular cloning to isolate a functional gene for mouse ornithine decarboxylase (OrnDCase; L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.17) from a cell line in which that gene had been selectively amplified. The position of the 5' terminus of the mRNA was identified, and the coding sequence was shown to be preceded by a 312- or 313-nucleotide (nt) untranslated leader. The latter is highly G + C rich, particularly in its 5'-most portion. The leader can be anticipated to have extensive and stable secondary structure. The transcription unit of the gene is of relatively small size, approximately equal to 6.2 kilobases (kb) from the start site to the proximal site of polyadenylylation. Sequence analysis of DNA near the transcription start position demonstrated the presence of a \"TATA\" box, but no \"CAAT\" box. Functional properties of the cloned gene were tested by transfecting it into cultured cells. Expression of the putative full-length gene efficiently conferred ornithine decarboxylase activity on recipient mutant cells deficient in that activity. To assess the function and strength of the OrnDCase promoter region and to delimit its boundaries, we used a transient expression assay. Upstream of a bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was placed a portion of the OrnDCase gene, including the presumed promoter region, spanning a region from approximately equal to 3.0 kb 5' of the site of transcription initiation to the first 250 nt of the transcript. When expressed in mouse NIH 3T3 cells, this OrnDCase genomic element was comparable in strength to the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter. A similar construct, truncated so as to retain only 264 base pairs of the OrnDCase gene 5' to the site of transcription start, yielded undiminished levels of expression.\r"

It was inserted into a Moloney murine leukemia provirus (Mo-MLV) deleted for the envelope gene to test for intracellular transposition of defective retroviruses [Mo-MLV(neo)RT]. NeoRT contains the selectable neo gene (which confers resistance to the drug G418), inactivated by a polyadenylylation sequence inserted between the neo promotor and coding sequence. The polyadenylylation sequence is flanked (on the antisense strand of the DNA) by a donor and an acceptor splice site so as to be removed upon passage of the provirus through an RNA intermediate. 3T3 cells transfected with the defective Mo-MLV(neo)RT provirus are sensitive to G418. After trans-complementation with Mo-MLV, viral transcripts confer resistance to G418 upon infection of test cells. In the resistant cells, the polyadenylylation sequence has been removed, as a result in most cases of precise splicing of the intronic domain. Retrotransposition of the defective Mo-MLV(neo)RT provirus was demonstrated by submitting transfected G418-sensitive clones to selection. Between 1 and 10 G418-resistant clones were obtained per 10(7) cells. Several possess additional copies, with evidence for precise removal of the intronic domain. By using target test cells in coculture experiments, extracellular intermediates of retrotransposition could not be detected.\r"

Three cDNA clones were isolated and analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence indicated that the human Fc gamma R protein is synthesized with a 34-amino acid leader and the mature protein is composed of 281 amino acids. The extracellular region of this Fc gamma R was divided into two domains, which were very similar to each other and to the corresponding regions of both mouse alpha and beta Fc gamma Rs and showed a clear relationship to immunoglobulin variable regions. One possible N-linked glycosylation site was found in each of the extracellular domains. The human Fc gamma R leader sequence was shown to be similar to the mouse alpha Fc gamma R leader sequence, but the transmembrane region was most similar to the mouse beta 1 Fc gamma R. The intracellular domain of the human Fc gamma R was surprisingly different from both mouse Fc gamma Rs. RNA blot analysis of human cells demonstrated two transcripts (2.5 and 1.5 kilobases) that arise by use of different adenylylation signals. The cellular expression of these transcripts suggest that they encode the low-affinity p40 Fc gamma R protein.\r"

Previous studies have suggested an important role for this protein in physiological T-cell activation. Using oligonucleotide probes, we have now isolated a cDNA clone whose predicted sequence would encode a protein with an NH2-terminal sequence identical to that of the TAP molecule. Further analysis of the predicted protein sequence revealed a cysteine-rich protein with a hydrophobic domain at the COOH terminus and without N-linked glycosylation sites--all features consistent with our previous analysis of the TAP protein. In Southern blot analysis, the Ly-6.2 cDNA clone detects a multigene family and a restriction fragment length polymorphism that maps precisely to the Ly-6 locus. Expression of the cDNA clone in COS cells demonstrates that it codes for TAP and clarifies the relationship between the epitopes recognized by various alpha Ly-6 monoclonal antibodies. Finally, we have studied the expression of Ly-6 mRNA in a variety of cell lineages. Ly-6 transcripts were detected in all organs examined, including spleen, kidney, lung, brain, and heart. This demonstrates that the Ly-6 locus is transcriptionally active in a wide range of organs and suggests that the role of TAP or TAP-like proteins might extend to other tissues.\r"

Lamins A and C, which were not observed in lymphocytes, were also substrates of phorbol-stimulated phosphorylation in those cell types that express them. Lamin B phosphopeptides labeled with 32P in intact cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were compared to those produced by in vitro phosphorylation with protein kinase M, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. The phosphopeptides labeled by in vivo stimulation with phorbol esters are very similar to those phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase M, a catalytic domain of protein kinase C. Phorbol treatment of interphase cells significantly reduces the amount of detergent-insoluble lamin B, suggesting that phosphorylation of lamin may alter the architecture of the nuclear lamina. In addition, we have shown that treatment of a B-cell line with antibodies to IgM induces a modest increase in lamin B phosphorylation. These results strongly suggest that ligands that are known to activate protein kinase C at the cell surface or in the cytosol also lead to the activation of a nuclear kinase activity with a protein kinase C-type specificity.\r"

We here demonstrate that human lung mast cells of 96% purity incorporate [35S] sulfate into separate heparin and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in an approximately equal to 2:1 ratio. As assessed by HPLC of the chondroitinase ABC digests, the chondroitin [35S]sulfate proteoglycans isolated from these human lung mast cells contain the same unusual chondroitin sulfate E disaccharide that is present in proteoglycans produced by interleukin 3-dependent mucosal-like mouse mast cells. Both the chondroitin [35S]sulfate E proteoglycans and the [35S]heparin proteoglycans were exocytosed from the [35S]sulfate-labeled cells via perturbation of the IgE receptor, indicating that both types of 35S-labeled proteoglycans reside in the secretory granules of these human lung mast cells.\r"

To examine possible direct effects of 17 beta-estradiol on bone-forming cells, we used pure rat osteoblast-like cells in vitro as a model. Osteoblast-like cells prepared from calvaria of newborn rats were cultured serum-free in methylcellulose-containing medium for 21 days. Osteoblast-like cells proliferate selectively into clonally derived cell clusters of spherical morphology. 17 beta-Estradiol at concentrations of 0.1 nM and 1 nM enhanced osteoblast-like cell proliferation by 41% and 68% above vehicle-treated controls. The biologically inactive stereoisomer 17 alpha-estradiol (same concentrations) had no effect. Moreover, the antiestrogen tamoxifen abolished the stimulation of osteoblast-like cell proliferation by 17 beta-estradiol. After 21 days of culture, RNA was prepared and analyzed in a dot-hybridization assay for the abundance of pro alpha 1(I) collagen mRNA. Steady-state mRNA levels were increased in cultures treated with 17 beta-estradiol in a dose-dependent manner with maximal stimulation at 1 nM and 10 nM. At the same concentrations, the percentage of synthesized protein (labeled by [3H]proline pulse) that was digestible by collagenase was increased, indicating that 17 beta-estradiol acts at pretranslational levels to enhance synthesis of bone collagen. These data show that the osteoblast is a direct target for 17 beta-estradiol.\r"

We report here that [3H]metolazone, a diuretic with a thiazide-like mechanism of action, labels a site in rat kidney membranes that has characteristics of the thiazide-sensitive ion transporter. [3H]Metolazone bound with high affinity (Kd = 4.27 nM) to a site with a density of 0.717 pmol/mg of protein in kidney membranes. The binding site was localized to the renal cortex, with little or no binding in other kidney regions and 11 other tissues. The affinities of thiazide-type diuretics for this binding site were significantly correlated with their clinical potency. Halide anions (Cl-, Br-, and I-) specifically inhibited high-affinity binding of [3H]metolazone to this site. [3H]Metolazone also bound with lower affinity (Kd = 289 nM) to sites present in kidney as well as in liver, testis, lung, brain, heart, and other tissues. Calcium antagonists and certain smooth muscle relaxants had Ki values of 0.6-10 microM for these low-affinity sites, which were not inhibited by most of the thiazide diuretics tested.

DF3 antigen expression correlates with human breast tumor differentiation, and the detection of a cross-reactive species in human milk has suggested that this antigen might be useful as a marker of differentiated mammary epithelium. To further characterize DF3 antigen expression, we have isolated a cDNA clone from a lambda gt11 library by screening with mAb DF3. The results demonstrate that this 309-base-pair cDNA, designated pDF9.3, codes for the DF3 epitope. Southern blot analyses of EcoRI-digested DNAs from six human tumor cell lines with 32P-labeled pDF9.3 have revealed a restriction fragment length polymorphism. Variations in size of the alleles detected by pDF9.3 were also identified in Pst I, but not in HindIII, DNA digests. Furthermore, hybridization of 32P-labeled pDF9.3 with total cellular RNA from each of these cell lines demonstrated either one or two transcripts that varied from 4.1 to 7.1 kilobases in size. The presence of differently sized transcripts detected by pDF9.3 was also found to correspond with the polymorphic expression of DF3 glycoproteins. Nucleotide sequence analysis of pDF9.3 has revealed a highly conserved (G + C)-rich 60-base-pair tandem repeat. These findings suggest that the variation in size of alleles coding for the polymorphic DF3 glycoprotein may represent different numbers of repeats.\r"

As defined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, monoclonal antibody 40.10.09, which reacts with normal human glycosylase, neither recognized nor inhibited native uracil DNA glycosylase from any of five separate Bloom syndrome cell strains. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that the denatured glycosylase protein from all five Bloom syndrome cell strains was immunoreactive with the 40.10.09 antibody. Further, each native enzyme was immunoreactive with two other anti-human placental uracil DNA glycosylase monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, ELISA reactivity was observed with all three monoclonal antibodies in reactions of glycosylases from 5 normal human cell types and 13 abnormal human cell strains. These results experimentally verify the specificity of the aberrant reactivity of the Bloom syndrome uracil DNA glycosylase. The possibility arises that determination of the lack of immunoreactivity with antibody 40.10.09 may have value in the early diagnosis of Bloom syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Although cigarette smoking is one of the major risk factors for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, the precise mechanisms of its adverse effects have not been fully elucidated. We incubated low density lipoprotein (LDL) with cigarette smoke (CS) extract and examined the incorporation of the lipoprotein by macrophages in vitro. When incubated with macrophages, LDL pretreated with CS extract (100 micrograms/ml) stimulated cholesteryl [14C]oleate synthesis approximately equal to 12.5-fold that with unmodified LDL and transformed macrophages to cells rich in lipid droplets positively stained with oil red O. Enhancement in cholesteryl ester synthesis was dependent on the concentration of CS-modified LDL and exhibited saturation kinetics. When subjected to electrophoreses, CS-modified LDL migrated to a more anionic position than did unmodified LDL and showed extensive fragmentation of apolipoprotein B. This LDL modification depended upon the incubation time and concentration of the CS extract. Superoxide dismutase inhibited modification of LDL by 52%, suggesting that superoxide anion is, at least in part, involved. These results suggest that CS extract alters LDL into a form recognized and incorporated by macrophages. Such modification if it occurs in vivo, could explain the increased incidence of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in smokers.\r"

  ".W": "Nucleotide sequence analysis of a genomic clone from an Ashkenazic Jewish patient with type 1 Gaucher disease revealed a single-base mutation (adenosine to guanosine transition) in exon 9 of the glucocerebrosidase gene. This change results in the amino acid substitution of serine for asparagine. Transient expression studies following oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the normal cDNA confirmed that the mutation results in loss of glucocerebrosidase activity. Allele-specific hybridization with oligonucleotide probes demonstrated that this mutation was found exclusively in the type 1 phenotype. None of the 6 type 2 patients, 11 type 3 patients, or 12 normal controls had this allele. In contrast, 15 of 24 type 1 patients had one allele with this mutation, and 3 others were homozygous for the mutation. Furthermore, some of the Ashkenazic Jewish type 1 patients had only one allele with this mutation, suggesting that even in this population there is allelic heterozygosity. These findings indicate that there are multiple allelic mutations responsible for type 1 Gaucher disease in both the Jewish and non-Jewish populations. Allelic-specific hybridization demonstrating this mutation in exon 9, used in conjunction with the Nci I restriction fragment length polymorphism described as a marker for neuronopathic Gaucher disease, provides a tool for diagnosis and genetic counseling that is approximately equal to 80% informative in all Gaucher patients studied.\r"

In individual patients, no difference was seen between the restriction length fragments of the two alleles of L-MYC [6-kilobase (kb) and 10-kb fragments in EcoRI digests] in lung cancer tissues and normal tissues. But a striking correlation was found between the restriction length fragment polymorphism pattern of L-MYC and the extent of metastasis, particularly to the lymph nodes at the time of surgery: Patients with only the L band (10 kb) had few lymph node metastatic lesions, whereas patients with either the S band (6 kb) or the S and L bands almost always had lymph node metastatic lesion. A similar correlation was found between the presence of the S band and metastases to other organs. This correlation was particularly marked in cases of adenocarcinoma. These results indicate a clear genetic influence on metastases and a consequent poor prognosis for certain patients of lung cancer; L-MYC restriction length fragment polymorphism is thus shown to be a useful marker for predicting the metastatic potential of human lung cancer.\r"

Coconditioning of crossed and ipsilateral pathways resulted in LTP of the crossed system only when the current sinks of the two conditioned pathways overlapped sufficiently. Likewise, conditioning of an ipsilateral pathway alone resulted in LTD of the crossed pathway only when those current sinks overlapped sufficiently. These observations support the idea that associative events that lead to LTP or LTD can be restricted to a local dendritic domain. The postsynaptic cell can therefore serve as more than one unit of integration for synaptic modification.\r"

Sensory neurons from habituated animals had 35% fewer synaptic varicosities than did sensory neurons from control animals. In contrast, sensory neurons from sensitized animals had twice as many varicosities per sensory neuron compared to controls, as well as enlarged neuropil arbors. These changes suggest that modulation of synapse number may play a role in the maintenance of long-term memory.\r"

Receptors in the crude cortical membrane fragments were solubilized using 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), affinity purified, and reconstituted into lipid vesicles. [3H]5-HT binding analysis indicates a single class of high-affinity binding site (Kd, 16.9 nM) that was reconstituted. 5-Methoxytryptamine, a competitor for high-affinity serotonin sites, inhibited this binding and showed a Ki of 27.4 nM. Ketanserin, a high-affinity ligand for 5-HT2 type receptors, was ineffective in displacing [3H]5-HT binding at concentrations up to 4 microM indicating a 5-HT1 receptor as the primary receptor type isolated. The average specific activity of 359 pmol/mg in the reconstituted fractions is an enrichment of 1062-fold over crude membrane fragments. Sodium dodecyl-sulfate electrophoresis showed the presence of four proteins in the reconstituted vesicles with approximate relative Mr values of 63,000, 70,000, 81,000, and 94,000.\r"

  ".U": "88176951\r", 
  ".W": "Postnatal rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were identified with specific fluorescent labels and placed in culture. Under these conditions, the outgrowth of processes by RGCs was found to be promoted to a far greater degree by acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) than by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The effect of aFGF and bFGF on process extension by solitary RGCs was quantified after 24 hr in culture, a time when neither a FGF nor bFGF enhanced RGC survival. The action of aFGF on process outgrowth was markedly potentiated by the addition of heparin (10 micrograms/ml) to the medium, but heparin alone had no effect. In the presence of heparin, half-maximal process outgrowth occurred at an aFGF concentration of less than 20 pg/ml (1 pM). Since all of the centrally projecting processes have already been formed in the living animal prior to use (at 7-12 days of age), at least a portion of the process outgrowth in culture appears to represent a regenerative phenomenon. Statistical analysis of the increase in process growth revealed that aFGF with heparin contributed to both neurite initiation and elongation. The mean number of glial cells, identified with polyclonal antiserum against glial fibrillary acidic protein, was slightly increased in cultures receiving aFGF plus heparin, but this effect was variable, and these glial cells were not in contact with the solitary RGCs that were scored for regeneration of processes. Thus, glial cells probably did not exert a direct physical influence on the degree of process outgrowth observed in the solitary RGCs, although a humoral effect cannot be totally excluded. These results suggest that aFGF has a potent influence on the outgrowth of processes by a neuron in the mammalian central nervous system. The potentiation of this effect by heparin leads us to speculate that the interaction of aFGF with a heparin-like molecule located in the extracellular matrix (such as heparan sulfate proteoglycan) may produce physiological effects in vivo. Furthermore, the lack of a substantial effect of bFGF in this system under these conditions shows that a specific population of mammalian central neurons may be differentially influenced by these two closely related peptide growth factors.\r"

(ii) The single channel open and closed lifetimes are in the ms time range. (iii) The synthetic channel discriminates cations over anions but is nonselective between Na+ and K+. However, the synthetic channel displays no significant voltage dependence. Energetic considerations suggest a bundle of four parallel amphipathic alpha-helices as the most plausible channel structure. The synthetic 22-mer channel-forming peptide allows study of the mechanisms of ion permeation through sodium channels by protein engineering techniques.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that vasopressin stimulates K, Mg, Ca, Cl, and Na reabsorption by the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TALH) of the rat kidney. Micropuncture of superficial nephrons and clearance experiments were performed to determine whether desensitization of the TALH to vasopressin may be demonstrated in vivo and whether such desensitization is specific for the effects of vasopressin (i.e., homologous) or also alters the response to the other hormones acting on the same pool of adenylate cyclase in this nephron segment. Brattleboro rats, with hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (DI), were given i.m. injections of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin (des-1-amino-[DArg8]VP (herein designated dDAVP); 2 micrograms/day) for 3 days. The effects of maximal physiological doses of arginine-8-vasopressin ([Arg8]VP (herein designated AVP); 20 pg/min per 100 g of body weight) were studied 2 days after the cessation of treatment, when the animals had returned to DI. The K, Mg, Ca, and, to a lesser extent, Cl and Na concentrations in the fluid leaving the TALH of superficial nephrons were higher in dDAVP-treated than in untreated rats given similar amounts of AVP during the experiments. A 50-60% desensitization of the TALH to AVP was still apparent 2 days after stopping the dDAVP injections. Desensitization is homologous, as judged from normal responses to physiological doses of glucagon and calcitonin, two hormones acting on the same cyclase pool as AVP in the rat TALH. The AVP-dependent increase of urine osmolality, however, indicated that its effects on the permeability to water of the collecting duct were scarcely affected in dDAVP-treated rats. It is concluded that (i) AVP induces homologous desensitization in the rat TALH and (ii) the TALH can be markedly desensitized to AVP when the collecting duct response to this hormone is poorly affected or even fully maintained.\r"

The whole-cell variation of the patch voltage clamp technique was used. Two types of Ca channels were found. One type is similar to the \"T-type\" Ca channels found in many excitable cells. These channels deactivate slowly (tau approximately equal to 7 ms at -75 mV) and inactivate rapidly during strong depolarizations. The second channel type activates and inactivates at more positive potentials than the T-type Ca channels and deactivates rapidly. These channels are similar to the \"L-type\" Ca channels found in muscle and nerve. Our studies provide three reasons for concluding that T-type Ca channels have an important role in mediating stimulus-secretion coupling in response to high K+ or AII: (i) aldosterone secretion and steady-state current through T-type Ca channels are biphasic functions of Ko and both increase in parallel for Ko = 2-10 mM; (ii) nitrendipine blocks the T-type Ca channels and the stimulation of aldosterone secretion by high K+ or AII with similar potency; (iii) AII increases Ca entry through the T-type Ca channels.\r"

A decrease in the H-reflex was interpreted as a depression in motoneuron excitability, a condition conducive for reducing muscle tone. The H-reflex measurements were obtained before, during, immediately after, and 2.5 minutes after tendon pressure application. Piecewise linear regression equations were used to evaluate the effects of four pressure conditions. The mean of the midpoints of the lines for each pressure condition was compared with prepressure baseline values by t tests and with the other pressure conditions by an analysis of variance. All four pressure conditions demonstrated H-reflexes less than prepressure baseline values, with three of the four conditions (5 and 10 kg of intermittent pressure and 5 kg of continuous pressure) being significantly less than prepressure baseline values (p less than .05). The analysis of variance revealed a significant difference among pressure conditions. Scheffe post hoc contrast comparisons revealed significant differences between intermittent and continuous pressure but not between 5 and 10 kg of pressure. The results of this study indicate that in these hemiparetic subjects, the H-reflex was depressed during both continuous and intermittent tendon pressure. Intermittent pressure was more effective then continuous, but 10 kg of pressure had no greater effect than 5 kg of pressure. The effects of pressure lasted only as long as the stimulus was present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A posturally induced \"stretch weakness\" of the right hip abductor muscles has been reported in many healthy right-handed persons in the literature. The purpose of this study was to test for differences in the maximal isometric hip abduction torque produced between hip sides across multiple hip abduction angles. The torques were measured on 40 healthy right-handed individuals using a specialized torque-testing table at hip abduction angles of -10, 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 degrees. Statistical analysis of the results did not demonstrate a specific \"weakness\" of the right hip abductor muscles at the hip angle used to clinically test them. The results, however, did demonstrate statistically significant differences in the torque-hip angle slopes across hip sides. We hypothesized that these slope differences may result from muscle adaptation to lengths imposed by standing posture. We discuss how manual muscle testing procedures may bias the likelihood of encountering stretch weakness in muscles that are habitually maintained at near-maximal elongation.\r"

Ninety-nine first-year students and 88 second-year students responded to the inventory, representing a return rate of 88%. The results of both groups were compared. Further comparisons were made with reported normative inventory scores and with inventory results reported of first-year students in a medical problem-based school. All comparisons were made using two-tailed t tests. The inventory scores proved similar in both year groups of physical therapy students and were more desirable than the normative values. The first-year physical therapy students' scores were similar to those of the first-year medical students reported to be desirable. It was concluded that the physical therapy students possess desirable approaches to studying.\r"

A questionnaire was sent to the directors of 96 entry-level physical therapy curricula, and 76 directors responded. Most of the respondents (98.7%) indicated that burn and cancer management warranted lectures. The programs that quantified instruction averaged 4.8 hours of burn-related medical and surgical lectures and 4.2 hours of burn-related physical therapy procedure lectures. The instructional time devoted to oncology was slightly less. Physicians presented the medical and surgical lectures in 36% of the curricula and provided instruction with physical therapists and nurses in 39% of the curricula. Physical therapists alone presented the lectures on physical therapy procedures in 83% of the curricula. Sixty-three percent of the respondents believed that new graduates could effectively treat both patients with burns and those with cancer, but other respondents attached various qualifiers to their responses. Some respondents thought that new graduates could not adequately treat patients with burns (12%) or cancer (8%). Suggestions for future physical therapy burn education are given.\r"

A one-page questionnaire was distributed to the program directors of 109 accredited entry-level physical therapy programs in the United States. Of the 95 respondents, 1 (1%) included a unit on CST only, 14 (15%) included a unit on MFR only, 14 (15%) included units on both CST and MFR, and 66 (69%) included neither. The highest percentages of programs with CST and MFR units were entry-level masters' degree programs and programs located in the Pacific Coast and Middle Atlantic regions. All of the units were presented within required courses, usually during the second year; most were taught by physical therapists. The greatest amount of instructional time was allotted for CST laboratory sessions (mean = 5.8 hours), and the least amount of time was allotted for MFR lectures (mean = 1.7 hours). The mos frequently cited reason for noninclusion of CST or MFR instruction was inadequate room in the current curricula. The most frequently requested materials were bibliographies and laboratory guides on CST and MFR. Implications of these findings are addressed, and suggestions for further research are given.\r"

The average age of the patients infected with these strains was 49 years (range, 21-76 years); the male-to-female ratio was 6.5. Twenty-five patients (83%) were employed in the pork industry. Two patients (7%) died. In seven cases (23%), predisposing factors were identified. The most frequent sequela was hearing loss (54% of surviving patients). The data for these 30 patients were compared with those for 30 patients from outside the Netherlands whose cases of meningitis due to S. suis type 2 were described between 1968 and 1985. No differences were found. The estimated annual risk of developing S. suis meningitis among Dutch abattoir workers and pig breeders was approximately 3.0/100,000--a rate 1,500 times higher than that among persons not working in the pork industry.\r"

Heterosexual partners of infected individuals appear to be at high risk of infection, but only a small proportion of cases of AIDS have been attributed to heterosexual contact in the United States and Europe. An epidemic model for heterosexual spread of HIV infection is developed and fit to surveillance data. Fitted values are restricted to a range consistent with findings from partner studies. Because, at present, most HIV-infected heterosexuals and bisexuals have been infected through other means (intravenous drug use or homosexual contact), the model considers two interacting populations: a small population of individuals rapidly infected by high-risk activity and a large population of individuals at risk only from heterosexual contact. No precise predictions concerning the AIDS epidemic among heterosexuals are possible now, but current epidemiologic findings neither predict nor preclude a major heterosexual epidemic. Projections depend strongly on the delay between infection and infectivity. The model can also be used to demonstrate how interpretation of results of case-control studies of HIV infection depends on underlying assumptions about the dynamics of the epidemic.\r"

The extent of the federal government's investment in AIDS-related research in relation to research investments in cancer, coronary heart disease, and unintentional injuries is examined. Appropriation levels for fiscal year 1986 are divided by indexes of projected disease burden for 1991 to create a research investment ratio for each health impairment. Indexes of disease burden include numbers of total deaths, early deaths, expected life years lost, and discounted life years lost and direct economic costs. Despite the uncertainty about the future of the AIDS epidemic, there is no indication that AIDS is being overfunded relative to cancer and heart disease. Injuries appear to receive relatively low funding priority. Confident conclusions about research priority depend upon resolution of qualitative considerations and better understanding of the dynamics of the AIDS epidemic.\r"

A step-forward logistic regression analysis defined eight variables independently influencing the outcome: shock, underlying rapidly fatal disease, high-risk source of bacteremia (intraabdominal, lower respiratory tract, or not identified), age more than 70 years, hospitalization in intensive care or medical units, inappropriate antibiotic treatment, infection due to a high-risk microorganism (P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, or Candida), and development of septic metastasis. The identification of those factors independently influencing the outcome and their possible modification may represent a further step in the control of nosocomial bacteremia by improving its prognosis.\r"

Seventeen patients died in hospital, but only in seven cases was the anorectal infection a major contributing cause of death. The most important prognostic indicator of outcome was number of days of neutropenia during the infectious episode. Cultures obtained at the time of surgical drainage or by needle aspiration of the wound revealed multiple organisms in 26 of 29 instances, and anaerobic organisms were the commonest isolates. Anorectal infection was controlled in 28 (55%) of 51 treatment courses when antibiotics were the only treatment given. However, if the antibiotic regimen included both an aminoglycoside and an antibiotic with anaerobic coverage, control of infection was observed in 15 (88%) of 17 cases. There were 26 surgical procedures performed, with acceptable morbidity. Infection was controlled in 19 (73%) of 26 cases treated with surgery and antibiotics. The results support managing most of these infections initially with medical treatment, using an antibiotic regimen that includes an aminoglycoside and a specific drug against anaerobes. Surgery is recommended if there is obvious fluctuance, a significant amount of necrotic tissue evident, or progression of the infection locally or continued sepsis after an adequate antibiotic trial.\r"

After 10 years, hunting success remained high and the kill rates for most prey did not suggest depletion. An array of environmental factors accounts for the incipient settlement relocation observed.\r"

The specificity of the reaction is mediated by a complex receptor, part of which is highly variable in sequence and analogous to immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain variable domains. The functional specificity of the T cell antigen receptor is, however, markedly different from immunoglobulins in that it mediates cell-cell interactions via the simultaneous recognition of foreign antigens and major histocompatibility complex-encoded molecules expressed on the surface of various lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells. The relation between the structure of the receptor and its functional specificity was investigated by analyzing the primary sequences of the receptors expressed by a series of T lymphocyte clones specific for a model antigen, pigeon cytochrome c. Within this set of T lymphocyte clones there was a striking selection for amino acid sequences in the receptor beta-chain in the region analogous to the third complementarity-determining region of immunoglobulins. Thus, despite the functional differences between T cell antigen receptors and immunoglobulin molecules, analogous regions appear to be important in determining ligand specificity.\r"

Apparently similar severe, unilateral lesions to the central visual pathways can result in two qualitatively different central visual field defects termed macular sparing and macular splitting. In macular sparing a 2 degrees to 3 degrees region around the fovea is spared from the effects of unilateral damage to the visual pathways. In macular splitting there is no such spared region and the scotoma produced by unilateral brain damage bisects the fovea. The patterns of decussation of the different classes of retinal ganglion cells in both New World (Saimiri sciureus) and Old World (Macaca fascicularis) monkeys have been determined by horseradish peroxidase injection. In both species the distributions of ipsilaterally and contralaterally projecting ganglion cells in the central retina are different from those in other mammals and suggest neural bases for macular sparing and splitting, respectively.\r"

To seek the molecular explanation of this effect, a study was made of the effects of length on Ca2+ sensitivity during tension development by isolated demembranated cardiac muscle in which the cardiac form of troponin C was substituted with skeletal troponin C. The results of troponin C exchange were compared at sarcomere lengths of 1.9 and 2.4 micrometers. Enhancement of the myocardial performance at the stretched length was greatly suppressed with the skeletal troponin C compared with the cardiac troponin C. Thus the troponin C subunit of the troponin complex that regulates the activation of actin filaments has intrinsic molecular properties that influence the length-induced autoregulation of myocardial performance and may be a basis for Starling's law of the heart.\r"

In this study of isolates of HIV-1 obtained at intervals during the infection of four individuals, the development of disease was found to be correlated with the emergence of HIV-1 variants that were more cytopathic in vitro as the disease progressed and that replicated more efficiently in a wide variety of different human cells. The biologic properties of HIV-1 in vitro thus appear to reflect its virulence in the host. Further studies of such sequentially isolated viruses may lead to the identification of viral genes that govern pathogenesis.\r"

The group differences in peripheral physiological reactions suggest that inherited variation in the threshold of arousal in selected limbic sites may contribute to shyness in childhood and even extreme degrees of social avoidance in adults.\r"

In order to separate the sequence information at the end of the processing, the DNA molecules of interest are ligated to a set of oligonucleotide \"tags\" at the beginning. The tagged DNA molecules are pooled, amplified, and chemically fragmented in 96-well plates. The resulting reaction products are fractionated by size on sequencing gels and transferred to nylon membranes. These membranes are then probed as many times as there are types of tags in the original pools, producing, in each cycle of probing, autoradiographs similar to those from standard DNA sequencing methods. Thus, each reaction and gel yields a quantity of data equivalent to that obtained from conventional reactions and gels multiplied by the number of probes used. To date, even after 50 successive probings, the original signal strength and the image quality are retained, an indication that the upper limit for the number of reprobings may be considerably higher.\r"

This conversion is an unusual form of protein modification in that it requires catalysis by an intramolecular reaction where both the substrate (asparagine and glutamine side chains) and \"catalytic site\" (the peptide nitrogen of the succeeding residue) are constituents of several consecutive residues along the polypeptide chain. The stereochemical factors governing this process were studied with a data base derived from the neutron crystallographic structure of trypsin from which amide groups and oxygen can be unambiguously differentiated because of their different neutron scattering properties. The neutron structure allowed for the direct determination of those residues that were deamidated; 3 of 13 asparagine residues were found to be modified. These modified residues were clearly distinguished by a distinct local conformation and hydrogen-bonding structure in contrast to those observed for the other asparagine residues. No correlation was found between preference to deamidate and the chemical character of residues flanking the site, as had been proposed from previous peptide studies.\r"

A novel gene was identified that is transcribed in all tissues tested and is located in mouse and man between the CA and Bf genes of the H-2 and HLA complexes, respectively. From the nucleotide sequence, derived from liver complementary DNA clones, it is predicted that this novel single-copy gene encodes a 42-kilodalton polypeptide that bears no recognizable relation to the protein families known so far, but it displays striking hallmarks of natural selection.\r"

The Mos factor, when introduced into the genome of the sibling species Drosophila simulans, exhibited a dramatic maternal effect on expression of the mosaic phenotype. When D. simulans mosaic females (heterozygous for Mos) were crossed with non-mosaic males, two distinct classes of mosaic offspring occurred, one resulting from a maternal effect in which the non-Mos offspring were nevertheless mosaic. The maternal effect was mediated by a product acting after fertilization, and was expressed to varying extents in different backcross strains.\r"

Histologic transformation into a histologically more aggressive lesion was noted in three patients. There was a higher incidence of recurrence among the younger patients (those less than 20 years of age) and in those with the larger tumors (greater than 5 centimeters diameter). The reasons for these findings are discussed. The phenomenon of recurrence was reviewed with regard to age of the patient, size of the lesion, histologic features of the tumor and extent of the operation.\r"

In group 2, CyA, a dose of 10 milligrams per kilogram, was given orally one day prior to, on the day of the operation and 24 hours after hepatectomy. The liver weight restoration, histologic findings and mitotic activities of remnant livers and serum levels of aminotransferase, albumin, total bilirubin and creatinine values were examined from 24 hours to ten days after the operation. Treatment with CyA resulted in an increase of the mitotic activities of the hepatocytes, which were twice as high as those in the control group. This phenomenon coincided well with the regenerative rate of remnant livers, histologic factors, albumin synthesis and other biochemical parameters. Our results indicate that CyA has a stimulatory effect upon liver cell proliferation after partial hepatectomy in rats. The augmentative effect of CyA on liver regeneration is discussed.\r"

Permanent unilateral vocal cord paralysis occurred in three patients and persistent symptomatic hypercalcemia occurred in another two. Twelve (4 per cent) of the patients had hyperparathyroid crisis and five (1.8 per cent) had carcinoma of the parathyroid gland. The mean follow-up time was six years. Removal of a single macroscopically enlarged gland, if the other glands are normal, is all that needs to be done in most instances. Subtotal parathyroidectomy should be preserved for those patients who have diffuse glandular hyperplasia.\r"

In a preliminary study from this laboratory, an elevation in the level of 6-Keto-prostaglandin-F1a, the stable metabolite of prostacyclin (PGI2) was demonstrated in femoral vein plasma obtained during surgical treatment from an extremity undergoing external pneumatic compression. Simultaneously, no elevations in thromboxane B2, the stable metabolite of thromboxane A2, were observed. The present study is an inclusive prospective series of 26 patients. A single pneumatic compression stocking was applied to the left limb in patients who underwent an operation under general anesthesia. Base line venous samples (3 milliliters) were obtained from the femoral vein on the experimental side and the control contralateral side, as well as from the upper limb. Additional samples were drawn at 30 and 60 minutes after the onset of compression. Nine samples per patient (234 total) were analyzed for 6-Keto-prostaglandin-F1a by competitive binding radioimmunoassay in duplicate in a single blind manner. Base line values for the upper limb, right leg and left leg were 0.08 + 0.01 nanogram per milliliter; 0.14 + 0.03 nanogram per milliliter, and 0.13 + 0.02 nanogram per milliliter, respectively (no statistical difference). By 60 minutes of compression, control samples increased to 0.40 + 0.07 nanogram per milliliter (right leg) and 0.42 + 0.08 nanogram per milliliter (upper limb) while the experimental leg increased to 0.71 + 0.13 nanogram per milliliter (p less than 0.05 versus right leg, p less than 0.005 versus upper limb).

Some of the patients with tumors in the second part of the duodenum presented with clinically evident jaundice. The symptom complex of all other patients was compatible with many benign diseases and made the diagnosis difficult. At laparotomy, seven patients had resectable disease. Two patients had advanced disease so that no curative resection could be done. In one patient, a resection was technically impossible. A modified Whipple procedure (in which the pylorus is saved) is the method of choice for tumors of the second part of the duodenum. We perform a segmental resection for other tumors. In five patients, there was no involvement of the lymph nodes and these patients are well--two more than 30 months postoperatively and one patient almost ten years postoperatively. In two patients, one or more lymph nodes were involved, but they are still well 30 months postoperatively. As the prognosis of carcinoma of the duodenum, once metastasized, is poor, a greater awareness of the possibility of a duodenal tumor must accompany aggressive diagnostic and surgical procedures. That will be the only way to a higher percentage of cures.\r"

In order to study more fully the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the ependymoma, we identified 62 patients with histologically proven neoplasms. Twenty-two were supratentorial, 21 were infratentorial, and 19 were intramedullary spinal cord tumors. These groups had mean ages of 17, 7, and 41 years, respectively, at the time of first symptoms. The presenting and accompanying symptoms were related to location and included headaches, nausea, visual changes, hemiparesis, and neck, back, and radicular pain. Neurological signs included papilledema, nystagmus, gait disturbance, cranial nerve palsies, altered mental status, paraparesis, and sensory dysfunction. Radiologic modalities of particular importance included computed tomography and myelography. Surgery and radiation therapy were the primary treatment modalities with median survival times from first symptoms being 92, 36, and 117 months for the above groups, respectively. Based on computer-generated survival curves, several characteristics significantly affected survival. These included tumor site, age, and neuraxis metastases. In patients with supratentorial tumors, cranial nerve palsies, microcystic changes, and mitotic figures were important, while in patients with infratentorial tumors, widened sutures, increased head circumference, age, epithelial features, and subependymal features significantly affected survival. Patients who had complete gross resection of a spinal cord tumor had no recurrences or mortality.\r"

All control animals showed spontaneous recovery of spinal cord function as measured by SERs. Treatment with a moderate intravenous dose of nimodipine resulted in a 32% drop in systemic blood pressure and delay in or failure of spinal cord recovery. We concluded that in this model, nimodipine treatment had deleterious effect on the spinal cord recovery due to the significant associated hypotension. It is likely that marked hypotension in the case of traumatic loss of autoregulation overrides the expected nimodipine-related increase in spinal cord blood flow with resultant additional ischemic damage.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of fluid resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock on cerebral edema, intracranial pressure (ICP), and blood brain barrier function was investigated in the presence of a simulated head injury. Beagle dogs were anesthetized and ICP was measured via a right subarachnoid bolt while a contralateral epidural balloon was inflated in the left hemicranium to mimic a closed head injury. Forty percent of the dogs' blood was shed and the shock state was maintained for 1 hour. Resuscitation was initiated with shed blood and a volume of either normal saline solution (NS, n = 5), 10% dextran-40 (D-40, n = 6), or hypertonic (3%) saline solution (HS, n = 6) equal to the amount of shed blood. Evans blue solution was infused intravenously, and intravascular volume was then maintained with normal saline solution. Control (n = 5) dogs did not undergo shock, but received equivalent volumes of normal saline solution and Evans blue solution. The dogs were killed after 2 hours of resuscitation, and the brains were removed, weighed, and fixed in formalin. The average intracranial pressure value after epidural balloon inflation was 18.6 +/- 0.80 mm Hg and decreased equally in all groups during the shock period, averaging 10.8 +/- 1.24 mm Hg at the end of the shock period. Fluid resuscitation markedly elevated ICP in the NS and D-40 groups, reaching maximal values of 46.6 +/- 12.11 mm Hg and 45.3 +/- 28.95 mm Hg, respectively. Maximal ICP values in control and HS groups measured 21.8 +/- 1.36 mm Hg and 15.8 +/- 2.04 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.25 for HS versus NS control). Wet brain weights were significantly less in the HS group compared with either NS or D-40 groups (p less than 0.05). Coronal sections of fixed HS brains showed deep cortical Evans blue staining on the side of balloon injury. Therefore, in the presence of an intracranial mass lesion, resuscitation with hypertonic (3%) saline solution is accompanied by lower ICP values and less cerebral edema than is isotonic saline or colloid resuscitation. Blood brain barrier function is not restored by hypertonic saline solution resuscitation.\r"

We report our experience with side-to-side CDS in 116 patients with benign (65 patients) and malignant (46 patients) biliary diseases. Even though the mean age of our patients with benign disease--patients who underwent urgent operations because of obstructive jaundice (74%), liver damage (approximately 60%), and other biliary complications--was 66.8 years, the perioperative mortality was 3.07% and the long-term follow-up results were excellent with no biliary complications. In regard to the controversy about the use of CDS in malignant biliary obstructions, our experience shows that none of the 42 patients had any complication due to malignant invasion of the stoma, and only one patient had ascending cholangitis; the perioperative mortality in this group was 8.6%. In our opinion, CDS is a relatively safe, definitive procedure for treatment of benign and malignant biliary diseases, with good long-term results in high-risk, aged patients.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid and parathyroid surgery is usually performed with the patient under general anesthesia; however, for selected patients regional anesthesia may be preferable. Between September 1977 and March 1986 regional anesthesia was used successfully as the sole anesthetic technique in 17 patients who underwent thyroid surgery and two patients who underwent parathyroid surgery. Procedures included two total thyroidectomies, 14 lobectomies or lobectomies with isthmusectomies, and one isthmusectomy. These 17 operations represent approximately 5% of the thyroid operations performed by the senior surgeon over the corresponding time. One patient underwent combined completion thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy, and another patient underwent successful parathyroidectomy under regional anesthesia. In two additional patients, procedures could not be completed under regional anesthesia alone. In one of these two patients regional anesthesia appeared to effect a transient recurrent nerve paralysis. The indications for use of regional anesthesia have been primarily patient preference and associated cardiac or pulmonary disease. We now consider as contraindications to regional anesthesia patient apprehension about the technique, deafness, high spinal cord injury, recurrent laryngeal or phrenic nerve palsy, and allergy to local anesthesia. During this period, from 1977 to 1986, our administration of regional anesthesia has evolved from bilateral deep and superficial cervical plexus blocks to bilateral superficial blocks alone using bupivacaine with epinephrine, 1:200,000.\r"

Data were compared with data from 10 nonseptic, postsurgical patients. At the time of the initial measurement, an adequate hyperemic response could be produced in all patients. In the further course of the disease, in nine of the 12 patients severe multiple organ failure developed. In spite of sufficient values for arterial blood pressure, oxygenation, and the clotting system, RH was absent in these patients (8 +/- 2 days after the initial measurement). Subsequently, seven of these nine patients died (4 +/- 2 days after the onset of microvascular nonreactivity). Until death, RH was absent in each patient, and at this time therapy-resistant hypoxemia, hypotension, and severe disturbances of the clotting system were present. In the two surviving patients RH was restored completely. These results indicate that (1) the septic state per se is not necessarily combined with impaired microvascular reactivity (rather, the absence of RH may be a sign of generally poor clinical conditions); (2) the absence of RH is not related to therapy-resistant hypotension, hypoxia, and severe clotting disorders but precedes these changes; and (3) provocation of RH may be of clinical use for early detection of microcirculatory malfunction in high-risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "Since implantation of small-caliber vascular grafts with preformed confluent endothelial cell monolayers (ECMs) may prevent acute platelet deposition and thrombus formation, we have evaluated the conditions necessary to produce durable ECMs. Cultured human umbilical-vein ECs in buffer were attached to vascular grafts--either expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) or knitted Dacron, both with inside diameters of 4 mm--precoated with collaten type I and perfused in vitro with serum-containing culture medium to achieve cell spreading into confluent monolayers. The number of cells attached was quantified by DNA measurements and indium-111 labeling. Morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. The maximum number of cells that attached acutely was 3.6 X 10(5) cells/cm2 graft, and the minimum number needed for confluence was 1.4 X 10(5) cells/cm2 graft. Confluence was morphologically complete after 2 hours of in vitro perfusion at 15 ml/min. When ECMs were exposed to varying flow rates, cell retention after 1 hour was 96.1% +/- 5.6% at 50 ml/min, 94.6% +/- 6.1% at 100 ml/min, 77.6% +/- 10.8% at 200 ml/min (p less than 0.001), and 40.1% +/- 10.4% at 400 ml/min (p less than 0.0001). Confluence was maintained for all grafts exposed to flows of 100 ml/min or less. Fewer cells were retained when acutely attached, unspread cells (71.5% +/- 11.5%) were compared with established ECMs (89.9% +/- 6.7%) at a flow rate of 100 ml/min (p less than 0.0001). ECMs on knitted Dacron were more durable than on ePTFE (82.7% +/- 5.3% versus 75.5% +/- 4.8% remained attached at 200 ml/min, P less than 0.05). 111Indium-labeled and unlabeled cells were equivalent with respect to saturation level attachment, spreading time to confluence, and durability under flow at 100 ml/min. We conclude that confluent and durable endothelial cell monolayers can be established on small-caliber vascular grafts within 2 hours.\r"

During surgery the following viscera positions were detected: the gallbladder was located to the left of the round ligament, the choledochus was in front of the first portion of the duodenum, the small intestine was in the left portion of the abdomen, and the colon was exclusively at the right side of the abdomen. This reversed rotation is a rare condition, only occasionally reported in the literature. However, the simultaneous association with anomalies in the gallbladder position (in the left lobe) and the biliary tract (the choledochus located in front of the duodenum) makes this a case unlike any other described in the medical literature.\r"

One hundred and eighty one asthmatic women were monitored during 198 pregnancies. Antiasthmatic treatment consisted of inhaled beta 2 adrenergic drugs, beclomethasone, sodium cromoglycate, oral theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids as needed. Postpartum information on asthmatic symptoms and infant feeding was collected by means of a questionnaire. A control group of 198 non-asthmatic pregnant women was matched for age and parity. Atopic women had less severe asthma than non-atopic women. During pregnancy 40% of the patients were managed with the same antiasthmatic medication as before pregnancy; 18% needed less and 42% more medication. Pre-eclampsia occurred more often in asthmatic than control subjects, especially in patients with severe asthma. Hypoglycaemia occurred more often in infants of mothers with severe asthma than in infants of mothers with less severe disease. Theophylline medication at term did not influence labour or delivery. Asthma caused no emergencies during labour. Among the asthmatic subjects 28% of babies were delivered by caesarean section compared with 17% in the control group. There was no difference between asthmatic and control subjects with regard to length of gestation, birth weight, incidence of perinatal deaths, low Apgar scores, neonatal respiratory difficulties, hyperbilirubinaemia, or malformations. It is concluded that severe asthma or systemic corticosteroid treatment (or both) during pregnancy seems to increase the incidence of mild pre-eclampsia in the mother and hypoglycaemia in the infant. The findings suggest that careful supervision of asthma during pregnancy and labour by obstetricians and chest physicians working in close collaboration should prevent most of the serious obstetric and neonatal complications of asthma in pregnancy reported by previous authors.\r"

Alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from 32 patients with proved collagen vascular disease but no evidence of lung disease were compared with those from 10 patients with collagen vascular disease with interstitial lung disease (CVD-ILD) and from 10 healthy controls. The total number of alveolar macrophages did not differ between patients with collagen vascular disease and controls but were substantially increased in the CVD-ILD group. Alveolar macrophages from 31 of the 32 patients with collagen vascular disease and from all 10 in the CVD-ILD group had at least one criterion of activation. Neutrophil chemotactic activity was detected in supernatants from alveolar macrophage culture in 23 of the 32 patients with collagen vascular disease and from nine of the 10 in the CVD-ILD group; fibronectin secretion by alveolar macrophages was increased in 12 of the 32 patients with collagen vascular disease and in nine of the 10 in the CVD-ILD group. Furthermore, alveolar macrophages from 20 of the 32 patients with collagen vascular disease and four of the 10 CVD-ILD patients spontaneously released increased amounts of superoxide anion.

To determine whether FMLP causes bronchoconstriction in man in vivo, a preliminary study was undertaken in which five non-smokers (mean age 35 years, FEV1 94% (SEM 5%) predicted) and five smokers (mean age 34 years, FEV1 93% (6%) predicted) inhaled aerosols of FMLP. None of the subjects showed airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine (the provocative concentrations of histamine causing a fall of greater than or equal to 20% in FEV1 (PC20) were over 8 mg/ml). FMLP dissolved in 50% dimethylsulphoxide and 50% saline in concentrations of 0, 0.06, 0.12, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/ml was administered to the subjects by means of a French-Rosenthal dosimeter, FEV1 being recorded after inhalation of each concentration. Dose dependent falls in FEV1 occurred in five non-smokers (geometric mean 1.76, 95% confidence limits 0.87-3.53 mg/ml) and three smokers (0.23, 0.07-0.78 mg/ml), with two smokers not responding by 20% to the highest concentration of FMLP. On a separate day the FMLP dose-response curves were repeated after nebulisation of 500 micrograms of ipratropium bromide. The PC20 FMLP in the responders more than doubled. In six additional normal subjects a histamine inhalation test was performed before and four and 24 hours after inhalation of FMLP. All subjects remained unresponsive to histamine. These results show that FMLP is a potent bronchoconstrictor in some non-asthmatic individuals in vivo and this may be important in bronchoconstriction related to infection in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.\r"

Patients performed two progressive treadmill exercise tests to a symptom limited maximum, with at least 30 minutes rest between tests. They received compressed air or supplemental oxygen from nasal prongs for 10 minutes before exercise in a double blind randomised trial with a crossover design. Heart rate and breathlessness score on a visual analogue scale were compared between tests at 75% of the maximum distance walked in the compressed air test. The mean arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) after oxygen (93%) was significantly higher than after compressed air (91%). There was no significant change, however, in maximum distance walked or maximum heart rate, or in the breathlessness score or heart rate at 75% of maximum distance walked. The study had a power of 93% for detecting an increase of 50 metres in maximum distance walked. There was an order effect, with better performance on the second test; but the magnitude of the difference was small. It is concluded that administration of supplemental oxygen sufficient to raise SaO2 above 90% for 10 minutes before exercise is unlikely to improve maximum exercise performance or breathlessness on exertion in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.\r"

Use of both nebulised saline and nebulised terbutaline immediately before chest physiotherapy gave a significantly greater yield of sputum than did physiotherapy alone, and terbutaline also significantly increased radioaerosol clearance from the whole lung and from regions of interest. The mechanism is unclear, but this method may provide a simple way of increasing the efficacy of conventional chest physiotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet size, expressed as mean platelet volume, was estimated in 35 patients with chronic airflow obstruction and a wide range of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) values. In these patients there was a negative correlation between MPV and PaO2 (r = -0.70). Mean platelet volume was greater (9.41 (0.86) fl) in 20 patients with an arterial PaO2 of 8 kPa (60 mm Hg) or less than in 18 normal subjects (8.21 (0.63) fl; p less than 0.001). After 24 hours of supplemental oxygen treatment there was a small fall in mean platelet volume, from 9.47 (1.06) to 8.96 (0.8) fl (p less than 0.05) in 12 hypoxaemic patients (PaO2 breathing air less than or equal to 8 kPa) but no change in nine non-hypoxaemic patients. Larger platelets are considered to be haemostatically more active, leading to abnormal platelet function, which may contribute to the development of pulmonary vascular damage in chronic hypoxaemia. Supplemental oxygen may partially reverse these changes by modifying platelet size and activity.\r"

Twenty smokers were examined to determine the relationship between cigarette smoke inhalation patterns and bronchial reactivity. Inhalation patterns were measured non-invasively with a respiratory inductive plethysmograph and these were related to the provocative concentration of histamine that caused a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) and to the cough threshold for inhaled citric acid. Histamine PC20 values were inversely correlated with depth and rate of inhalation. Cough threshold was inversely correlated with greater cigarette consumption and with depth of inhalation.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate seasonal variation in non-specific bronchial reactivity in wheat workers, we carried out histamine inhalation tests in 29 workers (28 of them men) from a small farming community with symptoms of wheat associated asthma before, during and after the 1983-4 Australian wheat harvest season. Four were cigarette smokers, and the age range was 12-54 (mean (SD) 30 (10)) years. Twenty eight subjects were atopic (one positive skinprick test result in tests with 10 common antigens), 60% reacting to house dust mite and all to at least one of eight wheat antigens. Baseline spirometry gave normal results (mean FVC1 90% (SD 8%) predicted; FVC 91% (7%) predicted). Bronchial reactivity was tested by the method of Yan et al. The cumulative doses of histamine acid phosphate (up to 3.91 mumol) that caused a fall of 20% from baseline in FEV1 was determined (PD20) and expressed as the geometric mean. In the low exposure season, May 1983, nine subjects had a PD20 (mean 1.2, range 0.3-3.9 mumol). The number rose to 19 in the summer harvest season, December 1983 (mean 0.8, range 0.07-3.9 mumol) and returned to nine in the subsequent winter, July 1984 (mean 1.8, range 0.4-3.9 mumol). The change in the number of subjects with a PD20 was significant (p less than 0.01). Four additional subjects probably had increased bronchial reactivity in the harvest season: in two the post-saline FEV1 was too unstable to give them histamine challenge and in two the challenge was inadvertently discontinued prematurely. Baseline FEV1 and FVC fell by 8% between the first and second studies (p less than 0.001); values were intermediate in the third study (FEV1 3.74, 3.44, and 3.57; FVC 4.66, 4.28, and 4.41 litres respectively). Linear modelling analysis of log PD20, season, FEV1, FVC, age, seasonality of asthma symptoms and skin test data indicated that the harvest season was the only significant determinant of variation in log PD20. It is concluded that in these wheat workers there is a seasonal variation in bronchial reactivity that may reflect a response to allergens associated with grain.\r"

Fourteen normal subjects with apparently healthy lungs were studied. A technique was developed for rapid and automatic extraction of lung field data from the computed tomography scans. The Hounsfield unit histograms were constructed and, when normalised for predicted lung volumes, shown to be consistent in shape for all the subjects. A three dimensional presentation of the data in the form of a \"net plot\" was devised, and from this a logarithmic relationship between the area of each lung slice and its mean density was derived (r = 0.9, n = 545, p less than 0.0001). The residual density, calculated as the difference between measured density and density predicted from the relationship with area, was shown to be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 25 Hounsfield units (chi 2 test: p less than 0.05). A presentation combining this residual density with the net plot is described.\r"

A study was carried out to determine the predictive value of measurements made from the chest radiographs of 50 normal subjects and of 27 patients undergoing right heart catheterisation for cardiac or pulmonary vascular disease, taking account of radiographic magnification. After such corrections a right descending pulmonary artery diameter over 16.7 mm or a left descending pulmonary artery diameter of over 16.9 mm distinguished 12 of 23 pulmonary hypertensive subjects, with no false positive results. The diameter was then arbitrarily squared (any differences between patients and control subjects being exaggerated) and the product was divided by either predicted or actual lung volume in an attempt to correct for body size. The new index distinguished 19 of 23 patients with pulmonary hypertension, with one false positive, when the divisor was actual lung volume; when predicted lung volume was used 18 of 23 patients were distinguished, again with one false positive result.\r"

In three patients the primary diagnosis was cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and in one sarcoidosis. We confirmed the presence of large multilamellar aggregates of lipoprotein by ultrastructural examination in patients with both interstitial lung disease and idiopathic alveolar lipoproteinosis. The small lamellar bodies and amorphous debris found in idiopathic alveolar lipoproteinosis were rare in the patients with interstitial lung disease. The lavage fluid from patient with interstitial lung disease did not show the substantial alterations in phospholipid composition that were seen in lavage fluid in idiopathic alveolar lipoproteinosis. These ultrastructural and biochemical features may help to distinguish idiopathic from other causes of alveolar lipoproteinosis, particularly at an early stage, when differential diagnosis may be difficult.\r"

Of the 206 patients with focal disease in whom the final diagnosis was a malignancy, 161 (78%) had a correct biopsy diagnosis. Of the 78 patients in whom the final diagnosis was non-malignant disease, 60 (77%) had a correct biopsy diagnosis. In diffuse pulmonary disease the histological diagnosis was correct in 75 of 98 patients (77%). In focal benign disease and in diffuse disease the reliability of the diagnosis increased with the specificity of the diagnosis. Where the biopsy diagnosis was not in accordance with the final diagnosis, histological examination usually showed normal lung tissue (with or without non-specific inflammation), necrotic tissue, or no tissue at all. Two patients died from the procedure. Minor complications occurred in 18%. It is concluded that the usefulness of Tru-cut biopsy is not confined to malignant focal disease; it is also reliable in benign focal disease and diffuse pulmonary disease when a specific diagnosis is obtained.\r"

As dietary enrichment with fish oil lipids can suppress leucocyte function, the effect of these lipids on asthma control and neutrophil function was studied in 20 subjects with mild asthma. Twelve subjects received capsules containing 3.2 g of eicosapentaenoic acid and 2.2 g of docosahexaenoic acid daily and eight subjects received placebo capsules containing olive oil for 10 weeks in a double blind fashion. Baseline specific airways conductance, airways responsiveness to histamine and exercise, diurnal peak expiratory flow, symptom scores, and bronchodilator use were measured. Neutrophil fatty acid composition was evaluated by gas chromatography, calcium ionophore induced neutrophil leukotriene (LT)B4 and LTB5 generation were measured by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay, and neutrophil chemotactic responses to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) and LTB4 were assessed by a microchemotaxis technique. Although the fish oil supplemented diet produced a greater than 10 fold increase in the eicosapentaenoic acid content of neutrophil phospholipids, there was no significant change in airways responsiveness to histamine or any change in any of the clinical measurements. After dietary supplementation with fish oil there was a 50% inhibition of total LTB (LTB4 + LTB5) generation by ionophore stimulated neutrophils and neutrophil chemotaxis was substantially suppressed. Neutrophil function remained unchanged in the placebo group. It is concluded that in subjects with mild asthma a fish oil enriched diet attenuates neutrophil function without changing the severity of asthma.\r"

There were no significant changes in symptom scores over the six weeks of either the control diet or the fish oil diet. PEF values, however, were significantly lower during the fifth and sixth week of the fish oil diet than during the control diet (308 v 262 l/min week 5 and 306 v 256 l/min week 6). Bronchodilator usage was also greater during the fifth and sixth week of the fish oil diet than during the control period (12.0 v 7.4 and 13.0 v 7.4 puffs a day in weeks 5 and 6).

These included an initial application of liquid nitrogen to mattresses and bedroom carpets to kill the live house dust mite population. Histamine airway responsiveness, symptom scores, peak expiratory flow rates (PEF), and house dust mite numbers were determined during the two week pretrial and eight week trial periods. Nine patients in each group completed the study. By the end of the study there was a significant reduction in live mites in the \"avoidance\" group but not in the control group. The avoidance group showed a significant improvement in symptom scores measured on a linear analogue scale, in the number of hours each day spent wheezing (mean reduced from 8.6 to 4.5 hours), and in PEF (l/min) both in the morning (from 364 to 388) and in the evening (from 368 to 392). These changes were not found in the control group. The provocative concentration (PC) of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20FEV1) had increased significantly in the avoidance group at eight weeks (from 0.58 to 2.3 mg/ml), whereas no change was seen in the control group (from 0.93 to 1.21 mg/ml). These results show that house dust mite avoidance, combined with initial killing of the mite by liquid nitrogen, diminishes airway responsiveness and improves asthma symptom control over an eight week period in adult asthmatic patients with house dust mite allergy.\r"

The earliest changes on magnetic resonance images were an absence of signal void in the basilar artery suggestive of severe reduction of blood flow or occlusion (flow-void phenomena). The presumed basilar artery thrombosis was best demonstrated as a linear structure isointense or hyperintense with the brainstem in the pontine cistern on T1-weighted parasagittal images and as either absence of flow-void phenomena or higher signal intensity at various levels corresponding to the course of the basilar artery on the axial T2-weighted images. Brainstem parenchymal changes characteristic of infarction were not obvious for at least 12 hours after onset or 90 minutes after latest progression of symptoms and were best shown by both axial and coronal T2-weighted images. Recognition of these magnetic resonance imaging findings may allow earlier diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemia in the vertebrobasilar system.\r"

Fifteen of 20 patients with acute symptoms (mean treatment-onset interval 7.6 hours) demonstrated complete recanalization; 10 of the 15 patients exhibited clinical improvement of varying degree by the time of hospital discharge. Four of the 20 patients suffered hemorrhagic transformation of the infarcted territory without clinical deterioration or demise. Because of the study format and the limited number of patients, dose responses for recanalization and risk relations were not established.

These agents are widely used in neurosurgical practice for the treatment of systemic hypertension. Patients were assigned to two groups on the basis of their mean intracranial pressure. Group I comprised 20 patients with a mean intracranial pressure of 20-40 mm Hg (moderately increased ICP group), and Group II consisted of 18 patients with a mean intracranial pressure of greater than 40 mm Hg (severely increased ICP group). Nifedipine, chlorpromazine, and reserpine reduced mean arterial blood pressure by 18-20% in both groups (p less than 0.05 in each). In Group I these agents raised mean intracranial pressure by 10-35% and decreased cerebral perfusion pressure by 20-32% (p less than 0.05 for both), but in Group II these changes were more marked: mean intracranial pressure increased 38-64% and cerebral perfusion pressure decreased 40-54% (p less than 0.01 for both). Furosemide did not significantly reduce mean arterial blood pressure but slightly reduced mean intracranial pressure in each group. Thiopental reduced both mean arterial blood pressure and intracranial pressure in both groups. The effect on intracranial pressure was pronounced in Group II, in which mean arterial blood pressure fell by 18% (p less than 0.05) and mean intracranial pressure decreased 50% (p less than 0.01), whereas in Group I mean arterial blood pressure was reduced by 16% and mean intracranial pressure dropped 23% (p less than 0.05 in each).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Regional cerebral blood flow maps were then computed and assessed. All patients were categorized as being of good recovery potential, with moderate-sized hematomas, and all were treated conservatively. The regional cerebral blood flow assessments were scheduled within 4 days after, 2 weeks after, and less than 25 days after the ictus. The initial decrease in hemispheric blood flow ipsilateral to the side of the hematoma was calculated as the ratio of ipsilateral to contralateral hemispheric blood flow and was correlated with the size of the hematoma; that is, the larger the hematoma, the greater the decrease in the ratio of ipsilateral to contralateral hemispheric blood flow. The decrease persisted for 1 month. The mean of the ratio at 2 weeks after onset was 70%, the lowest during follow-up. All cases examined within 4 days after onset demonstrated perihematomatous focal hyperemia, or \"luxury perfusion,\" which accounted for the delayed decrease. The same tissue that had previously shown hyperemia showed decreased regional cerebral blood flow 2 weeks after onset. Our results demonstrate that the luxury perfusion syndrome caused the secondary brain damage even in the cases that were in relatively good condition. The feasibility of treatment can be assessed by considering these results.\r"

This decline is greater than that of the general causes of mortality, which was on the order of 20%. It parallels the decline in congestive heart failure mortality but differs from that of ischemic heart disease. Nevertheless, despite the increase in the proportion of elderly people in the population, the total number of deaths from cerebrovascular diseases has remained almost unchanged, although the deaths occur at a higher age than previously. If this trend is confirmed, cerebrovascular diseases will remain one of the more frequent causes of death in the elderly and thus a social problem of crucial importance.\r"

Immediately after a 5-minute episode of near-total tourniquet-induced brain ischemia, cortical blood flow returned to normal or above normal. Thereafter, cortical blood flow fell progressively to a level 71.7% below normal by 3 hours after ischemia. In contrast, in cats that received 1 mg/kg i.v. U74006F 15 minutes after the ischemic episode, cortical blood flow remained significantly greater than that seen in vehicle-treated cats. At 3 hours, cortical blood flow had declined by only 45.7% (p less than 0.04 compared with vehicle). In addition, U74006F treatment significantly improved postischemic maintenance of blood pressure and recovery of somatosensory evoked potentials and reduced postischemic arterial blood acidosis. U74006F had no effect on cortical blood flow, somatosensory evoked potentials, or blood pressure in nonischemic cats. Our results suggest that U74006F may be useful in the early treatment of global cerebral ischemia.\r"

The aim of our study was to evaluate whether transesophageal echocardiography is superior in detecting mitral valve prolapse and other cardiac abnormalities compared with transthoracic echocardiography in an age-matched control group and in young patients with cerebral ischemic events (patient group). Forty patients with cerebral ischemic events (mean age 35.2 years) and 29 controls (mean age 30.4 years) were examined using both methods. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed a significantly higher incidence of mitral valve prolapse in the patient group compared with the control group (p less than 0.001). By means of transesophageal echocardiography, it was possible to measure highly significant bulging in both the anterior and the posterior mitral leaflet in the patient group compared with the control group (p less than 0.001), and the thickness of the mitral leaflets was significantly higher in the patient group. In 9 of 20 (45%) patients with normal transthoracic echocardiograms, transesophageal echocardiography showed pathologic findings. We found transesophageal echocardiography to be a sensitive method for detecting mitral valve prolapse as well as valve changes and other cardiac abnormalities not detectable by conventional echocardiography. Our study underlines the role of mitral valve prolapse in young stroke patients as a relevant risk factor and emphasizes the importance of changed mitral valve morphology.\r"

Such increases in free fatty acid, arachidonic acid, and prostaglandin concentrations suggest excessive production and accumulation of these substances in the ischemic brain. We used a rabbit model of ischemic infarction to examine the relation between controlled central nervous system ischemia and cerebrospinal fluid prostaglandin levels. We found that following stroke PGF2 alpha and not PGD2 was the predominant prostaglandin present in the cerebrospinal fluid. PGF2 alpha also underwent the largest percent increase over control prostaglandin concentrations. This is similar to human and dog cerebrospinal fluid studies, which demonstrate PGF2 alpha as the predominant prostaglandin following ischemic injury. The lack of PGD2 elevation under ischemic conditions may suggest that the rabbit model is more like stroke in humans than the rat or gerbil models. Our preliminary work demonstrates that it is practical to study postischemic prostaglandin changes in cerebrospinal fluid rather than in brain tissue in a rabbit model of central nervous system ischemia.\r"

The mean and the pulse pressures were recorded simultaneously from within the aneurysm and within the common carotid artery, before and after 50% proximal carotid artery stenosis. These experiments were performed under systemic normotension, hypotension, and hypertension. Normal data suggest that mean intracarotid and intra-aneurysmal pressures are similar and relate in a nearly linear fashion to mean arterial pressure. However, after 50% stenosis, the data had a cubic relationship, the reduction of pressure occurring only in the middle range of mean arterial pressure. Both intra-aneurysmal and intracarotid pulse pressures displayed less dependence on mean arterial pressure. However, sigmoid curves also were observed with the pulse pressures after 50% proximal common carotid artery stenosis. In all cases, after 50% stenosis, the rate of increase of the pulse pressures with mean arterial pressure was greater for higher mean arterial pressures. Our preliminary data indicate that a detailed study of intra-aneurysmal pressure and blood flow in relation to systemic variables such as mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance may not only suggest improved means of managing patients with intracranial aneurysms, but also may raise the possibility that, under certain conditions, higher intra-aneurysmal pressures may be induced by downstream stenosis.\r"

The rats inhaled a gas mixture of 5% oxygen and 95% nitrogen for 3.5 minutes to induce hypoxia, followed by room air. Under these conditions, mean PaO2 was decreased from 85 to 22 mm Hg 3 minutes after the start of the inhalation concomitant with a decrease in blood pressure from 108 to 55 mm Hg. There were no significant differences in these variables between rats used for vestibular nucleus experiments and rats used for trigeminal nucleus experiments. In the lateral vestibular nucleus, hypoxia inhibited postsynaptic components of the evoked field potential, spike generation of monosynaptic neurons on vestibular nerve stimulation, and firing induced by iontophoretic application of glutamate. In the spinal trigeminal nucleus, however, there were no alterations of the field potential or spike generation of the neurons on trigeminal nerve stimulation. These results indicate that the lateral vestibular nucleus neurons are much more sensitive to hypoxia than the spinal trigeminal nucleus neurons. The failure of transmission in the monosynaptic neurons of the lateral vestibular nucleus is suggested to be due to the inhibition of excitability of the postsynaptic membrane.\r"

The dogs survived for greater than 1 week while exhibiting such clinical symptoms as disturbance of consciousness, tetraparesis, oculomotor paralysis, respiratory abnormalities, bradycardia, and arrhythmia.

In contrast, leukotriene C4 levels increased 2 hours after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion and peaked 30 minutes after reperfusion, with higher levels persisting until 60 minutes after reperfusion. Cerebral ischemia was accompanied by cerebral edema early after reperfusion. The edema correlated with increased leukotriene C4 levels. That the increased brain water content was causally related to an increase in leukotriene C4 was supported by results obtained following administration of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors ONO-LP-016 and AA-861. Both inhibitors suppressed the increased leukotriene C4 and brain water contents after reperfusion. Our results indicate that leukotriene C4 is closely associated with an induction of ischemic cerebral edema.\r"

  ".W": "Intracellular and extracellular acidosis may determine the ultimate outcome for brain tissue in cerebral ischemia. An extracellular acidosis that occurs in the penumbra zone was investigated in vitro as to its role in the formation of cytotoxic cell swelling. For that purpose, C6 glioma cells or primary cultured astrocytes were suspended in normal isotonic medium in normoxia during acidification to a final pH of 6.2. The cell volume response was determined by flow cytometry using hydrodynamic focusing, which allows one to recognize changes in cell size of less than 1%. A threshold pH of 6.8 was found that had to be crossed to induce cell swelling by acidosis. Once pH fell below this threshold, the increase in cell size appeared to be an all-or-nothing phenomenon. The cells rapidly assumed a final cell size of 115% of normal in the case of C6 glioma or of 118% in the case of primary cultured astrocytes independent of the actual level of acidosis or the duration of exposure. Acidosis-induced glial swelling could be significantly attenuated by 1) addition of amiloride, 2) administration of acetazolamide, or 3) replacement of bicarbonate buffer against N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES). Replacement of extracellular Na+ by choline chloride led to complete prevention of the acidosis-induced cell swelling. Taken together, the findings strongly indicate a central involvement of Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO3- exchange mechanisms in the development of cell swelling under these conditions. Activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter can be considered an attempt to maintain a normal intracellular pH at the expense of an abnormal cell volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Animal transfusion models were established to assess treatment programs for preventing or reversing platelet alloimmunization. Five control baboons given weekly transfusions of radiolabeled platelets from a single unrelated donor became immunized after an average of 2.4 +/- 2.1 transfusions. Similarly, 18 of 21 (86%) dogs given up to eight platelet transfusions from a single unrelated donor became immunized after an average of 2.3 +/- 1.7 transfusions. In six of seven baboons, prednisone or antithymocyte globulin alone or in combination effectively delayed platelet alloimmunization. In contrast, only two of 12 (17%) dogs given prednisone or antithymocyte serum (ATS) resisted alloimmunization. Neither splenectomy nor cyclophosphamide prevented alloimmunization in the baboon. In addition, attempts to reduce the immunogenicity of transfused platelets by inactivating the contaminating leukocytes with gamma radiation or by giving leukocyte-poor platelets were of no benefit in dogs. Reversal of platelet alloimmunization was achieved in two of three dogs treated with ATS and procarbazine hydrochloride. However, neither splenectomy, cyclophosphamide, ATS plus prednisone, nor vincristine sulfate produced any improvement. These studies show that the highly immunogenic nature of platelet transfusions in animals makes feasible the study of the prevention and reversal of platelet alloimmunization.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of platelet membrane glycoproteins during blood bank storage have reported conflicting results. This study assessed two major plasma membrane glycoproteins (GP Ib and GP IIb), an alpha-granule membrane protein (GMP-140), and the concentration of platelet membrane microparticles in cell-free plasma during routine hospital blood bank platelet storage. 125I-monoclonal antibody binding was used to measure membrane glycoproteins on the surface of intact platelets and to measure the concentration of membrane microparticles in cell-free plasma. Platelet concentrates were stored at room temperature in polyolefin bags for 7 days. In this blood bank, two types of rotators are routinely used for platelet concentrate storage: a 2-rpm circular tumbler rotator and a 6-rpm elliptical rotator. Different results were obtained with the rotators. With the tumbler rotator, there was no loss of platelets and antibody binding to GP Ib remained normal. With the elliptical rotator, one third of platelets were lost into clumps during storage, and a 50 percent decrease of antibody binding to GP Ib occurred in the remaining single platelets. There was no loss of antibody binding to GP IIb with either rotator. Antibody binding to GMP-140 increased equally in both rotators indicating that the remaining single platelets had secreted about 16 percent of their alpha-granule contents. The plasma concentration of platelet membrane microparticles was greater in the bags stored in the elliptical rotator. These results indicate that it is possible to maintain the normal concentration of platelet membrane glycoproteins Ib and IIb during 7 days of room-temperature blood bank storage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This chloroquine elution technique is relatively easy to perform and is effective in the removal of alloantibodies from the platelet surface. Eluted alloantibody was immunologically active once the chloroquine was removed from the eluate. The major advantage of this technique is that serologic testing of platelets after elution is possible, as 50 percent of the platelets remain after exposure to hypertonic acid chloroquine solution. Antigens on the platelet surface maintained their antigenicity subsequent to treatment, although measurable reductions in PIA1 reactivity occur. The elution technique was also successful in removing IgG from the platelet surface in patients with diseases involving elevated levels of platelet-associated IgG.\r"

  ".W": "Large numbers of mononuclear cells (MNC) are needed for hematologic reconstitution using peripheral blood stem cells. The possibility of isolating those cells by discontinuous Ficoll-diatrizoate density gradient centrifugation in two blood cell processors (the Haemonetics V50 [V50] and the Cobe 2991 [2991]) were examined. Buffy coats from peripheral blood containing 6.23 X 10(8) MNC were separated in the V50, resulting in a recovery of 75 percent. The purity of the cells, defined as the percentage of lymphocytes and monocytes among all leukocytes, was 95 percent. With larger cell loads (3 to 7 X 10(9) MNC), the yield was higher in the V50 than in the Cobe 2991 (92 versus 75%). After separation in the V50 or the 2991, the cloning efficiencies of hematopoietic progenitor cells (CFU-GM and BFUe) were not different from those of cells isolated on 5 ml Ficoll-diatrizoate gradients in centrifuge tubes. Both leukapheresis and MNC separation can be carried out with the same bowl and tubing set in the V50. With that approach, an average of 6 X 10(9) MNC were processed in 16 experiments. An average recovery of 82 percent with 95 percent purity was achieved. The authors conclude that, in terms of simplicity of operation, cost effectiveness, and maintenance of sterility, the V50 may be better suited than the 2991 for the purification of MNC from peripheral blood.\r"

Between 0.6 and 4.3 X 10(9) cells in autologous plasma were frozen in polyethylene freezing bags in a final volume of 50 ml. The recovery after thawing averaged 89 +/- 14 percent with a mean viability by trypan blue dye exclusion of 80 +/- 7 percent (n = 11). In aliquots of fresh and frozen-thawed PBL from the same subjects radiolabeled with 111In, the radiolabeling efficiency for both fresh and thawed cells was 49 +/- 15 percent (p = 0.98, n = 5). The mitogen mean stimulation indices for glycerol-frozen cells (471 with phytohemagglutinin-M, 176 with pokeweed mitogen, and 380 with concanavalin A) were superior to those of cells frozen by a standard technique with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (141, 47, and 123; p less than 0.05) and comparable to those of fresh PBL (403, 75, and 147). In a mixed lymphocyte culture, glycerol-frozen PBL showed significantly greater responsiveness to a pool of stimulator cells than did PBL frozen in DMSO (p = 0.03). Thawed cells are viable and functional as demonstrated by their response to mitogens and their ability to stimulate and respond in mixed lymphocyte culture.\r"

Because ascorbic acid and ascorbate-2-phosphate (A-2-P) are effective in maintaining erythrocyte 2,3 DPG during liquid preservation, ascorbate was stabilized through autoclaving and subsequent storage by adding it as the trisodium salt of A-2-P to a phosphate-adenine-saline solution at a pH of 8.5 to 9.0. Red cell concentrates prepared from blood drawn into citrate-phosphate-double-dextrose were supplemented with the A-2-P additive solution (AS-4) and studied in vitro and in vivo. Mean 2,3 DPG values for 22 units were 147.6, 113.5, and 82.3 percent of initial value after storage for 3, 4, and 5 weeks, respectively. Maintenance of 2,3 DPG was at the expense of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which fell to as low as 22.2 percent of initial value after 5 weeks. Despite the low ATP values, the 24 hour 51Cr-labeled red cell recoveries averaged 80.8 and 74.1 percent after 4 and 5 weeks of storage, respectively. The AS-4 system provides a red cell product with acceptable viability and improved oxygen off-loading function.\r"

Twenty-nine percent of clinically significant and 72 percent of clinically insignificant antibodies were not detected on at least one follow-up screening. Anti-Jka and anti-C were lost in 59 and 45 percent of cases, respectively. No significant differences in overall antibody loss were found according to sex, diagnosis, or the presence of multiple antibodies. Patients under 20 years of age may be more likely to lose significant antibodies. Pretransfusion review of previous records is vital for the prevention of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, because of the high number of clinically significant antibodies that are undetected in subsequent routine screening.\r"

For this purpose, a cooperative multidisciplinary group was formed, key indicators were identified, and an organization was set up. Data collected by this organization in the 1-year period needed for implementation of the program indicated that blood misuse was common practice. In fact, overrequest, overtransfusion, excessive reconstitution of whole blood (i.e., concurrent transfusion of red cells and fresh-frozen plasma), and underuse of predeposit were found in all ten surgical departments of the hospital. In a pilot study, data were collected from one surgical department during and after the implementation phase of the QA program; comparison of these data showed a postimplementation reduction of about two thirds in overtransfusion, whereas overrequest, reconstitution of whole blood, and predeposit rates remained unchanged. These results prompted continuation of the program in order to reach a definitive evaluation of its effectiveness.\r"

This study was conducted to determine red cell tolerance of rapid mixture with heated saline, which exposes red cells to heat only until thermal equilibration, which is a matter of seconds. Half-units of 35-day-old red cells stored in CPDA-1 were mixed at 6 to 10 degrees C in the blood container with an equal weight of 60, 70, or 80 degrees C saline. This resulted in mean mixture temperatures of 30.9, 37.5, and 42.6 degrees C, respectively. Controls consisted of the same mixture, but with 6 to 10 degrees C saline. The red cells in the mixtures were assessed for osmotic fragility, and the supernatant was examined for plasma hemoglobin and potassium. Neither osmotic fragility curves nor supernatant hemoglobin or potassium changed significantly with saline temperatures of 60 or 70 degrees C. When 80 degrees C saline was used, osmotic fragility, supernatant hemoglobin, and potassium all increased significantly (p less than 0.01) over control values. Red cells tolerate rapid mixture with 70 degrees C saline without hemolysis or change in osmotic fragility.\r"

  ".W": "Although reactions to granulocyte transfusions in neonates are rarely reported, we observed a near-fatal pulmonary reaction, presumably due to white cell antibodies, in a neonate with Rh hemolytic disease. The hemolytic disease was being treated with exchange transfusions, and at 2 days after the infant's birth, bacterial sepsis was suspected and granulocyte transfusions were begun. The first granulocyte transfusion (Day 3) was uneventful. Five minutes after the beginning of the second granulocyte transfusion (Day 4), severe respiratory distress, hypotension, bradycardia, cyanosis, and acidosis suddenly occurred. The infant's serum obtained after the reaction contained granulocytotoxic and B-lymphocytotoxic antibodies that reacted with leukocytes from the second granulocyte donor. Antibodies could not be detected either in the initial infant serum or in maternal serum. However, an antileukocyte antibody was present in the serum of a parous woman donor. We used plasma from this woman to prepare reconstituted whole blood for the exchange transfusion that we performed immediately preceding the second granulocyte transfusion. Despite the sequence of events, an irrefutable cause-and-effect mechanism could not be established because the properties of the donor and neonatal antibodies were similar, but not identical. However, this catastrophic event emphasizes both the potential for adverse effects of granulocyte transfusions in neonates and the need for caution when transfusing blood from parous women.\r"

CMV antibody testing by latex agglutination revealed 33 of 58 HIV-1 infected hemophiliacs (57%) were antibody-positive compared with 54 of 54 HIV-1 infected asymptomatic non-hemophiliac homosexuals (100%) (p less than .001). Nine of 15 hemophiliacs (60%) with symptomatic HIV-1 infection were CMV antibody-positive. We also tested 22 HIV-1 antibody-negative hemophiliacs who had received non-heat treated factor concentrates. 14 of these 22 (64%) were CMV antibody-positive compared with 57% of HIV-1 antibody-positive hemophiliacs. We conclude 1) there is little correlation between transmission of HIV-1 and CMV by factor concentrates, 2) the presence of CMV antibody does not appear to be associated with clinical stage of HIV-1 infection in hemophiliacs, and 3) there may be a significant number of CMV antibody-negative hemophiliacs with HIV-1 infection at risk for primary infection and subsequent disease if CMV seronegative blood products are not provided for future transfusions.\r"

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had developed in 42 patients, while 8 patients had AIDS-related complex. Transmission by sexual intercourse was the usual reported mode of spread. The modes of transmission of HIV-2 are thought to be the same as those for HIV-1, but perinatal transmission and transmission by sharing of needles among intravenous drug abusers have not yet been reported. The virus has not been identified in blood donors in the United States or West Germany, but two HIV-2-infected blood donors were reported in France. Further epidemiologic studies are needed to define the spectrum of disease, modes of transmission, and risk of HIV-2 to the blood supply.\r"
