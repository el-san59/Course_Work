  ".W": "The objectives of this study were to determine prognostic factors for response to treatment, freedom-from-relapse (FFR) survival, and overall survival of 737 aggressive malignant lymphoma patients treated with the doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, methylprednisolone, methotrexate with leucovorin, ifosfamide, etoposide, asparaginase, and cytarabine (LNH-84) regimen; to construct a prognostic index with factors isolated by multivariate analyses; and to validate this prognostic index with another set of patients. Complete response (CR) was reached in 75% of LNH-84 patients, and 30% of them relapsed. With a median follow-up of 36 months, median FFR survival and median overall survival were not reached. Low serum albumin level, high tumoral mass, weight loss, bone marrow involvement, greater than or equal to 2 extranodal sites, and increased lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level were associated with a low response rate. Advanced stage, increased LDH level, and nonlarge-cell histologic subtypes (diffuse mixed, lymphoblastic, and small non-cleaved) were statistically associated with a high relapse rate and short FFR survival. Increased LDH level, low serum albumin level, tumoral mass larger than 10 cm, greater than or equal to 2 extranodal sites, advanced stage, and age older than 65 years were statistically associated with short overall survival. Four of these parameters, namely, LDH level, stage, number of extranodal sites, and tumoral mass, were put together to construct a prognostic index. This index partitioned LNH-84 patients into three subgroups of good, intermediate, and poor prognosis (P less than .00001): CR rates of 93%, 83%, and 61%; relapse rates of 12%, 25%, and 45%; 3-year FFR survival of 87%, 73%, and 53%, and 3-year survival of 88%, 71%, and 41%, respectively. This prognostic index was applied to a test set of patients: 155 patients treated on protocols of the Nebraska Lymphoma Study Group. Using this index, these patients had 3-year FFR survival of 70%, 40%, and 22% (P = .0002) and 3-year survival of 79%, 52%, and 31% (P = .005). In patients with aggressive lymphomas, this simple prognostic index could distinguish between patients requiring intensive treatment such as autologous bone marrow transplantation in first complete remission and those who could be treated with standard regimens.\r"

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using overall survival as of September 1989 as the end point. Four independent negative predictors of survival were identified: presence of B symptoms; more than two involved lymph node sites; more than one extranodal site (variables related to tumor burden), and age older than 60, a variable related to the patient's ability to tolerate treatment. Each variable contributed the same relative risk of dying and, accordingly, this simple predictive formula was developed empirically: (4-N) x 30 = the approximate percentage of chance of survival at 5 years. \"N\" is the number of predictive variables present. The same four predictors were also found to be significant by multivariate analysis when only those patients achieving a complete response were analyzed.\r"

  ".W": "In the initial series of 198 patients treated at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, a review of presenting chest radiographs available on 192 of these patients showed 49 patients with mediastinal masses greater than one third the greatest posteroanterior chest diameter. Five patients had stage IIB disease, and 44 had stage III or IV disease. Thirty-five (71%) patients achieved a complete remission with MOPP chemotherapy. Fourteen (40%) of the complete responders relapsed, but four of these achieved durable remissions in response to subsequent therapy. Thirty (61%) patients have died (14 induction failures, nine relapsed patients, seven complete responders in remission). Thus, with a median follow-up of 20 years (range, 15 to 23), the overall survival for the group is 39%, and the disease-free survival for the complete responders is 60%. A subset of 10 patients received mantle radiation therapy after maximal response to MOPP. One of these patients failed to achieve complete remission, but among the nine complete responders only one has relapsed. In contrast, 13 of 26 (50%) patients achieving a complete response to MOPP alone have relapsed (P2 = .0536). Although MOPP alone was not prospectively compared with MOPP plus radiation therapy in the treatment of advanced-stage massive mediastinal Hodgkin's disease in this series, the retrospective analysis shows a nearly significant difference in disease-free survival favoring combined modality treatment. The difference in tumor mortality between MOPP-treated (44%) and combined modality-treated patients (80%) was also nearly significant (P2 = .055). However, overall survival differences between patients treated with MOPP alone and those treated with combined modality therapy were not significantly different (P2 = 0.23) because of the mortality related to late complications of combined modality treatment.\r"

  ".U": "91108499\r", 
  ".W": "From 1975 to 1988, 50 patients with lymph node biopsy-documented diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) presented with bone marrow involvement. Twenty-four patients (48%) had large-cell lymphoma (LCL) in the bone marrow and were compared with 19 (38%) patients who had small cleaved-cell lymphoma (SCCL) in the marrow. Additionally, seven patients (14%) had mixed small- and large-cell lymphoma (ML) in the marrow. Patients who had LCL marrow involvement were younger (P less than .02) and more frequently had elevated lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (P less than .001), high tumor burden (P less than .01), and more sites of extranodal disease (P less than .05) than those with SCCL in the marrow. The complete response (CR) rate to multiagent chemotherapy was 16.7% in the LCL group and 89.4% in the SCCL group (P less than .001). One third of the patients with LCL in the marrow developed CNS involvement, compared with only one patient in the SCCL group (P = .06). Overall 5-year survival was 79% in patients with SCCL marrow involvement, compared with only 12% in patients with LCL in the marrow (P = .002). Despite a high CR rate, patients with marrow involved by SCCL were at a high continuous risk of relapse with only a 30% failure-free survival at 5 years. We conclude that bone marrow involvement with LCL predicts for extremely poor prognosis with low response rate and short survival. Patients with SCCL in the bone marrow have a high rate of CR and a high rate of 5-year survival; however, there is a high risk of late relapse, and only 15% are in a continuous remission at 8 years.\r"

Induction therapy compared vincristine, cytarabine, and dexamethasone (VADx) with daunorubicin, cytarabine, and thioguanine (DAT). The complete remission (CR) rate using DAT was superior (82% v 61%, P = .02). Postremission therapy consisted of either \"standard\" two-cycle therapy or a more intensive four-cycle regimen given for 2 years. Overall, there was no difference in outcome for patients randomized to either continuation regimen. The overall complete continuous remission rate (CCR) for the \"best\" induction/continuation therapy combination at 2 years was .50 (SE = .06), at 3 years was .35 (.04), and at 4 years was .34 (.05). Analysis of selected clinical and laboratory parameters demonstrated differences in induction responses favoring DAT induction but did not impact eventual disease-free survival. There were two subgroups of patients who responded better to four-cycle continuation therapy. These were patients with French-American-British (FAB) M1/M2 (2-year CCR was .20 v .44, P = .01) and patients older than 10 years at diagnosis (.32 v .62, P = .004).\r"

  ".U": "91108502\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of these studies was to determine whether chemotherapy interfered with the ability of peripheral blood monocytes from patients with osteosarcoma to respond to the liposome-encapsulated activating agent muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (L-MTP-PE). This was done in preparation of designing an adjuvant therapy protocol that includes L-MTP-PE combined with chemotherapy postoperatively for the treatment of primary osteosarcoma. The majority of patients who fail current adjuvant chemotherapy do so while on chemotherapy. Therefore, we believe it is important to combine L-MTP-PE with chemotherapy early in the treatment course rather than waiting until all chemotherapy cycles are completed. The tumoricidal properties of monocytes from patients with osteosarcoma could be activated by L-MTP-PE to levels equal to or greater than those expressed by normal control monocytes. No intrinsic monocyte defect could be demonstrated. Single-agent chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin (CPD), high-dose methotrexate (MTX), Cytoxan (CTX, cyclophosphamide; Bristol-Myers Co, Evansville, IN), or Adriamycin (ADR, doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) did not interfere with this activation process. There was even a suggestion of enhanced activation potential following the administration of ADR. However, when both ADR and CTX were administered together on the same day, profound suppression in monocyte activation was observed. This suppressed function returned to normal by 3 weeks postcombination therapy. We therefore conclude that L-MTP-PE can be combined with ADR, CPD, MTX, or CTX as single agents but recommend that ADR plus L-MTP-PE is the most effective combination. By contrast, we discourage the use of L-MTP-PE when ADR and CTX are given together.\r"

  ".W": "We have observed hepatopathy, associated with thrombocytopenia, in children receiving chemotherapy for Wilms' tumor. We have studied this hepatopathy-thrombocytopenia syndrome (HTS) in patients enrolled in the United Kingdom Childrens' Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) Wilms' tumor trials (UKW1 and UKW2). At the time of this study, 501 patients had completed therapy. Treatment flow sheets were examined for evidence of hepatopathy (hepatomegaly with abnormal liver function tests) and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 25 x 10(9)/L). No child who developed the syndrome had received irradiation. HTS was seen in five of 355 (1.4%) of patients treated with combination chemotherapy but in none of the 146 patients treated with vincristine alone. In each instance, the onset was less than 10 weeks after diagnosis. In two children, hepatopathy was severe with jaundice, ascites, transaminases greater than 1,000 IU/L, and prolongation of prothrombin time. On average, HTS lasted 12 days, and resolved with supportive treatment. After recovery, the children tolerated chemotherapy, mostly at reduced dosage, without recurrence. There was no evident long-term morbidity. Dactinomycin is the probable cause of this syndrome. We conclude that the HTS is a rare but important complication of dactinomycin-containing combination chemotherapy for Wilms' tumor. Children developing \"isolated\" thrombocytopenia following dactinomycin are \"at risk\" of developing the full-blown syndrome and should have their treatment modified accordingly.\r"

Forty-five patients had limited disease (LD) and 25 extensive disease (ED) with good prognostic features. The regimen consisted of cisplatin 50 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1 and etoposide 75 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 2, alternating weekly with ifosfamide 2 g/m2 IV day 8 and doxorubicin 25 mg/m2 IV day 8, for a total of 12 weeks. Dose modifications were made according to defined hematologic criteria. Responding patients with limited disease subsequently received mediastinal radiotherapy. Overall response to chemotherapy was 91% with a complete response (CR) rate of 50%. Forty-five patients with limited disease (LD) achieved an overall response rate of 91% with a CR rate of 51%, and 25 patients with extensive disease (ED) achieved an overall response rate of 92% with a CR rate of 48%. Median survival for the whole group was 54 weeks (LD, 58 weeks; ED, 42 weeks). Hematologic toxicity was predictable, without the wide fluctuations in WBC count seen in conventional 3-weekly regimens. In all, one quarter of treatment courses were delayed, most frequently because of leukopenia. Dose reductions were required in 63% of cases. The average delivered dose intensity was calculated and shown to be 73% of projected. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild with nausea and vomiting being the most common. This weekly schedule of chemotherapy has proved to be active and well tolerated and is currently being compared with conventional 3-weekly chemotherapy in a randomized study.\r"

All protocols opened and closed between June 1977 and July 1987. The objectives of the present study were (1) to compare the frequency of vascular complications among patients who received adjuvant therapy for breast cancer with patients on observation, and (2) to estimate the contribution of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy to the occurrence of venous and arterial thrombi. The frequency of thrombosis, both venous and arterial combined, was 5.4% among patients who received adjuvant therapy and was 1.6% among patients on observation (P = .0002). Premenopausal patients who received chemotherapy and tamoxifen had significantly more venous complications than those who received chemotherapy without tamoxifen (2.8% v 0.8%, P = .03). Postmenopausal patients who received tamoxifen and chemotherapy had significantly more venous thrombi than those who received tamoxifen alone (8.0% v 2.3%, P = .03) or those who were observed (8.0% v 0.4%, P less than .0001). Premenopausal patients who received tamoxifen and chemotherapy had a 1.6% frequency of arterial thrombosis, significantly more than patients who received chemotherapy alone (1.6% v 0.0%, P = .004). The frequency of arterial thrombosis among postmenopausal patients was not significantly correlated with adjuvant therapy. In conclusion, patients who received adjuvant therapy for breast cancer had a 5.4% frequency of thromboembolic complications, significantly more than those who were observed. The combination of chemotherapy and tamoxifen was associated with more venous and arterial thromboembolic complications than chemotherapy alone in premenopausal patients and with more venous thrombi than tamoxifen alone among postmenopausal patients.\r"

The intended treatment consisted of 16 courses of LEP or eight courses of HEP given at 3-weekly intervals. Reasons for stopping treatment early included progressive disease, stable disease without symptomatic improvement, or severe toxicity deemed intolerable by either the patient or physician. Toxicity was recorded at 3-weekly and response at 9-weekly intervals using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria of response and toxicity. Two hundred nine patients were eligible for analysis, 98% of whom have been followed for more than a year. One hundred four patients received LEP and 105 HEP. Significantly worse myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea and vomiting, and mucositis were seen in the high-dose arm (P less than or equal to .001). More patients in the LEP arm stopped treatment before the fourth course than in the HEP arm, and the commonest reason for stopping was progressive disease. A similar median number of courses was given in each arm. There was a significantly higher response in the HEP arm (HEP - complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] = 41%, LEP - CR + PR = 23%). Despite this, no statistically significant differences was seen in overall survival or progression-free interval. The median survival for HEP and LEP was 44 and 46 weeks, respectively.\r"

  ".U": "91108509\r", 
  ".W": "Malignant pleural effusions are a common and significant problem in patients with advanced malignancies. Pleurodesis with tetracycline or other sclerosing agents is the usual treatment for malignant pleural effusions. In contrast to this approach, intrapleural chemotherapy has the potential advantage of treating the underlying malignancy in addition to controlling the effusion. Intracavitary cisplatin-based chemotherapy, which is cytotoxic rather than sclerosing, has proven safe and effective via the intraperitoneal route in ovarian cancer and malignant mesothelioma. There has been little previous experience, however, with intrapleural cisplatin-based chemotherapy. As part of a planned series of trials in malignant mesothelioma, the Lung Cancer Study Group first evaluated intrapleural cisplatin and cytarabine in patients with malignant pleural effusions from a variety of solid tumors. From April 1986 to November 1987, 46 patients with cytologically proven, symptomatic, and previously untreated malignant pleural effusions were entered on study. A single dose of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 plus cytarabine 1,200 mg was instilled into the pleural space via a chest tube, which was then immediately removed. Patients were evaluated for toxicity and response at 24 hours; 1, 2, and 3 weeks; and then monthly. No recurrence of the effusion was considered a complete response (CR). Partial response (PR) was defined as a 75% or greater decrease in the amount of the effusion on serial chest radiographs. One patient experienced reversible grade 4 renal toxicity, four patients had grade 3 hematologic toxicity, and five patients had grade 3 cardiopulmonary toxicity. The overall response rate (CR plus PR) at 3 weeks was 49% (18 of 37 patients). The median length of response was 9 months for a CR and 5.1 months for a PR. The outcome of this trial was sufficiently encouraging that this regimen has been incorporated into subsequent trials for malignant pleural mesothelioma.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with localized prostate cancer may be treated with either surgery (radical prostatectomy) or radiotherapy. Although controversial, many physicians believe that surgery offers a higher survival rate. However, the surgical treatment may also produce a higher rate of sexual impotency. Our study assessed how men value survival and sexual potency when asked to trade off one for the other. Using the treatment-choice technique, we interviewed 50 men aged 45 to 70 years without known prostate cancer. At hypothetical rates of survival (90% at 5 years for surgery) and impotency (90% for surgery and 40% for radiotherapy) representing published estimates, 32% of respondents were unwilling to trade off any survival, but 68% were willing to trade off a 10% or greater advantage in 5-year survival (by choosing radiotherapy) to maintain sexual potency. The median 5-year survival traded off was 10% (range, 0% to 80%). Willingness to trade off survival for sexual potency was significantly related to level of education, but not to age, interest in sex, frequency of sexual intercourse, or ability to achieve erection. We conclude that some men may choose treatment with lower long-term survival to increase their chance of remaining sexually potent. Because these men may be difficult to identify in clinical practice, physicians should thoroughly discuss both surgery and radiotherapy options with patients who have localized prostate cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Because cancer is the number one cause of mortality in Taiwan, a governmental decision was made to develop an experiment in medical oncology education using a United States-style training program in medical oncology in three Taipei, Taiwan, university hospitals. In the past, trainees from developing countries came to the United States or other foreign countries to receive specialty training. In doing so, the training did not necessarily prepare the individuals with skills to treat the indigenous cancers, nor did they work with other related specialists or support staff such as nursing and pharmacy, so important to providing good cancer care. This program involved 13 fellows with significant laboratory experience working with American faculty on-site. The major benefits of this model for oncology training are that the trainees developed important interdisciplinary relationships with local staff at each of the hospitals; they were involved in the treatment of the major cancer diseases of Taiwan such as nasopharyngeal, hepatocellular, and cervical cancers as well as breast, lung, and colon cancers; and they completed a certification process involving written and oral tests by two senior American oncologist examiners. Oncology services have been established at each of the hospitals and most of the fellows have expressed an interest or made arrangements to come to the United States to get additional research experience.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the dose intensity of chemotherapeutic regimens correlates with the complete remission rate in adult patients with advanced-stage intermediate-grade lymphoma, reports of comparative trials of therapy were reviewed. Reports were identified using MEDLINE, through references from review articles, and through review of selected abstracts. Twenty-two studies including 14 randomized and eight cohort trials were analyzed to assess projected dose intensity. Four other studies were analyzed to assess the role of received dose intensity. Dose intensities were calculated using described methods and correlated with complete remission rates. Individual trials were assessed using \"levels of evidence.\" A metaanalysis of randomized trials and a cross-trial analysis of all comparative trials using a weighted least squares linear regression were performed. Using levels of evidence, support was obtained for the hypothesis that dose intensity correlates with the remission rate from two trials in which dose intensity was \"indirectly\" tested. As these studies did not \"directly\" test dose intensity, confounding variables, including those arising from the assumptions made in calculating dose intensity, cannot be excluded. Metaanalysis showed a relative probability of achieving complete remission of 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.58) favoring the pooled arm of high dose intensity. Cross-trial analysis showed a relatively weak association between dose intensity and remission rate (r = .49, P = .0001). Two of four reports retrospectively assessing received dose intensity suggested that increased dose intensity is associated with superior remission rates. These analyses suggest that dose intensity may correlate with the remission rate in advanced-stage intermediate-grade lymphoma. However, properly designed trials directly testing dose intensity have not been performed and are needed to confirm this hypothesis.\r"

  ".W": "Traditionally, a number of variables have been used to predict outcome in patients with early-stage breast cancer. These tests are simple to perform and relatively inexpensive. Recently, a number of new factors, eg, tumor proliferative index, nuclear DNA content, and amplification or overexpression of growth-promoting genes or oncogenes have been identified as potential predictors of outcome in patients with breast cancer. There is now increasing pressure to introduce such tests into routine clinical practice. How does a clinical practitioner identify which test, or group of tests, best predicts adverse outcome and whether any more clinically useful information is provided than with the use of more traditional factors alone? The aim of a prognostic test in breast cancer is to predict which patients are destined to develop a recurrence of cancer and those who are not. The prognostic usefulness of a test can be expressed in terms of relative risk (RR), which is the ratio of the risk of breast cancer recurrence in patients who test positive to the risk in those who test negative. Methodologic guidelines that should be satisfied by a study evaluating the predictive ability of a test include the following: (1) Was an inception cohort assembled? (2) Was the referral pattern described? (3) Were laboratory and clinical outcomes assessed in a blinded fashion? (4) Was complete follow-up achieved? (5) Was adjustment for extraneous prognostic factors carried out? (6) Were appropriate statistical methods used? An approach is suggested to help the clinician choose the test, or combination of tests, likely to discriminate between \"high-\" and \"low-risk\" patients in his/her own practice. The decision regarding what particular threshold value (risk) defined by a prognostic test (or series of tests) warrants adjuvant therapy for an individual patient is a complex one but should be based on a clear presentation of the risks and benefits to the patient.\r"

The perioperative complication rate was 47.5%, with a 7.5% incidence of persistent sequelae: severe C-5 radiculopathy in one patient, swallowing dysfunction in one, and hypoglossal nerve palsy in one. No single factor (age, duration of symptoms, or severity of myelopathy) was absolutely predictive of outcome; however, syndromes of short duration had the best likelihood of cure. Similar outcomes were associated, individually, with long duration of symptoms, age over 70 years, and severe myelopathy. After factoring a 5% regression of improvement, the long-term cure rate was 57.5% and the failure rate was 15%. Myelopathy worsening was not documented.\r"

The components of the coaptation included the anterior primary rami of C-3 and C-4 as the donor material, the entire upper trunk as the recipient, and the sural nerve graft as the bridge. This procedure resulted in restoration of motor function in the biceps and shoulder-girdle muscles and produced improved sensation. Stimulation of the C-3 and C-4 nerve roots elicited electrical responses in the biceps and deltoid muscles that indicated nerve growth through the graft and the brachial plexus into these muscles. This reconstructive procedure is effective and should stimulate development of new approaches to treatment of cervical nerve root avulsion and proximal brachial plexopathy.\r"

The authors present the results of gait analysis on 14 children with spastic cerebral palsy, who underwent selective posterior rhizotomy in 1985. Sagittal plane gait patterns were studied before surgery and at 1 and 3 years after surgery using a digital camera system. The parameters measured included the range of motion at the knee and thigh, stride length, speed of walking, and cadence. The range of motion at the knee was significantly increased at 1 year after surgery and further improved to a nearly normal range at 3 years after surgery. In contrast, postoperative measurements of thigh range exceeded normal values at 1 year, but decreased toward normal range at 3 years. While improvements in range of motion continued between Years 1 and 3, the children developed a more extended thigh and knee position, which indicated a more upright walking posture. Stride length and speed of walking also improved, while cadence remained essentially unchanged. This 3-year follow-up study, the first to examine rhizotomy using an objective approach, has provided some encouraging results regarding early functional outcome.\r"

Bilateral clamps were used in 18 cases and unilateral clamps in three. Autogenous iliac bone grafting was performed in all cases but one. Follow-up periods ranged from 1 to 18 months (average 9.2 months), with no complications or mechanical failures occurring thus far. Follow-up diagnostic studies revealed rigid fixation and fusion in all cases. The MR imaging-compatibility of the clamps allowed excellent follow-up studies with minimal artifact. Because of their ease of use, rigid stabilization, good results, lack of complications, and compatibility with MR imaging, the Halifax interlaminar clamp with bone grafting provides an ideal method for posterior cervical stabilization.\r"

Follow-up examination was performed in all patients after a mean postoperative duration of 33.7 months.

If the sinus remains completely thrombosed, venous drainage from these lesions occurs through cortical veins, or, if the sinus is open, venous drainage is usually into the involved sinus. Among 105 patients with dural AV fistulas evaluated over the the past 5 years, seven had a unique type of dural AV fistula in the superior sagittal, transverse, or straight sinus in which only cortical venous drainage occurred despite a patent involved sinus; the fistula was located within the wall of a patent dural sinus, but outflow was not into the involved sinus. This variant of dural AV fistulas puts the patient at serious risk for hemorrhage or neurological dysfunction caused by venous hypertension. Three patients presented with hemorrhage, one with progressive neurological dysfunction, one with seizures, and two with bruit and headaches. A combination of surgical and endovascular techniques was used to close the fistula while preserving flow through the sinus.\r"

Despite these advances, controversy remains regarding the optimal role of these procedures in treating cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) and whether their purpose should be as a presurgical adjunct or as primary therapy. This controversy risks fragmentation between disciplines in the broader efforts to improve management of cerebrovascular disorders. The authors report seven cases of life-threatening hemorrhages that occurred during staged invasive therapy for AVM's which illustrate the value of a unified team approach to optimize patient care. Each patient underwent at least one embolization procedure using polyvinyl alcohol particles, followed in two cases by the occlusion of proximal feeding vessels by platinum microcoils and in one case by the attempted detachment of an endovascular balloon. In three patients, catheter penetration into the subarachnoid space resulted in subarachnoid hemorrhage. One patient suffered rupture of a large feeding vessel during balloon inflation. The final three patients sustained intracranial hemorrhage 2 hours, 8 hours, and 5 days, respectively, following embolization. All but two patients underwent emergency craniotomy at the time of the complication. These cases underscore the advantages of interdisciplinary management optimizing decision-making and providing expeditious care when life-threatening complications develop.\r"

  ".U": "91108524\r", 
  ".W": "Traumatic acute subdural hematoma remains one of the most lethal of all head injuries. Since 1981, it has been strongly held that the critical factor in overall outcome from acute subdural hematoma is timing of operative intervention for clot removal; those operated on within 4 hours of injury may have mortality rates as low as 30% with functional survival rates as high as 65%. Data were reviewed for 1150 severely head-injured patients (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores 3 to 7) treated at a Level 1 trauma center between 1982 and 1987; 101 of these patients had acute subdural hematoma. Standard treatment protocol included aggressive prehospital resuscitation measures, rapid operative intervention, and aggressive postoperative control of intracranial pressure (ICP). The overall mortality rate was 66%, and 19% had functional recovery. The following variables statistically correlated (p less than 0.05) with outcome; motorcycle accident as a mechanism of injury, age over 65 years, admission GCS score of 3 or 4, and postoperative ICP greater than 45 mm Hg. The time from injury to operative evacuation of the acute subdural hematoma in regard to outcome morbidity and mortality was not statistically significant even when examined at hourly intervals although there were trends indicating that earlier surgery improved outcome. The findings of this study support the pathophysiological evidence that, in acute subdural hematoma, the extent of primary underlying brain injury is more important than the subdural clot itself in dictating outcome; therefore, the ability to control ICP is more critical to outcome than the absolute timing of subdural blood removal.\r"

The authors report eight children who underwent ventriculoscopic fenestration of symptomatic loculated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collections. These CSF collections were either isolated ventricular cysts or trapped lateral ventricles secondary to obstruction at the foramen of Monro. Cyst wall dissection was carried out with a \"saline torch\" dissector which was introduced through a working channel in the ventriculoscope. The torch was used to coagulate vessels and to sculpt large windows in cyst walls or in the septum pellucidum. Ventriculoscope-guided cyst fenestration can be performed safely and easily under direct vision. The technique may permit simplification of shunt systems in some patients and elimination of shunts in others.\r"

  ".W": "The best operative intervention for children with arachnoid cysts remains the subject of controversy. Recent reports stress that craniotomy for cyst fenestration is associated with a low incidence of morbidity and mortality and may leave the child shunt-independent. The cases of 40 pediatric patients with arachnoid cysts treated between 1978 and 1989 are reported. Five children with mild symptoms and small cysts that remained stable on follow-up studies have not required surgical intervention. Of 15 patients with cysts initially treated by fenestration, 10 (67%) showed no clinical or radiographic improvement postoperatively and have undergone cyst-peritoneal (eight patients) or ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting (one patient), or revision of a VP shunt placed for hydrocephalus before cyst fenestration (one patient). Two other patients with existing VP shunts required no further procedures. Thus, only three (20%) of 15 patients initially treated by fenestration remain shunt-independent after a median follow-up period of 8 years. The 20 other patients were initially treated by cysts shunting and all improved postoperatively; shunt revision has been necessary in six (30%) of these 20 patients because of cysts recurrence. Cyst location influenced the success of shunt treatment; none of the seven middle cranial fossa cysts treated by shunting have required revision, but results with cysts in other locations were less favorable. In all locations, though, shunting was more successful than fenestration. It is concluded that cyst-peritoneal or cyst-VP shunting is the procedure of choice for arachnoid cysts in most locations, including those in the middle cranial fossa.\r"

  ".W": "Dorsal root ganglionectomy has been suggested as a method for the treatment of chronic intractable radicular pain, with theoretical advantages over dorsal rhizotomy, which does not interrupt ventral root afferents. The indications for these procedures in patients with persistent pain following lumbosacral spine surgery are not well established. Long-term results have been reported infrequently, and no published series has a mean follow-up period of more than 30 months. The authors have reviewed their experience with a series of 13 patients with failed back surgery syndrome, in whom dorsal root ganglionectomy was performed. Patients were selected on the basis of clinical presentation and diagnostic root blocks suggesting a monoradicular pain syndrome. Follow-up data were obtained at a mean of 5.5 years following dorsal root ganglionectomy. Follow-up interviews to assess outcome were conducted by a disinterested third party. Treatment \"success\" (at least 50% sustained relief of pain and patient satisfaction with the result) was recorded in two patients at 2 years after surgery and in none at 5.5 years. Equivocal success (at least 50% relief, without clearcut patient satisfaction) was recorded in one patient at 2 and at 5.5 years postoperatively. Improvements in activities of daily living were recorded in a minority of patients. Loss of sensory and motor function was reported frequently by patients. A minority of patients had reduced or eliminated analgesic intake. These results suggest that dorsal root ganglionectomy has a limited role in the management of failed back surgery syndrome, and that methods to select patients to receive this procedure should be refined or alternative approaches should be considered.\r"

  ".W": "In a review of autopsy material from two centers, 20 pituitary glands were found containing multiple adenomas. In total, 44 adenomas were identified histologically; 16 glands contained double tumors and in four glands triple adenomas were found. Size was measured in 30 tumors, all of which were microadenomas. Thirty-four adenomas were located in the lateral wings and 10 lay in the median wedge. Forty-one tumors were chromophobic and three were basophilic. Immunocytochemical analysis of the 44 tumors demonstrated the presence of prolactin in 11, adrenocorticotropic hormone in three, growth hormone in one, and alpha-subunit as well as follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in one. Of the 20 patients studied, there were 11 men and nine women, with an average age of 69 years. All patients died from various nonendocrine causes. With the exception of one patient who appeared mildly acromegalic, no correlation was observed between pituitary morphology and clinical data. This study found a 10.4% frequency of adenomas in pituitaries studied randomly at autopsy. Multiple tumors were encountered in 0.9% of cases. Despite its low frequency, adenoma multiplicity may underlie surgical failure in cases in which one adenoma is removed and the other is left behind.\r"

In one patient, recordings could not be obtained for technical reasons, and two patients had no abnormality. In the remaining eight patients, the abnormal response resolved before decompression in two, resolved immediately at the time of decompression in five, and failed to resolve in one. All patients were relieved of their hemifacial spasm. In the five patients whose abnormalities resolved at the time of decompression, there was a precise intraoperative correlation between decompression of the nerve and disappearance of the abnormal EMG response. In three cases, this was a useful guide to the need to decompress more than one vessel. These results confirm the findings of Moller and Jannetta, support the use of this technique for intraoperative monitoring of facial nerve decompression procedures, and provide strong circumstantial evidence that vascular cross-compression is an important etiological factor in hemifacial spasm.\r"

Cerebral aneurysms were produced by ligating one common carotid artery, inducing experimental hypertension, and feeding the animals beta-aminopropionitrile. After perfusion and fixation, samples of cerebral arterial bifurcations with shallow invaginations and with small aneurysms were obtained and used for analysis. Bifurcations in rats without experimental treatment were used as control specimens. Flow studies in the control bifurcations showed that the apical intimal pad, not the apex itself, acted as the flow divider. Small particles tended to accumulate at the region just distal to the apical intimal pad, where the initial aneurysmal changes are known to occur. This indicates stagnation of flow at that site. In the bifurcations with shallow invaginations and small aneurysms, a marked pressure gradient was present at the proximal end of the aneurysm orifice. A tendency for stagnation of small particles near the aneurysm wall was also observed. The wall shear stress was highest at the distal end of the aneurysmal orifice, which may be responsible for the development of these lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of etomidate, a nonbarbiturate cerebral metabolic depressant, on cerebral metabolism and blood flow were studied in 29 dogs during cerebral hypoperfusion. Three groups of animals were studied during a 45-minute normotensive and a 30-minute hypotensive period: 10 control animals without etomidate, 11 animals receiving a 0.1-mg/kg etomidate bolus followed by an infusion of 0.05 mg/kg/min etomidate (low-dose group), and eight animals receiving doses of etomidate sufficient to suppress electroencephalographic bursts (high-dose group). The mean arterial pressure fell to similar levels (p less than 0.05) during hypotension in all three groups (40 +/- 5, 38 +/- 3, and 27 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively). The mean cerebral oxygen extraction fraction rose (p less than 0.05) from 0.23 +/- 0.02 to 0.55 +/- 0.08 in the five control animals tested and from 0.33 +/- 0.02 to 0.53 +/- 0.02 in the seven animals tested in the low-dose group, but did not increase (p greater than 0.05) in the four animals tested in the high-dose group (0.24 +/- 0.03 to 0.23 +/- 0.05). Mean cerebral blood flow levels decreased in all groups during hypotension (p less than 0.05): 42 +/- 3 to 21 +/- 4 ml/100 gm/min (52% +/- 12% decrease) in the five animals tested in the control group, 60 +/- 8 to 24 +/- 6 ml/100 gm/min (56% +/- 13% decrease) in the four animals tested in the low-dose group, and 55 +/- 8 to 22 +/- 3 ml/100 gm/min (60% +/- 4% decrease) in the four animals tested in the high-dose group. In summary, the cerebral oxygen extraction fraction increased in the control animals and low-dose recipients during hypotension, suggesting the presence of threatened cerebral tissue. In contrast, the cerebral oxygen extraction did not change during hypotension when high-dose etomidate was administered. It is concluded that high-dose etomidate may preserve the cerebral metabolic state during hypotension in the present model.\r"

  ".W": "The degree of brain-stem dysfunction associated with high-level fluid-percussion injury (3.0 to 3.8 atm) was investigated in anesthetized cats. Measurements were made of the animals' intracranial pressure (ICP) pressure-volume index (PVI), far-field brain-stem auditory evoked responses (BAER's), and cerebral blood flow (CBF). The animals were classified into two groups based on the severity of neuropathological damage to the brain stem after trauma: Group 1 had mild intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhages and Group 2 had severe intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhages. The ICP values in Group 1 were insignificantly lower than those in Group 2, while the PVI values in Group 2 were clearly lower (p less than 0.05). Immediately after the injury, peaks II, III, and IV of the BAER's demonstrated a transitory and marked suppression. One Group 1 and two Group 2 animals showed the disappearance of peak V. In Group 1, the latencies of peak II, III, and IV gradually increased until 60 to 150 minutes postinjury, then returned to 95% of baseline value at 8 hours; however, the animals in Group 2 showed poor recovery of latencies. Two hours after brain injury, the CBF decreased to 40% of the preinjury measurement in both groups (p less than 0.001). In contrast to Group 2, the CBF in Group 1 returned to 86.8% of the preinjury measurement by 8 hours following the injury. Changes in PVI, BAER, and CBF correlated well with the degree of brain-stem injury following severe head injury. These data indicate that high-level fluid-percussion injury (greater than 3.0 atm) is predominantly a model of brain-stem injury.\r"

Histological examination of the seventh and eighth cranial nerve complex suggested nerve degeneration because increased numbers of corpora amylacea were present just distal to the compression concavity. There was no evidence of demyelination or gliosis of the nerve. This case suggests that vascular compression of the nerve root exit zone is an important condition in the etiology of most of these cases. This is the third reported case of familial hemifacial spasm; to date, all such patients have had left facial involvement. The family pedigree in this case suggests a pattern of autosomal-dominant inheritance with partial penetrance. The genetic basis for familial hemifacial spasm may involve anatomical variants or anomalies of the posterior circulation, since both posterior inferior cerebellar arteries were congenitally absent in this case.\r"

  ".W": "Of 165 consecutive patients undergoing computerized tomography- or magnetic resonance imaging-guided stereotactic brain biopsies at the Cleveland Clinic between June, 1987, and November, 1989, four patients (2.4%) developed arterial hemorrhage refractory to conventional efforts to secure hemostasis. Craniotomy was performed in one of these patients to control the hemorrhage; in the other three, 0.5 to 2 cc of thrombin (5000 U/cc) was slowly injected via the biopsy cannula, resulting in immediate control of bleeding in all three cases. Postoperatively, the first two patients treated with 1 to 2 cc of thrombin were slow to awaken; one had evidence of vasospasm by transcranial Doppler ultrasound studies and multiple infarcts on cranial computerized tomography, while the other had a moderate-sized frontal hematoma with intracranial hypertension. After prolonged recovery periods, only mild neurological deficits persisted in both patients. The third patient, treated with 0.5 cc of thrombin, had an uneventful postoperative course. Thrombin is highly effective for stopping intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy; however, it is a vasospastic agent and may have been responsible for the cerebral infarctions in one patient. Therefore, thrombin should be used only as a last resort, short of craniotomy, to control intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy.\r"

To compare myocardial cell metabolism with membrane dysfunction as indicators of necrosis/viability, 43 patients with evolving myocardial infarction and coronary arteriography had positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and the potassium analog 82Rb. Percent of heart showing FDG defects and 82Rb washout on sequential images indicating failure to retain the potassium analogue were visually assessed and quantified by automated software. Infarct size based on rubidium kinetics correlated closely with size and location on FDG images (visual r = 0.93, automated r = 0.82), suggesting that loss of cell membrane integrity for trapping the potassium analog 82Rb parallels loss of intracellular glucose metabolism, both comparable quantitative markers of myocardial necrosis/viability.\r"

Based on results of preclinical studies of rats and dogs and on previous literature about the fate of injected tracer-labeled catecholamines, dosimetric estimates for clinical studies are presented here. After injection of 1 mCi of [18F]-F-DA, the radiation dose would be highest to the wall of the urinary bladder (1.40 rem/mCi), due to accumulation of radioactive metabolites of [18F]-F-DA in urine. Radioactivity also would accumulate in bile. Organs receiving the next highest dose would be the kidneys (0.9 rem/mCi) and small intestine (0.2 rem/mCi). The parenchymal radiation dose would be lowest in the brain, since there is an effective blood-brain barrier for circulating catecholamines. Radiation doses to all organs after administration of 1 mCi of [18F]-F-DA to humans would be less than 3 rem and, therefore, within current FDA guidelines.\r"

  ".W": "It is generally accepted that the immunointegrity of an antibody (Ab) depends on the preservation of its antigen-binding sites. Our goal was to radiolabel an antibody at several iodine:antibody molar ratios under conditions protecting its combining site and to compare its immunoreactive fraction (IRF) and electrophoretic mobility with those of the same antibody radiolabeled without protection. The data indicate that an antibody radiolabeled while its antigen-binding site is occupied by its antigen had the same IRF, regardless of the number of iodine atoms per antibody molecule. On the other hand, even at an I:Ab ratio of 1:1, the IRF of the same antibody radiolabeled without protection was lower than that of a protected one and decreased with increasing I:Ab ratios. In addition, the iodination of these Ab changes their electrophoretic mobility; however, when the Ab is labeled in the protected state, the degree of change is less. The binding of an antibody to its antigen prior to radiolabeling, therefore, enhances its immuno-integrity and prevents major conformational changes as reflected by electrophoresis.\r"

We compared shunt fraction estimates from paired transcolonic IMP and TcO4- studies performed on a group of dogs before and after common bile duct ligation surgery. Pertechnetate over-estimated shunt fraction in 6/7 postoperative studies relative to IMP. A good correlation between the two methods was demonstrated, however, the slope of the regression line was substantially less than 1.0 with TcO4- values reaching 100% at IMP shunt values of approximately 60%. This apparent inability to accurately assess high shunt flows may limit the quantitative aspects of TcO4- studies on patients with severe portosystemic shunting.\r"

Phantom studies were the principal tools used. Volumes of fillable organs within a tissue-equivalent anthropomorphic phantom were determined over a wide range (145-1960 ml) to within 6% by using a thresholding technique. Additionally, phantom studies with nonuniform activity distributions were made. These included a background of activity and hot as well as cold lesions. The hot lesion was computed to within 12% (111In) and 7.7% (99mTc), and contrast in the cold lesion was approximately 70% for both isotopes. The CHT algorithm incorporates the energy-distance relation (EDR) which minimizes the degrading effects of attenuation, scatter, collimator blur and poor statistics.\r"

Both static and dynamic frames of independent and simultaneous studies are compared. The noise effective count rate is reduced to 62% of the value during normal studies. However, the increase in the coefficient of variation in cortical regions is less than 6%. The RMS difference between profile contours through many brain regions is approximately 40% higher comparing two simultaneous emission/transmission scans than when the same analysis is performed on independent emission scans. This difference appears to be due to the noise patterns arising from the use of different transmission scans.\r"

The technique segments the transmission image into anatomic regions by thresholding the histogram of the attenuation values corresponding to different regions such as soft tissue and lungs. Average values of attenuation are derived from these regions and new attenuation correction factors are computed by forward projection of these regions into sinograms for correction of emission images. The technique has been tested with phantom studies and with clinical cardiac studies in patients for 30- and 10-min attenuation scan times. This method for attenuation correction was linearly correlated (slope = 0.937 and r2 = 0.935) with the standard directly measured method, reducing noise in the final image, and reducing the attenuation scan time.\r"

  ".U": "91108566\r", 
  ".W": "The development of effective therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals requires careful consideration in the selection of the radionuclide. The in vivo targeting and clearance properties of the carrier molecule must be balanced with the decay properties of the attached radionuclide. Radionuclides for therapeutic applications fall into three general categories: beta-particle emitters, alpha-particle emitters, and Auger and Coster-Kronig-electron emitters following electron capture. Alpha particles and Auger electrons deposit their energy over short distances with a high LET that limits the ability of cells to repair damage to DNA. Despite their high levels of cytotoxicity, the relatively short range of alpha particles requires binding of the carrier molecule to most cancer cells within a tumor in order to be effective. Because of the extremely short range of Auger electrons, the radionuclide must be carried directly into the nucleus to elicit high radiotoxicity, making it necessary to deliver the radionuclide to every cell within a tumor cell population. These characteristics impose rigid restrictions on the nature of the carrier molecules for these types of particle emitters but successful targeting of these types of radionuclides could result in high therapeutic ratios. Most beta-emitting radionuclides are produced in nuclear rectors via neutron capture reactions; however, a few are produced in charged-particle accelerators. For radionuclides produced by direct neutron activation, the quantities and specific activities that can be produced are determined in large part by the cross-section of the target isotope and the flux of the reactor. Many applications (e.g., therapeutic bone agents, radiolabeled microspheres, radiocolloids) do not require high-specific activities and can therefore utilize the wide range of radionuclides that can be produced in sufficient quantity by direct neutron activation. Other applications (e.g., MAb labeling) require high-specific activity radionuclides in order to deliver a sufficient number of radionuclide atoms to the target site without saturating the target or compromising the integrity of the carrier molecule. Most radionuclides, produced at NCA levels in reactors, are produced via indirect reactions. High-specific activity beta emitters can also be obtained from radionuclide generator systems where the longer-lived parent radionuclide may be obtained from direct neutron activation, as a fission product, or from charged-particle accelerators. It is essential that the half-life of a radionuclide used in RNT be compatible with the rates of localization in target tissues and clearance of the carrier molecule from normal tissues. This consideration is especially important for the various MAbs and their fragments that are currently under investigation as carrier molecules to RIT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Fifty-two patients received a therapeutic dose of 20 mCi of iodine-131 (131I). Duration of follow-up was 10 +/- 4 yr. Follow-up data included a biochemical evaluation of thyroid function. The failure rate (recurrent hyperthyroidism) was 2%. The incidence of hypothyroidism was 6% and was not related to the dose per gram of nodular tissue. Oral administration of 20 mCi of radioiodine is a simple and highly effective method for the treatment of patients with a toxic autonomous thyroid nodule. The risk of development of hypothyroidism is low if extranodular uptake of 131I is prevented. This can be achieved by not treating euthyroid patients, by no longer using injections of exogenous thyroid stimulating hormone in the diagnostic work-up of the patients and by always performing radioiodine imaging shortly before treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A new, miniature cesium iodide/photodiode nuclear probe (the \"Cardioscint\") has been developed for continuous on-line measurement of left ventricular function and the ST-segment. Ejection fraction (EF) measurements in 77 patients were compared with gated equilibrium radionuclide ventriculograms. The probe was positioned over the left ventricle by first using a blind positioning algorithm and then by using the gamma camera. Background was measured both manually and automatically. There was good correlation between probe (positioned blind) and gamma camera EF with both manual (r = 0.80, n = 65) and automatic (r = 0.78, n = 66) backgrounds. Use of the gamma camera did not significantly alter the results. Correlation between the probe stroke counts and thermodilution-derived stroke index during atrial pacing in six subjects was also satisfactory (r = 0.69, n = 102). Thus, the Cardioscint is able to provide a reliable estimate of EF and can track rapid changes in cardiac volumes.\r"

In 18 controls subjects, the HEF was 100% and the T-1/2 excretion mean +/- s.e. value was 15.23 +/- 1.4 min. The mean appearance times of the common bile duct (CBD), gallbladder (GB), and small intestine were 15.8 +/- 1.52, 20.2 +/- 2.7, and 23.8 +/- 3.08 min, respectively. Rising serum bilirubin in patients decreased HEF and increased T-1/2 excretion value resulting in delayed appearance of CBD, GB, and small intestine. In control subjects and patients with bilirubin less than 5 mg%, T-1/2 excretion values at 30, 40, and 50 min were similar to those values calculated using the entire 60 min of data, suggesting that the hepatic phase study time could be reduced to 30-40 min and still use the normal reference values established for 60 min. In patients with bilirubin greater than 5 mg%, the data collection duration should be continued for 60 min.\r"

Animals were serially imaged by radiography, three-phase technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) scintigraphy, and 111In-Cl scintigraphy. There was a significant difference between infected (1.93) and noninfected (1.32) limb's tibia/femur count density ratios on 24-hr (p = 0.0001) and 72-hr (p = 0.0001) 111In-Cl images.

In vivo, there was high accumulation of 4-[125I]iododexetimide in the rat atrium and ventricle which could be blocked by approximately 60% by preinjection of atropine. In contrast, accumulation of the radiolabeled stereoisomer, 4-[125I]iodolevetimide, was 63% lower than 4-[125I]iodolevetimide and was not blocked by atropine. The blood clearance of 4-[125I]iododexetimide was rapid, providing heart-to-blood ratios of up to 14:1; however, heart-to-lung and heart-to-liver ratios were below unity. The data indicate that 4-[125I]iododexetimide binds potently to rat mAChR. However, since nonspecific binding is relatively high, it is not clear whether iododexetimide labeled with 123I will be useful in SPECT imaging studies of myocardial mAChR. Further studies in humans are indicated.\r"

This compound was synthesized in eight steps from 7 alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone, with fluorine introduced in the penultimate step by fluoride ion displacement on a spirocyclic sulfate. Fluoromibolerone was obtained in 9%-19% radiochemical yield (decay corrected), at 1.5 hr after bombardment, with an effective specific activity of 217-283 Ci/mmol. The relative binding affinity of F-Mib is 53 (versus R1881 = 100 or mibolerone = 118). In tissue distribution studies in diethylstilbestrol-treated male rats, 18F-Mib demonstrates high target/tissue uptake efficiency and selectivity: the prostate uptake at 0.5 hr and 4 hr is 1.0%-1.3% injected dose/gram tissue (ID/g) and 0.5%-0.6% ID/g, respectively; the prostate-to-blood and the prostate-to-muscle (non-target) ratios are both ca. 4 at 0.5 hr, and increase to ca. 12 by 4 hr after injection. The observed distribution of 18F-Mib suggests that it may be useful for in vivo imaging of prostatic tumors in man by positron emission tomography.\r"

To determine if degranulated eosinophils are suitable targets for immunolocalization, we performed in vivo distribution and imaging studies in mice, using EOS (a murine monoclonal antibody directed to human eosinophil peroxidase) labeled with indium-111. Adult mice were injected intravenously with radiolabeled EOS antibody or with similarly radiolabeled normal mouse IgG before receiving an intramuscular injection into the right thigh of homogenized human eosinophils adsorbed to latex microspheres. There was striking localization in the right thigh of the radiolabeled EOS antibody detectable by gamma imaging techniques as soon as 24 hr after injection. By contrast, there was little accumulation of radiolabeled normal IgG in the right thigh. We conclude that human eosinophil peroxidase is potentially a suitable target for radioimmunodetection and therapy of neoplasms and pathologic conditions that contain degranulating eosinophils.\r"

NPX and SO rats that were given a toxic 2.5-mumol/kg dose of HgCl2 developed severe renal damage within 24 hr after the HgCl2 was administered. Renal injury was assessed by measuring plasma creatinine, creatinine clearance, fractional excretion of several biological markers, the rate of excretion of cellular enzymes and plasma solutes and severity of morphologically demonstrable necrosis in the pars recta of proximal tubules. When a 10-mg/kg dose of DMPS was given to the NPX and SO rats 1 hr after treatment with the 2.5-mumol/kg dose of HgCl2, the nephropathy induced by the dose of HgCl2 was less severe. Moreover, the NPX rats had significantly less severe renal damage than did the SO rats. Renal damage was completely absent from both NPX and SO rats that were given a 100-mg/kg dose of DMPS 1 hr after treatment with the 2.5-mumol/kg dose of HgCl2. These data indicate that at the 10-mg/kg dose of DMPS, NPX rats are protected against the nephrotoxic effects of a 2.5-mumol/kg dose of HgCl2 to a greater extent than are SO rats. Moreover, the data show that complete rescue from the 2.5-mumol/kg dose of HgCl2 is afforded to NPX and SO rats given 100 mg/kg of DMPS within 1 hr after treatment with HgCl2. This complete rescue is afforded for at least 24 hr. Based on the present findings DMPS may prove to be a useful rescue agent against the acute nephropathy induced by HgCl2.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to characterize serotonergic receptor activation in rat stomach fundus, the potential role of protein kinases, more specifically protein kinase C (PKC), in serotonin-induced contraction of rat stomach fundus was examined. Staurosporine, a potent, but nonselective, inhibitor of protein kinases, attenuated basal, membrane-bound PKC activity in rat stomach fundus (IC50 = 10 nM). Although staurosporine (3-100 nM) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of contractions elicited by serotonin (which does not increase phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in the fundus), carbamylcholine (an agent stimulating phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis), and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu; a phosphatidylinositol-independent activator of PKC translocation), it was a more potent inhibitor of contractions produced by serotonin and PDBu than by carbamylcholine. Potassium chloride-induced contractions were attenuated minimally by staurosporine. These results raised the possibility that serotonin might exert an effect on protein kinase activity by a phosphatidylinositol-independent mechanism. Focusing on PKC, serotonin's ability to translocate PKC from cytosol to membrane in rat fundus was examined. Concentrations of serotonin (0.1-10 microM) which maximally contracted rat fundus did not translocate PKC. However, PDBu (10 nM-1 microM) and carbamylcholine (0.1-10 microM) significantly increased membrane-bound PKC activity. These results: 1) demonstrate that translocation of PKC occurred in rat stomach fundus in response to some, but not all, contractile agonists; 2) are consistent with the possibility that contraction of rat stomach fundus by carbamylcholine and PDBu may be related to increased membrane-bound PKC activity; and 3) indicate that serotonin-induced contraction, although potently blocked by staurosporine, did not result from PKC translocation in the rat stomach fundus.\r"

  ".W": "Vascular responses to endothelin were examined with special reference to prostaglandins (PGs). Intrarenal infusion of endothelin (ET)-1 (1-5 ng/kg/min) to dogs caused a transient increase followed by a sustained decrease in renal blood flow, with no change in blood pressure or heart rate. Renal secretion rates of PGE2 and I2 (determined as 6-keto PGF1 alpha) were increased with ET, dose-dependently, and the intrarenal infusion of ET (5 ng/kg/min) elevated the systemic arterial concentration of 6-keto PGF1 alpha from 26 +/- 5 to 83 +/- 14 pg/ml. Because this increase in PG secretion was not affected by the platelet activating factor antagonist, CV 6209, it is unlikely that ET-induced renal PG production was platelet activating factor-mediated. Pretreatment with aspirin abolished completely the increased PG secretion elicited by ET and potentiated the ET-induced reduction renal blood flow. Intrafemoral infusion of ET (5 ng/kg/min) also induced an initial increase followed by a gradual decrease in femoral blood flow, without any increase in PG secretion from the hindlimb. Aspirin had no effects on the femoral hemodynamic action of ET. In addition, initial transient increases in either renal or femoral blood flow by endothelin were not affected by aspirin. Thus, the ET-induced production of renal PGs counteracts the renal vasoconstrictor action of ET, an event in marked contrast to the lack of any apparent involvement of PGs in the femoral hemodynamic action of ET. The ET-induced transient vasodilation shows no apparent relation to the cyclooxygenase products.\r"

  ".W": "It has been demonstrated previously that parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrp) has potent vasodilatory and cardiac stimulatory properties. However, the systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of PTHrp are unknown. In order to characterize these effects, we utilized the radioactive microsphere technique to examine the systemic and regional hemodynamics before and 2 min after the i.v. bolus administration of 0.03, 0.3 and 3.0 micrograms/ml/100 g b.wt. of PTHrp in conscious, unrestrained, normal rats. These effects were compared to those of synthetic rat parathyroid hormone (PTH), an agent known to affect cardiovascular function. PTHrp and PTH similarly and significantly decreased mean systemic blood pressure and total peripheral resistance but increased heart rate and cardiac output, all in a dose-dependent manner. Both peptides increased blood flow and decreased vessel resistance in regional vascular beds such as skin and heart. Renal resistance was reduced by PTH and PTHrp, but renal blood flow was not altered. Conversely, both peptides significantly decreased blood flow and increased vascular resistance to the splanchnic organs. Thus, PTHrp as well as PTH, preserved and enhanced cardiac function in the face of reduced systemic blood pressure while maintaining renal flow. These features are highly desirable in the treatment of some severe cardiovascular abnormalities. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PTHrp may play an important hormonal, autocrine or paracrine role in systemic and regional blood flow regulation.\r"

In the present studies, behavioral and neurochemical interactions between cocaine and buprenorphine were examined using a conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure and in vivo microdialysis. Cocaine-induced CPP was linearly related to the dose administered (0-5.0 mg/kg). Buprenorphine (0-0.9 mg/kg) also elicited CPP in a dose-related manner; an inverted U-shaped function was obtained. Subthreshold doses of cocaine (1.5 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg), themselves incapable of eliciting CPP, produced a significant CPP when given together. Moderate doses of cocaine (5.0 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.075 mg/kg), which were individually capable of eliciting CPP, produced a significantly larger CPP when given in combination. In the in vivo microdialysis studies, a low dose of buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg) produced a progressive increase in extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, reaching approximately 200% of basal levels after 5 hr. Cocaine (5.0 mg/kg) rapidly increased extracellular dopamine concentrations (180% of basal values within 20 min), which returned to baseline in 2 to 3 hr. This effect of cocaine was significantly potentiated by coadministering buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg); under this condition the peak increase in extracellular dopamine reached 260% of baseline values. These neurochemical findings are consistent with the CPP results and indicate that buprenorphine can interact with cocaine in a synergistic manner. In contrast to previous speculations, these results suggest that buprenorphine may enhance rather than attenuate the rewarding properties of cocaine.\r"

The relative amplitude of the phasic and tonic components of the contraction and its reproducibility were dependent on the concentration of K+ used. Only concentrations higher than 80 mM (i.e., 120 mM) showed a tonic component greater in amplitude than the phasic one and manifested a tachyphylactic effect. Phentolamine (10(-6) M), prazosin (10(-6) M) and chemical denervation with 6-hydroxydopamine significantly inhibited the tonic component of the K+ (120 mM)-induced contraction, modifying its morphology. Reproducible contractions to K+ (120 mM) could be obtained in the presence of prazosin (10(-6) M) or cocaine (10(-6) M). The preparations were also shown to accumulate [3H]noradrenaline and release it upon depolarization with K+ (60 and 120 mM). Calcium removal inhibited the K+ (120 mM)-induced contraction. After addition of calcium (0.5-5 mM) the contractile activity was restored. Nifedipine (10(-6) M) and verapamil (10(-6) M) but not sodium nitroprusside (10(-6) M) significantly blocked the contractile response for calcium as well as the phasic component of the K+ contraction in calcium-containing medium. In preparations treated with prazosin (10(-6) M) the tonic component of the K+ (120 mM) contraction was more sensitive to nifedipine and removal of extracellular calcium than the phasic one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Acetylcholine (ACh)-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca++]i) and tension were measured simultaneously in swine tracheal smooth muscle strips loaded with the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura-2. ACh at concentrations greater than or equal to 3 x 10(-8) M induced concentration-dependent increases in tension which reached a maximum at 10(-4) M. Increases in [Ca++]i occurred at all [ACh] tested (10(-8) to 10(-4) M). After addition of ACh at concentrations greater than 3 x 10(-7) M, [Ca++]i increased rapidly to a concentration dependent-peak then declined to a concentration-independent steady state approximately 250 nM above the resting [Ca++]i of 257 +/- 12 nM. There was a steep relationship (slope factor greater than 3) between the peak tension and the peak [Ca++]i reached at each [ACh]. The rate of decline of [Ca++]i to the steady state at [ACh] greater than 73 x 10(-7) M was well correlated with the peak [Ca++]i reached. We conclude that the peak increase in calcium induced by ACh sets the level of tension to be attained and the rate of decline of the transient increase in [Ca++]i. The steady-state [Ca++]i is sufficient for maintenance of tension.\r"

  ".W": "A series of mu and kappa opioid agonists with varying degrees of selectivity were evaluated for their agonist and antagonist effects in squirrel monkeys trained to discriminate either the selective mu agonist fentanyl or the selective kappa agonist U50,488 from water. In the fentanyl-trained monkeys, fentanyl, as well as the less selective mu agonists buprenorphine and (-)-metazocine, produced dose-dependent and complete substitution for the training stimulus. U50,488 produced neither agonist nor antagonist effects in the fentanyl-trained monkeys, but the less selective kappa agonists bremazocine and tifluadom generally produced either agonist or antagonist effects, depending on the monkey tested. In the U50,488-trained monkeys, U50,488, bremazocine and tifluadom all produced a dose-dependent and complete substitution for the training stimulus. Fentanyl produced neither agonist nor antagonist effects in the U50,488-trained monkeys, but buprenorphine and (-)-metazocine antagonized the discriminative stimulus effects of U50,488. The inability of the selective mu agonist fentanyl and the selective kappa agonist U50,488 to antagonize each other's discriminative stimulus effects suggests that the stimulus effects mediated by mu and kappa opioid receptors in squirrel monkeys do not interact with a common biologic substrate. Rather, these results suggest that the stimulus effects mediated by mu and kappa receptors function independently of one another. Interactions involving the less selective mu agonists buprenorphine and (-)-metazocine, or the less selective kappa agonists bremazocine and tifluadom, can be explained on the basis of the low receptor selectivity of these drugs.\r"

In coronary artery with and without endothelium, only 5-HT and alpha-methylserotonin maleate (5-HT2 agonist) elicited equipotent concentration-dependent contractions. The EC50 values for 5-HT and alpha-methylserotonin maleate in endothelium-intact arteries were 4.7 x 10(-7) and 4.5 x 10(-7) M, respectively, whereas in endothelium-denuded arteries they were 2.8 x 10(-7) and 1.9 x 10(-7) M, respectively. The other subtype agonists, such as (+/-)-8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin hydrobromide (5-HT1A agonist), 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine dihydrochloride and 7-trifluoromethyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-pyrrolo(1,2-a)quinoxaline (5-HT1B) and 2-methyl-serotonin maleate (5-HT3), only elicited a small percentage of the maximum contraction to 5-HT. In prostaglandin F2 alpha-precontracted coronary arteries with intact endothelium or denuded of endothelium, the addition of 5-HT resulted in a further increase in tension. No relaxation was observed with 5-HT up to 1 x 10(-5) M. The contraction induced by 5-HT in artery both with and without endothelium was inhibited by ketanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) but not by l-propranolol (5-HT1 antagonist) nor by 3-tropanyl-indole-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (5-HT3 antagonist). Ketanserin, the selective 5-HT2 antagonist, effectively antagonized 5-HT-induced contraction by shifting the 5-HT response curve to the right without inhibiting the maximal response in both endothelium-intact and -denuded arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In CA1 pyramidal cells freshly isolated from the rat hippocampus, the low-threshold (T-type) Ca++ current was induced by step depolarization to potentials more positive than about -60 mV from a holding potential of -100 mV, and reached a peak in the current-voltage relationship around -30 mV. The activation and inactivation processes of the current were highly potential-dependent, and the latter was fitted by a single exponential function. Organic and inorganic Ca++ antagonists dose dependently blocked T-type Ca++ channel in the order of flunarizine greater than nicardipine greater than D600 greater than diltiazem and La greater than Zn++ greater than Cd++ greater than Ni++ greater than Co++, respectively. The inhibitory effects of flunarizine, nicardipine and D600 were voltage- and use-dependent. It was concluded that rat hippocampal neurons possessed a definite class of T-type Ca++ channel characterized by the current kinetics and the high sensitivity to organic Ca++ antagonists. The pharmacologic nature differed from that in other tissues such as cardiac and smooth muscle cells, peripheral neurons and cultured cells.\r"

Approximately 60% of the urine and fecal radiolabel 6 and 12 hr postinjection was the parent toxin. Hepatic cytosol, which contained 70 +/- 2% of the hepatic radiolabel (1 hr through 6 days), was prepared for high-performance liquid chromatography analysis by heat denaturation, pronase digestion and C18 Sep Pak extraction. At 1 hr, 35 +/- 2% of the radiolabel was insoluble or C18 Sep Pak-bound; 43 +/- 3% was associated with a peak of retention time (rt) 6.6 min, and 16 +/- 3% with the parent toxin (rt 9.4 min). After 6 days, 8 +/- 1% was C18 Sep Pak-bound or insoluble; 5 +/- 0% occurred at rt 6.6 min, 17 +/- 1% with parent and 60 +/- 2% was associated with rt 8.1 min. Two other peaks, rt 4.9 and 5.6 min, appeared transiently. Analysis of hepatic cytosol by desalting chromatography under nondenaturing and denaturing conditions revealed that all of the radiolabel was associated with cytosolic components, and 83 +/- 5% was bound covalently through 1 day. By day 6 the amount of covalently bound isotope decreased to 42 +/- 11%. This is the first study to describe the long-term hepatic retention of microcystin toxin and documents putative detoxication products.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of various blockers of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-activated ionic channel on noncontractile slow Ca++ mobilization were investigated at the neuromuscular synapse of aequorin-injected diaphragm muscles of mice. Intracellular Ca++ mobilization (Ca++ transients) was evoked in the presence of neostigmine (0.3 microM) by nerve stimulation. Bupivacaine, an open channel blocker, decreased the peak amplitude, whereas chlorpromazine, a closed channel blocker, shortened the duration. Phencyclidine, an open and closed channel blocker, decreased both peak amplitude and duration. beta-Eudesmol, a compound of Atractylodes lancea, clearly and specifically shortened the duration but had little effect on peak amplitude. All the above channel blockers, when given in the same concentration ranges, also blocked the total amount of contractile Ca++ transients. The effects of bupivacaine, chlorpromazine and phencyclidine on noncontractile Ca++ transients were not affected by 5 mM [Ca++]o, whereas the effect of beta-eudesmol was enhanced. Geographutoxin II (0.3 microM), a skeletal muscle Na+ channel blocker, selectively and partly reversibly blocked contractile Ca++ transients without affecting noncontractile ones. These results suggest that: 1) the activation of noncontractile Ca++ mobilization is suppressed by open channel blockers, whereas its desensitization is accelerated by closed channel blockers and 2) activation of the muscle Na+ channel and subsequent release of Ca++ from sarcoplasmic reticulum is not involved in the mechanism of noncontractile Ca++ mobilization. It may reflect the steps of the desensitization process.\r"

  ".W": "The hemodynamic effects of sarafotoxin S6b (SRT) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were studied in conscious, freely moving rats. Intravenous bolus administration of ET-1 produced an initial transient depressor response and skeletal muscle (hindquarters) vasodilation. This depressor activity was not observed after i.v. SRT except at a high dose. The initial fall in blood pressure was followed by a sustained pressor response and an increase in total peripheral resistance which were mediated, at least partially, by visceral (mesenteric) and skeletal muscle (hindquarters) vasoconstriction. The durations of the pressor responses and times required to achieve the peak pressor effects (peak time) were greater for ET-1 as compared to SRT. The results of qualitatively similar sustained hemodynamic effects and the strong correlation between the amplitude of the responses to ET-1 and SRT in individual rats suggest that the sustained pressor responses to these peptides are mediated by the same receptors, although the potency was significantly greater for ET-1 than for SRT. Furthermore, the initial depressor and sustained pressor responses appear to be mediated by distinct receptor subtypes inasmuch as the same dose of ET-1 was required for both vasodilator and vasoconstrictor activity but a higher dose of SRT was required to elicit its vasodilator as compared to constrictor effects. Thus, SRT may have relatively lower affinity for receptors mediating its initial hemodynamic responses whereas ET-1 binds with equal affinity to both receptors. These potent and vascular specific hemodynamic actions suggest a role of endothelin in regulating cardiovascular function.\r"

The purpose of this study was to distinguish these types of contractions in the feline lower esophageal sphincter (LES) through use of i.v. selective pharmacologic antagonists. Continuous infusion of the calcium channel antagonist verapamil (16-128 micrograms/kg/min) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of bethanechol induced and tonic pressure change. At 32.0 micrograms/kg/min, verapamil produced significantly greater inhibition of bethanechol induced contractions when compared with inhibition of basal LES tone (57.4 versus 4.8%, P less than .02, n = 5). Verapamil also caused a parallel decrease in LES spike activity associated with bethanechol induced contractions. In contrast, lower doses of nitroprusside (0.5 micrograms/kg/min) inhibited LES tone by over 50% (50.6 +/- 21.8%) yet had no significant effect (16.8 +/- 23.4%) on bethanechol induced contractions. Also, inhibition of basal LES tone correlated poorly with its effect on associated spike activity. It is concluded that in the in vivo feline LES, spike dependent cholinergic contractions can be distinguished from LES tone by the use of low dose verapamil and nitroprusside, respectively. This selective inhibition suggests that two cellular mechanisms mediate LES contractions and that these pathways can be distinguished pharmacologically in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The acute administration of cocaine (5-20 mg/kg) to rats produced a dose-dependent elevation in both serum corticosterone and plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). These elevations were maximal at 30 min and returned to basal values by 60 min. The dopamine (DA) uptake blockers GBR12909 and nomifensine, the norepinephrine uptake blocker desipramine, as well as the serotonin (5-HT) uptake blocker fluoxetine, also stimulated hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, whereas the local anesthetic procaine did not. Pretreatment with haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the elevations in corticosterone and ACTH elicited by cocaine, as well as the elevation in ACTH produced by GBR12909. Higher doses of haloperidol (1 or 3 mg/kg) also attenuated the HPA response to cocaine and GBR12909. Pretreatment with the D1 antagonist SCH23390, the D2 antagonist sulpiride, the D1/D2 antagonist fluphenazine, or the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin significantly decreased the ACTH elevations after cocaine. In contrast, neither the 5-HT antagonist cyproheptadine, the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin nor the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol attenuated the ACTH response to cocaine. The present results suggest an important stimulatory role for DA in regulation of HPA activity, and a role for both DA and 5-HT in the adrenocortical stimulation by cocaine. Both D1 and D2 receptors appear to be involved in the dopaminergic component of this response.\r"

Peak plasma levels and distribution phase half-lives for dl-, l- and d-KC were similar, indicating no major dispositional differences between the isomers of KC despite a trend for d-KC to have a longer elimination half-life, slower plasma clearance and a greater apparent volume of distribution than l-KC. Although a relatively low dose of naltrexone (0.01 mg/kg) was sufficient to shift morphine dose-effect curves to the right, this dose of naltrexone was not sufficient to shift the dose-effect curves of dl-KC to the right. A dose of 1 mg/kg of naltrexone was required, consistent with the view that the effects were mediated by kappa opioid receptors. The overall pharmacological profile of l-KC differed from that of the more selective kappa opioid agonist U-50,488H, which produced both stimulatory and sedative effects. Neither l-KC nor U-50,488H produced pharmacological profiles typical of the sigma agonist d-N-allylnormetazocine or phencyclidine. The data suggest that the pharmacological activity of KC resides in the l-enantiomer, that the effects are kappa opioid receptor-mediated and that the binding of d-KC to haloperidol-sensitive sigma receptors does not produce N-allylnormetazocine- or phencyclidine-like actions in the dog.\r"

Uptake of 45Ca2+ by mitochondria and release of 45Ca2+ from preloaded mitochondria were measured in the presence and absence of ATP. Release of 45Ca2+ from preloaded mitochondria by MeHg was measured in the presence and absence of ruthenium red (RR), a putative inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake uniporter. During incubation intervals ranging from 10 sec to 5 min, 10 microM MeHg reduced mitochondrial uptake of 45Ca2+ by about 50% and 100 microM MeHg completely prevented 45Ca2+ uptake. These effects of MeHg occurred in both the presence and absence of ATP. Exposure of mitochondria preloaded with 45Ca2+ to either 10 microM or 100 microM MeHg for 10 sec resulted in increased efflux of 45Ca2+ of 10% and 65%, respectively, in both the absence and presence of ATP. Loading mitochondria with 45Ca2+ in the presence of 20 microM RR reduced total uptake of 45Ca2+ and greatly attenuated MeHg-induced release of 45Ca2+ from mitochondria. RR did not inhibit the effects of MeHg on Ca2+ release by merely preventing the binding of MeHg to mitochondria because RR did not alter mitochondrial binding of methyl[203Hg]. The ratio of state 3 to state 4 respiration (respiratory control ratio) was measured as a means of assessing functional integrity of isolated mitochondria in the absence and presence of MeHg. Control ratios of from 3 to 5 were only marginally reduced by 2 microM MeHg but were greatly reduced by 10 and 20 microM MeHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mouse diaphragm muscles were pretreated for 30 to 60 min with 3 to 40 microM bupivacaine, chlorpromazine, phencyclidine and beta-eudesmol. The effects of these noncompetitive blockers on the succinylcholine-induced response were also compared with those for pancuronium. These channel blockers potentiated (2- to 10-fold) both the blocking effects on intracellular Ca++ and twitch tension of succinylcholine (13-100 microM), but not the pancuronium (0.3-1.1 microM)-induced block. These channel blockers also suppressed succinylcholine (1.3-5 microM)-induced enhancement of evoked Ca++ transients. On the other hand, the channel blockers inhibited the succinylcholine (2.5-100 microM)-induced increase in basal Ca++ transients. These results suggest that neuromuscular block induced by succinylcholine is mainly due to desensitization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.\r"

Cardiac microsomal and mitochondrial NAD(P)H-dependent metabolism of the quinones and consequent generation of superoxide anion (O2.-) were also measured. Mixed redox cycling/alkylating 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, redox cycling 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone and alkylating p-benzoquinone determined concentration-dependent positive inotropic responses, whereas redox cycling 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-benzoquinone had no effect. The positive inotropic effect of 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone was completely catecholamine-mediated, that of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone was approximately 70% adrenergic and 30% direct. p-Benzoquinone acted directly on heart muscle. In time, quinones with alkylating properties caused increases in the resting force of atria, whereas redox cycling quinones did not produce toxic effects. Mitochondrial NADH-oxidoreductase accounted for 90 to 95% of the metabolism of all quinones, whereas the contribution of the microsomal pathway was negligible. Considerable amounts of O2.- were produced by mitochondrial biotransformation of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone and 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone but not of 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-benzoquinone and p-benzoquinone, suggesting a kind of relation between O2.- generation and the release of catecholamines.\r"

In the present study, we investigated the effect of cocaine on superoxide anion (O2-) production, an index of a microbicidal activity, by cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Release of O2- was measured by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome C in response to phorbol myristate acetate. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in the presence of cocaine (1 microM) for 48 hr released less (P less than .05) O2- than did nontreated control cells (95.1 +/- 10.2 vs. 57.9 +/- 6.6 nmol/10(7) cells/60 min, respectively). This suppressive effect was dose-dependent. Antibodies to transforming growth factor-beta, a cytokine inhibitory of monocyte O2- production, abrogated (P less than .01) cocaine-mediated suppression, suggesting that transforming growth factor-beta is involved in the suppression. Also, naloxone blocked (P less than .01) the suppressive effects of both cocaine and transforming growth factor-beta on O2- production, suggesting that the suppressive mechanism is naloxone-sensitive.\r"

  ".W": "Early developmental exposure to diazepam (DZ) via administration of the drug to the pregnant rat (1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg) over gestational days 14 to 20 altered both behavior of adult progeny on two tests of anxiety and function of the benzodiazepine/gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex (a neural substrate of anxiety-related behavior) in a sexually dimorphic manner. Adult male rats (60-90 days) exposed in utero to DZ spent significantly more time on the open arm of the elevated plus-maze than male rats exposed to vehicle, whereas plus-maze performance in female rats was unaffected by the early drug exposure. Similarly, early exposure to DZ markedly altered environment-specific social interaction in male rats, leading to increased social interaction in the unfamiliar environment and decreased social interaction in the familiar environment. Social interaction in adult female rats is not normally environment-specific; however, female rats exposed in utero to DZ at 2.5 mg/kg demonstrated a significant effect of the novel environment on social interaction, thus responding like unmanipulated male rats. The sensitivity of GABA-mediated 36chloride uptake to GABA was enhanced in synaptoneurosomes from male rats exposed in utero to DZ at 2.5 mg/kg and early exposure to either dose of DZ prevented the facilitative effect of DZ added in vitro on GABA-mediated chloride uptake. Function of the receptor complex was not altered in female rats by early DZ exposure. Thus, perinatal insults at the molecular level may underlie gender-related behavioral disorders in the young adult.\r"

  ".W": "Large numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes which generate reactive oxygen metabolites are found in mucosa and submucosa of the intestinal wall of subjects suffering from inflammatory bowel disease. We have, therefore, examined the relative influences of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and N-chloramines such as NH2Cl, on the neurally stimulated and nonstimulated guinea pig ileum. In separate experiments the oxidants were tested in the presence and absence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor piroxicam and the antioxidant glutathione. All three oxidants, in concentrations produced by activated neutrophils, increased the muscle tone (concentration-dependent, peak at 0.3 mM for NH2Cl and H2O2 and 1 mM for HOCl). Tetrodotoxin (0.5 microM) inhibited the NH2Cl and H2O2 effects by 50% and 70%, respectively. Piroxicam (5 microM) partially blocked maximal contractions induced by all three oxidants. The contractile response to carbachol (10 microM) was blocked by 0.3 mM NH2Cl, but not by H2O2 and HOCl. In electrically stimulated ileum the oxidants produced a concentration-dependent biphasic response (transient enhancement of neurally mediated twitch contraction followed by marked inhibition). This response was not modified by piroxicam, hexamethonium, atropine and pyrilamine. The inhibition of twitch contraction was irreversible for NH2Cl and HOCl, in contrast to H2O2, which was reversed by repeated washing. Neither the contractile effect nor the effects on nerve stimulation-induced contraction were affected by preincubation of the tissue with glutathione, whereas prior combination of NH2Cl with glutathione prevented the effects of NH2Cl. Oxidant-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum appears to be via release of prostaglandins and one or more neurotransmitters. High concentrations of reactive oxygen metabolites may alter receptor function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91108710\r", 
  ".W": "These studies were conducted to gain greater understanding of the mechanism of action of the chemically novel antihypertensive agent, McN-5691. McN-5691 (1 and 10 microM) prevented 60 mM KCl-induced contraction and calcium uptake and caused concentration-dependent relaxation (EC50 = 190 microM) of 30 mM KCl-contracted aortic rings. At or below 10 microM, McN-5691 had no effects on basal tone or calcium uptake (45Ca) in isolated rings of rabbit thoracic aorta. McN-5691 caused complete high affinity inhibition (Kd = 39.5 nM) of specific diltiazem binding to the benzothiazepine receptor on the voltage-sensitive calcium channel in skeletal muscle microsomal membranes. In contrast to diltiazem, McN-5691 inhibited specific dihydropyridine receptor binding, but the effect was biphasic with high (Kd = 4.7 nM) and low (Kd = 919.8 nM) affinity components. These findings suggest that McN-5691 is a voltage-sensitive calcium channel blocker. Unlike other calcium channel blockers, McN-5691 inhibited norepinephrine (NE)-induced contraction (10 microM) and calcium uptake (1 and 10 microM) and caused concentration-dependent relaxation (EC50 = 159 microM) of 1 microM NE-contracted rings of rabbit thoracic aorta. The vascular relaxant effects of McN-5691 were not related to increased calcium (45Ca) efflux from vascular smooth muscle cells. The effects of McN-5691 on NE-induced contraction were unrelated to intracellular mechanisms because McN-5691 did not affect NE-induced contraction in the absence of extracellular calcium. McN-5691 had weak activity in rat cerebral cortical membrane alpha-1 or alpha-2 adrenergic receptor binding assays. McN-5691-induced vasodilation of phenylephrine-contracted rat aortic strips was not reversible by high potassium, indicating that McN-5691 does not induce relaxation of blood vessels through potassium channel activation. In summary, these studies suggest that the primary vasodilator mechanism of McN-5691 is calcium channel blockade through competitive binding at the diltiazem site on the voltage sensitive calcium channel. McN-5691 may possess an additional vasodilator mechanism of action distinct from alpha adrenergic receptor blockade but involving a cell membrane-related event apparently leading to attenuation of receptor-operated calcium channel activity.\r"

  ".W": "Opioid effects on the development of long-term potentiation (LTP) were investigated at the lateral perforant path (LPP)-dentate granule cell synapse of the hippocampal slice. High frequency stimuli were delivered to the outer molecular layer of the dentate to tetanize the LPP. Significant LTP was induced in the amplitude of the orthodromic population spike and the slope of the population excitatory postsynaptic potential recorded from the granule cell layer and molecular layer. Bath application of naloxone (0.1-10 microM), an opioid antagonist, induced a dose-dependent reduction in the potentiation of both orthodromic population spike and excitatory postsynaptic potential evoked in the LPP, but not in adjacent medial perforant path. PLO17 ([N-MePhe3-D-Pro4]morphiception; 0.3 or 1 microM), a mu opioid agonist, reduced the threshold for LTP and increased the amount of LTP in the LPP. PLO17 also reduced recurrent inhibition and enhanced an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated component in single pulse-evoked field potentials in the LPP. The effects of PLO17 were antagonized by 1 microM naloxone and the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (100 microM). These findings suggest that endogenous opioids released during high frequency stimulation play an important role in the induction of LTP at the LPP synapses. A mu receptor-mediated disinhibition which increases current flow through NMDA channels may contribute to the opioid enhancement of LTP in the dentate gyrus.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of cultured canine femoral artery vascular smooth muscle cells to serotonin (5-HT) caused a 3.6-fold stimulation of ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake. The 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin, partly blocked the 5-HT-mediated Na+/K+ pump stimulation and the 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist, methiothepin, completely blocked the response, suggesting that both 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors play a role in the 5-HT-mediated Na+/K+ pump activation. Second messengers generated by 5-HT2 receptor-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, Ins(1,4,5)P3 and diacylglycerol were implicated in the stimulatory action of 5-HT on the vascular Na+/K+ pump. Like some other contractile agonists, 5-HT activated a Na+ influx pathway which caused Na+/K+ pump stimulation by increasing the rate-limiting substrate. The maximum stimulation of Na+ influx by 5-HT was 2.5-fold. The 5-HT-stimulated Na+ influx was totally blocked by methiothepin but only 29% inhibited by ketanserin, indicating that most of the Na+ influx was mediated by the 5-HT1 receptor. The 5-HT-stimulated Na+ influx was substantially inhibited by 50 microM dimethylamiloride, suggesting that the Na+ influx pathway stimulated by 5-HT was Na+/H+ exchange. BAPTA/AM 1,2-[bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, tetra (acetoxymethyl) ester], an intracellular Ca++ chelator, partly blocked 5-HT-stimulated Na+ influx and ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake, suggesting that Ca++ is an important mediator of these responses. These data suggest that: 1) 5-HT, in addition to its well known activity as a contractile agonist, can stimulate the electrogenic Na+/K+ pump which, in theory, would tend to oppose contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was designed to further investigate the possible role of phosphoinositide turnover in mediating the biphasic effect of Ang II. Rat PCT was perfused in vivo with Ringer's solution containing [3H]inulin as a volume marker. Bicarbonate flux (JHCO3) was determined by total CO2 changes between the collected fluid and the original perfusate as analyzed by microcalorimetry. Luminal perfusion with 10(-11) M Ang II or 10(-8) M 4-beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate stimulated both fluid reabsorption (JV) and JHCO3, these effects can be blocked by 2 x 10(-4) M 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8), a blocker of intracellular calcium mobilization. Interestingly, Ang II at 10(-9) M or 2 x 10(-4) M TMB-8 have no effect on JV or JHCO3 individually. However, JV and JHCO3 significantly decreased when PCT were perfused simultaneously with 10(-9) M Ang II and 10(-4) M 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine; whereas JV and JHCO3 significantly increased when PCT were perfused with 10(-9) M Ang II and 2 x 10(-4) M TMB-8 together. These results suggest that PKC and intracellular calcium play a critical role in mediating the biphasic effect of Ang II on bicarbonate and sodium transport in PCT.\r"

UK-68,798 (5 nM-1 microM) increased the effective refractory period of isolated guinea pig papillary muscles at stimulation frequencies of 1 Hz and 5 Hz without influencing the conduction velocity, further confirming that UK-68,798 is devoid of class I antiarrhythmic activity including block of the sodium channel. Studies using single voltage clamped guinea pig ventricular myocytes indicated that UK-68,798 at concentrations of 50 nM and 2 microM blocks a time-dependent K+ current, with no appreciable effects on the time-independent K+ current or the inward calcium current.

The present study was performed to evaluate the antiarrhythmic efficacy of UK-68,798 (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) in dogs with a previous myocardial infarction. UK-68,798 did not alter the PQ interval or QRS duration of the surface electrocardiogram but did increase the Q-Tc interval significantly. The ventricular ERP was increased significantly (P less than .01) at a basic cycle length of stimulation of either 300 ms (ERP increased 24 +/- 10 ms) or 250 ms (ERP increased 20 +/- 12 msec), indicating that the response was preserved at more rapid rates. UK-68,798 prevented the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in six of seven animals (86%, P = .03). However, UK-68,798 failed to prevent the induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in dogs where VF was the only arrhythmia induced. To evaluate the mechanisms responsible for the prevention of ventricular tachycardia and lack of efficacy against inducible VF, detailed three-dimensional activation mapping of the heart in vivo was used. Induction of ventricular tachycardia was prevented by UK-68,798 due to a lengthening of the ERP in the epicardial region surrounding the infarct with no effect on conduction velocity even in periinfarct regions bordering the infarct. In contrast, the induction of VF was dependent on a rapid nonreentrant or focal mechanism that was not altered by the lengthening of ERP with UK-68,798. Thus, UK-68,798 is a selective class III antiarrhythmic agent that is likely to be efficacious in preventing arrhythmias due to a reentrant mechanism in patients with a previous myocardial infarction.\r"

Changing the carboxy terminus from Cys6-Pro7-Arg8-NH2 in SK&F 101926 to Cys6-Arg7-NH2 or to D-Cys6-Pro7-Arg8-NH2 or to D- or L-Cys6-Arg7-D-Arg8-NH2 reduced antidiuretic agonist and increased water diuretic activity. Replacement of the sulfur atoms in the cysteine residues with methylene groups further reduced the antidiuretic agonist activity of all carboxy terminus-modified compounds which possessed full agonist activity. It also increased the water diuretic activity of those disulfide analogs with both weak agonist and antagonist activity. These results indicate that alterations in the geometry of the hexapeptide ring and in the stereochemical relationship between the ring and the carboxy terminus of the molecule substantially modify the in vivo agonist and antagonist activity of vasopressin analogs.\r"

  ".U": "91108719\r", 
  ".W": "Ca+(+)-dependent release of endogenous norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine from superfused rat hypothalamic slices was stimulated by 40 mM K+. 20 mM K+ released only NE. Two consecutive exposures to 20 mM K+ (S1 and S2, respectively) produced NE release of similar magnitude (S2/S1 = 1.03 +/- 0.08). Serotonin (5-HT), 3 to 10 microM, in the presence of methylsergide or ritanserin (antagonists at 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2 receptors), caused a concentration-dependent decrease of K(+)-evoked NE release. 5-HT alone did not alter K(+)-evoked NE release. 2-Methyl-serotonin, 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, 3 to 10 microM (a selective 5-HT3 agonist), mimicked the 5-HT response in the presence and in the absence of ritanserin. A highly selective 5-HT3 antagonist, (3 alpha-tropanyl)1H-indole-3-carboxylic acid ester (ICS 205-930), 1 nM, inhibited the effect of both agonists. The isomers of another highly selective 5-HT3 antagonist, zacopride, inhibited the effect of 2-methyl-serotonin, 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, at a concentration range, 0.03 to 20 nM, characteristic of their interaction with 5-HT3 receptors. alpha-Methyl-serotonin, alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, a selective 5-HT1-like/5-HT2 agonist, failed to affect the K(+)-evoked NE release, but antagonized the effect of 2-methyl-serotonin, 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine. These observations provide direct evidence that, in rat hypothalamus, 5-HT modulates release of endogenous NE through activation of 5-HT3 and, possibly, 5-HT1C receptors.\r"

Chronic HAL (2 mg/kg/day x 21 days in drinking water) decreased basal DA release and metabolism in both regions, and produced tolerance to HAL-induced increase in DA metabolism in striatum. No modification of HAL-induced increases in DA release and metabolism were observed in accumbens. Together with D2 receptor blockade, this may produce decreased dopaminergic neurotransmission in both regions during chronic treatment. Chronic HAL (0.5 mg/kg/day x 21 days in drinking water) also decreased basal DA release and metabolism in both regions which were not reversed by 25 micrograms/kg of (-)-apomorphine, s.c. In marked contrast, chronic CLOZ (20 mg/kg/day x 21 days in drinking water) had no effect on basal DA release and metabolism in either region, whereas it produced tolerance to CLOZ-induced increase in DA release and metabolism in accumbens. Together with weak D2 receptor blockade, this may lead to slightly decreased dopaminergic neurotransmission in accumbens and slightly increased dopaminergic neurotransmission in striatum during chronic CLOZ treatment. These differences may contribute to the clinical differences between the two agents.\r"

  ".U": "91108722\r", 
  ".W": "In the treatment of various dermatological disorders, topically applied retinoids have potential therapeutic use with the advantage of improved localized activity and lower toxicity over systemically administered retinoids. However, most retinoids cause a significant degree of local irritation. In the present study, the ability to produce local activity with low local irritation potential was evaluated with a novel retinoic acid derivative. BMY 30047 (11-cis, 13-cis-12-hydroxymethylretinoic acid delta-lactone) is one of a series of retinoic acid derivatives in which the carboxyl function of the polar end was modified with the aim of achieving reduced local irritation and systemic toxicity while retaining the local therapeutic effect. BMY 30047 was evaluated and compared with all-trans retinoic acid for topical retinoid activity in several preclinical assay systems, including the utricle reduction assay in rhino mice, 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ester-stimulated ornithine decarboxylase induction in hairless mice and the UV light-induced photodamaged skin model in hairless mice. BMY 30047 was assessed for retinoid-type side effects by evaluating the skin irritation potential in rabbits after repeated topical application, and hypervitaminosis A-inducing potential in mice after i.p. injection. BMY 30047 demonstrated significant topical retinoid activity in several in vivo models with less skin irritation potential relative to the most used clinical concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid. BMY 30047 also showed very little systemic activity and did not produce any evidence of hypervitaminosis A syndrome at systemic doses 20 times greater than the no-effect dose of all-trans retinoic acid.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the interrelationship of delayed amnesia, delayed neuronal death and changes in acetylcholine concentration induced by carbon monoxide (CO)-exposure in mice. In the test for retention of the passive avoidance task, amnesia was observed 5 and 7 days after CO-exposure when the mice were exposed to CO 1 day after training; in the case when the mice were exposed to CO 5 and 7 days before training, amnesia was also observed in a retention test given 1 day after training. The number of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 subfield was lower than that of the control 3, 5 and 7 days after CO-exposure. But the neurodegeneration in the parietal cortex, area 1, was not observed until 7 days after CO-exposure. The findings indicated that the amnesia and the neuronal death were produced after a delay when the mice were exposed to CO. In addition, the delayed amnesia was closely related to the delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 subfield. Moreover, [3H]glutamate and [3H]glycine binding sites did not change after CO-exposure but, 7 days after CO-exposure, the concentration of acetylcholine and the binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in the frontal cortex and the striatum were found to have significantly changed, but those in the hippocampus did not show significant change. Therefore, we suggest that delayed amnesia induced by CO-exposure may result from delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 subfield and dysfunction in the acetylcholinergic neurons, in the frontal cortex, the striatum and/or the hippocampus.\r"

  ".W": "Oxytocin, bradykinin, melittin and A23187 increased cyclic GMP levels through activation of soluble guanylate cyclase in cultured porcine kidney epithelial cells, LLC-PK1. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, an inhibitor of endothelium-derived relaxing factor/nitric oxide formation, decreased both basal and stimulated levels of cyclic GMP in a concentration-dependent manner. L-Arginine, but not D-arginine, augmented basal as well as stimulated levels of cyclic GMP and prevented the inhibition induced by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Similar effects of L-arginine were also observed with L-argininamide, L-arginine ethyl ester, L-arginine methyl ester and the dipeptide L-arginyl-L-aspartic acid. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine did not affect cyclic GMP accumulation induced by sodium nitroprusside, an activator of soluble guanylate cyclase, and atrial natriuretic factor, an activator of particulate guanylate cyclase. Stimulatory effects of oxytocin, glyceryl trinitrate, sodium nitroprusside, bradykinin, melittin and A23187 on cyclic GMP accumulation were enhanced with superoxide dismutase and diminished with oxyhemoglobin. However, atrial natriuretic factor-induced cyclic GMP accumulation was not affected. Furthermore, endothelium derived relaxing factor-like activity was detected in the conditioned medium from LLC-PK1 cells stimulated with oxytocin. Based on these data, we conclude that endothelium-derived relaxing factor is produced in this cell type and participates in the regulatory mechanism of cyclic GMP formation as an intra- and intercellular messenger for activation of soluble guanylate cyclase.\r"

To investigate the role of circulating reactive metabolites in lung injury, the stability, metabolism and cytotoxicity of naphthalene oxide, a reactive intermediate, were examined in the perfused mouse lung. The T1/2 of naphthalene oxide is 4 min in Waymouth's medium. Addition of 5% bovine serum albumin to the medium increased the half-life of the epoxide to 11 min. Perfusion of the lung with 0.2 or 2 mumol of naphthalene oxide decreased pulmonary reduced glutathione levels to 62 and 42% of control, respectively. 1,4-Naphthoquinone and naphthol-glucuronide represented 36 and 25% of the total polar metabolites isolated after infusion of naphthalene oxide, whereas dihydrodiol and thioether conjugates were minor metabolites. In comparison, thioethers and dihydrodiol were the primary metabolites isolated from lungs perfused with [14C]naphthalene. Histologic examination of the lungs fixed 4 hr after infusion of naphthalene oxide (0.25-1.0 mumol/60 min) revealed selective vacuolation and necrosis of Clara cells, significant decreases in the mass of bronchiolar Clara cells and increases in the mass of vacuolated cells. Injury to lungs perfused with naphthalene or secondary metabolites such as naphthoquinones, 1-naphthol and 1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene was less dramatic. In contrast to other studies implicating quinones as mediators of aromatic hydrocarbon toxicity, the current work suggests that epoxides play a significant role in naphthalene-induced lung injury. This investigation also demonstrates that circulating epoxides are capable of eliciting selective Clara cell injury.\r"

Under the conditions studied, millimolar concentrations of quisqualate, (RS)-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid, glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartate did not cause significant cytolysis. In contrast, KA induced complete cell death, which was antagonized by 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, quisqualate, (RS)-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid and glutamate. This neurotoxic effect was dependent on the dose of KA and the age of the cultures. Two separate components of KA-induced neurotoxicity were observed and differentiated according to morphological changes, time of onset and ionic dependence. For acute neurotoxicity, release of lactate dehydrogenase measured after 30 min of KA exposure, became apparent between 8 and 11 days in culture and was dependent on both Cl- and Na+. However, vulnerability to acute toxicity did not correlate with [3H]KA receptor expression with receptor-mediated Cl- influx. On the other hand, delayed toxicity, as determined by lactate dehydrogenase release 24 hr after KA exposure, was dependent on Cl-. This delayed neurotoxicity induced by KA shares time course features with N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated toxicity. Yet in contrast to studies reported for N-methyl-D-aspartate, glutamate was ineffective as an agonist, measured by its ability to elicit a neurotoxic response, and the KA delayed response did not appear to be dependent upon the presence of extracellular Ca++, during the exposure to KA.\r"

Neutrophils (PMNs) infiltrate periportal regions of the liver after ANIT intoxication. Because PMNs play a causal role in other extrahepatic models of tissue injury, we determined whether PMNs might be involved in ANIT-induced liver injury in rats by reducing circulating PMN numbers with a polyclonal antibody (antineutrophil serum). ANIT treatment caused cholestasis and elevations in serum of total bilirubin concentration, total bile acid concentration, aspartate amino-transferase activity, gamma-glutamyltransferase activity and histologic lesions consistent with acute, neutrophilic cholangiohepatitis. Cotreatment of rats with antineutrophil serum reduced circulating PMN numbers, prevented ANIT-induced cholestasis and attenuated other markers of liver injury elevated by ANIT. In addition, antineutrophil serum treatment attenuated the severity of histologic lesions within the liver and reduced the number of PMNs in periportal regions. Numbers of PMNs in liver sections correlated positively with markers of liver injury, histologic evidence of cholangiohepatitis and numbers of circulating PMNs in peripheral blood. The protection afforded by antineutrophil serum appeared to result from a specific reduction of PMNs and not lymphocytes, because administration of an antilymphocyte serum reduced circulating lymphocyte numbers without offering protection. Inasmuch as ANIT stimulates PMNs in vitro to release O2- and since PMN-derived oxygen species may cause tissue injury, we determined whether administration of agents which degrade oxygen radicals afforded protection against the liver injury caused by ANIT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The (-)-isomer and the (+)-isomer of CH-38083 ([7,8-(methylenedioxy)-14- alpha-hydroxyalloberbane HCl), a selective alpha-2-adrenoceptor antagonist with an alloberbane skeleton, increased the electrically induced release of [3H]NE in a concentration-dependent manner, and a similar effect was observed with racemic CH-38083 and idazoxan. The stereoisomers of CH-38083 applied in a concentration range of 10(-8) to 10(-6) mol/l were equipotent in facilitating stimulation-evoked [3H]NE release: concentrations needed to enhance tritium outflow by 50% were 1.3 X 10(-7) mol/l for (-)-CH-38083 and 1.4 X 10(-7) mol/l for (+)-CH-38083. Exogenous NE decreased the electrically stimulated release of [3H]NE, and the stereoisomers of CH-38083 antagonized this inhibition with different potencies: the dissociation constant (KB) values for (-)-isomer and for (+)-isomer of CH-38083 were 14.29 and 97.18 nmol/l. These data indicate that presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors that are available for NE released from axon terminals do not show stereospecificity toward enantiomers of CH-38083, whereas those that are occupied by exogenous NE are much more sensitive toward (-)-CH-38083. The alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin also differentiated between the alpha-2 adrenoceptor subtypes: prazosin (10(-6) mol/l) did not alter the increase of electrically induced [3H]NE release evoked by (-)- and (+)-CH-38083; however, in its presence, the stereoisomers of CH-38083 failed to antagonize the inhibitory effect of exogenous NE on its own release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study examines the role of endogenous adenosine in the regulation of renin in humans. The ability of the adenosine receptor blocker, caffeine, to augment renin release in response to the vasodilator, diazoxide, has been investigated in eight normal subjects in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. During each arm of the study, subjects on a 150 mEq of sodium, xanthine-free diet received caffeine (250 mg 3 times daily) or placebo for 3 days before and on the study day, when they were given an i.v. loading dose of diazoxide (4 mg/kg) followed by a 3-hr continuous infusion (0.67 mg/kg/hour). PRA, caffeine and diazoxide levels were measured before, during and after the diazoxide infusion. PRA measurements were repeated with subjects standing, 6 hr after starting diazoxide. Administration of diazoxide resulted in a modest tachycardia and a small, but significant, decrease in BP. Supine PRA was elevated during and after the diazoxide infusion and rose further with standing. Although there was no difference in plasma diazoxide levels, maximal pulse or BP response to diazoxide between the two arms of the study, the renin response was significantly greater in the presence of caffeine. These data confirm that caffeine augments the PRA response to diazoxide and suggest that endogenous adenosine inhibits stimulated renin response in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Caffeine is a competitive antagonist at adenosine receptors. Receptor up-regulation during chronic drug treatment has been proposed to be the mechanism of tolerance to the behavioral stimulant effects of caffeine. This study reassessed the role of adenosine receptors in caffeine tolerance. Separate groups of rats were given scheduled access to drinking bottles containing plain tap water or a 0.1% solution of caffeine. Daily drug intake averaged 60-75 mg/kg and resulted in complete tolerance to caffeine-induced stimulation of locomotor activity, which could not be surmounted by increasing the dose of caffeine. 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (0.001-1.0 mg/kg) dose dependently decreased the locomotor activity of caffeine-tolerant rats and their water-treated controls but was 8-fold more potent in the latter group. Caffeine (1.0-10 mg/kg) injected concurrently with 5-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine antagonized the decreases in locomotor activity comparably in both groups. Apparent pA2 values for tolerant and control rats also were comparable: 5.05 and 5.11. Thus, the adenosine-antagonist activity of caffeine was undiminished in tolerant rats. The effects of chronic caffeine administration on parameters of adenosine receptor binding and function were measured in cerebral cortex. There were no differences between brain tissue from control and caffeine-treated rats in number and affinity of adenosine binding sites or in receptor-mediated increases (A2 adenosine receptor) and decreases (A1 adenosine receptor) in cAMP accumulation. These results are consistent with theoretical arguments that changes in receptor density should not affect the potency of a competitive antagonist. Experimental evidence and theoretical considerations indicate that up-regulation of adenosine receptors is not the mechanism of tolerance to caffeine-induced stimulation of locomotor activity.\r"

  ".W": "Drug concentrations in the lymph of the hindquarters of sheep were used to gain insight into drug disposition within the interstitial space. Lidocaine, procainamide and meperidine were each infused into the right atrium of adult merino ewes for 220 min. The time courses of drug concentrations in arterial and inferior vena caval (IVC, draining the hindquarters) blood and hindquarter lymph were determined. It was found that in unanesthetized sheep the mean (+/- S.D., n = 3) lidocaine, procainamide and meperidine concentrations in the hindquarter lymph, were 74 +/- 11, 107 +/- 25 and 94 +/- 17%, respectively, of the arterial and 92 +/- 15, 113 +/- 27 and 134 +/- 28%, respectively, of the IVC blood drug concentrations. Drug binding in lymph, determined by equilibrium dialysis, was not significantly higher than that in blood, except for lidocaine at an initial buffer concentration of 5 micrograms/ml. When the studies were repeated with different animals under halothane anesthesia, the lymph/arterial and lymph/IVC blood drug concentration ratios of the three drugs decreased to 66 +/- 9, 73 +/- 13 and 71 +/- 13% and 77 +/- 8, 88 +/- 19 and 85 +/- 10%, respectively. These values were all significantly lower than those in unanesthetized animals. The results suggest that drug protein binding in interstitial fluid and the status of the microcirculation are important determinants of drug distribution in the interstitial and intracellular spaces. The data also confirm the assumption made in pharmacokinetic studies based upon mass balance principles that the rate of drug removal from organs by lymph is negligible.\r"

We examined the sites of action of analgesia induced by systemic application of E-2078 compared with morphine in mice. When administered either intracerebroventricularly or intrathecally, E-2078 produced maximal dose-dependent analgesia in the tail-pinch, tail-flick and formalin tests. Its peak effect was observed 15 min after both injections, contrasted with a slow peak (120 min) by subcutaneous injection. The intrathecal site was relatively more sensitive than the intracerebroventricular site and many times more sensitive than the subcutaneous route. In contrast, morphine was equipotent when given intracerebroventricularly and intrathecally. When E-2078 was administered subcutaneously and naloxone or nor-binaltorphine were given either intracerebroventricularly or intrathecally, the analgesic action of E-2078 was most potently and totally reversed by intrathecal injection of nor-binaltorphimine. Intracerebroventricular and intrathecal injections of naloxone were equally effective for antagonism of morphine-analgesia. These data indicate that systemically administered E-2078 produces analgesia via central actions, in which the activation of the spinal kappa receptors is most important.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) with sympathetic transmission was investigated in the guinea pig inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and ganglion (IMG). Intracellular recordings of membrane potential were made using glass microelectrodes. Superfusion of 5-HT (0.3 microM) reduced the amplitudes of stimulation-evoked excitatory junction potentials in the IMA. 5-HT had no effect on depolarizing responses to pressure-ejection of adenosine triphosphate or norepinephrine in the IMA. The inhibitory effect of 5-HT on excitatory junction potentials in the IMA was abolished by methysergide (3 microM), but was unaffected by the following antagonists: methiothepin (1 microM), MDL 72222 (3 microM), MDL 11939 (0.3 microM) or by phentolamine (10 microM). In the IMG, pressure-ejection of 5-HT (10 mM) evoked fast and slow depolarizing responses in 77% of neurons tested; the fast depolarizing responses to 5-HT were reduced in the presence of MDL 72222 (5 microM). Superfusion of 5-HT (0.3-3 microM) had no effect on stimulation-evoked fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the IMG. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that, depending on its site of interaction with postganglionic sympathetic neurons, 5-HT may have excitatory or inhibitory effects on sympathetic transmission. 5-HT may inhibit transmitter release through the activation of as yet unidentified 5-HT receptors on the sympathetic nerve endings in mesenteric blood vessels. Whereas, in the prevertebral ganglion, 5-HT may act to facilitate sympathetic transmission, in part, through activation of 5-HT3, receptors on the somata of principal neurons.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the release of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SRIF-LI) was studied in synaptosomes prepared from rat cerebral cortex and exposed in superfusion to the amino acid. GABA (1-300 microM) increased the spontaneous outflow of SRIF-LI in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of GABA was not prevented by the GABAA receptor antagonists bicuculline or picrotoxin. The GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (10-100 microM) did not affect SRIF-LI release. Similarly ineffective was the GABAB receptor agonist (-)-baclofen (100 microM). The GABA-induced SRIF-LI release was counteracted by the GABA uptake inhibitors N-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-nipecotic acid (SK&F 89976A) and nipecotic acid. When used as a GABA carrier substrate, nipecotic acid mimicked GABA and increased SRIF-LI release; its effect was antagonized by SK&F 89976A. The mechanism involved appears to be selective for GABA inasmuch as neutral amino acids such as leucine, alpha-aminobutyric acid or valine, tested at 100 microM, had little or no effect on the release of SRIF-LI. Neither GABA (100 microM) nor nipecotic acid (300 microM) enhanced the release of cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity. The GABA-evoked somatostatin release was calcium-dependent and tetrodotoxin-insensitive. It is concluded that a carrier for the uptake of GABA exists on somatostatin-releasing terminals of rat cerebral cortex and that GABA uptake may regulate somatostatin release. This conclusion would be compatible with the reported coexistence of GABA and somatostatin in cerebrocortical neurons.\r"

LY233569 also inhibited (IC50 approximately 1.8 microM) zymosan-stimulated production of leukotriene B4 in canine whole blood but had little or no concomitant effect on the production of thromboxane B2. Concentrations of LY233569 as high as 10 microM did not inhibit production or scavenge superoxide from activated human neutrophils. In normal anesthetized dogs, infusion of LY233569 (0.11 mg/kg/min, i.v.) for 6 hr produced persistent inhibition (approximately 80%) of leukotriene B4 production in blood challenged ex vivo with zymosan; the plasma concentration (approximately 4 microM) of LY233569 was consistent with in vitro data illustrating selective and maximal inhibition of 5-LPO. In subsequent experiments, myocardial infarct size was measured after 1 hr of occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery and 5 hr of reperfusion. Continuous infusion of LY233569 (0.11 mg/kg/min, i.v.) had little or no effect on base-line systolic arterial pressure, cardiac rate and the pressure rate product when compared with time-related changes observed in control dogs. LY233569 infusion also did not alter the degree of ST-segment deviation or the intensity and duration of cardiac arrhythmias associated with coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Resultant myocardial infarct sizes were 45 +/- 5% of the left ventricle placed at risk in control dogs and 43 +/- 4% in dogs given LY233569. Myeloperoxidase activity of infarcted myocardium did not differ between groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anti-E11 and anti-E3 antibody levels were significantly elevated in RA sera, compared with both RF negative and RF positive nonrheumatoid controls. The concentrations of anti-E11 and anti-E3 antibodies in the preillness sera were lower than those in RA sera. Eight-year followup samples of patients with RA had slightly decreased levels of anti-E3 and anti-E11 antibodies compared with samples taken within 6 months of the disease onset. Anti-p62 antibody levels did not differ significantly between any of the groups studied. Thus, elevated levels of antibodies to 2 of the glycine containing EBNA-1 peptides were associated with clinical RA.\r"

However, the presence of antibodies reacting with a variety of other self antigens, including antimitochondrial antibodies, has often been reported although their significance is unknown. Moreover, patients with Sjogren's syndrome have been occasionally reported to be concordant with primary biliary cirrhosis. To address this issue we studied in a group of 96 patients with Sjogren's syndrome the presence of autoantibodies to the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferases of both pyruvate dehydrogenase and branch chain ketoacid dehydrogenase and to alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; these latter enzymes are the mitochondrial target antigens of primary biliary cirrhosis. We report that 7 of the 96 patients reacted with the mitochondrial antigens that are prominent in primary biliary cirrhosis. Moreover, in those patients showing reactivity with mitochondrial antigens, the autoantibodies were directed at the same immunodominant epitopes that have been previously characterized in primary biliary cirrhosis. One of the 7 positive patients was known to have primary biliary cirrhosis. We hypothesize that the remaining 6 patients are at clinical risk for the development of primary biliary cirrhosis and/or that abnormalities would be found on liver biopsy.\r"

The NSAID studied included tolmetin, indomethacin, naproxen, and aspirin. Six patients were treated with multiple NSAID. The mean MTX elimination half-life was prolonged when NSAID were coadministered (1.7 +/- 0.5 vs 1.2 +/- 0.1 h; p = 0.03). However, neither the apparent MTX clearance (CI) (10.6 +/- 5.5 vs 13.1 +/- 3.5 l/h; p = 0.19), the area under the serum MTX concentration-time curve (Auc) (2.1 +/- 1.0 vs 1.5 +/- 0.6 mumol/l/h; p = 0.08) or the apparent volume of distribution (Vd) (23.0 +/- 6.2 vs 21.9 +/- 6.4 l; p = 0.53) was significantly altered by the administration of NSAID. Although the differences between the mean Cl and Auc were not statistically significant, a wide variation in the impact of NSAID on MTX Cl was observed. In 6 of 7 patients, the Auc increased during NSAID administration from 19 to 140%. This degree of increase may be clinically significant in some individuals. It is consequently recommended to closely monitor patients who are receiving MTX and NSAID for MTX toxicity until these results can be verified in a larger population.\r"

Also, if stenosis affects only vascular structures, compression of these structures cannot be noted during myelography, so venous stasis may be overlooked.

The effectiveness of sulfasalazine in AS still lacks strong evidence, as well, the magnitude of its benefit is unknown. A meta-analysis was carried out to assess the effectiveness of sulfasalazine in AS. A search of the literature was done using Medline, Index Medicus, the reference lists of articles located and contacting content experts to reveal unpublished studies. Five randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing sulfasalazine to placebo were located and assessed methodologically. The methodologic quality of all 5 RCT was considered satisfactory and consequently these studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of clinical benefit (and its 95% confidence interval) favoring sulfasalazine, over and above that observed in the placebo group was as follows: Duration of morning stiffness -28.2% (-54.6 to -1.8%); severity of morning stiffness -30.6% (-52.5 to -8.7%); severity of pain -26.7% (-44.3 to -9.1%); general well being -7.1% (-24.3 to 10.0%); erythrocyte sedimentation rate -9.2% (-24.8 to 6.4%); and IgA -11.7% (-18.8 to -4.7%). Adverse effects, mostly mild, were more frequently observed in the sulfasalazine group (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5746, p = 0.1082). The occurrence of dropouts (OR = 1.1554, p = 0.6119) was similar in both groups. Sulfasalazine is a safe and effective drug in the short term treatment of AS.\r"

A subtype of DR7, DR7a, was found in 38.8% of patients with PsA, 41.5% of patients with Ps, and in 8% of healthy individuals (N) (PsA vs N: pc = 0.0002, RR = 7.1; Ps vs N: pc = 0.0002, RR = 7.9). No association with TcR genes was found.

In 10 patients treated by sulfasalazine (Salazopyrine), pathologic lesions disappeared simultaneously with an improvement of the rheumatic conditions. comparison between patients treated and untreated with nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAID) demonstrated that NSAID did not enter into the etiopathology of the intestinal lesions. Our study therefore confirms the high incidence of inflammatory gut lesions among patients with spondylarthropathy which seems not to be related to NSAID therapy.\r"

Diagram ratings were compared with nerve conduction diagnoses in 110 patients with upper extremity complaints. A hand diagram rating of classic or probable CTS had sensitivity of 0.64, specificity of 0.73 and positive predictive value of 0.58. The negative predictive value of an unlikely diagram was 0.91. We conclude that the diagram is a useful diagnostic tool and may be valuable for occupational and population screening.\r"

Computed tomography (CT) can differentiate earlier than plain radiography between the 2 conditions; furthermore, it should also be possible to make this differentiation clinically. The aim of our study was to verify whether the criteria recently proposed by the European Spondylarthropathy Study Group (EESG) for the classification of spondyloarthropathy are useful. CT scans through the synovial part of the sacroiliac joints of 7 consecutive patients meeting the ESSG criteria and showing typical findings of osteitis condensans ilii on plain films were mixed with those of 15 consecutive patients with osteitis condensans ilii not meeting the ESSG criteria. Scans were examined for joint space and surface abnormalities blindly and independently by 2 observers. Six patients in the spondyloarthropathy group and one in the osteiitis condensans ilii group showed clear erosions and/or joint space narrowing of less than 2 mm in at least one joint. The difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Our results suggest that by using criteria valid for the whole group of seronegative spondyloarthropathies, it is possible to differentiate clinically between seronegative spondyloarthropathies with sacroiliitis mimicking osteitis condensans ilii and \"true\" osteitis condensans ilii.\r"

In all 4 patients, CIC levels significantly decreased after administration of PGE1 by continuous infusion at 10/ng/kg/min via central venous catheter for 72 h. In addition, the skin ulcer in a patient with PSS healed completely, and the finger necrosis in a patient with RA improved. These results suggest that PGE1 given by continuous venous infusion is effective in reducing CIC, in addition to improving peripheral vascular disorders.\r"

On biopsy fascial inflammation was always seen consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes and eosinophils in a perivascular distribution. Invasion of the vascular wall by lymphocytes was seen in 20%. Capillary and arteriolar endothelial cell thickening was found in most cases on electron microscopy and endothelial cell necrosis or mural invasion by lymphocytes was seen in 25% of cases.

  ".W": "Aside from its more conventional uses as a cardiovascular drug, the calcium channel blocker verapamil has recently been added to chemotherapeutic regimens to reduce drug resistance in B-cell and other neoplasms that express the P-glycoprotein. We recently treated patients with continuous-infusion verapamil (0.15 mg/kg per hour to 0.60 mg/kg per hour) over a 5-day period in combination with continuous-infusion vincristine and doxorubicin plus oral dexamethasone. Seventy-one courses involving 35 hospitalized patients were prospectively studied for cardiovascular and other side effects. Cardiovascular side effects were observed most frequently and consisted of first-degree heart block, hypotension, sinus bradycardia, and junctional rhythms. We observed higher degree heart block, but the QRS interval remained narrow and the ventricular escape rate remained relatively normal. Effects on mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and PR interval were both time and dose related. Severe, symptomatic congestive heart failure was rarely observed. The most common noncardiovascular side effects were constipation, peripheral edema, and weight gain. All systemic toxic effects observed were easily treated or disappeared with either temporary or permanent discontinuation of the verapamil infusion or by a decrease in the dose of verapamil. We conclude that the cardiovascular side effects associated with continuous, high-dose intravenous verapamil therapy are significant and dose limiting but are rapidly reversible. Less cardiotoxic chemosensitizers are needed to reverse multidrug resistance in cancer.\r"

  ".W": "In 20 women with breast carcinoma, 17 of whom had locally advanced cancer and 3 of whom had confirmed metastases, the expression of P-glycoprotein was evaluated before the start of a chemotherapy regimen that included multidrug resistance-related drugs. With the use of the C494 monoclonal antibody in an avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique, P-glycoprotein was detected in 17 of 20 tumor samples. Results were expressed in a semiquantitative manner, taking into account the number of positive tumor cells (N index) and the specific staining intensity (I index). The 17 patients with nonmetastatic cancer were followed from the first cycle of chemotherapy to cancer recurrence; subsequent to six cycles of chemotherapy, all of these patients except one were rendered clinically disease-free through surgery and/or radiation. The end point was defined as either local/regional recurrence or metastasis. Strong P-glycoprotein-positive staining in a majority of tumor cells (the N+/I+ phenotype) was significantly correlated with no initial response to chemotherapy (P less than .02) and with a shorter progression-free survival (P less than .02). Thus, the pretreatment evaluation of P-glycoprotein expression may be of prognostic value in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.\r"

Enhancement characteristics were observed over a broad range of low-level direct currents (approximately 0.1 to 10 microA).

Intravenous administration of 1 microgram of human recombinant IL-1 beta given 1 hour before tumor cell injection augmented lung colony formation (experimental metastases) by the human A375 melanoma variants, the human HT-29M colon carcinoma, the SN12-K1 renal carcinoma in nude mice, the murine B16 melanoma variants, and the murine UV-2237M fibrosarcoma in syngeneic recipients. The same treatment did not induce lung colony formation by a human rectal carcinoma (HCC-P2988) or by a murine reticulum cell sarcoma (M5076), both of which are not metastatic to the lung. Spontaneous metastases were studied in C57BL/6 mice bearing the B16-BL6 melanoma (metastatic to the lung) in their footpad and the M5076 reticulum cell sarcoma (metastatic to the liver) subcutaneously. Daily intraperitoneal treatment with 1 microgram of IL-1 beta increased lung and liver metastases. These findings indicate that treatment of mice with IL-1 beta can increase the number of artificial or spontaneous metastases and that this effect is not limited to a single tumor type or to a specific organ.\r"

Thirty-eight patients (30 men and 8 women) were treated once a week for 4 weeks every 5 weeks with doses of flavone acetic acid ranging from 0.33 to 12.5 g/m2. At doses less than or equal to 3.9 g/m2, the drug was administered intravenously over 1 hour; at doses greater than or equal to 5.28 g/m2, the infusion period was lengthened to 6 hours. Treatment of all patients included hydration before and after treatment and alkalization to maintain urine pH at greater than or equal to 6.5. A dose-limiting toxic effect was hypotension at 10 g/m2. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed linear behavior in the eight patients studied, beginning at 3.9 g/m2. Peak plasma levels ranged from 125 to 630 micrograms/mL, with a mean terminal half-life of 22.4 hours. Immunologic monitoring was performed in three patients at 10 g/m2. A transient increase in CD16- and/or Leu-19-positive cells was noted in all three patients. In one patient, this increase correlated with a 10-fold increase in K562 cell killing. There were no objective tumor responses seen in this trial. The recommended phase II dose on this schedule is 8 g/m2. Further studies to elucidate the drug's mechanism of action and to define its immunologic properties are recommended.\r"

Until recently, the only tumorigenic mutations that have been studied in detail are those that activate oncogenes. The discovery of tumor suppressor genes, for which inactivating mutations elicit tumorigenesis, has added a new dimension to our understanding of neoplasia. The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene RB is the prototype tumor suppressor gene and has been shown to suppress the transformed phenotype for several different cancers. Additional studies have revealed other tumor suppressor genes that may operate in a variety of tissues through a variety of mechanisms. These mechanisms may regulate the choice between cellular proliferation and differentiation and appear to involve such processes as the initiation of DNA replication, regulation of expression of certain genes, intercellular communication and adhesion, and the transduction of external signals to intracellular effectors. The elucidation of these mechanisms will enhance our understanding of both oncogenesis and the fundamental operations of the cell.\r"

  ".U": "91108838\r", 
  ".W": "Murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) 225 (IgG1) against the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor competitively blocks EGF binding and inhibits EGF-induced activation of receptor tyrosine kinase and cell proliferation. The effect of MAb 225 was studied in a phase I trial in patients with inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, which invariably expresses high levels of EGF receptors. Groups of three patients received total doses of MAb 225 ranging from 1 mg to 300 mg. Except at the lowest dose, each infusion included 4 mg of indium 111 (111In)-labeled MAb 225. No toxicity was observed. Tumors were imaged in all patients who received doses of 20 mg or greater. Presumed metastases greater than or equal to 1 cm in diameter were imaged with doses of 40 mg or greater. Single-photon-emission-computed tomography could be carried out at the 120-mg and 300-mg doses and significantly improved tumor visualization. All patients produced anti-murine antibodies. We conclude that treatment with an MAb that inhibits EGF receptor function is safe at the doses and schedule studied. 111In-labeled MAb images squamous cell lung carcinoma; tumor uptake of the labeled MAb is dose dependent. Further studies are warranted to explore the potential therapeutic efficacy of anti-EGF receptor MAbs and other agents that act in a comparable manner.\r"

Results obtained by Northern and Western blot analyses and immunohistochemical methods were concordant. Immunohistochemical assessment of srp-27 expression in 300 breast carcinomas (with median patient follow-up of 8 years) was performed. Twenty-six percent of lymph node-negative and 45% of lymph node-positive tumors were overexpressors. Univariate analysis demonstrated significant correlations between srp-27 overexpression and estrogen receptor (ER) content, pS2 protein expression, nodal metastases, advanced T stage, lymphatic/vascular invasion, and a shorter disease-free survival period (but not a shorter overall survival) for the study population as a whole. Regression tree analysis showed that srp-27 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for disease-free survival only in patients with one to three positive lymph nodes. The Cox proportional hazards model confirmed the independent prognostic significance of nodal involvement, T stage, and ER content but failed to recognize srp-27 overexpression as a significant independent parameter predictive of patient outcome in the patient population as a whole. The observed associations between srp-27 overexpression and more aggressive tumors suggest a biologic role for srp-27 in human breast carcinomas.\r"

Three general strategies are being actively explored to overcome the problem: oxygenating the tumor, sensitizing the hypoxic cells to radiation (or chemotherapy), or killing the hypoxic cells (with a hypoxic cell cytotoxin). In the present study, we have examined the impact of each of these three strategies on a standard radiation therapy regimen (30 doses of 2 Gy), using either of two major assumptions: full reoxygenation or no reoxygenation of the tumor cells. We demonstrate that a hypoxic cell cytotoxin can produce a level of tumor cell killing higher (by several orders of magnitude) than that produced by full oxygenation of a tumor or by use of an optimum hypoxic cell radiosensitizer, provided the cytotoxin kills more than approximately 50% of the hypoxic cells each time it is given. The only assumption that makes a difference is whether reoxygenation occurs: In the worst case (ie, no reoxygenation), the hypoxic cell cytotoxin performs only as well as an optimum radiosensitizer. The analysis shows that hypoxic cells in tumors can be a major therapeutic advantage. Therefore, we recommend that research efforts be concentrated on development of superior hypoxic cell cytotoxins rather than improved hypoxic cell radiosensitizers and that, in parallel, emphasis be placed on development of agents to increase hypoxia.\r"

  ".W": "Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) is a potent inducer of differentiation of tumor cells. The effect of HMBA on cell growth and replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) was investigated in HEp-2 epidermal cells, IMR-32 neuronal cells, K562 myeloid cells, Daudi Burkitt lymphoma cells, and CCRF-CEM T-lymphoid cells. The growth of HEp-2 and IMR-32 cells was not affected by HMBA at concentrations from 0.5 through 2 mM. The growth of K562, Daudi, and CCRF-CEM cells was inhibited by HMBA at concentrations from 1 through 5 mM. When HSV-infected cells were incubated with 0.5 through 5 mM HMBA, a dose-dependent increase in virus yield was observed in HEp-2 and IMR-32 cells, but not in the other cell lines. These findings indicate that HMBA enhances the replication of HSV in epidermal and neuronal cells and that HMBA therapy may be responsible for the development of herpetic lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-three patients, 17 with stage IIIB and 36 with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer, were given CODE (cisplatin, vincristine, doxorubicin, and etoposide) plus antibiotic prophylaxis and an antiemetic regimen in an intensive chemotherapy program emphasizing weekly treatment and a planned brief duration (9-12 weeks); for 45 of these patients, the CODE program also included antifungal prophylaxis and supportive corticosteroids. Of the total study population, 33 patients (62%) responded to treatment, including five (9%) with complete response. The median survival for the entire group was 42 weeks (55 weeks for those with stage IIIB and 39 weeks for those with stage IV). More than 40% were alive at 1 year. Comparison of granulocyte counts of patients receiving prednisone with those of the subgroup to whom no corticosteroids were given showed less granulocytopenia for those receiving prednisone. Use of prednisone thus allowed improved delivery of myelosuppressive drugs. CODE was halted in nine patients because of disease progression. Although more constitutional side effects are associated with weekly chemotherapy than with standard chemotherapy, only 12 of the remaining 44 patients (27%) failed to receive at least 9 weeks of treatment. Serious toxicity was uncommon: There were no treatment-related deaths and only three episodes of neutropenia with fever. CODE is a novel treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer that this pilot study provided entirely in an outpatient setting over a 9-12 week period with an acceptable incidence of toxicity and a promising level of efficacy. Additional testing and comparison with other regimens or supportive care alone are warranted.\r"

The Rb-1 gene was altered in 40% of high-grade bone and soft-tissue tumors, but not in low-grade bone tumors and in only one low-grade, soft-tissue sarcoma. Overall, 10 of 25 high-grade sarcomas had detectable alterations of the Rb-1 gene compared with only 1 of 11 low-grade tumors.\r"

Our data reveal that there was rapid uptake of TNT-1 and its F(ab')2 fragment in both spheroid models, whereas an antibody of irrelevant specificity, Lym-1, and its F(ab')2 fragment bound poorly to the spheroids. Unlike previously reported monoclonal antibodies to tumor cell-surface antigens, TNT-1 showed 1) a linear uptake that increased over time without saturation in tumor spheroids and 2) an unexpected uptake by a subpopulation of cells in the viable outer rim of the spheroids. These preclinical studies provide important information concerning the therapeutic potential of TNT monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and micrometastases.\r"

Of 154 cases of ureteral units with ectasia reviewed ureteral fistulas were present in 19. Radiological ureteral obstruction appears to precede fistula formation. Symptoms, time of diagnosis and treatment according to the predominant etiology have been discussed. Etiological (in varying degrees of importance), clinical and diagnostic criteria, together with a management and therapeutic protocol in which early and late lesions are clearly differentiated were established, while bearing in mind that not all radiological obstruction patterns correspond to true ureteral lesions.\r"

However, there was a significant difference in the number of acute rejection episodes. In our series only male patients were affected. A sizable proportion of the patients (50%) had no detectable murmur over the graft area despite high blood pressure and increased creatinine levels. The absence of surgical injury during extraction and implantation of the grafts, together with the anatomical site of the stenosis and correlation with the degree of immunological intolerance suggest an immunological factor as the underlying cause in post-transplant renal artery stenosis.\r"

Urinary flow rate, free water clearance, and urinary excretion of NAG, kallikrein and beta 2-microglobulin were significantly increased 0 to 24 hours after ESWL. The urinary excretions of alkaline phosphatase, albumin and glycosaminoglycans were unchanged. Glomerular filtration rate was significantly decreased and effective renal plasma flow was unchanged. Filtration fraction was stable. Serum lactic dehydrogenase increased significantly after ESWL and remained high through the period of observation. Serum levels of creatinine, beta 2-microglobulin and aldosterone were unaltered. A decrease in plasma renin activity immediately after treatment is explained by the water immersion and the extracellular volume expansion during treatment.\r"

A nephrostomy tract was established successfully in all 19 procedures requiring an average of 12 minutes. Two major complications occurred that required blood transfusion and an open operation. Endourological treatment was successful in the remaining 17 cases. We believe that this technique provides an alternative to an open operation when standard access and dilation methods for endourological procedures are unsuccessful.\r"

We assessed the immune response in interstitial cystitis by evaluating lymphocyte populations in the peripheral blood and bladder tissue of interstitial cystitis patients. The lymphocyte phenotypes in peripheral blood were entirely normal, including the CD4 (cluster designation nomenclature) and CD8 subsets, and the CD4:CD8 ratio. Bladder lamina propria showed a predominance of CD4 over CD8 lymphocytes in interstitial and other forms of cystitis. Bladder epithelium showed a similar pattern in bacterial or mechanical cystitis but specimens from patients with interstitial cystitis had a predominance of CD8 cells. The findings of normal lymphocyte populations in the peripheral blood are not supportive of an autoimmune mechanism in the disease. The findings in bladder tissue show that the urothelium is not involved in the inflammatory reaction, as is the lamina propria, and they would suggest, therefore, that the initiating factor does not originate from the bladder lumen. The CD8 predominance in the urothelium along with a CD4 predominance in the lamina propria may form a characteristic pattern for the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis and merits further study.\r"

  ".U": "91108864\r", 
  ".W": "An orthotopically transplanted, locally metastasizing rat bladder tumor model was developed to evaluate the extent of uptake of fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) in bladder cancer. Significant uptake of FDG in localized bladder tumors in rats was shown, with an average tumor-to-blood ratio of 39 at 2 hours after intravenous FDG administration. Metastases (3 nodal and 1 peritoneal) also showed significant uptake of FDG, with an average metastasis-to-blood ratio of 21.7, and tumor involved-to-normal lymph node ratio of 5.3. Because FDG is excreted in the urine, urinary FDG potentially could prevent the use of FDG/positron emission tomography (FDG/PET) scanning for localized bladder cancer. Bladder lavage successfully reduced the retention of FDG in the normal rat bladder, with an estimated uptake ratio of tumor-to-normal bladder of 13.1 after 5 ml. saline irrigation. Based on these data, we performed an FDG/PET scan of a patient with biopsy proved recurrent intravesical bladder cancer after radiation therapy. Computerized tomography (CT) of the pelvis showed abnormalities consistent with radiation scarring and extravesical tumor. Due to the scarring, the extent of tumor growth could not be determined. The patient also had pulmonary opacities seen on chest radiography. The FDG/PET scan of this patient showed significant extravesical uptake in the pelvis, confirming the abnormality noted on CT. Good images of the clinically apparent metastases in the chest also were obtained. These preliminary data indicate that FDG/PET imaging of bladder cancer is feasible and it may provide new information for the diagnosis and staging of patients with bladder cancer.\r"

Of these patients sexual activity was restored in 91%. The dropout rate was 11.25%. The 114 episodes of prolonged erections among 51 patients (4.57%) represented less than 3 per 1,000 of the 34,875 recorded injections. All patients were treated without complications. The percentage of patients suffering from nodules or permanent deformations was 2.8%. There were no cases of intracavernous fibrosis. The percentage of satisfied patients (satisfaction index 7 or greater) was 84.8%. Improvement in spontaneous erections during sexual intercourse was obtained in 65% of the cases: 15% no longer needed self-injections and 50% only used them occasionally while 35% remained entirely dependent.\r"

All patients underwent full examination, hormonal assays and seminal fluid analysis before scrotal exploration, bilateral testicular biopsy and fixation. Seminal fluid analysis and hormonal assays were repeated 3 months postoperatively. Of the patients 36 were cured of recurrent pain, 35 of whom had a horizontally lying testis. No hormonal abnormalities were found preoperatively or postoperatively. Three patients had abnormal seminal fluid analysis. Testicular biopsies, including Johnsen scores, were abnormal in these 3 patients and normal in the other 33. It is concluded that patients with recurrent subacute torsion can be identified accurately and treated satisfactorily. There is little evidence that these patients suffer testicular damage as a result of this subacute torsion or that any pre-existing cellular abnormality exists to explain the oligospermia that frequently is seen in patients who have acute testicular torsion.\r"

All patients had normal human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein levels but persistent radiographic masses after chemotherapy. The operations included retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in 13 patients, thoracotomy in 15, hepatic resection in 3 and craniotomy in 1. Histological comparison of the specimens resected during post-chemotherapy operations 1 and 2 demonstrated different patterns in 7 of 15 patients. Of these 7 patients 4 had less favorable pathological features in the specimen removed during the second procedure. Residual malignant tumor or mature teratoma was found in at least 1 site in 12 of the 15 patients and only 3 had complete necrosis or fibrosis in both specimens examined. These data indicate the favorable impact of excising all post-chemotherapy tumor residuals in patients with advanced nonseminomatous testicular cancer. However, in patients with no teratomatous elements in the testicular tumor and complete necrosis or fibrosis in the initial post-chemotherapy operation specimen the probability of complete necrosis or fibrosis in remaining tumors appears to be high.\r"

  ".W": "Microwave hyperthermia is presently being investigated as a treatment for alleviating the symptoms of urinary outlet obstruction associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Two clinical techniques using intracavitary microwave applicators are being evaluated for safety and efficacy at various institutions. The transrectal technique uses a directional microwave radiator that is inserted into the rectum adjacent to the prostate. The transurethral approach uses a symmetrically radiating applicator located within the prostatic urethra. Transrectal prostatic heating techniques require surface cooling to prevent hazardous temperatures in the intervening rectal mucosa. Since transurethral applicators radiate from within the prostatic urethra, heating is confined to the obstructive tissue immediately surrounding the applicator. Concern has been expressed regarding the possibility of thermal injury to the prostate and adjacent rectum during transurethral hyperthermia treatment. In this report we present interstitial temperature measurements of prostatic and rectal temperatures in 5 patients. Temperature was observed to decrease at a rate of about 6C/cm. outward from the applicator. No clinically significant temperature increase was observed beyond 1 cm, outside the prostatic capsule or in the rectal mucosa.\r"

  ".U": "91108871\r", 
  ".W": "Benign prostatic hypertrophy, a common ailment among elderly men, usually is treated by surgery. Since androgens enhance prostatic hypertrophy, their withdrawal seems a logical way to treat this condition. Recently gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, known to produce \"chemical castration,\" have been tried in cases of benign prostatic hypertrophy. We report our experience with 20 men treated by a monthly injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone for prolonged periods. In 17 men treated for 6 months the prostatic volume decreased to an average of 63% of the initial volume; however, this did not correlate with clinical objective improvement. Only 6 men attained normal flow rates. Residual urine volume remained unaltered. Ten patients experienced subjective amelioration, while only 7 (40%) reported objective and subjective improvement. Maximal decrease in prostatic volumes was reached at 9 months of treatment and further treatment did not cause additional shrinkage. At 3 months after discontinuation of treatment prostatic volumes returned to 95 +/- 10.5% of pre-treatment values. A similar decrease in flow rates also was noted. Symptoms remained improved for longer periods. We conclude that this mode of treatment offers little to the majority of men with benign prostatic hypertrophy. Proper patient selection, based perhaps on serum prostate specific antigen, might augment positive results. This therapy should be restricted to patients considered high risk for any surgical and anesthetic intervention, and then it will have to be continued indefinitely.\r"

  ".U": "91108872\r", 
  ".W": "Presently, the standard staging evaluation of prostate cancer includes digital rectal examination, measurement of serum tumor markers and a radionuclide bone scan. To evaluate the ability of local clinical stage, tumor grade, serum acid phosphatase, serum prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) to predict bone scan findings, a retrospective review of 521 randomly chosen patients (mean age 70 years, range 44 to 92 years) with newly diagnosed, untreated prostate cancer was performed. Local clinical stage, tumor grade, acid phosphatase, PAP and PSA all correlated positively with bone scan findings (p less than 0.0001). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, however, PSA had the best over-all correlation with bone scan results. The median serum PSA concentration in patients with a positive bone scan was 158.0 ng./ml., whereas men with a negative bone scan had a median serum PSA level of 11.3 ng./ml. (p less than 0.0001). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, local clinical stage, tumor grade, acid phosphatase and PAP were evaluated in combination with PSA to assess whether these parameters increased the ability of PSA alone to predict bone scan findings. None of these clinical parameters, irrespective of the combination used, contributed appreciably to the predictive power of PSA alone. A probability plot with 95% confidence intervals was constructed that allows the practicing urologist to estimate on an individual basis the probability of a positive bone scan for any given serum PSA value. The most significant finding of this study, however, was the negative predictive value of a low serum PSA concentration for bone scan findings. In 306 men with a serum PSA level of 20 ng./ml. or less only 1 (PSA 18.2 ng./ml.) had a positive bone scan (negative predictive value 99.7%). This finding would suggest that a staging radionuclide bone scan in a previously untreated prostate cancer patient with a low serum PSA concentration may not be necessary.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the volume and distribution of residual cancer after transurethral resection of the prostate in stage A cancer patients 42 step-sectioned radical prostatectomy specimens were examined, and the volume, location, grade and extracapsular extension of the residual tumor were recorded. A total of 13 patients had stage A1 tumors (5% or less tumor in the transurethral resection specimen and a Gleason sum of 7 or less) and 29 had stage A2 disease. Residual cancer was present in the radical prostatectomy specimen in 41 patients (98%) with a mean volume of 1.28 cc. The location of residual cancer, that is multifocal (76%), peripheral (81%) and distal to the verumontanum (66%), makes complete removal or even identification of residual tumor (restaging) by repeat transurethral resection improbable. Of the stage A1 cancer patients 4 (30%) had more than 1 cc residual tumor volume, extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion. On the other hand, 14 of the stage A2 cancer patients (48%) had less than 1 cc residual tumor completely confined to the gland. Foci of residual cancer were found in the transition zone in 67% and in the peripheral zone in 90% of the patients. The grade of the residual peripheral zone cancer was significantly higher than that of the transition zone cancer in the same gland (p = 0.0004). Eight of 13 instances of extracapsular extension and all 5 of seminal vesicle invasion were directly attributable to peripheral zone cancer. These observations imply that the greatest threat to patients with stage A prostate cancer may be a separate, associated cancer in the peripheral zone rather than the primary transition zone cancer incidentally removed at transurethral resection.\r"

After stabilization on a metabolic diet, each subject ingested a single load of a test medication followed by timed urine collections for the next 24 hours. Test loads included potassium-magnesium citrate (49 mEq. potassium, 24.5 mEq. magnesium and 73.5 mEq. citrate), potassium citrate (50 mEq.), potassium chloride (50 mEq.) and magnesium citrate (25 mEq.) Urinary potassium, magnesium and citrate were measured for each collection period. Potassium-magnesium citrate provided an equivalent potassium bioavailability as potassium citrate and potassium chloride, and a comparable magnesium bioavailability as magnesium citrate. However, it gave the highest citraturic response, since the cumulative increment in urinary citrate post-load was 129 mg. daily for potassium-magnesium citrate, 105 mg. daily for potassium citrate and 35 mg. daily for magnesium citrate. Thus, potassium-magnesium citrate gave an optimum citraturic response in addition to providing absorbable potassium and magnesium.\r"

This method eliminates the scalpel, results in fewer hematomas and infections, and leaves a smaller wound than conventional techniques. An extracutaneous fixation ring clamp encircles and firmly secures the vas without penetrating the skin. A sharp curved hemostat punctures and dilates the scrotal skin and vas sheath. The vas is delivered, cleaned and occluded by the surgeon's preferred technique. The contralateral vas is delivered through the same opening. The puncture wound contracts to about 2 mm., is not visible to the man and requires no sutures for closure. The reported incidence of hematoma in 179,741 men followed in China was 0.09%. No hematomas or infections were identified in the first 273 procedures performed by a surgeon in the United States. The operating time in China and for the last 50 United States procedures has ranged from 5 to 11 minutes. The disadvantage of the technique is the hand-on training and number of cases necessary to gain proficiency. However, the advantages for surgeons and patients should enhance the popularity of vasectomy.\r"

Preoperative obstruction was demonstrated by a nephrostogram, diuretic renogram and/or ultrasonography. Percutaneous endopyelotomy was successful in relieving the obstruction in all 4 patients, although 2 required secondary endoscopic procedures. One patient had persistent obstruction 40 days after endopyelotomy at the ureteropelvic junction and, subsequently, required percutaneous resection of a persistent flap of obstructing tissue. In another patient a ureterovesical stricture was noted at the time of stent removal, which was treated by endoscopic incision. All patients have been followed from 1.5 to 3 years postoperatively. Followup diuretic renograms, ultrasound and/or excretory urography demonstrated a patent ureteropelvic junction in all patients and all have remained asymptomatic.

Although cystitis glandularis is widely regarded as premalignant few reports have documented its transition to adenocarcinoma.

To our knowledge this is the second case reported of pelvic lipomatosis associated with proliferative cystitis and adenocarcinoma of the bladder, indicating that intestinal metaplasia of the urothelium may be a precursor of malignancy in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Although potency can be preserved in most men following radical prostatectomy, in some patients one or both cavernous nerves must be sacrificed in order to excise all tumor. For these patients we have considered nerve reconstruction at the time of surgery using an interposition nerve graft. This possibility has been tested in a rat model. Animals were divided into three groups. In the sham control group, a pelvic exploration was conducted without division of the cavernous nerves. In the nerve ablation group, a five mm. segment of cavernous nerve was excised. In the graft group, five mm. of cavernous nerve was excised bilaterally and replaced with an interposition graft of genito-femoral nerve. At one month intervals postoperatively animals from each group underwent mating tests to determine potency; the ratio of vaginal intromission to unsuccessful mounts (I/M ratio) was determined. Following the mating tests the animals were re-explored and attempts were made to stimulate erections electrically via the pelvic nerve. Results at two months show the I/M ratio of the rats with grafts (0.05) and the nerve ablations (0.14) are low compared with the sham operated animals (1.0). By month four the graft group (0.89) has approached the sham group (0.91) while the ablation group (0.18) remains unchanged (p less than .05). Electrical stimulation at month two produced no erections in the nerve ablated or the grafted rats and 100% erections in the sham-operated animals. At month four, 50% of the rats with grafts, 10% of the nerve ablated animals, and 100% of the intact animals produced erections upon electrical stimulation (p less than .05). These results suggest that cavernous nerve grafting in rats can be successful in restoring potency after surgical injury. Application of these techniques to man may be indicated.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the application of longitudinal myotomy of ileum for bladder replacement, pressure/volume characteristics of myotomized ileal segments were studied in dogs after incorporation in the urinary tract. In five dogs a 12 cm. long myotomized ileal segment was incorporated in the left urinary system as a ureteral substitute. These ileal segments did not dilate. In another six animals total cystectomy was carried out and the bladder was replaced by a 12 cm. long myotomized ileal segment. Urodynamic and radiological studies demonstrated early dilatation of these segments, leading to a four-to-five-fold increase in volume after six weeks. During filling the intraluminar pressure remained below 20 cm. H2O up to two-thirds of the maximal volume and gradually rose when filling was continued. High pressure waves were not observed. This study demonstrates that in experimental dogs longitudinal myotomy of a short length of ileum results in a high volume/low pressure urinary reservoir. This technique is easy to perform, requires less bowel compared to current reservoir techniques and leads to satisfactory reservoir function.\r"

  ".W": "Suramin, a polyanionic compound with known antiparasitic activity, has been shown to be adrenocorticolytic in primates and to have clinical efficacy in the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer refractory to conventional hormonal manipulation. To better characterize the activity of suramin on prostate cancer biology, we studied the effect of the drug on plasma adrenal androgens of patients and on the human prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines PC-3, DU 145 and LNCaP-FGC. Five cancer patients treated with suramin had an approximate 40% decline in circulating androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels. The drug inhibited the colony formation in two of the three cell lines at concentrations clinically achievable in humans without excessive drug-related toxicity. The presence of suramin 300 micrograms./ml. partially inhibited the growth stimulatory effect of testosterone and basic fibroblast growth factor, but not that of epidermal growth factor. The cellular concentration of suramin following exposure to a single dose increases linearly over time in each of the cell lines with LNCaP-FGC accumulating the highest levels of the drug; cellular levels of suramin, not androgen or growth factor sensitivity, correlated with the sensitivity to the drug. The concentrations of prostatic acid phosphatase and prostatic specific antigen released by LNCaP-FGC cells in cell culture medium declined in the presence of increasing levels of suramin in a manner which exceeded the decrease in cell number. We conclude that suramin, aside from decreasing circulating androgens through its adrenocorticolytic effect, is also capable exerting a direct inhibitory effect on cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells, and interfere at a cellular level with the growth stimulatory effects of exogenous testosterone and basic fibroblast growth factor.\r"

The bioeffects of this modality of ESWL, therefore, require further assessment. Seven experimental groups of adult male rabbits were treated using the EDAP LT.01 in order to determine the acute and chronic bioeffects of clinical dose, excess dose, divided excess dose, high frequency and multiple treatment (X10) piezoelectric shockwaves (PSW). Renal function was measured before and after treatment using mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG 3) scans. Gross and histological morphological changes were assessed at one and 30 days following application of PSW. Application of single clinical dose PSW was not associated with any significant functional or morphological renal injury. Excess dose PSW caused transient gross renal contusion, which resolved in the majority of animals with no persistent microscopic abnormality. Divided excess dose PSW resulted in no gross or microscopic damage. High frequency PSW was associated with mild histological abnormality. Multiple PSW treatments caused small discrete fibrotic lesions in all cases, without any change in renal function.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether endocrine factors influence the volume of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 23 hormonal factors were measured in the serum of 64 men ages 42 to 71 years with low volume prostatic cancer and these levels were correlated with the volume of benign hyperplastic tissue in their radical prostatectomy specimens. With age there was a significant increase in the volume of BPH. Also with age there was a significant decrease in the serum levels of free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandronsterone (DHA), dehydroepiandronsterone sulphate (DHA-S), delta 5-androstenediol, and 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and a significant increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), LH, and FSH. When BPH volume and hormone levels were corrected for age, BPH volume correlated positively with free testosterone, estradiol, and estriol. These data indicate that with age patients with larger volumes of BPH have higher serum androgen and estrogen levels suggesting that serum androgen and estrogen levels may be factors in the persistent stimulation of BPH with age. If so, therapeutic attempts at lowering plasma testosterone levels, reducing estrogen levels, or blocking androgenic stimulation through other mechanisms may interfere with the progression of BPH with age. Conversely, the fact that androgen production declines gradually with age may explain the observation that only 20 to 30% of men who live to age 80 require surgical treatment for urinary obstruction from BPH.\r"

The absolute contractile responses of urinary bladder body and base strips to nerve stimulation, carbachol, 5-hydroxytryptamine, ATP, phenylephrine, and KCl were unaltered by diabetes. However, when the data were corrected for tissue mass, there were slight but not significant decreases in contractile responses of strips from diabetic rats. There were increases in total muscarinic receptor numbers and calcium channel binding sites in bladder bodies from BB rats as a result of the increases in tissue mass. The data indicate that the six month-diabetic BB rat differs from the streptozotocin-diabetic rat in the sensitivity of the urinary bladder to the complications of diabetes, probably as a result of the insulin treatment required to keep BB rats alive.\r"

For detection of the c-erbB-2 product, two specific antibodies, a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed to the intracellular domain and a murine monoclonal antibody recognizing an epitope in the extracellular domain, were used. Seventeen cases of bladder cancer were stained by the anti-c-erbB-2 polyclonal antibody, while 20 cases were stained by the monoclonal antibody, with good correlation on both stainings (p less than 0.01). There were four c-erbB-2 positive cases in 26 G1 tumors, four in 15 G2 tumors, and nine in 13 G3 tumors. There were also eight erbB-2 positive cases in nine muscle-invasive tumors, nine of 45 superficial tumors, four of five with lymph node metastasis, and seven of 14 without metastasis, as revealed by staining with the polyclonal antibody. Thus, the c-erbB-2 gene product was more frequently expressed in high grade tumors (p less than 0.01), in high stage tumors (p less than 0.01), and nodal metastatic tumors (N.S. by Chi-square test). Twenty-two of the 54 tumors were stained by an anti-EGF-R monoclonal antibody, 528 IgG. The expression of EGF-R was independent of histological grading, tumor stage, and nodal status, and no correlation was observed between expression of the c-erbB-2 product and EGF-R. The c-erbB-2 product may be applicable as a tumor marker for evaluation of malignant potential, invasiveness, and probably metastatic potential of human bladder cancer.\r"

Using a single-blind study design, nine adult male dogs underwent intravaginal spermatic cord torsion and subsequent evaluation with technetium 99M-pertechnetate radionuclide, and color doppler ultrasound imaging techniques. Torsions of 90 to 720 degrees were created surgically, followed by examination with each modality at one hour (four animals), and four hours (five animals) following the procedure. Testicular torsion was diagnosed if perfusion was absent or markedly diminished on color doppler imaging or radionuclide scan. In all cases of 360 degrees or greater, torsion was diagnosed by either modality at both one and four hour time delays. If observers did not diagnose torsion, they were asked to assess the relative testicular perfusion. Color doppler ultrasound and radionuclide scanning were without error in correctly detecting a relative decrease in perfusion in each of these instances. Furthermore, color doppler imaging with spectral analysis was able to detect an enhancement of the diastolic component of the arterial signal at 180 degrees of torsion. This spectral pattern coupled with a relative decrease in blood flow allowed presumptive diagnosis at one hour of partial torsion that was subsequently apparent as absent perfusion only after 4 hours on radionuclide and repeat color doppler ultrasound. Color doppler ultrasound proved to be superior to radionuclide scanning in detecting diminished perfusion in this experiment. The detailed information provided by spectral and anatomic display with color doppler ultrasound recommends it for the evaluation of acute scrotal pathology of uncertain etiology.\r"

REE, measured over 20-40 min by indirect calorimetry using a ventilated canopy, averaged 0.98 +/- 0.15 kcal/min on day 3 and decreased to 0.93 +/- 0.15 kcal/min on day 8-9 postsurgery (p less than 0.02). REE was positively correlated with body weight (r = 0.69, p less than 0.005). Mean REE extrapolated to 24 hr (24-REE) was 1283 +/- 194 kcal/day. Mean daily food energy intake measured over the 5-day follow-up period was 1097 +/- 333 kcal/day and was positively correlated with 24-REE (r = 0.50, p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "The relative contributions of skeletal muscle and the pulmonary bed in maintaining amino acid homeostasis were studied. Inasmuch as more than 60% of whole blood amino acid nitrogen is transported as glutamine and alanine, the flux of these two amino acids across the lungs (n = 20) and hindquarter (n = 20) was determined in the postabsorptive adult rat. Both skeletal muscle and the lungs released net amounts of glutamine and alanine in the postabsorptive state. Blood flow to the hindquarter was approximately 16% of cardiac output (3.8 +/- 0.3 cc/100 g BW/min), while pulmonary blood flow (cardiac output) was 23.7 +/- 1.7 cc/100 g BW/min. Thus, despite a lower glutamine concentration difference across the lungs (-32 +/- 6 mumol/liter) compared with the hindquarter (-59 +/- 10 mumol/liter (p less than 0.01), the lungs released significantly more glutamine (741 +/- 142 nmol/100 g BW/min) than the hindquarter (208 +/- 39 nmol/100 g BW/min) (p less than 0.01) because of the significantly higher pulmonary blood flow. Similarly, the concentration difference for alanine across the lungs was less than that of the hindquarter (-24 +/- 8 mumol/liter vs -60 +/- 12 mumol/liter, p less than 0.01) but the lungs released significantly more alanine than the hindquarter (553 +/- 159 nmol/100 g BW/min vs 221 +/- 41 nmol/100 g BW, p less than 0.01. Compositional studies demonstrated that the hindquarter comprises 40% of total body muscle mass in the rat; thus both total skeletal muscle mass and the lungs contribute approximately equally to the maintenance of blood glutamine and alanine levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this phase 1 study was to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of a recombinant growth factor, human growth hormone (GH), combined with nutritional support in a critical care unit. Following an initial control week, 11 individuals received GH (10 mg/day) daily for 1-6 consecutive weeks. Near constant nutrient intake was provided via parenteral and/or enteral feedings throughout the study period. Vital signs and other clinical parameters, blood values, and nutrient excretion were monitored daily. GH administration was not associated with clinically significant adverse effects. During the first 2 weeks of study, nitrogen excretion decreased from 1356 +/- 157 mmol/day (19.0 +/- 2.2 g/day) during control to 899 +/- 107 mmol/day (12.6 +/- 1.4 g/day) with growth hormone (p less than 0.002) in association with markedly reduced urea generation. Significant reductions in potassium excretion (control 100 +/- 11 mmol/day vs 69 +/- 6 with GH; p less than 0.01) and phosphorus excretion (31 +/- 5 mmol/day vs 18 +/- 3; p less than 0.025) also occurred during GH. The protein-conserving effects of GH were sustained during several weeks of treatment. Growth hormone enhanced the efficiency of administered protein and facilitated nitrogen retention without clinically significant adverse effects in this small patient group. Controlled trials are indicated to determine whether use of this anabolic hormone reduces hospitalization time and improves other clinical outcomes in severely injured patients when combined with appropriate nutritional support.\r"

When infused for 1 hr every 8 hr through the catheter at the daily dose recommended for a 10-kg child (450 mg), vancomycin alone reduced bacterial colonization but failed to sterilize the inserts. Vancomycin was more active in combination with netilmicin (25 mg for 1 hr every 8 hr), rifampin (150 mg for 90 min every 12 hr), or fosfomycin (500 mg for 4 hr every 6 hr), but the catheters were inconsistently decontaminated after 3 days of treatment. Two nonconventional modes of antibiotic administration were tested for their capacity to ensure high levels of vancomycin in the catheter lumen over a prolonged time. Vancomycin infused continuously through the catheter at a daily dose of 450 mg had the same poor sterilizing effect as vancomycin administered intermittently. On the contrary, catheters were totally decontaminated when 2.5 mg of vancomycin in a volume of 0.5 ml were injected twice daily into noninfused catheters, confirming that the antibiotic-lock technique is an approach of great interest to sterilize the internal surface of catheters colonized with staphylococci.\r"

  ".W": "One of the major clinical manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex (ARC) is the development of cachexia. This most likely results from a multifactorial interplay of poor diet, malabsorption, and altered metabolism. To assess the potential role of nutrient intake in the development or persistence of malnutrition, a detailed analysis was performed of a 72-hr diet record in clinically stable patients with AIDS (N = 18), ARC (N = 12) and in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive controls without significant manifestations of disease (N = 13). Total calorie intake was 39.1 +/- 13.2 kcal/kg/day in AIDS patients vs 34.6 +/- 7.8 kcal/kg/day in ARC patients or 31.9 +/- 17.7 kcal/kg/day in HIV seropositive cases (all p = NS). Likewise, mean protein intakes were similar among the groups and exceeded recommended daily dietary allowance (RDA) guidelines. The mean body weight changes from the inception of illness were -11 +/- 1% in AIDS, -6 +/- 7% in ARC, vs +3 +/- 2% in HIV-seropositive-only cases (p less than 0.05 vs AIDS and ARC). Dietary vitamin and mineral analysis revealed that 88% of AIDS, 88% of HIV seropositive, and 89% of ARC patients were ingesting less than 50% RDA for at least one nutrient. The mean number of deficiencies per patient was 1.8 +/- 1.3 in AIDS, 3.8 +/- 3.5 in ARC, and 2.9 +/- 2.5 in HIV-seropositive-only cases (p less than 0.05 AIDS vs ARC). There were no significant correlations between specific anthropometric measurements and dietary intakes of protein or fat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both techniques resulted in the estimate that Cori cycle activity accounts for about 15% of plasma glucose appearance. However, it is now understood that the specific activity of gluconeogenic precursors, which is used to determine their contribution to glucose appearance in plasma, overestimates the true precursor specific activity. Using earlier published data on substrate utilization and glucose turnover kinetics in humans, an empiric correction factor of 2.7 is derived which may approximately account for label dilution in the precursor pool. Use of this factor confirms that the former estimate of the contribution of Cori cycle activity to glucose turnover should be revised substantially upwards.\r"

  ".W": "In summary, a remarkably close agreement exists for the mean MEE measured in 28 studies of severe burn trauma. This is especially surprising given the variability in sample sizes, measurement techniques, study designs, and DPBs studied. The mean MEE calculated from the data published in these reports is listed in the final column of Table I. For more than 450 cases, an unweighted MEE is 2750 +/- 85 kcal/day. For those studies prior to 1980, the mean MEE exceeds 3000 kcal/day in eight of 14 reports vs only two of 14 published after 1980. Even so, the mean MEE for the pre-1980 reports differs by only 200 kcal/day (2960 +/- 120, n = 14). The accepted notion that the degree of elevation in MEE is in proportion to the % BSAB up to about 60% BSAB is useful in a general sense but must be applied with caution. The recent studies, which include proportionately more burns exceeding 80% BSAB, suggest an elevation in MEE in these cases. Nevertheless, a physiologic plateau apparently exists at or slightly below 2 x normal RMR at the peak of MEE. The magnitude of the MEE response results from an undefined interaction among several factors of which some have been examined while others such as inflammatory mediators are only beginning to receive study. The contributions to reduction in MEE from interventions to control cardiac output and peripheral cooling, core temperature, evaporative water (heat) loss, and substrate cycling have been reviewed. The importance of indirect calorimetry in patient care is highlighted by the large variability in similarly injured individuals and in the unexplained component of regression analyses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of all patients who received their primary treatment for follicular thyroid cancer at the Mayo Clinic between 1946 and 1970. The diagnosis was confirmed by reexamination of preserved tissue specimens. The 57 female and 43 male patients (mean age, 53 years) underwent follow-up for a maximum of 32 years (mean, 17.4 years). All patients were treated surgically, and total removal of primary tumor was thought to have been accomplished in all but three. Only 2 of the 88 patients without distant metastatic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis underwent ablation of the thyroid remnant. At the conclusion of the study, 52 patients had died, thyroid cancer being the cause of death in 19. On the basis of univariate survival analysis, age more than 50 years, tumor size that exceeded 3.9 cm, higher tumor grade, presence of marked vascular invasion, adjacent tissue invasion, and distant metastatic involvement at the time of initial diagnosis were associated with increased cancer mortality. Multivariate analysis (by Cox proportional hazards model), however, identified only age greater than 50 years, marked vascular invasion, and metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis to be independent predictors of follicular thyroid cancer-related mortality. Patients with two or more of these predictors were classified as being high risk. These patients had 5- and 20-year survival rates of 47% and 8%, respectively; the corresponding survival data for the low-risk group were 99% at 5 years and 86% at 20 years. The identification of these risk groups may facilitate a more rational approach to treatment of follicular thyroid cancer.\r"

This manifestation of hepatotoxicity seems to differ from that previously reported in association with use of crystalline niacin, which occurred with high dosage and prolonged usage of the medication. In view of the recent increased frequency of prescribing niacin for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, physicians should be aware of the potential for hepatotoxicity with even low-dose and short-term use of time-release niacin.\r"

All symptomatic cases of consolidation were acute (symptoms for less than 1 month), and most were in young patients (mean age, 34 years). Consolidation constituted 58% of the acute cases in this series. Two of the nine cases of consolidation were asymptomatic epidemic cases detected by screening. A pulmonary mass was the most common initial manifestation in this series; it tended to occur in patients with chronic symptoms (more than 1 month). The mass was considered suggestive enough of bronchogenic carcinoma to necessitate resection in 55% of cases. The military form of pulmonary blastomycosis occurred in older patients with disseminated disease. Fibrotic and cavitary disease was chronic in nature. The presence of intermediate-sized nodules elsewhere in the lung proved to be a helpful diagnostic finding in several patients with consolidation, mass, or cavitary disease. Hilar adenopathy, postinfectious calcification, chest wall invasion, and pleural effusion occurred infrequently or not at all in this series.\r"

The method of evaluation must be reliable and accurate without compromising the condition of the patient. We report the development of a back isometric dynamometer (BID-2000) designed specifically by two of us to address these concerns in elderly patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis. As the demographics of the general population change, increasing numbers of patients will need the type of monitoring that the BID-2000 provides. Aging has been shown to cause a reduction in the number of functional muscle motor units. To examine this effect on BES, we tested 50 normal, healthy women who were 30 to 79 years old. Proper testing of BES in patients with fragile vertebrae should include isometric measurement in the prone position, maneuverability of the device to allow comfortable positioning of the patient, and simplicity of technique to minimize repetitious performance of maximal contraction. The BID-2000 incorporates each of these features and also provides meaningful results inexpensively. The device offers a safe, reliable (coefficient of variation = 2.33%), and valid (P = 0.001) method of evaluation. The results of our study demonstrated moderate, steady reduction of BES with increasing age and with each successive decade.\r"

Two independent observers reviewed the new information with regard to pertinent historical, clinical, and laboratory data. The perioperative mortality was 20%. Among the perioperative survivors, 1- and 2-year survival rates were 95% and 77%, respectively. The 3-year actuarial survival was 70%. Uniformly, the symptoms diminished, and the need for antianginal medication was decreased. In the three other large published series, the perioperative mortality ranged from 3 to 20%, and coronary artery bypass performed earlier after the onset of the symptoms seemed to result in a lower perioperative mortality. We conclude that elective coronary artery bypass in dialysis patients is associated with acceptable short-term morbidity and mortality and effective relief of symptoms. Surgically treated patients may have a survival advantage. Thus, we advocate aggressive early investigation and surgical treatment of these patients.\r"

It exhibits a high oxygen affinity, with a P50 (oxygen tension at 50% saturation) of 19.3 torr for the patient's whole blood. The substitution of hemoglobin Columbia Missouri is an internal residue near the end of the F helix of the alpha chain. Hemoglobin Okazaki has an arginyl residue substitution for a cysteinyl residue at F9 (beta 93) in the beta chain. In comparison with hemoglobin Okazaki, the substitution in hemoglobin Columbia Missouri has a more pronounced effect on oxygen affinity. Consequently, hemoglobin Columbia Missouri is associated with erythrocytosis, whereas hemoglobin Okazaki is not.\r"

  ".W": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is an insidiously developing, adult-onset, progressive anterior horn cell degeneration with associated degeneration of descending motor pathways. It has been recognized as an important clinical syndrome since the middle of the 19th century. Despite increasing clinical and research interest in this condition, its cause remains obscure, even in the broadest terms. Epidemiologic characteristics of the disease have been interpreted as evidence of both genetic and environmental causes. A major change in the view of this disease is the widely developing perception that it is a disease of elderly persons more than of middle-aged adults as was previously taught. Etiologic hypotheses encompass a broad range of postulated pathophysiologic mechanisms, and we review these in detail. The clinical limits of the disease can now be better defined by using modern diagnostic techniques. Although interest in supportive symptomatic therapy is growing, no intervention has yet been shown to modify the biologically determined motor system degeneration.\r"

  ".U": "91109414\r", 
  ".W": "A case of common variable immunodeficiency, a relatively rare disorder, is presented. This case was complicated by the presence of an anti-IgA antibody in the patient's serum and a history of a possible anaphylactic reaction to a prior intravenous infusion of gamma-globulin. Common variable immunodeficiency is actually a heterogeneous group of demonstrable immunoglobulin deficiencies that have in common low levels of most immunoglobulin isotypes, the inability to form antibodies to antigen, an absence of gross defects in cell-mediated immunity, and the presence of recurrent bacterial infections. The history of immunoglobulin deficiency and its treatment is reviewed. Although the primary therapy for common variable immunodeficiency is gamma-globulin replacement, ancillary measures such as early treatment of infections with antibiotics are also important. Intravenous gamma-globulin replacement therapy is preferred to intramuscular replacement therapy in these patients because intramuscular doses must be limited in volume to minimize local pain and take 2 to 14 days to achieve maximal blood levels, during which time in situ degradation of up to 50% of the administered dose can occur. Five intravenous gamma-globulin preparations are currently available in the United States. The potential adverse effects of intravenous gamma-globulin infusion and the precautions currently taken to ensure safety during administration of this product are discussed.\r"

Clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic studies helped distinguish this disorder from other causes of brachial plexopathy in patients with cancer. Treatment with corticosteroids seemed beneficial in this patient. We suggest that this may be another type of paraneoplastic condition associated with Hodgkin's disease.\r"

The 64 deaths recorded did not exceed those expected for the general population adjusted for age, sex, and calendar period. We suggest that a policy of prophylactic anticoagulation for patients with AT-III deficiency cannot be recommended.\r"

Strains with localised adherence were significantly associated with acute non-bloody diarrhoea, whereas strains with aggregative adherence were significantly associated with persistent diarrhoea. Half the strains with localised adherence were not enteropathogenic E coli serotypes nor did they hybridise with an enteropathogenic E coli adherence factor DNA probe. All strains with localised adherence gave a positive fluorescent actin staining (FAS) assay, irrespective of serotype. One-third of children colonised by aggregative strains had bloody diarrhoea. Isolation of strains with diffuse adherence was not related to type or duration of diarrhoea but was generally associated with isolation of another pathogenic organism.\r"

The incidence of definite cytological evidence of CIN was significantly lower in women whose first smear did not include an endocervical component. It is concluded that women whose smears are reported as negative but lack an endocervical component should not be rescreened any earlier than women with negative smears that include an endocervical component.\r"

The proportion of patients undergoing splenectomy has progressively decreased, and age at splenectomy has increased with time over the past 20 years. Age at first transfusion exceeds 4 years in a small but important group of patients, which indicates that a milder form of thalassaemia exists in this group. Children receiving modern treatment remain of near-normal stature until age 11 but later tend to be stunted. The mean blood requirement is 35% higher in non-splenectomised than in splenectomised patients. Differences in transfusion interval of 2 to 4 weeks have no measurable effect on blood requirement. Mean blood requirement rises gradually with mean haemoglobin concentration, possibly in a non-linear fashion. The prevalence of red cell alloimmunisation rises with delay in start on transfusion. Transfusion reactions were reported in 1% of transfusions (90% of which were leucocyte-depleted), from 17% of patients.\r"
