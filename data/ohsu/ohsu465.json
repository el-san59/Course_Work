We observed that patients receiving rhGM-CSF in vivo exhibited primed O2- release after stimulation both with fMLP and PMA. Chemotaxis, however, was not enhanced by the treatment. These data suggest that host defenses may be enhanced by this treatment and that rhGM-CSF may be a useful therapeutic adjunct in compromised patients.\r"

In this study recombinant human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) was administered to cancer patients to determine whether the cytotoxic and secretory activity of their blood monocytes could be enhanced. Patients with refractory neoplastic disease were treated with rGM-CSF either as a single bolus or as a constant infusion for 14 days at either 100 or 500 micrograms/m2 per day. As has been reported by others, the number of peripheral blood monocytes and granulocytes rose markedly in a dose-response fashion during infusion with rGM-CSF. The functional capacity of monocytes was increased by rGM-CSF, since the cytotoxicity of monocytes against antibody-coated xenogeneic cells was increased during the constant infusion compared to baseline. In addition, monocytes harvested during the constant infusion and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro secreted increased quantities of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon (IFN). These data indicate that rGM-CSF can enhance both the number and the function of peripheral blood monocytes in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Idiotypes are distinct clonal markers for B-cell lymphomas. Previously we reported the use of anti-idiotype antibodies in the therapy of patients with B-cell malignancies. Because synergy was demonstrated with the addition of alpha interferon to anti-idiotype antibodies in a murine lymphoma model, we performed a clinical trial combining these two agents. Here we provide an update of the original trial of anti-idiotype antibodies alone and report the outcome of the new combination trial. In 16 treatment courses of anti-idiotype antibodies alone there were seven partial responses and one complete response. In 12 courses of combination anti-idiotype antibody and alpha interferon there were two complete responses and seven partial responses. Substantial tumor regressions occurred with minimal toxicity in both trials even in patients refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Tumor specimens obtained at the time of disease progression often contained a preponderance of idiotype-negative lymphoma cells, suggesting that anti-idiotype antibody treatment exerted a strong antitumor effect against antigen-positive cells. Anti-idiotype antibodies have reproducible objective antitumor activity in B-cell lymphoma. The addition of alpha interferon may improve the initial rate of response to this treatment. Strategies that deal effectively with idiotype-negative lymphoma cells should improve the extent and duration of these responses.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human (rh) interleukin-6 (IL-6), in a dose range of 1 to 10 U/mL, was able to induce a low number of neutrophilic-granulocytic colonies in a CFU-GM clonogenic assay, using T cells and adherent cells, depleted low density marrow cells. A synergistic increase in the number of granulocytic colonies was observed when rhGM-CSF at suboptimal doses and IL-6 at effective doses were both present in the assay; the increase was only additive when either rhIL-1 alpha or rhIL-3 was used together with IL-6. To determine whether the increase in colony number reflects the interactions of these factors on the same hematopoietic progenitor target cells or, instead, represents activation of accessory cells, we analyzed the effect of IL-6 on the proliferation and differentiation of three growth factor-dependent leukemic cell lines that respond with continuous proliferation to the presence of GM-CSF and IL-3 in culture. One of the three cell lines (AML-193) showed limited proliferation in the presence of IL-6 followed by terminal differentiation after 14 days into basophilic-granulocytic-like cells. A synergistic proliferative response was observed on the same cells treated with both GM-CSF and IL-6. These data support the hypothesis that IL-6 may have a direct effect on myeloid hematopoietic progenitor cells, and that GM-CSF interacts synergistically with IL-6 by acting on the same target cells.\r"

Both recombinant interleukin-3 (r-IL-3) and recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) increased megakaryocyte (MK) colony formation (P less than .01) above that observed in baseline cultures. Recombinant interleukin-4 (rIL-4) and interleukin 1 alpha (rIL-1 alpha) failed either to promote MK colony formation alone or to increase rIL-3 or rGM-CSF promoted colony formation. Recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo) and purified thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (TSF) did not increase (P greater than .05) MK colony formation when added alone but synergized with rIL-1 alpha, leading to a twofold increase in MK colony formation. Such a synergistic relationship was not observed between rIL-4 and rEpo. In addition, TSF enhanced the ability of rIL-3 but not rGM-CSF to promote MK colony formation. Addition of rEpo to optimal or suboptimal concentrations of rGM-CSF or suboptimal concentrations of rIL-3 resulted in a significant increase (P less than .05) in the total number of MK-containing colonies, due to the appearance of multilineage colonies containing MKs. The addition of rEpo to optimal concentrations of rIL-3 resulted in increased numbers of multilineage colonies containing MKs; however, the number of total MK-containing colonies was not significantly increased when compared to assays containing rIL-3 alone. By contrast, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibited both rIL-3, and rGM-CSF promoted MK colony formation, with optimal inhibition resulting in a 35%-45% reduction of MK colony formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since fetal calf serum was included in these cultures and itself might contain growth factors or other cofactors, we re-examined the actions of the CSFs in serum-deprived conditions. Results show that both the multipoietins are inadequate stimuli of colony formation. At maximal concentrations IL-3 alone induces only 25% of the granulocyte and macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-G and CFU-M) produced by a T-cell conditioned medium that contains a mixture of CSFs. When IL-3 was added at the initiation of the cultures and erythropoietin (ep), G-CSF, or M-CSF added on day 3, almost full recovery of erythroid, granulocytic, and monocytic colonies, respectively, was obtained. Similar results were obtained with GM-CSF except that fewer erythroid colonies were recovered at high concentrations, and almost maximal CFU-M proliferation could be induced. These results show that in serum-deprived conditions, the multipoietins must be combined with lineage specific CSFs for full progenitor expression.\r"

Ten of 11 evaluable patients with aplastic anemia had substantial increments in granulocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils associated with myeloid and eosinophilic hyperplasia in the bone marrow. Patients with pretreatment granulocytes greater than 0.3 x 10(9)/L had greater increments in circulating myeloid cells than patients with more severe granulocytopenia. Only one patient had improvement in erythrocytes and platelets. Blood counts fell to baseline after rhGM-CSF treatment was discontinued. Doses up to 16 micrograms/kg/d were relatively well tolerated in the absence of extreme leukocytosis. Fatigue and myalgia were common. Three patients developed pulmonary infiltrates that resolved with discontinuation of treatment. Patients tended to have recurrent inflammation in previously diseased tissues. These data indicate that rhGM-CSF will increase circulating granulocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils in patients with refractory aplastic anemia. Further studies are necessary to determine if rhGM-CSF treatment will reduce morbidity or improve survival.\r"

  ".W": "PADGEM protein, a platelet alpha granule membrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 140,000, is translocated to the plasma membrane during granule secretion and platelet activation. PADGEM protein is expressed on the surface of activated platelets but not on the surface of resting platelets. Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells contain platelet alpha granule-like organelles, alpha granule proteins, and express platelet membrane glycoproteins GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb. We demonstrate that HEL cells express a protein that has a molecular weight identical to that of PADGEM and binds to anti-PADGEM antibodies. The exposure of HEL cells in culture to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) increased the number of cells expressing PADGEM. Fluorescence activated flow cytometric analysis demonstrated an increase in mean surface expression of PADGEM in DMSO-exposed cells compared to noninduced cells. Total cell content of PADGEM was increased 5.3-fold after DMSO exposure, as determined by radioimmunoassay. Direct binding experiments with the monoclonal anti-PADGEM antibody KC4 demonstrated specific, saturable, and time-dependent interaction of KC4 with HEL cells. A Kd of 7 nM was estimated. There were 14,000 surface binding sites per cell in noninduced cells and 24,000 surface binding sites per cell in DMSO-induced HEL cells. Surface expression of PADGEM protein on HEL cells was not increased with platelet agonists, including thrombin, epinephrine, ADP, nor cytokines, including IL-1, IL-2, tissue necrosis factor. The presence of PADGEM protein in HEL cells should facilitate the elucidation of the function of PADGEM protein.\r"

  ".W": "It has been previously shown that fibrinogen (FG) associates specifically with human umbilical vein and bovine aortic endothelial cells (EC) in culture and induces EC migration. In the present study, we have investigated whether the FG-EC interaction is mediated by an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) recognition specificity and whether EC membrane proteins related to platelet GPIIb-IIIa are involved. Highly purified radioiodinated human FG, containing no detectable fibronectin, interacted with cultured human and bovine EC in suspension in a time-dependent and specific manner. The binding was inhibited by EDTA. Two polyclonal antibodies to platelet GPIIb-IIIa, which immunoprecipitated a heterodimer molecule from EC, inhibited FG binding to EC. These same antibodies inhibited FG-induced EC migration in a dose-dependent manner as measured in a Boyden chamber. Preabsorption of the antibodies with purified platelet GPIIb-IIIa markedly reduced both inhibitory activities. A series of synthetic RGD-containing peptides inhibited FG binding to EC and FG-induced EC migration. Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp (GRGD) was the most active peptide tested in inhibiting FG binding and EC migration (ID50 of 30 microM), and conservative substitutions in the RGD sequence markedly reduced inhibitory activity (ID50 greater than 1,000 microM). These results indicate that FG binding and EC migration are events mediated by an RGD recognition specificity and that EC surface proteins immunologically related to the GPIIb-IIIa complex on platelets are involved in this recognition.\r"

  ".W": "Using several multiple drug-resistant human myeloma cell lines as standards, we developed an immunohistochemical staining technique and means of quantitating P-glycoprotein in individual myeloma cells. The level of staining intensity for P-glycoprotein in individual myeloma cells was quantitated by measuring the average optical density of each cell with a microscopic computerized cell analysis system. Using this system, we observed that the level of P-glycoprotein for individual cells within a cell population of known drug sensitivity was very homogeneous (coefficient of variation less than or equal to 13%). Analysis of cell lines with gradually increasing levels of multidrug resistance (8226/S, 8226/Dox6 and 8226/Dox40) demonstrated a close association between the level of resistance to doxorubicin, defined by the mean lethal dose (D0) and the amount of P-glycoprotein on individual cells determined by the optical density (r = 0.82, P less than 0.0005). Intracellular doxorubicin (DOX) accumulation in the individual cell lines was inversely related to the level of drug resistance expressed as D0. P-glycoprotein was also detected in the marrow-derived myeloma cells of patients with drug refractory disease using immunohistochemical staining. The amount of P-glycoprotein in the cells of one patient was directly compared to the amount found in the simultaneously stained standard cell lines (8226/Dox6 and 8226/Dox40) by comparing the optical densities for individual cells. Using this immunohistochemical technique to detect and quantitate P-glycoprotein in patient myeloma cells and comparing it to standard multidrug resistant myeloma cell lines may be of value in determining the contribution of P-glycoprotein to clinical drug resistance in patients with multiple myeloma.\r"

  ".W": "In a four year span, between 1983 and 1987, 215 bone marrow and cell culture samples from 125 myeloma patients were immunotyped and coexpression of myelomonocytic and plasma cell antigens occurred in 16 (13%). We employed both immunohistochemical and flow cytometry methods including coplots and double labelling. Three types of myeloma cases were found: (1) those with isolated myeloid antigen coexpression, usually Leu M1 or esterase (BE, CE) positive (11 cases); (2) those with multiple myeloid antigens (Leu M1, M3, M5, MY7, BE, CE) (four cases); and (3) one case beginning as 1 and ending as 2. Isolated myeloid antigen expression was generally associated with typical features of myeloma with survival close to the anticipated median (33 months), while multiple myeloid antigen expression was associated with more aggressive disease and shorter survival duration (median survival 16 months). The latter subgroup also had other poor prognostic factors including high labelling index and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) positivity. Other features found overall were frequent abnormal karyotypes (seven of 12 abnormal) and coexpressed IgA (eight of 16); all IgA+ cases also coexpressed Leu M1. We conclude that there is an unusual and unexpected predilection for coexpression of myelomonocytic antigens in myeloma cells. The reasons are not immediately obvious. Whether the coexpression indicates that myeloma cells truly have latent multilineage potential or just aberrantly coexpress other hematopoietic antigens as a manifestation of malignancy remains to be explained. However, a cell line established from the bone marrow of one patient is a valuable scientific tool allowing detailed analysis of these questions.\r"

When cultured, Bsp-1 positive cells from all CML and AML patients showed the same clonal karyotype changes observed in diagnostic buffy coat preparations, indicating that the basophilic cells were of leukemic origin. In contrast, T lymphocytes from four of five CML patients cultured in the presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2) showed a normal karyotype and were therefore not derived from the leukemic clone. Bsp-1 staining correlated with toluidine blue-positive basophils in chronic phase CML and with toluidine blue-negative blast cells expressing an immature myeloid phenotype in blast crisis CML and AML. Chromosome in situ hybridization showed that the ABL oncogene was translocated from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22 in the CML patients but remained on chromosome 9 in the AML patients. These results indicate that the breakpoint at 9q34 in CML is 5' of ABL, whereas the breakpoint at 9q34 in AML is 3' of ABL. Field inversion gel electrophoresis showed that the 9q34 breakpoint was not within 200 kb 3' of ABL in one of the AML patients, nor was there any rearrangement of the PIM oncogene locus at 6p21.\r"

These clones produce high levels of abnormally regulated proto-oncogene transcripts and fail to terminally differentiate in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide. To determine the relative levels at which the two proto-oncogenes might exert their inhibitory effects, we asked whether these clones could express differentiated functions in the absence of terminal differentiation. It was found that exposure of c-myc-transfected cells to hemin allows for the induction of hemoglobin, whereas c-myb-transfected cells were refractory to hemin induction. It thus appears that c-myb exerts a more globally suppressive effect on F-MEL-differentiated functions than does c-myc and may prevent the expression of those events that can otherwise be dissociated from the terminally differentiated state.\r"

  ".W": "A t(14;18) (q32;q21) chromosome translocation is closely associated with the follicular lymphoma, which is prevalent in the United States, and the t(14;18) causes the juxtaposition of a bcl-2 gene on chromosome 18 with an immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus on chromosome 14. Genomic DNAs from 30 Japanese patients with follicular lymphoma were examined for the molecular features by Southern blot hybridization. Using probe b for the major breakpoint cluster region of a bcl-2 gene, the rearrangements were detected in eight patients. Six of the eight patients had breakpoints located within the major breakpoint region, while two had breakpoints outside this cluster region but within the region of the 7.5-kb SstI fragment containing the probe b sequence. In two patients, pFL-2 probe detected the bcl-2 gene rearrangements that occurred near or within the minor breakpoint cluster region. These ten patients had a rearranged JH-containing fragment that migrated with the rearranged bcl-2 fragment. In the other 20 patients, these two chromosome 18-specific DNA probes did not detect the bcl-2 rearrangements. Compared with studies performed in the United States, the statistical analysis indicates a significant difference in frequency of the bcl-2 gene rearrangements near or within the major breakpoint cluster region (P = 0.0027) and the minor breakpoint cluster region (P = 0.029). However, the distribution difference of these events was not significant.\r"

  ".U": "89135013\r", 
  ".W": "In the human promyelocytic cell line HL60, we observed both a strong procoagulant activity (PCA) on the cell membrane and proteolytic activity in the lysate of these cells. Because these cell-line cells are susceptible to differentiation to either a more mature granulocytic or monocytic form, we were able to study the hypothesis that the combination of PCA and proteolytic activity is confined to the promyelocyte. This may explain the severe coagulopathy seen in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Cell differentiation in a myeloid direction induced by retinoic acid or DMSO led to a diminished PCA, while not affecting the fibrinolytic activity. On the other hand, monocytic differentiation obtained by culturing the cells in the presence of 1; 25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 led to the complete disappearance of the proteolytic activity of the cell lysate, although the procoagulant activity was still present. Furthermore, we found that the elastase activity almost disappeared after monocytic differentiation. We also studied the PCA, proteolytic activity, and elastase activity of blast cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Only in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia did we observe both a strong PCA and fibrinolytic activity. This supports our hypothesis that the combination of these activities is unique to the promyelocyte and may explain the observed bleeding complications in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.\r"

For most restriction enzymes, this locus has been found to be nonpolymorphic. Two alleles have only been found when Taql-digested DNA is hybridized to a 5' bcr-specific probe. We describe another two-allele polymorphism detected by the same probe in PvuII-digested DNA. The polymorphism is characterized by an additional PvuII site in the bcr region: this causes the appearance of an additional band of about 2.3 kb or 2.5 kb besides a 4.8-kb fragment in hybridizations with the 5' bcr or a 3' bcr probe. The incidence of the second allele is very low. It has only been found in some patients with hematopoietic malignancies and in a group of volunteers having a leukemia patient in their families.\r"

  ".U": "89135017\r", 
  ".W": "The first monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to epitopes in the extracellular domain of the human c-fms proto-oncogene product (receptor for the macrophage colony stimulating factor, CSF-1) were used with flow cytometric techniques to study receptor expression on normal human peripheral blood monocytes, bone marrow cells, and leukemic blasts. On normal cells CSF-1 receptors were restricted in their expression to cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage. CSF-1 receptors were detected on leukemic blasts from 15 (30%) of 50 children with acute myeloid leukemia, compared with four (15%) of 26 adults. By contrast, detectable CSF-1 receptors were uniformly absent on blasts from 19 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CSF-1 receptors on normal monocytes and myeloid leukemia cells could be induced to downmodulate by incubation with either human recombinant CSF-1 or phorbol esters, confirming that the receptors had functional ligand-binding sites and responded to transmodulation by inducers of protein kinase C. The numbers of receptors per cell and the percentage of positive cases were highest for leukemic blasts with cytochemical and morphological features of monocytes. However, CSF-1 receptors were also detected on a subset of leukemic blast cells with features of granulocytic differentiation (FAB subtypes M1 through M3). Southern blotting analyses of DNA from 47 cases of acute myeloid leukemia demonstrated no rearrangements within the 32 kb of genomic sequences that contain CSF-1 receptor coding exons or in the 50 kb upstream of the first coding exon. Analysis of the upstream region of the c-fms locus revealed that sequences representing the terminal 112 untranslated nucleotides of c-fms mRNA map 26 kb 5' to the first coding exon, suggesting that at least one c-fms promoter is separated from the receptor coding sequences by a very long intron. Whereas expression of the CSF-1 receptor in myeloid leukemic blasts is not restricted to cells with monocytic characteristics, the apparently aberrant pattern of receptor synthesis in a subset of cases with granulocytic features appears not to be due to chromosomal rearrangements within 50 kb upstream of sequences encoding the receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Based on the recent reports that recombinant human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) accelerates the rate of engraftment in a variety of autologous bone marrow transplantation settings, we have investigated its effects on hematopoietic recovery of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation. Our studies, which involved 25 autologous ALL recipients who received rhGM-CSF and 27 controls similar for disease status (remission or relapse) and disease type (B- or T-lineage) differed from previous studies in one important aspect: the bone marrows were purged with 4-hydroperoxcyclophosphamide (4HC) and anti-T or anti-B-cell lineage-specific antibodies before transplantation. Such treatments frequently lead to a reduction in the CFU-GM content of the transplanted marrow. Eighteen of 25 patients completed the entire course of rhGM-CSF. Of the 16 patients who received greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/M2/d for at least eight days, there were five patients who had an apparent rhGM-CSF response and 11 patients who did not respond. Of the parameters analyzed, only the number of CFU-GM progenitor cells infused per kilogram was significantly associated with an rhGM-CSF response. All patients receiving greater than or equal to 1.2 x 10(4) CFU-GM progenitors per kilogram achieved an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,000/microL by day 21 and had a greater than 50% decrement in ANC within 48 to 72 hours of discontinuing rhGM-CSF, as contrasted to none of the patients receiving less than or equal to 7.2 x 10(3) CFU-GM progenitors per kilogram.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These rates were all significantly greater than published rates for the general population. The differences persisted after analysing separately by age group.

  ".W": "To determine whether anthropometric techniques widely used for assessment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) would be useful outcome measures in long-term clinical trials, 52 AS patients at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases were studied. All patients had well documented AS with a mean age of 38.1 years, and had been diagnosed for an average of 7.6 years. Measurements were taken before (B) and after (A) 3-week intensive inpatient physical therapy (PT). Short-term therapeutic effects (over 3 weeks) were significant (adjusted p less than 0.0001) for all five measures tested (chest expansion, finger-to-floor distance, height, lumbar flexion, and cervical rotation). Height (adjusted p less than 0.0001), finger-to-floor distance (adjusted p = 0.047) and cervical rotation (adjusted p = 0.012) diminished over the course of follow-up. Therefore, 3 weeks of hospitalization with intensive physical therapy produces measurable short-term change; minute but measurable change with treatment occurs even in long-standing AS; and detectable changes in physical measurements occur over a 5-year period even in long-standing AS. Anthropometric measurements are useful outcome variables for long-term clinical trials in AS, but the potential for improvement in clinical measurements in long-standing AS is predictably small.\r"

  ".W": "When prophylactic antibiotics are used in abdominal surgery it is customary to give the first dose before the operation. Whilst intra-operative antibiotics may be effective in elective surgery, there may be an advantage to starting pre-operatively when there is already an infective focus such as appendicitis. Antibiotics started pre-operatively (group P) have been compared with antibiotics started after initial abdominal exploration (group T). Three intravenous doses of 500 mg metronidazole plus 1 g cephazolin were given in a randomized, double-blind study of 700 emergency and elective high-risk abdominal operations. Antibiotic plasma concentrations at the end of the operation were significantly lower in group P but lay well within the therapeutic range. Wound infection rates, which included minor and delayed infections, were similar in both groups (group P, 57 of 342, 16.7 per cent; group T, 55 of 358, 15.4 per cent; 95 per cent confidence intervals for the difference being -4.1 to +6.7 per cent. In appendicitis, wound infection rates were 12.1 and 13.9 per cent for groups P and T respectively. However, non-fatal deep sepsis was more common in group P (nine cases) than in group T (two cases) (chi 2 = 4.9, P less than 0.05). Postoperative infection was twice as common in obese patients whose body mass index (BMI) was greater than or equal to 26 (39 of 132, 30 per cent) than in thin patients whose BMI was less than 24 (41 of 288, 14 per cent; chi 2 = 13.8, P less than 0.001). This study failed to show any advantage to starting antibiotics pre-operatively, even in appendicitis.\r"

Recent results have suggested that the advantage of vein over prosthesis is more pronounced in a distal situation, but it is not immediately apparent whether the difference is sufficient to justify a policy of using prosthesis for the initial above-knee graft to preserve the vein in case later surgery is required. An attempt has been made to answer this question. The literature has been reviewed to obtain estimates of the patency rates for grafts in different situations and a mathematical model has been set up using these figures to predict the outcome of different treatment policies. The model can be used to predict the result of alteration or inaccuracy in the data or to make use of the results of newly reported studies. The model predicts that the use of prosthesis for an initial graft will reduce the overall patency and substantially increase the requirement for reoperation, even if the present data give a substantial overestimate of the advantages of vein above the knee.\r"

Assessment by 24 h pH monitoring and manometry between 3 and 6 months after operation showed that both procedures were equally effective in reducing reflux and increasing lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. However, long-term endoscopic follow-up revealed grade III oesophagitis in seven patients in the Angelchik group. No patient in the fundoplication group had grade III oesophagitis. Three of eight patients with strictures in the Angelchik group reported persistent dysphagia. All seven patients with strictures in the Nissen group were relieved of their dysphagia. Migration or erosion of the prosthesis did not occur. Three prostheses (10 per cent) were removed, two for dysphagia and one because of sepsis.\r"

This review, however, shows that persistent impairment of recent memory has tended to occur only in cases where there has been concurrent extracallosal damage, particularly to the fornix and its connections. Both the timing and sensitivity of psychometric tests as well as the availability of preoperative baselines are all important factors in determining the reliability of memory assessment following callosal surgery. A minimal delay of one year between surgery and final memory testing is needed because intellectual functions have been shown to improve markedly during the 12 months following callosal section. The use of discriminating psychometric tests with comparisons before and after operation is desirable, since global memory tests are relatively insensitive to disorders of recent memory.\r"

The disease is probably inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, while there is a considerable female preponderance, the female-to-male ratio being 2:1. The disorder is distinguishable from various types of distal myopathy on the basis of clinical and pathological findings, and other myopathies with rimmed vacuole formation, including inclusion body myositis, from a prognostic viewpoint.\r"

  ".W": "In Parkinson's disease there is degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra, with consequent depletion of the neurotransmitter dopamine. The triad of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia is the clinical hallmark. Drugs currently used for palliative therapy fall into three categories: anticholinergic agents, dopamine precursors (levodopa combined with extracerebral decarboxylase inhibitors) and artificial dopamine agonists. It has been argued, on theoretical grounds, that some drugs slow the progress of Parkinson's disease, although no firm evidence has supported this. Treatment must be individualized, and more than one type of drug can be given concurrently after a careful build-up in dosage. We review the adverse effects of various drugs and consider new developments such as slow-release preparations, selective D-1 and D-2 agonists and transplants of dopaminergic cells into the brain. The treatment of Parkinson's disease can be demanding, rewarding and sometimes frustrating, but it remains a most challenging exercise in pharmacotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Cisplatin is a backbone of any combination chemotherapy currently in use for the treatment for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. Recently new platinum analogs with lower toxicity have been developed. The antitumor activity of two analogs, carboplatin (JM8) and iproplatin (JM9) was compared to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. The 3thymidine incorporation in three established human testicular cancer cell lines was significantly stronger inhibited by cisplatin than by JM8 or JM9. Cisplatin showed a significantly stronger antitumor activity against heterotransplanted human testicular cancer cell lines in the nude mouse than JM8 or JM9 when given at equitoxic doses. Although both analogs only moderately retarded the tumor growth, cisplatin produced a significant reduction of tumor volume in three of four cell lines. From these data it is concluded that the antitumor activity of cisplatin may be significantly superior to JM8 and JM9, and results of preclinical investigations should be awaited before replacement of cisplatin by JM8 or JM9 in the treatment of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors can be considered.\r"

  ".W": "Mid-gut carcinoid tumors have been shown to produce substance P, a tachykinin. A recent addition to this family of peptides is neurokinin A which is cleaved from the same precursor as substance P; beta-pre-pro-tachykinin. The authors have examined mid-gut and pulmonary carcinoid tumors for the presence of the two tachykinins, using immunocytochemical study and radioimmunoassay, and have applied the techniques of in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis to investigate the expression of mRNA for beta-pre-pro-tachykinin. All gut tumors (n = 8) and three of the six lung tumors examined were found by immunocytochemical study to contain both tachykinins or neurokinin A alone. Chromatographic analysis of tumor extracts suggests that this peptide is being detected as a separate molecule and/or as the C-terminal portion of a larger, uncleaved form. Three of the cases positive for tachykinins showed no detectable serotonin immunoreactivity. Strong hybridization signals for beta-pre-pro-tachykinin mRNA were seen in all but one of the cases studied which contained tachykinin immunoreactivity. Intact mRNA and positive hybridization was found by Northern blot analysis in two mid-gut tumors. Concentrations of tachykinins were found by radioimmunoassay to be higher in mid-gut tumors (substance P 27.2 +/- 19.7 pmol/g; neurokinin A 31.8 +/- 24.2 pmol/g; mean +/- SEM, n = 5) than in lung cases (substance P mean 0.8, range 0.5-1.0 pmol/g; neurokinin A mean 11.0, range 10.0-12.0 pmol/g; n = 3). These results show that mid-gut and pulmonary carcinoid tumors produce tachykinins, which are detected, in some cases, where no serotonin immunoreactivity can be found, possibly because of a high rate of amine secretion. Screening for tachykinins may prove to be a useful diagnostic adjunct for these tumors.\r"

As a control, morphologically normal thyroid tissue from the same patient was used in each individual case of carcinoma. Although a marked variation may be observed between individual cases, each examined papillary thyroid carcinoma showed significantly greater activity of acid proteases, both per unit weight of wet thyroid tissue and per unit of lysosomal proteins, in comparison to the corresponding control (range, 24%-248%). In conclusion, it is suggested that enhanced proteolytic activity of lysosomal acid proteases in papillary carcinoma is probably a result of disturbance in catabolic degradation of the thyroglobulin molecule in malignantly transformed thyroid tissue.\r"

Mean plasma SRIF concentrations were significantly higher than those found in normal controls, with five of 15 patients having plasma SRIF levels above the mean + 2 SD of normal controls. High immunoreactive SRIF concentrations were found in the extract of three tumor tissues but not in one follicular thyroid cancer or in one toxic diffuse goiter. By immunoperoxidase staining seven of 11 (63.6%) primary MTC and five of 13 (38.5%) metastases expressed SRIF antigen in a low number of cells and with a weak degree of staining. As expected, CT was expressed in almost 100% of the cases with positivity in most of the cells and strong degree of staining. Patients with positive SRIF staining in the primary tumor had longer survival than SRIF negative patients. Infusion of synthetic SRIF (11 micrograms/minute/45 minutes) produced a significant reduction of plasma CT (but not CEA) levels in 12 of the 15 patients submitted to this test. Maximal percent decrease of plasma CT ranged from 10.8% to 72.7% of the basal value and was usually observed between 30 and 45 minutes from the beginning of the infusion. When infused together with the injection of PG, SRIF was able to significantly (P less than 0.05) inhibit the PG-induced CT release in five of six patients tested. These results demonstrate the following: SRIF is present in a few cells of many primary MTC and less frequently in their metastases; tentatively, the expression of SRIF antigen in the tumor seems to be associated with longer survival; increased SRIF concentrations are found in the plasma of some patients with metastatic involvement; and treatment with exogenous SRIF reduces the basal and PG-induced CT (but not CEA) release from the tumor.\r"

A histologic subtype of meningiomas was found which has not previously been described. In these \"sclerosing\" tumors only a small portion of the lesion contained viable cells, most of which bore little resemblance to conventional meningothelial cells. The bulk of the lesions consisted of whorling collagen bundles produced by the tumor. All cases in which there was tumor invasion of the brain fell into this category. The prognosis for the sclerosing meningiomas was similar to conventional meningiomas, casting doubt on the value of brain invasion as a marker of malignancy in childhood meningiomas. The recognition of this histologic type may aid diagnosis, guide surgical management, and possibly make postoperative radiotherapy unnecessary.\r"

Available evidence suggests that the mechanism of this synergism is a kinetic stabilization of complex formed between thymidylate synthase and fluorodeoxyuridylate that also involves a mole of the cofactor for the thymidylate synthase reaction, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. This effect results in an extended time of depletion of thymidine nucleotides with a resultant increased level of cell death. The biochemical aspects of this interaction are discussed and related to the therapeutics of this combination.\r"

  ".W": "The Mayo Clinic and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing five different combination chemotherapeutic regimens to single-agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), given by intravenous bolus technique (500 mg/m2 for 5 days) as a control, in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. This report summarizes the results of treatment in 208 patients who were randomized to 5-FU alone or 5-FU with leucovorin in either a high-dose (200 mg/m2) or a low-dose regimen (20 mg/m2) intravenously for 5 days. Both of the 5-FU with leucovorin regimens were associated with improved survival compared with single-agent 5-FU (P less than 0.03). The interval to tumor progression, measurable tumor response rates, and measures of quality of life (performance status, weight gain, and symptomatic relief) were also improved significantly with the addition of leucovorin. There was no therapeutic advantage associated with the use of high-dose compared with low-dose leucovorin. The dose-limiting toxicity of 5-FU/leucovorin was stomatitis. There was one treatment-related fatality (due to sepsis) among the 138 patient receiving 5-FU/leucovorin (0.7%). The most favorable regimen in this trial was 5-FU with low-dose leucovorin, based upon considerations of therapeutic effectiveness, toxicity, and cost. A national intergroup trial is being coordinated by the National Cancer Institute that will test the efficacy of low-dose leucovorin with 5-FU as one approach to adjuvant therapy after a curative surgical resection in selected patients with Dukes' Stage B2 or C colon cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Results from five completed and two ongoing Phase III trials comparing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with 5-FU and leucovorin (LV) for the treatment of advanced, previously untreated colorectal carcinoma are reviewed. In five of these studies, 5-FU/LV was shown to provide a significantly higher response rate than 5-FU alone. Partial response rates resulting from the combination ranged from 16% to 45%, while those obtained with 5-FU alone were 5% to 18%. Complete responses with either treatment occurred in 0% to 8% of the patients treated. In two of the studies, 5-FU treatment prolonged median survival by 3 and 6 months. The planned dose intensities (DI) for single-agent 5-FU ranged from 463 to 760 mg/m2/week, and the actual delivered DI, established in two of the trials, were 531 and 533 mg/m2/week. The planned 5-FU DI for the 5-FU/LV combination ranged from 463 to 600 mg/m2/week compared with the delivered DI of 461 and 463 mg/m2/week. When used with LV, 5-FU cannot be administered at the single-agent maximum tolerated dose because of unacceptable toxicity. Nevertheless, lower doses of 5-FU, when combined with LV, had higher response rates than 5-FU alone. Significant toxicity occurred with 5-FU and with the combination. The addition of LV to 5-FU changed the type of toxicity that resulted; that toxicity varied with the schedule followed. The real, but modest improvement that resulted from the combination of 5-FU with the metabolic modulator LV offers the possibility that the administration of 5-FU/LV in the adjuvant setting will prolong survival and increase the percentage of patients cured of their disease. Furthermore, other compounds that modulate the effects of 5-FU may be capable of providing additional therapeutic benefits.\r"

Based on this information, several controlled, but nonrandomized, clinical trials have examined the combination of 5-FU and leucovorin in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Although many of these trials are still ongoing, preliminary information suggests that leucovorin also potentiates 5-FU activity against breast carcinoma. However, to date, it has not been shown that leucovorin increases the therapeutic index of 5-FU in these patients. Continued testing of the role of leucovorin in combination chemotherapy for breast cancer appears warranted.\r"

During this time, the cells underwent a morphological transformation which has also been referred to by others as cell remodeling (Guo J-X, Jacobson SL, Brown DL: Cell Mot Cytoskeleton 1986;6:291-304). This results in a change in myocyte morphology from its typical in vivo cylindrical shape to one which is more pleiomorphic. Despite the long-term change in morphology, myocytes expressed for differing lengths of time several aspects of the adult phenotype as evidenced by the following: 1) maintenance of cylindrical shape and/or evident cross-striations for the first 24-48 hours in culture, 2) reappearance of cross-striations during the second week in culture, 3) little or no spontaneous contractility for the first 4 days in culture, 4) expression of only the V1 isoform of myosin for at least 7 days, and 5) altered myosin isoform expression in response to changes in environmental conditions. These factors taken together suggest that in culture the adult cardiac myocyte remains a highly differentiated cell (as opposed to possible dedifferentiation) and maintains many of its previous in vivo characteristics. Such highly differentiated adult cells should be suitable as an in vitro system for studying the direct cellular effects of factors which regulate growth and differentiation of the in vivo heart.\r"

Fetal sheep respond to hemorrhage with increases in plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and vasopressin concentrations and plasma renin activity, but little is known about the afferent limb of the reflex(es) controlling these responses. Fetal sheep between 128 and 133 days' gestation were chronically prepared with vascular catheters. Five fetal sheep were subjected to bilateral section of the cervical vagosympathetic trunks; six fetal sheep were not vagotomized. Four to six days after surgery, the fetuses were subjected to withdrawal of 10 ml of blood every 10 minutes for 2 hours (130 ml total). Vagotomized fetal sheep responded to the hemorrhage with a greater decrease in central venous pressure than the intact fetuses and a slower restitution of fluid to the vascular space (estimated to be 17% of the hemorrhage volume in 2 hours) than the intact fetuses (estimated to be 28% of the hemorrhage volume in 2 hours). Both groups of fetuses, however, responded to the hemorrhage with increases in fetal plasma ACTH, cortisol, and vasopressin concentrations and plasma renin activity that were not significantly different. A posteriori analysis of the data by correlation analysis revealed that the fetal ACTH, vasopressin, and renin responses to the hemorrhage were more highly correlated to the changes in fetal arterial pH than to changes in fetal mean arterial pressure or central venous pressure. The results suggest that the ACTH, vasopressin, and renin responses to hemorrhage in the fetus be mediated by chemoreceptors, not by cardiovascular mechanoreceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Inhibition of angiotensin II effect with saralasin (10 micrograms/kg/min) or angiotensin II production with captopril (2 mg/kg) lowered systemic resistance (Rs) by 14% and 34%, respectively (p less than 0.05), and raised pulmonary resistance (Rp) by 35% and 77%, respectively (p less than 0.05). Thirty minutes following captopril, the ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow (Qp/Qs) decreased from 3.31 +/- 0.18 to 2.15 +/- 0.18 (p less than 0.05) while total pulmonary flow fell from 7.15 +/- 0.38 to 5.92 +/- 0.34 l/min/M2 (p less than 0.05, n = 11). Systemic flow increased from 2.17 +/- 0.14 to 2.86 +/- 0.33 l/min/M2 (p less than 0.05) despite a reduction in left atrial pressure (17.3 +/- 1.0 vs. 13.0 +/- 1.7, p less than 0.01). Reinfusion of angiotensin II (0.02 micrograms/kg/min) into the central aorta after captopril returned the hemodynamics to baseline including a rise in Rs and fall in Rp. Exogenous angiotensin II alone (0.08 micrograms/kg/min) or a threefold stimulation in PRA with furosemide (2 mg/kg) caused little hemodynamic effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To delineate the three-dimensional structure and distribution of intercellular junctions, we analyzed serial ultrathin sections of canine myocardium with transmission electron microscopy and disaggregated myocytes with scanning electron microscopy. Morphometric analysis of left ventricular myocardium sectioned in three orthogonal planes revealed that 80% of total gap junctional membrane occurred in large, ribbon-like gap junctions oriented transversely at cell end processes. The remaining 20% of gap junctional membrane was contained in small gap junctions located within plicate segments (interdigitating regions of cell-to-cell adhesion) of intercalated disks. In serial ultrathin sections, all gap junctions were contiguous with plicate segments. Thus, true \"lateral\" gap junctions do not exist in working ventricular myocytes and would not likely be able to withstand shear forces created by laterally sliding cells. Examination of serial plastic sections with light microscopy revealed complex overlapping of myocytes such that individual myocytes were connected at intercalated disks to an average of 9.1 +/- 2.2 other myocytes. These observations provide an improved understanding of the extent and distribution of cell junctions and should facilitate experimental and model studies of conduction in myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "To discover the underlying mechanisms involved in the beneficial long-term effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, we investigated the systemic and peripheral effects of short- and long-term ACE inhibition in patients with chronic heart failure. After assessing the short-term effects and dose titration with cilazapril, a new long-acting ACE inhibitor, 21 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or the ACE inhibitor. Seventeen patients completed the 3-month treatment. Central hemodynamic output, femoral blood flow (measured by thermodilution), oxygen saturation, and lactate and norepinephrine levels were determined simultaneously in the femoral vein and radial artery during treatment and after a 3-month rest and during symptom-limited bicycle exercise. Short-term ACE inhibition improved rest and exercise hemodynamic output, but it did not alter peak femoral blood flow, calculated leg oxygen consumption, or systemic oxygen uptake during exercise, despite significant reduction in femoral norepinephrine extraction and arterial angiotensin levels during exercise. In contrast, long-term ACE inhibition further improved exercise cardiac output and increased leg blood flow (from 2.3 to 2.9 l/min, p less than 0.05), leg oxygen consumption (from 277 to 403 ml/min, p less than 0.05), and systemic oxygen uptake (from 1,133 to 1,453 ml/min, p less than 0.05), whereas these variables remained unchanged with placebo treatment (p less than 0.02 between groups). Moreover, a moderate but significant increase in femoral oxygen extraction occurred after long-term therapy (ACE inhibitor: from 76% to 83%, p less than 0.05; placebo: from 75% to 74%, NS; p less than 0.01 between groups). We conclude that long-term ACE inhibition is clinically beneficial in that it improves blood flow to skeletal muscle during exercise over time. The long-term effects of ACE inhibition are, in part, probably related to peripheral (vascular) mechanisms, for example, by reversing the inability of peripheral vessels to dilate and by improving oxygen utilization.\r"

Therefore, the in-hospital and 1-year prognosis was investigated in a sufficiently large patient population (n = 2,024) to allow stratification by subgroups, in particular by age and previous myocardial infarction. Patients with non-Q wave infarction (n = 444; 22% of the total study population) were somewhat older (65 vs. 63 years, p less than 0.001) and had an increased incidence of previous myocardial infarction (46% vs. 24%, p less than 0.001) and congestive heart failure (21% vs. 8%, p less than 0.001) than patients with Q wave infarction. In-hospital mortality of patients with non-Q wave infarction was lower (8.1% vs. 11.5%; p less than 0.06), whereas their 1-year mortality after hospital discharge was significantly higher (13.7% vs. 9.2%, p less than 0.05) than for patients with Q wave infarction. However, total mortalities at 1 year were nearly equal. When patients were subgrouped by presence or absence of a previous myocardial infarction, patients in both subgroups exhibited mortality patterns typical of the entire population with Q wave or non-Q wave infarction. However, when stratified by age and previous infarction, in-hospital mortality for patients with non-Q wave infarction was significantly lower only in patients older than 70 years of age. Similarly, the higher mortality after hospital discharge in patients with non-Q wave infarction occurred only in patients older than 70 years of age without previous myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89136166\r", 
  ".W": "Acute ST segment elevation is regarded generally as the sine qua non of evolving Q wave myocardial infarction (MI) because such electrocardiographic (ECG) injury is believed to be a marker of transmural ischemia and a forerunner of transmural necrosis. Alternatively, ST segment depression with or without T wave inversion is viewed as the dominant ECG feature of non-Q wave MI. However, this hypothesis has not been assessed prospectively in an acute MI population. We analyzed 2,304 serial ECGs at study entry (admission), day 2, day 3, and predischarge (mean, 10.2 +/- 2 days) from 576 patients with creatine kinase MB confirmed acute non-Q wave MI to determine what percentage of patients with early ST segment elevation culminated in subsequent Q wave development. Of this group, 187 patients (32%) exhibited 1 mm or greater ST segment elevation in two or more contiguous entry ECG leads. Of those patients whose non-Q wave MI could be localized on the basis of diagnostic admission ST segment shifts, the prevalence of early ST segment elevation was 43% (187 of 439). The sum total mean (+/- SD) peak ST segment elevation by lead group (anterior, inferior, lateral) was 4.0 +/- 2.4, 4.5 +/- 2.4, and 2.5 +/- 0.6 mm, respectively. Despite this, only 20% of patients with ST segment elevation (37 of 187) developed Q waves. Of 252 patients who exhibited early ST segment depression or T wave inversion or both, 39 (15%) evolved subsequent Q waves. Thus, while the prevalence of early ST segment elevation in acute evolving non-Q wave MI was higher than previously reported, 80% of patients with and 85% of patients without ST segment elevation and absent Q waves on the admission ECG did not develop subsequent Q waves during a 2-week period of observation (p = NS). In addition, when patients with ST segment elevation were compared with patients with ST segment depression or T wave inversions or both, there were no between-group differences in log peak creatine kinase (404 vs. 383 IU), reinfarction (6% vs. 8%), postinfarction angina (50% vs. 42%), or early recurrent ischemia (49% vs. 45%), defined as postinfarction angina with transient ECG changes. Thus, in patients who present with initial acute non-Q wave MI, ST segment shifts on admission are unreliable predictors of subsequent Q wave evolution and do not discriminate significant differences in postinfarction outcome. In particular, ST segment elevation during the early hours of evolving infarction is not an invariable harbinger of subsequent Q wave development.\r"

Patients were treated with metoprolol (200 mg b.i.d.) or placebo for 1 week and then received the alternate therapy. Two days before the end of each treatment period, platelet aggregability was studied for 24 hours, and a 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram was obtained. Compared with placebo, metoprolol significantly decreased the total number (from 26 to 4, p less than 0.1) and duration (from 735 to 84 minutes, p less than 0.01) of silent ischemic episodes. This decrease was accompanied by a decrease in the mean blood pressure (from 127/81 to 118/71 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and the mean heart rate (from 70 to 54 beats/min, p less than 0.01). The incidence of silent ischemic episodes in the morning was significantly higher in untreated patients than in treated patients. The few episodes observed during metoprolol treatment occurred at the same time as the peak incidence observed during placebo treatment. During placebo treatment, platelet aggregability increased from 6:00 to 9:00 AM as reflected by a decrease in the threshold concentrations of ADP and epinephrine required to induce biphasic platelet aggregation (from 4.8 +/- 0.8 to 2.6 +/- 0.4 microM, p less than 0.02; and from 7.3 +/- 2.3 to 1.8 +/- 0.9 microM, respectively, p less than 0.02).

During 1 year (1985-1986), 12 of our current transplant population (total, 189) developed moderate or large pericardial effusions confirmed by two-dimensional echocardiography. These effusions occurred within 1 month of transplantation in 10 patients and at 3 months and 4.5 years in the other two. Pericardiocentesis was performed because of clinical evidence of increasing effusions in eight patients, with demonstrable hemodynamic compromise secondary to tamponade in five. Pericardial fluid was sterile in all but one. Endomyocardial biopsy at the time of increasing effusion revealed moderate acute rejection in five patients, mild rejection in three, and no rejection in four. All three patients with mild rejection had moderate acute rejection on subsequent biopsy performed within 7 days. In two of the four with no rejection, repeat biopsy within 5 days showed moderate acute rejection; in a third, moderate rejection was present on biopsy performed 14 days later. Legionella dumoffii was isolated from the pericardial fluid of the fourth patient, whose subsequent biopsies never showed rejection. Three of the 12 patients developed progressive ventricular dysfunction sufficiently severe to require retransplantation. One patient died suddenly 12 months after transplantation, and autopsy examination revealed severe coronary artery disease. Two died of sepsis within 3 months of transplantation.

Anatomic studies have demonstrated the existence of a periodontoidal vascular plexus that drains the posterior superior pharyngeal region. No lymph nodes are present in this plexus, so septic exudates may be freely transferred from the pharynx to the C1-C2 articulation. The resulting synovial and vascular engorgements may cause mechanical and chemical damage to the transverse and facet capsular ligaments leading to subluxation. The primary treatment of Grisel's syndrome is medical: the underlying infectious organism must be isolated and appropriate antibiotics prescribed. The subluxation is reduced in halter or skeletal traction. The authors use the classification scheme of rotary subluxation proposed by Fielding, so that treatment appropriate to the specific type of subluxation is used. Based on biomechanical data predicting articular instability and canal compromise proportional to the extent of ligamentous injury, the following specific forms of immobilization are recommended to ensure ligamentous healing: Fielding Type I (transverse ligament intact and bilateral facet capsular injury) soft collar; Type II (transverse ligament and unilateral facet capsular injury) Philadelphia collar or SOMI brace; and Type III (transverse ligament and bilateral facet capsular ligament injury) halo. Following six to eight weeks of immobilization, stability is assessed by the study of flexion-extension roentgenograms. Should residual instability be demonstrated, arthrodesis is indicated.\r"

Histologic evaluation employed a quantitative analysis of static and dynamic parameters of bone turnover on undecalcified sections. Extensive statistical analysis comparing roentgenographic with histologic parameters of bone quality showed: (1) no relationship of the two roentgenographic indices to trabecular bone volume and most other histologic parameters and (2) a high incidence of bone abnormalities. Bone quality is an imprecise term and is inadequately measured by these roentgenographic indices. Histologic measurement offers a more precise means of analyzing the relationship of the bone environment to the performance of the THA.\r"

The bone-grafting procedures were performed at a mean of ten weeks following injury and at a mean of eight weeks following soft-tissue coverage. Ninety-six percent of the fractures had associated injuries with a mean injury severity score of 20.9. Seventy-nine percent of the fractures were classified as Grade III open fractures, and 40% had bone loss greater than 50% of the cortical circumference. Ninety-six percent of the fractures healed at a mean time of 43 weeks after injury. Segmental bone loss and soft-tissue injury requiring flap coverage were the best predictors of prolonged time to union. Comparison with a matched historical control group of tibial fractures not receiving early bone grafts revealed a mean reduction in time to union of 11.7 weeks (p = 0.03). The incidence of chronic osteomyelitis was 1.9%. These results are attributed to early and repeated aggressive debridement, immediate rigid external fixation, early soft-tissue coverage, and early posterolateral bone grafting. Recommendations include posterolateral cancellous bone grafting two weeks following wound closure by delayed primary closure, split-thickness skin graft, or local rotational myoplasty. A six-week delay following freely vascularized soft-tissue coverage prior to bone grafting is suggested.\r"

That there exist osteogenic precursors in association with the soft, fibrous tissue of the marrow stroma is well established. An osteogenic tissue comprised of cartilage and bone is formed when marrow or marrow cell suspensions are cultured in vivo within diffusion chambers. Bone with a functional marrow organ is formed when marrow or marrow cell suspensions are transplanted heterotopically, e.g., under the renal capsule. Cultures of marrow stromal fibroblasts are readily established in vitro from single-cell bone marrow suspensions. Such cultures do not demonstrate overt differentiation in an osteogenic direction in vitro. When transplanted in vivo, however, they differentiate to form cartilage and bone in diffusion chambers and bone with a functional marrow organ when transplanted heterotopically. Single-cell bone marrow suspensions can be cultured in vitro under conditions that facilitate the formation of stromal fibroblast colonies. Circumstantial evidence supports the conclusion that each colony is derived from a single initiating cell termed a colony-forming unit-fibroblastic (CFU-F). A proportion of CFU-F demonstrates extensive proliferative potential both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro the extensive proliferative potential of a subset of CFU-F has been shown to be associated with a capacity for extensive self-renewal. On transplantation in vivo, the progeny of a proportion of CFU-F has been shown to be capable of proliferating and differentiating into all the stromal cell lines necessary for the formation of bone and reconstitution of the hematopoietic inductive microenvironment. These findings provide strong circumstantial evidence to support the hypothesis that there are stem cells present within the marrow stroma that are capable of giving rise to cells of a number of different lineages, including those of the osteogenic lineage (chondroblasts and osteoblasts).\r"

Each of the porphyrias has a specific enzyme defect in the pathway of heme biosynthesis that explains the pattern of biochemical abnormalities that occur. However, some patients have the enzyme defect but do not have clinical or biochemical manifestations, indicating that other factors (e.g., demand for increased heme biosynthesis) are also important in causing disease expression. The major clinical manifestations are neurologic dysfunction and photosensitivity. The precise cause of the neurologic dysfunction has not been defined, but the likely possibilities are overproduction of delta-aminolevulinic acid, which may act as a neurotoxin, or a deficiency of heme (or both). The cutaneous lesions in the porphyrias are due to the photo-sensitizing and other effects of porphyrins that are deposited in the skin or are circulating in dermal blood vessels. Therapy is directed to modify the biochemical abnormalities. Most importantly, intravenous administration of hematin is used in the treatment of acute attacks of neurologic dysfunction. Prevention remains a cornerstone in management of patients with porphyria, and those with gene defects should be counseled regarding factors that precipitate acute attacks.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying the unique GH secretory apparatus of the androgen-resistant testicular feminized (Tfm) rat we employed a reverse hemolytic plaque assay to assess GH secretion by individual cells from normal male, normal female, and Tfm rats. Acutely dispersed pituitary cells were incubated for 90 min with GH anti-serum in the presence of medium alone, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 nM GHRH, or 3 microM forskolin after which hemolytic plaques were developed over an additional 30 min. Body weights of the Tfm rats [318 +/- 7 g (mean +/- SEM)] were intermediate between intact males (372 +/- 18 g) and females (218 +/- 7 g). The total number of cells recovered from dispersion of Tfm rat pituitaries [3.20 +/- 0.42 X 10(6) (mean +/- SEM)] was greater than that from males (1.43 +/- 0.12 X 10(6); P = 0.001), but not distinguishable from that from females (2.31 +/- 0.30 X 10(6); P = 0.06). However, the absolute population of recovered somatotropes from the Tfm animals (1.24 +/- 0.22 X 10(6) exceeded both male (0.56 +/- 0.10 X 10(6); P = 0.002) and female (0.80 +/- 0.14 X 10(6); P = 0.046) values. Mean basal and maximal GH plaque areas were greater for cells from male rats than for those from either female or Tfm rats (P less than 0.05) regardless of whether GHRH or forskolin was used as the secretagogue. Plaque areas from female and Tfm cells were indistinguishable under all study conditions. These data suggest that a deficiency of androgen receptors prevents establishment of the greater GH secretory capacity of individual somatotropes characteristic of the adult male rat. This androgen receptor-dependent modulation of GH secretory capacity appears to occur at a step distal to the GHRH receptor. The data also suggest that an increase in the absolute population of somatotropes is an additional consequence of androgen receptor deficiency. This combination of individual somatotropes, each possessing a GH secretory capacity similar to that of cells from normal females, but present in greater absolute numbers, may explain the intermediate values found during previous studies of the Tfm rat GH axis which were based on assessment of large mixed populations of pituitary cells.\r"

  ".U": "89136883\r", 
  ".W": "An in vivo isolated pituitary paradigm was used to examine the extent to which negative feedback actions of testicular hormones are exerted directly at the level of the anterior pituitary gland. Hypophysectomized male rats received single anterior pituitary transplants under the kidney capsule. On the next day each hypophysectomized, graft-bearing (H/G) animal was fitted with a concentric atrial catheter system which allowed for intermittent infusions of LHRH (250 ng/5 min.h) and chronic blood sampling. On the fifth or sixth day of infusions, blood samples were obtained 2 h before sham-castration (n = 6) or castration (n = 5) and at every 2-h interval for 24 h thereafter. For comparison, blood samples were similarly obtained from a group of normal pituitary-intact male rats before and after sham-castration (n = 5) or castration (n = 5). Plasma LH and PRL levels in all animals were determined by RIA. In the H/G sham-castrate rats, LH levels remained constant throughout the 24-h postsurgery period. By contrast, plasma LH concentrations in the H/G castrate rats increased steadily for 18 h, reaching a plateau at levels 2- to 3-fold higher than pretreatment values. The absolute amounts of immunoreactive LH, and the trajectory of the LH rise in the H/G castrates closely resembled those in the normal castrates during the initial 20 h after castration; at subsequent time points, however, these similarities were not apparent, as LH levels in normal castrates continued to rise, while those in H/G castrates did not. PRL levels were not significantly different in H/G rats compared to those in their pituitary-intact counterparts. We conclude from these studies that most of the acute (less than 20 h) effects of castration on LH secretion can be accounted for by pituitary escape from direct negative feedback suppression. At longer times after orchidectomy, however, the continued postcastration rise in LH secretion may increasingly depend upon additional hypothalamic input. It is hypothesized that this added input consists of an acceleration of LHRH pulse frequency.\r"

  ".U": "89136886\r", 
  ".W": "We have used a variety of selective radioligands to identify and localize sigma- and phencyclidine (PCP)-binding sites in rat endocrine organs. [3H]Haloperidol-labeled sigma-receptors were identified in membrane homogenates of rat pituitary, adrenal, testis, and ovary which had kinetic and pharmacological characteristics similar to those of the well characterized sigma-receptors in rat cerebellum. The highest density of sigma-receptors was present in the ovary, with progressively lower densities present in the testis, pituitary, adrenal, and cerebellum, respectively. In autoradiographic studies, sigma-receptors [labeled with d-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)N-(1-propyl-2,3-[3H]piperidine or [3H]1,3-di-(2-tolyl)guanidine] were discretely localized within the endocrine tissues. In the pituitary, the highest density of sigma-receptors was found in the anterior lobe. In the adrenal, sigma-receptors were localized primarily in the cortex. In the testis, sigma-receptors were present in highest concentrations in the ductuli efferentes and ductus epididymis; lower densities of binding sites were present in the seminiferous tubules, and no binding was seen in the interstitial tissue. In the ovary, sigma-receptors were localized in high density in the maturing follicles, and lower densities were present in resting follicles. After hypophysectomy, there were relative increases in the densities of sigma receptors in the remaining tissue in the adrenal gland and testis. In contrast, hypophysectomy resulted in a marked depletion of sigma-binding sites in the ovary. The data from hypophysectomized rats indicate that the highest densities of sigma-receptors in the ovary are localized to (LH-dependent) maturing follicles, while sigma-binding sites in adrenal and testis are localized to cells that are not dependent on trophic maintenance by the pituitary. In contrast, high affinity PCP receptors were not detected in pituitary, adrenal, testis, or ovary either by homogenate binding studies with 3,4-[3H]N-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine or in vitro autoradiography using 3,4-[3H]N-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine and d-[3H]5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-[a,d] + cyclohepten-5,10-imine. In summary, the data suggest that the reported endocrine effects of PCP and the prototypic sigma-receptor agonist N-allylnormetazocine are probably mediated either through direct action on sigma-receptors in the pituitary and/or target endocrine organs or by actions on sigma- and/or PCP receptors in brain.\r"

The effects of PTH on bone formation could be mediated by local regulators, either by altering their binding to receptors or by modulating their synthesis. Cell extracts from PTH-treated osteoblast-enriched cultures isolated from fetal rat parietal bones were examined by Northern blot analysis for changes in mRNAs encoding insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), transforming growth factor-beta, and beta 2-microglobulin. PTH did not influence transforming growth factor-beta or beta 2-microglobulin transcript levels. In contrast, PTH-(1-34) had a biphasic stimulatory effect on IGF-I transcript levels; 0.1-10 nM PTH increased IGF-I transcripts by 100-200% after a 6-h treatment, while 100 nM PTH induced a 100% increase. In addition, PTH at 0.01-10 nM increased immunoreactive IGF-I (iIGF-I) in culture medium by 40-200% at 24 h. Maximal increases in IGF-I transcripts occurred at 6 h, while iIGF-I accumulated throughout 24 h of culture. These results are compared to the effects of 0.5-50 nM GH, which increased IGF-I transcripts by 30% and iIGF-I by 50-100%. Therefore, PTH enhanced local IGF-I synthesis by increasing IGF-I transcripts, and this effect may in part mediate the anabolic actions of PTH on bone.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous administration of small doses of beta-endorphin causes immediate suppression of basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in normal rabbits. The purpose of the present study was to determine if beta-endorphin directly inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from rabbit pancreatic islets. Islets were isolated from male New Zealand White rabbits and perifused for 1 h with medium containing 100 mg/dl glucose (M100) followed by a 1-h challenge with medium containing 300 mg/dl glucose (M300) with or without beta-endorphin and/or the specific opioid antagonist naloxone. Samples were collected every 5 min during the last 30 min of the baseline perifusion with M100 and during the 1-h challenge with the stimulatory concentration of glucose (M300). Total insulin secretion for each 1-h period was calculated by adding the areas under the curves for twice the 30-min baseline period and for the 1-h challenge period. The mean +/- SE area for the control islets during perifusion with M100 was 5.9 +/- 0.8 microU/islet.h. M300 stimulated a 4.2-fold increase in the amount of insulin secreted (24.5 +/- 3.6 microU/islet.h). The stimulated rate of insulin release was sustained throughout the 1-h test period with M300, averaging 0.42 +/- 0.02 microU insulin/islet.min. beta-Endorphin inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximal suppression of insulin secretion to a level well below the baseline secretion rate was produced by 300 nM beta-endorphin (1.9 +/- 0.3 microU/islet.h). The first 15 min of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was 6 times less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of beta-endorphin than was the next 45 min. The concentrations of beta-endorphin causing 50% inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (IC50) for the 5- to 15-, 20- to 60-, and 5- to 60-min intervals were 1.96, 0.35, and 0.57 nM, respectively. Naloxone (3 microM) had no effect on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but partially antagonized the inhibitory effect of 30 nM beta-endorphin (10.2 +/- 2.9 microU/islet.h naloxone plus beta-endorphin vs. 2.6 +/- 1.1 microU/islet.h beta-endorphin; P less than 0.05). These data demonstrate that beta-endorphin, at low concentrations, has a direct inhibitory effect on insulin secretion, and they support the idea that a naloxone-sensitive beta-endorphin-binding component is present in pancreatic islets.\r"

Comparing areas under glucose curves among the intact rats, those receiving somatostatin with insulin infusion, ADX rats, and ADX rats receiving somatostatin with insulin infusion, the area under the glucose curve was intact rats greater than intact rats receiving somatostatin with insulin infusion greater than ADX rats receiving somatostatin with insulin infusion greater than ADX rats. These results suggest that there are three distinct sympathetic nervous system responses to 2-DG-induced central nervous system-mediated hyperglycemia. 2-DG-induced hyperglycemia is not dependent on only one of those three systems, it is dependent on all of them. The relative potency of the factors to 2-DG-induced hyperglycemia increases in the following order: direct neural innervation of liver (including suppressive epinephrine action on insulin secretion), glucagon, and direct epinephrine action on liver.\r"

  ".U": "89136903\r", 
  ".W": "The ruminant corpus luteum synthesizes and secretes oxytocin, but little is known of the regulation of these processes in the ovary. In the present work we describe a method for the preparation of cells from the early bovine corpus luteum (1-5 days postovulation) and their maintenance in serum-free culture. The release of oxytocin and progesterone from these cells was increased by the addition of insulin or insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), but not by IGF-II. Hormone release (measured between 60 and 84 h of culture) was increased approximately 5-fold (oxytocin) and 2.5-fold (progesterone) by maximally effective concentrations of IGF-I (EC50, 0.27 nM) and insulin (EC50, 1.94 nM). Sustained exposure (0-84 h) to prostaglandins (PGs) caused a dose-dependent reduction in oxytocin release in the presence of IGF-I (PGF2 alpha EC50, 31 nM; rank order of potency, PGF2 alpha greater than PGE2 greater than PGE1), but did not markedly reduce progesterone release. The inhibitory effect of PG on oxytocin production was mimicked by sustained exposure to a protein kinase-C activator (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate), supporting the proposed role for this enzyme as a mediator of PG action. These data provide the first demonstration that oxytocin release from early bovine corpus luteal cell cultures can be regulated by insulin, IGF-I, and PGs. Since granulosa and/or luteal cells produce and respond to IGF-I and PGF2 alpha, our data indicate functional interaction of these compounds in the regulation of luteal cell activity.\r"

Encouraged by these studies carried out mostly so far in human subjects, we decided to investigate if prorenin- and renin-like activities could be demonstrated in the follicular fluid obtained from bovine ovaries. The results obtained in this study show that in a total of 58 follicles examined, significant quantities of both prorenin- and renin-like activities could be demonstrated. The prorenin-like activity measured was invariably 30-40 times greater than the renin-like activity in the follicular fluid samples. There was an inverse relationship between the ratio of estradiol to progesterone concentrations and prorenin-like activity in the follicular fluid. Similarly, a significant negative correlation was seen between the estradiol concentration and prorenin-like activity in follicular fluid. On the other hand, there was no discernible relationship between androstendione concentrations and prorenin-like activity. With respect to progesterone, in large follicles with high (greater than 50 ng/ml) progesterone content, the prorenin-like activity was 3 times as high as that in the low (less than 50 ng/ml) progesterone group. There was, however, no difference in the levels of prorenin-like activity between the high and low progesterone groups in the case of small follicles. Furthermore, analysis of the contents of prorenin- and renin-like activities in extract prepared from granulosa and thecal cells revealed thecal cells of bovine ovarian follicles to be a major source of the enzyme activities. The ratio of prorenin to renin activity in thecal cell extract was close to 1. By analyzing the relationship between various steroid concentrations and prorenin-like activity in follicular fluid, it appears that the atretic follicles are likely to have significantly higher levels of prorenin-like activity in their fluid.\r"

  ".W": "Small cell aggregates of functional interstitial tissue were isolated from ovaries of 21- to 24-day-old rats, and their biochemical properties were studied in miniature cultures of 500-4000 cells. The isolated interstitial cells expressed high amounts of the mitochondrial cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450, visualized by immunofluorescent staining. Freshly isolated cells also expressed high activities of 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17:20-lyase, which were assayed by TLC analysis of [3H]progesterone metabolites. The TLC technique revealed the immediate conversion of progesterone to 5 alpha-reduced progestins. Consequently, no aromatizable androgens were produced but, accumulation of androsterone resulted instead from the direct action of 17 alpha-hydroxylase on 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnane-20-one (pregnanolone). Both the immunoreactive levels of cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 and the rate of the 17:20-lyase activity declined rapidly during culture. However, addition of LH to the medium restored both enzymes, indicating the presence of functional LH receptors. The latter were also demonstrable by their ability to evoke cAMP formation in response to LH, but not to FSH. The activity of 5 alpha-reductase in the interstitial cells was much higher (3-fold) than its activity in the granulosa cells. Unlike 17:20 lyase, the activity of 5 alpha-reductase did not decay in culture, nor was it affected by LH. We thus established a novel and sensitive experimental method to isolate and study a minute population of ovarian cells which, unlike the follicular granulosa and theca cells, are enigmatically differentiated at the early stages of ovarian development.\r"

  ".U": "89136931\r", 
  ".W": "This study aimed at a more detailed characterization of the mechanisms by which interleukin 1 (IL-1) inhibits insulin secretion. For this purpose, isolated rat pancreatic islets were kept in tissue culture for 5 days in medium RPMI 1640 plus 10% calf serum. The islets were subsequently transferred to the same culture medium containing various test substances plus 1% human serum with or without 25 U/ml human recombinant IL-1 beta. After a culture period of 48 h the islet structure was examined in the electron microscope and the islet function studied in short term incubations in the absence of IL-1. Islets exposed to IL-1 showed ultrastructural signs of degeneration in 10-20% of the B cells while such changes were not found in other types of islet cells. An increased number of secondary lysosomes and occasional myelin figures were observed in the B cells exposed to IL-1. These ultrastructural alterations were, however, reversed in islets cultured in cytokine-free medium for 6 days after the IL-1 treatment. In islets cultured in the presence of 11.1 mM glucose only, or 11.1 mM glucose plus 10 mM nicotinamide, 61 mM dimethyl area, 2 micrograms/ml indomethacin, 10 microM 4-bromophenacyl bromide or 10 microM nordihydroguaiaretic acid, 10 microM phenantroline, and 0.1 or 1.0 microgram/ml cyclosporin A, IL-1 reduced the insulin release by 64-85%. Culture at 5.6 mM glucose did not modify the IL-1-induced inhibition of insulin release, whereas a significant protective effect was observed at 28 or 56 mM glucose. The DNA content in IL-1-exposed islets cultured at 11.1 mM glucose was decreased by about 20% but not in islets cultured at other glucose concentrations. The D-[5-3H]glucose utilization at 16.7 mM glucose was unaffected by IL-1, whereas the oxidation of D-[6-14C]glucose was reduced by 50%. The present results suggest that IL-1-induced inhibition of insulin secretion is related to a disturbed mitochondrial function. This effect is not counteracted by a poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase inhibitor, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, an iron chelator, a T lymphocyte-specific immunosuppressive drug, or inhibitors of phospholipase A2 or inhibitors of prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis. Thus, IL-1-induced inhibition of insulin secretion seems not to be mediated by the same mechanisms as those causing alloxan- or streptozotocin-induced damage of B cells. Furthermore, the action of IL-1 does not appear to be mediated via arachidonic acid metabolism. Glucose affords some protection, probably by enhancing the B cell mitochondrial function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Islet mass and insulin secretory responses (both in vivo and in vitro) were assessed 19 days after a 40% pancreatectomy (Px) in 5-week-old rats. Plasma glucose and insulin values were unchanged by the 40% Px, both in the fed state and after ip glucose. Also, glucose potentiation of arginine-induced insulin secretion was fully intact when assessed with the in vitro perfused pancreas. Islet mass, assessed using point-counting morphometrics, was 84% of the sham value, not the expected 60%. In contrast, there was no compensatory change in acinar tissue, as judged by pancreatic weight. To determine if the insulin secretory reserve capacity was reduced after the 40% Px, dexamethasone was given on days 14-18. On day 18, the Px rats were midly hyperglycemic, but by the next day, glucose tolerance post-ip glucose was normal, and the insulin responses to the ip glucose in vivo and arginine in vitro were identical in the dexamethasone-treated Px and sham rats. These data show no discernible change in quantitative or qualitative B-cell secretory responses after 40% Px. A key mechanism contributing to this maintenance of normal function was regrowth of much of the excised islet tissue.\r"

Axons of these presumed dopaminergic neurons converge in the median eminence (ME) with Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH)-containing axons originating mostly from neurons situated in the medial preoptic area. Electron microscopic double labeling revealed synaptic contacts between TH-positive presynaptic profiles and LHRH-containing postsynaptic elements. Samples of ME, ARN, paraarcuate and lateral hypothalamus were dissected and incubated to assess LHRH release and tissue content. Only ME-LHRH release was significantly reduced in the presence of dopamine (DA). All other regions released equal amounts with and without DA. Thus, a presynaptic dopaminergic inhibition of LHRH-containing axons at the level of the ME might contribute to the regulation of LHRH release into the portal vessels.\r"

This increase in insulin requirements and plasma glucose from 0600 to 0900, when compared with midnight to 0600, has been termed the dawn phenomenon. We believe that the increased need for insulin in the morning has been misinterpreted. Data are reviewed that suggest the major perturbation overnight is a sleep-associated fall in hepatic glucose output, with a return to basal production rates on arousal in the morning. Moreover, the apparent increased insulin requirement for breakfast compared with lunch or supper (meal phenomenon) appears to be related more to lack of residual insulin effect from a preceding meal than to any putative morning insulin resistance. Thus, we found little evidence to support morning insulin resistance as a cause of either the dawn phenomenon (more appropriately designated the sleep phenomenon) or the meal phenomenon. A proper understanding of these phenomena is essential to the management of diabetic patients receiving insulin.\r"

To determine the effect of sleep with its associated lowered metabolic rate and thermogenesis on glucose kinetics and gluconeogenic substrate availability, 11 normal volunteers underwent an overnight study in which [3-3H]glucose was infused. Despite decreased insulin secretion, a fall in hepatic glucose output was observed with sleep that was synchronous with a reduction in glucose utilization and lipolysis (decreased plasma glycerol and free fatty acids). When activity was increased, these parameters rose toward previously reported basal levels. Prevention of sleep in 6 additional subjects attenuated the fall in glucose utilization and production as well as the fall in glycerol and free fatty acids despite similar insulin and counterregulatory hormone profiles. We suggest that sleep-associated metabolic changes produce a peripheral signal(s) that modulates hepatic glucose production in humans.\r"

When evaluated as a group, insulin binding to freshly isolated monocytes was 55% that of controls. Specific binding of insulin to skin fibroblasts in monolayer culture was 49% that of controls. Maximal insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation was only 27% that of controls. Individual data demonstrated that the diminished autophosphorylation activity was out of proportion to the diminished fibroblast insulin binding in cell lines from most subjects and was less than 50% of the predicted activity in 6 of the 12 studied cell lines. These data are consistent with genetically determined defects leading to diminished numbers of cell surface insulin receptors with intact tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation in many of our cell lines. However, in at least half, there appeared to be an additional defect beyond insulin binding, resulting in a disproportionate decrease in insulin-sensitive phosphorylation of the insulin-receptor beta-subunit.\r"

Our laboratory has reported that insulin-induced hyperpolarization (IIH) of rat skeletal muscle is not due to stimulation of a ouabain-inhibitable pump and that insulin decreases 42K efflux, apparently eliminating the first two candidate mechanisms. If the remaining hypothesis is correct, when Na+ is removed from the bathing solution, insulin should depolarize, not hyperpolarize. It did. With Tris or N-methyl-D-glucamine substituted for Na+, insulin depolarized by approximately 3 mV. Ouabain had no effect. PNa decreased by greater than 90%; PK was reduced by less than 40%. The main component of the immediate mechanism of IIH is the near elimination of PNa. Furthermore, when a poorly permeable cation was substituted for Na+, muscles hyperpolarized in the absence of insulin. This gave us an opportunity to test the hypothesis that hyperpolarization is a link in the insulin-transduction chain. Consistent with this hypothesis, rat muscles hyperpolarized in this manner in the absence of insulin took up more glucose than paired controls in normal Na+ solution.\r"

Insulin release in response to GLP-I-(7-37) is highly dependent on the ambient glucose concentration; no response is detectable at a glucose concentration of 2.8 mM, and at 6.6 and 16.7 mM, insulin release is augmented by 4.7 and 22.8 ng/ml, respectively. The pattern of insulin secretion stimulated by GLP-I-(7-37) is biphasic, with an initial spike followed by a plateau of sustained release. The effects on insulin release of GLP-I-(7-36) amide, a GLP-I analogue, and GLP-I-(7-37) at concentrations of 10(-11) M were indistinguishable. We also found that GLP-I-(7-37) at 10(-9) M does not influence glucagon secretion and that glucagonlike peptide II and the intervening peptide II, two other peptides encoded by the glucagon gene, have no detectable effects on insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo bioavailability, distribution, and metabolic fate of 125I-labeled insulin complexed to isologous and autologous antibodies were studied in inbred Lou/M rats. There was an impaired bioavailability of the 125I-insulin bound to the isologous and autologous antibodies. Very little of the 125I-insulin in these immune complexes could bind to insulin receptors on hepatocytes or renal tubular cells and be degraded, because the amounts of 125I from degraded 125I-insulin in the blood or secreted into the stomach were markedly attenuated in both cases for at least 30 min after injection. There was a simultaneous accumulation of 125I-insulin immune complexes in the liver and the kidneys of Lou/M rats injected with 125I-insulin complexed with isologous antibodies or when insulin-immunized Lou/M rats were injected with 125I-insulin during the same interval. The impaired bioavailability of immune-complexed insulin and altered distribution of radioactivity due to the accumulation of immune complexes in the liver and kidney were also observed in previous experiments in which Lewis rats were injected with xenogenic guinea pig and homologous insulin antibodies. These observations are therefore submitted as evidence that the Lou/M rat is a valid model in which to study the bioavailability of insulin immune complexed to isologous, homologous, and xenogenic antibodies and the metabolic fate of the respective insulin-antibody immune complexes.\r"

Lectin-purified insulin receptors were labeled with 125I-labeled NAPA-DP-insulin and autophosphorylated in the presence of 500 microM unlabeled ATP. Immunoprecipitation occurred in 43 +/- 8% of the autophosphorylated, 125I-labeled receptors from nondiabetic subjects with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies in contrast to 100% immunoprecipitation with anti-insulin-receptor antibodies. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies immunoprecipitated only 14 +/- 6% of NIDDM receptors (P less than .05 vs. nondiabetic receptors). A significant correlation existed between maximal insulin-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase activity and the proportion of receptors immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (r = .76, P less than .01). These results suggest that human adipocytes contain two distinct receptor populations, both of which bind insulin but only one of which is capable of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. In nondiabetic subjects, 40-50% of the receptors that bind insulin are capable of insulin-stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation. The proportion of receptors that bind insulin but are incapable of insulin-stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation is increased in NIDDM; the magnitude of this increase correlated with the magnitude of the decrease in kinase activity.\r"

Whether this is primarily due to a direct effect of endotoxin on the endothelium or is mediated by an action on the neutrophil is unclear. Canine neutrophils, isolated on plasma-Percoll gradients in vitro, were incubated with Salmonella enteriditis endotoxin, washed, and injected via wedged pulmonary arterial catheters into discrete lung zones of anesthetized dogs, whereas untreated neutrophils were administered into contralateral control lung zones. 113mIn-transferrin was administered intravenously 2 h before the animals were killed. Morphometry and extravascular protein accumulation were assessed at 4 h. Endotoxin treatment of neutrophils ex vivo induced a two- to three-fold increase in neutrophils in these lung zones (0.096 +/- 0.012 vs. 0.05 +/- 0.002 neutrophils/alveolar septal intercept, P less than 0.05). Extravascular-to-intravascular protein ratios in zones receiving endotoxin-treated neutrophils were significantly increased compared with control zones (0.146 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.079 +/- 0.02, P less than 0.05). Because complement fragments increase injury to endothelium in vitro, exogenous C5 fragments were administered to other dogs before administration of neutrophils but failed to significantly increase the extravascular protein signal (0.154 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.124 +/- 0.04). In summary, endotoxin treatment of neutrophils leads to neutrophil sequestration and increased pulmonary extravascular protein accumulation. C5 fragments failed to further enhance the protein accumulation. These data are consistent with an effect of endotoxin on the neutrophil to initiate neutrophil-endothelial interaction and subsequent lung injury.\r"

All intensities were greater than those eliciting peak O2 uptake for the individual subjects. Blood samples were collected at rest, immediately after exercise, and at 5 and 15 min postexercise. Significant (P less than 0.05) increases were observed at 36% MLP for beta-EP and ACTH immediately after exercise and at 5 and 15 min postexercise. Plasma cortisol increased at 36% MLP at 15 min postexercise. Blood lactate significantly increased at all postexercise collection points for exercise intensities of 36, 55, and 73% MLP and at 5 min postexercise for 100% MLP. beta-EP concentrations at 36% MLP were significantly correlated (r = 0.75) with capillary density (mm-2), and cortisol concentrations at 36% MLP were significantly correlated (r = 0.89) with percentage of type II muscle fibers. No other significant relationships were observed. These data show that brief, high-intensity exercise up to maximal power production results in a nonlinear response pattern in peripheral blood hormone concentrations. Furthermore, blood lactate levels do not appear to be related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal hormone plasma concentrations at high exercise intensities.\r"

Oxidation of exogenous glucose and glucose polymer (72 +/- 15 and 65 +/- 18%, respectively, of the 98.9 +/- 4.7 g ingested) was similar and significantly greater than exogenous fructose oxidation (54 +/- 13%). A transient rise in plasma glucose concentration was observed with glucose ingestion only. However, plasma insulin levels were similar with glucose and glucose polymer ingestions and significantly higher than with water or fructose ingestion. Plasma free fatty acid and glycerol responses to exercise were blunted with carbohydrate ingestion. However, fat utilization was not significantly different with water (82 +/- 14 g), glucose (60 +/- 3 g), fructose (59 +/- 11 g), or glucose polymer ingestion (60 +/- 8 g). Endogenous carbohydrate utilization was significantly lower with glucose (184 +/- 22 g), glucose polymer (187 +/- 31 g), and fructose (211 +/- 18 g) than with water (239 +/- 30 g) ingestion. Plasma volume slightly increased with water ingestion (7.4 +/- 4.5%), but the decrease was similar with glucose (-7.6 +/- 5.1%) and glucose polymer (-8.2 +/- 4.6%), suggesting that the rate of water delivery to plasma was similar with the two carbohydrates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89139293\r", 
  ".W": "Removal of epithelium from mammalian tracheae has been shown to enhance responsiveness to a variety of contractile and relaxant agents. One of the most dramatic shifts reported has been for guinea pig tracheal tissue denuded of epithelium and treated with substance P. We investigated whether this shift in responsiveness was because of 1) removal of an epithelium-associated enzyme, neutral endopeptidase, which degrades substance P and 2) loss of an epithelium-derived noncyclooxygenase relaxant factor. Using a muscle bath preparation we performed concentration-response curves with substance P and acetylcholine on indomethacin-treated tissues with and without intact epithelium and with and without pretreatment with the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, phosphoramidon. Epithelium removal potentiated the mean agonist concentration calculated to causes 30% of the maximal contractile response by 148-fold for substance P and by 7-fold for acetylcholine. Phosphoramidon potentiated the contractile response to substance P, but not to acetylcholine, by both the epithelium-intact and denuded tissues (P less than 0.05). However, the degree of enhancement by phosphoramidon was much greater in the intact tissues. With phosphoramidon treatment, therefore, the difference in responsiveness to substance P between the intact and denuded tissues was reduced from 148-fold to 18-fold. This effect of phosphoramidon suggests that the hyperresponsiveness to substance P of epithelium-denuded airway tissue is largely because of removal of neutral endopeptidase. Because all tissues were treated with indomethacin, the leftward shifts in substance P and in acetylcholine responsiveness induced by epithelium removal further suggest that an epithelium-derived noncyclooxygenase factor other than neutral endopeptidase also modulates the contractile response to substance P and to acetylcholine.\r"

We activated by hyperthermia four sympathetic pathways: alpha-adrenergic [norepinephrine (NE) release], beta-adrenergic [plasma renin activity (PRA)], cholinergic (sweating), and peptidergic (active vasodilation). In the first test, five normothermic men were exposed to hypoxemia for 10 min (control), then hypoxemia plus heat for 30 min, and then heat with normoxia for 8-10 min over a continuous 48- to 50-min period. Heating was controlled with a water-perfused suit. Time courses and magnitudes of heat-induced increments in body temperature, forearm blood flow, and sweat rate were normal during hypoxemia and unaffected by switching to normoxia. Hypoxemia exaggerated increases in plasma NE, epinephrine, PRA, and heart rate but had no additional effects on blood pressure. In a second 50-min test (2 men) with normoxic control (10 min), heating plus normoxia (20 min), and heating plus hypoxemia (20 min), effects of hypoxemia on all variables were as in the first test. Thus, acute moderate hypoxemia did not blunt active cutaneous vasodilation or sweating and exaggerated increases in catecholamines and heart rate, indicating maintained peripheral autonomic function.\r"

We investigated the effect of applying positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and, on a subsequent occasion, of injecting oleic acid intravenously to produce acute lung injury on the pulmonary clearance rate. Base-line clearance rates were monoexponential and varied with the molecular weights of the radiotracers. For each tracer the rate of clearance was increased a similar degree by either PEEP or oleic acid. However, with PEEP, clearance remained monoexponential, whereas after oleic acid, smaller molecular-weight radiotracers had multiexponential clearance curves. This suggests that after oleic acid the alveolar epithelium breaks down in a nonuniform fashion. We conclude that differentiation of the effect of PEEP from that of severe lung injury caused by oleic acid is not readily accomplished by either increasing the size of the tracer molecule or by varying the molecular charge.\r"

Pleural pressure was decreased by spontaneous inspiration, Mueller maneuver, and phrenic stimulation and increased by intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). To separate effects due to blood flow, we analyzed beating and nonbeating hearts. In beating hearts, there were no significant differences between changes in Pes and pericardial pressures. In arrested hearts, increasing LV pressure by 8 Torr increased pericardial pressures by only 3.6 Torr. With IPPV and PEEP, increases in Pes and pericardial pressures were equal in live hearts and in low-volume arrested hearts (LV pressure = 4 Torr). In high-volume arrested hearts (LV pressure = 12 Torr), the increase in pericardial pressure over the anterior LV surface was less than Pes, whereas that over the lateral and inferior LV surfaces was the same as Pes. At high LV volume, in arrested hearts pericardial pressures decreased less than Pes during negative pressure maneuvers. In another six dogs, external LV configuration and volume were measured. In beating hearts during spontaneous inspiration, Mueller maneuver, and phrenic stimulation (endotracheal tube open), septal-lateral dimension and LV volume decreased by approximately 3% (P less than 0.05). This was also true for PEEP. In arrested hearts, septal-lateral dimension and LV volume decreased only with PEEP. We conclude that 1) the relationship between Pes and pericardial pressures is complex and depends on LV volume, local pericardial compliance, and the means by which Pes is changed, 2) changes in measured pericardial pressures did not completely explain changes in LV configuration, and 3) during different respiratory maneuvers, different forces account for the same observed changes in LV volume and configuration.\r"

Eight had had spondylosis; five, a traumatic injury; and one, a benign intradural tumor. In eight of the fourteen patients, the severe kyphosis and myelopathy had developed after a laminectomy of three, four, or five cervical vertebrae. The laminectomy had been done for the treatment of spondylosis in five patients, of a traumatic lesion in two, and of a tumor in one. Considering all fourteen patients, an average of 2.25 vertebral bodies was removed from each, and the average extent of the subsequent fusion was 3.25 levels. Eight patients (six of whom had spondylosis; one, a traumatic lesion; and one, a tumor) were treated with a fibular graft that spanned an average of 4.10 levels, and six patients (four of whom had a traumatic lesion and two, spondylosis) were treated with an iliac graft that spanned an average of 2.70 levels. Of the five patients who had a traumatic lesion, four were treated with anterior decompression and arthrodesis, combined with posterior arthrodesis that was performed during the same period of anesthesia. In three patients, the anterior graft dislodged during the immediate postoperative period. Two of the three patients had posterior instability due to a prior laminectomy, and in the third the graft dislodged because of technical difficulties. Two of these grafts were revised to restore stability. At the latest follow-up, twelve of the fourteen fusions were solid. In the other two patients, who died six and ten months postoperatively, the fusion had been solid, as shown by radiographs, before the time of death. The average amount of correction of the kyphotic deformities was 32 degrees, a reduction from an average of 45 degrees to an average of 13 degrees. All but one patient had some recovery of neural function; nine had complete and four, partial recovery. The remaining patient had relief of pain, but he continued to be completely quadriplegic although he had some sensory sparing. Of the four patients who had been unable to walk preoperatively, three were able to walk postoperatively. No patient lost neural function after the anterior decompression and arthrodesis. We concluded that, in the presence of severe cervical kyphosis and myelopathy, adequate anterior decompression of the spinal cord, correction of the kyphosis, and anterior arthrodesis using a strut graft can yield excellent results without undue risk.\r"

Forty-two patients who had an isolated intertrochanteric or femoral neck fracture participated, and forty of these patients completed the study. The average age of the patients was 81.6 years. Venography was the standard with which all ultrasonic studies were compared. A total of 112 ultrasonic studies were performed. The incidence of major venous thrombosis, as detected by venography, was 12.5 per cent. All patients were clinically asymptomatic. The compression ultrasonic technique had an accuracy of 97 per cent, a sensitivity of 100 per cent, and a specificity of 97 per cent. Compression ultrasonography appears to be a very effective technique for diagnosing venous thrombosis in patients who have a fracture of the hip. It is safe, well accepted by both patients and staff, and simply and quickly performed, and it carries no inherent risks. It also can be readily repeated, making it ideal for monitoring high-risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "As muscle wasting and resistance to insulin-mediated glucose utilization are features of Cushing's syndrome (CS), we examined glucose and amino acid metabolism in six patients with CS and six normal subjects before and during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies (plasma insulin concentrations, approximately 0.36, approximately 0.65, and approximately 10.05 mmol/L). The two groups had similar body mass index values. In the postabsorptive state, leucine and alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC) rates of appearance (Ra), KIC oxidation, and nonoxidized leucine-carbon flux, an index of leucine entering protein (Leu----P), were comparable in CS patients [2.38 +/- 0.14 (+/- SE), 0.22 +/- 0.04, and 2.16 +/- 0.12 mumol/kg.min) and in normal subjects (2.73 +/- 0.25, 0.17 +/- 0.02, and 2.59 +/- 0.22 mumol/kg.min). During the euglycemic clamp studies the leucine and KIC Ra values, KIC oxidation, and Leu----P decreased to a similar extent in both groups. In contrast, insulin-mediated glucose utilization was impaired in the CS patients at each clamp step (P less than 0.05). In summary, postabsorptive whole body leucine metabolism is normal in patients with CS and is normally suppressed by hyperinsulinemia, indicating a dissociation in insulin sensitivity with respect to glucose and amino acid metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether physiological increments in circulating GH concentrations influence glucose-induced glucose uptake (GIGU), two-step sequential hyperglycemic clamp (plasma glucose, 6 and 14 mmol/L) studies were performed in six normal subjects with and without GH infusion (40 ng/kg.min). The latter resulted in serum GH levels of 15 +/- 1 (+/- SE) microgram/L. Infusion of somatostatin (250 micrograms/h during step 1 and 750 micrograms/h during step 2) together with a replacement dose of insulin (1.1 pmol/kg.min) resulted in serum insulin levels comparable to basal levels in both studies. The GIGU ([3-3H]glucose), assessed as the difference between steps 2 and 1 glucose utilization during the final 60 min of each step (150 min) was markedly impaired during GH infusion (with GH, 1.1 +/- 0.2 mg/kg.min; without GH, 3.1 +/- 0.3 mg/kg.min; P less than 0.001). Moreover, the percent increase in glucose uptake was considerably reduced during hypersomatotropinemia (with GH, 44 +/- 9%; without GH, 97 +/- 11%; P less than 0.01). In the GH infusion as well as control studies, endogenous glucose production (EGP) was similar at the two levels of glycemia, whereas GH infusion approximately doubled EGP [2.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.3 mg/kg.min and 2.0 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.4 mg/kg.min (step 1 and 2, respectively)]. We conclude that moderate hypersomatotropinemia for several hours is characterized by impaired GIGU as well as augmented EGP.\r"

  ".W": "Although GH deficiency (GHD) is the most frequent hormonal abnormality that occurs after cranial radiation, the natural course of this complication and its relationship to growth in children are not known. Therefore, we undertook a 2-yr prospective study of 16 children, aged 1.7-15 yr at the time of treatment, who received cranial [31-42 Gy (1 Gy = 100 rads)] and spinal radiation for medulloblastoma or ependymoma (group I). Their growth was compared to that of 11 children given similar doses of cranial radiation only (group II). The mean plasma GH response to arginine-insulin test (AITT) was 9.1 +/- 1.5 (+/- SE) micrograms/L in group I and 8.5 +/- 1.8 micrograms/L in group II (P = NS). After 2 yr, 16 of the 27 children had a peak plasma GH value below 8 micrograms/L after AITT, and 10 children had a peak response less than 5 micrograms/L. In addition, in group I, AITT and sleep-related GH secretion were compared; at the 2 yr follow-up only 3 of 13 children had discrepant results. At the 2 yr follow-up children treated by cranial and spinal radiation had a mean height of -1.46 +/- 0.40 SD below the normal mean. In contrast, the children given only cranial radiation had a mean height of -0.15 +/- 0.18 SD; P less than 0.02. Therefore, most of the growth retardation appeared to be due to lack of spinal growth. GHD is thus an early complication of cranial radiation in these children, and no significant growth retardation can be attributed to GHD during the first 2 yr. These data contribute to the organization of follow-up in irradiated children in order to decide when human GH treatment is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "We compared estimates of in vivo insulin action derived from insulin tolerance tests (ITT) and euglycemic and hyperglycemic glucose clamp studies in 17 normal subjects and 19 patients with various diseases characterized by insulin resistance. Fifteen subjects underwent an ITT and a euglycemic clamp study, 17 subjects underwent an ITT and a hyperglycemic clamp study, and 4 subjects underwent all 3 tests. The ITT consisted of a bolus iv injection of regular insulin (0.1 U/kg BW). The plasma glucose disappearance rate during the 3- to 15-min period following the insulin injection was taken as a measure of insulin action. In both euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp studies, which were carried out with standard techniques, the ratio between the amount of glucose infused to maintain glycemia at the desired level and the mean plasma insulin concentration from 60-120 min (M) (euglycemic clamp studies) or 20-120 min (I) (hyperglycemic clamp studies) was used as a measure of insulin action. A close correlation was found between plasma glucose disappearance rate and the M/I ratio during either the euglycemic (r = 0.811; P less than 0.001) or the hyperglycemic (r = 0.826; P less than 0.001) clamp studies. These results suggest that the 15-min ITT is suitable as a simple and rapid estimation of in vivo insulin action when glucose clamp studies are not feasible, as in large series of subjects or serial studies.\r"

A-II infusion increased (15-25%) both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the normal state and during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, whereas the increase during diuretic-stimulated renin-angiotensin system function was less. The plasma RS concentration was measured by both direct and indirect RIA. The mean basal plasma RS levels, measured with direct assay, were 1516 +/- 150 (SE) in the normal state, 1566 +/- 150 after diuretic administration, and 1650 +/- 133 nmol/L after enalapril administration. The corresponding mean basal plasma RS levels measured with the indirect assay were 1073 +/- 100, 1031 +/- 57, and 902 +/- 78 nmol/L, respectively. Plasma RS levels did not change during or after the A-II infusions, whereas PRA decreased significantly in all experimental conditions. The results suggest that A-II exerts no direct stimulatory effect on hepatic release of RS. Thus, A-II appears not to be important in the short term regulation of plasma RS levels.\r"

To provide insights into possible mechanisms and influence of obesity, 8 lean and 12 obese subjects [106 +/- 11% (SD) and 193 +/- 31% of reference table weight, respectively] eating previously isocaloric diets were exercised to exhaustion (7 +/- 3 min) on a cycle ergometer, then followed for 60 min of recovery. The obese subjects at rest had slightly increased plasma glucose and insulin and elevated blood glycerol concentrations. Both lean and obese subjects had little or no changes in plasma glucose or insulin during exercise, but the increases during the recovery period were greater and/or sustained longer in the obese. Such results raise the possibility of transient hepatic insulin resistance after exercise and are possibly relevant to restoration of depleted muscle glycogen. Both groups had a marked fall in plasma FFA during exercise; the reduction was sustained in the lean but not in the obese subjects. Blood glycerol increased during the recovery period to higher values in the obese than in the lean subjects. Plasma norepinephrine increased about 4-fold in both groups, returning promptly to preexercise values. In contrast, the exercise-induced increment in plasma epinephrine [values at exhaustion, 933 +/- 548 vs. 1970 +/- 787 pmol/L; P less than 0.005] was markedly attenuated in the obese subjects. Thus, the obese subjects had exercise-induced changes in glucose and inulin metabolism consistent with greater postexercise insulin resistance, despite an impaired plasma epinephrine response to intense exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The intraprostatic concentrations of testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) have been measured in only a few men. We measured, in prostatic tissue obtained at surgery from seven men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, the effects of 3-month treatment with a long-acting GnRH agonist on 1) the intraprostatic concentrations of T, DHT, and 5 alpha-androstan-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol (3 alpha-diol); 2) prostatic 5 alpha-reductase activity; and 3) the prostatic content of androgen receptors (AR). Plasma T, DHT, and 3 alpha-diol levels also were measured. Prostatic tissue samples obtained at surgery from a group of untreated men with benign prostatic hyperplasia also were studied. The mean DHT and 3 alpha-diol concentrations in the prostatic tissue of the treated men were about 10% of those in untreated men (n = 19; P less than 0.01 for DHT and P less than 0.05 for 3 alpha-diol), and the mean intraprostatic T concentration in the treated men was about 25% of that in the control group (0.10 greater than P greater than 0.05). The mean in vitro formation of DHT by the prostatic tissue of the treated men was about 50% lower (P less than 0.05) than that by prostatic tissue of the untreated men (n = 9). The mean cytosolic AR content in the prostatic tissue of the treated men was significantly higher (P less than 0.05), whereas the mean nuclear content of both salt-extractable and salt-resistant AR was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than that in the prostatic tissue of the untreated men (n = 8). The mean plasma T levels in treated men decreased from 4.77 +/- 1.79 (SD) ng/mL (16.5 +/- 6.2 nmol/L) to 0.27 +/- 0.42 ng/mL (0.9 +/- 1.5 nmol/L) after 1 month of therapy and remained in the castrate range thereafter. We conclude that pharmacological castration resulting from 3-month treatment with a long-acting GnRH agonist decreases the intraprostatic T concentration to about one fourth and those of DHT and 3 alpha-diol to about one tenth of the levels in untreated men. Thus, GnRH agonist treatment may not completely abolish intraprostatic androgen concentrations in metastatic prostatic cancer patients. The decrease in prostatic 5 alpha-reductase activity as well as the decrease in nuclear receptors are probably secondary to the decrease in plasma T concentrations.\r"

In serum, ir-EGF appeared and increased during spontaneous blood coagulation, reaching a plateau in 2 h. The mean plateau measured by time-resolved immunofluorometric assay was 778 pg/mL [130 pmol/L; range, 465-1352 pg/mL (78-225 pmol/L)] for men (n = 66), and 774 pg/mL (129 pmoL/L; range, 521-1114 pg/mL (87-186 pmol/L)] for women (n = 33). Serum samples (n = 9), when examined under nonreducing conditions by high performance liquid chromatography, contained three mol wt components. Their approximate proportions averaged 56 +/- 6% (+/- SD) for a 140K component, 22 +/- 9% for a 67K component, and 22 +/- 6% for a component coeluting with the 6K EGF standard. The molecular size distribution of ir-EGF released from isolated platelets varied with the treatment of the platelets. After stimulation with a Ca2+ ionophore, the proportions of the 140K, 67K, and 6K components were 61 +/- 11%, 20 +/- 8%, and 17 +/- 4% (n = 5), respectively, as in serum. In addition, we found a small amount, (approximately 1%) of a 17K component. When platelets (n = 6) were ruptured by sonication and repeated freeze-thawing, the 67K component formed 53 +/- 7% of the total; the proportions of the 140K, 17K, and 6K components were 14 +/- 7%, 2.1 +/- 0.7%, and 31 +/- 4%, respectively. Under reducing conditions the 17K and 6K components remained intact, but part of the 140K component and all of the 67K component were cleaved to a 35-37K form. After protease digestion of the higher mol wt components, the ir-EGF was exclusively of the 6K form. The 67K and 6K components bound to the EGF receptor, whereas the 140K component bound inconsistently. We conclude that treatment of platelets with Ca2+ ionophore produces ir-EGF components similar to those found in incubated serum but different from those obtained by freeze-thawing. The 67K mol wt component appears to be the main storage form of EGF in platelets; at least two independent mechanisms appear to exist for EGF release.\r"

Patients so treated developed the symptoms and hormonal profiles of adrenal insufficiency. To evaluate the mechanism of action of suramin on adrenalcortical function, adrenal mitochondrial and microsomal preparations from five subjects were assayed for steroidogenic enzyme activity in the presence and absence of suramin. Specifically, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, 21-hydroxylase, 11 beta-hydroxylase, and 17,20-desmolase activities were measured in the presence of 0-5000 mumol/L suramin concentrations. In all assays, enzyme activities decreased in a dose-dependent fashion as suramin concentrations increased. The drug doses (calculated) that caused 50% inhibition of enzyme activity were: 21-hydroxylase activity, 50 mumol/L; 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity, 25 mumol/L; 17,20-desmolase activity, 50 mumol/L; 11 beta-hydroxylase, 2 mumol/L, and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase, 1200 mumol/L. These results suggest that suramin has a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the key P-450-regulated enzymatic steps in adrenal glucocorticoid steroidogenesis, which may explain the development of adrenal insufficiency in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients treated with suramin.\r"

These studies were conducted on healthy nonobese young (n = 10; age, 20-30 yr) and old (n = 10; age, 62-80 yr) men. Each subject underwent two paired studies in random order. In all studies a [3H]glucose infusion was used to measure glucose uptake and production rates, and somatostatin (500 micrograms/h) was infused to suppress endogenous insulin release. In study A, plasma glucose was kept close to fasting levels (approximately 5.6 mmol/L) using an euglycemic clamp protocol for 4 h. Plasma insulin decreased to less than 20 pmol/L within 15 min and remained suppressed thereafter in all studies. Steady state (15-240 min) plasma glucagon levels were slightly greater in the elderly [young, 86 +/- 5 (+/- SE); old, 98 +/- 2 ng/L; P less than .05]. Basal glucose uptake was similar in both groups (young, 877 +/- 21; old, 901 +/- 24 mumol/min). Glucose uptake during the last hour of the study (180-240 min) was used to represent NIMGU, because insulin action was assumed to be absent by this time. NIMGU was less in the elderly (young, 744 +/- 18; old, 632 +/- 32 mumol/min; P less than 0.01). In study B, plasma glucose was kept at about 11 mmol/L for 4 h using a hyperglycemic clamp protocol. Plasma insulin decreased to less than 20 pmol/L within 15 min and remained suppressed thereafter in all studies. Steady state plasma glucagon levels were slightly but not significantly higher in the elderly (young, 88 +/- 6; old, 100 +/- 4 ng/L). Basal glucose uptake (young, 910 +/- 27; old, 883 +/- 25 mumol/min) and NIMGU (young, 933 +/- 36; old, 890 +/- 16 mumol/min; P = NS) were similar in both young and old subjects. We conclude that aging is associated with impairment in NIMGU only in the basal state, which may explain in part the increase in fasting glucose with age.\r"

The cDNA for a 25K IGF-BP was recently cloned and sequenced, and the primary structure of the BP deduced. This BP is found in amniotic fluid, decidual tissues, conditioned medium from HepG2 human hepatoma cells, and fetal plasma. An additional small IGF-BP has been identified in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We now demonstrate that the IGF-BP found in CSF is structurally and immunologically distinct from that found in HepG2 conditioned medium. While the latter BP has approximately equal affinities for IGF-I and -II, the CSF BP has a 10- to 20-fold greater affinity for IGF-II. In affinity cross-linking studies under reducing conditions, the CSF BP had an apparent mol wt (Mr) of 32,000, while the HepG2 BP migrated as a doublet, with apparent Mr values of 30,000 and 28,000. On Western ligand blots, CSF BPs migrate as five discrete bands, with the most prominent band at an apparent Mr of 34,000, while HepG2 medium yielded a single band at an apparent Mr of 30,000. A polyclonal antibody developed against the human amniotic fluid BP immunoprecipitated the HepG2 BP and reacted with both the HepG2 and amniotic fluid BPs on Western blots, but failed to react with the CSF BP. These data indicate that the CSF and amniotic fluid/HepG2 BP are structurally and immunologically distinct small IGF-BPs.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the postprandial pattern of carbohydrate metabolism differs after ingestion of an identical amount of glucose as either a drink or as a part of a mixed meal, normal subjects were studied on two occasions. On both occasions, hepatic and extrahepatic glucose metabolism were assessed using the dual isotope and forearm catheterization techniques as well as indirect calorimetry. Plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations and rate of systemic entry of ingested glucose all were lower (P less than 0.05) during the first 15 min after the mixed meal than after the glucose drink. The integrated C-peptide response was greater (P less than 0.05) after the mixed meal, whereas the integrated suppression of glucagon was greater (P less than 0.05) after the glucose drink. Despite these differences in circulating hormone concentrations, after the first 15 min, the rates of systemic entry of ingested glucose, endogenous glucose release, incorporation of carbon dioxide into glucose, and glucose and lipid oxidation as well as nonoxidative glucose storage were virtually the same after the mixed meal and the glucose drink. We conclude that the pattern of postprandial carbohydrate metabolism after ingestion of a glucose meal is remarkably similar to that after ingestion of a more traditional mixed meal. These data suggest that insights regarding the pattern of postprandial carbohydrate metabolism derived from previous studies employing only a glucose drink are likely to pertain to those observed when healthy individuals ingest a meal that contains protein and fat.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the stimulus-secretion response of human pituitary gonadotrophs in vivo, we applied a new multiple parameter deconvolution technique to analyze (1) exogenous GnRH-stimulated LH secretory responses in 10 men with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), and (2) endogenous and exogenous GnRH-stimulated LH secretory responses in 8 normal men. The GnRH-deficient men were given 4 bolus doses of synthetic GnRH (7.5, 25, 75, and 250 ng/kg) iv at 2-h intervals in randomized order after long term pulsatile GnRH administration. The normal men were studied by sampling blood at 10-min intervals for 12 h basally and after 2 consecutive 10-micrograms iv GnRH doses. The serum LH peaks in both groups were subjected to quantitative deconvolution to resolve underlying LH secretory and clearance rates simultaneously. Such analyses revealed that exogenous GnRH-induced LH secretory episodes in GnRH-deficient men with IHH could be modeled as algebraically Gaussian distributions of instantaneous LH secretory rates with a mean half-duration of 14 +/- 2 min. The simultaneously resolved half-life of endogenous LH disappearance was 71 +/- 5 min. The log dose-response relationship for GnRH dose vs. maximal LH secretory rate or vs. calculated mass of LH released per secretory burst was linear. In contrast, varying GnRH doses did not alter the duration of LH secretory bursts, the half-time of LH disappearance, or the latency of LH secretory bursts after iv GnRH injections (viz. 7.6 min). Deconvolution analysis of the spontaneous (endogenous GnRH-stimulated) LH peaks in normal men revealed a mean half-duration of secretory bursts of 9.9 +/- 1.5 min, and a mean half-time of endogenous LH disappearance of 76 +/- 5 min. These values were not significantly different from those in the GnRH-treated normal or GnRH-deficient men. In summary, deconvolution analysis of LH release in men with IHH revealed a significant linear relationship between iv doses of pulsed GnRH and computer-resolved LH secretory rate and/or the mass of LH released per secretory event. In contrast, varying doses of GnRH did not alter the lag time between the GnRH stimulus and the LH secretory burst, the duration of LH secretion, or the calculated half-life of the LH released. We conclude that GnRH exerts dose-dependent effects on specific attributes of the secretory response of human gonadotrophs in vivo.\r"

Such cytotoxic antibodies were found in 31% of the children and 24% of their mothers. In the 12 (of 37) newborn infants with hypothyroidism (group 1) who had positive tests, the median cell lysis was 20.1% compared to 4% in healthy newborns. In the 7 (of 29) mothers who had positive tests, the median lysis was 21.3%. In 24 older children with CH (group 2), cytotoxic activity was found in 6, and in them the median lysis was 19.7%; 4 of their mothers had increased lytic activity (median, 20.6%). In 96% of the mother-infant pairs concordance existed between the cytotoxic activity in mothers and their children. Increased thyroid cell lysis was found in 6 of 20 children with athyrosis (30%) and in 6 of 23 children with an ectopic gland (50%), but in only 1 of 14 children with a normal gland. Thyroglobulin antibodies were detected in 2 and antithyroid microsomal antibodies in 3 children-mother pairs. TSH receptor antibodies were present in 5 children and 3 of their mothers. The results indicate that intrauterine autoimmune thyroiditis could be involved in the pathogenesis of CH in some patients.\r"

TxB2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), the stable metabolites of TxA2 and prostacyclin, respectively, were measured in serum-free media from 48-h incubations of intact villi, villous core tissue denuded of its trophoblast layer, and trophoblast cells. In villi, the medium TxB2 concentrations increased rapidly to a peak level of 20 +/- 9 (+/- SE) (n = 11) pg/microgram protein at 48 h; 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was first detected in medium at 20 h, and it increased to 19.6 +/- 4.0 pg/micrograms protein (n = 11) by 48 h. Compared to villi, villous core tissue denuded of its surface trophoblast layer had a 7-fold greater TxB2 level (136 +/- 17 pg/micrograms protein; n = 11) by 48 h, but a comparable level of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (22.5 +/- 3.7 pg/micrograms protein). Trophoblast cultures produced predominantly TxB2 (109 +/- 18 pg/micrograms protein; n = 11) and had the lowest 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production among the three groups (11.4 +/- 2.6 pg/micrograms protein). At 48 h, the mean TxB2/6-keto-PGF1 alpha ratio was 1.0 in medium from intact villi, 6.2 in medium from villous core tissue, and 13.3 in medium from trophoblast cells. Indomethacin inhibited production of both eicosanoids in all cultures. Our studies indicate that intact placental villi produce equal amounts of Tx and prostacyclin, the trophoblast compartment produces predominantly Tx, and the villous core compartment produces an increased amount of Tx when denuded of its trophoblast layer. These data also suggest that the trophoblast produces an inhibitor or provides a catabolic function that limits villous core Tx production.\r"

  ".W": "In normal humans, arginine vasopressin and oxytocin are released acutely from the posterior pituitary gland in response to hypoglycemia, and their release may assist counterregulation. The responses of these hormones to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were measured in 16 insulin-dependent diabetic patients with no autonomic neuropathy (8 patients who had been diabetic less than 5 yr and 8 patients who had been diabetic greater than 15 yr) and in 6 normal subjects. The time of the onset of hypoglycemia and the mean blood glucose nadirs were similar in all groups, but the blood glucose recovery was delayed in the diabetic patients. In the normal subjects plasma arginine vasopressin rose from a mean basal value of 0.4 +/- 0.2 (+/- SE) pmol/L to a maximum of 1.3 +/- 0.6 pmol/L, and plasma oxytocin rose from 0.7 +/- 0.1 pmol/L to a maximum of 1.2 +/- 0.2 pmol/L 30 min after the onset of hypoglycemia. The plasma arginine vasopressin and oxytocin concentrations after hypoglycemia were significantly higher in both of the diabetic groups compared with those in the normal group. Arginine vasopressin and oxytocin rose in all control subjects after hypoglycemia. The individual hormonal profiles in the diabetic patients were variable, with an exaggerated rise of oxytocin in some diabetic patients and no rise in others. The arginine vasopressin responses were exaggerated in all of the diabetic patients. There was no correlation between the hormonal responses and the duration of diabetes. The exaggerated plasma arginine vasopressin and oxytocin responses to hypoglycemia in diabetic patients may indicate the failure of a normal inhibitory mechanism which modulates hormonal secretion or a compensatory response to impaired glucose recovery.\r"

The skin possesses protective mechanisms to limit colonization, and the survival of organisms on the surface lies in part in the ability of the organisms to resist these mechanisms. Microbial colonization on the skin adds to the skin's defense against potentially pathogenic organisms. Although microbes normally live in synergy with their hosts, occasionally colonization can result in clinical infection. Common infections consist of superficial infections of the stratum corneum or appendageal structures that can respond dramatically to therapy but commonly relapse. In rare circumstances, these infections can be quite severe, particularly in immunocompromised patients or in hospitalized patients with indwelling foreign devices. These infections are often resistant to conventional antibiotics and can result in infection with other opportunistic pathogens.\r"

  ".W": "Complete responses lasting from 4 to 14 years were documented in 65 of 331 (20%) patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma treated with topical mechlorethamine (HN2) between 1968 and 1982. Such long-lasting remissions occurred most often, but not invariably, in patients with patch or plaque phase mycosis fungoides without palpable lymphadenopathy (stage Ia or Ib). The likelihood of a continuous remission was enhanced by initiation of treatment before an unequivocal pathologic diagnosis. Despite the long-lasting responses in these patients, however, relapses have been documented in 11 (17%) of these patients, and all relapses occurred within 8 years of discontinuing maintenance topical chemotherapy. Thus, in our experience, a continuous remission lasting 8 or more years provides evidence that cutaneous T cell lymphoma can be eradicated by aggressive topical chemotherapy. This circumstance was observed in 35 patients, representing a cure rate of at least 11% overall. In addition, when compared with the general population of the United States, patients who received topical HN2 were at an 8.6-fold and a 1.8-fold increased risk for the development of squamous cell carcinoma and enhanced for Hodgkin's disease and colon cancer but not for systemic cancers known to be induced by systemic administration of alkylating drugs. These results compare favorably with experiences with topical HN2 chemotherapy at other centers but raise questions about the risks associated with long-term administration for maintenance of remissions.\r"

Also, in 36 patients evaluated retrospectively, the intensity of the direct immunofluorescence reaction correlated roughly with extent of disease, rather than with specific anatomic region. Localized disease predictably required less vigorous treatment to achieve control, but the intensity of the immunofluorescence reaction was not similarly predictive. Direct immunofluorescence is a less useful diagnostic test in localized bullous pemphigoid than in generalized bullous pemphigoid.\r"

Histopathologic examination of the red lunula in one of the four cases did not show signs of neovascularization.

After discharge, patients received decreasingly less potent corticosteroid creams as maintenance therapy for between 5 weeks and 13 months. As of this report, 7 of the 10 patients remain in remission (range 1 to 10 months). In one patient the disease was exacerbated, and therapy with corticosteroids could not be discontinued. No local or systemic side effects were observed during the study, and plasma cortisol levels were within the normal range when measured during the early tapering-off period while patients were receiving less potent topical corticosteroids. We conclude that clobetasol propionate cream produced rapid healing of bullous lesions without adverse effects and that this treatment followed by maintenance therapy with less potent topical corticosteroids was highly effective in patients with bullous pemphigoid.\r"

  ".W": "Forty years ago therapy for congestive heart failure was limited largely to the mercurial diuretics and a variety of cardiac glycoside preparations; these were often ineffective, and the common practice of \"pushing\" digitalis caused serious, sometimes lethal side effects. Today, a more complete understanding of the regulation of cardiac work and pathophysiology of heart failure is having a profound impact on therapeutic strategy for this common condition. Despite more powerful means to augment myocardial contractility and much more effective diuretics, therapy that relies only on inotropic stimulation and diuresis is no longer optimal for the majority of patients with heart failure. Thus, strategies for the therapy of heart failure must take into account new understanding of mechanisms that initiate, perpetuate and exacerbate the hemodynamic and myocardial abnormalities in these patients. Recognition of the detrimental effects of excessive afterload and the importance of relaxation (lusitropic) as well as contraction (inotropic) abnormalities has led to widespread acceptance of vasodilator therapy, which has dramatically improved our ability to alleviate the symptoms of heart failure. Changes that result from altered gene expression in the hypertrophied myocardium of patients with congestive heart failure can give rise to a cardiomyopathy of overload that, although initially compensatory, may hasten death. These and other advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology, biochemistry and molecular biology of heart failure provide a basis for new therapeutic strategies that can slow the progressive myocardial damage that causes many of these patients to die, while at the same time improving well-being in patients with congestive heart failure.\r"

This information is drawn from in vitro models of such cardiovascular stenoses and explores the limits of this simplification as they affect accuracy in special situations. Within the physiologic range, discrete small and irregular stenoses present no problems for the measurement of pressure drops using the simplified Bernoulli equation. Multiple side by side orifices of different dimension also give reasonable data using this approach. Tunnel-like stenoses of very small diameter and finite length produce underestimation of the true pressure drop through the stenosis when the simplified Bernouli equation is used. This underestimation is primarily due to neglect of the energy consumed by viscous friction in this situation. These considerations are especially pertinent to the problem of measuring pressure gradients across coronary vessels to assess their clinical significance as well as the adequacy of angioplasty and other intravascular interventional techniques. Because this area needs further exploration, some discussion of in vitro models as such as included.\r"

Ten normal and 10 age-matched asymptomatic subjects with asthma inhaled, with a standardized single breath maneuver, a dry aerosol (mass median aerodynamic diameter, 1.5 micron; geometric SD, 2.1) generated from solutions of methacholine at concentrations ranging from 0.078 mg/ml to 80 mg/ml in buffered saline, mixed with a fixed concentration of the fluorescent tracer quinine. The mass of methacholine deposited was calculated from the fluorescence of the inspired and expired aerosol trapped on an absolute filter before inspiration and during expiration. Specific airway conductance (SGaw) was measured before and after the inhalation of increasing concentration of methacholine, and the provocative deposited mass corresponding to a 35% decrease in SGaw was calculated. Baseline aerosol deposition (quinine-labeled buffered saline) ranged from 63% to 94% and was similar in normal subjects (mean 85%) and asymptomatic subjects with asthma (mean 84%). There was a correlation between the decrease in SGaw and methacholine mass deposited at first dose in the normal subjects (p less than 0.001) but not in asymptomatic subjects with asthma. Mean provocative methacholine mass corresponding to a 35% decrease in SGaw was 86 micrograms (range 2 to 157 micrograms) in asymptomatic subjects with asthma and 1361 micrograms (range 157 to 3434 micrograms) in normal subjects (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess whether the changes in airway methacholine (Meth) responsiveness induced by an initial hypertonic challenge determine the response to a subsequent hypertonic provocation, 11 subjects with asthma had bronchial challenges with 3.6% hypertonic saline (HS) and Meth in a dose-dependent manner and in random order. Challenges consisted of (1) an HS challenge (HS1) followed 1 hour later by a second HS challenge (HS2), (2) a Meth challenge alone (Meth1), and (3) an HS challenge followed 1 hour later by a Meth challenge (Meth2). The dose of HS that produced a 35% fall in SGaw (PD35) in HS1 was 69 L (geometric mean), and the PD35 in HS2 was 107 L (p = 0.02). Refractory index (PD35 HS2/PD35 HS1) ranged from 0.7 to 5.0. After HS challenge, airway responsiveness to Meth increased, and the Meth PD35 fell from 0.26 mumol to 0.11 mumol (geometric mean, p = 0.004). There was an inverse linear correlation between the refractory index and increases in Meth sensitivity (PD35 Meth1/PD35 Meth2) (r = -0.66; p = 0.027). After an initial HS challenge, the ratio of PD35 HS to PD35 Meth increased in all subjects, indicating that all subjects had become less responsive to HS compared to Meth, irrespective of their refractory index. We suggest that an initial HS challenge induces protective mechanisms toward a subsequent HS challenge in all individuals. The degree of increase in Meth responsiveness elicited by the initial provocation is a major factor in determining the airway response to a subsequent HS challenge.\r"

  ".W": "Many agents are capable of mast cell activation (MCA). In the lung, exposure to allergens induces IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation. By this process, chemical mediators are released and attract inflammatory cells that infiltrate the airway wall. This immune response is a potent stimulus for the pathologic changes seen in asthma (e.g., bronchospasm, mucosal edema, airway hyperreactivity, and mucus secretion). One neglected component of the asthmatic response is vascular permeability--the hallmark of mast cell degranulation. Like muscle contraction, vascular permeability occurs rapidly in response to an antigen challenge and is prevented by classic antiasthmatic therapy. Studies with antidromic nerve stimulation have indicated a relationship between MCA and the histamine-induced release of the sensory neuropeptide substance P, which causes vasodilation. Mediators released during the immediate hypersensitivity reaction may attract neutrophils and other chemotactic factors involved in the late allergic response, which includes a recrudescence of MCA caused by the release of histamine-releasing factors. Understanding these pathophysiologic events in asthma will be useful in formulating therapy.\r"

Increased responsiveness after an allergen challenge can be reversed or prevented by appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment. To determine how the inflammatory response contributes to an increase in smooth muscle responsiveness in asthma, local hematopoietic processes were examined. In support of the mast cell hypothesis, scrapings from nasal turbinate mucosa have shown greater numbers of mast cells in patients with allergic rhinitis compared with normal subjects. Similarly, the number of metachromatic cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid correlates directly with methacholine-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Since nasal polyps appear to result from inflammation of nasal mucosa, these tissues were also examined for the possible presence of progenitor cells that favor selective growth of basophil/mast cells. Since growth factors such as interleukins and cytokines stimulate cell activation, they may also contribute to ongoing inflammatory processes. Therefore substances that modify the production or actions of locally generated growth factors might be developed for the treatment of chronic inflammation of the nasal and bronchial airways.\r"

Although bronchodilators have some beneficial effect on the late asthmatic response, their value is limited when this is more severe, and they have no effect on the associated prolonged increase in responsiveness or the cellular phase of airway inflammation. In contrast, corticosteroids effectively inhibit both the inflammatory asthmatic response and heightened airway responsiveness. Serial measurements of airway responsiveness relative to exposure to allergens or chemical sensitizers and treatment indicate that airway inflammation cannot only be the primary cause of asthma but can also be responsible for its persistence and for exacerbations. Therefore anti-inflammatory drugs should be considered first-line treatment to minimize both airway obstruction and hyperresponsiveness and the need for bronchodilators.\r"

Because they need more aggressive treatment, this group is disproportionately represented in tertiary care referral centers. Therapeutic effects are dose dependent, and the daily dose of steroid required to normalize pulmonary function far exceeds that for symptom relief. Studies show that, if titrated to minimum dose levels of each the combination of inhaled and oral steroids provides a better balance between antiasthmatic and systemic glucocorticoid activity compared with oral steroid alone. Also, rapidly metabolized inhaled steroids such as budesonide may be associated with a lower risk for the osteoporotic complications seen with long-term oral steroid use. However, high dose of inhaled steroids may lead to adrenocortical suppression and hence estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women. Morning dosing may mitigate this effect. Oropharyngeal thrush may be prevented by lowering the dose frequency or using a spacer. During prolonged inhaled steroid therapy, patient compliance has proved an important determinant of outcome.\r"

Endogenously released spasmogenic mediators interacting with smooth muscle have a greater effect on hyperresponsive than on normal airways. Histamine, a bronchoactive and vasoactive mediator, is released in patients with naturally occurring or allergen-induced asthma. It is clear that mast cells are activated as part of the asthmatic response, and they have now been implicated as effector cells of mediator secretion based on the results of provocative tests. The advent of more potent histamine antagonists selective for H1 receptors has led to a reappraisal of antihistamine therapy in asthma. Drugs such as terfenadine and azelastine inhibit early bronchoconstriction and to some extent the late-phase asthmatic response as well. The efficacy of other new antihistamines (e.g., ketotifen and cetirizine) may extend beyond H1-receptor blockade to inhibit some of the chronic (and perhaps more important) cellular events in asthma.\r"

Total allergen load and \"priming\" are significant factors in nasal and bronchial reactivity. In IgE-mediated allergic reactions, an immediate early response is followed by a delayed response, with symptoms persisting after exposure to allergen. With immunotherapy, IgG titers rise, and the clinical response reflects a balance between the protective IgG response and the IgE-mediated allergic response. In the model studied, mast cell activation and mediator release correlated with the onset of early-phase allergic symptoms. By reducing the magnitude of mediator release and the severity of symptoms, immunotherapy may be used along with environmental controls and pharmacologic therapy to \"turn off\" the allergic reaction.\r"

Although glucose tolerance declined with age to a certain degree in all three groups, the age-related change varied as a function of both level of habitual physical activity and gender. Specifically, the decline in glucose tolerance was greatest in the male office workers and least in the females. The plasma insulin responses did not increase with age in any of the groups. These results suggest that glucose tolerance decreases with age because there is a decline in insulin action, which is not compensated for by an increase in insulin secretion. Insulin sensitivity appears to be enhanced in females as compared with males. Sensitivity is also enhanced in males habitually engaged in physical labor; thereby accounting for the age-related decline being greatest in the male office workers. Finally, the results showed that although the loss of glucose tolerance with age varied from group to group, the quantitative nature of the change was modest in all three groups. These data further emphasize that very little change in glucose tolerance is associated with aging in generally healthy, nonobese individuals.\r"

Here we describe the primary structure and regulation of two such cloned genes, pAT 464 and pAT 744, which may encode new lymphokines/cytokines. Similar to IL-2, both genes require the synergy of agents such as PHA and PMA for optimal expression, and, in addition, the induction of both is sensitive to the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. The two genes can be expressed in T cells, B cells, and the promyelocytic cell line HL60, but they are not expressed in human fibroblasts, suggesting that their expression is restricted to hematopoietic lineages. The predicted peptides encoded by these two clones feature hydrophobic N-terminal leaders characteristic of secreted proteins. The predicted size of both proteins is about 8 kDa upon cleavage of the putative leader peptide. pAT 464 and pAT 744 are very similar to each other and also share some critical amino acid similarity with a newly emerging family of secreted factors including connective tissue activating factor III, platelet factor 4, an IFN-gamma-induced factor, macrophage inflammatory protein, and a factor chemotactic to neutrophils (3-10C, monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor, neutrophil-activating factor). Some of these factors have been shown to display functions associated with an inflammatory response and/or have mitogenic activities. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that pAT 464 and pAT 744 encode novel lymphokines/cytokines which may play roles during an immune response similar to those enacted by these structurally related factors.\r"

The inhibition of inner membrane function is critical for effective cell killing as damage to the outer membrane alone is insufficient to kill a cell in the absence of serum lysozyme. Studies on the measurement of oxygen consumption for cells under complement attack showed that C-sensitive cells were inhibited by assembly of the MAC, and that this represents damage to some component of the respiring inner membrane. Mechanisms of cellular resistance to C attack could include 1) inhibition of the assembly of the MAC, 2) inhibition of effective activation of the assembled MAC, or 3) reversal of the inhibitory effects of the MAC. Demonstration of a transient C-mediated inhibition of inner membrane function in C-resistant cells implies that the latter case should be considered as one possible component of cellular resistance to C attack.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to examine the effects of i.p.-injected alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) on murine neutrophil migration into subcutaneously implanted sponges in response to IL-1-alpha, TNF-alpha, and C5a. The results show that as little as 0.1 ml of 5 x 10(-7) M MSH injected i.p. significantly blocked the accumulation of neutrophils in sponges in response to IL-1. This action of MSH was dose dependent, reversible, and was maximally effective if MSH was given at the same time as the injection of IL-1. This effect of MSH was not restricted to IL-1-induced neutrophil emigration, because MSH also antagonized the accumulation of neutrophils in response to both TNF and C5a. The proopiomelanocortin-derived peptide ACTH which contains the MSH sequence also significantly reduced neutrophil accumulation in response to IL-1, although less effectively than MSH. Similar studies with beta-endorphin showed that it had no effect on neutrophil accumulation in this system. The direct injection of MSH, beta-endorphin and ACTH into sponges or i.p. did not stimulate a neutrophil emigration and eliminated the possibility that MSH or ACTH suppressed the neutrophil influx in response to IL-1, TNF, or C5a by competing for circulating neutrophils. The action of MSH on IL-1, TNF, and C5a-induced neutrophil emigration suggests that this peptide may be an important regulator of the inflammatory response.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the activation of phosphoinositide turnover and of the increase in cytosolic free calcium, [Ca2+]i, in the phagocytosis and associated activation of the respiratory burst was investigated. We report the results obtained on the phagocytosis of yeast cells mediated by Con A in normal and in Ca2+-depleted human neutrophils. In normal neutrophils the phagocytosis was associated with a respiratory burst, a stimulation in the formation of [3H] inositol phosphates and [32P]phosphatidic acid, the release of [3H]arachidonic acid, and a rise in [Ca2+]i. Ca2+-depleted neutrophils are able to perform the phagocytosis of yeast cells mediated by Con A and to activate the respiratory burst without stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphates and [32P]phosphatidic acid formation, [3H]arachidonic acid release, and rise in [Ca2+]i. In both normal and Ca2+-depleted neutrophils the phagocytosis and the associated respiratory burst, 1) were inhibited by cytochalasin B; 2) were insensitive to H-7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C; and 3) did not involve GTP-binding protein sensitive to pertussis toxin. These findings indicate that the activation of phosphoinositide turnover, the liberation of arachidonic acid, the rise in [Ca2+]i, and the activity of protein kinase C are not necessarily required for ingestion of Con A-opsonized particles and for associated activation of the NADPH oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the respiratory burst. The molecular mechanisms of these phosphoinositide and Ca2+-independent responses are discussed.\r"

When the protein was added to an unrelated C-fixation reaction, lysis was abolished in a dose-dependent fashion. When freshly prepared T. cruzi extracts were run in a 10% acrylamide SDS gel into which normal rabbit IgG was incorporated before polymerization, proteolytic activity, as seen by a transparent band after Coomassie blue staining, migrated in the same m.w. range of the 52-kDa protein. These data provide further clues to the mechanisms through which this pathogen escapes the host's immune response, thus maintaining a long-standing infection.\r"

The L5 antibody-binding epitope has been mapped by two complementary methods; expression of gene fragments and synthesis of short peptides. This L5-binding region of the 18-kDa protein (amino acids 109 to 115) shows some homology to a region of the GroEL heat shock family of proteins. Characterization of this antibody-binding epitope may lead to a reagent of use in early diagnosis of infection.\r"

Monocytes pretreated with dimycocerosyl phthiocerol, mycoside A of Mycobacterium kansasii, or mycoside B of Mycobacterium microti, on the other hand, released O2- in quantities comparable to control monocytes in response to M. leprae stimulation. Monocyte O2- release in response to other stimuli of the oxidative metabolic burst, such as PMA, zymosan, Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin, or M. kansasii, was unaffected by lipid pretreatment. These findings demonstrate that PGL-I has a direct effect on monocyte O2- generation in response to M. leprae and suggest that PGL-I is a modulator of phagocytic cell function.\r"

  ".W": "The mAb anti-CD5 was linked to purified ricin A chain (RTA) or intact ricin (Rc) containing B chain to determine the role of ricin B chain in the intracellular trafficking of anti-CD5 immunotoxins (IT). IT were radiolabeled with iodine-125 and then studied for their subcellular compartmentalization in an acute lymphoblastic leukemia T cell line, CEM. Ricin A chain IT was not as toxic to CEM cells as Rc-IT in protein synthesis inhibition assays. This difference was not attributed to differential binding or modulation of the CD5 determinant from the cell surface as measured by FACS analysis. However, we found a relationship between the toxicity of anti-CD5-Rc and anti-CD5-RTA and their ability to traffic to CEM lysosomes. Kinetic analysis of the transfer of radioimmunotoxin to the lysosomes showed that anti-CD5-Rc was trafficked significantly more slowly than anti-CD5-RTA, perhaps due to an extended period of time in the Golgi compartment. The possibility of a Golgi interaction was tested by adding monensin, a carboxylic ionophore that interrupts trafficking through the Golgi, to cells treated with anti-CD5-RTA. The addition of monensin caused anti-CD5-RTA to traffic in a manner identical to anti-CD5-Rc. We conclude that 1) B chain slows trafficking of anti-CD5-Rc to the lysosomes; 2) the rate-limiting step in the toxicity difference between anti-CD5-Rc and anti-CD5-RTA is the rate of transfer to the lysosomes; and 3) trafficking through the Golgi may be important for anti-CD5-IT toxicity.\r"

BP sera reacted with four protein bands that were not detected by control sera: two major bands at 220-240 and 165 kD and two faint bands at 190 and 95 kD. Three of these bands were significantly associated with BP: 220-240 kd (51% of the BP patients; p less than 0.001), 165 kD (49%; p less than 0.001) and 190 kD (20%; p less than 0.05). These results are consistent with a molecular heterogeneity of BP antibodies, because each individual BP serum showed a distinctive pattern of reactivity. Thirty out of the 59 BP sera contained anti-basement membrane zone antibodies demonstrable by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). All these IIF positive BP sera reacted by immunoblotting with at least one protein band: 23 (77%) with the 220-240-kD band and 21 (70%) with the 165-kD band. Furthermore, 45% of the 29 IIF negative BP sera showed a reactivity with the 220-240-kD band and/or the 165-kD band. These results indicate that western immunoblotting might be a more sensitive method for the detection of circulating BP antibodies than IIF techniques, including IIF on salt split skin.\r"

  ".W": "The recent findings that the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A (CsA) improves psoriasis raises the possibility that cellular immune processes play a major role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. We therefore investigated the phenotype and function of cells within psoriatic epidermis that can play a role in cellular immunologic reactivity. Double fluorescence microscopic studies with monoclonal antibodies of epidermal cells in suspension (EC) and of histologic sections demonstrated that involved psoriatic skin contained a significantly increased number of non-Langerhans cell T6-DR+ EC (4.9 + 2.1%) relative to uninvolved (0.3 +/- 0.1%), p less than 0.01. This non-Langerhans cell population was comprised of DR+ monocytes, DR+ activated T lymphocytes, a few DR+RFD1+ antigen-presenting cells (APC), and DR+ keratinocytes. Langerhans cell (LC) levels in EC suspension were not different between involved and uninvolved psoriatic epidermis. Functional studies demonstrated that involved psoriatic epidermal cells had an increased capacity to induce T-cell activation and proliferation relative to uninvolved EC (p less than 0.04). This increased APC activity was due to the non-LC T6-DR+HLe1+ APC population and not to DR+ keratinocytes. These results demonstrate that involved psoriatic epidermal cells contain both an increased number and function of antigen-presenting cells. The pathogenetic mechanisms in psoriasis may be related to ongoing cellular immune responses in the skin, and the effect of CsA may be mediated through a suppressive effect on the enhanced antigen-presenting cell activity.\r"

We examined the ability of IgG in nine BP sera to bind to intracellular or extracellular antigen. On skin cryosections, indirect IF showed IgG bound to basement membrane zone (BMZ) and indirect ImmunoEM confirmed intracellular binding on the cytoplasmic plaque of hemidesmosomes. In contrast, when normal skin was exposed to BP serum in organ culture, direct IF showed fainter linear deposition of IgG along the BMZ, and direct ImmunoEM demonstrated extracellular IgG binding in the lamina lucida, predominantly beneath hemidesmosomes. Four of nine sera showed complement fixation on indirect IF samples (IgG bound to intracellular antigen) and three showed complement fixation on direct IF specimens (IgG bound to extracellular antigen). Three of the nine sera contained complement fixing antibodies detectable only in antibody populations specific for intracellular or extracellular antigen. Western immunoblots showed that five of nine sera recognized a 240-kD protein and four of nine recognized a 180-kD protein. There was no correlation between the presence (or absence) of either band and the detection of complement fixing antibodies specific for intracellular or extracellular antigen. BP autoantibodies bind both intracellular and extracellular antigen, and IgG binding exclusively to extracellular antigen that mimics the in vivo situation can be detected by using organ culture. Complement fixation may be restricted to antibodies specific for intracellular or extracellular antigen. These findings underscore the complexity of the autoantibody-antigen system in BP and have implications regarding the proposed pathogenicity of the autoantibodies.\r"

The 8G9D8 antibody recognizes the carbohydrate sequence N-acetylneuraminic acid alpha 2----3 galactose beta 1----4 glucose (or N-acetylglucosamine). Thus, in addition to ganglioside GM3, 8G9D8 may bind to glycoproteins or another glycolipid of the stratum corneum with a shared carbohydrate sequence.

This was accomplished by conducting experiments that made a direct correlation between two instruments: a laser Doppler velocimeter and an electromagnetic blood flow meter. Data demonstrate that the correlation between these two instruments is high and reproducible (r = 0.96) with a small (1.3%) coefficient of variation. Blood flow to skin in the unmanipulated state varies from 0.7 to 1.2 mls/min in an anesthetized rat. Application of the blood flow correlation to the determination of percutaneous absorption of caffeine across human skin and benzoic acid across rat skin demonstrates that assuming cutaneous blood flow is a particular value day to day in any skin type results in an apparent wide range of total compound absorbed across that skin on independent occasions. Utilizing actual blood flow measurements to calculate the amount of chemical absorbed reduces the range of variability in the total amount of chemical absorbed and provides a more accurate knowledge of events occurring during a particular time of the absorption process. Quantitation of cutaneous blood flow will be useful in physiologic and pharmacologic studies where actual cutaneous blood flow is likely to be important to the processes studied, e.g., delivery of drug to skin, metabolism within the skin, and disposition of drug to blood and skin following topical drug application.\r"

Twenty-nine common acquired nevi and 16 metastasizing primary melanomas were studied as controls. Two CMN of the series were giant CMN (greater than 20 cm), one of which later progressed to metastasizing melanoma. Of the remaining 34 CMN, four were histologically associated with a malignant melanoma. DNA flow cytometry was performed on adjacent cryostat sections of 37 biopsies from 28 CMN without melanoma. PAMAs were found expressed in CMN in the following frequencies: A-1-43: 36%; P358: 27%; PAL-M1: 20%; HLA-DR: 9%; Muc 18: 2%; A-10-33: 0%. No PAMAs were present in only 15 biopsies (34%). One single PAMA was found in 20 lesions (45%), and two or more PAMAs in nine lesions (21%). In all four CMN histologically associated with melanoma, and also in one biopsy from the giant CMN which later progressed to melanoma, at least two PAMAs were expressed. The latter biopsy was the only CMN in which the proliferation-associated antigen could be demonstrated. Only this biopsy and a single biopsy of the other giant CMN showed aneuploidy. We found expression of single PAMAs and co-expression of PAMAs in CMN in higher frequency than in common acquired melanocytic nevi. Co-expression of PAMAs was a feature of metastasizing primary melanomas. We conclude that co-expression of two or more PAMAs in a CMN might indicate its malignant potential, because this was found in all CMN proven to have progressed to malignant melanoma.\r"

Serum insulin was increased (P less than 0.001) but plasma glucagon was decreased (P less than 0.01) both during acute infection and the convalescence period. In the acute stage, 2-h values of blood glucose (P less than 0.01) and serum insulin concentrations (P less than 0.001) during OGTT were elevated. The index of insulin resistance (glucose x insulin) was increased by 33% during infection and by 28% during convalescence (P less than 0.001). The observed changes did not correlate with the severity of infection, were more pronounced in younger patients than in older ones and were not dependent on the infective agent. It is clinically important to recognize that the restoration of insulin sensitivity takes longer than the immediate recovery period from the infection.\r"

The procedure is performed by solvent extraction of BE from 0.1 or 0.2 mL of urine, followed by an aqueous wash of the solvent and evaporation. The dried residue was derivatized with 50 microL of pentafluoropropionic anhydride and 25 microL of pentafluoropropropanol at 90 degrees C for 15 min. The derivatizing reagents were evaporated to dryness, and the derivatized BE, and cocaine if present, were reconstituted and injected into the gas chromatograph. The column was a 15-m by 0.2-mm fused silica capillary column, coated with 0.25 micron of DB-1, terminating in a nitrogen phosphorus detector (NPD). Cocaine and the pentafluoro BE derivatives retention times were 3.2 and 2.6 min, respectively. Nalorphine was used as reference or internal standard with a retention time of 4.78 min. The complete procedure can be performed in approximately 1.5 h. The EMIT cutoff between positive and negative urine samples is 300 ng/mL of BE. The lower limit of sensitivity of this method is 25 ng of BE extracted from urine. Validation studies resulted in confirmation of 101 out of 121 EMIT cocaine positive urine samples that could not be confirmed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). This represents 84% confirmation efficiency.\r"

The overall 10-year survival was 64%. While most deaths due to tumor occurred within 3 years after diagnosis of bilateral disease, five patients died after 3 years (20%), three with synchronous and two with metachronous BWT. The survival rates for the 42 children with synchronous BWT (follow-up time, 6 1/2 to 14 years) and the 25 children with metachronous BWT (follow-up time, 5 to 13 years) were 69% and 56%, respectively. Due to an improvement in the synchronous group, overall survival improved over the years: 47%, 72%, and 70%, in SIOP 1, 2, and 5, respectively. Age at diagnosis and most advanced tumor stage affected prognosis. Children presenting a tumor manifestation before the age of 2 years had better prognosis than older children. This difference is significant in synchronous BWT. Prognosis for children with local stage 1 or 2 was better than for those with local stage 3. Median age at initial presentation in BWT was lower than in unilateral nephroblastoma and lower in metachronous BWT than in synchronous BWT. Young children presenting with unilateral nephroblastoma should have a careful follow-up of the contralateral kidney for at least the next 3 1/2 years, as most contralateral tumors will develop during this period.\r"

  ".W": "Childrens Cancer Study Group protocol 141 (CCG-141), a randomized trial, was designed in part to compare 3 v 5 years of maintenance therapy, to evaluate the role of late reinduction, and to identify factors that predict relapse after 3 years of continuous complete remission (CCR) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Of 880 patients entered on study, 827 (94%) achieved complete remission and 499 (56.7%) were in CCR after 3 years of maintenance therapy. Boys were required to have negative testicular biopsies before randomization. A total of 481 patients were eligible for the duration of therapy phase of the study. Of the 310 (64.4%) randomly assigned patients, 101 were entered on regimen A: discontinue therapy; 105 on regimen B: reinduction for 4 weeks, then discontinue therapy; and 104 on regimen C: continue maintenance therapy for 2 more years, then discontinue. After a median follow-up of over 72 months, no significant differences in disease-free survival (DFS) or survival were noted in the three regimens. At 6 years from randomization, 93.0%, 89.1%, and 89.1% of patients on regimens A, B, and C, respectively, remained in CCR. Isolated CNS or overt testicular relapses were not significantly different in any of the study regimens. Isolated testicular relapse after a negative biopsy occurred in only two of 137 randomized males (1.5%). DFS (P = .10) and survival (P = .83) were not significantly different for all boys and girls randomized to regimens A, B, or C. The relapse rate was higher in boys than in girls randomized to discontinue therapy (11% v 4%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .14). Except for the presence of occult testicular leukemia (TL) in males, no other factors were identified that predicted for adverse events after 3 years of CCR. We conclude that prolongation of maintenance therapy beyond 3 years does not improve survival or decrease the risk of relapse.\r"

In the BMT group, female sex, younger age, the absence of hepatitis during induction, a larger percentage of circulating blasts, and a shorter duration of symptoms were associated with longer survival, whereas only female sex and younger age favorably influenced disease-free survival (DFS). In the chemotherapy group, younger age, lower WBC at diagnosis, a single successful induction course, and the absence of circulating promyelocytes were associated with longer survival, whereas only a lower WBC and a lower percentage of peripheral neutrophils were associated with longer DFS. Estimated regression coefficients for treatment-by-prognostic-factor interactions were used to characterize subgroups of patients in which one treatment or the other produced better outcomes. BMT and chemotherapy produced similar durations of survival in a subset of patients characterized by many or all of the following: older age, male sex, achievement of complete remission (CR) after one induction, and absence of circulating blast cells at presentation. These data suggest that, using pretreatment variables, subgroups of patients can be identified for whom either BMT or continued chemotherapy is most likely to be beneficial.\r"

  ".W": "Four courses of PVP16B (cisplatin plus etoposide [VP-16] plus bleomycin) has been standard chemotherapy for disseminated germ cell tumors at Indiana University and the Southeastern Cancer Study Group (SECSG) since 1984. We began a random prospective phase III study in patients with favorable-prognosis (minimal and moderate extent) disseminated germ cell tumors comparing four courses of PVP16B over 12 weeks to the identical dose PVP16B administered in three courses over 9 weeks. The categories of minimal and moderate disease constitute approximately two thirds of all disseminated germ cell tumors that require chemotherapy. One hundred eighty-four patients entered this trial, and all patients have a minimal follow-up of 1 year. Overall, 106 of 107 (99%) minimal extent and 73 of 77 moderate patients (95%) achieved an initial disease-free status (NED), confirming the favorable prognostic categories. Eighty-six of 88 patients (98%) randomized to three courses and 93 of 96 randomized to four courses (97%) of PVP16B achieved disease-free status. There have been ten relapses (5%), with five on each arm. Currently, 81 of 88 (92%) and 88 of 96 (92%) patients randomized to three v four courses of PVP16B are continuously disease-free. This study confirms the high cure rate with PVP16B in favorable-prognosis germ cell tumors. The deletion of the fourth course of PVP16B significantly reduces the toxicity, cost, and inconvenience of this curative regimen. We conclude that three courses of PVP16B is the preferred regimen for favorable-prognosis germ cell tumors.\r"

Screening of quail embryos by dot-blot hybridization detected that MDV DNA existed in 100% of SUS quail tested. Resistant (RES) quail were a mixed population, with 16% of embryos resembling the SUS group. Functional MDV was not found by a number of methods including virus isolation, serological test, and exposure of sentinel chicks to SUS quail.

  ".W": "This paper reviews work from our laboratory on the molecular mechanisms involved in the nutritional and hormonal regulation of avian malic enzyme. The activity of hepatic malic enzyme, one of the set of \"lipogenic\" enzymes, is high in well-fed chickens and low in starved chickens. In chick embryo hepatocytes in culture, insulin and triiodothyronine (T3) are positive effectors and glucagon, acting via cyclic AMP, is a negative effector. Hormone concentrations in blood are consistent with insulin and T3 playing the major positive roles, and glucagon a major negative role, in regulating hepatic malic enzyme activity during the transitions between the fed and the starved states. New results indicate that insulin-like growth factor 1 also stimulates accumulation of malic enzyme. Our strategy has been to trace the intracellular signalling pathway from its distal end, altered enzyme activity, towards its proximal end, interaction of humoral factors with their appropriate cellular receptors. Nutrition- and hormone-induced changes in malic enzyme activity are due to altered concentrations of malic enzyme protein which, in turn, are due to altered rates of synthesis of malic enzyme. Synthesis of malic enzyme is controlled by regulating the level of malic enzyme mRNA which, in turn is regulated at initiation of transcription. The next step in this analysis will be to identify cis-acting sequence elements in the malic enzyme gene which bestow upon it a selective response to nutritional state and hormones. We are using transient expression systems and avian retroviral vectors to test the function of cis-acting elements involved in the regulation of transcription.\r"

The cDNA clones encode a cysteine-rich protein of 63 amino acids which shares extensive structural homology with the mammalian MTs. Southern blot analyses of total genomic DNA, and cloned chicken DNA indicated that the MT gene is a unique gene sequence. The chicken MT gene is structurally homologous with the mammalian MT genes; consisting of three exons separated by two intervening sequences. The placement of the intervening sequences in the chicken gene is nearly identical with that in the mammalian MT genes. Levels of hepatic MT mRNA were rapidly induced by metal ions (Cd2+, Zn2+, Cu2+), glucocorticoids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). MT mRNA was present in low levels in embryonic liver, but was inducible in ovo by injection of metal ions, glucocorticoids or LPS. Hepatic MT mRNA increased to high levels soon after hatching, before decreasing again to the basal levels found in adult liver. Levels of hepatic MT mRNA in hatched chicks were influenced by dietary metals. The results establish that the structure of the MT protein and gene has been highly conserved between birds and mammals, which suggests a functionally important role(s) for this protein.\r"

  ".W": "The HIV epidemic is similar to previous human epidemics, and our early responses to the HIV epidemic have likewise been similar. Furthermore, HIV is similar to other single-stranded RNA viruses in its evolution. Like other RNA viruses, HIV has a high mutation rate and thus evolves rapidly. This rapid evolution may make it difficult to develop a successful vaccine against HIV, and perhaps may also limit the usefulness of drugs because of the appearance of resistant mutants. However, most of the variation in HIV nucleotide sequences is neutral, not adaptive. Other viruses in the same retrovirus subfamily as HIV (lentiviruses) are also successful pathogens in animals and are difficult to control without the added problem of the social factors that exist for HIV. These social factors involved in HIV transmission make HIV hard to control by usual public health measures. The prevalence of syphilis and hepatitis B in the United States shows that neither a successful drug treatment nor an effective vaccine is sufficient to stop some infectious diseases when social factors are involved. For these reasons, I conclude that the HIV/AIDs epidemic is different, but not unique.\r"

  ".U": "89141400\r", 
  ".W": "The first step in the replicative cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is binding of the virions to the cellular CD4 receptor. This process may be considered as an important target for chemotherapeutic agents against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). A method has now been devised whereby virion binding to the cell membrane was visualized by an indirect immunofluorescence assay using human anti-HIV-1 serum, rabbit anti-human-IG-F(ab')2-fluorescein isothiocyanate, and flow cytometry. Heparin, dextran sulfate, and pentosan polysulfate suppressed HIV-1 binding to MT-4 cells at concentrations that protected the cells against HIV-1 cytopathogenicity. Dextran and dermatan sulfate, two compounds that are inactive against HIV-1, had no inhibitory effect on the binding of HIV-1 to the cells. The potent and selective HIV-1 inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT) did not affect virus binding to the cells, whereas suramin partially blocked HIV-1 binding to the cells at concentrations that fully protected MT-4 cells against destruction of HIV-1. Our immunofluorescence assay thus demonstrated that suramin not only acts as an inhibitor of reverse transcriptase but also interferes with virus-cell binding. Also, Evans blue, an anionic dye structurally related to suramin, partially inhibited HIV-1 attachment to the cells. The present method permits a quantitative determination of the inhibitory effect of anti-HIV-1 agents on virion-cell binding.\r"

All Betadine products completely inactivated the virus at povidone-iodine concentrations of greater than or equal to 0.5% (10- to 20-fold dilutions of stock) except for Betadine Lubricating Antiseptic Gel, which required 2.5% for efficacy (1:2 dilution). Chlorhexidine gluconate completely inactivated HIV at concentrations of greater than or equal to 0.2% (1:100 dilution of laboratory stock; 1:20 dilution of commercial stock). Betadine douche and medicated douche did not inactivate HIV at the concentrations recommended for clinical use (0.33% and 0.25%, respectively) but were effective at povidone-iodine concentrations of 0.5%. Inactivation appeared to be immediate since no difference in efficacy based on length of exposure to the microbicide was detected. Thus, both microbicides are highly effective at killing HIV in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in vitro has been described recently and was shown to occur by two mechanisms: either participation of the alternative pathway of complement or to involve an Fc receptor-mediated, complement-independent mechanism. Complement-mediated ADE results in an accelerated cytopathic effect in target cells that can abrogate the protective properties of neutralizing antibodies. This study characterizes the surface antigens of MT-2 cells using flow cytometric analysis and shows that these cells express high levels of both CD4 and complement receptor type 2 (CR2) while several CD4+ cell lines that do not demonstrate complement-mediated ADE lack high levels of complement receptors. Further, utilizing MT-2 cell cultures, it is demonstrated that complement-mediated ADE of HIV-1 infection is conferred by the sera from more than 80% of HIV-1 antibody-positive individuals (N = 85). Complement-mediated ADE of HIV-1 infection causes an acceleration of several parameters indicative of HIV-1 infection in vitro including increased HIV-1 antigen synthesis as detected by indirect immunofluorescence, RNA accumulation as measured by a solution hybridization protocol, reverse transcriptase release, and progeny virus production.\r"

Everted and noneverted sacs of rat distal colonic epithelium were prepared and incubated at 37 degrees C with porcine [125I]insulin and less than 1% of the [125I]insulin crossed the epithelial barrier under these in vitro conditions. The apical surface degraded [125I]insulin at a rate of 0.071 fmol/mg of dry wt./min, whereas the submucosal surface degraded insulin at a rate of 0.045 fmol/mg of dry wt./min. Over 60% of the available [125I]insulin was degraded by the apical surface of the distal colon during a 15-min incubation, whereas approximately 40% of the radioligand was degraded by the submucosal surface under identical conditions. Degradation of [125I]insulin was inhibited partially by the addition of excess unlabeled insulin and inhibited completely by the addition of bacitracin (1 mg/ml). These results indicate that the mammalian colonic epithelium is an effective barrier to transepithelial flux of insulin and identify insulin-degrading activity on both the apical and submucosal surfaces of the colonic epithelium. Although the colonic epithelium represents a significant physiological barrier to the uptake of insulin from the intestinal lumen, paradoxically, administration of large doses of unlabeled insulin into the distal colon or into the entire large intestine caused a dose-dependent increase in serum insulin levels during a 15-min experiment in vivo.\r"

Rats were treated with captopril (4 mg/ml of drinking water), propranolol (0.5 mg/ml of drinking water), hydralazine (80 mg/l of drinking water) or the combination of captopril and propranolol with and without T4 (15 micrograms/100 g b.w. i.p.).

Compared to treatment with T4 alone, captopril plus T4 decreased LV SP (P less than .05) and LV EDP (P less than .01); however, heart rate, LV dP/dt and LV weight/body weight were unchanged. Treatment with T4 plus propranolol decreased heart rate and LV EDP (P less than .05) compared to T4 alone; however, LV SP, LV dP/dt and LV weight/body weight were unchanged (P greater than .05).

Unlike D-Arg-[Hyp3-D-Phe7]-bradykinin (NPC567), which antagonizes bradykinin-induced contractions both in rat isolated uterus and guinea pig ileum, [D-Nal1-Thi5,8-D-Phe7]-bradykinin (NPC573) was active only in uterine smooth muscle. Binding studies revealed that, unlike several [D-Phe7]-substituted analogs, including NPC567, NPC573 competed with radiolabeled bradykinin neither at receptors in uterus nor ileum. Moreover, no [Arg1-D-Phe7]-substituted analog competed with bradykinin binding in guinea pig ileum, suggesting that these agents, which inhibit uterine but not ileal contractions to bradykinin, may not be bradykinin receptor antagonists. NPC573 inhibited [Arg8]-vasopressin-induced contraction of the uterus more potently than it did bradykinin, although NPC573 (and other [Arg1-D-Phe7]-substituted analogs tested) did not inhibit binding of a vasopressin antagonist either in uterus or liver membranes. We therefore suggest that [Arg1-D-Phe7]-substituted analogs of bradykinin inhibit contractions of uterine smooth muscle by a mechanism other than receptor antagonism. In addition, the tissue selectivity of these agents suggests that the mechanisms underlying bradykinin's contractile effect in uterus are different than in intestinal smooth muscle.\r"

DA was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to an electrochemical detector. L-Glu, NMDA, KA and QUIS, in the absence of Mg++, produced a dose-related, Ca++-dependent increase in DA release. The order of agonist efficacy was L-Glu greater than NMDA greater than KA = QUIS. D-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (0.5 mM), but not L-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, antagonized the action of L-Glu and NMDA, but did not modify the effect of KA or QUIS. Tetrodotoxin (0.1 microM) partially inhibited the stimulatory effect of KA and QUIS, but not that of L-Glu or NMDA. Mg++ (1.2 mM) abolished the excitatory effect of NMDA, significantly reduced the action of L-Glu, but did not influence the action of KA or QUIS. The inhibitory action of Mg++ on the L-Glu-induced DA release was reversed when L-Glu was coupled to high concentrations of K+. N-allylnormetazocine (SKF-10,047), a benzmorphan agent, produced a stereospecific inhibition of L-Glu-induced DA release. This inhibition was also produced by 1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine, a phencyclidine receptor ligand, but not by 1,3-di-O-tolylguanidine, a sigma receptor-selective ligand. The results of this study show that L-Glu increases DA release predominantly by activation of the NMDA receptor located presynaptically on dopaminergic afferents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PGI2 caused a relaxation from the basal level more effectively in the endothelium-intact preparations of the coronary artery than in those of the basilar artery. The PGI2-induced relaxation in the basilar artery was enhanced by removal of the endothelium, and by treatment with indomethacin (10(-6) M), aspirin (5 X 10(-5) M), both cyclooxygenase inhibitors, OKY-046 (3 X 10(-5) M) and RS-5186 (10(-6) M), both thromboxane (TX) A2 synthetase inhibitors and ONO-3708 (10(-8) M), a TXA2 antagonist. The enhancing effects of removal of the endothelium and treatment with indomethacin and aspirin on the PGI2-induced relaxation were greater than those of treatment with OKY-046, RS-5186 and ONO-3708. The PGI2-induced relaxation in the coronary artery was not affected by removal of the endothelium, treatment with indomethacin (10(-6) M) or methylene blue (10(-6) M). In the endothelium-removed preparations precontracted with a TXA2 agonist, PGI2-induced relaxation was less in the basilar artery than in the coronary artery. The present experiments suggest that endothelium-derived factors (TXA2 and other cyclooxygenase products) counteract the vasorelaxing effect of PGI2 in the canine basilar artery, but not in the coronary artery.\r"

Oncogenes and recessive cancer genes, first recognized to be of clinical importance during the study of Burkitt's lymphoma and retinoblastoma, are now thought to play a role in the development of most, if not all, tumors. Studies to identify more effective approaches to cancer prevention, detection, staging, and treatment are now seeking to build upon an understanding of those genetic alterations. It can be expected that pediatric oncology will once again play a pivotal role as these studies mature into clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "Published examples of unilateral and bilateral renal artery thrombosis attest to their usual subjection to nephrectomy at diagnosis or soon thereafter, eliminating the opportunity for spontaneous improvement which would enlighten the issue of how often late recovery may occur, and under what circumstances. Seven cases of renal artery thrombosis and five patients with renal artery embolization extracted from the literature have included documentation of patchy histologic viability within otherwise total infarction. Conversely, 47 reports of renal artery thrombosis culminating in nephrectomy or examined post mortem include no reference to any of these histologic features. Presumptions are speculative regarding whether these features were absent, overlooked, or unexamined. Their incidence cannot be estimated--only the possibility of recoverable renal function in an unknown number of involved patients. It may be presumed that the majority of kidneys exposed to sustained arterial interruption will undergo irreversible infarction, with an undefined small subgroup later developing renal hypertension. An unknown number, however, may fortuitously possess arterial collateralization competent to support sufficient numbers of viable nephrons to sustain adequate renal function. It is further speculated that shared pathophysiologic features establish the opportunity for misdiagnosis of renal cortical necrosis, which carries a documented potential for spontaneous recovery. Impulsive bilateral nephrectomy may therefore be unjustified, particularly in consideration of the minimal potential hazards of nonremoval. In the event of convalescent problems of renal origin, delayed nephrectomy remains an option. The requirement for interval hemodialysis is further influenced by the advantages accruing from retention of the native kidneys relative to calcium metabolism and blood product replacement. A final consideration relates to the advisability of secondary revascularization of spontaneously recovered kidneys for the purpose of further improving renal perfusion and renal function. It may be argued that stable renal function at levels compatible with a tolerable or uncompromised lifestyle is best undisturbed, with the intention of avoiding iatrogenic mishap. A more objective consideration relates to the observed late, progressive deleterious influences of hyperfiltration imposed upon the reduced population of surviving nephrons (3); would this process been exaggerated by improved perfusion? Dietary protein restriction has been advocated for patients at risk. Identification of late functional deterioration would initiate a reconsideration of therapeutic revascularization.\r"

In a similar study, we were able to show that LPS also inhibited 3H-palmitate incorporation by cultured lung cells. LPS-induced suppression of surfactant synthesis was reversed by hydrocortisone. Our results suggest that LPS may play a significant role in reducing surfactant synthesis by rat lung cells, and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of sepsis-related respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in burn injury.\r"

  ".W": "Although adequate volume resuscitation has decreased mortality from hemorrhagic shock, recovery in many patients is complicated by sepsis. To determine whether a subject debilitated by hemorrhagic shock would exhibit greater cardiocirculatory dysfunction when challenged with sepsis, ten dogs (Group I) were hemorrhaged to a mean arterial blood pressure of 30 mm Hg. After 2 hours of hypotension, shed blood and lactated Ringer's solution (50 ml/kg) were given, and the dogs were observed for 3 to 6 days. Ten dogs were sham hemorrhage and served as controls (Group II). On the experimental day, all cardiovascular and hemodynamic parameters were measured in both groups of animals before endotoxin challenge. There was no significant difference in cardiac output, stroke volume, stroke work, +dP/dt max, myocardial blood flow, myocardial oxygen metabolism, or acid-base balance in the two groups. Compared to sham-hemorrhaged dogs, resuscitated shock dogs had a significantly lower mean arterial blood pressure (127 +/- 7 vs. 110 +/- 6 mm Hg; p less than 0.05), and heart rate was significantly higher (86 +/- 6 vs. 109 +/- 7 beats/minute; p less than 0.05). Furthermore, maximal rate of left ventricular pressure fall (-dP/dT max) was significantly lower in the animals previously hemorrhaged, suggesting a persistent defect in left ventricular relaxation. Blood glucose and insulin levels were significantly elevated in the resuscitated shocked dogs, likely due to increased circulating catecholamine concentrations and enhanced glycogenolysis. Endotoxin shock caused significant hypotension, acidosis, and impaired regional perfusion in all dogs. In addition, cardiac output, stroke volume, dP/dT, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell and hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia occurred in all dogs after endotoxin injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Comparisons were made to a group of 25 healthy volunteers and 25 dialysis patients awaiting renal transplantation. As anticipated, there was no significant difference with respect to the absolute number or percentage of activated (T11+ and HLA-DR+) and cytotoxic (Leu-2+ and Leu-15-)T lymphocytes among the 3 groups. However, there was a significantly decreased absolute number (p equals 0.0001) and percentage (p equals 0.0001) of suppressor cells (Leu-2+ and Leu-15+) in the transplant patients compared to the healthy control group. No significant differences existed between the transplant and dialysis groups. There also was an increase in the percentage (p equals 0.000) but not in the absolute number of T helper lymphocytes (Leu-3+ and Leu-8-) in the transplant population compared to healthy controls. No significant difference existed between the transplant and dialysis groups. These findings suggest that a normal value of cytotoxic (Leu-2+ and Leu-15-) and activated (T11+ and HLA-DR+) T lymphocytes may be a good prognostic indicator of long-term survival of renal allografts. Also, the highly significant decrease in the number of Leu-2+ and Leu-15+ cells in long-term, well functioning allografts indicates that additional functional characterization of this subset may be necessary.\r"

Patients who received 0 to 2 third party transfusions were given no further transfusion, and received cyclosporine and prednisone immunosuppression after transplantation (cyclosporine group). Patients who received 3 or 4 third party transfusions were given additional transfusions until 5 had been received, and were managed with azathioprine and prednisone after transplantation (azathioprine group). Patients who already received 5 or more third party transfusions had no additional transfusions and were assigned to the azathioprine group. No patient had a positive crossmatch to the potential donor after initial evaluation and confirmation of a negative crossmatch. The number of rejection episodes per patient after transplantation was significantly higher in the azathioprine group for HLA-identical (p equals 0.001) and 1-haplotype (p equals 0.003) recipients. One-year patient survival rats for the HLA-identical cyclosporine and azathioprine groups were 100 and 94 per cent, respectively, with respective 1-year allograft survivals of 100 and 89 per cent in the 2 groups. In the 1-haplotype group 1-year patient survival rates were 95 and 94 per cent for the cyclosporine and azathioprine groups, respectively; allograft survival was 81 per cent for the cyclosporine group and 91 per cent for the azathioprine group. None of the observed differences in graft or patient survival between the 2 groups was statistically significant. Deliberate third party transfusions with conventional immunosuppression and cyclosporine immunosuppression are effective methods to treat recipients of living related donor renal transplants.\r"

In an effort to discern the proper role of these newer treatment options with respect to ureterolithotomy (flank approach or dorsal lumbotomy), we completed a multicentered study in which 142 upper ureteral stone patients in 7 different treatment categories were reviewed retrospectively and contacted for convalescence data. From these data we conclude that before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy an upper ureteral stone should be manipulated until it is either pushed back to the kidney or bypassed with a stent. This maneuver should result in successful extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in more than 90 per cent of the patients. For those few patients with an impacted upper ureteral calculus ureterorenoscopy is recommended. Given the presently available treatment modalities we conclude that less than 3 per cent of all upper ureteral calculi will require ureterolithotomy. In this last circumstance a dorsal lumbotomy incision appears to be less morbid and yet as effective as anterior ureterolithotomy.\r"

Bacteriological effectiveness was measured cumulatively based on responses during and at the end of treatment, and 7 days later at followup. Satisfactory bacteriological responses (eradication or superinfection at all evaluations throughout the study) were achieved in significantly more (p equals 0.03) patients treated with enoxacin (93 per cent) than in those treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (83 per cent). Both study medications were well tolerated.

In a pattern that parallels development of therapy of bladder stones, surgical treatment of upper urinary tract stones has progressed rapidly through development of safer open operations to percutaneous manipulative procedures to minimally invasive extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Each of these progressions contributed to a significant decrease in immediate morbidity, although therapeutic results remained similar. However, some deficiencies in our data about long-term problems with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy exist, including effects on renal function, effects on surrounding organs and development of new hypertension. A most important question that still must be answered is whether the apparent low morbidity associated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy obviates the necessity for medical prophylaxis of urinary stone disease.\r"

  ".W": "Idiopathic hypercalciuria, defined as the urinary excretion of more than 300 mg. calcium per day in men or more than 250 mg. calcium per day in women, or more than 4 mg. calcium per kg. per day, is observed in about 50 per cent of the patients with calcium oxalate/apatite nephrolithiasis and is one of the risk factors for stone formation. These patients do not exhibit hypercalcemia, elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations or urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate excretion nor clinical evidence of sarcoidosis, other granulomas or a malignancy. Hypophosphatemia may be present. Augmented rates of intestinal absorption of dietary calcium account for most of the increments in urinary calcium. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations are in the upper normal range or elevated among many patients and are normal but not suppressed in the others. Activation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D formation may be secondary to hypophosphatemia or other, as yet undefined, factors. Since, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D apparently can up-regulate its own receptor, small increments in its synthesis and blood levels could amplify the effect of the hormone to stimulate intestinal calcium absorption. Calcium balances are slightly but significantly negative and urinary hydroxyproline excretion may be increased so that a generalized disorder of calcium homeostasis also involving bone may be present. Additional studies are required to determine the genetic basis for the occurrence of idiopathic hypercalciuria in families, the cause of greater expression of idiopathic hypercalciuria in men and whether environmental factors (high dietary sodium chloride, protein and purified carbohydrate intakes) contribute to the expression of idiopathic hypercalciuria. Although thiazide diuretics, inorganic phosphate, magnesium hydroxide and potassium citrate have provided effective therapy, prospective studies are needed to determine optimum therapy and the optimum duration of treatment.\r"

  ".U": "89141942\r", 
  ".W": "Renal tubular acidosis is a term applied to several conditions in which metabolic acidosis is caused by specific defects in renal tubular hydrogen ion secretion. Three types of renal tubular acidosis generally are recognized based on the nature of the tubular defect. Nephrolithiasis occurs only in type I renal tubular acidosis, a condition marked by an abnormality in the generation and maintenance of a hydrogen ion gradient by the distal tubule. A forme fruste of type I renal tubular acidosis has been described in which the characteristic defect in distal hydrogen ion secretion occurs in the absence of metabolic acidosis (incomplete renal tubular acidosis). Type I renal tubular acidosis is a heterogeneous disorder that may be hereditary, idiopathic or secondary to a variety of conditions. Secondary type I renal tubular acidosis in sporadic cases is associated most commonly with autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, and it occurs more frequently in women than men. Nephrolithiasis, which may occur in any of the subsets of type I renal tubular acidosis, accounts for most of the morbidity in adults and adolescents. Major risk factors for nephrolithiasis include alkaline urine, hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia. In addition, we found hyperuricosuria in 21 per cent of the patients with type I renal tubular acidosis with nephrolithiasis. The most frequently occurring risk factor, hypocitraturia, is due to decreased filtered load and/or to increased tubular reabsorption of filtered citrate. While increased tubular reabsorption may be due to systemic acidosis, hypocitraturia occurs in incomplete renal tubular acidosis. Furthermore, alkali therapy (either bicarbonate or citrate salts) increases citrate excretion in complete and incomplete type I renal tubular acidosis. These data suggest that hypocitraturia in type I renal tubular acidosis may be due to a defect in proximal tubule function. Hypercalciuria appears to have 2 causes. It may be due to metabolic acidosis, usually in children with a hereditary defect in urine acidification. In other cases familial idiopathic hypercalciuria causes nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis resulting in distal tubular damage and type I renal tubular acidosis. In these latter cases hypercalciuria is present in complete and incomplete type I renal tubular acidosis. Potassium citrate appears to reduce calcium excretion in both types of hypercalciuric type I renal tubular acidosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

These beneficial effects are observed only when allopurinol is given to subjects with calcium oxalate calculi who have isolated hyperuricosuria. The specificity of this effect suggests that there is an important interaction between uric acid and calcium oxalate but the mechanism(s) remain to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "Nephrocalcin is a urinary glycopeptide that may be a physiological inhibitor of nephrolithiasis. Monomeric nephrocalcin purified from ethylenediaminetetracetic acid-treated urine is 14,000 daltons. Compositional analyses indicate that nephrocalcin is 10 per cent carbohydrate by weight and that 25 per cent of the amino acid residues are acidic (glutamic acid, aspartic acid and gamma-carboxyglutamic acid). Nephrocalcin binds reversibly to calcium oxalate crystals with a dissociation constant of about 0.5 microM. The high collapse pressure of nephrocalcin, 41.5 dynes per cm., measured for a monolayer at the air-water interface, suggests a highly organized structure in which hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions occupy separate regions on the surface of the inhibitor. Nephrocalcin contains the unusual amino acid, gamma-carboxyglutamic acid. Nephrocalcin isolated from urine of stone formers and from kidney stones does not contain gamma-carboxyglutamic acid and it has altered surface properties compared to normal nephrocalcin. The presence of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid modification and the ability to form stable films with high collapse pressures may be important factors enabling nephrocalcin to prevent stone formation in vivo. The blood of cold water fishes contains antifreeze glycopeptides and/or peptides to prevent it from freezing. The structure of one such antifreeze peptide and its interactions with the crystal lattice of hexagonal ice are discussed as a model for how nephrocalcin might interact with calcium oxalate crystals and arrest their growth in urine.\r"

Adjunctive therapy with pharmacological agents that inhibit urease with few side effects and effective urinary acidifiers favor chemolysis. Diet and chemotherapy offer the hope of slowing stone growth and/or recurrence in patients with chronic urease-producing bacteriuria.\r"

However, these new techniques should not affect the need for appropriate diagnostic evaluation and institution of medical treatment for the prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis. A diagnostic evaluation should identify underlying physiological and environmental defects responsible for stone formation, as well as identify specific medical disorders that cause recurrent stone formation. With this information one then can construct an appropriate treatment program that will prevent the occurrence of additional calculi. Comprehensive metabolic protocols have evolved from tedious inpatient procedures to more convenient outpatient tests that can be performed in approximately 2 weeks. In addition, the advent of automated urinalysis packages has allowed many physicians access to reliable, sophisticated technology. Further dissemination of these simplified metabolic protocols will enable more accurate diagnosis of recurrent stone disease and, hopefully, permit the institution of appropriate medical therapy by a wider group of treating physicians.\r"

For the first time it provides a completely noninvasive method for the treatment of renal and ureteral stones. The current range of its indications includes approximately 70 per cent of nonselected urinary stone patients. An additional 25 per cent of the patients with more complex stones in the upper urinary tract can receive treatment with the lithotriptor combined with endourological procedures. More recent additions to the range of clinical routine applications with the original lithotriptor have been its use on common bile duct stones combined with endosurgical or radiological manipulations. With a modified kidney lithotriptor gallstones have been treated successfully, which has led to the development of a multipurpose device for biliary and urinary stones.\r"

  ".U": "89141953\r", 
  ".W": "The relative roles of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrostolithotomy currently are being debated. Both treatment modalities are applicable to most upper urinary tract calculi. However, there are some important distinctions between the 2 techniques. Over-all, extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy is associated with significantly lower morbidity than percutaneous nephrostolithotomy but stone-free rates are lower for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy than for percutaneous nephrostolithotomy. This difference is slight for kidneys containing minimal stone burden but increases in direct proportion to increasing stone burden. The morbidity of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy also increases with increasing stone burden. When applied to the treatment of staghorn calculi the morbidity of both techniques is comparable but the stone-free rates are significantly better with percutaneous nephrostolithotomy. Treatment with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy produces changes in the kidney similar to that of renal trauma, consisting primarily of intraparenchymal and perirenal hemorrhage and edema. While the acute effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy are well tolerated by most patients, the long-term sequela of this form of therapy is not well established. Potential long-term adverse effects reported include loss of renal function, hypertension and an increased rate of new stone occurrence. The effect of shock waves on renal parenchyma in experimental animals is dose-dependent (number of shock waves). Magnetic resonance imaging of patients treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy demonstrates morphological abnormalities in or around the kidney in 63 to 85 per cent of the cases (average number of shock waves 1,200). Despite these observations the safe limits of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in humans have yet to be established. Further study regarding this issue and the potential long-term adverse effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is needed urgently.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have suggested that cerebral angiography may not be necessary before carotid endarterectomy is performed in selected patients. To determine if arteriography provides additional information that might influence the decision to operate or the conduct of the operation, a retrospective review was performed of 100 consecutive patients undergoing cerebral angiography and carotid duplex scanning. Eighty of the 100 patients subsequently underwent carotid endarterectomy for neurologic symptoms or asymptomatic stenosis greater than 80%. Among the 20 patients not operated on, three would have undergone unnecessary surgery for mistaken diagnoses had the arteriogram not been obtained. Two other patients in this group of 20 would have had carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis in the presence of an equally stenotic tandem lesion. Among the 80 patients operated on, an additional three had the operative procedure altered because arteriographic studies revealed pathologic findings outside the area of duplex scan examination. Thus the use of arteriography altered the management of eight (8%) patients in this group of 100.\r"

  ".U": "89141959\r", 
  ".W": "During a 4-year period, 136 patients undergoing 152 carotid endarterectomies consented to be randomized to primary or saphenous vein patch closure of the arteriotomy. At operation, before randomization, careful assessment of arterial dimensions and anatomy was made. Patients who had an internal carotid artery (ICA) diameter less than 5 mm, arteriotomy extending more than 3 cm beyond the origin of the ICA, or tortuous or kinked ICAs were not randomized; they received obligatory vein patch closure (necessary in 20% cases). All patients were followed up every 3 months for 1 year and every 6 months thereafter with duplex scanning, ocular pneumoplethysmography, and neurologic assessment. The incidence of atherosclerotic risk factors was equal in the groups and all except one of the patients were male. Perioperative morbidity was not significantly different among those having primary closure (n = 60), saphenous vein patch closure (n = 62), and obligatory vein patch closure (n = 30). Operative time among patients having primary closure (122 +/- 4 minutes) was significantly less (p less than 0.001) than among those having saphenous vein patch closure (150 +/- 3 minutes). Three perioperative strokes were evenly distributed among the groups (2% for all procedures); no deaths and no acute postoperative occlusions occurred. Recurrent disease occurred in 12.9% of patients having saphenous vein patch closure compared with its occurrence in 1.7% of those having primary closure (p less than 0.05). However, most recurrences were moderate stenoses (25% to 50% diameter reduction), all were smooth-surfaced, and none required a second operation. All except one of the recurrences among those patients with saphenous vein patch closure were in the bulb and the origin of the ICA; two had evidence of regression. This finding suggested that thrombus layering in the dilated part of the saphenous vein patch reconstruction was the cause. This study demonstrates that in men with carotid arteries of predetermined minimal dimensions undergoing carotid endarterectomy routine saphenous vein patch closure does not produce superior results, is associated with a higher incidence of early recurrence, and increases operative time. In selected patients with anatomic risk factors for recurrent disease or acute postoperative occlusion, saphenous vein patch closure is appropriate.\r"

Of 309 extremity examinations, duplex scanning had an overall sensitivity of 85.7% (12/14) and a specificity of 97.3% (287/295). The preoperative prevalence and postoperative incidence of major deep vein thrombosis were 2.5% and 14.1% of patients, respectively, despite intensive mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis. In addition, venography documented a preoperative prevalence and postoperative incidence of isolated calf deep vein thrombosis in 2.5% and 16.7% of patients, respectively. Whereas such disease extended proximally even in the absence of anticoagulation in only 18% of patients studied by serial duplex scans, calf deep vein thrombosis accounted for the only two instances of pulmonary embolism in this study. There were no deaths related to pulmonary embolism. This study suggests that duplex scanning is useful in screening for perioperative deep vein thrombosis in patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty, which carries a significant risk of venous thromboembolism despite routine prophylaxis.\r"

  ".U": "89141974\r", 
  ".W": "Protamine is used routinely at our institution during arterial surgery to reverse the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Adverse fatal reactions to protamine are generally believed to be rare. However, major anaphylactoid reactions occurred in 11 of the last 1150 patients receiving this drug at our institution. Nine of these reactions occurred in 325 insulin-dependent diabetic patients (incidence, 3%), whereas only two occurred in the 825 patients not receiving insulin (incidence, 0.2%) (p less than 0.001). Ten of these reactions occurred within 10 minutes of protamine administration (15 to 35 mg), whereas one reaction occurred immediately after administration of a 5 mg test dose of protamine. Systolic blood pressure fell below 60 mm Hg in all of the 11 patients, and three patients had to be resuscitated with closed-chest massage. Initial treatment with epinephrine and steroids was successful in seven cases. Four patients required further resuscitative measures, including closed-chest massage. However, one of the patients died as a result of ventricular fibrillation resistant to treatment. Ten of the 11 patients, including the patient who died, had significant preexisting cardiac disease; six of the surviving 10 patients (60%) had perioperative myocardial infarctions and three died. Thus the total mortality rate was 36% (4/11). These data support the implication that neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin produces an adverse reaction through immunologic presensitization of the patient. These data also show that, in the older vascular surgery population with a high incidence of significant cardiac disease, protamine reactions can be potentially lethal. Thus routine use of protamine should be avoided in diabetic patients receiving insulin.\r"

  ".W": "The cause and mechanism of post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension remains unknown. To determine the influence of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin system, we measured cranial and peripheral plasma levels of catecholamine and renin in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Baseline samples were drawn just before carotid clamping (sample I) and compared with study samples drawn immediately after clamp release (sample II), 2 to 6 hours after surgery (sample III), and then 18 to 24 hours after surgery (sample IV). The patients with post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension had an associated increase of cranial and peripheral norepinephrine levels in the postoperative hypertensive period whereas the patients without post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension did not. This association was most pronounced and statistically significant in cranial samples II (p = 0.032) and III (p = 0.005). Epinephrine and dopamine values did not correlate with post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension. Renin values were higher in cranial than in peripheral samples at time period 2 (p = 0.011), suggestive of a central nervous system Goldblatt phenomenon. However, the renin values did not correlate with post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension. We conclude that post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension is associated with elevated cranial norepinephrine levels, suggestive of a central nervous system sympathomimetic mechanism. Optimal prevention and treatment of this brief but frequently occurring hypertension should include a central-acting sympatholytic agent.\r"

  ".W": "The management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis remains controversial. From December 1983 to December 1987, 188 symptom-free patients were found to have severe (greater than 75%) stenosis by duplex imaging (performed as screening examination). Patients with non-hemispheric symptoms or contralateral symptomatic lesions (within 7 years) were excluded from the study. Follow-up data were available for 141 patients (range 3 to 36 months; mean 21 months). Sixty-two patients received nonoperative therapy. The remaining 79 patients underwent 100 carotid endarterectomies (CAE) (21 staged bilateral repairs and 58 unilateral repairs). There were no statistically significant differences in sex, age, or risk factors (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, or smoking) or in the incidence of bilateral disease. Significant differences were found in the incidence of ischemic attacks (0 vs 21%; p less than 0.001) and stroke (2.5% vs 18%; p less than 0.01) in the operative vs nonoperative group. None of the 11 strokes in the nonoperative group were preceded by neurologic events. The operative group had an overall stroke rate of 2.5% (2/79), a perioperative mortality rate of 1.3% (1/79), and a restenosis (greater than 50%) rate of 3.8% (3/79). Thus favorable results can be achieved with prophylactic CAE. These data support the use of prophylactic CAE in any patient with greater than 75% stenosis identified by duplex image, regardless of sex, age, risk factors, or bilateral disease.\r"

  ".W": "A recent review of 20 years' experience with neonatal intensive care for very-low-birth-weight infants provides reassurance that such care saves lives and that an increasing proportion survive free of moderate to severe handicap. However, data on the health status of these survivors largely reflect status in infancy. An increasing literature suggests that such early findings may be insufficient to characterize later outcomes, particularly those problems encountered as the child enters school. Since the specific health and developmental problems that might be encountered are still being defined, a broad conceptual framework is applied to organize a review of the existing literature. Some areas of concern about longer-term outcomes emerge, as well as important areas for which data are lacking. Further definition of longer-term outcomes is critical at the policy level to assess the utility of neonatal intensive care unit interventions and at the individual level for counseling families as to the health and educational needs of these children.\r"

Various data suggest that surprisingly few such organs would actually end up benefiting other children. Attempts to revise either the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act or the Uniform Determination of Death Act to allow organ removal from spontaneously breathing anencephalic infants face major ethical objections. Even if this posed no ethical problem in theory, the ultimate harm to society would not be offset by the good of the few surviving recipients of these organs. Furthermore, providing anencephalic infants with intensive care would tend to preserve the brain stem as effectively as the other organs, predictably rendering the occurrence of brain death unlikely. Thus, despite the great need for newborn organs, anencephalic infants are not as attractive a source as some had hoped.\r"

We have analyzed the outcome in 43 cases of fetal ventriculomegaly followed up without active treatment in utero. Our data suggest that the prognosis is poor for fetuses with ventriculomegaly and coexistent malformations, good for those with isolated, nonprogressive ventriculomegaly, and variable for those with progressive, isolated ventriculomegaly.\r"

Twenty-six of the 91 patients (29%) had received previous bolus 5FU. Fifty-eight of the 91 patients (64%) had two or more sites of disease, and 74 of 91 patients (81%) had liver metastases. Results were complete remission in 5 of 91 (6%), partial remission in 25 of 91 (27%), stable disease in 33 of 91 (36%), and progressive disease in 28 of 91 (31%), for an overall response rate of 30 of 91 (33%); median duration of response was 7 months. Twenty-six of 65 previously untreated patients (40%) experienced objective response. Median survival from initiation of treatment for all patients was 11 months. Forty-one percent of patients experienced no significant toxicity and were able to continue therapy without treatment interruption. Toxicities necessitating treatment interruption included stomatitis in 35 patients (39%), hand-foot syndrome in 33 patients (36%), and diarrhea in 10 patients (11%). No significant myelosuppression or serious catheter-related complications were encountered. We conclude that continuous systemic venous infusion of 5FU produces a higher response rate than traditional bolus 5FU schedules, with apparent enhancement of survival and easily managed toxicity.\r"

Between 1976 and 1983, 253 patients were randomised to either control (no further therapy after surgery), immunotherapy (oral bacille Calmette-Guerin [BCG] 120 mg once a month) for 5 years or chemoimmunotherapy (oral BCG as above with methyl-cyclohexyl-chloroethyl nitrosourea [meCCNU] 130 mg/m2 on day 1 and 5-fluorouracil [5-FU] 325 mg/m2/day on days 1-5 and 375 mg/m2/day on days 36-40) repeated every 10 weeks for 8 cycles. The median follow-up of patients is now 6.95 years. Of the control, immunotherapy, and chemoimmunotherapy groups 22.35%, 39.28%, and 28.57%, respectively, have relapsed. The log-rank analysis of results shows no disease-free or overall survival advantage for patients receiving adjuvant therapy compared with the control group. Patients receiving adjuvant immunotherapy for stage B2 appear to have a significantly inferior disease-free survival compared with other groups, but their overall survival is similar. There are no significant differences in disease-free or overall survival in the three groups of patients with stage C tumour. Of 82 patients dying, 78.05% died of progressive colorectal carcinoma, 13 patients developed a second malignancy; the remainder died of seemingly unrelated causes.\r"

The other 20 patients died during mechanical support because their condition could not be stabilized for transplantation, despite blood flow restoration. Fifty-six percent of the patients younger than 40 years underwent successful transplantation and six of nine patients are long-term survivors. By comparison, in the older group, 17.6% of patients underwent transplantation and one of three survived long term. Forty-four percent of patients in the acute decompensation group had successful transplantation and four of seven patients are long-term survivors. In the chronic decompensation group these figures were 29.4% and three of five patients. All patients who were heavily immunosuppressed (n = 4) died of sepsis. Transplantation was considered and performed only when the patient's condition was correct and stable. In six patients an infection developed in the immediate posttransplant period. Three of the infections were resolved with antibiotic therapy. One originated in the mediastinum and is still unresolved, although the patient's condition is improving. Another patient died of an anoxic coma caused by ventilatory problems. There were two late deaths at 14 and 19 months, one resulting from a combination of toxoplasmosis and rejection and the other from a Kaposi sarcoma caused by azathioprine treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, 80 patients having primary aorta-coronary bypass grafting received aprotinin (700 mg approximately) or saline placebo from the beginning of the procedure until skin closure. Standardized anesthetic, perfusion, and surgical techniques were used. The total loss from the thoracic drains was significantly reduced in the aprotinin group as compared with the loss in the placebo group (309 +/- 133 ml versus 573 +/- 166 ml, p less than 0.01; mean +/- standard deviation). There was a threefold difference in the total hemoglobin loss into the chest drains (aprotinin 12.0 +/- 12.6 gm versus placebo 37.7 +/- 18.3 gm). Patients of the aprotinin group received remarkably less bank blood postoperatively: 13 units total compared with 75 units. Of the 40 patients in the aprotinin group, 32 received no bank blood compared with 2 of 37 patients in the placebo group. Venous hemoglobin levels preoperatively, on day 1, and on day 7 postoperatively did not differ between the groups. At day 7 the values were 13.1 +/- 1.4 gm/dl versus 12.5 +/- 1.2 gm/dl in the aprotinin group and the placebo group, respectively. Platelet counts determined at fixed times perioperatively did not differ between the two groups. In contrast, template bleeding time measured in 32 study patients was distinctly different between groups, with a postoperative rise of 6.2 +/- 2.1 minutes in the placebo group opposed to only 1.5 +/- 1.1 minutes in the aprotinin group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In a survey of 142 hospitals in Japan, 1562 operations involving tracheobronchoplasty, 565 involving tracheoplasty, and 992 involving bronchoplasty were found to have been done from 1954 to 1984. The number of operations showed a steep increase from 1965 and reached more than 200 a year by 1984. This increase comes from larger numbers of bronchoplasty procedures being performed for lung cancer (58.8% in toto) and of tracheoplasty procedures for thyroid cancer (9.7% in toto). Fifty-seven operative modes could be classified, in which bronchial anastomosis was most frequent (62.1%), followed in order by tracheal anastomosis (18.0%), and tracheobronchial anastomosis (5.9%). Complications, encountered in 16.9% in toto, resulted in death in 22.3%, with fistula bleeding in all and anastomotic stricture in 47.7%. Anastomotic stricture alone had a higher mortality rate than anastomotic stricture combined with recurrent palsy (p less than 0.01). The tracheal anastomosis mode had a higher complication rate than that of the bronchial anastomosis mode (p less than 0.01). Among the 57 modes, the complication rates were lower than those of each stem mode in the following: suture of the tracheal wall (p less than 0.05), tracheal patch grafting (p less than 0.01), sleeve resection of the right main bronchus (p less than 0.02), and sleeve lobectomy of the right lower lobe (p less than 0.001). Complication rates were higher than those of each stem mode in these procedures: prosthetic replacement of the trachea (p less than 0.001), sleeve resection of the right main bronchus (p less than 0.05), and the montage-type carinal reconstruction (p less than 0.05) modes. The tracheal anastomosis mode was classified into two categories, standard and extensive. The latter showed complication rates higher than the former (p less than 0.01), tracheoplasty (p less than 0.0025), and the tracheal anastomosis stem mode (p less than 0.0025). Complication rates have decreased with time, being 21.8% with the tracheal anastomosis mode and 10.8% with the bronchial anastomosis mode in the past 9 years.\r"

Heart transplants (in the neck) were performed between donor vervet monkeys and recipient baboons; no immunosuppressive therapy was given. Survival in ABO-compatible pairs (group 1, n = 9) was for a mean of 10.3 (+/- 5.2) days, which was not significantly different from that in ABO-incompatible pairs (group 2, n = 9: mean survival 7.3 +/- 5.6 days). In group 2, however, three hearts were rejected hyperacutely within 60 minutes, whereas in group 1 only one heart was rejected within 24 hours (not significant). Preformed anti-vervet monkey antibody was present in only one of 18 baboons, but developed in eight others. ABO-specific antibodies were present in all nine group 2 baboons and increased in titer in six cases. Histopathologic features of vascular (humoral) rejection, sometimes associated with cellular infiltration, were seen in a majority of hearts in both groups. Though the number of animals in this study was small, ABO-incompatibility would not appear to be a major factor in cardiac xenograft survival when transplantation is performed between closely related primate species, though early hyperacute rejection would seem more likely to occur when blood group incompatibility is present.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness, in patients with known aortic or brachiocephalic arterial injury, of five previously published radiographic criteria for excluding aortography in patients with blunt chest trauma. These criteria were (1) normal findings on erect chest radiograph; (2) normal aortic arch and left subclavian artery; (3) normal aortic arch, descending aorta, aortopulmonary window, tracheal position, and left paraspinal interface; (4) normal right paratracheal stripe and nasogastric tube position, and (5) normal aortic arch and tracheal and nasogastric tube position. One or more of these criteria were met in 6% to 25% of patient with major thoracic arterial injury, depending on the criteria used. Interestingly, two (6%) patients had radiographs that showed no specific signs of mediastinal hemorrhage, which indicates that the chest radiograph is limited in its sensitivity to detect major thoracic arterial injury. Because of these results, we do not believe that attempts to limit aortography in patients with supine film evidence of mediastinal abnormality, based on the absence of certain signs of mediastinal hemorrhage, are warranted. Furthermore, an abnormal radiograph cannot be relied on as the sole criterion for aortography if the goal of care is to detect as close to 100% of vascular injuries as possible.\r"

The clinical experience to date with use of these agents as therapy in congestive heart failure is limited but does suggest a future role for beta-blockers as adjunct therapy in a select population of patients with heart failure.\r"

Experimental studies have suggested their usefulness in these areas. Clinical studies have demonstrated a role for beta-blockers in the hyperacute phase of MI, and in longterm treatment of infarct survivors. Calcium channel blockers appear to have somewhat less utility in patients with Q wave MIs, but may have an important role in therapy of the non-Q wave infarct.\r"

At the end of each treatment phase, blood pressure was monitored for 24 h and Holter and real-time electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring were carried out and an activity diary kept for 48 h. Blood samples for catecholamine measurement were taken after 30 min supine, 60 min standing, and at the first silent ischaemic event, triggered by the real-time ECG monitor, by means of an ambulatory blood withdrawal pump. Metoprolol lowered blood pressure and heart rate in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects, and reduced the frequency and duration of silent ischaemic episodes in hypertensive subjects. Plasma noradrenaline measured during silent ischaemia while the patients were resting was significantly higher than the control supine level without ischaemia. These findings suggest that noradrenergic hyperactivity may have a role in coronary vasoconstriction and that treatment which neutralizes sympathetic tone may be especially beneficial in treatment of silent ischaemia in hypertensive patients.\r"

Group I also received seven monthly injections of HB immunoglobulin (HBIg), and group II received one HBIg injection at birth. Group III received vaccine only and group IV received placebo for both vaccine and HBIg. At the age of 3 years, all infants of the three treatment groups were significantly protected against the HB virus (HBV) carrier state compared with the placebo group (p less than 0.0001); the protective efficacy rates in groups I, II, and III were 87%, 80%, and 65%, respectively. At all times, group I was significantly better protected than group III. In groups III and IV, infants of mothers with serum HBV DNA levels of 5 pg/ml or above were at a significantly higher risk of acquiring the HBV carrier state than those whose mothers had HBV DNA levels below 5 pg/ml. This difference was not significant in groups given HBIg. Of the 183 infants who initially escaped HBV infection, 73 (40%) had transient and 8 (4%) chronic HBV infection between 6 and 36 months. Vaccinated infants who had actively formed anti-HBs remained well protected against the HBV carrier state. However, infants in groups I and II with no active anti-HBs response to vaccine became at risk for the HBV carrier state when the passively acquired anti-HBs antibodies had disappeared. HBIg should be included in HB vaccination schedules for all infants of HBeAg-positive mothers.\r"

The sensitivity and specificity of echocardiography were 99% and 98%, respectively, with positive and negative predictive values of 98% and 99%. For CT sensitivity was 83%, specificity 100%, and positive and negative predictive values 100% and 86%, respectively. For aortography sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 94%, and the positive and negative predictive values 96% and 84%, respectively. Echocardiography, including the transoesophageal route, can provide accurate diagnosis of aortic dissection within 15 min. Diagnostic difficulties occur only in a few type II dissections, when complementary diagnostic procedures, including CT or angiography, may be needed. To clarify branch involvement angiography is required.\r"

DNA probes complementary (cDNA) to the Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy gene product, dystrophin, can detect molecular deletions in 60-70% of affected subjects. Thirty-three patients with BMD or LGD (thirty isolated and three with an affected brother) were screened with a panel of cDNA probes for the whole dystrophin gene. Deletions were found in thirteen of eighteen (72%) patients with a diagnosis of BMD. Deletions were also found in four of the fifteen (27%) patients previously thought to have LGD, who were therefore reclassified as having BMD. All male patients with progressive muscular dystrophy of limb-girdle pattern should be routinely screened with these cDNA probes as a useful adjunct to their clinical diagnosis since the results have important implications for genetic counselling of affected families.\r"

Serum and biliary levels were significantly higher in patients with acute rejection than in those with other complications (serum p less than 0.0025, bile p less than 0.001) or stable grafts (both p less than 0.0001). Levels rose 24 h before rejection could be detected by conventional liver tests. Biliary levels were more specific and sensitive than serum levels for rejection. Local production of IL2R accounted for the high levels in bile; the bile to serum ratio of IL2R was greater than that of albumin in 16 of 18 patients with acute rejection. Serum levels were high early in the course of chronic rejection but fell as it progressed to end-stage. Measurement of soluble IL2R may have a role in the early diagnosis of acute rejection and in identifying patients with chronic rejection in whom further immunosuppression will provide no benefit.\r"
