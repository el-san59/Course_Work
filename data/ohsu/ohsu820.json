DESIGN--Prospective study of one year's cohort of patients referred to a breast unit with special reference to the subgroup suitable for conservation management and to the proportion eligible for and (after informed consent) ultimately randomised within the Scottish early breast cancer trials. SETTING--The breast unit, Longmore Hospital, Edinburgh, during 1988. PATIENTS--All 3054 patients referred to the breast unit during the year. 324 Found to have invasive breast cancer and 147 initially thought suitable for conservation management. RESULTS--63 Patients were treated by mastectomy, 19 of whom requested mastectomy rather than conservation management. 84 Patients were excluded from trials, and of the 63 eligible patients, 40 gave informed consent. Most of the 23 patients who refused the trials requested a specific adjuvant treatment after discussion of their management and the trials. CONCLUSIONS--Recruitment to prospective trials in which informed consent is required before randomisation may be slower than predicted because of a high proportion of exclusions and also refusal by patients. Trials may therefore take longer to complete and give distorted results by virtue of the unpredictable nature of the selection of patients.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the relation between sleeping position and quantity of bedding and the risk of sudden unexpected infant death. DESIGN--A study of all infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly and of two controls matched for age and date with each index case. The parents of control infants were interviewed within 72 hours of the index infant's death. Information was collected on bedding, sleeping position, heating, and recent signs of illness for index and control infants. SETTING--A defined geographical area comprising most of the county of Avon and part of Somerset. SUBJECTS--72 Infants who had died suddenly and unexpectedly (of whom 67 had died from the sudden infant death syndrome) and 144 control infants. RESULTS--Compared with the control infants the infants who had died from the sudden infant death syndrome were more likely to have been sleeping prone (relative risk 8.8; 95% confidence interval 7.0 to 11.0; p less than 0.001), to have been more heavily wrapped (relative risk 1.14 per tog above 8 tog; 1.03 to 1.28; p less than 0.05), and to have had the heating on all night (relative risk 2.7; 1.4 to 5.2; p less than 0.01). These differences were less pronounced in the younger infants (less than 70 days) than the older ones. The risk of sudden unexpected death among infants older than 70 days, nursed prone, and with clothing and bedding of total thermal resistance greater than 10 tog was increased by factors of 15.1 (2.6 to 89.6) and 25.2 (3.7 to 169.0) respectively compared with the risk in infants of the same age nursed supine or on their side and under less than 6 tog of bedding. CONCLUSIONS--Overheating and the prone position are independently associated with an increased risk of sudden unexpected infant death, particularly in infants aged more than 70 days. Educating parents about appropriate thermal care and sleeping position of infants may help to reduce the incidence of the sudden infant death syndrome.\r"

SUBJECTS--Of 92 women doctors who had graduated from the universities of Leeds, Manchester, and Sheffield in 1986 and had been working as junior house officers for eight months 70 (76%) returned completed questionnaires. MAIN RESULTS--Mean score on the general health questionnaire was 13.79 (SD 5.20) and on the symptom checklist for depression was 1.43 (0.83). The scores of 32 subjects (46%) were above the criterion for clinical depression. Overwork was perceived as creating the most strain, followed by effects on personal life, serious failures of treatment, and talking to distressed relatives. Both stress and depression were related to effects on personal life, overwork, relations with consultants, and making decisions. Sex related sources of stress were conflicts between career and personal life, sexual harassment at work, a lack of female role models, and prejudice from patients. In addition to these, discrimination by senior doctors was related to depression. CONCLUSION--Changes are needed in the career paths of women doctors, and could be implemented.\r"

DESIGN--A controlled study in which subjects with positive findings on exercise electrocardiography, 24 hour electrocardiographic recording, or dynamic thallium scintigraphy (diabetics only) underwent coronary angiography. SETTING--Academic medical centre; referral based cardiology clinic. SUBJECTS--136 Diabetic subjects, of whom 72 (33 women, 39 men (mean age 46.0] were insulin dependent and 64 (19 women, 45 men (mean age 49.3] non-insulin dependent. 80 Controls matched for age and sex; all were clients of the Occupational Health Service of Oulu University Central Hospital or the State Occupational Health Service Station in Oulu in whom diabetes had been excluded by a glucose tolerance test. INTERVENTIONS--Any subject showing signs of myocardial ischaemia was referred for cardiac catheterization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Exercise electrocardiography and 24 hour electrocardiographic recording were regarded as positive if there were ST depressions of greater than or equal to 1 mm that were planar or downsloping and persisted for 0.08 seconds after the J point. Thallium tomographic imaging. With cardiac catheterisation, coronary artery lesions were classified as significant in half or more of the vessel lumen was narrowed, or insignificant if such narrowing was less than half. RESULTS--40 (29%) diabetes and four (5%) controls had positive results in one or more of the non-invasive tests. Coronary angiography was performed on 34 of the diabetics (six refused); 12 had significant coronary artery narrowing; seven had unimportant atherosclerosis; 15 had patent coronary arteries. Among the controls only one had unimportant atherosclerosis; the other three had patent arteries. CONCLUSIONS--These results confirm the high prevalence of asymptomatic myocardial ischaemia in diabetics. Non-invasive screening of diabetic subjects, however, does not seem justified because of the low preset probability of the presence of the disease and the inaccuracy of the available test methods.\r"

  ".W": "Detailed referral information from one practice was used to investigate the effect of calculating referral rates in several different ways. Referral rates for individual general practitioners should be related to the number of consultations carried out and not to the number of registered patients; for whole practices list size may be used as the denominator. Most doctors will not need to control for age and sex of patients when comparing referral rates but may need to control for case mix when comparing referral rates to individual specialties. In addition, a method is described for distinguishing systematic variation between the referral rates of individual doctors from the random variation that may arise from data based on fairly small numbers of referrals. The method indicates whether systematic variation is greater than would be expected by chance, and it can be extended to indicate whether variability in referral rates is greater in one specialty than another. Because of random variation with time a year's data may not be sufficient to allow reliable interpretation of referral rates to individual specialties, except for the largest. At present there is no known relation between high or low referral rates and quality of care. Nevertheless, if doctors are to interpret their own rates of referral they need those rates to be reliable and valid. Use of the 10 guidelines described in this paper will help to prevent unwarranted conclusions being drawn from information on general practitioners' rates of referral to hospital.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective study of twins and case-control study of randomly selected children conducted within a prospective cohort study. SETTING--Urban and rural areas of Guinea-Bissau. SUBJECTS--251 Pairs of twins (65 male pairs, 72 female pairs, and 114 mixed pairs), and 39 children who died and 78 controls identified in a cohort of 853 children aged less than 4, comprising 772 randomly selected children, all twins, and all children who had measles living in Bandim 2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death of a child and sex of cotwin or older sibling nearest in age. RESULTS--The mortality among children from mixed pairs of twins was higher than that among pairs of the same sex (relative risk 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.90). Boys had a slightly higher mortality especially in the older groups. In the case-control study the older sibling nearest in age was of the opposite sex for 29 (74%) of the children compared with 36 (46%) of the controls matched for age, sex, and area. Mortality was higher among both boys and girls with older siblings of the opposite sex than among those with siblings of the same sex (odds ratio 1.90, 0.78 to 4.61 v 7.5, 1.59 to 35.30), but the difference was more pronounced among girls. CONCLUSIONS--Children whose older sibling nearest in age is of the opposite sex or who have cotwins of the opposite sex have a higher mortality from infectious diseases. Further investigation is needed to determine the nature of this relation.\r"

SETTING--Aberdeen city district. SUBJECTS--1024 Women in the age group 46-50, of whom 130 had to be excluded. Of the remaining 894 women, 766 (86%) responded to the questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Response to questionnaire on pregnancy history, the length of time taken to become pregnant each time, and whether medical advice had been sought. RESULTS--Among the 766 women contacted, 602 (79%) reported no difficulties in having children, 56 (7%) had chosen not to have children, and the remaining 108 (14%) had experienced infertility, defined as having difficulty in becoming pregnant for more than two years. In total 68 (9%) women had primary infertility, of whom 41 (5%) eventually conceived. Of the 40 (5%) with secondary infertility, 23 (3%) conceived. Overall, 52 (7%) of the population were left with an unresolved problem of infertility. Only 67 (62%) infertile women had made use of hospital services, and a further 8 (7%) had consulted their general practitioners. Among those who conceived there was no difference in the proportion who sought advice compared with those who did not. CONCLUSION--The overall prevalence of infertility was 14%, although half of these women eventually conceived. Primary infertility was more common than secondary infertility. Only 62% of infertile women attended a hospital clinic for treatment of their infertility.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective audit of all cases of trauma in patients admitted to a hospital from an accident and emergency department. SETTING--Accident and emergency department in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--1577 Patients admitted with trauma, of whom 695 met the inclusion criteria for the study--that is, were admitted for more than three days, or admitted to intensive care, or died. 17 Patients were excluded because of failure to trace their notes. OUTCOME MEASURES--Review of case notes with TRISS (trauma score, injury severity score) methodology to compare expected and observed survival. RESULTS--Most (421/678) admissions were due to single orthopaedic injury. Serious injury was uncommon with only 43 patients having injury severity scores greater than 15. The calculated probability of survival matched the observed outcome for most of the seriously injured patients, with only two unexpected deaths. However, 36 of the 61 deaths in the 678 patients occurred in elderly patients with a fractured neck of the femur, and all of these patients had a high probability of survival predicted by TRISS methodology. CONCLUSIONS--Application of TRISS methodology seems to be valid for seriously injured patients except for elderly patients with single orthopaedic injuries, in whom there were major differences between observed and expected outcomes. Using outcome norms from the United States may not be applicable for this group. IMPLICATIONS--Audit of management of major injuries should be carried out by every hospital, and the methodology of the major trauma outcome study is an excellent system for carrying out such audit. The study of all patients admitted with trauma requires appreciable extra resources, but most hospitals should be able to monitor the care of seriously injured patients as their numbers are much fewer.\r"

DESIGN--Predictive study of resource utilisation based on a computerised clinical information system of five years' audit data from a surgical management system. SETTING--One surgical firm (of one consultant, one registrar, and one preregistration houseman) in a district general hospital. PATIENTS--5267 Patients whose admission records were part of the five years' audit of surgical management. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Mean length of stay; number of occupied beds; turnover interval; throughput (patients/bed); percentage elective theatre occupancy; waiting time for elective admissions; and theatre, hotel, and total costs. RESULTS--Predicted outcome was analysed in the model, taking the actual outcomes in 1988-9 as baseline values, for four clinical scenarios: an increase in accident and emergency admissions, a reduction in beds, a reduced length of stay, and creation of a new firm. Baseline values showed a mean stay of just over five days in 15 beds and with a theatre occupancy of 94%; the total cost was 812,000 pounds (hotel costs 597,000 pounds). Increasing the accident and emergency admissions to 460/year (19%), based on projected trends from 1984 to 1988, resulted in increased hotel costs (55,000 pounds) and reducing bed numbers (by halving admissions) in decreased use of theatres to 71%, decreased throughput, and increased waiting time, from 20 to 92 weeks, at a saving of 99,000 pounds (12%). Reducing stay marginally reduced bed occupancy (8%) and hotel costs (14%), and creating a new surgical team considerably reduced bed occupancy (14%) and waiting time for elective operations (by 20%). The minimum number of beds for referrals, accident and emergency admissions, and planned admissions was 9.0; that for urgent elective admissions was 3.3 and for non-urgent admissions was 2.4. CONCLUSION--A well designed clinical information system with the routine collection of data can provide the necessary output data to enable resource modelling. IMPLICATION--Use of such a model will allow clinicians to participate in resource planning on the basis of what is actually happening within the hospital.\r"

DESIGN--Pilot study of 50 surgeons selected at random followed by a postal questionnaire completed anonymously. SUBJECTS--All 1220 fellows and associates of the British Orthopaedic Association working in the United Kingdom. RESULTS--800 (67%) Questionnaires were returned. 511 Surgeons has sustained a needlestick injury or had got body fluid in their eye within the past month despite 430 regularly wearing eye protection during major surgery. Seven had definitely and four possibly been infected with hepatitis B virus by a patient while operating, and 582 had been immunised against hepatitis B. Only 75 surgeons were satisfied with the present guidelines on testing patients for HIV antibodies. CONCLUSIONS--Although most surgeons who replied took some precautions when operating, most still exposed themselves to considerable risk from patients not known to be infected with HIV or hepatitis B virus.\r"

  ".W": "Most of the research into the psychosocial impact of treatment for cancer in children has concentrated on effects on the family rather than on the children's return to school. Thus parents and teachers were questioned about the problems experienced by 117 children who returned to school after spending time in hospital. The children comprised 51 with cancer and two groups of control children (34 with chronic diseases such as renal disease and cardiac conditions and 32 with orthopaedic conditions such as thoracic scoliosis, club foot, and injuries resulting from trauma). Children in all three groups experienced problems on returning to school, the greatest number and variety occurring in the children treated for cancer and the fewest in the children with orthopaedic conditions. The variety of physical problems was greatest and the variety of academic problems was least, with psychological and behavioural problems intermediate. Several problems seemed to be related to drug treatment. Several children missed a considerable amount of full time education. Many teachers were unsure of the academic expectations and physical capabilities of children returning to school. To facilitate a smooth return to school for a child with cancer improved liaison is needed between the hospital, school, and home during the child's absence and teachers need to be better informed.\r"

DESIGN--A follow up study of infants born 50 years previously whose measurements at birth were recorded in detail. SETTING--Preston, Lancashire. SUBJECTS--449 Men and women born in hospital in Preston during 1935-43 and still living in Lancashire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Placental weight, birth weight, and blood pressure at age 46 to 54 years. RESULTS--In both sexes systolic and diastolic pressures were strongly related to placental weight and birth weight. Mean systolic pressure rose by 15 mm Hg as placental weight increased from less than or equal to 1 lb (0.45 kg) to greater than 1.5 lb and fell by 11 mm Hg as birth weight increased from less than or equal to 5.5 lb to greater than 7.5 lb. These relations were independent so that the highest blood pressures occurred in people who had been small babies with large placentas. Higher body mass index and alcohol consumption were also associated with higher blood pressure, but the relations of placental weight and birth weight to blood pressure and hypertension were independent of these influences. CONCLUSIONS--These findings show for the first time that the intrauterine environment has an important effect on blood pressure and hypertension in adults. The highest blood pressures occurred in men and women who had been small babies with large placentas. Such discordance between placental and fetal size may lead to circulatory adaptation in the fetus, altered arterial structure in the child, and hypertension in the adult. Prevention of hypertension may depend on improving the nutrition and health of mothers.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective comparison of demographic characteristics of 185 homeless women booking for delivery with those of housed women booking in the same period and with the population of North West Thames region; comparison of obstetric performance of homeless women with subgroup of the housed population (group matched for age, parity, and ethnic origin). SETTING--Consultant obstetric unit, St Mary's Hospital, London. SUBJECTS--All women booking between April 1987 and March 1988 who subsequently had a registrable birth. MAIN RESULTS--185 (8%) Of the 2308 women studied were homeless. Compared with the housed population, they had a larger proportion of young women, women of high parity, and Indo-Pakistani women and a smaller proportion of primiparas. Homeless women booked later and had had more previous obstetric problems than housed women. Pregnancy outcome (assessed by birth weight and prematurity rates) was worse than that of both women housed locally and the regional population. Antenatal attendance, complications, intrapartum performance, and perinatal outcome of homeless women did not differ from those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS--This study has been unable to show any significant differences in the outcome of pregnancy in homeless women that can be directly attributed to living in bed and breakfast accommodation, but these women have sociodemographic characteristics and obstetric risk factors that contribute to a poorer outcome in pregnancy than for the general population.\r"

DESIGN--A retrospective analysis using reports and statistics of Finnish defence forces. SETTING--Call up examinations of candidates for military conscription and examination of conscripts discharged because of poor health. SUBJECTS--Roughly 900,000 men--that is, 98% of men of conscription age--examined in 1966-89 and a proportional but unknown number examined in 1926-61. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Asthma recognised at call up examination, exemption from military service, and discharge from military service because of asthma. RESULTS--During 1926-61 the prevalence of asthma recorded at call up examinations remained steady at between 0.02% and 0.08%. Between 1961 and 1966, however, a continuous, linear rise began, the prevalence increasing from 0.29% in 1966 to 1.79% in 1989--that is, representing a sixfold increase. Compared with 1961 the rise was 20-fold. From 1966 to 1989 the sum of exemptions and discharges from military service due to asthma increased analogously sixfold. CONCLUSIONS--If the apparent increase in asthma detected in Finnish young men was due entirely to improved diagnostic methods and other confounding effects then some 95% of cases must have gone undiagnosed in the years before 1966. This seems inconceivable, which suggests that much of the increase was real. This conclusion is strengthened by the observed rise in exemptions and discharges due to asthma.\r"

DESIGN--A comparison of outpatient referral rates standardised for age and sex and rates of elective admission to hospital for six specialties individually and for all specialties combined. SETTING--19 General practices in three districts in Oxford Regional Health Authority with a combined practice population of 188 610. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Estimated proportion of outpatient referrals resulting in admission to hospital, extent of variation in referral rates and admission rates among practices, and association between admissions and outpatient referrals. RESULTS--Patients referred to surgical specialties were more likely than those referred to medical specialties to be admitted after an outpatient referral. Overall, the estimated proportion of patients admitted after an outpatient referral was 42%. There were significant differences among the practices in referral rates and admission rates for most of the major specialties. The extent of systematic variance in admission rates (0.048) was similar to that in referral rates (0.037). Referral and admission rates were significantly associated for general surgery; ear, nose, and throat surgery; trauma and orthopaedics; and all specialties combined. For most specialties the practices with higher referral rates also had higher admission rates, casting doubt on the view that these practices were referring more patients unnecessarily. CONCLUSION--Rates of elective admission to hospital vary systematically among general practices. Variations in outpatient referral rates are an important determinant of variations in admission rates.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of patients and families by questionnaire interviews in the patients' homes. SETTING--Inner London and north Kent (London suburbs). SUBJECTS--65 Patients, each with a member of their family or a career. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Ratings of eight current problems and ratings and comments on three services-hospital doctors and nurses, general practitioners and district nurses, and the support team staff-obtained after a minimum of two weeks' care from palliative care support teams. RESULTS--Effect of anxiety on the patient's nearest career. and symptom control were rated as the most severe current problems by both patients and families; a few patients and families identified other severe problems. Families' ratings of pain control, symptom control, and effect of anxiety on the patient were significantly worse than the patients' ratings (p less than 0.05). Support teams received the most praise, being rated by 58 (89%) patients and 59 (91%) of family members as good as excellent. General practitioners and district nurses were rated good or excellent by 46 (71%) patients and 46 (71%) family members, but six (9%) in each group rated the service as poor or very bad, and ratings in the inner London district were significantly worse than those in the outer London district. Hospital doctors and nurses were rated good or excellent by 22 (34%) patients and 35 (54%) of family members, and 14 (22%) patients and 15 (23%) family members rated this service as poor or very bad. Negative comments referred to communication (especially at diagnosis), coordination of services, the attitude of the doctor, delays in diagnosis, and difficulties in getting doctors to visit at home. Family members were more satisfied with the services than were patients. CONCLUSIONS--Palliative care needs to include both the patient and family because the needs of the family may exceed those of the patient. Support teams and some hospital and community doctors and nurses met the perceived needs of dying patients and families, but better education and organisation of services are needed.\r"

Imaging has an essential role in selective and pre-operative assessment. Severe otosclerosis and post-meningitic labyrinthitis ossificans are common causes of deafness in these patients and can be demonstrated by computed tomography (CT). The most suitable side for operation can be assessed. We describe our experiences with 165 patients, 69 of whom were found suitable for implants. Thin (1 mm) section CT in axial and coronal planes is the best imaging investigation of the petrous temporal bones but the place of magnetic resonance scanning to confirm that the inner ear is fluid-filled and polytomography to show a multichannel implant in the cochlea is discussed. No implants were used for congenital deformities, but some observations are made of this type of structural deformity of the inner ear.\r"

The lesions included tight, proximally located renal artery stenosis (12 stenoses; nine patients), localized abdominal aortic stenosis (two patients) and occluded left common iliac artery (one patient). Clinically successful dilatation was achieved in seven patients (10 stenoses) with renal artery stenosis, in both the patients with abdominal aortic stenosis and in the only patient with an occluded left common iliac artery. No complications related to the procedure were encountered. The follow-up period (n = 7) ranged between 1 and 16 months, mean follow-up period after renal angioplasty was 5 months and after abdominal aortic angioplasty was 12.5 months. Initial success has been maintained in both the patients with abdominal aortic stenoses and in four out of five patients with renal artery stenosis. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty offers an attractive alternative for the management of stenosing lesions in Takayasu's arteritis with good short term results.\r"

The solutions should be stored at room temperature or at 4 degrees C. The diluted barium solution was the contrast medium least contaminated and if it is not contra-indicated for other reasons should be used in preference to low osmolality water soluble contrast media on the basis of its cost, radiological contrast and low microbial contamination rate.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of continuous wave ultrasound exposures on the cytotoxicity of adriamycin has been studied. It has been found that 2.6 MHz, 2.3 Wcm-2 (spatial average) ultrasound can enhance the cell killing potential of adriamycin both in suspensions of single V79 chinese hamster fibroblast cells and in spheroids formed from these cells. The ratio of the slopes of the survival curves for single cell suspensions is 1.5. For spheroids, the growth delay is increased by 1.3 days by simultaneous ultrasound exposure. Flow cytometric studies of the intracellular concentration of adriamycin following ultrasound exposure reveals that this is increased when compared with that measured when the cells are only exposed to adriamycin. Evidence is presented to suggest that this is a non-thermal effect of ultrasound.\r"

Following intravenous administration, 5 FU decayed with \"half times\" ranging from 5 to 17 min. There was considerable variation of 5 FU pharmacokinetics between patients following intraperitoneal administration. Peritoneal contamination by infused 5 FU was considered to be a significant problem in one patient. A technique for providing superficial signal suppression was therefore investigated and its efficacy for excluding signal from the peritoneal space has been demonstrated. Owing to the potential for contamination from peritoneal 5 FU, the accumulation of fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) is a more reliable indicator of drug catabolism than the measurement of unlocalized \"hepatic\" 5 FU. Rapid intrahepatic catabolism of 5 FU to FBAL was demonstrated in all patients. However, there was greater pharmacokinetic variation following intraperitoneal administration than following intravenous administration. Therapeutic implications of intravenous compared with intraperitoneal administration of 5 FU are discussed.\r"

The uniformity of the treatment given made it possible to perform an analysis of the factors influencing the duration of the mucositis. There was no correlation with age, sex or weight loss prior to treatment. A highly significant correlation was shown with smoking during and/or after treatment (p = 0.014) and with the volume of mucosa irradiated (p = 0.025). Both appeared to act independently. It is important to encourage patients to cease smoking totally, prior to radiotherapy, to minimize the duration of mucositis associated with radiotherapy.\r"

If they find tap water unpalatable and drink bottled water instead, they could significantly increase their daily calcium intake by as much as 1.5 g. The majority of bottled waters presently available in this country, together with tap water samples from throughout the British Isles, have been analysed and the results suggest that there are some waters which stone formers should avoid.\r"

However, no study has yet compared the post-operative morbidity rates of these procedures. Tolerance, preference and post-operative symptoms in 100 patients undergoing local anaesthetic flexible cystoscopy were compared with those in 100 patients undergoing general anaesthetic rigid cystoscopy. On initial questioning, 89% of patients found flexible cystoscopy painless and 92% expressed a preference for the same procedure on a future occasion; 98 patients who underwent flexible cystoscopy and 87 who underwent rigid cystoscopy returned a questionnaire on symptoms 1 week after the procedure. The incidence of post-operative symptoms was 33% following flexible cystoscopy and 76% following rigid cystoscopy. Patients in both groups who were undergoing check cystoscopy had a lower incidence of morbidity than those undergoing cystoscopy for other reasons. The results suggest that flexible cystoscopy was well tolerated and preferred by most patients. The morbidity associated with the procedure was also significantly less than that associated with rigid cystoscopy under general anaesthesia.\r"

  ".U": "90360211\r", 
  ".W": "The sensory innervation of the rabbit urinary bladder was studied using local application of the specific sensory neurotoxin capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide). This agent has its major effect by damaging small diameter unmyelinated sensory nerves. The drug produced a 51% reduction in the bladder content of the neuropeptide substance P. It therefore appears that a substantial proportion of the bladder's content of the peptide is to be found in capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves. Cystometrograms carried out before and after treatment with capsaicin were similar; this suggests that capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves may not be of importance in the afferent limb of the micturition reflex. In vitro muscle strip studies demonstrated a small reduction in the sensitivity of the detrusor muscle to electrical stimulation of its intramural nerves. It is possible that in vitro intramural nerve stimulation leads to release of neurotransmitters from sensory as well as motor nerves. It is proposed that small diameter sensory nerves in the bladder wall may have a role in the transmission of the sensation of pain and in the triggering of inflammatory reactions rather than forming the afferent limb of the micturition reflex.\r"

By means of Cox's regression and multivariate analysis the ability of these variables to predict prognosis, i.e. death from prostatic cancer, was studied. Neopterin appeared to be the most efficient marker, followed by tumour grade, thymidine kinase and prostate specific antigen. No other variable provided information of statistical significance. In multivariate analysis thymidine kinase performed best, followed by neopterin, tumour grade and prostate specific antigen. Several serum tumour markers reflect the biological activity of human prostate cancers and their value should be further explored. They may become useful in the management of individual patients.\r"

Both radioimmunoassay (245 cases) and an enzymatic method (218 cases) were used. Using radioimmunoassay, the mean serum prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) level was significantly higher in patients with BPH than in patients with intracapsular cancer or men with normal prostates. The weight of hyperplastic tissue removed during operation in the BPH group correlated closely with PAP concentrations. Age or the presence (or absence) of an indwelling catheter had no effect on PAP concentration. Using the enzymatic method, the highest levels of acid phosphatase were also detected in patients with BPH but the difference was less marked. It was concluded that intracapsular cancer does not elevate serum acid phosphatase levels as determined by radioimmunoassay or an enzymatic method. BPH alone leads to significant rises in PAP concentrations. The degree of BPH correlates with PAP levels.\r"

While this may not reflect a true increased incidence, more cases are detected by bilateral orchiectomy. Of 916 patients with carcinoma of the prostate diagnosed and treated over a period of 10 years, 124 underwent bilateral orchiectomy. Three patients were found to have testicular metastasis, 1 being bilateral. The route of spread seems to be through the lumen and/or lymphatics of the vas deferens. Although it is a sign of advanced disease, the prognostic significance is undetermined.\r"

The mean age at orchiopexy was 9.8 years (range 7-13.6) and the mean age at follow-up was 24.3 years (range 18-41). The data showed that surgically treated cryptorchism was associated with testes that are significantly smaller than normal. The most important factor in relation to subsequent testicular size was whether or not the testes were palpable. Testes found in the superficial inguinal pouch were approximately 85% of normal testicular volume. Contralateral testicular volume in unilaterally cryptorchid patients was not significantly different from that of controls.\r"

We distributed a questionnaire to 336 consecutive patients with a complaint of chest pain seen during 1 year at an urban pediatric emergency department. Such visits represented 0.6% of all emergency encounters; the male:female ratio was 1.0. Physical examination was done in 325 patients. Chest-wall pain was the most common diagnosis (in 28% of cases). Other causes included pulmonary (in 19%), minor traumatic (in 15%), idiopathic (in 12%) and psychogenic (in 5%); miscellaneous causes (in 21%) most often indicated pain referred from the upper respiratory tract and the abdomen. The most common physical finding was chest tenderness (in 41% of cases). Investigations included chest radiography (in 50% of cases), electrocardiography (in 18%) and determination of the hemoglobin concentration and of the leukocyte count (in 13%); the results were rarely positive. Only eight patients (2%) required admission to hospital, and there were no cases of myocardial ischemia. The findings suggest that health care costs may be reduced by more judicious use of investigations. We conclude that chest pain is an uncommon and usually benign complaint in the pediatric emergency department. Most causes are evident on careful physical examination.\r"

The resulting score (as a percentage of 10 cm) was interpreted as the degree of distress associated with a particular item. 3. The possible influence on these distress scores of five factors, age, duration (time in years from diagnosis to interview), variability [recorded variability of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) expressed as amplitude per cent mean], sex and FEV1 (current and worst recorded in the clinic, expressed as per cent of predicted) was investigated. 4. From correlations of each item with age, 11/76 items were significant at P less than 0.05. Taking the results from all 76 items in a repeated measures analysis of variance, there was a small significant relationship between age and distress score (P = 0.048). The direction of the association was negative, suggesting that younger patients were less tolerant of asthma; however, the effect of age only explained 1.5% of the total variance in scores of the 76 items. 5. From correlations of visual analogue scale score for each item against duration, 10/76 items were significant at P less than 0.05, but taking the 76 items overall there was no significant association (P = 0.2). 6.

To determine if these effects occurred in vivo, four volunteers received intravenous infusions on four occasions, to give constant plasma aspirin concentrations of 0, 1, 2 and 4 mumol/l over 3 h. Infusions were performed at intervals of at least 2 weeks. 3. Before and during the infusions, blood was taken for assay of aspirin concentrations, and measurements of platelet aggregation in response to collagen, adenosine 5'-pyrophosphate and arachidonate. Thromboxane generation after stimulated platelet aggregation and whole-blood coagulation was also measured. 4. At each aspirin concentration, both platelet aggregation and thromboxane generation in response to collagen and arachidonate were inhibited progressively over the 3 h infusion period. Greatest inhibition was seen during the 4 mumol/l infusion, which produced maximal or near-maximal inhibition by the third hour. 5. Thromboxane generated during whole-blood coagulation was similarly inhibited in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner throughout all aspirin infusions. 6. The progressive nature of the inhibition of platelet function with these low aspirin concentrations may be due to either slow aspirin transport across the platelet membrane or delayed interaction with cyclo-oxygenase.\r"

Laser Doppler flowmetry has been used to study changes in cutaneous erythrocyte flux produced in the hand (i) on successive immersion of the contralateral hand in water at 20 degrees C (cold test) and then in water at 0-4 degrees C (cold pressor test), and (ii) by mental arithmetic. 2. In 11 subjects, placing the right hand in water at 20 degrees C for 2 min induced a significant decrease in cutaneous erythrocyte flux in the contralateral hand and a significant fall in mean arterial pressure. Cutaneous vascular resistance, calculated as arterial pressure/cutaneous erythrocyte flux, showed no significant change. Thus, the decrease in erythrocyte flux was apparently due to a fall in perfusion pressure. 3. Subsequent immersion of the right hand in water at 0-4 degrees C for 2 min caused a significant decrease in erythrocyte flux in the contralateral hand and a significant rise in mean arterial pressure. It is concluded that the cold pressor response evoked from one hand elicited a substantial reflex vasoconstriction in the skin of the other hand; accordingly, calculated cutaneous vascular resistance increased significantly. 4. Eight subjects performed mental arithmetic for two periods of 2 min separated by a rest period of 2 min. By the end of the second minute of each period of mental arithmetic there was a significant decrease in erythrocyte flux. Mean arterial pressure increased significantly in the first period only, but calculated cutaneous vascular resistance increased in both periods, consistent with cutaneous vasoconstriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Average pressure at the apex of the capillary was found to be elevated in the patients with hypertension (21.1 +/- 4.9 mmHg compared with 13.0 +/- 2.0 mmHg in the control subjects; mean +/- SD, P less than 0.01). If the two groups were combined, there was an overall correlation between average capillary pressure and mean blood pressure (r = 0.68, P less than 0.01, n = 18), but within each group separately there was no significant relation between these parameters. 3. There were also abnormalities in the waveforms of pulsations in capillary pressure in the group with hypertension, with an increased attenuation of high-frequency harmonics. Pulses appeared to be conducted more rapidly along the vascular tree in the patients with hypertension. 4. The elevation of capillary pressure in essential hypertension demonstrated in this study is in agreement with indirect evidence of capillary hyperfiltration provided by other studies which showed a reduced plasma volume and increased transcapillary escape rate of plasma proteins. 5. The finding of elevated capillary pressure demands the inclusion of the postcapillary segment (and possibly vascular density) in the resistance equation in essential hypertension.\r"

Continuous orthostatic responses of blood pressure and heart rate were measured in 40 healthy and active elderly subjects over 70 years of age in order to assess the time course and rapidity of orthostatic cardiovascular adaptation in old age. 2. During the first 30 s (initial phase) the effects of active standing and passive head-up tilt closely resembled those observed earlier in younger age groups. Standing up was accompanied by a drop (mean +/- SD) in systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 26 +/- 13 mmHg and 12 +/- 18 mmHg, respectively, at around 10 s, and a subsequent rise up to 11 +/- 17 mmHg and 8 +/- 6 mmHg above supine values at around 20 s. The drop in blood pressure upon standing was accompanied by a transient increase in heart rate with a maximum of 13 beats/min, followed by a gradual decrease to 7 beats/min above supine levels. These characteristic transient changes were absent upon a passive head-up tilt. 3. After 1-2 min of standing (early steady-state phase) diastolic blood pressure and heart rate increased significantly after active and passive postural changes. On average, for all subjects systolic blood pressure tended to increase from control during 5-10 min standing, reaching a significant difference at 10 min. During standing, the largest increases in systolic blood pressure were found in subjects with the lowest supine blood pressures. 4. In conclusion, for the investigation of orthostatic circulatory responses in elderly subjects the following factors have to be taken into account: active versus passive changes in posture, the timing of the blood pressure reading, and the level of supine blood pressure.\r"

We investigated aerobic metabolism during exercise using indirect calorimetry in 15 patients with chronic cardiac failure and in 14 control subjects. Subjects exercised on a treadmill for 20 min at a steady-state submaximal workload. 2. Venous lactate levels were relatively constant throughout the exercise, although they were slightly greater in the patients with chronic cardiac failure than in the control subjects. The respiratory exchange ratio was lower in patients with chronic cardiac failure (0.777 +/- 0.021 vs 0.833 +/- 0.037, means +/- SD; P less than 0.0002, Mann-Whitney U-test). Relative fat utilization, expressed as a percentage of total energy expenditure, was therefore greater in patients with chronic cardiac failure (71.8 +/- 7.0 vs 54.1 +/- 12.3%, P less than 0.0005) and this was mirrored in a lower carbohydrate utilization (24.7 +/- 6.5 vs 43.3 +/- 12.1%, P less than 0.0002). Levels of free fatty acids, glycerol and noradrenaline were greater in patients with chronic cardiac failure. 3. We conclude that there is an increased reliance on fat, as opposed to carbohydrate, metabolism during exercise in chronic cardiac failure, and that this may relate to the elevated catecholamine and free fatty acid levels present. This may be a compensatory mechanism to preserve muscle glycogen stores, but as fat utilization is less efficient in terms of oxygen consumed, this shift may further impair exercise capacity.\r"

  ".W": "1. The effect of hyperuricosuria, simulated by increasing the concentration of dissolved urate, on the crystallization of calcium oxalate in human urine was examined. 2. Twenty urine samples were studied. Ten of these, designated type A, spontaneously precipitated calcium oxalate dihydrate crystals upon the addition of a solution of sodium urate solution which raised the median urate concentration from 3.1 to 7.0 mmol/l. 3. Adding dissolved urate to the remaining type B samples raised the median urate concentration from 2.2 to 6.2 mmol/l, but did not cause the precipitation of calcium oxalate. This was induced in these samples by the addition of a standard load of oxalate above an empirically determined metastable limit. 4. In the type B urine samples, the addition of urate decreased the median metastable limit from 125 to 66 mumol of oxalate, trebled the median volume of crystalline calcium oxalate deposited from 35,000 to 105,000 microns3/microliters and significantly increased the overall size of the particles precipitated. Calcium oxalate monohydrate was exclusively precipitated, and the individual crystals deposited in the presence of urate were markedly smaller, more numerous, and more highly aggregated than those produced in its absence. 5. These results constitute the most convincing evidence yet obtained that hyperuricosuria may be a powerful promoter of calcium oxalate stone formation.\r"

  ".W": "1. High fractional reabsorption of lithium occurs when rats and dogs are given a low sodium diet. This has been suggested to be due to the low tubular fluid sodium to lithium concentration ratio which arises during sodium restriction allowing transport mechanisms along the distal nephron segment to accept significant quantities of lithium instead of sodium by simple competition. 2. Clearance experiments in conscious water-loaded Wistar rats maintained on either a low sodium (6 mmol/kg) or a normal sodium (120 mmol/kg) diet were performed. The rats were infused with a solution of 120 mmol/l glucose and 10 mmol/l NaCl at a rate of 6 ml/h. 3. The median fractional excretion of lithium was 19.4% in the group with a normal sodium intake, and 2.5% in the group given a low sodium diet. The urine to plasma concentration ratio of lithium was 2.5 in the normal sodium group and 0.4 in the sodium-restricted group. The urinary sodium to lithium concentration ratio was 13 in the control group and 63 in the sodium-restricted group. 4. It is concluded that the increased fractional reabsorption of lithium initiated by a low sodium intake is not likely to be due to simple competition at distal tubular nephron sites between lithium and sodium.\r"

In comparison with control subjects, renal stone-formers showed a significantly higher oxalate self-exchange, a lower erythrocyte membrane glycosaminoglycan content and a higher membrane phosphorylation rate. In stone-formers, erythrocyte glycosaminoglycan content correlated inversely with both oxalate flux rate and protein phosphorylation. In vitro, heparan sulphate promoted a significant fall in the rate of oxalate self-exchange. 4. These findings support the hypothesis that a lower erythrocyte membrane content of glycosaminoglycans enhances membrane protein phosphorylation, leading to an increased rate of transmembrane oxalate flux.\r"

The urinary excretion of active and inactive kallikrein was studied in volunteers during diuresis induced by water loading or oral frusemide and during antidiuresis induced by desamino-D-arginine-vasopressin. 2. During acute oral water loading, excretion of active kallikrein was unchanged, despite high urine flow rates and low urine osmolalities being achieved. Excretion of inactive kallikrein correlated with the urine flow rate. 3. After desamino-D-arginine-vasopressin in eight water-loaded and six normally hydrated subjects, excretion of inactive kallikrein also correlated with the urine flow rate. There were no significant changes in the excretion of active kallikrein. 4. After frusemide there was a small transient increase in excretion of active kallikrein 1-2 h after dosing which coincided with the maximum diuresis and natriuresis. Excretion of inactive kallikrein again correlated with urine flow rate but the regression relationship between the two variables was different for water-load-induced and frusemide-induced diuresis. 5. These studies do not support a role for urinary kallikrein in the modulation of the antidiuretic action of vasopressin, but suggest that it may contribute to the natriuretic action of frusemide.\r"

Catheters were inserted into pulmonary and brachial arteries and into the hepatic and subclavian veins. Cardiac output was determined according to the Fick principle, and splanchnic blood flow was measured by using extraction of Indocyanine Green. Skin blood flow was estimated by a laser Doppler technique, calf blood flow by venous occlusion plethysmography and skeletal muscle and adipose tissue blood flow by a local isotope clearance technique. 3. Adenosine (infused in steps from 40 to 80 micrograms min-1 kg-1 into a central vein) elicited a gradual reduction in the peripheral vascular resistance to less than 50% of the basal level. There was a slight increase in the systemic blood pressure, but the pulmonary arterial and the ventricular filling pressures were unchanged. Cardiac output was doubled, accomplished by a combination of a positive chronotropic effect and an increase in stroke volume, which may be secondary to diminished peripheral resistance. 4. Skin blood flow increased by 100% at 50 micrograms of adenosine min-1 kg-1, whereas splanchnic blood flow rose significantly at 60 micrograms of adenosine min-1 kg-1. Blood flow in the calf, gastrocnemius muscle and adipose tissue did not change significantly. 5. Arterial concentrations of noradrenaline and adrenaline increased by 62 and 43%, respectively, during infusion of adenosine. Arterial levels of glycerol were depressed by more than 50%, but those of glucose and pyruvate were unchanged. 6. In conclusion, exogenous adenosine caused a marked systemic vasodilatation, with different responsiveness in the investigated vascular beds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dexamethasone resulted in negative nitrogen balance, and produced increases in the plasma concentrations of alanine (23.4%) and insulin (158%) but a decrease in the plasma concentration of glutamine (28.7%). 3. Dexamethasone treatment increased the rate of glutamine production in muscle, skin and adipose tissue preparations, with muscle production accounting for over 90% of total glutamine produced by the hindlimb. 4. Blood flow and arteriovenous concentration difference measurements across the hindlimb showed an increase in the net exchange rates of glutamine (25.3%) and alanine (90.5%) in dexamethasone-treated rats compared with corresponding controls. 5. Dexamethasone treatment produced significant decreases in the concentrations of skeletal muscle glutamine (51.8%) and 2-oxoglutarate (50.8%). The concentrations of alanine (16.2%), pyruvate (45.9%), ammonia (43.3%) and inosine 5'-phosphate (141.8%) were increased. 6. The maximal activity of glutamine synthetase was increased (21-34%), but there was no change in that of glutaminase, in muscles of dexamethasone-treated rats. 7. It is concluded that glucocorticoid administration enhances the rates of release of both glutamine and alanine from skeletal muscle of rats (both in vitro and in vivo). This may be due to changes in efflux and/or increased intracellular formation of glutamine and alanine.\r"

The contraction and relaxation responses to the polyoxyethylated vehicles currently used for the intravenous and oral administration of cyclosporin A in allograft recipients were studied in isolated rat aorta. The results were compared with those obtained with commercially available cyclosporin A for intravenous administration. 2. None of these compounds affected resting tension, noradrenaline-induced contraction or endothelium-independent relaxation produced by sodium nitroprusside or bumetanide. However, they all reversed the relaxation induced by acetylcholine, carbamylcholine or adenosine 5'-triphosphate, by a factor of approximately 66%. 3. This reversal of relaxation was unaffected by indomethacin and did not require the presence of cyclosporin A in the vehicles, and was completely abolished by L-arginine (3 x 10(-5) mol/l). 4. It is concluded that vehicles used for commercial preparations of cyclosporin A interfere with the synthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor at an early stage during which L-arginine is made available for enzymatic degradation.\r"

Some tests of mental function paradoxically improve during short periods of oxygen withdrawal in patients on long-term oxygen therapy, although the mechanism of this response is unknown. 2. To evaluate the effects of transient hypoxaemia on plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline levels, we studied eight oxygen-dependent patients who underwent either a 4 h period of oxygen withdrawal or their routine therapy, in a randomized, blinded fashion, on 2 separate days. 3. Plasma noradrenaline did not differ at baseline between study days. During normoxic conditions, plasma noradrenaline levels did not increase significantly with time. By contrast, under hypoxic conditions, plasma levels of noradrenaline rose significantly from 0 to 4 h (P less than 0.05). The magnitude of the noradrenaline response was correlated with baseline noradrenaline such that subjects with the highest resting levels had the largest increase during hypoxia (r = 0.95, P less than 0.001). 4. Plasma adrenaline did not differ at baseline between study days and there were no significant effects of hypoxia on plasma adrenaline levels. 5. We conclude that the sympathetic nervous system, but not the adrenal medulla, is stimulated in chronically oxygen-dependent subjects made acutely hypoxaemic. The magnitude of this stimulation appears to be related to the state of sympathetic nervous system activity at baseline. Improvement in some tests of mental function during transient periods of oxygen withdrawal may be due to non-specific arousal caused by a catecholamine surge.\r"

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between the response of serum interleukin-6 to surgery, the type of surgical procedure performed and the response of serum C-reactive protein. 2. Timed venous blood samples were taken from 26 patients in five broad surgical categories (minor surgery, cholecystectomy, hip replacement, colorectal surgery and major vascular surgery). C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were measured in each sample. 3. Serum interleukin-6 rose within 2-4 h of incision in all patients and the magnitude of the response differed among the various surgical groups. The response of interleukin-6 correlated (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001) with the duration of surgery. In contrast, serum C-reactive protein was not detectable after minor surgery (less than 10 mg/l) and the response of C-reactive protein did not differ among the more major surgical groups. The response of interleukin-6 showed a weak, but significant, correlation with the response of C-reactive protein (r = 0.67, P less than 0.001). 4. We conclude that serum interleukin-6 is a sensitive, early marker of tissue damage. In general, the greater the surgical trauma, the greater the response of serum interleukin-6 and the greater the peak serum concentration of interleukin-6. Our results are consistent with a role for interleukin-6 in the induction of C-reactive protein synthesis.\r"

In order to develop an improved differential sugar absorption test for simultaneously assessing intestinal permeability and lactose intolerance, methods were established for determining raffinose, lactose and L-arabinose in human urine. Using NAD(P)H-coupled enzymatic assays and fluorimetry, each sugar was measurable over a concentration range of approximately 3-300 mumol/l in diluted urine specimens. 2. After an overnight fast, 40 normal volunteers drank an iso-osmotic solution containing raffinose, lactose and L-arabinose. The median 5 h urinary sugar excretion was 0.26% of the ingested raffinose, 0.05% of lactose and 17.5% of L-arabinose. 3. In 143 patients with gastrointestinal disease, excretion of both ingested raffinose and lactose was significantly increased in coeliac disease in relapse or in partial remission and in Crohn's disease, but not in the irritable bowel syndrome, coeliac disease in remission or ulcerative colitis. Excretion of lactose, but not raffinose, was increased in patients with mucosal lactase deficiency, whereas excretion of L-arabinose was reduced in all disease groups except ulcerative colitis. 4. Discrimination between diseases was poor when based on individual sugar recoveries, but improved dramatically when excretion was expressed relative to that of L-arabinose. The raffinose/L-arabinose excretion ratio, an index of intestinal permeability, was greater than 0.08 in 15/15 untreated coeliac patients but less than 0.06 in all normal subjects and in 9/9 lactase-deficient patients, 15/16 recovered coeliac patients, 5/6 patients with ulcerative colitis, 13/16 patients with Crohn's disease and 61/62 patients with irritable bowel syndrome.\r"

Diagnoses at the time of presentation included pilonidal disease (28 percent), anal fistula (37 percent), and perirectal abscess (16 percent). Associated medical conditions included diabetes (12 percent) and obesity (12 percent), and 70 percent of the patients were smokers. Once the correct diagnosis was established, 72 percent of patients had wide local excision with healing by secondary intention, and 28 percent of patients had incision and drainage or limited local excision. Although 67 percent of the patients had recurrence of disease after initial treatment, wide excision was more successful in preventing recurrence. Skin grafting failed uniformly, and colostomy was rarely necessary. Despite its relatively common occurrence, perianal hidradenitis suppurativa is infrequently diagnosed correctly and recurs in many patients despite appropriate surgical treatment, making the disease a source of frustration for surgeon and patient alike.\r"

  ".U": "90360754\r", 
  ".W": "Faced with the responsibility of treating patients with invasive distal rectal cancer who were medically unacceptable for the indicated radical surgery, a prospective study was initiated in which high dose preoperative radiation and full-thickness local excision were used. High dose preoperative radiation permitted full-thickness local excision of select cancers, which, by conventional standards, otherwise would have required radical surgery and permanent colostomy. Feasibility was measured on the basis of safety of the technique, control of the cancer, and the quality of anal sphincter function expected. Patients were selected initially because of their predicted inability to tolerate radical surgery, but indications were broadened to include those whose tumors had completely disappeared after irradiation. From 1984 to 1988, 20 patients underwent 21 operative procedures for cancers located between 0 and 7 cm from the anorectal ring. This report is concerned with the 14 patients of this group who were observed for a minimum of 24 months. High-dose preoperative radiation was administered for a total dose of 4500 cGy. Excision and repair were performed 4 to 6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. Full-thickness disc or hemicircumferential excision was accomplished by transanal, transsphincteric, and transsacral techniques, which included, in several instances, excision of the sphincter mechanism and perineal body, and/or the vaginal wall. Full-thickness local excision after high-dose radiation therapy for rectal cancers has never been reported. Follow-up observation ranged from 24 to 48 months with a median of 31 months. Rectal reservoir function and sphincter control were good in 13 patients. Local recurrence developed in three patients (21 percent), two of whom had postradiation therapy B2 mucinous cancers. Three-year actuarial rate of local recurrence is 23 percent. One (7 percent) patient died of recurrent disease. Actuarial Kaplan-Meier survival at 3 years is 61 percent. Based on the results of this small, select patient group, high-dose radiation therapy followed by full-thickness local excision appears to be a reasonable option for patients who cannot tolerate radical surgery. This bimodal approach also may serve as an option for those who are good medical risks, but for whom sphincter preservation is at stake, and to whom radical surgery offers limited benefits.\r"

The primary tumor was located in the colon in 14 patients and in the upper third of the rectum in 11 patients, thus indicating blood drainage directed toward the portal vein (Group I). In 10 and 9 cases, respectively, the initial growth was in the middle and lower thirds of the rectum with the venous outflow at least partially directed into the vena cava (Group II). There was no obvious difference between the two groups regarding the initial site of cancer relapse. The liver was involved in 4 of 15 patients failing in Group I as opposed to 4 of 13 patients with hematogenous relapse in Group II. Median survival and tumor-free survival times were significantly longer in patients in Group I (58.4 and 50.2 months) than in patients in Group II (30.9 and 16.8 months), and, even more pronounced, in colon cancer patients (75.4 and 60.2 months) when compared with rectal cancer patients (31.0 and 17.9 months). In contrast, survival curves did not differ significantly if either the two groups with different routes of drainage (5-year survival 53 percent vs. 38 percent, 5-year tumor-free survival 43 percent vs. 37 percent), or tumors of the colon and rectum (5-year survival 67 percent vs. 38 percent, 5-year tumor-free survival 60 percent vs. 32 percent) were compared using the log-rank test. Similar trends were obtained for the subgroup of 34 patients without previous or simultaneous extrapulmonary recurrent disease at the time of lung resection. The primary tumor site does therefore not become a major criterion in selecting patients for surgical resection.\r"

  ".W": "The bowel sounds of 21 patients with mechanical obstruction of the intestine were studied. A computer analysis of bowel sounds was performed using a signal processor. Bowel sounds of patients were classified into 3 types (Types I, II, and III) based on the histograms, although these were not distinguishable on auscultation. The lower, peak, and upper frequencies were 173 +/- 25 Hz, 273 +/- 64 Hz, and 667 +/- 58 Hz, respectively, in Type I; 309 +/- 121 Hz, 632 +/- 94 Hz, and 878 +/- 116 Hz, respectively, in Type II; and 330 +/- 120 Hz, 612 +/- 86 Hz, and 766 +/- 82 Hz, respectively, in Type III. High frequency sounds above 900 Hz were recorded in Types I and II but not in Type III. The ratio of the operated patients was 0, 23, and 100 percent in Types I, II, and III, respectively. The intervals between the times of admission and operation were 4.3 days and 1.2 days in Types II and III, respectively. Thus, it appears that the methods described by the authors could provide a very objective assessment of the severity and help determine the treatment (conservative or operative) of each patient.\r"

Patients with acute pilonidal abscesses or with complex or multiple recurrent pilonidal disease were excluded from this study. The average healing time was four weeks and the average length of hospital stay was one day. The overall recurrence rate was 8 percent (12 of 150 patients). The method of management most commonly used was fistulotomy with marsupialization of the sinus tract or cyst wall (125 of 150 patients). This simple and effective technique gave excellent results with a 6 percent recurrence rate (7 of 125 patients). On the basis of their experience, the authors propose that chronic pilonidal disease usually can be treated successfully on a same day surgery basis with fistulotomy, minimal excision, and marsupialization.\r"

In patients suffering from this syndrome, the vaginal drainage is impaired because of a pouch caused by adhesions formed between the coccyx and the vagina, and an angulation of the upper part of the vagina. Surgical treatment consists of extirpation of the coccyx, separation of the posterior fornix from the lower part of the sacrum, and interposition of muscle flaps from the right and left gluteus maximus muscle, which shifts the vagina to a more vertical position. The authors report the results of this procedure in nine women observed for more than two years. Wound infection occurred in two patients, and one underwent a second operation because of relapsing symptoms. Eight patients were relieved of impaired drainage of the vagina; one patients empties her menstrual blood by straining. Dyspareunia disappeared in all patients. The operation can be recommended in patients with \"the horizontal vagina syndrome.\"\r"

Remnants of the original mucosal epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and hypertrophic autonomous nerve plexuses were noted. Nerve fibers were interwoven with the matrix of the polyps. Mast cells were closely linked with vessels, nerves, and collagen fibers. They may have an important role in the excessive granulation, angiogenesis, and fibrotic process in giant inflammatory polyps.\r"

This patient series includes over 700 severely constipated patients with over 70 percent overall therapeutic success. Cinedefecography, pelvic floor electromyography, and determination of rectoanal inhibitory reflex were performed with simple and readily available equipment to document outlet anatomy and dynamics. Colonic transit time was examined in patients whose defecography and electromyography results were nondiagnostic and/or whose response to medical management was suboptimal, using a commercially available marker capsule, followed by abdominal x-rays. Retention of markers throughout the colon suggested colonic hypomotility or \"inertia\"; rectosigmoid retention confirmed functional outlet obstruction. With careful history, physical examination, and exclusion of organic causes, orderly application of readily available techniques can afford rapid, objective, and anatomically specific evidence upon which treatment of disordered defecation may be based.\r"

Postprandial motility after a 1700-kJ meal and nighttime fasting motility were recorded in 19 healthy young adults. A comprehensive statistical approach was worked out to illuminate the statistical properties of fasting motility data from long-term studies. Separate quantifications of the variation within and between individuals are presented for the migrating motor complex (MMC). The overall mean for the MMC period was 107 min, with incomplete periods included as censored data. Standard deviation within individuals was 49 min, and standard deviation between individuals 16 min. Presented in the same manner, phase III in the proximal jejunum lasted 5.3 min, with standard deviations of 1.5 and 1.1 min, respectively. The propagation velocity of phase III in the distal duodenum was 10.8 cm/min, with standard deviations of 3.7 and 4.1 cm/min, respectively. Fed-state lasted 324 +/- 110 min (mean +/- SD), and adjusted fed-state, an alternative definition proposed in this study, 290 +/- 80 min. This variance component model, extended to handle censored data, provides a useful statistical approach for the analyses of the MMC. The MMC period proved to be less suitable for quantitative comparisons because of dominating intraindividual variance. Comparisons presented indicate that discrepancies in reference values depend, to a great extent, on the statistical methods applied.\r"

The patients were studied within two weeks before surgery and at six months postoperatively. After surgery basal gallbladder volumes were larger than preoperatively (P less than 0.02). Integrated postprandial gallbladder contraction was not significantly affected by gastrectomy, either in the patients with Billroth II anastomosis (2276 +/- 268 vs 1985 +/- 362%/60 min) or in those with Roux-en-Y anastomosis (2045 +/- 327 vs 2445 +/- 352%/60 min) when studied pre- and postoperatively, respectively. Similarly, integrated postprandial plasma CCK secretion was not significantly changed by either Billroth II gastrectomy (200 +/- 31 vs 166 +/- 21 pM/60 min) or Roux-en-Y gastrectomy (146 +/- 26 vs 147 +/- 12 pM/60 min). However, integrated postprandial PP secretion was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower after Billroth II gastrectomy (6.8 +/- 2.4 vs 2.2 +/- 1.0 nM/60 min), while the reduction in plasma PP after Roux-en-Y gastrectomy just failed to reach statistical significance (6.0 +/- 1.5 vs 3.4 +/- 0.9 nM/60 min). Similarly, the PP response, but not the gallbladder response, to an intravenous bolus injection of 1 IDU CCK/kg body weight was significantly decreased after gastrectomy independent of the type of anastomosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The stimulation of PP secretion during bombesin (11.0 +/- 1.6 nM/hr) and after the meal (8.9 +/- 2.0 nM/hr) were significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than during infusion of the CCK analog cerulein (2.7 +/- 0.4 nM/hr). CR-1409 significantly inhibited the bombesin- and meal-stimulated PP secretion to 2.0 +/- 0.4 nM/hr (81%; P less than 0.05) and 3.1 +/- 1.2 nM/hr (47%; P less than 0.05), respectively, while the cerulein-stimulated PP release was almost abolished to 0.2 +/- 0.1 nM/hr (93%; P less than 0.05) by the drug. These findings point to an important role for CCK in the regulation of bombesin- and meal-stimulated PP secretion.\r"

The data suggest that regurgitation of contrast media into the blood during intraoperative cholangiography does not depend solely on injection pressure. Moreover the data suggest that in order to prevent adverse reactions to accidental intravenous contrast administration nonionic contrast media should be used in most, if not all, radiographic studies as some contrast media reaches the bloodstream.\r"

The radionuclide rapidly visualizes the gallbladder, with activity continuing to rise during the 60 minutes after injection. The gallbladder emptied in a dose-response manner to the intravenous administration of the octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-OP). An infusion of 10 ng/kg/min of CCK-OP resulted in 75% emptying of the gallbladder at 30 min compared to control. This was significantly greater emptying than with an infusion of either 0.1 or 1.0 ng/kg/min. After administration of a fatty meal, the 30-min gallbladder emptying was 73% of control, similar to the response to CCK-OP at a dose of 10 ng/kg/min. Intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg of L-364,718 (a CCK-receptor antagonist) completely inhibited the gallbladder response to a fatty meal but had no effect on gallbladder filling in the fasting state. These results suggest that feline cholescintigraphy can be used for the quantitative study of gallbladder emptying. While CCK appears to be the primary modulator of gallbladder contraction after a fatty meal, no influence of CCK was detected in the interdigestive (fasting) state.\r"

The concentration of AF-AAT (milligrams per deciliter) was significantly elevated (P less than 0.001) in hepatoma (174 +/- 123), malignant liver disease (232 +/- 119) and peritoneal neoplasms (376 +/- 106) in comparison with cirrhotics (66 +/- 33). In separating ascites caused by cirrhosis or malignancy, AF-AAT (discriminating limit of 120 mg/dl) had a 96% sensitivity, 95% specificity, and 96% diagnostic efficacy, which was superior to the 87% observed for AF-TP and 86% for the SAAG. Similar results were obtained for the A/S AAT ratio but this test was not available in all patients. AF-AAT was particularly useful in patients with malignancy causing portal hypertension as assessed by SAAG (hepatoma, malignant liver disease). We conclude that AF-AAT may be a valuable parameter in the differential diagnosis of ascites.\r"

A decreased HBV-DNAp level of less than 100 cpm/ml three to five weeks after withdrawal was considered a sign of efficacy and was shown in 10 patients (50%). Significant differences were found between ALT levels, between T3 levels, and between the T3/T4 ratios assayed in the third and fourth weeks in total (P less than 0.02) and in the group in which efficacy was demonstrated (P less than 0.01). The T3/T4 ratio in the third week in the effectively treated group was significantly less than that in the noneffectively treated group (P less than 0.05). Prednisolone withdrawal effective for HBV-DNAp was shown in the patients with a decreased T3 level and the T3/T4 ratio at the third week and an increase in the ATL level after the withdrawal. The ALT level increased after the T3 level decreased. Changes in the T3 level or the T3/T4 ratio represent a marker for effectiveness of prednisolone withdrawal and for determination of combination therapy after steroid withdrawal.\r"

  ".W": "Increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor linked with abnormalities of chromosome 7 has been described in a number of malignancies, but not in premalignant lesions. We report on one patient of nine studied with Barrett's esophagus who had trisomy 7 and showed increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the protooncogene c-erb-B, which encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, was not amplified. However, increased expression of the corresponding mRNA was evident on dot blot analysis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding studies were consistent with increased expression of the receptor with approximately 2.3 x 10(5) molecules of EGF bound per cell. These data suggest that chromosome 7 abnormalities can occur in Barrett's esophagus.\r"

  ".U": "90360782\r", 
  ".W": "Antacids show gastroprotective action against various irritants in experimental animals and enhance the healing of chronic gastroduodenal ulcers in humans but the mechanisms of these effects are unknown. The present study was designed to determine whether prostaglandin (PG) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), which also have protective and antiulcer properties, contribute to the action of antacids on rat's stomach. It was found that Maalox 70 and its active component, Al(OH)3, enhance significantly the healing of chronic gastric and duodenal ulcers observed during 7 and 14 days after their induction. Pretreatment with indomethacin caused a significant prolongation of ulcer healing, and this was accompanied by a significant reduction in PG and EGF formation, suggesting that both factors may be involved in ulcer healing. Maalox and Al(OH)3 failed to prevent the suppression of PG by indomethacin but were equally effective in ulcer healing in rats without and with indomethacin administration, suggesting that endogenous PG may not play any important role in the healing process by these drugs. Removal of salivary glands, the major source of EGF, also prolonged ulcer healing but, again, Maalox was as effective in ulcer healing as in rats with intact salivary glands. Our findings that Maalox at pH above 3.0 binds significant amounts of EGF, enhances the binding of EGF to the ulcer area, and stimulates mucosal growth, suggest that EGF may be involved in ulcer healing; however, because antacids are also effective after sialoadenectomy, EGF does not seem to be the major factor in ulcer healing by these drugs.\r"

In this study we have used quantitative histological criteria to evaluate the ability of these drugs to be cytoprotective and have compared their effects with that of natural prostaglandin E2 (PG). The standard rat model, with injury by instillation of 1 ml of absolute ethanol, has been used. Putative cytoprotective agents were administered 15 min prior to ethanol. Each animal was sacrificed 15 min after ethanol exposure. The stomach was removed and studied using an established quantitative histological technique. This technique provides a measure of the surface area of mucosa damaged and of the volume of mucosa damaged. Ethanol alone caused damage to 76% of the area of the rat stomach and 14% of the volume of the rat gastric mucosa. Pretreatment by PG (25 micrograms/ml) resulted in reduction of the area of damage to 45% and reduction of the percentage volume damage to 2.2%. The synthetic analog of PGE2, Enprostil (1 microgram/ml) achieved similar protective effects. With pretreatment with colloidal bismuth subcitrate (10 mg/kg) or sucralfate (25 mg/kg), no protection against the surface area damaged by ethanol was seen, but there was a marked reduction of the volume of mucosa damaged. Indomethacin pretreatment augmented the damage caused by ethanol. The protective effects of colloidal bismuth subcitrate and sucralfate were not blocked by pretreatment with indomethacin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We investigated the effect of plaunotol on postprandial gastrin release, comparing it to the effect of exogenous secretin in a physiological dose in eight healthy volunteers. Four sets of experiments were performed in each volunteer: (1) meal alone, (2) meal after intravenous ranitidine (50 mg), (3) meal after oral administration of plaunotol (320 mg) in addition to ranitidine, and (4) meal after ranitidine with simultaneous intravenous infusion of secretin (0.03 CU/kg/hr). The postprandial increase in plasma secretin concentration was significantly reduced by ranitidine, while postprandial gastrin release was markedly exaggerated. Plaunotol in combination with ranitidine significantly increased secretin release and inhibited gastrin release after a meal. Intravenous infusion of secretin resulted in significant suppression of postprandial gastrin release exaggerated by ranitidine. The present study indicates that plaunotol inhibits postprandial gastrin release by its unique secretin-releasing action.\r"

The in vitro contractile responses of both longitudinal and circular muscle to the mixed muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic agonist carbachol were determined 15, 30, and 45 days after localized myenteric plexus ablation. Denervated longitudinal muscle exhibited decreased responsiveness to carbachol at all times examined. Denervated circulated muscle was initially supersensitive, but with time became subsensitive. These changes probably reflect the loss of the nicotinic (neuronal) component of the action of carbachol. Muscle orad to the site of denervation appeared subsensitive, while muscle caudad to the lesion was supersensitive (circular) or unaffected (longitudinal). These results suggest that there are changes in ascending and descending neural pathways. Alterations in the cholinergic responsiveness of intestinal smooth muscle, both at and beyond the site of myenteric plexus ablation, may result in altered intestinal motility that could lead to functional obstruction.\r"

The prevalence and biological significance of extrahepatic infection in humans remains undetermined. To characterize the tissue distribution and physical state of extrahepatic hepatitis B virus nucleic acids in acute hepatitis infection, we examined serum, liver and multiple extrahepatic tissues obtained at autopsy from two patients with fulminant hepatitis and one patient with resolving hepatitis who died of an unrelated cause. Southern-blot hybridization analysis was used to analyze the physical state of hepatitis B virus-related DNA. Hepatitis B virus-related RNA sequences were examined by slot-blotting total RNA extracted from corresponding tissues. Hepatitis B virus nucleic acids were demonstrated in lymph nodes, spleen, gonads, thyroid gland, kidneys, pancreas and adrenal glands. The most intense signal of hybridization was obtained with DNA extracted from lymph nodes. In general, the levels of hepatitis B virus RNA correlated with the amount of viral DNA. Fast-migrating DNA sequences resembling replicative intermediates and ranging in size from 1 to 3.2 kb were detected in EcoRI digests. Faint high-molecular-weight smears suggesting random integration also were observed. Remarkably, little or no hepatitis B virus nucleic acid was detected in the serum or liver. In control specimens obtained from hepatitis B virus carriers, most hybridizable hepatitis B virus nucleic acid was present in liver, but hepatitis B virus DNA was also detected in extrahepatic tissues. Finally, no specific histological changes were observed in extrahepatic tissues harboring hepatitis B virus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sera from six patients with acute hepatitis B, 112 chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and six healthy individuals with naturally acquired immunity to hepatitis B virus were tested for anti-pol antibody. In acute hepatitis B virus infection, anti-pol antibody was detected in three of six patients. In chronic hepatitis B virus infection, anti-pol antibody was detected in 17 of 29 (59%), in 23 of 33 (70%) of cirrhotic patients and in 18 of 24 (75%) patients with cirrhosis complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma, compared with 4 of 19 (21%) asymptomatic carriers and 2 of 7 (29%) patients with chronic persistent hepatitis. Titers of anti-pol antibody were higher in cirrhotic patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma than in patients with chronic active hepatitis. The presence of anti-pol antibody, however, had no relationship with hepatitis B virus-associated DNA polymerase activities and other viral replicative markers. As for sera from six healthy individuals with naturally acquired immunity to hepatitis B virus, two (33%) were positive for anti-pol antibody. These results indicate that the immune response toward the polymerase gene product is induced during acute and chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In chronic hepatitis B virus infection, anti-pol antibody may serve as a new marker indicative of a long period of hepatitis B virus-induced hepatitis.\r"

Using synthetic peptides, we have examined kinetics and specificity of the anti-body response to preS1 during acute and chronic HBV infection. Antibodies against two continuous B cell epitopes, p (21-32) and p (32-47), which overlap with the virus receptor for hepatocytes, were detected in 17 (28%) and 28 (47%) patients, respectively, of 60 patients who were tested during acute hepatitis B. Serial testing demonstrated these anti-preS1 specificities in more than 50% of patients who became virus free. By contrast, five patients with chronic evolution of hepatitis B and 61 of 66 patients with an established chronic HBV infection were negative, independent of serological profile and liver disease activity. Fifteen (22.7%) patients with chronic hepatitis B were positive for antibody to the C-terminus p (94-117) preS1 sequence that, unlike the acute-phase anti-(21-32) and anti-(32-47) reactivities, did not behave as a virus-precipitating antibody. Acute-phase sera were found to also contain virus-precipitating antibodies directed against conformational preS1 epitopes. These results indicate that the preS1 site, which contains the binding activity for the hepatocyte membrane, elicits an early antibody response during acute hepatitis B. A defect in such antibody repertoire may participate in the chronicity process as a result of continuing reinfection of hepatocytes by circulating virions.\r"

Serum from an individual with chronic liver disease and without hepatitis B virus serological markers but reactive by monoclonal antibody capture/polymerase chain reaction amplification was inoculated into a chimpanzee. After inoculation, an acute hepatitis B virus-like hepatitis developed in the chimpanzee. Analysis of serial liver biopsy samples showed the persistence of hepatitis B virus DNA for more than 17 mo after resolution of acute hepatitis and seroconversion. Applying the technique of restriction enzyme fragment analysis to serial chimpanzee liver biopsy samples and acute-phase sera, along with the serum inoculum, we established that all hepatitis B virus DNA sequences are derived from the same viral agent. We present evidence that the viral DNA persisted as a nonreplicating episomal form in the nucleus of hepatocytes. This study demonstrates that after clinical and serological recovery from an acute hepatitis, there may be persistence of low-level hepatitis B virus-related genome in the liver despite the presence of antibodies to HBsAg. Such persistence of viral genome may be a natural sequela of infection and may serve as a source of viral latency and possible reactivation. Finally, cloning and complete nucleic-acid sequencing of this virus have demonstrated multiple nucleotide and amino acid changes compared with all known hepatitis B virus subtypes. These changes may have contributed in part to a different antigenic composition or immunological reactivity of the host to this hepatitis B virus isolate.\r"

We have identified HLA phenotypes and class II (HLA-DR) gene polymorphisms in 140 white PiZZ subjects, of whom 92 (83 index patients) had liver disease, and 206 first-degree relatives. DR3* was present in 35 of 75 (46.7%) unrelated patients with liver disease compared with 5 of 28 (17.8%) patients without (p less than 0.01) and 23 of 100 controls (p less than 0.001).

Measurement of the diameter of large numbers of collagen fibrils in the space of Disse of the rat liver showed a unimodal distribution of the fibril diameters around an average value of 62.4 nm (S.D. = 12.8 nm), and 91% of the collagen bundles contained less than 30 fibrils. Additional measurements on epoxy resin-embedded material of five biopsy specimens of normal human liver showed a comparable unimodal distribution of the fibril diameters around an average value of 57.2 nm (S.D. = 9.6 nm), and 74% of the bundles contained less than 60 fibrils. The latter observation demonstrates that human liver contains broader interstitial collagen bundles than rat liver. From these results, we conclude that the space of Disse of normal rat and human liver contains a uniform population of striated interstitial collagen fibrils. In the rat liver, these fibrils contain both collagen type I and procollagen type III. Therefore the concept that procollagen type III is predominantly localized in small diameter fibrils or bundles, whereas collagen type I is preferentially localized in thick ones, does not hold.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine administration was tested in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic fibrosis and was able to partially prevent the enlargement of liver and spleen induced by the toxin. This amelioration of the hepatomegaly was accompanied by a 50% reduction of the liver collagen deposition and preservation of content of glycosaminoglycans. A stimulated hepatic collagenase activity is apparently the mechanism for reduction of collagen accumulation. These effects were associated with a striking improvement in liver function. Adenosine treatment did not modify the late hepatotoxic effect of the carbon tetrachloride; however, the stimulatory effect of the nucleoside on energy state appeared to counteract the drastic decreases in adenine nucleotides, ATP, ATP/ADP ratio and energy charge elicited by the hepatotoxin. Moreover, a possible beneficial action of enhanced hepatic oxygenation caused by the vasodilator properties of adenosine cannot be ruled out. Regardless of the mechanism, adenosine seems to change the cellular response to the injury induced by the hepatotoxin.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports suggest that ethanol metabolism leads to reactive oxygen intermediates that may be responsible for the lesions observed in alcoholic hepatitis. This study investigated the production of reactive oxygen intermediates in peripheral blood phagocytes of patients with alcoholic hepatitis and attempts to evaluate its predictive value. Using a luminol-dependent chemiluminescence method, reactive oxygen intermediate production was measured directly within microamounts of whole blood, both in the absence (basal chemiluminescence production) and in the presence of phagocyte-stimulating agents including latex, zymosan, phorbol myristate acetate and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Thirty patients with well-documented and histologically proven alcoholic hepatitis were studied. Pugh's and Child's classification, Orrego's composite clinical and laboratory index and Maddrey's discriminant function were used to assess the prognosis of the liver disease. Patients were followed up monthly for 6 mo. Results were compared with those obtained in 17 patients with nonalcoholic liver disease and in 78 normal control subjects. Basal chemiluminescence production was significantly higher in patients with alcoholic hepatitis than in those with nonalcoholic liver disease and in normal subjects (p less than 0.001). Chemiluminescence responses to latex, zymosan and phorbol myristate acetate were significantly lower in alcoholic hepatitis patients than in normal subjects (p less than 0.001); however, when compared with nonalcoholic liver disease patients, these responses were significantly decreased only in the presence of zymosan (p less than 0.05). Both basal chemiluminescence production (p less than 0.001) and zymosan-induced chemiluminescence responses (p less than 0.02) were closely related to alcoholic hepatitis prognosis indices (i.e., Pugh's and Child's classification, Orrego's composite clinical and laboratory index and Maddrey's discriminant function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-two had alcoholic liver disease, 18 had primary biliary cirrhosis, 16 had primary sclerosing cholangitis, 48 had other forms of cirrhosis (cryptogenic, posthepatic) and 19 had chronic hepatitis or fibrosis without cirrhosis. Bone densities of the lumbar spine and three sites of the proximal femur (neck, Ward's triangle, greater trochanter) were estimated by dual-photon absorptiometry. Bone densities at all sites were significantly correlated to one another (r = 0.4 to 0.9; 95% confidence intervals = 0.24-0.54 to 0.81-0.90; p less than 0.0001 for all). Compared with an age- and gender-matched reference group, patients with liver disease had highly significant decreases in bone densities (greater than 2 standard deviations below control values; p less than 0.0008 at all sites). Decreases were particularly marked (24% to 42%) at Ward's triangle, the site of the femoral neck particularly prone to fracture. The prevalence of decreased bone densities ranged from 10% to 56%, depending on the site studied and the nature of the liver disease. Among 30 laboratory variables studied, there were significant (p less than 0.05) correlations with bone densities at more than one site for urinary creatinine (r = 0.21, 0.25), urinary calcium (r = -0.18, -0.23), serum total alkaline phosphatase (r = -0.18, -0.27) and the liver-1 isozyme of serum alkaline phosphatase (r = -0.19, -0.26).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To quantify the development of encephalopathy, clinical grading and electroencephalographic spectral analysis were used as indicators. In all three experimental models brain ammonia concentrations increased remarkably associated with comparable increases in severity of encephalopathy. Furthermore, in vivo 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of a localized cerebral cortex region showed a decrease in glutamate concentration in each of the aforementioned experimental models. This decreased cerebral cortex glutamate concentration was confirmed by biochemical analysis of cerebral cortex tissue post mortem. Furthermore, an increase in cerebral cortex glutamine and lactate concentration was observed in urease-treated rats and acute liver ischemia rats. As expected, no increase in cerebral cortex glutamine was observed in methionine sulfoximine-treated rats. These data support the hypothesis that ammonia is of key importance in the pathogenesis of acute hepatic encephalopathy. Decreased availability of cerebral cortex glutamate for neurotransmission might be a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. A surprising new finding revealed by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was a decrease of cerebral cortex phosphocholine compounds in all three experimental models. The significance of this finding, however, remains speculative.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported that the liver was the major organ that extracts small, biologically active, circulating forms of cholecystokinin. Although our work indicated extensive degradation of cholecystokinin extracted from plasma during its transit across the hepatocyte, it was unclear whether cholecystokinin might also have a physiological effect on this cell before its intracellular degradation. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that cholecystokinin has a direct biological effect on hepatocytes. Using freshly isolated or cultured hepatocytes, we studied whether cholecystokinin-octapeptide alters protein synthesis, affects amino acid transport or influences cytosolic free calcium concentrations. Using liver slices, we also determined the effect of cholecystokinin-octapeptide on cyclic nucleotide levels. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide, up to a concentration of 1 mumol/L, had no effect on the incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids into total hepatocyte protein; in contrast, comparable molar amounts of insulin stimulated protein synthesis by as much as 37% (ED50 = 1.5 x 10(-10) mol/L). Although insulin and glucagon stimulated the transport into hepatocytes of 14C-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, a nonmetabolizable amino acid analog, cholecystokinin-octapeptide had no affect Cholecystokinin-octapeptide also did not affect either the concentration of calcium in individual hepatocytes, as measured by digitized video microscopy using Fura-2, or the levels of cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP in liver slices. Our results show that cholecystokinin has no effect on protein synthesis, on amino acid transport or on hepatocyte calcium and cyclic nucleotide levels. These and our previous data suggest that the primary outcome of hepatic extraction of cholecystokinin is hormone degradation.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we examined the effect of pharmacological doses of various alpha-adrenergic agents on hepatic portal perfusion, organic anion uptake and bile secretion using the isolated perfused rat liver. Addition of norepinephrine at portal perfusate concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 mumol/L induced a dose-related increase in portal pressure with a twofold increment at the highest concentration. This was accompanied by an inhibition of hepatocellular uptake of taurocholate by 16.8% +/- 1.8% and of sulfobromophthalein (BSP) by 32.9% +/- 3.0% compared with controls. Moreover, a 22.5% +/- 3% decrease in bile flow rate and a 22.8% +/- 4% inhibition of biliary excretion of taurocholate were observed. Addition of other alpha-adrenergic agonist (epinephrine, dopamine and phenylephrine) at similar concentrations produced the same hepatic effects as observed with norepinephrine. During infusion of these alpha-adrenergic agents, trypan blue infusion revealed a patchy perfusion pattern of the liver surface compared with the homogeneously stained organs in controls. The hemodynamic alterations could be confirmed by electron microscopy examination that demonstrated that increased portal pressure produced by norepinephrine was associated with sinusoidal shunting. All hemodynamic, metabolic and biliary changes induced by norepinephrine could be entirely prevented by concomitant infusion of the alpha-antagonist phentolamine, thus indicating that norepinephrine-induced hepatic effects were mediated by alpha-receptors. In contrast, simultaneous addition of papaverine, an unspecific vasodilator, prevented the hemodynamic and the biliary changes of norepinephrine, but failed to modify the metabolic effects of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The biliary bile acid composition was determined for patients with cystic fibrosis and associated liver disease before and after the administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (10 to 15 mg/kg body wt/day). Bile acids were analyzed by fast atom bombardment ionization-mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after individual bile acids were separated according to their mode of conjugation using the lipophilic anion exchanger, diethylaminohydroxypropyl Sephadex LH-20. More than 50 individual bile acids were identified in the bile of cystic fibrosis patients and these acids were predominantly secreted as glycine and taurine conjugates. Small proportions (less than 8% of the total) of unconjugated and sulfate conjugates were present. Of interest was the identification of two side-chain-elongated (C25) bile acids, homocholic and homochenodeoxycholic acids. After ursodeoxycholic acid was administered, duodenal bile became enriched with the conjugated species of ursodeoxycholic acid (accounting for 11.9% to 32.5% of the total biliary bile acids), but to a lesser extent than reported previously for patients with other liver diseases or gallstones who received comparable doses of ursodeoxycholic acid, and this presumably occurs because of bile acid malabsorption that is a feature of cystic fibrosis. The mean glycine/taurine ratio increased from 2.4 before ursodeoxycholic acid administration to 5 after ursodeoxycholic acid administration even though these patients also received taurine. Despite the relatively low enrichment of the bile by ursodeoxycholic acid, biochemical indices of liver function all improved in these patients after ursodeoxycholic acid administration.\r"

  ".W": "Sera from 81 healthy family members (including husbands) of 13 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were tested by Western blotting against the antigen fractions M9 and M2 derived respectively from rat liver and beef heart mitochondria. Fifty-eight (70%) were positive and recognized four major (molecular weights 98 kD, 65 kD, 61 kD, 58 kD) and eight minor determinants (85 kD, 81 kD, 78 kD, 54 kD, 48 kD, 45 kD, 40 kD, 30 kD) labeled alpha-my. Each of the 58 sera recognized at least one of the four major polypeptides. In contrast, only 6% of 80 primary biliary cirrhosis patients had antibodies against one of these epitopes. Sera from 25 patients with different infectious disorders previously shown to react with submitochondrial particles by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay also recognized at least one of the four major determinants. From these findings it was concluded that these antibodies may belong to the family of natural autoantibodies. Since they reacted with submitochondrial fractions, they were defined as \"naturally occurring mitochondrial antibodies\". The high incidence of \"naturally occurring mitochondrial antibodies\" in primary biliary cirrhosis-contact persons may be taken as indirect evidence for a contagious immunogenic agent circulating in the blood of primary biliary cirrhosis-patients. In contrast, the absence of \"naturally occurring mitochondrial antibodies\" in primary biliary cirrhosis-patients themselves implies that an underlying B-cell defect is responsible for this lack of antibody production. Considering the protective role of naturally occurring antibodies in general, this postulated B-cell defect could be a major factor in the etiopathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis.\r"

The findings from serial liver biopsy samples showed characteristic abnormalities of phospholipidosis that have not been previously described for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-related hepatic injury. The most prominent finding on electron microscopic evaluation of the liver was the presence of prominent hepatocyte lysosomal inclusions characterized by concentric arrangements of membranous and lamellated structures. The patient improved after several courses of exchange plasmapheresis, which may have assisted in the removal of toxic drug-lipid complexes. The pathogenesis of this acquired secondary phospholipidosis is unknown. Possible mechanisms include generation of highly lipid-soluble metabolites and inhibition of the lysosomal enzyme phospholipase A1.\r"

The hepatic polyamine level rose only slightly in the D-galactosamine-injected rats treated with glucagon and insulin, and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA increased little; these hormones did not improve the survival rate. When D-galactosamine-injected rats were given putrescine, the putrescine concentration in the liver increased and the survival rate of the rats was significantly higher than that of control rats given only D-galactosamine. Putrescine administration tended to lower the serum level of alanine aminotransferase in rats injected with D-galactosamine, so the polyamine might have a protective effect on hepatocytes. Putrescine significantly increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in the liver; thus it accelerated liver regeneration. Difluoromethylornithine decreased the level of putrescine in the liver, decreasing both [3H]thymidine uptake and the survival rate. In the rats treated with D-galactosamine, in which liver damage was so severe that treatment with glucagon and insulin was ineffective, the intraperitoneal administration of putrescine increased the survival rate in acute liver failure. This probably resulted mainly from activation of liver regeneration and possibly from a protective effect of putrescine on the liver.\r"

  ".W": "Possible interactions between regions of allelic polymorphism in the alpha- and beta-chains of class II MHC molecules were examined by measuring the efficiency of surface expression and the reactivity with mAb of wild-type and recombinant A alpha A beta-chain pairs from the b, d, and k haplotypes. These studies revealed regions of polymorphism within the alpha- and beta-chains that interact with complementary regions in the other chain. Unexpectedly, almost all the variable segments of both the class II MHC alpha- and beta-chains either directly contributed to or were near sites of interchain interactions. The exception was the beta HV3 (hypervariable (HV] segment (residues 61-71), which appeared to neither participate in nor be affected by interchain interactions. This division of the MHC molecule into interacting vs independent regions of allelic structural variation suggests that mutagenesis experiments involving the beta HV3 segment can be analyzed in a straightforward manner, as such mutations appear unlikely to alter the conformation of other molecular segments. Furthermore, functions attributed to the beta HV3 segment either experimentally or by population analysis should have a high probability of transfer by beta HV3 exchange (either experimentally or evolutionarily), because epitopes assigned to this region of the molecule are not affected by sequences outside this segment. This is of special importance because of the apparent involvement of this region in defining a potential site of interaction with antigenic peptides and TCR. In contrast, almost all other variable segments of the MHC molecule appear to have the capacity to contribute to interactions involving at least one other variable segment. This suggests not only that the experimental analysis of the contributions of these regions to various functions requires a consideration of inter- and intrachain interaction, but also that the transfer of function by genetic exchange of these structurally dependent regions is unpredictable. Selection must therefore operate on these interacting HV segments in the context of the complete alpha beta heterodimer. These results support our earlier arguments for cis-co-evolution of alpha- and beta-chain polymorphism and the absence of selection for F1 (hybrid) class II molecules. Finally, asymmetries observed in the contributions of particular pairs of HV segments to the efficient expression of Ia alpha beta heterodimers provide a basis for understanding mechanistically how cis-co-evolution may have occurred.\r"

For this aim, A20-HL B lymphoma cells expressing surface IgM receptors specific for TNP were used as APC. OVA and TNP-OVA were used as nonspecific and specific Ag, respectively. The treatment with emetin greatly impaired the ability of A20-HL cells to present specific Ag, but not nonspecific Ag, to 42-6A cloned T cells specific for OVA. The ability of the emetin-treated A20-HL cells to present nonspecific Ag indicates that the treated cells are able to process nonspecific Ag and to present processed Ag. Ag binding and the internalization by A20-HL cells through surface receptors were not affected by the emetin treatment. A20-HL cells took up specific Ag for stimulation of 42-6A cells in the presence of cycloheximide, a reversible protein synthesis inhibitor. These results suggest that the action of emetin is localized to the intracellular processing of specific Ag, not of nonspecific Ag. Thus, the processing pathway for specific Ag seems to be different from that for nonspecific Ag.\r"

  ".U": "90361865\r", 
  ".W": "Interaction of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-linked differentiation Ag CD73 (ecto-5'-nucleotidase) with the CD73-specific mAb 1E9 generates agonistic signals that strongly synergize with T cell activation induced by CD3 and CD2 mAb. This synergy is observed only when 1E9 is immobilized on plastic and occurs in the absence of accessory cells or exogenous lymphokines. 1E9 induces a rapid (though transient) increase in [Ca2+]i in a minor proportion (20 to 30%) of unfractionated T lymphocytes (presumably CD73+ cells). However, this [Ca2+]i mobilization is not sufficient to fully activate CD73+ T cells, as shown by the requirement of additional signals such as CD3 or CD2 stimulation to initiate T cell proliferation. These signals cannot be substituted by the exogenous lymphokines, rIL-1, rIL-2, or rIL-4, or PMA (when T cells are rigorously depleted of monocytes). These data indicate that CD73 may behave as an accessory molecule regulating interactions between T cells and antigens or APC. A comparison was carried out with mAb 9.3 to the differentiation Ag CD28, another agonistic molecule with activating properties similar to CD73. Despite their lower percentage, the ability of CD73+ T cells to amplify the proliferation induced by CD3 or CD2 mAb was equivalent or even greater than that of CD28+ T cells. Once activated, CD73+ cells may recruit the remaining (CD73-) cells primed by CD3 or CD2 stimulation. Based on these data, we suggest that CD73+ T lymphocytes may be a specialized subset to amplify immune responses originated by the CD3 and CD2 activation pathways. Finally, the functional association between CD73 and integral membrane molecules like CD3 and CD2 suggests that GPI-anchored molecules may play a role in transmembrane signaling mediated by conventional second messenger systems.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we applied mAb and heterologous antisera in double marker combinations to investigate the phenotype and the proliferative activity of immature B lineage cells in XLA. Bone marrow (BM) samples from eight male adult patients with no circulating B lymphocytes were studied. The proportions and the phenotype of the earliest identifiable B cell progenitors, expressing nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), cytoplasmic CD22, and membrane CD19 and CD10 were identical to those observed in normal BM. In XLA these cells represented 1.2% to 22% of BM mononuclear cells; 5% to 42% and 1% to 45% of such cells weakly expressed CD20 and CD37, respectively, and invariably lacked CD13 and CD33. Cytoplasmic mu+ sIg- pre-B cells were seen in low numbers (0.1% to 0.3%) in four samples and were undetectable in the remaining four. Consequently, the ratio TdT+/c mu+ was greater than 100 in five out of eight samples studied in contrast to the less than 10 values seen in normal individuals. The proliferative activity of B lineage progenitor cells was studied by using Ki67 and anti-bromodeoxyuridine mAb. Although the proliferation of TdT+ cells in XLA was comparable with that seen in normal BM samples (24% to 59% of TdT+ were Ki67+ and 11% to 27% incorporated bromodeoxyuridine), this was dramatically reduced in the c mu+ cells (no c mu+, Ki67+ seen in three samples where pre-B cells were observed). Thus, the abnormalities of B cell differentiation in XLA are first seen at the c mu+ pre-B stage and suggest a maturation block in the transition between TdT+, c mu- pre-pre-B cells and c mu+ pre-B cells. The severity of this block may be variable, allowing the generation of a near normal number of pre-B cells in some patients, which nevertheless have a defective proliferative activity. Finally, our study further supports the concept that the effects of the \"XLA gene\" are confined within the B lineage by demonstrating that the proportions of T cells bearing TCR-alpha beta and TCR-gamma delta in XLA are similar to those seen in normal individuals.\r"

In cultures stimulated with SA, B cells produced IgM-RF in the presence of T4 cells, factors generated from mitogen-activated T cells (TF), or IL-2. Similarly, in cultures stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3, T4 cells that had been treated with mitomycin C (T4 mito) induced the production of large amounts of IgM-RF. Limiting dilution analyses revealed that the precursor frequencies of IgM-RF-producing cells induced by SA + TF and by immobilized anti-CD3-activated T4 mito were 0.008 +/- 0.001/100 B cells (n = 7) and 0.043 +/- 0.004/100 B cells (n = 6) (mean +/- SEM), respectively. Of note, the proportion of IgM-secreting cells that produced IgM-RF was much greater in cultures stimulated with SA + TF (30 to 61%) than that noted in cultures containing immobilized anti-CD3-stimulated T4 mito (1.0 to 3.9%). When B cells were co-stimulated with both SA and immobilized anti-CD3-activated T4 mito, the frequency of IgM-RF producing cells increased further to 0.12 to 0.27/100 B cells (4.6 to 21.2% of IgM-producing cells). These results indicate that both SA and immobilized anti-CD3 are potent stimulators of IgM-RF precursors. Moreover, the combination of SA and immobilized anti-CD3 provides a very potent in vitro signal for IgM-RF elaboration, inducing the production of this autoantibody from 1 to 3 in 1000 circulating normal B cells.\r"

  ".U": "90361868\r", 
  ".W": "Blocking of the Ag presenting function of MHC by peptides capable of high affinity binding to this molecule has been proposed as a potential immunotherapeutic intervention in MHC-associated diseases. Recent studies have used this strategy to prevent the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. However, because of the close structural relationship between the inhibitor and encephalitogenic peptides, the results of these previous studies have been difficult to interpret with regard to whether MHC blockade was the mechanism by which the inhibitory peptides functioned. In our study, we have determined the capacity of unrelated peptides capable of binding with high affinity to IAs in inhibiting the induction of EAE in SJL/J mice after immunization with the autoantigenic peptide PLP 139-151. Prevention of the disease was accomplished by two methods: 1) when inhibitor was administered together with the encephalitogenic peptide at the time of immunization, as in previous studies, and 2) when inhibitor was administered at a separate site from the autoantigen 1 day before the immunization with that Ag. Inhibition was due to binding of the inhibitor to IAs, as evidenced by the fact that a control peptide incapable of binding to this MHC had no effect on the course of the disease. The finding that inhibitor could also be efficacious when administered at a separate site has implications for potential use of such a strategy to reverse ongoing autoimmune diseases. The inhibitor had to be present during the time of Ag stimulation, and had no long term inhibitory effects, in that a secondary immune response to the encephalitogenic peptide was not inhibited in animals given the inhibitory peptide before the induction of a primary response. This is compatible with the conclusion that MHC blockade was, in fact, the mechanism of the inhibition, rather than as a result of any long term suppressive effects on immunoreactive T cells. Finally, not only did administration of the inhibitory peptide lead to a prevention of the induction of EAE, but it could also be shown to decrease the T cell proliferative response in vitro to the autoantigen.\r"

Granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes of patients with LAD show profoundly defective in vivo and in vitro adherence-dependent immune functions. We investigated the expression of FcR for IgG on polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and monocytes from patients with LAD, and their luminol- and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence production in response to SRBC sensitized with murine (m) IgG2a and IgG2b. Unstimulated patient PMN showed an enhanced chemiluminescence in response to mIgG2a-SRBC and an increased phagocytosis of mIgG2a-SRBC. The up-regulated functions were inhibited by monomeric human IgG in a dose-dependent manner, which was attributed to an increase in expression of FcRI on patient PMN, as shown by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibody, 32.2, specific for human FcRI. In contrast, neither the expression of FcR on the monocytes of LAD patients nor their FcR-mediated functions were different from those of controls.\r"

Surprisingly, 8 of 156 patients sera could additionally elicit lysis of HIV-2-infected cells, and cold target competition assays demonstrated that the cross-reactivity was apparently mediated via recognition of common epitope(s) expressed on the surface of cells infected with either group of HIV. The ADCC mechanism was shown to be mediated by a CD16+ lymphocyte.

We investigated the expression of receptors for TNF-alpha, a monocyte-derived cytokine, on the surface of hairy cells from seven HCL patients before and after treating them with IFN-alpha. Iodinated TNF-alpha binding experiments showed the presence of high affinity TNF-alpha receptors in six patients, but no specific binding was detected in the seventh. Scatchard's analysis revealed the presence of a single class of receptors, with 130 to 1200 sites/cell (mean 420) and Kd values of 0.37 to 0.89 nM. The TNF-alpha-R complex was identified by cross-linking as a single band of 94 kDa. Treatment of the patients with 3 x 10(6) U of IFN-alpha 2a markedly increased the number of TNF-alpha-R at 24 or 48 h, without changing the Kd. In the patient who lacked receptor expression on his tumor cells, high affinity TNF-alpha-R were detected at 48 h after IFN injection. These results suggest that in hairy cells, IFN-alpha can interact in vivo with TNF-alpha, through the modulation of TNF-R.\r"

In order to address this limitation, we have modified the mRNA phenotyping system to allow for the quantitation of lymphokine mRNA after antigenic stimulation in vivo. We report here the production of both IL-2 and IL-4 mRNA in vivo after primary sensitization with picryl chloride. However, the time course of IL-2 and IL-4 mRNA production is discordant. The majority of IL-2 mRNA expression occurs from 1 to 3 days after antigenic exposure, whereas IL-4 mRNA expression occurs mainly from day 3 through day 5. Thus, the production in vivo of these two lymphokine mRNA after sensitization with picryl chloride appears to occur as a \"cascade.\" These results 1) demonstrate that IL-4 mRNA is induced during a primary immune response in vivo and 2) raise the possibility that the generation of an immune response in vivo may involve a specific sequential production of certain lymphokines.\r"

  ".W": "Different cells and cell lines of murine origin were tested for their capacity to bind the C subcomponent C1q by using biotinylated human C1q and streptavidin-FITC. Cytofluorometric analysis of splenocytes and thymocytes shows that the majority of C1q-reactive cells reside in the population of B cells and macrophages. There is a significant difference in the C1q-binding capacity of in vitro activated cells; although more than half of the B cell blasts bind the C subcomponent, T cell blasts are virtually negative. It is shown that pre-B lymphomas and cell lines of myeloid origin bind C1q strongly (90 to 98%), whereas in the case of mature B cell lymphomas, plasmocytomas, and the tested T cell lines, the percentage of C1q binding cells varies from 0 to 56. C1q affinity chromatography of the detergent extracts from P388D1 and WEHI-3 cells followed by SDS-PAGE of the eluted proteins under reducing conditions reveals a band at approximately 80 kDa. Analysis of splenocytes shows two additional minor C1q-binding molecules with apparent molecular masses of 50 and 45 kDa, whereas in the case of B cell blasts three bands of similar density are seen at approximately 95, 50 and 45 kDa. C1q-receptors of murine cells are shown to be antigenically related to their human counterpart, because a polyclonal antibody (266A) raised against the human C1q receptor reacts with them.\r"

  ".W": "The TCR for Ag, on the majority of human T cells, is a disulfide-linked heterodimer composed of TCR-alpha and -beta chains noncovalently associated with the monomorphic CD3 complex composed of the CD3-gamma, -delta, -epsilon, and -zeta chains. The interactions involved in the assembly of the various components of this multimeric protein complex are not fully understood. In this report, a variant of the human leukemic T cell line Jurkat that synthesized all of the known components of the TCR/CD3 complex but fails to express the TCR/CD3 complex at the cell surface is further characterized. This variant, J79, has a mutated TCR-alpha chain that does not affect the assembly of the pentameric form (TCR-alpha beta-CD3-gamma delta epsilon) of the TCR/CD3 complex but inhibits the assembly of the CD3-zeta homodimer with the rest of the complex (TCR-alpha beta-CD3-gamma delta epsilon----TCR-alpha beta-CD3-gamma delta epsilon zeta 2). Transfecting a wild-type TCR-alpha gene into J79 reconstituted expression of a complete functionally competent TCR/CD3 complex at the cell surface. The results indicate that the TCR-alpha chain plays a crucial role in the assembly of the CD3-zeta homodimer with the pentameric form of the TCR/CD3 complex.\r"

  ".U": "90361881\r", 
  ".W": "Analysis of the coding sequences of the murine Cr2 gene indicated that it contains two distinct regions of homology to the murine Crry, and human CR1 and CR2 genes. The last 15 short consensus repeats (SCR) of Cr2 are very similar to the 15 reported SCR of human CR2. These 15 SCR of Cr2, plus the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, make up a protein very similar in organization and sequence to the human CR2 gene product. Another Cr2 transcript contains the sequences encoding the previously described 15 SCR plus those encoding another six amino terminal SCR. These amino terminal SCR are very similar to those of Crry and the first six SCR seen within the CR1 long homologous repeats. Amino acid sequence similarity analysis, however, indicated that the sequences encoding the six amino terminal SCR of Cr2 evolved from a separate lineage of SCR than Crry and CR1, suggesting that the human counterparts to these additional Cr2 SCR had not been identified. Using the cDNA sequences specific for the amino terminal SCR of murine Cr2, the human counterparts were isolated and localized within the human CR2 gene between those nucleotides encoding the signal sequence and those encoding the first SCR of the mature human CR2 protein. Unlike the murine Cr2 gene products, these Crry/CR1-like sequences of the CR2 gene are not maintained in mature CR2 mRNA, and thus represent pseudoexons. DNA sequence analysis of the pseudoexon homologous to that encoding the first SCR of the murine Cr2 gene indicated that a stop codon has been introduced within the human coding sequence but that the 5' and 3' splice recognition sequences appear to be functional. Although the stop codon would block the translation of a transcript with this exon, it would not inhibit the incorporation of the exon within the mature CR2 transcript. Therefore, another mutation must have been introduced within the human CR2 gene such that both this exon and the other CR1/Crry-like exons are removed from mature CR2 transcripts.\r"

  ".U": "90361882\r", 
  ".W": "The H-2Kf allele and the spontaneous mutant Kfm1 have been cloned using locus-specific sequences. The mutation consists of a cluster of four nucleotide changes, resulting in amino acid substitutions at positions 95 (Leu----Ile) and 97 (Val----Arg). This finding has structural, genetic, and technical implications. The amino acid substitutions are located on the beta-strands of the antigen recognition site. Their influence on the allogeneic properties of the Kf glycoprotein is consistent with the hypothesis that alloreactivity results from alterations in the spectrum of peptides presented to T cells. These substitutions would not, however, be predicted to be directly accessible for binding to antibodies. Nonetheless, the fm1 mutant binds anti Kf alloantisera and mAb much less strongly than the parent molecule, suggesting some indirect effect of these residues on serologic phenotype. The mutant is also interesting genetically because the sequence of the mutated region is identical to the sequence of the Df gene. This implies that there is a gene conversion-like mutational mechanism operating in the H-2f haplotype. Finally, the strategy used to obtain these K-locus cDNA should prove generally useful for isolating other MHC alleles.\r"

Two subpopulations of IgG, M1-I and M1-II, were obtained from serum of MRL-lpr/lpr mice by column chromatography on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. Although M1-I did not bind to the column, its elution was retarded, whereas M1-II was bound and was eluted in acidic buffer. IgG (Mn) from MRL(-)+/+ mice showed the same chromatographic behavior as M1-II. The structures of oligosaccharide chains liberated quantitatively by hydrazinolysis from IgG samples Mn, M1-I, M1-II, and a pooled mixture (M1) of M1-I and M1-II were determined by sequential exoglycosidase digestion, lectin (RCA120) affinity HPLC, and by methylation analysis. Their oligosaccharide structures were the same and shown to be biantennary complex-type chains +/- Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----2Man alpha 1----6(+/- Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----2Man alpha 1----3)Man beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4(+/- Fuc alpha 1----6)GlcNAc. The proportion of each oligosaccharide in Mn and M1-II was the same but differed from that in M1-I where the degree of the galactosylation was significantly decreased which caused the change in the oligosaccharide pattern of total serum IgG (M1) of autoimmune MRL-lpr/lpr mice. This phenomenon, which is also found in total serum IgG of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, suggests that alteration of oligosaccharides in IgG may be a common feature in animals which develop arthritis with the production of rheumatoid factor regardless of species.\r"

  ".W": "We have found that if core regions crucial for class II binding are incorporated in multiple copies in the same peptide molecule (\"reiterative motifs\"), marked enhancement of the binding capacity occurs. Isotype specificity (IAd vs IEd binding capacities) is retained in all three antigenic determinants so far analyzed (lambda rep 12-26, OVA 323-339, and hen egg lysozyme 105-120). The mechanism involved in such an effect is not clear, but experiments involving introduction of a peptide spacer between two repeated core regions do not support the notion that the effect is mediated by cross-linking of more than one MHC molecule, favoring the possibility that conformational effects or distinct subsites of interaction on the MHC molecule may be involved. Based on reiterative structures, a peptide molecule composed of only two different amino acids (Ala and His) has been produced that still retains a very high binding affinity. An 125I-radiolabeled form of this peptide has been used to demonstrate that the high binding detected is mediated by the same binding site involved in the interaction of IAd and OVA 323-339. Inhibition of Ag presentation studies further supports the immunologic relevance of the phenomena observed. Finally, we observed naturally occurring clustered binding sites in proximity of immunodominant protein regions, raising the possibility that the phenomenon might have a physiologic counterpart.\r"

We present a mathematical framework for designing and analyzing experiments aimed at uncovering the inhibition mechanism(s). From our model, we calculate concentrations of receptors and ligands in the different cell surface states, at equilibrium or as a function of time. IgG can cross-link surface receptors in three ways, i.e., by bridging two sIg molecules without Fc binding, by bridging two sIg while binding as well to an Fc gamma R, and by binding to an Fc gamma R and only one sIg. We show how the concentrations or fractions of these distinct cross-linked states depend on experimentally manipulable variables, including the concentrations of intact IgG, bivalent and monovalent IgG fragments, and agents that block Fc binding. Then, using simple signal/response relationships, reflecting active and passive mechanisms of Fc-mediated inhibition, we simulate the results of a variety of experiments. In cases where published experimental results are available, we find that the qualitative predictions of our general model are consistent with the data and that comparisons of simulations with available data provide some quantitative information about the parameters governing the cell surface signaling events. In particular, comparison of model predictions with published experiments on the kinetics of IgG-induced inositol trisphosphate production indicate that sIg cross-links form more rapidly than sIg-Fc gamma R \"co-cross-links.\" Further, IgG-sIg bonds stabilize Fc attachments, i.e., the dissociation of IgG from Fc gamma R is slowed significantly when the IgG is also cross-linked to sIg. Predictions of the model suggest other experiments and ways of presenting the data that will help to identify relationships between the molecular signaling events occurring on the cell surface and the various cellular responses.\r"

  ".W": "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) (5HT) a neurotransmitter and vasoactive amine, is a major storage product of platelets that are released at sites of inflammation. Several different subtypes of serotonin receptors have been defined. 5HT receptors have been divided into three major families based on molecular, biochemical, and pharmacologic properties. Binding of serotonin to the 5HT1 family results in inhibition of adenylate cyclase whereas binding to the 5HT2 family results in stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. 5HT has been shown to have effects on lymphoid cells. The question of whether human T lymphocytes express receptors for 5HT and transduce signals through 5HT receptors has not been adequately addressed. As a model system, Jurkat cells (a transformed human T lymphocyte line) were examined to determine if they expressed 5HT receptors and whether 5HT stimulated an increase in inositol phosphates or affected adenylate cyclase activity. The results show that Jurkat cells bind 5HT with an average dissociation constant of 90 nM and that 5HT stimulates an increase in inositol phosphate and intracellular Ca2+ levels. These results link the 5HT receptor on Jurkat cells to the 5HT2 family; however, studies with 5HT receptor agonists and antagonists failed to clearly classify the 5HT receptor on Jurkat cells as a known member of the 5HT2 family.\r"

Peritoneal cell influx was evaluated after i.p. injection of preformed immune complexes. The first significant elevation in the PMN count over PBS-treated controls in +/+ mice was observed 2 h after stimulation. During the period of maximum leukocyte concentrations (6 to 10 h), the increase in total cell count was 5-fold and in PMN 25-fold. In W/Wv mice the PMN influx started 2 h later than in the +/+ mice, and the maximum response (8 to 10 h) was only 50% of that in controls. Reconstitution of mast cells in W/Wv mice for 2 wk or more restored the PMN response to immune complexes. Mast cell release due to AG-antibody complexes was evaluated by measuring fluorescence intensity after berberine sulfate staining for heparin in mast cells from unstimulated as well as stimulated +/+ mice. There was a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity as early as 15 min after stimulation. By 30 min the fluorescence intensity had declined by 65%. This indicates extensive mast cell release that started before PMN mobilization. These experiments demonstrate that mast cells make a significant contribution to immune complex-induced inflammation.\r"

  ".U": "90361899\r", 
  ".W": "We have compared the transmembrane signals generated in human basophils by two distinct stimuli, anti-IgE antibody and FMLP (f-met peptide). Although both stimuli resulted in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and an increase in intracellular free calcium, there were substantial differences between the two which suggested that distinct signal transduction mechanisms were operating. We have confirmed an earlier observation that the cross-linking of IgE led to an increase in membrane PKC activity with no apparent concomitant loss of cytosolic PKC and established that in contrast, the univalent stimulus, f-met peptide, resulted in the canonical translocation of cytosolic PKC to the membrane. Furthermore, unlike anti-IgE-stimulated basophils, there was no clear relationship between the increase in PKC activity and the subsequent release of histamine. Two PKC inhibitors, staurosporine (0.1 to 1 nM) and sphingosine (25 to 50 microM), inhibited anti-IgE induced release, yet, potentiated the release of mediators after a challenge with 1 microM f-met peptide. Both stimuli led to an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ levels that correlated well with the release of histamine, however, the anti-IgE-induced responses were typically only 50% of those required to give equivalent histamine release when f-met peptide initiated release. Pharmacologic evidence suggested that the up-regulation of PKC was required for a full IgE-mediated Ca2+ response and that PKC contributed to the elevated Ca2+ levels that persist for up to 15 min after the addition of anti-IgE. In contrast, the PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, did not affect the initial increase in Ca2+ after the addition of f-met peptide but reduced the rate at which Ca2+ was removed from the cytosol. Experiments with the phorbol ester, PMA, suggested that substantial degranulation can occur in the absence of any increase in intracellular Ca2+. The addition of 10 ng/ml PMA 10 min before the addition of f-met peptide did not affect the magnitude of the initial Ca2+ transient but increased the rate at which Ca2+ levels returned to a stable baseline. Similar pretreatment with PMA almost completely abolished the anti-IgE antibody-induced Ca2+ response. These experiments, together with other previous data, suggest that the activation of PKC is a prodegranulatory component of the IgE-mediated signal transduction pathway, yet serves principally to modulate the Ca2+ signal when f-met peptide initiates release.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils and eicosanoid chemoattractants are centrally involved with ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. The CD 18 complex of adhesive glycoproteins, readily up-regulated by chemoattractants in vitro, is required for polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adherence to endothelium. This study tests whether CD 18 is up-regulated by ischemia in vivo and its role in mediating PMN diapedesis. Anesthetized rabbits underwent 3 h of bilateral hindlimb tourniquet ischemia (n = 16). Ten min after tourniquet release, levels of plasma leukotriene (LT)B4 increased to 390 +/- 62 pg/ml (mean +/- SE), higher than 134 +/- 26 pg/ml in control rabbits (n = 13, p less than 0.01). Aliquots of plasma were added to whole blood from normal rabbits (n = 6) for flow cytometric analysis of neutrophils with the CD 18 mAb R 15.7. Addition of I/R plasma failed to demonstrate an increase in surface expression of CD 18. Similarly, no CD 18 up-regulation was observed in vivo upon reperfusion in ischemic animals pretreated with mAb R 15.7 (n = 3). However, I/R plasma when introduced into plastic chambers taped atop dermabrasion sites in normal rabbits (n = 12) resulted in diapedesis, measured by the accumulation after 3 h of 1130 +/- 125 PMN/mm3 in the chambers relative to 120 +/- 31 PMN/mm3 with control plasma (p less than 0.01). Diapedesis in response to I/R plasma was abolished by pretreatment with mAb R 15.7 (less than 5 PMN/mm3, n = 6), was reduced by U 75,302, an LTB4 receptor antagonist (253 +/- 101 PMN/mm3, n = 6) (both p less than 0.01) and was not protein synthesis dependent. These results demonstrate that PMN diapedesis in response to I/R plasma is exclusively dependent upon the CD 18 glycoprotein complex by an LTB4-dependent mechanism, despite the fact that CD 18 is not up-regulated on circulating PMN in ischemia. These data indirectly indicate the functional importance of conformational changes of CD 18 in determining PMN adhesion.\r"

Inbred and congenic mice of two different MHC haplotypes, H-2k and H-2d, were examined. Serologic analysis showed that the humoral responses to the major surface 29-kDa glycoprotein of adult parasites and a 40-kDa Ag from the surface of the microfilarial stage were restricted to mice with H-2k alleles (B10.BR, CBA/Ca, and CBA/N), whereas mice of the H-2d haplotype (B10.D2/n and BALB/c) were nonresponsive to these Ag. Conversely, internal adult Ag of molecular mass of 24 and 66 kDa were recognized only by animals with the H-2d haplotype. Apart from MHC-restricted recognition, the level of responses to phosphorylcholine and to a 15-kDa adult surface molecule were found to be influenced by non-MHC genes. A sharp restriction was also observed to an adult surface Ag complex of 17 to 200 kDa, which was recognized only by BALB/c mice. Thus, multiple examples of both H-2 and background genetic effects on the immune response to distinct filarial Ag can be found.\r"

  ".W": "Influenza A virus infections are commonly associated with symptoms that suggest involvement of TNF-alpha. In this study, we exposed human monocytes, rat alveolar macrophages, and murine PU5-1.8 macrophages to influenza A virus, strain Puerto Rico 8. We observed a productive infection that was accompanied by TNF-alpha mRNA accumulation, TNF-alpha release and subsequent cell death. TNF-alpha production was dependent on exposure to live virus, in contrast to IFN release that was also induced by UV-inactivated virus. Most strikingly, low amounts of LPS (1 to 10 ng/ml) from Escherichia coli or Haemophilus influenzae were capable of strongly potentiating TNF-alpha production from virus-infected macrophages. The potentiating effect of LPS was neither due to increased survival of macrophages nor to altered virus multiplication, enhanced TNF-alpha gene expression, discharge of intracellular TNF-alpha stores, or shifts in the kinetics of TNF-alpha release. Thus, low amounts of LPS, which could easily be present in vivo, may serve as a potent trigger signal for TNF-alpha production from macrophages that have been primed by influenza A virus infection. These data suggest that the frequently observed serious complications of combined influenza A virus and bacterial infections may be partially due to a high TNF-alpha production.\r"

H. sylvilagus neutralizing antibodies appeared as early as 7 days after infection, peaked 2 to 4 wk postinfection and decreased to low levels by 8 to 10 wk postinfection. Complement-dependent antibodies mediating the protection of in vitro infection of monocytes and Con A-stimulated lymphoblasts with H. sylvilagus were observed as were complement-dependent cytotoxic antibodies against H. sylvilagus-infected cells. No cytolytic activity was present in sera taken either before or 3 days after infection; cytolysis was first observed 7 days after infection. The development of cytolytic antibodies appeared to be biphasic during an infection course of 12 to 16 wk. In vivo induction of a primary cytotoxic lymphocyte response to H. sylvilagus was also investigated. Splenic lymphocytes from infected animals lysed H. sylvilagus-infected skin fibroblasts; however, similar activity was not observed when PBMC or mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes were used as effector cells. H. sylvilagus-infected autologous skin fibroblasts were preferentially lysed as compared to heterologous skin fibroblasts. This virus-specific cytotoxic activity appeared 5 days postinfection and peaked 7 days postinfection. By 28 days postinfection, only low levels of cytotoxic activity were detected in spleen cells. Herpesvirus sylvilagus infection of cottontail rabbits provides an animal model for the study of lymphoproliferative disorders induced by herpesviruses.\r"

  ".U": "90361905\r", 
  ".W": "Two cDNA clones coding for allelic miniature swine MHC class II Ag DQB chains have been isolated, characterized, and shown to be expressed after transfection into mouse fibroblasts. The two alleles differ at the nucleotide level by an overwhelming proportion of replacement substitutions, suggesting the influence of selection for polymorphism. Most of the resulting predicted amino acid replacements are in regions commonly polymorphic in mouse Ab and human DQB sequences, corresponding to the predicted Ag recognition site. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons to homologous mouse and human sequences show more similarity between swine and man than between either swine and mouse or man and mouse. This tendency is most pronounced when comparing the 3' untranslated regions. However, an examination of unique cross-species sharing of amino acid residues suggests a closer relationship between both man and miniature swine and man and mouse than between miniature swine and mouse. The simplest explanation we can envision for these findings is that the mouse DQB gene homologue (Ab) has been subject to a higher substitution rate than either swine or human DQB genes. An additional cytoplasmic exon expressed in mouse Ab gene products and in putative human DQB2 gene products is lacking in both swine and human DQB cDNA clones. Its absence suggests either that the expression of this exon in mouse Ab genes was activated after mammalian speciation or that the expression of this exon was independently inactivated in swine DQB and human DQB1 genes. Alternatively, the mouse Ab gene may be derived from the same primordial gene as human DQB2, whereas the pig DQB gene may be derived from the same primordial gene as the human DQB1 gene.\r"

  ".W": "B cells express MHC class II Ag in a constitutive fashion, whereas macrophages can do so only after induction by a variety of exogenous stimuli. In this study we describe interspecies somatic cell hybrids between the human B cell Raji and the murine macrophage cell P388 D1. This murine cell line does not express detectable levels of class II mRNA. Phenotypic, molecular, and karyotype analysis of a series of hybrids showed that murine macrophage class II genes can be expressed in a constitutive fashion under the control of the human B cell genome. This event is the consequence of de novo accumulation of class II specific mRNA and thus probably reflects activation of transcription. In certain cases the amount of murine class II Ag expressed on the surface of the hybrid cell was significantly higher than the one observed in the parental macrophage cells after induction with IFN-gamma and was not further modified by treatment with the murine lymphokine. Reversion from a murine class II-positive to class II-negative cell surface phenotype in the hybrids correlated with reduced expression of human markers and more important with segregation of human chromosomes. Interestingly, in this case certain hybrids still expressed detectable levels of murine class II mRNA and increased levels of murine invariant chain mRNA when compared with parental P388 D1 murine macrophage cells. These results indicate that constitutive class II gene expression behaves as a dominant trait in B cell x macrophage somatic cell hybrids. Possible mechanisms responsible of the different control of class II gene expression during cell type differentiation are discussed.\r"

A retrospective chart review over a 10-year period was conducted to better characterize these symptoms in a rural family practice providing health care to 508 adult patients. Asthenic complaints were recorded at least once in the medical charts of 164 patients (32%) with a preponderance of female patients. Peak prevalence occurred in the third decade of age and during the summer months. Associated symptoms, mainly pain and dizziness, were reported in 75% of the cases. A cause or diagnosis was not identified by the practicing physician in nearly 50% of the encounters; nevertheless, most episodes resolved spontaneously. Patients could be subclassified into three categories according to the recurrence pattern of their asthenic symptoms during the study period. The largest category (64%) included patients who had a single or two episodes and was thus termed \"episodic asthenia.\" Forty-five patients (27%) with recurrent episodes (mean 4.4, range 3 to 10) were classified as having \"recurrent episodic asthenia.\" A third small group (14 patients, 9%) with persistent complaints over the years but no evidence of the chronic fatigue syndrome were classified as having \"chronic persistent asthenia.\" The proposed classification may help future research of asthenic symptoms in the family practice setting.\r"

A 50% probability sample of all family and general physicians and of all graduates of Pennsylvania family practice residency programs was surveyed by mail. Ten percent of Pennsylvania family physicians and general practitioners reported currently practicing obstetrics, 44% of whom said they planned to stop within 3 years. Telephone survey information from nonresponders suggests that even fewer (5%) of the state's family physicians may actually be practicing obstetrics. Family practice residency training, postresidency obstetric training, and small community size were the best predictors of current obstetric practice. Family physicians in the smallest communities, however, were also those most likely to be planning to stop, and graduates of residency programs were increasingly choosing not to practice obstetrics. Cost of liability insurance and fear of lawsuits were primary reasons cited for stopping obstetrics. Family physicians have been major providers of obstetric care in the nation's rural areas. Now, increasingly firm evidence that fewer family physicians are practicing obstetrics signals increasing shortages in obstetric care for women in rural communities. Changes in the practice climate and obstetric training programs for family physicians seem essential to help reverse these trends.\r"

Of particular importance is Public Law 99-457, the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986, which recognizes the importance of the family unit in any intervention methodology that may be provided. This legislation also notes that the active involvement of the family's physician is desirable when designing services appropriate for children with developmental disabilities and their families. Providing support and optimizing positive family interactions are crucial to these children. Recommendations to enable the family physician to address more effectively the unique needs of this patient population include (1) an informal screening protocol, and (2) communication skills that include talking with both parents at the same time, using accurate, nonstigmatizing language when presenting a diagnosis, showing acceptance of and optimism regarding the child, encouraging parents to explain their child's problems to others, helping parents to learn about their children's unique needs, and helping parents to understand how their attitudes affect their child.\r"

  ".W": "Family practice as a specialty, now just over 20 years of age, arose in response to increasing public pressure and societal needs, not primarily from a breakthrough in new clinical knowledge or technology advances. Its academic discipline of family medicine is necessarily derived more from its clinical principles and functions in practice than from a unique body of knowledge and skills. Nevertheless, the mixture of knowledge, skills, and attitudes are collectively unique as applied by the family physician, and are teachable, learnable, and subject to critical inquiry and research. This paper presents an overview of the progress, present challenges, and future opportunities of family medicine as an academic discipline. A comparative analysis of the literature in the three primary care specialties reveals more commonalities than differences. Family practice has much to contribute to needed reforms in medical education and the health care system. The field is ideally positioned to be an active part of future resolutions to today's problems in both arenas.\r"

With two mailings, responses were received from 85.3% of the residencies, with 80 pharmacists completing surveys. While the involvement of pharmacists in family practice residencies was similar to that reported in a survey 9 years ago, academic appointments and funding, in whole or in part by a college of medicine, had increased. This increased involvement may represent an acknowledgment by medical educators in family practice of the value of pharmacists participating in residency programs.\r"

The chemicals tested and their approximate partition ratios were the following: acetaldehyde (190:1), acetone (341:1), acetonitrile (578:1), isoprene (1:1), isopropanol (1671:1), methanol (3229:1), methylene chloride (11:1), methyl ethyl ketone (229:1), toluene (5.5:1), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (14:1), trichloroethylene (20:1), and a 50:50 mixture of 1,1,1-trichloroethane and trichloroethylene (14:1). Of the eleven chemicals and one mixture studied during this experiment, only three, isopropanol, toluene, and methyl ethyl ketone, could reasonably interfere with the test, and then only under unusual circumstances--those circumstances being a slight additive effect to a breath ethanol concentration near the level required for prosecution. Any substantial additive effect from these three substances would illuminate the interference light which invalidates the test. The mean illumination point of the interference light was 0.0286 g/210 L for methyl ethyl ketone, 0.0294 for toluene, and between 0.0116 and 0.0292 for the apparent alcohol concentration for isopropanol, depending on the amount of isopropanol metabolized to acetone. Even with these unusual circumstances considered, the Intoxilyzer 4011AS-A must be viewed as an effective way of determining the ethanol concentration in human breath for evidential purposes.\r"

The pattern is created by DNA probes that bind to variable-length repeated sequences of human genomic DNA digested with restriction endonucleases. To improve DNA fingerprints obtained with biotin-labeled M13mp8 replicative form (RF) bacteriophage as the gene probe, the conditions for hybridization and the subsequent washing steps of the filter were refined. Experiments were conducted varying the electrophoresis time, blotting membranes, hybridization solution, and posthybridization washes. The simplicity, sensitivity, and reliability of this nonistopic technique make possible its application for identification of individuals within a species, for parentage testing, and for monitoring bone marrow transplantation.\r"

This study measured the mesiodistal and faciolingual crown diameters of all deciduous teeth, as well as those of the permanent first molars, of 162 children from the Burlington Orthodontic Growth Study, conducted earlier in Burlington, Ontario, Canada. All 40 deciduous tooth diameters (20 mesiolingual and 20 faciolingual) were significantly different between the sexes, as were the permanent tooth diameters. Using three to five measurements of deciduous teeth, discriminant analyses of several samplings of these children produced discriminant functions in which 76 to 90% of the holdout samples were correctly classified by sex. Combinations of deciduous and permanent measurements were used to classify 83 to 85% of the holdout samples correctly. When compared with published data on other sample populations, the Burlington group is the most dimorphic for deciduous teeth and is within the range of permanent tooth dimorphisms of other populations. The level of classification accuracy, when using discriminant analysis of the deciduous teeth, can approach the accuracy levels of analysis using the permanent teeth.\r"

  ".W": "The sexing of subadult remains has been an ongoing problem in physical anthropology for many years. This is due in part to the scarcity of subadult collections of known age and sex which are large enough to be used to develop and test analytical methods. Several methods have been devised but few have produced reliable results. In 1980, Weaver presented a method for sexing subadult ilia using a nonmetric trait (the raised versus nonraised auricular surface), which has an accuracy of 75% in fetal females and 92% in fetal males. His method has not been tested for reliability on a different subadult sample. An indirect test of Weaver's method was made on a sample of subadult South Dakota Arikara Indian ilia by comparing the ratio of raised to nonraised auricular surfaces with an expected 1:1 sex distribution. Bimodal sex distributions in the Arikara formed unrealistic sex ratios, following an age-related shift from a 6:1 raised/nonraised ratio in newborns to a 1:4 ratio in young adolescence. Significant age correlations were found both in the present study and in Weaver's published results. The age-to-sex correlations indicated no confounding in the present study. The results of this test suggest that auricular surface morphology is not sex specific in subadult ilia, but may be related to aspects of shape and morphology in pelvic growth.\r"

The authors studied 505 victims of fatal heroin overdose and compared subjects who had concentrations of blood ethanol greater than 1000 mg/L (n = 306) with those who had concentrations less than, or equal to 1000 mg/L (n = 199). We found significant negative correlations between concentrations of ethanol and morphine (a heroin metabolite) in blood (R2 = 0.11, P = 0.0001 for log10-transformed variables) as well as between concentrations of blood ethanol and bile morphine (R2 = 0.16, P = 0.0001 for log10 bile morphine versus blood morphine). Toxicologic evidence of infrequent heroin use was more common in decedents with blood ethanol concentrations greater than 1000 mg/L than in those with lower concentrations. Our data suggest that ethanol enhances the acute toxicity of heroin, and that ethanol use indirectly influences fatal overdose through its association with infrequent (nonaddictive) heroin use and thus with reduced tolerance to the acute toxic effects of heroin.\r"

Data are obtained from hospital records, police reports, labor reports, death certificates, or other sources. Medical examiner/coroner records are, however, not often used in epidemiologic studies. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Division of Safety Research has begun using these records in its research program on work-related trauma. Because medical examiners and coroners have the legal authority and responsibility to investigate all externally caused deaths, these records can be used in surveillance of these deaths. Another use of these records is to validate cases identified by other case ascertainment methods, such as death certificates. Using medical examiner/coroner records also allows rapid identification of work-related deaths without waiting several years for mortality data from state offices of vital statistics. Finally, the records are an invaluable data source since they contain detailed information on the nature of the injury, external cause of death, and results of toxicologic testing, which is often not available from other sources. This paper illustrates some of the ways that medical examiner/coroner records are a valuable source of information for epidemiologic studies and makes recommendations to improve their usefulness.\r"

In addition, extracted human teeth were incinerated in the laboratory and impregnated with commercially available preparations of either cyanoacrylate cement, clear acrylic spray paint, hair spray, spray furniture varnish, clear fingernail polish, quick-setting epoxy cement, Duco household cement, polyvinyl acetate polymer in acetone, or self-curing clear dental acrylic resin.

As expected the incidence of abnormality of all functions increased from Group I to III, but within a group there was no clear pattern of differential involvement of different fibre types. The study has identified those tests that are suitable for detecting early neuropathy (warming and vibration perception thresholds and sensory nerve action potentials) and those which are likely to be useful in assessing deterioration or improvement (particularly vibration perception threshold), but since the different tests cannot be equally matched for sensitivity it is not possible to interpret the results in terms of the degree of pathological involvement of different fibre groups.\r"

In four, the lack of dopamine was secondary to a reduction in concentration of levodopa and these were treated with levodopa together with a peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor. In the other two, levodopa in the central nervous system naturally accumulated due to a congenital deficiency of aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase and these were treated with pyridoxine (which in this condition lowers central levodopa concentrations). Raising levodopa concentrations in the central nervous system caused a fall in CSF S-adenosyl-methionine concentration and a rise in CSF 3-methoxytyrosine concentration. No change was observed in CSF methionine concentration and in all patients CSF 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentration was normal. With one exclusion there was a linear relationship between CSF S-adenosylmethionine and 3-methoxytyrosine concentrations. This is the first demonstration of such effects in humans and the implications upon levodopa therapy are discussed.\r"

Thus depression in patients with migraine seems unlikely to be secondary to migraine per se. A substantial subgroup of patients with migraine may possess an inherent predisposition to endogenous depression.\r"

Both the simulated driving reaction time and the accuracy of steering were significantly impaired in the PD group compared with the controls. Both of these measures correlated significantly with the severity of PD as measured on Webster's rating scale. Caution may be needed if the findings of simulated tests are to be extrapolated to real driving. However, our findings show that the severity of disability in PD as measured by Webster's rating scale may assist in assessing the fitness of a PD patient to drive.\r"

They had difficulty, however, in maintaining a sequence if two different ones had been learnt and subjects were required to switch spontaneously from one to the other within a trial. Providing external cues at the start of each sequence to guide the ordering of movements improved the stability of patients' performance. Most errors in sequencing consisted of reverting to the alternative pattern of movement.

  ".W": "We examined covert orienting attention in twenty patients with Parkinson's disease using Posner's reaction time (RT) method. Patients were divided according to the grade of severity (Hoehn and Yahr), the P1 group was grade I-II and P2 group grade II-IV. Each group of patients was compared with an equal number of age-matched controls. In controls, and in the less disabled younger P1 group, a significant RT difference was shown between \"valid\" and \"crossed\" conditions, that is, when the cue and target appeared in the same square or in equivalent squares in opposite visual fields. In the P2 group, however, there was no advantage of the \"valid\" over \"crossed\" conditions. Furthermore, the RT difference seen in controls between \"valid\" and \"towards the fovea\" or \"away from the fovea\" (conditions where cue and target were in adjacent squares) disappeared in the Parkinsonian groups. These results suggest that the covert shift of attention from initial focus to the cue is very weak, or does not occur in more disabled Parkinsonian patients, resulting in only a shift of attention to the target. In considering the elementary mental operations involved in covert orienting attention, this deficit may be attributable to a disturbance of moving attention.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of depression and cognitive impairments was examined in seventy patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Forty nine patients of this original cohort were re-examined between three and four years after the first evaluation. While both depressed and non-depressed patients showed a significant decline in cognitive function during the follow up period, intellectual decline was significantly more severe for the depressed group. Depressed patients also showed a faster rate of progression of motor signs (mainly tremor) than the non-depressed group. Patients that died during the follow up period showed significantly more cognitive impairments than patients who were alive at follow up. These findings suggest that either there may be two forms of PD: one with depression and rapid cognitive decline and one without depression and a gradual cognitive decline; or that the mechanisms of cognitive impairment in PD and depression may interact to produce a more rapid evolution in cognitive impairment among PD patients with a previous depression than among patients without a previous depression.\r"

Subjects were presented tape-recorded speech filtered sentences and asked to indicate the tone of voice as happy, sad or angry (affective prosody), or as a question, command or statement (propositional prosody). HD patients were impaired in comprehension of both types of prosody compared to controls but were not different from stroke patients. A second study compared early HD patients with at-risk siblings and spouse controls on comprehension of affective and propositional prosody, discrimination of both types of prosody, rhythm discrimination and tonal memory (Seashore tests). HD patients were impaired in both comprehension and discrimination of all types of prosody. HD patients were less accurate than at-risk patients on the tonal memory task but not on the rhythm discrimination task. These findings suggest compromise in ability to understand the more subtle prosodic aspects of communication which may contribute to social impairment of HD patients very early in the course of the disease.\r"

The results indicate a significant prolongation in latency and a reduction in gain of horizontal saccades, and an increase in latency and reduction of peak velocity of large downward saccades. These findings suggest an organic component to the aetiology of blepharospasm, the pathology of which also appears to involve the oculomotor system. The pattern of the oculomotor disorder does not allow specific localisation but is consistent with the underlying pathology being localised in the basal ganglia.\r"

Seventy-one women were asked to perform bicycle exercise for 45 min at a moderate load; four proteins (creatine kinase - CK, myoglobin - Mb, aldolase - Ald and pyruvate kinase - PK) were measured in serum up to 24 h after exercise. Twenty-one women were carriers of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD); these are known to show an elevated serum CK activity at rest, as well as increased CK response after exercise. Fifty women without a family history of neuromuscular disease were tested to obtain normal values: they showed a small peak (18%) of CK activity 8 h after exercise, and an even smaller peak of Mb (9%) 1 h after exercise. The mean post-exercise increase for both CK and Mb in the 21 DMD carriers was significantly higher than in controls; the maximum of Mb, on average 70% of baseline levels, was reached 1 h after exercise and was higher than that for CK (48%), which was reached 8 h after exercise. It is concluded that myoglobin levels after exercise are a good index of increased vulnerability of the muscle membrane.\r"

Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been found to selectively induce epileptiform afterdischarges in the epileptic focus of candidates for epilepsy surgery who suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy. Lateralized serial transcranial magnetic stimulation was therefore used and serum levels of prolactin or luteinizing hormone were measured to find if it could be used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. The investigation was performed on six patients and five healthy volunteers. In the patients the induction of epileptiform potentials was continuously monitored via subdural electrodes. A transient surge of prolactin and luteinizing hormone was found in only one patient, in whom a complex partial seizure was induced. Thus, transcranial magnetic stimulation appeared not to be helpful for the lateralization of the (primary) epileptic focus during presurgical evaluation.\r"

Tingling and numbness of the fingers as well as weakness of the hand or arm were the most prominent presenting symptoms of RIBP. Whereas pain in most patients evolved only later in the course, it became a predominant feature in only 2. In 8 of the 12 patients, the plexopathy was surgically treated, either by neurolysis only or by neurolysis plus omental grafting in order to stop progression or paresis and/or pain. In 8 patients, including 6 of the operated group, there was slow and steady progression of RIBP over time, with the final outcome being almost complete paralysis of the arm (2 patients) or severe sensorimotor paresis rendering the hand useless (6 patients). In only 4 patients, including 2 of the non-operated group, was there absence of progression and stabilization of the paresis with only slight functional loss of the affected arm in 3 patients and severe palsy in 1. None of the 12 patients had any clear long-lasting improvement of their sensorimotor impairment. It is concluded from this study that RIBP, irrespective of surgery (neurolysis and/or omentum transplant), left two-thirds of the patients with severe or total paresis of the arm. However, the almost complete relief of severe pain (6 of 8 patients), both immediately and in follow-up patients treated with neurolysis and/or omental transplant, indicates that surgical treatment has a beneficial effect on pain relief.\r"

Female patients showed significantly worse global intellectual status than males. No difference in intellectual level was observed in patients with respect to age, extent of muscular involvement and sex of affected parent. No family pattern of cognitive impairment could be identified. Our results show that an extensive neuropsychological battery can reveal the existence of selective mental impairment.

Computed tomography (CT) was attempted in all those with cerebral ischaemic attacks (n = 152, 83%); patients with amaurosis fugax only (n = 32, 27%) were not scanned routinely. Scans were obtained in 120 (79%) of those with cerebral attacks and 12 (38%) of those with amaurosis fugax. The scans were reported by a neuroradiologist who was blinded to the patients' clinical features. Of 120 (27%:95% confidence interval 19-35) scans in patients with cerebral attacks, 32 showed a focal area of hypodensity or cortical loss, but in only 14 (12%:95% confidence interval 6-18) was this in an area of the brain appropriate to the patients' symptoms. There were no significant differences in the clinical features, the duration of attacks or the prognosis (i.e., risk of death, stroke or myocardial infarction) of patients with and without ischaemic lesions on CT. It is concluded that patients with clinically definite TIAs who have a presumed ischaemic and appropriately sited lesion on CT should not be re-classified as having had a stroke.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens serially obtained during long-term follow-up of two patients with Devic's neuromyelitis optica (DNO) were compared with 65 CSF samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). By statistical analysis, the CSF profile in DNO was found to differ from that observed in MS, mainly showing pleocytosis, blood-brain barrier damage, and absence of persistent immunoglobulin G synthesis within the central nervous system. Oligoclonal bands, detected with isoelectric focusing, were present in CSF of 92% of the patients with MS, and in three CSF specimens from one patient with DNO during the first 6 months after disease onset. The bands disappeared in two subsequent samples. This finding has never been described in MS. One patient with DNO had an apparent chronic-relapsing course probably due to steroid dependence. The clinical and CSF features of our cases favour the nosographic independence of DNO and MS.\r"

The sensory signs and symptoms disappeared in the 3rd and 4th years of treatment, respectively. Muscle cramps and pain subsided within 2 years, but mild proximal muscle weakness and atrophy persisted. The sensory distal latencies remained slightly prolonged and the electromyographic changes improved. This case shows that thyroid hormone replacement eliminates the neuropathic manifestations of severe hypothyroidism. In contrast, the myopathic features, such as weakness and muscle wasting, may persist despite maintenance of the euthyroid state.\r"

Diagnosis of incipient central pontine myelinolysis was based on acute brain-stem dysfunction, serum electrolyte disturbances, malnutrition with vitamin B1 (thiamine), B6 (pyridoxine) and B12 (cyanocobalamin) deficiency in combination with typical neuroradiological findings. Hypokalaemia but no disturbance in serum sodium levels was found in both patients. After correction of hypokalaemia and vitamin deficiency the patients showed complete recovery of neurological and neuropsychological function. The findings are interpreted as suggesting that disturbances in serum potassium levels as well as rapid correction of hyponatraemia may be associated with pontine swelling and dysfunction which, if undetected, leads to central pontine myelinolysis.\r"

  ".U": "90362165\r", 
  ".W": "Higher response rates in colorectal cancer have been observed with regimens that increase the cytotoxicity of fluorouracil (5-FU) by altering the biochemical milieu at its site(s) of action. Phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), which inhibits aspartate transcarbamylase and depletes uridine nucleotide pools in vitro and in vivo, selectively potentiates the antitumor activity of 5-FU in preclinical models. In a phase I/II study in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, PALA 250 mg/m2 was given on day 1, followed 24 hours later by 5-FU 2,600 mg/m2 by 24-hour infusion repeated weekly. Through the use of subcutaneous ports and portable infusion pumps, all patients were treated outside the hospital setting. Thirty-nine patients without prior chemotherapy received 884 courses of treatment. The primary site was colon in 31, rectum in eight. Toxicity was generally mild to moderate except among four patients who were escalated to 5-FU 3,250 mg/m2: two developed severe gastrointestinal toxicity and myelosuppression. Among the remaining 35 patients, gastrointestinal and neurologic toxicities predominated, but usually did not develop until the third or fourth month of treatment. Two patients were inevaluable for response. Among the 37 evaluable patients there were three complete and 13 partial remissions for a total response rate of 43% (95% confidence interval [Cl], 27% to 59%). The median duration of response was 5 months (range, 1.5 to 15 months). The projected mean survival is in excess of 17 months. This high response rate is comparable to the best results obtained with other means of modulation of 5-FU. Demonstration of a survival benefit will require larger phase III studies.\r"

  ".U": "90362166\r", 
  ".W": "Sixty-eight unselected patients with progressive metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were treated between March 1985 and November 1988 with continuous infusion floxuridine (FUDR). Thirty-seven percent of these patients had previously received and failed systemic treatment. Using implantable pumps for automatic drug delivery, FUDR was continuously infused for 14 days at monthly intervals. The starting dose was 0.15 mg/kg/d (intravenous [IV]; n = 61) or 0.25 mg/kg/d (intraarterial [IA]; n = 7); IV doses were increased or decreased in increments of 0.025 mg/kg/d as permitted by toxicity. Diarrhea (with or without mild abdominal cramping) and nausea/vomiting limited the FUDR IV infusion, and hepatic function abnormalities limited FUDR IA infusion. The use of a circadian-modified infusion schedule permitted high FUDR doses to be safely given as compared with a constant rate infusion schedule. Of 63 patients assessable for response, 56 received systemic FUDR infusion. Four complete responses (CRs; 7.1%); and seven partial responses (PRs; 12.5%) were observed (objective response rate, CR plus PR, 19.6 +/- 5.1% [95% confidence limits] ). The median objective response duration was 10.8 months (range, 1 to 18 months; mean, 9.4 +/- 1.6). Four additional patients had minor tumor responses (MRs; 7.1%). In a subgroup of seven assessable patients receiving hepatic arterial FUDR, we observed one CR and three PRs (57.2 +/- 42.8%). Overall, objective response (CR plus PR) was seen in a quarter of assessable patients treated, 15 of 63, while only 15 of the 63 assessable patients (25.4%) have had objective tumor progression. The median follow-up time for all 68 patients was 28 months (range, 1 to 42), and their median survival duration is 15 months (range, 3 to 37 months). Continuous infusion FUDR is an effective outpatient treatment for progressive metastatic RCC, producing durable tumor response and causing little toxicity.\r"

The study was open, dose ranging, and noncomparative, and designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of ondansetron in preventing nausea and vomiting caused by cyclophosphamide intravenous (IV) 1,000 mg/m2 day 1, and cytarabine IV subcutaneously (SC) 75 mg/m2 on days 2 to 5. Ten patients were given ondansetron 5 mg/m2 IV (group A) and subsequently another 10 patients were given ondansetron 3 mg/m2 IV (group B). Oral ondansetron was given for 14 doses, at the same dosage for both groups, commencing simultaneously with the IV infusion and continuing at 8 hourly intervals, ie, until day 5. The oral dose was based on surface area with the following schedule: 0.3 to 0.6 m2, 2 mg; 0.6 to 1 m2, 3 mg; and greater than 1 m2, 4 mg. Vomiting on the first day of chemotherapy was reported in group A by one patient and by one patient in group B. Vomiting during days 2 to 5 was reported by two group-A patients and by three group-B patients. Nausea was recorded on day 1 by one patient in group A, and two in group B, and on days 2 to 5 by three patients in group A, and by seven in group B. All patients were alert during treatment with ondansetron and there was no dystonia. There were no changes in renal function or hematology values that could be ascribed to the study drug. Transient elevations in bilirubin and liver enzymes were observed. We conclude that our results indicate that ondansetron is a safe and extremely effective single-agent antiemetic with minimal side effects, when administered both IV and orally.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to evaluate the radiocurability of microscopic disease in childhood rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) with total tumor doses of less than 4,000 cGy, we performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with microscopic residual RMS who were treated at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) during the years 1970 to 1987. There were 32 patients ranging in age from 3 months to 22 years (median, 6 years) with microscopic residual of either (1) a localized primary tumor (MSKCC, stage IB; Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study [IRS] group IIA), 19 patients; or (2) an involved lymph node region with the primary tumor completely resected (MSKCC stage III; IRS group IIC), 13 patients. Twenty-nine of the 32 patients presented with embryonal histology. All patients were treated with combination chemotherapy (CT) and megavoltage external beam radiotherapy (RT). The RT was delivered in either conventional fractionation of 180 to 200 cGy daily (30 patients) or hyperfractionation of 150 cGy twice daily (two patients). Fifteen patients received RT doses of less than 4,000 cGy with a range of 3,000 to 3,600 cGy and a median value of 3,100 cGy; 17 patients received 4,000 cGy or more with a range of 4,000 to 6,000 cGy and a median value of 4,600 cGy. With a median follow-up of 11 years, the relapse-free survival was 25 of 32 patients (less than 4,000 cGy, 12 of 15; greater than or equal to 4,000 cGy, 13 of 17). The RT local control rate was 30 of 32 (less than 4,000 cGy, 14 of 15; greater than or equal to 4,000 cGy, 16 of 17 [P = .94]). Our results suggest that radiation doses of below 4,000 cGy, when combined with effective multiagent CT, may be sufficient for local control of microscopic disease in childhood embryonal RMS.\r"

This phase I dose-escalation study was undertaken to investigate DDTC as a chemoprotector in patients with advanced cancer. Thirty-five courses of CP in doses ranging from 120 to 160 mg/m2 were given intravenous (IV) bolus to 19 patients. DDTC at 4 g/m2 was infused over 1 hour, starting 45 minutes after CP. There was minimal nephrotoxicity with a mean creatine clearance of 99 mL/min +/- 4 pretreatment and 86 mL/min +/- 4 on day 21. Two courses were associated with a WBC count less than 2,000/mm3 and one course with a platelet count of 15,000/mm3. Two patients had grade 2 neurotoxicity. Hearing loss occurred in 11 patients: five greater than or equal to 20 dB, five greater than or equal to 40 dB, and one greater than or equal to 60 dB. All patients who received cranial irradiation had ototoxicity compared with 43% of those without radiation (P less than .05). All patients experienced toxicity during the DDTC infusion, including hypertension, flushing, diaphoresis, agitation, and local burning. We conclude that DDTC can protect against CP nephrotoxicity at doses up to 160 mg/m2. Ototoxicity became the dose-limiting factor.\r"

The certainty, or near certainty, of suffocation was based on reliable observation or recording of the suffocation, maternal confession, or successful prosecution in a criminal court. Eighteen of the children are alive, although one has severe brain damage; nine are dead. Twenty-four were reported to have had previous episodes of apnea, cyanosis, or seizure, and 11 had had 10 or more such episodes that were either invented or caused by the mother. Repetitive suffocation usually began between the ages of 1 and 3 months and continued until it was discovered, or the child died, 6 to 12 months later. The 27 children had 15 live elder siblings and 18 who had died suddenly and unexpectedly in early life; 13 of the dead siblings had had recurrent apnea, cyanosis, or seizures, and, although most of them at the time of death were certified as having sudden infant death syndrome, it is probable that some were suffocated. Repetitive suffocation has a characteristic clinical presentation that should allow identification before brain damage or death occurs. The characteristics should also allow the cause of death of some cases of sudden infant death to be established more accurately.\r"

We studied 2850 children, aged 5 to 17 years, who had fasting lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein levels measured as part of the Bogalusa Heart Study. The test characteristics of apo B were superior to those of serum total cholesterol in screening children to detect elevated levels of LDL-C (greater than or equal to 95th percentile) and moderately elevated LDL-C levels (greater than or equal to 80th percentile). Unusually high or low values of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are responsible for most of the misclassification that occurs when measurement of total cholesterol is used as a screening test for identifying children with elevated levels of LDL-C. This confounding effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was eliminated when measurement of apo B levels was used as a screening test. Because the apo B test is more specific at a given sensitivity than the total cholesterol test, the apo B test can cost more and still be less expensive as a screening strategy. As the methods for determining apolipoprotein levels become standardized and readily available, the measurement of apolipoproteins could be developed into superior screening tests for the identification of patients with dyslipidemias.\r"

Treatment regimens differed among the children, but none had high salicylate levels (greater than 20 mg/dl) or received other ototoxic medications.

No significant differences were found between the two feeding periods for peak breath hydrogen levels and fecal osmolality. The low-CHO formula was tolerated better than the high-CHO formula, as indicated by a significantly lower stool output (mean +/- SD 387 +/- 230 vs 764 +/- 443 gm, respectively; p less than 0.05), and higher fecal pH (5.9 +/- 0.7 vs 4.9 +/- 0.5; p less than 0.05). Macronutrient absorption was greater during the ingestion of the low-CHO formula, as indicated by a significantly higher coefficient of fat absorption (p less than 0.005) and lower total fecal energy (mean +/- SD for high- vs low-CHO formula, 372 +/- 205 vs 207 +/- 102 kcal; p less than 0.05), which resulted from a lower CHO excretion (p less than 0.05). A correlation coefficient between the energy derived from CHO in feces and the total stool output was significant for both the high-CHO formula (r = 0.83; p less than 0.001) and the low-CHO formula (r = 0.7; p = 0.01). The CHO concentration of the special infant formula that we tested had an overriding effect on stool output and on fat and energy absorption.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the incidence of liver cirrhosis in children with chronic hepatitis, we investigated 92 children (64 were girls; mean age was 8 years 2 months) with chronic hepatitis for the presence of cirrhosis by the combined use of laparoscopy and needle liver biopsy, between 1975 and 1985. Forty-six children had hepatitis B virus-related chronic hepatitis; cirrhosis was present in 13 (32%). Cirrhosis was diagnosed by laparoscopy in 14 children and by needle liver biopsy in eight. In six patients, cirrhosis was diagnosed within the first 12 months after the clinical onset of liver disease. Forty-six children had autoimmune hepatitis; cirrhosis was present in 41 (89%). Cirrhosis was diagnosed by laparoscopy in all 41 children and by needle liver biopsy in 23 children. Cirrhosis was already present in all 10 children studied 2 to 5 months after the first sign of liver disease. Our results indicate that the incidence of cirrhosis is high in children with chronic hepatitis, especially of the autoimmune type, and that cirrhosis may occur early, irrespective of cause. A combination of laparoscopy and biopsy is more reliable than biopsy alone for the diagnosis of cirrhosis in children with chronic hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "Because growth failure is a frequent complication of chronic liver disease in childhood, we examined the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor type I axis and its relationship to growth disturbances, nutritional status, and carbohydrate metabolism in nine children (2.1 to 18.6 years of age) with chronic cholestatic liver disease. Seven had cholestasis associated with splenomegaly and histologic findings of cirrhosis; two patients had Alagille syndrome. Stature was less than or equal to 15th percentile in all except the youngest subject and less than 5th percentile in five subjects. Ten-hour, nocturnal, integrated serum concentrations of growth hormone were considerably higher in patients with cholestasis than in control subjects (mean +/- SD) 9.7 +/- 3.8 vs 4.7 +/- 1.9 ng/ml; p less than 0.02). Serum concentrations of insulin-like growth hormone type I were less than 95th percentile confidence intervals for age- and sex-matched norms in five patients and at the lower limits of normal in the remaining four patients. Insulin sensitivity, determined with the minimal model intravenous glucose tolerance test, was not decreased in five patients despite elevated levels of circulating growth hormone. The estimated mean caloric and protein intake exceeded the recommended dietary allowance and the weight-for-height index was greater than 90% for six of nine patients. Triceps and subscapular skin-fold thicknesses, indicators of body fat stores, were greater than 25th percentile for five of nine and eight of nine patients, respectively, suggesting deficient lipolytic action of GH. We conclude that children with cholestatic liver disease have a resistance to the growth-promoting, diabetogenic, and lipolytic properties of growth hormone.\r"

  ".W": "In 1985, Blau reported a family with 11 members in four generations affected by granulomatous arthritis, iritis, skin rash, and periarticular synovial cysts. We report a second family with these abnormalities, thereby confirming this syndrome as a distinct familial entity with transmission compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. Affected members in our family included a mother and two daughters. Disease onset was at 10 months to 8 years of age. Each had uveitis, symmetric polyarthritis, and synovial cysts overlying the ankle and wrist joints. In addition, both daughters had an intermittent generalized erythematous papular rash that on biopsy revealed noncaseating granulomatous infiltration. All three patients improved during alternate-day steroid therapy. Recognition of this disorder as distinct from other, more common causes of arthritis is important because of the apparent autosomal dominant transmission and because of the excellent responses to low-dose steroid therapy.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether stratifying hereditary spherocytosis by degree of severity could provide guidelines regarding which patients would benefit from splenectomy, we evaluated the clinical characteristics of 80 patients (63 children) and 27 healthy relatives. In addition to routine hematologic determinations, osmotic fragility, autohemolysis, erythrocyte spectrin content, and erythrocyte membrane lipid phosphorus were measured and correlated with the disease severity. Four categories were identified: (1) spherocytosis as a trait in symptom-free relatives of patients with recessively inherited disease; (2) mild and (3) moderate spherocytosis, largely observed in patients with dominantly inherited disease; and (4) severe spherocytosis, observed in only two patients, who were characterized by recessive inheritance and transfusion dependence. By the identification of carriers, a recessive mode of inheritance could be demonstrated in 20% of the families with spherocytosis. The erythrocyte spectrin concentration was normal in carriers and patients with mild spherocytosis, and was significantly reduced in the moderate and severe states of the disease. This difference was not accounted for by reduced membrane area of the cells, as measured by the phospholipid concentration per cell. We conclude that patients with mild spherocytosis usually do not require splenectomy during childhood and adolescence; patients with moderate or severe disease should have splenectomy. Patients with severe spherocytosis have a partial response to splenectomy but a considerable degree of increased hemolysis persists. Most patients with less than 80% of normal spectrin content require splenectomy.\r"
