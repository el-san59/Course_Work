  ".W": "Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a disturbance of mood and behavior which resembles some seasonal changes seen in lower mammals. Like these animal seasonal changes, SAD is thought to be related to decreased sunlight during winter months. [SAD has been successfully treated with exposure to bright artificial light of higher intensity than is usually present in the home or workplace. Many people not suffering from SAD may nonetheless have seasonal changes which could be helped by environmental light supplementation. Lighting standards in the home and workplace should be re-evaluated on the basis of new knowledge of the psychobiological effects of light.] We review the literature on SAD and discuss its public health implications in the context of a typical case presentation.\r"

The political relation between the US and Latin America has colored US domestic policy toward its populations of Latin American origin. From the beginning of US-Latin American relations, there has been a constant confusion of race for national origin, compounded by the adoption of euphemistic terms such as \"Spanish surname.\" The term \"Latino\", derived from \"Latin American,\" is offered as the term that best reflects both the diverse national origins and the nearly unitary treatment of Latinos in the US. The term Latino is operationalized to include all persons of Latin American origin or descent, irrespective of language, race, or culture. Specifically excluded are individuals of Spanish national origin outside the Western Hemisphere. When a synthetic sample has been derived, the term should be modified to reflect the basis upon which the sample was derived, e.g., \"Latino (Spanish surname).\" When working with Latinos from a specific national origin, that should be noted, e.g., \"Mexican origin Latinos.\"\r"

All 6 infected monkeys developed primary and satellite cutaneous leishmanial lesions which were measured for up to 30 weeks in 3 of the monkeys and up to 52 weeks in the other 3 monkeys. Two owl monkeys which had recovered from cutaneous leishmaniasis demonstrated acquired resistance when challenged with an intradermal inoculation of L. b. panamensis (WR 128). Reactivity of PBL from infected owl monkeys to PHA, Con A, and PWM was similar during primary and challenge infections to that observed prior to infection. Reactivity to leishmanial antigens was detected at 20 to 28 weeks post-infection (PI), became statistically significant after 28 weeks and remained elevated up to 52 weeks PI and after challenge infections. During primary infections DTH responses to leishmanin antigen were detected as early as 8 weeks PI, and continued up to 27 weeks PI. After challenge infections DTH reactivity was positive at 25 and 37 weeks, the only times the response was evaluated. The immunological responses of owl monkeys to L. b. panamensis were similar in many respects to those observed in humans with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis. This nonhuman primate model should be useful for future studies involving the immunology and chemotherapy of cutaneous leishmaniasis.\r"

There were quantitative differences among species in their levels of enzyme activity and in the sensitivity of the exoenzyme to inhibition by L(+) tartrate. Upon electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, extracellular acid phosphatase from L. braziliensis panamensis, L. tropica, and L. mexicana showed distinctive patterns which were similar for all isolates of a given species, while enzymes from L. donovani isolates differed from one another in relative electrophoretic mobility. Enzymes from all species appeared heterogeneous, showing either discrete multiple bands or single diffuse bands on gels stained for enzyme activity. Although the biological function of the extracellular acid phosphatase is presently unknown, the exoenzyme may be of value as a diagnostic or taxonomic characteristic.\r"

  ".W": "A vertical polyacrylamide gradient gel (3% to 7%) was designed to facilitate the electrophoretic resolution and classification of isoenzyme patterns of Entamoeba histolytica isolates. The following enzyme systems were used: phosphoglucomutase (PGM), hexokinase (HX), glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI), and malate dehydrogenase (ME). The modifications in the electrophoretic procedure and sample preparation allowed the reproducible comparison of enzyme patterns of axenic, monoxenic, and mixed cultures of E. histolytica isolated from humans. The clear distinction obtained in gradient polyacrylamide gels, between amebic isoenzyme bands and those from bacteria, renders this technique adequate for application to epidemiological studies where mixed cultures are used. The isoenzyme patterns of eight isolates from asymptomatic carriers, rigorously characterized by the absence of clinical, endoscopic, and serological findings were studied and compared with three well characterized pathogenic strains, cultured under axenic conditions. Our observations confirm the existence of distinct isoenzyme patterns for PGM, HX, and GPI in pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains, and reveal the consistent presence of more than one band for GPI. In addition, a previously undescribed band for GPI with an Rf of 0.64 in a carrier strain was found. The results suggest that while carriers usually harbor amebas with nonpathogenic isoenzyme patterns, pathogenic patterns also may be found in carriers.\r"

Microscopic examination of fecal specimens was performed upon enrollment, at 3-month intervals, and during episodes of diarrhea. Specimens were cultured for bacteria and samples of serum and saliva were collected for antibody studies (IgG and SIgA). The prevalence of G. lamblia infections was 5.2% and the incidence 11.8%. Children aged less than or equal to 10 years and newcomers were most frequently infected (P less than 0.02). Symptoms were present in 37% of the subjects infected with G. lamblia. A systemic antibody response was observed in 57% of symptomatic patients and 35% of asymptomatic subjects during the first 2 months of infection. The prevalence and the incidence of E. histolytica infection were 3.2% and 8.6%, respectively. Infections with E. histolytica were correlated with the duration of stay in Bangladesh; less than 1 year 7% vs. greater than 3 years 26% (P less than 0.01). Most expatriates infected with E. histolytica were asymptomatic (90%). Three adult patients, who were resident in Bangladesh for less than 1 year, were symptomatic but none of them developed dysentery or a serological response. Four of 25 asymptomatic subjects had significant antibody titers. Three of these people were seropositive for ameba at the beginning of the study. The local immune response, reflected by specific secretory IgA in saliva samples, correlated poorly with both E. histolytica and G. lamblia infections.\r"

Samples of the predominant species found at each site were assayed electrophoretically for species-specific variants of phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and trehalase (TRE). Enzyme identifications of flies and larvae were compared with morphological identifications to determine the accuracy of field identifications relying upon morphological characters. Enzyme identifications confirmed the accuracy of over 98% of the adult female identifications. S. yahense was found to be the predominant human-biting species at each site over the 10 months of sampling, with S. sanctipauli comprising a small percentage of the biting fly population. Species-specific larval enzymes confirmed the accuracy of more than 96% of the larval identifications. S. yahense was the predominant larval species found in smaller, more shaded, cooler breeding waters, while S. sanctipauli predominated in the single large watercourse that was sampled. Normally allopatric, mixed populations of these two larval species were found to exist at all sites, but sympatry occurred primarily during the wet season months of May-October. Biting activity of S. sanctipauli was found to be greatest during wet season months, and generally reflected the increase of S. sanctipauli in the larval populations of habitats dominated by S. yahense. The low human-biting activity of S. sanctipauli at all sites and during times which fostered large populations of S. sanctipauli larvae may be an indication of this specie's zoophilic tendency. Circumstantial evidence of hybridization, the expression of PGM and TRE species-specific variants for both species, was found in adults and larvae morphologically identified as S. yahense. The frequency of this \"hybrid\" condition, based upon PGM and TRE, was calculated to be comparable to the frequency of hybridization as determined by larval chromosome inversions.\r"

Antibody titers to a salivary gland antigen increased progressively as determined by the following tests: passive hemagglutination, agar gel double immunodiffusion, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Rabbits challenged with 20 ticks displayed declining titers with advanced frequency of challenge and few of the rabbits in this group developed paralysis. There was no decline in antibody titers in groups of rabbits exposed to 50- and 100-tick loads.

  ".W": "Thogoto (THO) virus, a candidate orthomyxovirus, replicated in and was transmitted by larvae, nymphs, and adults of the brown ear tick, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Larvae fed on viremic hamsters (10(7-8) PFU/ml blood) acquired an average of 10(2.5) PFU per tick. Following engorgement the titer dropped to 10(1.9) PFU on day 2 but increased by day 6 to 10(3.3) PFU. Virus survived transstadially in these ticks as demonstrated by the fact that, on day 10, newly moulted nymphs contained, on average, 10(3.5) PFU/tick. When 10 such infected nymphs were placed on a hamster a fatal infection of the animal developed involving a viremia of 10(6.7) PFU/ml blood. Another group of 6 infected nymphs did not elicit a detectable viremia in a hamster, or cause death. However the animal seroconverted to THO, virus indicating that virus transmission had occurred. Following acquisition of THO virus at the larval stage, virus was detected in adult ticks 138 days later. Uninfected nymphs fed on viremic hamsters acquired an average of 10(4) PFU/nymph. No virus was detected in the nymphs 4 days post-engorgement. Virus was, however, recovered by 6 days post-engorgement (10(4.7) PFU/nymph). Virus persisted transstadially as shown by the presence of an average of 10(3.4) PFU in newly moulted adults. Three groups of these infected adults (5-6 ticks/group) induced viremia in hamsters with blood titers of the order 10(2.8-3.5) PFU/ml. Virus persisted in engorged adults for up to 66 days following nymphal engorgement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dispersal of Aedes aegypti aegypti adults within Shauri Moyo, an African village in the Rabai area north of Mombasa, Kenya, was studied using the mark-release-recapture method. A total of 920 mosquitoes were captured and uniquely marked, of which 828 (90%) were released and 332 (40%) recaptured. A great majority of mosquitoes were recaptured once, but some individuals were recaptured up to 10 times. Most females visited 1 or 2 houses (40.8%, 44.9%, respectively), but there were females that visited as many as 5 houses. Mosquito movement among houses of the village is summarized in tables. Dispersal ability of Aedes aegypti females was d = 0.592 and males d = 0.433. The maximum distance females and males moved per 24 hr was 154 m and 113 m, respectively. The mean distance rate was 57.0 m/day for females and 44.2 m/day for males. The size of the mosquito population at Shauri Moyo village was estimated to be 331.1 +/- 146.5 using the Lincoln index method, 533.3 by the Fisher and Ford method, 270.3 +/- 179.5 by Bailey's triple catch method and 380.1 +/- 92.9 by the Jolly-Seber method. The mean female and male survival was 10.7 and 5.8 days, respectively. The maximum survival of females was 42 days and males 18 days. The daily survival of females and males estimated by the Fisher and Ford method was 0.825 and 0.693, respectively. The daily survival estimated using the Jolly-Seber method was 0.852 for females and 0.532 for males. Longevity is discussed in relation to extrinsic incubation periods of yellow fever and dengue viruses. The recapture rates, survivorship, and size of the village population indicate that the Ae. aegypti population in Shauri Moyo village is fairly stable. Presence or absence of blood in the stomach, and developmental stages of the ovaries were measured, showing that the majority of females fed twice and some fed as many as 3 times during one gonotrophic cycle.\r"

All Jamestown Canyon isolates were from Aedes stimulans, including 1 from a pool of newly emerged males and 2 from pools of newly emerged females. These 3 isolates suggest that Jamestown Canyon virus is transovarially transmitted by Ae. stimulans. All isolates of trivittatus virus came from pools of Ae. trivittatus. No isolates were obtained from greater than 4,000 tabanids collected along with the mosquitoes those years. Transmission trials with field-collected newly emerged adult female Ae. stimulans demonstrated a mean midgut infection rate of 44%, a disseminated infection rate of 16%, and an oral transmission rate of 12% to suckling mice. Precipitin tests of field-collected bloodfed female mosquitoes indicated that white-tailed deer were the preferred host for numerous mosquito species including Ae. stimulans. The results of this study suggest that Ae. stimulans is a primary vector of Jamestown Canyon virus and that transovarial transmission is the probable overwintering mechanism for this California group virus.\r"

Relatively high rates of such transmission were observed in Ae. taeniorhynchus and vertical transmission to F1 adult progeny and venereal transmission from males to females also were demonstrated with this species. Larval rearing temperature affected transstadial transmission of the virus in Ae. taeniorhynchus, especially to the adult stage. Such transmission was observed with a larval rearing temperature of 18 degrees C but not at 27 degrees C. Because of the abundance and distribution of Ae. taeniorhynchus in Florida, and the relatively high rates of vertical transmission of SLE virus observed in the present experiments, this mosquito species warrants further investigation as a possible overwintering host for the virus in that locality.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of successive lytic passage of yellow fever virus on mosquito infection and transmission rates in the vector, Aedes aegypti, was determined. Three strains of yellow fever virus from Trinidad and Peru were passaged five times in suckling mouse brains and seven times in BHK-21 cells. Mosquitoes were fed meals containing passaged and unpassaged viruses and infection and transmission rates were compared. Rates were similar for all but one of the three virus strains grown in both substrates with the exception of virus strain 1899/81 (human isolate from Peru) passaged seven times in BHK-21 cells. Infection rates declined from 62% (109/177) to 35% (61/176), and transmission rates declined from 64% (60/94) to 45% (22/49). The oligonucleotide fingerprint of strain 1899/81 passaged seven times in BHK-21 cells shared 98% (45/46) of its large, T1-resistant oligonucleotides with the parent strain, indicating limited biochemical differences. The data suggest that uncloned yellow fever virus populations, passaged a limited number of times, and exhibiting some phenotypic changes, are representative of the original virus strain and can be used with a reasonable degree of confidence in vector competence studies.\r"

All patients underwent one of three forms of treatment: the classic Sistrunk operation, a modified Sistrunk operation, or excision of the cyst only. Eleven percent had undergone a previous procedure. The majority of patients were found to have a cyst in the midline at the level of the hyoid bone. Eighty-eight percent of the patients underwent excision of the midportion of the hyoid bone. There were no postoperative deaths and the perioperative complication rate was 20 percent, the majority being wound-related. All recurrences took place within 4 months of operation. Factors that appeared to be associated with an increased risk of complications and recurrence included young patient age (less than 10 years), rupture of the cyst at the time of operation, infection, and failure to excise the midportion of the hyoid bone and the suprahyoid tract. One patient was found to have a mixed papillary and follicular carcinoma in the thyroglossal duct. We support the original premise of Sistrunk that \"the cure of thyroglossal cyst are unsuccessful unless the epithelium-lined tract, running from the cyst to the foramen cecum is completely removed,\" including the hyoid bone.\r"

Three age- and sex-matched groups were established according to adenoma weight. Compared with Group 1 patients who had adenomas of less than 1 g, Group 3 patients with adenomas of more than 2 g demonstrated significantly higher preoperative serum parathyroid hormone and calcium levels, and significantly lower preoperative serum phosphate levels. Multiple regression analysis revealed a strong correlation between adenoma weight to preoperative parathyroid hormone and calcium levels (r = 0.63, p less than 0.001). These results suggest that larger adenomas may be associated with a more severe form of primary hyperparathyroidism. The incidence of transient postoperative hypocalcemia in the 51 patients who underwent adenoma excision was 37 percent. Permanent hypoparathyroidism did not develop in any of them. Compared with Group 1 patients, Group 3 patients demonstrated a higher incidence of postoperative transient hypocalcemia (69 percent versus 14 percent in Group 1, p less than 0.001) and significantly lower mean serum calcium levels on the third and fourth postoperative days. Increased adenoma weight may be a valuable aid in identifying those patients at risk for transient hypocalcemia after neck exploration.\r"

All eight patients were, however, clinically suspected to have associated cervical spine injury before emergency cervical radiography. One hundred thirteen patients (28 percent) did not undergo emergency cervical radiography based on clinical evaluation, and none was subsequently found to have a missed cervical spine injury. There was no correlation between severity of head injury and the presence of associated cervical spine injury (p greater than 0.16). Head trauma is infrequently associated with cervical spine injury and when present is usually not clinically occult. Emergency cervical radiography is not efficacious and should not be routine in the emergency room management of head trauma. When associated cervical spine injury is clinically suspected, adequate cervical immobilization should be maintained and cervical radiography performed on a low priority basis. Head injury due to automobile and pedestrian or motorcycle and automobile accident may be more likely to be associated with cervical spine injury.\r"

The predominant reason for laparotomy was diagnostic peritoneal lavage (63 percent of patients). Plain abdominal roentgenograms were helpful to confirm diaphragmatic missile traverse.

Patients with isolated stab wounds to the thorax, especially those with cardiac injuries, had the best survival rate of any subgroup in the series. If emergency center thoracotomy was utilized for patients with some vital signs on admission and with neck or truncal gunshot wounds, blunt trauma, or abdominal trauma, the survival rate decreased to 2 to 4 percent; however, the small but constant survival rate in all of these groups justifies its continued use.\r"

Fourteen patients reached the emergency department with stable vital signs. Of these patients, 10 underwent successful treatment (71 percent). Despite advances in many areas of trauma care, blunt trauma of the aorta remains a highly lethal injury. However, this review has demonstrated that with prompt diagnosis and treatment, a significant number of these patients can be salvaged. It is for this reason that we have adopted an aggressive approach toward victims of blunt trauma. We now proceed with diagnostic aortography in any patient who has undergone a significant deceleration injury.\r"

Mean burn size was 27 percent of the total body surface area, whereas the mean full-thickness burn size was 13 percent of total body surface area. Twelve percent of children had associated inhalation injuries. The mean amount of fluid received during burn shock resuscitation was 5.8 +/- 0.25 ml/kg per percentage of total body surface area burned and the mean amount of sodium, 1.06 +/- 0.04 mEq/kg per percentage of total body surface area burned. There was no morbidity due to fluid overload. The presence of inhalation injury did not increase fluid or sodium requirements, but did increase mortality (29 percent versus 7 percent, p less than 0.05). The resuscitative mortality rate for all pediatric patients was 7 percent, the in-hospital mortality rate was 15 percent, and the 50 percent mortality burn correlate for these patients was 64 percent of the total body surface area. Data on children with burns were compared with an unselected, concurrent group of adult burn patients using an analysis of covariance. Fluid and sodium requirements were significantly higher for children, but there was no difference in the length of resuscitation or mortality rate. We conclude that children require much more fluid for resuscitation from burn shock than adults with similar burns. Appropriately aggressive fluid therapy for acute thermal injury in children is essential to achieve an acceptable survival rate in these patients.\r"

Progress in this area with improved survival rates is difficult to demonstrate despite the use of antibiotics, nutritional support, and aggressive maintenance of function of failed organs. This report documents our experience with planned reoperation to cleanse the abdominal cavity in 77 patients with generalized intraabdominal infection. In 34 of the patients, reoperation to cleanse the abdominal cavity was performed every 24 to 48 hours after the first operation until the abdominal cavity was judged to be clean. Forty-three patients underwent a single operation for intraabdominal contamination and were treated expectantly, only undergoing reoperation for signs of recurrent infection. In all patients, the hole in the intestinal tract was controlled primarily by stoma formation at the initial operation to treat intraabdominal infection. Patients with appendiceal disease were excluded. The severity of illness in the two patient groups was compared by a modified acute physiologic score. Planned reoperation was not associated with improvement in survival when compared with patients managed expectantly. Patients managed by planned reoperation had significantly more laparotomies than patients managed expectantly without improving survival. The results of this study disclosed that empiric reoperation to clean the abdominal cavity in patients with generalized intraabdominal infection produced no improvement in survival when compared with observation and reoperation when indicated.\r"

There were no differences between the two groups for operative time, anesthesia time, blood loss, maximum or minimum blood pressures, postoperative hemodynamic data, or the requirement for or duration of intravenous pressor or antihypertensive medications. One patient in the regional group had a postoperative neurologic deficit which resolved in 1 month. Three patients in the general group had cardiovascular complications. Postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in the general anesthesia group (5.6 to 3.2 days, p = 0.003). Regional and general anesthesia produce similar perioperative hemodynamic and surgical outcomes, but regional anesthesia results in a shorter hospital stay and less cardiovascular morbidity in this high risk population.\r"

Systolic blood pressure and pulse rate were recorded before injection and at 5 and 30 minutes after injection. The need for intraoperative and postoperative use of systemic vasopressor and vasodilator medications was recorded for each group as was the incidence of arrhythmias, neurologic complications, and myocardial infarctions. Intraoperative local anesthetic injection of the carotid sinus nerve did not significantly influence the intraoperative pulse rate or incidence of hypotension. It did, however, significantly increase the incidence of intraoperative hypertension and the need for systemic vasodilator medications intraoperatively. The incidence of postoperative hypotension (6 percent of patients), hypertension (34 percent), arrhythmias (6 percent), cerebrovascular accidents (1 percent), transient ischemic attacks (3.1 percent), and myocardial infarctions (2 percent) were not significantly influenced by intraoperative local anesthetic injection of the carotid sinus nerve. Intraoperative and postoperative hypotension did not cause morbidity in this series, however, local anesthetic injection was associated with a significant incidence of perioperative hypertension. Routine prophylactic local anesthetic injection of the carotid sinus nerve cannot be recommended in view of its detrimental effects in relation to the development of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Thirteen patients with internal carotid occlusion underwent 14 primary external carotid revascularization procedures over a 31 month period. Ten patients had obliteration of their internal carotid stump combined with patch angioplasty of the external carotid artery, and 3 had vein bypasses from the common carotid artery to the external carotid artery. Eleven patients were symptomatic with either amaurosis fugax or hemispheric transient ischemic attacks. Two patients were asymptomatic. All patients had serial carotid noninvasive tests (B-mode ultrasonography, spectral analysis, and oculoplethysmography). The mean follow-up was 22 months. Recurrent amaurosis fugax secondary to recurrent stenoses developed in two patients. These were correctly predicted by B-mode imaging and altered flow characteristics on spectral analysis. Both patients were successfully treated with reoperative procedures to prevent failure of the primary reconstruction. External carotid revascularization is a safe and durable procedure, but careful periodic follow-up is necessary to detect stenoses developing at or remote from the initial operative site. Carotid noninvasive tests appear to be helpful in detecting recurrent disease. Carotid revascularization is superior to other forms of therapy in patients who have development of neurologic symptoms ipsilateral to a chronically occluded internal carotid artery.\r"

Analysis demonstrated that suprainguinal occlusions of arteries and grafts were most likely to both lyse (89 percent) and remain patent for 6 months (86 percent). Arteries and graft occlusions had approximately the same incidence of thrombolytic recanalization (79 percent versus 74 percent). Arteries, however, had a higher incidence of 6 month patency than grafts (71 percent versus 41 percent). The inability to clear all flow-limiting lesions from the reopened portion of the vascular tree makes it highly likely that reocclusion will occur before 6 months. As a group, infrainguinal synthetic bypass grafts had the lowest patency rate at 6 months (26 percent), and suprainguinal arteries the highest rate (92 percent).\r"

The most important finding in this study of 1,463 patients with vertical gastroplasties was the development of a safe and practical use of a Silastic ring to permanently support the outlet. Using an uncovered Silastic ring, erosion of the ring has not been observed and long-term weight loss of 36.7 percent of original weight or 63.4 percent of excess weight has been obtained, which is equivalent to that reported for gastric bypass or other gastric reduction procedures. In addition, lower mortality and lower morbidity rates have been achieved than those reported in studies using other gastric reduction methods. Silastic ring vertical gastroplasty with an uncovered ring is the safest and most effective of the gastric reduction procedures in our experience.\r"

Fifty patients, with previous operations ranging from biliary and gastric procedures to thrombosed distal splenorenal shunts, were compared with 102 previously unoperated patients. This comparison led to the conclusions that side-to-side direct portacaval anastomosis may be carried out in patients with a previous major abdominal operation without an increased risk in mortality or morbidity, and that although intraoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements were increased in previously operated patients, these factors (along with operative time) could be minimized by use of intraoperative vasopressin and electrocautery. Thus, alternative shunting procedures, with their increased thrombosis and rebleeding rates, need not be considered in such patients.\r"

In 29 cases the attempt to provide an epidural was abandoned before the operation started. In regard to this, the importance of monitoring the fetal heart rate during initiation of the epidural is emphasised. In 10 cases general anaesthesia was induced after delivery, and in a further 108 cases supplemental analgesia was administered, either systemically, by inhalation or by an additional epidural top-up, after delivery. Satisfactory analgesia throughout the operation was achieved in 87.8%. In an appreciable proportion of cases the recommended maximum dose of bupivacaine, and the recommended maximum rate of bupivacaine administration, were exceeded without apparent complication. There was a tendency for the volume of Hartmann's solution infused intravenously before and during initiation of the epidural to be increased throughout the period under review (1971-85). The prevalence of hypotension diminished during that period. Characteristics of the data did not permit a close analysis of the main factors which could have led to an episode of maternal hypotension. However, it did appear that such an episode could be ascribed to too brief an interval between the first and second, or the second and third top-up doses. The frequency with which blood was transfused during operation was markedly lower than that noted in a concurrent series of elective sections conducted under general anaesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients were anaesthetised using methohexitone (40-100 mg) and suxamethonium (25-50 mg). In group 1 (n = 48), the patients' lungs were ventilated manually with oxygen in air (40-50%) during the modified convulsion. In group 2 (n = 47), the convulsion was allowed to subside before recommencing manual ventilation with a similar gas mixture. Eight patients in group 1 and seven patients in group 2 received more than one shock and were excluded, leaving 40 patients in each group. In group 1, one patient had a minimum oxygen saturation of less than 90% after the electric shock as opposed to 11 in group 2 (p less than 0.01). Five of the patients in group 2 had a saturation of less than 80%. It is concluded that patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy should be ventilated with an oxygen-enriched gas mixture during the convulsion induced by the electric shock in order to avoid hypoxaemia.\r"

This investigation was performed on the basis of favourable results obtained in an earlier 25 patient pilot study designed to examine the efficacy, safety and patient acceptability of buccal morphine 10 mg tablets as pre-anaesthetic medication. Both studies and sets of results are presented and show that, whilst buccal morphine is a safe alternative means of delivering opioid premedication, which is acceptable to the majority of patients, an equivalent intramuscular morphine dose is nevertheless a more effective premedicant in terms of anxiolysis and wakefulness, as assessed by linear analogue scores. Pharmacokinetic considerations are advanced both to explain the differing clinical efficacies of the two means of morphine administration and to indicate that improved per- and immediate postoperative analgesia might be obtainable in patients premedicated with buccal morphine.\r"

Twenty-three patients (19%) showed evidence of tolerance and were given droperidol 1.25-5.0 mg epidurally. In 20 patients in this study, there was a significant reduction in the number of epidural opioid injections. Six patients complained of excessive sedation, which disappeared when the dose of droperidol was reduced, although this did not affect the analgesia. One patient given an accidental overdose of droperidol developed reversible Parkinsonism. It is concluded that epidural administration of the dopamine antagonist droperidol may be beneficial as supplementary medication to epidural opioids when tolerance develops.\r"

More in the epidural group had a very good night's sleep during each night studied.

  ".W": "The ability of edrophonium and neostigmine to antagonize nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade produced by steady-state infusions of atracurium, pancuronium, and vecuronium was studied in 71 adult patients anesthetized with nitrous oxide and halothane. Infusion rates of blocking drugs were adjusted so that single twitch depression as measured by the evoked integrated EMG of the hypothenar muscles was kept at 10% of control. Two minutes after the termination of the infusion either edrophonium (0.75 mg/kg) or neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) was administered. Single twitch depression and train-of-four (T4/T1) fade was recorded during the recovery period. T4/T1 fade ratios observed at 20 min postreversal were 0.80 (atracurium-edrophonium); 0.76 (vecuronium-edrophonium); 0.44 (pancuronium-edrophonium); 0.95 (atracurium-neostigmine); 0.89 (vecuronium-neostigmine); and 0.68 (pancuronium-neostigmine). Under conditions of this study neostigmine produced more rapid and complete recovery than did edrophonium. Although edrophonium produced adequate antagonism of atracurium if 20-30 min were allowed to elapse, edrophonium reversal of pancuronium was rarely acceptable even at 30 min. Increasing the dose of edrophonium to 1.0 mg/kg produced single twitch values of 0.90 at 5 min postreversal but did not increase the rate of recovery of the train-of-four fade ratio. Neostigmine reversal of pancuronium, on the other hand, generally produced T4/T1 ratios of greater than 0.70 in 20-30 min. Although the pattern of recovery seen after reversal of vecuronium was in general quite similar to that seen after atracurium, two patients in the vecuronium-edrophonium group showed delayed recovery and also failed to respond significantly to subsequent doses of neostigmine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The relationship of train-of-four (TOF) ratio to the depression of the first twitch (TD) was investigated in 16 patients given pancuronium in doses insufficient to eliminate the fourth response in the train. In ten patients the block was allowed to spontaneously recover (Group 1) and in six it was reversed with neostigmine (Group 2) once maximum depression of TOF ratio had occurred. Maximum depression of the first response occurred in 6.5 +/- 4.3 min (mean +/- SD). Maximum depression of the TOF ratio was not present until 28.0 +/- 11.0 min. TOF ratio was usually still decreasing when recovery of TD had begun. However, once the TOF ratio began to recover, the recovery rates for TD and TOF ratio were similar in both the spontaneously recovering and the reversed groups. TOF ratio at complete TD recovery was 74.9 +/- 15.7 and 86.2 +/- 15.4% for the two groups. A kinetic analysis yielded significantly different elimination rate constants for the two effects from the \"effect compartment.\" These findings suggest that these two effects of pancuronium are exerted at different sites.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of three anesthetic induction agents on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were assessed in unpremedicated patients who were without neurologic abnormality of the upper extremities. SEP was assessed by stimulation of the nondominant median nerve and responses were recorded over Erbs point (N10), second cervical vertebra (N14), and the contralateral cortex (P15, N20, P23 latencies, and P15-N20 and N20-P23 amplitudes). Nine patients received thipental (4 mg/kg, iv bolus), nine patients received fentanyl (25 micrograms/kg, iv bolus), and nine patients received etomidate (0.4 mg/kg, iv bolus). SEP was assessed before and after drug administration at motor threshold stimulus intensity. Thiopental increased the latency of N10, N14, and N20. The amplitudes of N10-, N14-, and scalp-recorded waves were not altered by thiopental. Fentanyl increased N20 and P23 latency and decreased the amplitude of P15-N20. Etomidate increased latency of N20 and P23 without alteration of latencies of N10 or N14 and increased the amplitude of P15-N20 and N20-P23, while the amplitude of N10 was unchanged and the amplitude of N14 was decreased. It is concluded that thiopental or fentanyl causes only modest alterations in early waves of upper extremity SEP, whereas etomidate increases the amplitude of scalp-recorded waves. The effect of etomidate on SEP may make diagnosis of neurologic injury more difficult because of the changing waveform.\r"

Fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) administration increases the ATP concentration of blood. The authors hypothesized that FDP might increase the number of rabbits that could be resuscitated from hypoxemic cardiac arrest. To test this hypothesis, heart rate, arterial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and blood gases and pH were measured during normoxemia (FIO2 = 0.21) and again during hypoxemia (FIO2 = 0.04) in 28 adult, white, New Zealand rabbits anesthetized with pentobarbital. With the onset of hypoxemia, we gave either 40 mg/kg of 5% FDP (n = 10), 5% glucose (n = 11), or an equal volume (2.5 ml) of normal saline (n = 7) intravenously and began a continuous infusion of 2.0 mg X kg-1 X min-1 of the same sugar or 0.12 ml/min of saline. FDP-treated rabbits breathed for 20.9 +/- 4.9 (mean +/- SEM) min after initiation of hypoxemia; glucose-treated rabbits breathed for 1.4 +/- 0.2 min, and saline-treated rabbits breathed 10.3 +/- 4 min. Cardiac arrest occurred 2.5 +/- 0.5 min after the onset of respiratory arrest in FDP-treated rabbits, 4.1 +/- 0.2 min in glucose-treated rabbits, and 2.9 +/- 0.4 min in saline-treated rabbits. We could resuscitate all ten FDP-treated rabbits; two of 11 glucose-treated (FDP vs. glucose, P less than 0.001); and one of seven saline-treated rabbits (FDP vs. saline, P less than 0.001) from cardiac arrest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors compared changes in the electroencephalogram and somatosensory and auditory evoked potentials with eventual neuropathologic outcome. Our goals were: 1) to define the margin of safety for the monkey brain during hemodilution and hypotension under several simulated clinical conditions; and 2) to determine whether noninvasive measurements of brain electrical activity can predict ischemic brain cell damage. Forty-one monkeys were anesthetized with halothane (0.8 vol % inspired) and ventilated mechanically. Arterial hypotension was induced with trimethaphan (25 +/- 8 mmHg mean arterial blood pressure [MABP] for 30 min). Hemodilution was induced by replacing blood with lactated Ringer's solution (14 +/- 2% hematocrit for 1 h). Combined hemodilution and hypotension consisted of 30 min of hemodilution alone followed by superimposing hypotension for 30 min (16 +/- 3% hematocrit and 29 +/- 5 mmHg MABP). Ten monkeys died following severe hypotension alone or combined hemodilution and hypertension as a consequence of cardiac arrest or undetermined (possibly neurologic) causes. No histologic evidence of ischemic brain cell injury was found in surviving monkeys subjected to hemodilution or hypotension alone. Neuropathologic alterations in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and globus pallidus as well as neurologic and behavioral deficits were found in seven of 16 surviving monkeys subjected to both hemodilution and hypotension. These findings resulted from combinations of hematocrit less than 20% and MABP below 40 mmHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three different lidocaine doses were used as follows: a low dose (100 mg X kg-1 X day-1); an intermediate dose (250 mg X kg-1 X day-1); and a high dose (500 mg X kg-1 X day-1). In the low and intermediate dose groups, lidocaine was administered for two weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy to evaluate reproductive and teratogenic effects. In the high-dose group, lidocaine was administered from days 3 to 17 of pregnancy to evaluate teratogenic effects. On day 21, cesarean section was performed and all of the 1,040 offspring, including those from control and positive control (retinoic acid) groups, were preserved and subsequently examined microscopically to detect external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities. None was found in lidocaine-treated groups; reproductive indices also were normal. The only treatment effect was a reduction in mean fetal weight in the high-dose group. In a subsequent experiment this was found to be secondary to slightly delayed fetal development. It is concluded that lidocaine is devoid of significant adverse reproductive and teratogenic effects in Sprague-Dawley rats.\r"

Epinephrine (0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 micrograms/kg) and lidocaine (0.4 mg/kg, with and without 0.2 micrograms/kg of epinephrine) were administered intravenously to seven chronically instrumented pregnant guinea pigs near term. Lidocaine without epinephrine did not significantly alter maternal heart rate (MHR), maternal mean arterial pressure (MMAP), or UBFV. Epinephrine, with and without lidocaine, resulted in a transient decrease in MHR. Further, epinephrine, with and without lidocaine, resulted in significant elevations in MMAP and significant, dose-related reductions in UBFV. Mean (+/- SEM) UBFV was 72 +/- 4%, 56 +/- 4%, and 40 +/- 5% of baseline at 30 s after administration of epinephrine, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 micrograms/kg, respectively.

MAC for halothane was determined in rats (n = 24) before and after aminophylline, 100 mg X kg-1 ip, or an equal volume of saline. Because changes in central noradrenergic neurotransmission have been linked to drug-induced changes in the depth of the anesthetic state, we investigated the effect of aminophylline on the turnover of norepinephrine in discrete brain regions of halothane-anesthetized rats. To facilitate testing at steady-state aminophylline conditions and to permit frequent blood sampling, halothane MAC was determined in dogs (n = 7) before and after a therapeutic level of aminophylline (15 +/- 2 micrograms X ml-1) was obtained. Neither in the rats (1.0 vs. 1.0%) nor in the dogs (1.04 +/- 0.14 vs. 1.01 +/- 0.14%) was halothane MAC affected by aminophylline treatment. Commensurate with the lack of change of anesthetic depth, aminophylline treatment did not affect noradrenergic neurotransmission in the brain of halothane-anesthetized rats. Furthermore, the anticipated increase in circulating catecholamines following aminophylline treatment in dogs did not materialize. The authors conclude that halothane anesthetic requirements are not altered by aminophylline treatment, possibly because of the attenuation of the putative sympathomimetic effects of aminophylline by halothane.\r"

Therefore, in the present study these metabolites were measured in human muscle biopsies to find out whether normal individuals could be discriminated from MH-susceptible persons. Analysis of skeletal muscle metabolites was performed on skeletal muscle obtained from humans (n = 68) being screened to exclude or confirm susceptibility to MH. Three groups were identified based on the reaction pattern of a skeletal muscle sample exposed in vitro to caffeine or halothane 1% plus caffeine: 1) MH susceptible (MHS; n = 19); 2) normal humans, (controls; n = 31); and 3) intermediate-reaction type (K-type:n = 18). No significant differences were found in metabolite levels of phosphocreatine (normal, MHS, and K-type: 13.20 vs. 13.74 vs. 14.42 nmol/mg wet weight, respectively), creatine (16.30 vs. 16.94 vs. 15.06 nmol/mg wet weight, respectively), adenosine triphospate (3.75 vs. 3.98 vs. 3.89 nmol/mg wet weight, respectively) and lactate (3.73 vs. 3.65 vs. 3.79 nmol/mg wet weight, respectively). It is concluded that analysis of skeletal muscle metabolites cannot be used as a screening test to confirm or exclude MH susceptibility in humans.\r"

The authors used the procedure to examine 17 persons with healthy vessels, 36 patients with a degenerative occlusive disease of the peripheral arteries in Fontaine stages II-IV, and 5 patients with endangiitis obliterans. It is concluded that single measurements do not permit an assessment of microcirculatory conditions but that provocative tests (which are described), especially occlusion tests, make possible valid and reproducible statements and have a high selectivity with respect to the different stages of disease. By repeated measurements followed by calculation of mean values, a further reduction in intraindividual variability among the measurement results can be obtained. Laser-Doppler examinations of the skin constitute a new procedure with which quantitative statements on the blood flow through skin are feasible and from which interesting results can be expected, especially when used as an acute test.\r"

Intrapulmonary artery instillation of fibrinolytic agents was utilized except in 3 patients. There was a marked hemodynamic and arteriographic improvement (p less than 0.0005) in 33 patients (86.8%). Four patients (10.5%) died because of treatment failure. In these cases the fibrinogen concentration remained above 1 gr/liter during therapy. Bleeding was detected in 22 patients (57.8%) but was most often related to puncture or cut-down sites, and only 2 patients (5.2%) had major bleeding. One patient (2.6%) had cerebral hemorrhage. It is concluded that \"classic\" thrombolytic treatment is to be chosen in life-threatening pulmonary embolism. However, the difficulties sometimes encountered in producing an intense lytic effect and its low fibrinolytic specificity for the thrombus do not permit the obtainment of better results.\r"

  ".U": "87074280\r", 
  ".W": "Felodipine is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, and in hypertension it is a much more effective \"third-line\" drug than hydralazine. Nifedipine, on the other hand, is the established dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that has been increasingly used to treat hypertension. Information is now needed on the relative merits and demerits of these two drugs. This study appraised, therefore, the therapeutic utility of twelve months' treatment with nifedipine 20-60 mg twice daily in 55 patients with previous drug-resistant hypertension who had been successfully treated for the previous year with felodipine 5-20 mg twice daily, each calcium antagonist being used in combination with atenolol 100 mg daily with or without chlorthalidone 25 mg daily. Initially, nifedipine maintained comparable blood pressure control to that which had been achieved by felodipine, although in the longer term (over eight months) nifedipine proved less effective than felodipine had (p less than 0.02) and more patients became uncontrolled (supine diastolic blood pressure, Phase V, greater than or equal to 90 mmHg) on the maximum tolerated dose of the calcium antagonist (chi 2 = 4.13, p less than 0.05 greater than 0.025). The former degree of blood pressure control was, however, reestablished by increasing the dose of nifedipine or reintroducing the diuretic as necessary, and this control was maintained over the next four months. Minor side effects were less common on nifedipine than they had been during the preceding felodipine treatment phase. Felodipine thus has more pronounced and sustained antihypertensive effects than nifedipine, though its side effect burden may appear to be greater.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serum immunoglobulin and sIgA values were normal prior to surgery, and significantly lower afterwards. The data emphasize the importance of palatine tonsils not only in the synthesis of monomeric immunoglobulins but also in the synthesis of dimeric immunoglobulins in secretions. Although more long-term, follow-up studies supporting our results are needed, we suggest that a post-adenotonsillectomy drop in immunoglobulin and sIgA levels may predispose children to a constellation of disorders. We recommend, therefore, that serum immunoglobulins and sIgA levels be determined in all children before and after surgery.\r"

During the period of ventilator support, minute ventilation (VI), tidal volume (VT), and respiratory frequency (f) were similar in the 2 groups. After discontinuation of the ventilator, VI remained similar in the 2 groups, but VT was lower and f was higher in the patients who failed the trial compared with those who were successful, 194 +/- 23 and 398 +/- 56 ml (p less than 0.001), respectively, and 32.3 +/- 2.3 and 20.9 +/- 2.8 breaths/min (p less than 0.001), respectively. The failure group displayed a significant increase in PaCO2 (p less than 0.005) during spontaneous breathing, without a concomitant increase in the alveolar-arterial PO2 difference. Eighty-one percent of the variance in PaCO2 was accounted for by the pattern of rapid, shallow breathing. During weaning, resting respiratory drive (reflected by mean inspiratory flow, VT/TI) and fractional inspiratory time (TI/Ttot) were similar in the 2 groups. The patients in the failure group showed significant increases in VT/TI, 265 +/- 27 to 328 +/- 32 ml/s (p less than 0.01), and VI, 5.82 +/- 0.53 to 7.32 +/- 0.52 L/min (p less than 0.01), from the beginning to the end of the weaning trial; VT and f showed no further change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the role of a diaphragmatic fatiguing process in the genesis of this sensation has not been examined. Therefore, we studied the effect of fatiguing contractions of the diaphragm on inspiratory effort sensation (IES) in 6 normal male subjects during inspiratory resistive loading. Four diaphragmatic fatiguing and 4 diaphragmatic nonfatiguing patterns were developed for each subject. These 8 patterns were imposed in random order for 10 breaths (50 s) with duty cycle and tidal volume fixed. The presence or absence of a diaphragmatic fatiguing process was confirmed by analysis of the high to low ratio of the electromyographic signal from an esophageal electrode. Subjects scored their IES immediately after each run using a modified Borg scale. There was a very strong correlation between IES and esophageal pressure (Pes) expressed as a percentage of maximal inspiratory esophageal pressure (Pes/Pesmax %) (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001). However, IES was independent of the presence of a diaphragmatic fatiguing pattern. Furthermore, there was no difference in the slope or intercept of the regression lines relating IES to Pes/Pesmax % when fatiguing and nonfatiguing runs were analyzed separately. We conclude that the severity of IES during resistive loading held for 50 s is independent of the development of diaphragmatic fatigue.\r"

No attention is given to the patient's effort in performing tasks or to the functional impairment produced by dyspnea in everyday activities. To improve the effectiveness and scope of the assessment, the patient's magnitude of effort and task, as well as functional impairment, were combined in a recently developed new index of dyspnea. In the current research, this new index has been further improved and tested. The ratings have been cited with more precise criteria, and the results of the Modified Dyspnea Index created by the new criteria have been compared with results of the conventional Pneumoconiosis Research Unit score, and with physiologic measurements of pulmonary function. For 32 patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the Modified Dyspnea Index had a moderate correlation with the Pneumoconiosis Research Unit score (Spearman rho = -0.62) and with the FEV1 (Pearson r = 0.71) and FVC (Pearson r = 0.69). Among patients with the same Pneumoconiosis Research Unit score, however, the Modified Dyspnea Index scores showed a substantial gradient. Ratings with both the previous and the modified new dyspnea indexes correlated most strongly with respiratory muscle strength, supporting the idea that dyspnea is mediated by alteration of respiratory muscle function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has potent systemic vasodilator and endothelial-dependent relaxant effects on precontracted vessels. Pulmonary uptake and metabolism of ATP have been described, but experimental effects on pulmonary vessels remain controversial in animals. The effects of an intravenously administered infusion of ATP on pulmonary hemodynamic and gasometric data were assessed in 18 patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Low doses of ATP (successive rates, 1 and 2 mumol/kg body weight, each for 20 min) were infused in pulmonary hypertensive (H; n = 6) and nonhypertensive (N; n = 6) patients. They were compared with a control group (C; n = 6) that received only solvent, using ANOVA. During ATP infusion, a significant pulmonary vasodilation was demonstrated as simultaneous decreases reached, respectively, -14.2% (Group H; p less than 0.005) and -13.8% (Group N; p less than 0.001) for mean pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa), and -31.7% (H; p less than 0.05) and -20.7% (N; p less than 0.01) for pulmonary vascular resistances (PVR), associated with some worsening of hypoxemia: -6.9% (H; p less than 0.01) and -11.8% (n; p less than 0.005). After ATP withdrawal, significant rebound of these data (above baseline values) reached +10.9% (H; p less than 0.05) and +4.4% (N; p less than 0.05) for Ppa and +24.9% (H; p less than 0.05) and +10.2% (N; p = NS) for PVR. At the low infusion rate used, ATP appeared to be a well-tolerated, short-acting, selective pulmonary vasolidating compound in patients with COPD, but therapeutic use remains premature.\r"

Rats weighing 175 to 200 g were injected intratracheally with bleomycin sulfate (1.5 units) or saline. At 10 days, lungs from bleomycin-treated rats showed multifocal interstitial and intraalveolar fibrosis, a nearly 2-fold increase in total lung hydroxyproline, and a 3-fold increase in the incorporation of [3H]proline into bacterial collagenase-sensitive protein. For characterization of the newly synthesized collagens, lung slices were labeled for 4 h with [3H]proline, homogenized in 4.5 M NaCl, and extracted at 4 degrees C with 2 M guanidine-HCl and/or by reduction and alkylation. Extracts contained type IV procollagen, types I, III, and V collagen, and greater than 95% of the nondialyzable [3H]hydroxyproline. At 10 days, bleomycin-treated rats showed a nearly 2-fold decrease in the proportion of type IV in extracts of the 4.5 M salt residue, a greater than 3-fold increase in incorporation of proline into interstitial collagens, and an increase in the ratio of type I to type III collagen. Total incorporation of proline into type IV procollagen was not significantly increased. These results suggest that the period of maximal collagen synthetic activity observed at 1 to 2 wk after bleomycin administration is associated with a selective increase in the synthesis and accumulation of interstitial collagens.\r"

The sheep were evaluated periodically by pulmonary function tests (PFT), chest radiograph (CR), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and transbronchial lung biopsy (TLB). At Month 24 of the study, all asbestos-exposed sheep had significant increases in lung resistance and upstream resistance. However, only 9 of the 16 asbestos-exposed sheep had significant changes in TLB, CR, Cst, and VC, which clearly separated them from the other 6 sheep in these parameters. The 2 groups, however, had similar air-flow limitation. At lung biopsy, all asbestos-exposed sheep had significant peribronchiolar fibrosis, with significant alveolitis only in the group of 9 sheep with radiographic and functional changes of early asbestosis. The 9 sheep also had significant changes in BAL cellularity and biochemical profile, which differentiated them from the other 6 asbestos-exposed sheep. Analysis of BAL fiber content at that point revealed that despite identical exposure, the group with interstitial lung disease had significantly more fiber retention (p less than 0.01). The data demonstrate that whereas asbestos airway disease appears to be primarily an exposure-dose-related response, the lung response appears to be more closely related to alveolar retention of the dust.\r"

First, the relationship between SAB and morphologic findings in the airway was examined in 16 autopsy lungs. The irregularity indices of both central (C-II) and peripheral airways (P-II), obtained from SAB, showed a significant correlation with pathologic abnormalities in both airways (p less than 0.01). Second, SAB were obtained in 38 CB, 25 BA, and 62 CPE patients in whom pulmonary function tests were performed. In CB, C-II were significantly correlated with P-II (p less than 0.001). In CB, inspiratory lung resistance (RL) was significantly correlated with P-II (p less than 0.001) and with C-II (p less than 0.01), and FEV/VC% was significantly correlated with P-II (p less than 0.0001) but not with C-II. In BA and CPE, little correlation was observed between any SAB parameter and RL or FEV/VC%. We conclude that the present SAB parameters represent morphometric abnormalities of the central and peripheral airways, and that in CB, peripheral airway abnormalities correlated well with chronic airway obstruction.\r"

One hundred thirteen who were examined for gas effects in the forty-eight hours after exposure, including 20 of 23 of those hospitalized and 21 of 25 of those not hospitalized but with respiratory abnormality, participated in follow-up studies. Probability of admission to hospital was related to distance from the spill, but by 3 wk after exposure there was no detectable difference in lung function relating to distance or apparent severity of injury. In 60 adults tested multiple times over the following 6 yr, longitudinal change in lung function showed expected differences related to smoking but none related to distance or severity of injury. The average annual change in FEV was -34 ml/yr in current smokers and -18 ml/yr in ex and never-smokers. The lack of a discernible chlorine effect in this cohort accords with the findings in most previous studies. Without pre-exposure measurements, a single, lasting reduction in lung function cannot be excluded, but there is no evidence for a persisting abnormal rate of decline.\r"

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of 5 ppm NO2 exposure on membrane lipid fluidity, uptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and formation of lipid peroxides in porcine pulmonary artery and aortic endothelial cells in culture. After 3- to 24-h exposure, cells were labeled with 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), an aromatic hydrocarbon that partitions into the hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer of cell membranes. Membrane fluidity was monitored by measuring changes in rotational relaxation time (rho) for DPH by fluorescence spectroscopy. Reductions in membrane fluidity increase the value of rho. The 5-HT uptake was calculated from the disappearance of 1 X 10(-6) M 14C-5-HT from the medium, and LDH release and lipid peroxide formation were measured by spectrophotometric methods. The NO2 caused a significant increase in rhoDPH in both types of endothelial cells after 3 h and progressed with further exposure to NO2. Exposure to NO2 for 24 h, but not 3 or 12 h, significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced 5-HT uptake, increased (p less than 0.01) LDH release, and increased (p less than 0.05) lipid peroxide formation in both pulmonary artery and aortic endothelial cells. These results suggest that oxidant injury caused by NO changes the physical state of membrane lipids, impairs membrane function, and contributes to the biochemical and metabolic abnormalities in the cells.\r"

To determine if low level NO2 inhalation potentiates exercise-induced bronchospasm, 15 asthmatic subjects, defined by airway constriction with cold air provocation, inhaled 0.30 ppm (560 micrograms/m3) NO2 for 30 min. All asthmatics inhaled either air or 0.30 ppm NO2 via a mouthpiece for 20 min at rest followed by 10 min of exercise on a bicycle ergometer at a workload of 300 kpm/min, producing a 3-fold or greater increase in minute ventilation. Our studies showed 72 +/- 2 (SE)% deposition of inhaled NO2 at rest and 87 +/- 1% deposition with exercise (p less than 0.001). Nitrogen dioxide inhalation at rest resulted in no significant change in pulmonary function. Nitrogen dioxide inhalation plus exercise compared to control (air) exposure plus exercise produced significantly greater reductions in FEV (p less than 0.01) and partial expiratory flow rates at 60% of total lung capacity (p less than 0.05). One hour after completion of NO2 exposure and exercise, pulmonary function had returned to baseline values. To determine if NO2 exposure caused increased reactivity to a known bronchoconstrictor, asthmatic subjects inhaled cold air (range: -11 +/- 2 degrees C) at 3 successive rates of isocapnic ventilation. The response to cold air was expressed as the respiratory heat exchange required to reduce the FEV by 10% (PD10RHE). Prior NO2 exposure potentiated the fall in FEV, PD10RHE, and specific airway conductance (p less than 0.05) after isocapnic cold air hyperventilation, compared to the control exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This increased airway responsiveness is temporally associated with an increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the tracheal wall. To determine whether PMN play a mechanistic role in this increase in acetylcholine responsiveness, we studied the effects of PMN depletion on this response with 2 different cytotoxic drugs, hydroxyurea and cyclophosphamide. Airway responsiveness was measured in untreated, hydroxyurea-treated, or cyclophosphamide-treated animals while they breathed spontaneously or during mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. In untreated animals, exposure to TDI caused a significant increase in airway responsiveness to acetylcholine for both spontaneously breathing and anesthetized and ventilated animals. This TDI-induced increase in airway responsiveness was associated with a significant influx of PMN into both the extravascular and intravascular trachea. Treatment with hydroxyurea, to reduce PMN counts in the bloodstream to less than 200/mm3, inhibited both the TDI-induced increase in airway responsiveness and the TDI-induced influx of PMN into the trachea of both spontaneously breathing and mechanically ventilated animals. In mechanically ventilated animals, treatment with cyclophosphamide, until PMN counts in the bloodstream were less than 200/mm3, also inhibited the influx of PMN into the trachea but did not inhibit the TDI-induced increase in airway responsiveness. These results suggest that PMN are not necessary for the TDI-induced increase in airway responsiveness and that hydroxyurea inhibits this effect by a mechanism other than PMN depletion.\r"

In addition, we determined the influence of theophylline on human alveolar macrophage bacterial phagocytosis, intracellular killing, and hydrogen peroxide release. We found a 1:1 relationship between serum and bronchoalveolar lavage theophylline concentrations when lavage fluid concentrations were corrected for saline dilution. We found marked impairment of the bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages from theophylline-treated subjects (intracellular killing efficiency of 24.7 +/- 1.5% compared with 60.2 +/- 0.9% by macrophages from control subjects; p less than 0.001). This defect in alveolar macrophage bactericidal activity was inversely correlated with the bronchoalveolar lavage theophylline concentrations, and was corrected after the alveolar macrophages were cultured under serum-free conditions for 48 h. Theophylline significantly impaired alveolar macrophage release of hydrogen peroxide. Hence, theophylline may compromise lung host defenses by suppressing alveolar macrophage bactericidal activity and oxidative metabolite release.\r"

In this study, the following findings were obtained. With the peak concentration of IgM-RF, there was a decrease in pulmonary infiltration concomitant with a decrease in active IgG-IC. With a rapid decrease in IgM-RF, there was an exacerbation concomitant with an increase in active IgG-IC. In some cases the concentrations of IgM-RF were low in the acute phase of the disease and increased in the convalescent phase. Some patients with continuously low concentrations of IgM-RF had prolonged pneumonia. The existence of IgG-IgM-RF complexes in the bloodstream was shown.

However, postoperative reperfusion pulmonary edema (RPE) has been a serious complication, often requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. This entity has been described only anecdotally in the past. To characterize it more fully, we retrospectively analyzed the course and potential determinants of RPE after thromboendarterectomy in 22 patients who had PAT at our institution from 1969 through 1984. Particular attention was directed to clinical data, thrombus location, areas operated, postoperative roentgenograms, and preoperative and postoperative hemodynamic data. In all patients but 1, RPE developed within 72 h after surgery, corresponding to anatomic locations distal to vessels subjected to PAT. Regions of lung not reperfused at surgery were uniformly spared. Pulmonary capillary wedge and/or left atrial pressures preoperatively and postoperatively were not elevated. None of the preoperative data predicted which patients would develop more persistent RPE. These observations suggest that the phenomenon of RPE is a peculiar, focal form of pulmonary edema, the basis for which remains to be defined.\r"

While mast cells and tissue inflammation are thought to be vital to the development of the LPR, the precise pathogenesis of these responses remains under investigation. Using the Sprague-Dawley rat as a model to study cutaneous LPR, we have previously demonstrated that rat cutaneous LPR are mast cell-dependent and are histologically characterized by early (1-8 h) neutrophil-rich and late (8-24 h) mononuclear cell-rich infiltrates. To compare and contrast this cutaneous response with IgE-dependent pulmonary inflammatory responses, we performed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analyses of pulmonary inflammation following specific antigen challenge in actively immunized [IgE anti-ovalbumin (OA) antibody] and BAL and histologic analyses in passively sensitized [mouse hybridoma anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE antibody] rats. Following direct insufflation of OA into the trachea, actively sensitized animals demonstrated an increased number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) at 4 h in BAL fluid. These cell numbers were significantly increased over controls by 24 h following challenge. In addition, rats passively sensitized for 72 h with anti-DNP IgE hybridoma antibody (PCA = 1:10,000) were challenged with DNP-BSA aerosols. Examination of BAL fluid 1 to 2 h following challenge revealed significantly increased numbers of PMNs which returned to normal levels by 24 h. Numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages were unchanged compared to controls. Microscopic examination of lung tissue revealed alveolar and interstitial edema at 2 h following challenge and a focal peribronchiolitis characterized by a predominantly mononuclear cell infiltrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pulmonary edema is a common initial feature of paraquat toxicity, but its pathophysiology is not well understood. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the acute toxic effect of paraquat (30 mg/kg) on pulmonary transvascular protein and fluid fluxes, histologic features, and prostanoid production, using awake sheep with chronic lung lymph fistulas (n = 6). Lung lymph flow increased significantly 3.5 h after intravenous infusion of paraquat and rose to 2.6 times baseline within 8 h (from 4.4 +/- 0.4 to 11.4 +/- 1.5 ml/h, p less than 0.05). Lymph-plasma protein concentration ratio increased during the same time period (from 0.64 +/- 0.05 to 0.75 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.05). Lung lymph protein clearance also increased at 3.5 h and remained elevated throughout the duration of the experiment. Pulmonary arterial and left atrial pressure were only slightly altered. Plasma and lung lymph thromboxane A2 (as TXB2) concentrations were significantly increased at 30 min and continued so thereafter. Plasma and lung lymph prostacyclin (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) concentrations increased significantly at 3 h and were more than 5 times baseline by 7 h. The time course of the increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha concentrations seemed similar to that of lung lymph flow. The high flow of protein-rich lymph strongly suggested an increase in pulmonary vascular permeability, which may indicate pulmonary endothelial damage. Histologic studies of the lungs revealed only minor changes in perivascular cuffing, minimal alveolar hemorrhage, and slight neutrophilic alveolar wall infiltration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The isolated apoprotein could be recombined in the presence of Ca++ with the phospholipids dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol (3:1) at a weight ratio of 1:100. The surface tension (gamma min) measured on a pulsating bubble formed in 4 mg/ml of phospholipids was reduced from 32.3 +/- 2.0 dyn X cm-1 to 18.0 +/- 0.6 dyn X cm-1 after 15 s when 1% apoprotein was present. Reduction of disulfide bonds and deglycosylation of the apoprotein did not alter its ability to lower gamma min. Fetal rabbits of 27 days gestation had instilled intratracheally at delivery, saline, phospholipids, phospholipids plus apoprotein, or natural human surfactant. The latter 2 resulted in increased lung compliance and striking improvement in homogeneous alveolar expansion when the lungs were expanded to 10 cm H2O pressure, fixed, and viewed histologically. This effect was also shown to be independent of the disulfide-dependent oligomeric structure of the apoprotein or its state of glycosylation. The surfactant produced by recombination of the phospholipids with the isolated apoprotein was, therefore, shown to be biophysically active both in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that apoprotein can be recombined with phospholipids to produce a biologically active surfactant for use in clinical trials of human surfactant replacement.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which the circulating low density lipoproteins (LDL) contribute to the lung surfactant cholesterol was investigated by perfusing the hamster lung in situ with LDL either radiolabeled or coupled to gold, or both. Part of [125I]-LDL and [3H]-cholesterol LDL were taken up by a specific process which was time- and concentration-dependent and reached saturation within 20 to 30 min of perfusion. Competition experiments and removal of receptor-bound LDL by heparin suggested that about 50% of LDL uptake is receptor-independent. Experiments using double labeled LDL showed a preferential uptake of 3H-cholesterol versus 125I by the lung both in situ and in vivo. LDL-gold particles (LDL-Au), recirculated through the isolated lung, bound to the endothelial luminal plasma membrane and to features potentially involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis (coated pits, coated vesicles, lysosomelike structures) and in transcytosis (plasmalemmal vesicles). The results suggest that LDL uptake by the lung takes place by both receptor-mediated and receptor-independent mechanisms. Cholesterol may be in part transferred to the lung without the apoprotein moiety; the alveolar capillary endothelium appears to be the first monitor of this complex process.\r"

This is due partly to the variations in the patients' body weight and partly to the restrictions in terms of fine adjustments of dosage imposed by the unitary content of active principle in the available individual preparations of the drugs. The availability of a fixed-triple combination of the same 3 drugs where the content of each component is established multiplying the mg/kg requirement of each drug by 10, allows a complete coincidence between the appropriate and the administered dose simply administering 1 tablet every 10 kg of body weight. The implications of the large overdosing in light patients if the conventional approach is followed are discussed in terms of toxicity and drug purchasing cost, both being of great relevance for Third World countries where the majority of patients are of low body weight.\r"

The drug was equally ineffective against these bacteria within cultured normal human macrophages. We conclude that the pyrazinamidase test is not suitable for susceptibility studies against M. avium complex. On the basis of our in vitro studies, which support earlier data, we believe that PZA is not appropriate for therapy of MAC disease.\r"

In order to examine the relationship of renal circulatory alterations and cellular dysfunction in murine sepsis, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), renal tissue metabolites, and energy charge ratios were determined in Sprague-Dawley rats at 10 and 20 hours following induction of peritonitis by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) or cecal manipulation alone (sham). Tissue levels of adenine nucleotides, lactate, and pyruvate were assayed after freeze-clamping kidneys unilaterally followed by enzymatic determinations. Cardiac outputs were determined by thermodilution and ERPF by p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) clearance. Results indicate in this model, despite an increase in cardiac output (P less than 0.05), ERPF was significantly decreased at both 10 hours (P less than; 0.05) and 20 hours (P less than 0.01) following induction of peritonitis. Further, although tissue pyruvate/lactate ratios showed significant decreases by 10 hours (P less than 0.05), diminished energy charge ratios were not observed until 20 hours following septic insult. These findings support the hypothesis of diminished renal perfusion as contributory and antecedent to cellular dysfunction in septicemic ARF.\r"

  ".W": "The collateral circulation in the rat small intestine was studied by evaluating the viability of an intestinal segment after its primary mesenteric vascular supply had been interrupted. After ligation of the main mesenteric branches of a 30-cm segment of either jejunum or ileum, viability was assessed immediately by the fluorescence pattern observed under ultraviolet illumination after the peripheral intravenous injection of sodium fluorescein. Viability was assessed again at 48 hours by the fluorescein technique and by gross and histologic examination. With the marginal vessels intact, the collateral circulation was able to sustain 10 per cent of the entire length of small intestine beyond the point of devascularization. On the other hand, when the marginal vessels had been ligated, this length of sustained intestine proved to be negligible. With respect to the above findings, there was no difference in the extent or pattern of collateral circulation at different levels along the small intestine, from proximal jejunum to jejuno-ileal junction to terminal ileum. Systemic infusion of a vasodilator, isoproterenol, was found to substantially decrease the length of small intestine maintained viable by collateral flow. This was associated with a greater decrease in systemic vascular resistance than in mesenteric vascular resistance, which resulted in a drop in mesenteric blood flow. In each of the above studies, the ultimate viability of the intestine by histologic section at 48 hours correlated closely with the fluorescein pattern immediately after devascularization. These studies demonstrate that the collateral circulation of the small intestine is extensive and sufficient to maintain viability in a substantial proportion of the length of the entire intestine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Individuals were placed on a tilt table and cardiac profiles (measurements of CO, SV, EDV, and ESV) were performed at 45 degrees head up, 15 degrees head up, and supine. Group 1 responded by increasing CI from 2.9 +/- 0.81 L/min/M2 at 45 degrees to 3.3 +/- 1.0 L/min/M2 at 15 degrees to 3.7 +/- 1.0 L/min/M2 supine. There was no corresponding rise seen in group 2, with CIs of 2.1 +/- 0.83 L/min/M2, 2.0 +/- 0.78 L/min/M2 and 2.0 +/- 0.76 L/min/M2 at each position, respectively.

The inability of group 2 patients to elevate CI and the absence of any discernible change in EDV suggests an insufficiency of cardiac reserve with noncompliant ventricles.

  ".W": "Of the 12,000 fire-related deaths occurring annually in the United States, it is estimated that 60 to 80 per cent are due to smoke inhalation. Plastic and synthetic materials which have been introduced in home construction and furnishings produce a more toxic smoke when burned. Efforts to identify a \"supertoxin\" in this smoke have been unsuccessful to date. An alternative approach is to examine why victims are unable to escape, and become exposed to smoke for lethal periods of time. The authors examined the circumstances of death in 39 fire victims (27 adults, 12 children) over a 25-month period. Detailed examination of the fire scene, autopsy studies, and toxicologic analysis were carried out. Position of the victim, and escape efforts were noted. Carbon monoxide was elevated in all victims, with \"lethal\" levels (= greater than 50%) in 21/39 victims. Cyanide was detected in 24/29 victims, but none had lethal (3 mg/L) levels present. Ethanol was detected in 21/26 adults (80%) and 0/12 children (0%). 18/26 adult victims had ethanol levels above the statutory level of intoxication (10 mg%). Victims found in bed (no escape attempt) had a mean blood ethanol level of 268 mg%, compared with a mean level of 88 mg% in those victims found near an exit (P = .006). Ethanol intoxication significantly impairs the ability to escape from fire and smoke and is a contributory factor in smoke-related mortality.\r"

The PSF, obtained using a continuous-wave (CW) Doppler velocimeter, has been used more frequently, however, in the quantitation of carotid occlusive disease. The authors have employed a microprocessor-driven pulsatile flow model to evaluate more completely the relationship between stenosis and the %SW. Using an 8 MHz CW Doppler probe, the Doppler-shifted frequencies were recorded at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 diameters distal to a variable, nonaxisymmetric stenosis, which reduced the cross-sectional area (CSA) 25, 40, 50, 60, 70, 85, and 97 per cent. Four sets of observations were made and the %SW derived using a spectrum analyzer. At one diameter from the stenosis, the relationship between the %SW (Y) and the reduction in CSA (X) is best described by two first-order regressions (Y = MX + B). The slope of the relationship from 0 to 60 per cent reduction in CSA is nearly flat, -0.052, while there is a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in the slope, -1.538, when the CSA is further reduced from 60 to 97 per cent. Beyond 1 diameter, the relationship is best described by a single linear regression, the gradual slope of which does not permit clinically useful comparisons. These data explain the lack of strong correlation between CSA and %SW when the data are evaluated over the entire range of stenoses. However, they do indicate that the %SW may be a useful correlate if it is obtained within one diameter of the stenosis.\r"

Two types of studies have evolved: acute--to define the acute renal injury and chronic--to determine the pattern of recovery. Current models allow either study alone to be performed, but they lack the flexibility to combine the studies. In this study of renal ischemia, a model was designed which solved this problem. The authors constructed a model for performing a unilateral nephrectomy and episiotomy on female dogs. Catheters were placed in the renal vein, vena cava, and aorta, and a renal artery flow cuff was applied. The catheters and wires were buried in a subcutaneous pocket and were exteriorized after a recovery of several weeks. The episiotomy allowed easy intermittent Foley catheterization. With the animals awake and in a harness, parameters of renal function were measured: renal extraction, filtration fraction, fractional excretion, osmolar clearance, and free water clearance. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were calculated by inulin and paramino hippurate clearances. The animals were studied in diuretic and antidiuretic states. In addition, renal artery flow was determined by the Doppler flow cuff. All parameters were determined every half hour in the acute setting, then every day in the chronic setting. The model was easily reproducible and functioned well in the authors' renal ischemia studies. Initial experiments with 1 hour of warm ischemia produced a greater than 50 per cent reduction in GFR acutely. Chronic studies showed a GFR with a return toward normal. All model construction purposes and plans were met.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Serial histologic observations of the healing process of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular grafts in dogs were performed. The common iliac arteries of 12 mongrel dogs were replaced with a 2-cm segment of 6 mm PTFE graft, bilaterally. The grafts were studied microscopically after the animals were killed at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks. All the grafts remained patent up to 24 weeks. Special attention was paid to the histological characteristics of pannus growth, which were divided into two types: smooth appearing and irregular. The former type was characterized by smooth, thinner connective tissue growth along the graft, and the latter was defined as irregular-shaped pannus containing large and small thrombi. Only pannus of the smooth type showed similar growth patterns and growth rates. These findings suggest essentially that pannus develops smoothly from both ends of the graft; however, thrombi disturbed this growth pattern. In 24 grafts, eight nodular lesions of the pannus (greater than 500 mu in height) were found: five distally and three proximally. All eight lesions were found within 3 mm of the anastomoses. Among these eight lesions, five were on the completely healed pannus, and the remainings were all on the irregular pannus. This suggests that thrombi organization followed by nodular lesions are major offending factors that lead to the formation of intimal hyperplasia.\r"

The two syndromes appeared simultaneously in four patients, suggesting a common biologic process, and in the others the immunodeficiency either preceded or followed the arthritis. Reiter's syndrome occurring in the setting of this profound immunodeficiency suggests that helper T cells were not involved in the pathogenesis of the rheumatic disease. Difficulties were encountered in the diagnosis of either syndrome in the presence of the other. Two patients with Reiter's syndrome developed Kaposi's sarcoma and fulminant AIDS after receiving methotrexate, which emphasizes the need for caution in the use of immunosuppressive therapy in Reiter's syndrome. An additional patient with undifferentiated spondylarthropathy subsequently developed psoriasis in conjunction with the onset of AIDS.\r"

Two patients had rectal mucosal inflammation but sparing of the distal colon from subepithelial collagen. Other findings included thyroid disease (four patients), urethral fibrosis (three), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (six), and eosinophilia (three). The colon was thought to be the main source of diarrheal fluid, but bile salt malabsorption, steatorrhea, and net small-bowel secretion were additive factors in some patients. With antiinflammatory treatment the diarrhea abated, the surface epithelial injury decreased, and the subepithelial collagen resolved (two patients), but lamina propria inflammation persisted. Collagenous colitis seems to be a chronic systemic, and perhaps autoimmune, disorder.\r"

To evaluate the mechanisms of hyperamylasemia, we measured amylase, lipase, and isoamylase activity in 17 consecutive patients admitted to the eating disorder unit. Six patients had elevated amylase activity, and 5 of these 6 had isolated increases in salivary isoamylase activity. Six other patients had normal serum total amylase activity but modest elevations in the salivary isoamylase fraction. No patient developed clinical evidence of pancreatitis during hospitalization. Thus, the hyperamylasemia in patients with anorexia and bulimia often is caused by increased salivary-type amylase activity. The appropriate diagnostic test for hyperamylasemia in patients with anorexia or bulimia is the simple measurement of serum lipase or pancreatic isoamylase activity. If these levels are found to be normal, further tests to exclude pancreatitis are unnecessary.\r"

Exercise ST changes were classified as elevation or depression and by lead groups involved. The ST depression occurred most commonly in leads V5 or V6 regardless of which coronary artery was involved. In contrast, anterior ST elevation indicated left anterior descending coronary disease in 93% of cases, and inferior ST elevation indicated a lesion in or proximal to the posterior descending artery in 86% of cases. Furthermore, anterior ST elevation in leads without diagnostic Q waves usually indicated a high-grade, often proximal, left anterior descending stenosis, whereas anterior ST elevation in leads with Q waves usually indicated a totally occluded left anterior descending coronary artery. Thus, ST elevation during exercise testing, although uncommon, is a reliable guide to the underlying coronary lesion, whereas ST depression is not.\r"

Accumulations of immune complexes and lymphoid cells in several locations within the kidney are the best-described elements of lupus nephritis. The extreme diversity of the renal changes indicates that many variables are likely to be involved. Inbred strains of lupus-prone mice have provided homogeneous subjects for study of pathogenesis and response to treatment. Comparable grouping of lupus nephritis in humans according to unique or dominant pathogenetic mechanisms is imprecise and limited by insufficient knowledge of the primary stimulus for the disease. Treatment is also imperfect and, at times, hazardous. Certain regimens incorporating cytotoxic drugs provide a significant therapeutic advantage over corticosteroids alone in the management of this disease.\r"

This paper outlines our surgical techniques, which have been tempered and modified to an anesthetic technique that provides the greatest safety with comfort. We detail the basic anesthetic methods for drug usage, pulmonary ventilation, and patient monitoring that we now use. A careful analysis of our results is presented to show that this technique does provide relatively safe anesthesia in this difficult setting.\r"

We have found this technique to be an expeditious and highly successful means of eradicating T1 or T2 glottic cancer. The use of the patient's own full-thickness, adjacent normal tissue with imbrication of cartilage produces an adequate airway, an almost normal-appearing larynx, and a remarkable posttreatment voice quality, better results than from most cordectomies or vertical hemilaryngectomies. It is valuable as a salvage procedure after full-course radiation. Imbrication laryngoplasty is an alternative and a preferred modality for treatment of young people with early glottic carcinoma for whom the possible carcinogenic properties of radiation must be considered. The survival results are comparable with the more extensive vertical laryngectomies.\r"

The structure surrounding the posterior glottis was histologically investigated in the same three conditions. The results are as follows. The structure surrounding the posterior glottis consists of three portions: the posterior wall of the glottis, the lateral wall of the posterior glottis, and the cartilaginous portion of the vocal fold. During vocal fold adduction, the posterior part of the larynx closes completely not at the glottis but at the supraglottis, resulting in formation of a conic space in the posterior glottis that can be viewed only from below. The posterior glottis accounts for approximately 35% to 45% of the entire glottic length and 50% to 65% of the entire glottic area. The mucosa of the posterior glottis has ciliated epithelium. The lamina propria consists of two layers. The posterior glottis can be regarded as a respiratory glottis.\r"

Nine patients had postintubation stricture, eight had blunt trauma with cricotracheal disruption, seven had a neoplasm, two had an inhalation burn, and two had idiopathic stenosis. In all cases, the anterior cricoid arch was completely resected and a submucosal segment of the posterior cricoid plate was partially resected. A posterior shell of cricoid plate was preserved in 21 patients with intact laryngeal nerve function. Postoperatively, a Montgomery T-tube was used to stent the anastomosis and subglottic area in ten patients, all of whom had residual injury or disease at or immediately below the level of the cords. The proximal arm of the T-tube was positioned above the vocal cords. The tube was removed within 1 month in eight patients and remained for 3 and 18 months in the other two. The extent of resection varied from 2.5 to 7 cm. Tension-relieving procedures were added in 13 cases. Fourteen patients have been followed longer than 5 years, and five patients for more than 10 years. A widely patent anastomosis was maintained in 26 patients. In two patients, a partial restenosis resulted in some limitations of exercise tolerance. Voice and exercise tolerance have not deteriorated with the passage of time. Recurrent laryngeal nerve function was completely preserved in 20 of the 21 patients whose nerve function was intact before operation.\r"

The first case of this lesion was observed in Canada in 1972. Fourteen cases of small cell carcinoma of the larynx were observed in the Ear, Nose, and Throat Department of Padua University in a series of 3,284 primary and secondary laryngeal and hypopharyngeal malignant neoplasms. This number constitutes the largest collection from a single institution in the literature and brings the total recorded cases to 66. The tumor is thought to arise from the argyrophilic Kulchitsky cells normally found in laryngeal mucosa. The diagnosis is based on the light microscopic appearance of the neoplasm and can be confirmed by electron microscopy. The differential diagnosis must be made from carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, small cell squamous carcinoma, small cell ductal carcinoma, lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, and metastatic lung small cell cancer. Systemic chemotherapy with radiation therapy is the accepted manner of treatment today. The survival of the patients treated with these modalities may be significantly improved, and some patients may be cured.\r"

Three significant findings were felt to be derived from this study. One, surface epithelium of the larynx had essentially no estrogen-receptor activity. Two, all tissues of mesenchymal origin, especially lamina propria, muscle, dense connective tissue, and fat had consistently high levels of nuclear localization of the labeled estrogen. The binding affinity seemed to be the highest at the anterior commissure and the immediate anterior subglottic space. Three, there was a high level of receptor binding in laryngeal cartilage and perichondrium. Since the activated hormone-receptor complex modulates gene expression to alter the amount of mRNA, sex steroids have a direct regulatory effect upon the target cell and, perhaps through an induction process, can exert an indirect effect upon adjacent tissues. It is postulated that since the larynx is a sexually dimorphic organ, the sex steroids and their receptors may play a role in altered phonation during aging and possibly in the development of laryngeal neoplasms and other diseases. Therefore, hormonal manipulation may play a future role in the therapy of laryngeal diseases. This study represents the first demonstration of estrogen receptors by specific anatomic location in the primate larynx with significant localization in the mesenchymal tissues but not in the epithelial tissues.\r"

Because even unilateral vocal cord paralysis can result in severe respiratory distress in the newborn and in small children, recognition of this problem can be critical. A logical approach to diagnosis and management requires not only that the physician be alert to the problem but also that several procedures be established that can be used together or singly to address the problem, as is most appropriate to the individual case. The usefulness of intubation, tracheotomy, surgical lateralization of the vocal folds, and reinnervation in the management of these problems is discussed, and 30 cases of vocal cord paralysis in children under the age of 5 years are presented.\r"

  ".W": "Endotracheal intubation has proven to be a relatively safe and effective means of securing the airway in neonates. Some concern remains, however, regarding airway management in critically ill infants who require assisted ventilation for extended periods. Among the various risk factors associated with the complication of acquired subglottic stenosis in neonates, the one most frequently cited has been \"prolonged\" intubation, although opinion varies regarding the definition of this term. Various recommendations exist that attempt to establish the limits of \"safe\" periods of intubation for infants. Some feel that tracheotomy is indicated when airway support is required beyond those limits. In an attempt to define important risk factors involved in the development of neonatal subglottic stenosis, a retrospective analysis of infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Columbus Children's Hospital who required intubation during a 3-year period from 1977 to 1980 was undertaken. Of 343 infants who survived hospitalization, five patients were identified as having acquired subglottic stenosis. The average duration of intubation for these five patients was 56.2 days. The incidence of subglottic stenosis for infants whose duration of intubation ranged from 3 to 50 days was 0.4% (1/245). Infants with birth weights less than 1,500 g appeared more susceptible to the development of intubation-related laryngeal injury. The conclusion of this study is that endotracheal intubation is an appropriate means of long-term airway management in neonates hospitalized in a pediatric intensive care unit, providing other known risk factors are minimized.\r"

Anesthesia with hypotension is important to improve the results. To facilitate focusing, a balanced movable position of the microscope directed by head motions of the surgeon and a semi-Fowler's position for the patient have proven best. Large fenestrations above and below the lower turbinates permit maxillary sinus surgery under direct binocular vision with the aid of mirrors or endoscopes. For the last 12 years the Caldwell-Luc approach was used in less than 2% of operations. All ethmoidal, lacrimal sac, and epistaxis surgery is performed intranasally. In 1984 frontal sinus surgery was performed in 59 cases with an intranasal and in 11 cases with an osteoplastic procedure. For a larger defect of the ethmoidal roof in severe injuries, conically trimmed rib cartilage is wedged into the defect from above. Having performed more than 4,000 ethmoidal operations we have never experienced an iatrogenic CSF leakage, or persisting postoperative visual or ocular disturbance. In order to achieve the necessary skill, training on 50 cadavers is required.\r"

After 8 weeks, five of eight ears had middle ear effusions, and four of these had cholesteatomas; one ear had total atelectasis with a cholesteatoma filling the bulla. By 16 weeks, six of eight ears had developed cholesteatomas. Some animals did not develop effusion or retraction because of failure or recanalization of eustachian tube obstruction.

Latencies were significantly prolonged and peak velocities reduced only when the timing of target motion was unpredictable. Saccades to predictable amplitude targets were abnormally hypometric. In 8 patients, impersistence of gaze was manifested by large-amplitude saccadic intrusions away from the intended position of gaze. When instructed to make saccades away from a flashed target, patients made reflexive saccades toward the target. We attribute this visual grasp reflex to frontal lobe degeneration.

It is the principal source of cortical input to the hippocampal formation. In 11 cases of Alzheimer's disease, we have found that neurofibrillary tangles develop in the cells of origin of the perforant pathway. In addition, the termination zone of the perforant pathway, in the outer two thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, contains a distinct layer of neuritic plaques. None of the 8 control subjects had such changes. These profound alterations effectively disconnect the hippocampal formation from the association and limbic cortices. Because of the central role of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus in learning, it is likely that pathological changes in the perforant pathway, by precluding normal hippocampal operation, account for some aspects of the memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

All major cortical and subcortical regions were examined. Widespread reductions of SLI in Alzheimer's disease cerebral cortex were found, with the most profound changes seen in temporal lobe; but there also were major reductions in both the frontal and occipital cortex. There were no significant reductions in subcortical regions. Characterization of SLI by high-pressure liquid chromatography showed no significant difference in profiles between Alzheimer's disease and control frontal cortex. These results suggest that the reduction in somatostatin immunoreactivity in Alzheimer's disease may be caused by degeneration of intrinsic somatostatin cortical neurons.\r"

The sensitivity of MRI was also greater in patients with infarcts, but the difference between CT and MRI was not as great. Infarcts were usually better delineated by MRI regardless of location. However, MRI failed to reveal cortical infarcts that were clearly seen on contrast-enhanced CT scans and was unable to clearly distinguish subacute from chronic hemorrhagic infarcts. MRI changes were best detected with T2-weighted images and usually appeared as multiple areas of increased signal intensity in the subcortical and periventricular white matter.

Focal seizures caused lateralized decreases in the PCr/Pi ratio; generalized seizures caused bilateral decreases. Postictal spectra had increased PCr/Pi ratios, presumably due to postictal inhibition. Interictal 31P NMR spectra were normal. One patient's seizures were successfully treated with intravenously administered phenobarbital during NMR data acquisition, causing an immediate increase in the PCr/Pi ratio from 0.7 to 1.2. These studies indicate that cerebral PCr concentration decreases by approximately 33% and that oxidative metabolism increases by approximately 45% during neonatal seizures. Five babies had PCr/Pi ratios of less than 0.8 during seizures and subsequently developed long-term neurological sequelae, which suggests that neonatal seizures may cause or exacerbate cerebral injury by increasing cerebral metabolic demands above energy supply.\r"

Camera lucida drawings of Golgi-impregnated neurons were used for examining the following dendritic aspects: dendritic intersections as a function of distance from the cell body, point of maximum dendritic branching, number of branch orders, total number of branch segments, and total dendritic length. The number of intersections and the total dendritic length were above normal in the infantile period (6 months old or less) and dropped steadily to significantly below normal in the juvenile group (older than 2 years). These reductions contrasted with expanding dendritic arborization in normal children. The results suggest that the dendritic tree atrophies in early childhood in Down's syndrome.\r"

Results of electrophysiological studies were consistent with involvement of the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. A thoracic dorsal root ganglion biopsy showed lymphocytic infiltration and degeneration of ganglion cells. We believe that this is the first description of biopsy-documented dorsal root ganglionitis in a subacute sensory neuronopathy associated with Sjogren's syndrome and that the finding suggests an immunopathogenic basis.\r"

Neurological symptoms and signs, cerebrospinal fluid characteristics, and radiographic appearance were reviewed. The clinical and radiographic picture is nonspecific and histological confirmation is essential for diagnosis. Although the tumor appears to be radiosensitive, prognosis is extremely poor, with an average survival of less than two months.\r"

Alterations in the amino acid profile, similar to those described in cancer patients after high-dose methotrexate treatment, were observed in the absence of biochemical evidence of systemic organ toxicity. This model facilitates the study of the biochemical mechanisms of antifolate neurotoxicity in humans and permits the evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions.\r"

Male patients with myotonic dystrophy often have low levels of circulating androgens, and androgen administration has been shown to increase their muscle mass. We have studied the effect of testosterone enanthate administration (3 mg/kg weekly for 3 months) on muscle and whole body protein synthesis in 6 male patients with myotonic dystrophy. Muscle protein synthesis was estimated from the rate of isotope incorporation into muscle protein obtained by quadriceps muscle biopsy during a primed continuous infusion of L-[1-13C]leucine. Testosterone administration resulted in a significant increase in muscle protein synthesis in all patients. Whole body protein synthesis did not increase, indicating that protein synthesis in other tissues may have declined. Muscle ribonucleic acid content rose significantly in response to testosterone administration, suggesting that testosterone initiated its effect by hormone receptor interaction with muscle nuclei.\r"

The cerebral response was averaged from the tone onset (stimulus-synchronized average) and the EMG onset (response-synchronized average). We found that N2 was quite distinct from the other ERP components (P165 and P3) in its lack of a close relationship to the motor response required in a sensory discrimination task. This suggests that, contrary to general belief, the P165-N2-P3 components of the ERP are not generated in an orderly sequence, but rather are generated separately and are possibly related to different cognitive processes.\r"

There were no significant alterations in aspartate, taurine, or alanine levels in any of the regions examined. Widespread significant reductions in cortical GABA concentrations were observed in the Alzheimer's brains, with the largest decreases in the temporal lobe. Overall values for glutamate concentrations in temporal and frontal cortices showed a significant 12% reduction in Alzheimer's brains, but the only individual cortical region showing a significant reduction in glutamate was the inferior temporal gyrus. These results suggest that gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons in Alzheimer's cerebral cortex may be selectively vulnerable to the disease process.\r"

In 206 patients, 28 (14%) experienced incomplete recovery and 178 (86%) had complete recovery, based on evidence in the medical records. Using logistic regression, complete facial weakness, non-ear pain, and hypertension were identified as the most important risk factors for incomplete recovery. Patients were divided into two groups for comparison of treatment results; one group (n = 94) was without any of the three identified risk factors, and the other group (n = 112) consisted of patients who had one or more risk factors. Results suggested that among the latter group, those treated with steroids fared better than those in any of the other treatment groups.\r"

Eighteen patients had similar MRI and EP results (e.g., normal or multiple abnormalities), 8 had multiple abnormalities shown by MRI but normal or single-modality abnormal EPs, and 1 had multiple abnormal EPs but a normal MRI scan. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity of the two techniques in detecting multiple lesions in the patients with definite MS, whereas among those with probable MS, MRI had a significantly higher yield. Seventeen patients showed clinical evidence of posterior fossa involvement, 6 patients had abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs), and 4 patients had areas of increased signal intensity revealed by MRI of the brainstem. There was no clinical evidence of brainstem involvement in 2 patients with BAEP abnormalities, 2 with an abnormal posterior fossa shown by MRI, and one patient with abnormalities shown by both BAEP and MRI. We conclude that MRI is more sensitive in detecting multiple lesions than are multimodality EP studies, but that BAEP assessment may be slightly more sensitive than MRI in detecting brainstem lesions.\r"

Microbiologic samples of hand flora were obtained at base line and after hand washes 1 and 15 on test days 1 and 5. After the initial hand wash there were significant reductions over base line in aerobic and anaerobic log CFU among those using Alc A, CHG, and IPA. By the end of the first day of hand washing (15 washes), there were 2-log or greater reductions in aerobic counts among subjects using all antiseptics, but no significant reductions in controls. By the end of day 5, all agents produced significant reductions in aerobic (P = 0.0002) and anaerobic (P = 0.002) counts over control soap. Subject assessment of effects of hand washing on the skin and overall satisfaction varied significantly by product (P = 0.04 and 0.05, respectively).

To determine the in vivo pharmacokinetic significance of these observations, the pharmacokinetics of both total and unbound (non-protein-bound) cefonicid was studied in six volunteers after a single intravenous dose of 30 mg/kg. Saturable serum protein binding was observed in vivo; the mean +/- standard deviation free fraction of cefonicid was 17.6 +/- 6.1% immediately after administration and declined to a constant value of approximately 2% as total serum concentrations fell below 100 micrograms/ml. This nonlinear binding was associated with a pronounced decline in unbound serum cefonicid concentrations during the first 3 h after administration, with low or undetectable unbound drug concentrations by 12 h. Renal clearance of total cefonicid averaged 21.1 ml/min per kg and did not vary with time; in contrast, the mean +/- standard deviation unbound cefonicid renal clearance increased from 5.7 +/- 2.1 to 10.8 +/- 1.6 ml/min per kg with time (P less than 0.02). This study may partially explain the poor results obtained with single daily dosing of cefonicid in endocarditis. Dosage regimens of certain antimicrobial agents with high, saturable serum protein binding and extensive renal tubular secretion may be most appropriately designed based on unbound drug pharmacokinetics.\r"

  ".W": "Norfloxacin has some activity in vitro against Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum, although not at levels attainable in serum. In this study, norfloxacin was administered (400 mg orally twice daily for 10 days) to men with acute nongonococcal urethritis. Of 25 men from whom C. trachomatis was initially isolated, 21 had the organism reisolated at the first follow-up visit posttreatment, and there were minimal changes in the number of inclusion-forming units in culture. Ultimately, all but 1 of the 22 men from whom C. trachomatis was initially isolated and who were monitored became clinical failures within 42 +/- 7 days posttreatment. The clinical outcome was significantly better for men from whom U. urealyticum was initially isolated but from whom C. trachomatis was not isolated. Of 27 men, 17 became and stayed culture negative for U. urealyticum at follow-ups, and clinically, 15 no longer had nongonococcal urethritis. Of these 15, all 12 monitored until at least 42 +/- 7 days posttreatment remained improved. Of 26 men from whom neither C. trachomatis nor U. urealyticum was initially isolated, 18 improved and all 15 who were monitored until at least 42 +/- 7 days posttreatment remained improved. Thus, although norfloxacin attains high levels in urine and has good tissue penetration, it had essentially no activity against chlamydial urethritis in men. It had better, but incomplete, activity against U. urealyticum. For quinolones to show promise in vivo against C. trachomatis, either the MICs will need to be much lower or the levels attained in serum will have to be much higher.\r"

The records of 14,140 of these patients (99.3%) formed the basis for an epidemiologic study of the incidence of skin malignancies in this population. Information about the patients, diagnoses, doses, and sites of treatment was obtained from separate records. The follow-up time was 15 years on the average. We searched the Swedish Cancer Registry, Stockholm, for records reporting the incidence of malignant skin tumors in the study population (incidences of basal cell carcinoma are not registered). The expected number of malignancies was calculated on the basis of age- and sex-standardized incidence data from the Swedish Cancer Registry. In 58 patients, a malignant skin tumor was diagnosed more than five years after grenz-ray therapy had first been administered. Nineteen patients had malignant melanomas, and 39 patients had other malignant skin tumors. The expected number of melanomas was 17.8, and that of other malignant skin tumors was 26.9. None of the patients with melanomas, and only eight of the patients with other malignant skin tumors, had received grenz-ray therapy at the site of the tumor. Six of these eight patients had also been exposed to other known carcinogens. Four hundred eighty-one patients had received an accumulated high dose of grenz rays (greater than or equal to 10 000 rad [greater than or equal to 100 Gy]) on one and the same area. No malignancies were found on those areas. Although we cannot exclude grenz-ray therapy as a risk factor in the development of nonmelanoma skin malignancies, this risk, if any, is small, if recommendations for therapy are followed.\r"

Widespread thrombosis in the subcutaneous vasculature and interstitial bleeding, as observed in a skin biopsy specimen, were consistent with a diagnosis of coumarin necrosis. On two occasions, an acquired functional protein C deficiency was present. It is hypothesized that an imbalance between anticoagulant and procoagulant vitamin K-dependent factors contributed to the pathogenesis of coumarin-induced skin necrosis. This imbalance was related to repeated periods of congestive heart failure.\r"

Over the next 96 hours, the erythema and pain resolved entirely. To date, this is the eighth case of a painful desquamating erythema of the palms and soles occurring as a complication of chemotherapy.

Nodules had been seen for the past ten years and Sjogren's syndrome had accompanied amyloidosis for the last three years. The concomitant occurrence of nodular cutaneous amyloidosis and Sjogren's syndrome may not be by chance, since four of 12 cases of nodular cutaneous amyloidosis that have been reported to date in Japan were in patients with both amyloidosis and Sjogren's syndrome. The amyloid deposits in the tissue were stained with anti-lambda light-chain amyloid antibody. Amyloid fibrils were purified from the skin lesions in this patient and were characterized biochemically, immunologically, and ultrastructurally. The results indicated that the amyloid fibrils consisted of 29,000-, 20,000-, and 17,000- dalton peptides, the 29,000-dalton peptide of which was shown to react with the lambda light chain of immunoglobulin by immunoblot study.\r"

Scalloped bony deformities of the distal phalanges of both hands were noted on roentgenograms. The origin of these lytic deformities is uncertain; they may be secondary pressure phenomena or, alternatively, they may be an intrinsic manifestation of incontinentia pigmenti. These subungual tumors clinically resemble verrucae, keratoacanthomas, squamous cell carcinomas, or subungual fibromas. Therefore, it is important to recognize that subungual keratotic tumors may be a late manifestation of incontinentia pigmenti.\r"

During upper respiratory infection, the main abnormality detected was brief (greater than 3 less than 6 seconds) or prolonged (greater than 6 seconds) attacks of obstructive apnoea. Other indices of apnoea were similar to recovery data. Gross body movements were also increased. In infants with metabolic alkalosis indices of central apnoea were significantly increased when compared with recovery or case control data. Prolonged (greater than 15 seconds) attacks of central apnoea and obstructive apnoea (greater than 6 seconds) were only observed during illness. Gross body movements and periodic breathing were also increased. These findings suggest that the functional consequences of apparently 'mild' illnesses in young infants may be greater than is generally suspected and perhaps relevant to mechanism(s) of death in sudden infant death syndrome.\r"

The 145 infants were either breast fed or fed one of two milk formulas supplying copper at different concentrations. None of the infants achieved the minimum copper intakes recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). At 2 months of age there were no major differences in growth or health detected in infants fed the different copper intakes. Infant birth weight correlated well with the ratio of maternal venous plasma zinc:maternal leucocyte zinc at delivery. Maternal venous plasma copper and zinc concentrations at birth correlated with umbilical venous plasma copper and zinc concentrations. Infants fed the higher copper content formulas had a low mean plasma zinc concentration without a significant increase in the mean plasma copper concentration. The present WHO recommendations regarding minimum copper intakes for infants fed formulas cannot be achieved with currently available formulas and are probably wrong.\r"

In six severely asphyxiated babies the electroencephalograph (EEG) and blood pressure were monitored continuously. Thiopentone was infused at a rate sufficient to suppress completely the EEG providing the mean blood pressure remained above 35 mm Hg; it was continued until there was no evidence of cerebral oedema for 24 hours. In two the infusion was stopped prematurely because of hypotension that was unresponsive to treatment. In the other four a deep coma was maintained for a median duration of 127 hours. All developed pharmacodynamic tolerance to the thiopentone and showed non-linear elimination kinetics. Three babies died; the three survivors have moderate to severe handicap. It was concluded that with full intensive care it is possible to induce a deep coma; the outcome does not seem to be improved, however, and the incidence of complications was high.\r"

They were grouped according to real time ultrasound scans in the neonatal period: infants in group A (n = 20) had periventricular haemorrhage (PVH) and normal ventricles; infants in group B (n = 26) had PVH and dilated ventricles (none with clinical hydrocephalus); and infants in group C, who formed the control group (n = 52), had no PVH and normal ventricles. At outpatient follow up a static image ultrasound scanner was used to measure the width of the lateral ventricles and brain hemispheres. The three groups of infants showed similar growth in occipitofrontal circumference, biparietal diameter, and brain hemispheres irrespective of a history of PVH or ventricular dilatation. The relation of ventricle size to biparietal diameter was similar in those infants in groups A (PVH alone) and C (controls) who had a good outcome. About a third (n = 8) of the infants in group B had persistent ventricular dilatation in relation to biparietal diameter and a poor outcome associated with developmental delay and cerebral palsy. By contrast, the remaining two thirds (n = 18) of the infants in group B who later had smaller ventricles in relation to biparietal diameter showed fewer neurodevelopmental sequelae. It is suggested that persistent ventricular dilatation in relation to biparietal diameter at follow up carries a bad prognosis, which might be due to brain atrophy.\r"

To confirm one of these findings we studied the clearance of chloramphenicol and its metabolites using high pressure liquid chromatography in five patients (ages 2.5 to 5 years) before and during oral treatment with acetaminophen (50 mg/kg/day). Significant differences were observed in mean (SD) peak serum chloramphenicol concentration (-9.7 (3.2) mg/l), mean (SD) apparent volume of distribution (+225 (162) ml/kg), mean (SD) chloramphenicol half life (-1.9 (1.1) hours), mean (SD) chloramphenicol clearance (+236 (94) ml/kg/h), mean (SD) area under the curve (-83.5 (33.0) mg/l/h), and mean (SD) elimination constant (+0.34 (0.13) h-1) between samples obtained before and during treatment with acetaminophen. Acetaminophen, when given orally for several days, increased the clearance of chloramphenicol, perhaps by increased glucuronidation. This report re-emphasises the need for therapeutic drug monitoring whenever these two drugs are used together.\r"
