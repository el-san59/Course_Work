No evidence of space-time clustering of dates and places of onset was found for these cases. Two age- and sex-matched controls were selected for 72 of the 122 cases diagnosed in the period 1980-84 and life histories of places of residence were obtained for these cases and the controls. No evidence was found that cases had lived closer to each other than had controls at any time in their lives, except that there was an excess of cases born in London. The study does not provide supportive evidence for case-to-case transmission of CJD being an important component in the aetiology of the disease.\r"

Computed Tomography (CT) showed a mass lesion at the site of the previous abnormality typical of radiation necrosis, but with features identical to those of a malignant neoplasm. Biopsy confirmed cerebral radiation necrosis. The radiation dose was 25 Gray to the periphery of two overlapping 14 mm collimator fields, delivered in a single dose. Treatment with steroids led to improvement in the symptoms and signs of raised intracranial pressure, but not the focal deficit. Radiation necrosis is a consequence of the large doses required to obliterate AVMs and is a limiting factor in their treatment. It is important for clinicians referring patients for stereotactic radiosurgery to be aware of this complication, and to be able to recognise and treat it.\r"

  ".W": "A multicenter study used 756 samples from 251 patients in 12 institutions to compare arterial (PaO2, PaCO2) with transcutaneous (PsO2, PsCO2) oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, measured usually at 44 degrees C. Of these samples, 336 were obtained from 116 neonates, 27 from 25 children with cystic fibrosis, and 140 from 40 patients under general anesthesia. Ninety-one patients were between 4 weeks and 18 years of age, 32 were between 18 and 60 years, and 12 were over 60. The ratio of transcutaneous to arterial P(s/a)CO2 was 1.01 +/- 0.11 with PaCO2 less than 30 mm Hg, increasing to 1.04 +/- 0.08 at PaCO2 greater than 40 mm Hg. Mean bias and its standard deviation (PsCO2 - PaCO2) were + 1.3 +/- 3.9 mm Hg in the entire group, + 1.8 +/- 4.2 mm Hg in neonates (NS). Bias was + 0.2 +/- 2.7 mm Hg when PaCO2 was less than 30 mm Hg (N = 175, NS), 1.0 +/- 3.4 with 30 less than PaCO2 less than 40 (n = 329, p less than 0.001), and + 2.04 +/- 4.00 mm Hg with 40 less than PaCO2 less than 70 (n = 229, p less than 0.001). These data suggest that, using transcutaneous PCO2 monitors with inbuilt temperature correction of 4.5%/degrees C, the skin metabolic offset should be set to 6 mm Hg. The linear regression was PsCO2 = 1.052(PaCO2) - 0.56, Sy.x = 3.92, R = 0.929 (n = 756); and PsCO2 = 1.09(PaCO2) - 1.57, Sy.x = 4.17, R = 0.928 in neonates (n = 336).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Between November 1, 1983 and June 30, 1987, 510 node-positive, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients have been randomly allocated to receive either chemotherapy (six intravenous [IV] cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil [CMF] courses followed by four IV epirubicin courses) or 5 years of tamoxifen treatment or a combination of both therapies. After a median follow-up of 40 months, patients receiving the combined treatment achieved the best results, and those treated with chemotherapy alone achieved the worst, the difference being particularly evident in postmenopausal women. However, while the concurrent use of chemotherapy and tamoxifen did improve the results achieved by chemotherapy alone, particularly in postmenopausal women and in those with four or more involved nodes, it did not significantly improve the results achieved by tamoxifen alone, particularly in patients with higher ER tumor concentrations. Side effects were more numerous and more severe in patients receiving chemotherapy (with or without tamoxifen). Our findings, although still preliminary, confirm that tamoxifen should be the treatment of choice for postmenopausal breast cancer patients with node-positive, ER-positive tumors. In addition, the findings suggest that tamoxifen may represent a safe alternative to chemotherapy (at least to the cytotoxic regimen we used) for younger women, provided they have ER-positive tumors. In patients with ER-positive tumors, the addition of chemotherapy to tamoxifen does not seem to improve significantly the effectiveness of tamoxifen alone.\r"

  ".W": "Six hundred forty-six women with node-positive breast cancer from two prospective, randomized, adjuvant breast cancer trials were evaluated for changes in weight during and after receiving 60 weeks of chemotherapy, chemohormonal therapy, or observation. The median weight change in the 545 patients remaining on protocol at 60 weeks for observed postmenopausal patients was +1.8 kg, for treated postmenopausal patients +3.6 kg, and for treated premenopausal patients +5.9 kg (P less than .001). After a median follow-up of 6.6 years, premenopausal women who gained more than the median weight at 60 weeks had a risk of relapse 1.5 times greater (covariate P = .17) and a risk of death 1.6 times greater (covariate P = .04) than premenopausal women who had gained less than the median weight. In the postmenopausal patients, the trend for inferior relapse-free and overall survival in those who gained more than the median weight at 60 weeks was not significant (P = .05). We conclude that, relative to observation, adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with greater weight gain in node-positive, postmenopausal breast cancer patients; the amount of weight gain appears greater for premenopausal than postmenopausal women, and in premenopausal women, excessive weight gain may be associated with an increase in relapse and cancer-related deaths in the selected patients who show no evidence of recurrence during 60 weeks of adjuvant chemotherapy. This last point must be interpreted with caution because of the exploratory nature of the analyses.\r"

  ".W": "From August 1985 to November 1989 we conducted a trial of intraperitoneal (IP) carboplatin including a dose-escalation design in 25 women with advanced gynecologic malignancies. All had extensive prior therapy with cisplatin (median cumulative dose, 525 mg/m2). Carboplatin was administered IP in 2 L of 1.5% dextrose with a 4-hour dwell time every 4 weeks for six cycles at a starting dose of 200 mg/m2. Patients with reduced creatinine clearance (30 to 60 cc/min) were escalated more slowly than those with high (greater than 60 cc/min) clearance. Thrombocytopenia was dose-limiting and often more severe in patients with compromised renal function; there was no local drug toxicity. The median time of follow-up is 25 months. Complete responses (CRs) were documented in six of 23 assessable patients (26%) by repeat laparotomy, and an additional 11 patients (48%) had no disease evident by noninvasive restaging. Five of the CRs and six of the patients with no clinically evident disease have relapsed from 3 to 40 months after therapy. Six patients (26%) are alive and free of disease 8 to 47 (median, 20) months after therapy. IP carboplatin is effective against relapsed ovarian cancer, even after prior cisplatin therapy.\r"

Twenty-seven patients (26 stage IV) were treated with concurrent standard radiotherapy and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 and every 3 weeks for three courses. In 24 (89%) patients, complete response (CR) was achieved. The CR rate was higher for poorly undifferentiated cancer (100%). The major side effects were leukopenia (97%), anemia (54%), nausea and vomiting (81%), stomatitis (92%), and renal impairment (52%). Most of these side effects were either mild or moderate and reversible. All patients finished the radiotherapy dose (greater than 6,450 cGy), 19 (70%) had three courses of cisplatin, and eight had only two courses, six due to drug toxicity. Twenty-six patients with stage IV disease were compared with 78 patients treated with radiotherapy alone by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). The disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival, and the incidence of distant organ metastasis appear to be better in the combined group. It was concluded that the combination of chemo-radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced NPC needs to be evaluated in a phase III randomized trial.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-six patients with operable epidermoid cancer of the esophagus were entered into a phase III, random assignment study designed to compare the efficacy of two preoperative approaches (chemotherapy [CT] or radiation therapy [RT]). Major study end points were objective response rates, surgical outcome, and recurrence pattern. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either two cycles of cisplatin, vindesine, and bleomycin or 55 Gy of radiation before a planned surgical procedure. Postoperative crossover therapy (radiation to those receiving preoperative CT and vice versa) was given to patients with T3Nany or unresectable tumors. Objective response rates of the primary tumor to preoperative therapy were similar (RT 64%, CT 55%), as were operability rates (RT 77%, CT 75%), resection rates (RT 65%, CT 58%), and operative mortality (RT 13.5%, CT 11.1%). Significantly higher doses of CT could be administered when CT was given as initial therapy, rather than after RT/surgery. Local failure or persistence occurred in 33% of operable patients. The median survival for all patients was 11 months; 20% remain alive without disease (median follow-up, 34 months). Because of the crossover design, it was not possible to analyze survival according to the preoperative therapy arm alone. This study suggests that since CT is as effective in treating local tumor as RT, but can also potentially treat systemic disease, investigational programs using CT before surgery as part of initial treatment for localized esophageal cancer should continue. However, if a significant impact on overall survival is to be achieved, more effective chemotherapy regimens or schedules need to be identified. Outside of carefully designed clinical trials, surgery alone or radiation alone remain standard therapy.\r"

After excluding ineligible patients, 281 patients are included in this analysis. Treatment was moderately well tolerated by the majority of patients, the common side effects being nausea and vomiting (58%) and alopecia (57%). Three possible treatment-related deaths were seen, all due to cardiac failure. At median follow-up of 68 months, 164 patients have died, 73 in the treated arm and 91 in the control arm. There was no significant difference in disease-free or overall survival between the two arms of the study (P = 0.21). There is some evidence that patients with more advanced carcinoma (T3-T4) derived some benefit from treatment (P = 0.04). The interpretation of this finding must take into account that all subgroups were defined retrospectively, and this could, therefore, be a chance finding. We conclude that adjuvant chemotherapy as given in this trial is not indicated as routine treatment in operable gastric cancer, but that further evaluation in stage T3-T4 patients is warranted.\r"

Ninety-two cases (49%) were large noncleaved-cell lymphoma (LNCCL), 61 cases (33%) were large-cleaved-cell lymphoma (LCCL), 17 cases (9%) were peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and 16 cases (9%) were immunoblastic sarcoma of B cells (IBS-B). These subsets of large-cell lymphoma did not differ with respect to median age, distribution by stage, or incidence of bone marrow involvement. Significant differences between groups were noted with regard to male:female ratio, incidence of symptoms, incidence of extranodal disease, and pattern of adenopathy. However, when LCCL was excluded from the analysis, none of these differences were significant. By univariate analysis, age, stage, marrow involvement, extranodal disease, B symptoms, elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and diffuse pattern were unfavorable prognostic features in large-cell lymphoma. However, when cases were stratified by cell of origin, nodular versus diffuse pattern was of no prognostic significance. Nodularity was favorable only because 71% of nodular and nodular-diffuse cases were LCCL, while the majority of diffuse cases were LNCCL. Although IBS-B is considered a \"high-grade\" lymphoma, we found no evidence for inferior survival in these patients compared with LNCCL or LCCL. In fact, survival was better in IBS-B than in LNCCL or LCCL, although this difference was not significant. However, survival was significantly inferior in PTCL (median, 11 months) compared with the other subsets of large-cell lymphoma (median, 46 months; P = .038, log-rank test). Since the association of PTCL and an inferior survival has most often been noted in the context of \"second-generation\" chemotherapy, we believe that this association may be therapy-dependent and may be minimized by the use of more aggressive chemotherapy regimens.\r"

While the pathogenesis of these disorders remains incompletely understood, laboratory investigations indicate that they are clonal disorders affecting hematopoietic stem cells characterized by a progressive imbalance between self-renewal and differentiation. Despite karyotypic resemblance to acute myeloid leukemia, fundamental biologic differences may underly the disappointing results achieved to date with intensive chemotherapy. The recent availability of recombinant hematopoietic growth factors for use in clinical trials has shown that the maturation defect in many instances can be overcome with administration of lineage-restricted recombinant hematopoietins. Routine use of these promising agents must await results of randomized clinical trials to determine the impact of prolonged treatment on leukemic evolution and disease-related morbidity.\r"

In accordance with the results of a methodological study, also reported here, the animals had an intramuscular injection of 65ZnCl2 12 d before the start of the collection period. Total fecal (endogenous + unabsorbed) zinc excretion for d 69-73 in the three groups was 2.3, 20.4 and 91.0 mg. The endogenous zinc excretion was 1.3, 2.0 and 6.4 mg, corresponding to 80.8, 10.6 and 6.4% of the zinc intake. Thus, the endogenous excretion was mainly important for the zinc homeostasis at low zinc intake, whereas at high intake the homeostasis was regulated via absorption from the digestive tract. The overall conclusion of the experiment was that mink are comparable to other species (including man) in regard to mechanisms controlling zinc homeostasis.\r"

Rats were given iron-deficient or control diets after weaning at 21 d of age and intraperitoneal iron dextran (50 mg/kg) at 45 d of age. Time to fatigue during an easy walking exercise (endurance) was measured 15 and 18 h after iron dextran or saline injection. Endurance increased more than threefold compared to the saline-treated, iron-deficient animals without a significant change in hemoglobin concentration. This prompt improvement suggests that lack of cofactor iron might play a metabolically important role in impairing exercise performance in the severely iron-deficient rat.\r"

We recommend that a cut-off of -2.0 SD (2.3 percentile) for weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height on National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reference growth charts be used to estimate and monitor the prevalence of undernutrition in the United States, in accordance with guidelines of the World Health Organization. Epidemiological research on population-based risk factors for undernutrition and its functional consequences is required to identify the appropriate nutritional indicator and cut-off for screening and monitoring and evaluation of interventions.\r"

The placebo (n = 29) and treated (n = 28) groups were comparable in birth weight (mean +/- SD: 1273 +/- 323 vs 1318 +/- 359 gm), gestational age (30.1 +/- 2.1 vs 30.8 +/- 2.7 weeks), postnatal age (8.7 +/- 3.1 vs 8.5 +/- 3.1 hours), and pulmonary function at the start of the study. The dose of dexamethasone was 1.0 mg/kg/day for 3 days and then was progressively decreased for 12 days. Infants in the dexamethasone group had significantly higher pulmonary compliance, tidal volume, and minute ventilation, and required lower mean airway pressure for ventilation than infants in the placebo group. The endotracheal tube was successfully removed from more infants in the dexamethasone group (16/28 vs 8/29; p less than 0.025). Nineteen infants (65%) in the placebo group and 11 (39%) in the dexamethasone group (p less than 0.05) had lung injuries. Dexamethasone therapy was associated with a temporary increase in blood pressure and plasma glucose concentration and a delay in somatic growth. We conclude that early postnatal dexamethasone therapy improves pulmonary status, facilitates removal of the endotracheal tube, and minimizes lung injuries in premature infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome.\r"

The studies were conducted after at least 3 consecutive days of full oral feeds at a mean age of approximately 23 days. There was no difference between groups in percentage of apparent absorption of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, copper, or manganese. Retention of these nutrients was similar to or greater than that which occurs in utero. Calcium absorption was 75% of intake. These results indicate that reducing the lactose content of premature-infant formulas to 50% of the carbohydrate does not impair mineral absorption.\r"

Weight, height, and head circumference were measured at birth and at 40 weeks and 4, 8, and 12 months of gestation-corrected age on at least 553 infants each time. Descriptive statistics for all growth variables and a body mass index (kilograms per square meter), plotted by sex and birth weight group, demonstrated growth patterns lower than published standards for term infants of the same age and sex. These patterns of growth differed by birth weight group. No catch-up growth was noted by the 12-month examination (gestation-corrected age) for any birth weight group. We conclude that low birth weight preterm infants have different patterns of growth than term infants during the first year of life, even with plotting corrected for gestational age.\r"

None had preexisting renal tubular injury. The syndrome developed at cumulative doses of ifosfamide of 39 to 99 gm/m2. Low serum bicarbonate and phosphate concentrations with glucosuria, aminoaciduria, and hypochloremic metabolic acidosis were the manifestations of the Fanconi syndrome. Bicarbonate and phosphate replacement resulted in bone healing, but recovery of tubular and glomerular function did not occur. Monitoring of these laboratory values during ifosfamide therapy could allow earlier replacement therapy to prevent severe bone disease.\r"

According to current recommendations, healthy infants do not need supplements if vitamin D-fortified milk is used, the diet includes adequate vitamin C, and iron-fortified cereals or formula are used. Infants fed human milk exclusively may need vitamin D supplements. Nevertheless, approximately one third to one half of 6- to 12-month-old U.S. infants receive nutrient supplements, as liquid vitamin A, D, and C preparations or multivitamin preparations, with or without iron or fluoride. Recent surveys suggest that most infants have more than adequate vitamin and mineral intakes, with the possible exception of iron. The risk of poor vitamin A status is less likely than the risk of poor water-soluble-vitamin or iron status in the United States. Possibly marginal intakes of zinc and copper (not in currently available infant supplements) suggest the need for further research. Research, infant supplement formulation reevaluation, and education are suggested so that nutrient supplements for prophylaxis can be used most effectively and appropriately.\r"

  ".W": "During the latter half of an infant's first year, adequate mineral and vitamin D intakes may be important not only for the prevention of rickets but also for the attainment of optimal adult peak bone mass. Ingestion of 400 IU vitamin D per day, either as a supplement or contained in formula or table milk, will result in normal serum concentrations of vitamin D,25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Human milk from a vitamin D-sufficient mother provides a marginal amount, less than 100 IU/L/day of total vitamin D activity from the vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Infants exclusively fed human milk of vitamin D-deficient mothers, who do not receive additional vitamin D or adequate exposure to sunlight, are at significant risk for vitamin D-deficiency rickets. The low concentration of phosphorus in human milk is adequate for most term infants but probably compounds any vitamin D deficiency. Intake of phosphorus from formula or table milk is more than adequate, and the addition of baby foods increases this mineral's intake to generous levels. Calcium is well absorbed and adequate in human milk if vitamin D is sufficient, but concern exists about calcium intake from infant formulas for this older group. My colleagues and I have conducted studies of bone mineral content and mineral homeostasis in term infants fed human milk (300 mg/L calcium), standard cow milk formula (440/mg/L calcium), or a soybean formula (600 mg/L calcium); our findings suggest that all three types of feedings provided comparable bone mineralization and normal indicators of mineral homeostasis. Mean calcium retentions at 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months in all three groups were between 138 and 205 mg/day, substantially more than the 130 mg/day estimated to be needed from body composition data. Estimates for phosphorus were similarly generous. The questions of whether higher calcium intakes will result in further increases in bone mineral content and of the effect of beikost on calcium absorption from different milks require further study.\r"

Opportunities to add to knowledge of the physiologic significance and dietary adequacy of trace elements in human nutrition are provided by recent analytic advances. Specific, sensitive, and reliable methods for the detection of trace element imbalances are sorely needed. Although several factors influence the dietary needs of these essential elements, the basis for establishing dietary needs in infants is hindered by the death of studies that have assessed their bioavailability in this age group. Thus until it has been conclusively shown otherwise, the physiologic response to human milk is used as the standard for infant feeding practices. This review is limited primarily to the physiologic significance and bioavailability of zinc, copper, manganese, molybdenum, chromium, fluoride, and selenium. The space devoted to each trace element is not meant to represent the element's importance but, rather, to reflect some of the present understanding of its metabolism and utilization.\r"

  ".W": "The feeding relationship is the complex of interactions that take place between parent and child as they engage in food selection, ingestion, and regulation behaviors. Effective feeding supports a child's developmental tasks of homeostasis, attachment, and separation. Feeding of the newborn infant is most successful when parents allow the infant to determine timing, amount, preference, pacing, and eating capability. During the attachment phase, such infant-controlled behaviors allow parents to engage affectively with the child. Successful regulation of state and attachment provides the groundwork for the separation-individuation phase. In feeding, effective parents provide opportunities to explore but also provide structure and limits. Feeding and growth problems often stem from distorted dynamics around feeding, which can be indicative of distorted parent-child interactions. Incidence estimates range from 1% to 2% for severe and prolonged problems to 25% to 35% for common difficulties such as food refusal and \"overeating.\" An evaluation of feeding dynamics should always be made as part of the diagnostic study of a child who is eating or growing inappropriately. To prevent problems in feeding, practitioners may teach and support positive feeding dynamics as part of primary care, refer parents for instruction in positive approaches to feeding, and detect and refer attitudinal and behavioral problems early.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled toxicity trial of therapy with tamoxifen (10 mg twice a day) in 140 postmenopausal women with a history of breast cancer and histologically negative axillary lymph nodes. These women had been treated with surgery with or without radiotherapy. At a 3-month evaluation, tamoxifen-treated women showed a significant decrease in fasting plasma levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which persisted at 6- and 12-month evaluations. During the first 12 months, plasma triglyceride levels increased; small but significant decreases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) were observed in tamoxifen-treated women, but ratios of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol and of LDL to HDL cholesterol changed favorably. While data relating lipid/lipoprotein profiles and cardiovascular disease are limited in women, current evidence suggests that total cholesterol and possibly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are risk factors. We conclude that during the first 12 months of treatment, tamoxifen exerts a favorable effect on the lipid profile in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer.\r"

Two weeks later, patients received dacarbazine (1,200 mg/m2) chemotherapy. Two patients achieved complete remission, and five achieved a partial remission for a response rate of 26% (95% confidence interval = 12%-47%). Three patients had mixed responses. The partial and mixed responses were brief, ranging from 1 month to 6 months, whereas the two complete responses have been sustained for 13+ and 24+ months. There were no additive toxic effects except for thrombocytopenia, which delayed treatment in two patients. Alternating adoptive immunotherapy and dacarbazine chemotherapy appear to be reasonably tolerated by patients, but the response rate is not clearly better than that achieved with other rIL-2 regimens or with chemotherapy alone.\r"

A checklist of triage criteria was used. During a 6-month period, 342 patients (29.7% of trauma admissions) satisfied the triage criteria, which should have resulted in an average of 1.9 trauma team calls per day. Staff compliance with the triage tool was 75.4%. The overtriage rate for the checklist criteria was 52.7%. The triage tool identified patients with severe injuries who were not initially considered sufficiently injured to justify initiation of the trauma team response. The sensitivity of the triage tool in identifying patients with serious injury was 95.0%. Comparison of the review with a similar review performed 12 months earlier demonstrated that staff compliance with initiating the trauma team response had improved. Using data from 564 patients from both series, logistic regression analysis of the power of the triage criteria to predict serious injury contributed to a revision of the triage criteria. This trauma triage tool and trauma team response constitute a valid approach to the early hospital management of trauma patients. This system may be more appropriate or achievable in many hospitals than the construction of dedicated trauma reception units or permanent surgical staffing of general Accident and Emergency departments.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed an implantable 20 MHz Doppler flow sensor, to monitor blood flow in patients after operation. During surgery the sensor is wrapped around a blood vessel and secured in place with a releasable tie. No tissue puncturing techniques are required. The lead wires, together with a release cable, are exteriorized through the chest wall. Several days after operation, the tie is externally released, and the sensor is pulled out. Twenty-seven sensors were implanted in 24 dogs for up to 16 days. All were extracted successfully with minimal visible behavioral reaction in the awake dogs and caused no thrombosis or vascular damage. The Doppler velocity signals had excellent linear correlations (r = 0.99) with data from electromagnetic flow sensors and timed blood collections. In addition, the sensors were applied to coronary artery bypass grafts in 31 patients for up to 2 days after operation. High-quality signals were obtained, and intraoperatively recorded signals agreed well with simultaneous electromagnetic flow tracings. All sensors were extracted with minimal discomfort to the awake patients and with no complications. Thus, the implantable flow sensor is a safe, reliable, accurate, and simple method for intraoperative and postoperative monitoring of blood flow in vessels 2.5 to 5 mm in diameter.\r"

  ".W": "Accurate hemodynamic evaluation of the aortoiliac system for the purpose of determining the need for an inflow procedure currently requires invasive pressure measurements. This study was undertaken to evaluate a noninvasive technique with the aortofemoral transfer function. Twenty-eight human aortoiliac segments were studied with intraarterial pressure measurements, with and without papaverine injection, and by calculation of the Doppler-derived mean power frequency index obtained by digital signal processing of aortic and femoral spectra. The procedure is menu driven and can be performed by any duplex ultrasound technologist. This technique involves recording 20 aortic and 20 femoral Doppler signals, requiring less than 1 minute of data acquisition time. Intraarterial pressure measurements were used to classify arteries into the three following groups: (1) normal arteries, (2) arteries with subcritical stenoses, and (3) arteries with critical stenoses. The mean power frequency index of group 1 arteries (n = 7) was 0.63 +/- 0.04, of group 2 arteries (n = 6) was 0.46 +/- 0.02, and of group 3 arteries (n = 15) was 0.21 +/- 0.05. These mean power frequency index values were significantly different by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (p less than 0.0001). Each group could be differentiated from the other groups with a sensitivity of 0.83 to 1.00, a specificity of 1.00, and an accuracy of 0.92 to 1.00 compared to intraarterial pressure measurements, including papaverine testing. Measurement of the mean power frequency index is a rapid, noninvasive technique that diagnoses and quantifies aortoiliac stenoses with an accuracy similar to intraarterial pressure measurements.\r"

  ".W": "A rapid and reliable harvest and culture technique was developed to provide a sufficient number of autologous endothelial cells for the confluent in vitro lining of cardiovascular prostheses. Enzymatic endothelial cell detachment was achieved by the in situ application of collagenase to short vessel segments. This harvest technique resulted in a complete lack of contaminating smooth muscle cells in all of 124 cultures from nonhuman primates and 13 cultures from human adults. The use of a microgrid technique enabled the daily in situ quantification of available endothelial cells. To assess ideal plating densities after passage the population doubling time was continuously related to the cell density. Surprisingly, a low plating density of 1.5 X 10(3) endothelial cells/cm2 achieved 43% shorter cell cycles than the usual plating density of 1.0 X 10(4) endothelial cells/cm2. Moreover, low density plating enabled mass cultures after one single cell passage, thereby reducing the cell damaging effect of trypsin. When the growth characteristics of endothelial cells from five anatomically different vessel sites were compared, the external jugular vein--which would be easily accessible and dispensable in each patient--proved to be an excellent source for endothelial cell cultures. By applying in situ administration of collagenase, low density plating and microgrid follow-up to adult human saphenous vein endothelial cells, 14,000,000 first passage endothelial cells--sufficient for the in vitro lining of long vascular prostheses--were obtained 26.2 days after harvest. (95% confidence interval:22.3 to 32.2 days).\r"

Jitter, shimmer, and glottographic quotients were measured to assess changes in vibratory pattern. The mean and range of frequencies in contextual speech was also determined. Analysis of the preoperative and postoperative data from two patients with over 1 year follow-up showed a decrease in frequency of vibration. Postoperatively, the vocal folds still vibrated in a regular pattern as described by the myoelastic-aerodynamic theory. There was no increase in jitter or shimmer quotient. The Isshiki type III thyroplasty appears capable of lowering fundamental frequency of speech without adversely affecting the vibratory mode of the vocal folds.\r"

The current anatomical site classification is ambiguous for some laryngeal and pharyngeal subsites, and modifications to the present system based on prognostic values are proposed. A difference in patient age between tumor categories has been shown, and various differences in incidence and survival data for the sexes have been demonstrated. Differences in observed and expected survival rates are related to continued late deaths from tumor. Multivariate analyses have shown that stage grouping is the most powerful prognostic discriminator, followed by anatomical site and age.\r"

A later age of menarche and a higher prevalence of amenorrhea and luteal suppression have been observed in athletes, but there is no experimental evidence that athletic training delays menarche, and alternative sociological and statistical explanations for delayed menarche have been offered. Cross-sectional studies of amenorrheic athletes have revealed abnormal reproductive hormone patterns, suggesting that the GnRH pulse generator in the hypothalamus is failing to initiate normal hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function. Longitudinal data show that the abrupt initiation of a high volume of aerobic training can disrupt the menstrual cycle in at least some women, but these women may be more susceptible to reproductive disruption than others, and some aspect of athletic training other than exercise (such as caloric deficiency) may be responsible for the observed disruption. Luteal suppression may be an intermediate condition between menstrual regularity and amenorrhea in athletes, or it may be the endpoint of a successful acclimation to exercise training. A potential endocrine mechanism of menstrual disruption in athletes involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is discussed. Finally, promising future directions for research on this topic are described.\r"

Estrogen deficiency in premenopausal women with secondary amenorrhea related to athletic training or anorexia nervosa is also associated with decreased lumbar bone mineral density. The purpose of this review is to present four concepts related to the adaptations of bone to physical exercise, as a basis to explain the loss of bone mass in women with athletic amenorrhea. These concepts are based on Lanyon's theory of a Minimum Effective Strain-Related Stimulus. The bone remodeling response to estrogen deficiency is an increase in the rate of bone remodeling activity and in the rate of bone resorption relative to formation, resulting in a net loss of bone mass. In the presence of estrogen deficiency, the stimulus of physical activity is thought first to decrease the rate of turnover and secondly to increase bone formation. Endurance exercise training appears to be an insufficient stimulus to accomplish both tasks, which may explain why these athletes often have low lumbar bone mineral density.\r"

  ".W": "Although estradiol (E2) is considered primarily for its role in reproduction, it can exert numerous physiological actions on a variety of tissues. However, there are several difficulties in isolating these actions and determining its impact for in vivo situations. Despite the limitations, it does appear that E2 can alter, under certain conditions, resting and acute exercise metabolism and blood glucose regulation. Specifically, E2 can increase lipid availability and utilization and decrease gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Development of glucose intolerance as a result of insulin insensitivity has also been documented. The mechanisms of E2 may be through direct alterations in key enzyme activity and membrane permeability or indirectly via changes in insulin:glucagon, cortisol, hGH, and catecholamine levels or sensitivity. Future research should focus on understanding the effects of exercise and diet on chronic E2 status and the resulting impact for a variety of conditions that include reproductive and skeletal integrity and predisposing metabolic risk factors for CAD and diabetes. In order to make meaningful correlations between E2 levels and physiological measurements such as bone mineral content, lipid profiles, glucose intolerance, etc., there needs to be a standard guideline for determining and defining one's \"estrogen status.\" Finally, in order to identify underlying mechanisms, an understanding of and appreciation for the interrelationships among the numerous compositional, metabolic, and (neuro)endocrine factors involved is needed. A general model is presented, along with specific applications, to study these interactions.\r"

Each trial consisted of 20 min of lateral supine rest on land, 20 min of immersion to the level of the xiphoid in 30 degrees C water, 20 min of exercise at 60% predicted maximal capacity, and 20 min of lateral supine recovery. Resting beta-endorphin concentrations were elevated during the 15th wk (137.4 +/- 77.4 pg.ml-1) compared to post partum levels (19.8 +/- 17.6). However, neither was different from the 25th (65.6 +/- 68.4) or 35th (48.0 +/- 54.4) wk. Immersion increased beta-endorphin during the post partum trials but resulted in no consistent change during pregnancy. Conversely, exercise had no effect on beta-endorphin post partum but significantly elevated it during pregnancy, the greatest increase occurring during the 15th wk compared to the 25th or 35th wk. Twenty minutes after exercise, beta-endorphin returned to resting levels during all trials. It was concluded that the effect of pregnancy on plasma beta-endorphin is greater than the effect of exercise. Furthermore, pregnancy seems to accentuate the exercise-induced increase in beta-endorphin.\r"

  ".W": "Data are presented which demonstrate that phasic/glycolytic muscles atrophy more than tonic/oxidative muscles in response to exogenously introduced glucocorticoids. Data are also presented demonstrating that immobilization makes a muscle unusually sensitive to glucocorticoid-induced atrophy and that remobilization of a previously immobilized muscle protects a muscle from glucocorticoid-induced atrophy. These observations are discussed within the context of the role of mechanical activity in the acquisition and maintenance of fiber-type characteristics. In addition, the available data on the glucocorticoid receptor population in skeletal muscles of various types and circumstance are reviewed within the context of the recent observations concerning the glucocorticoid induction of the enzyme glutamine synthetase in skeletal muscle. It is proposed here that atrophy is not necessarily the response of skeletal muscle to glucocorticoids. Rather, atrophy is a possible consequence of the glucocorticoid-induced increase in export of amino acid carbon from the muscle. Whether such export causes a muscle to atrophy or perhaps even hypertrophy will depend on the capacity of the muscle to sustain its free amino acid pools. Mechanical activity greatly promotes the uptake of free amino acids in skeletal muscle. Such promotion takes the form of both contraction-induced uptake and increased insulin sensitivity. Within this perspective, it is suggested that tonic muscles and remobilized muscles are protected from atrophy by exogenous glucocorticoids because their high level of mechanical activity allows them to maintain their free amino acid pools.\r"

The enlargement can occur rapidly within 2 d, yet recent evidence suggests that the increased mass is lost with prolonged treatment. Total protein synthesis rates have not been consistently observed to increase during the growth phase and are reduced to 50-60% of control rates by 7 d of hormone injections. Myosin heavy chain synthesis also is not elevated during the growth phase and is also reduced by 1 wk of treatment. Ventricular relative isomyosin content (V1, V2, V3), as determined by pyrophosphate gel electrophoresis, is shifted from V1 to V3 by approximately 10% after 11 d of steroid treatment. These results demonstrate that the glucocorticoid induction of increased ventricular mass is temporary under certain conditions. The down-regulation of the myosin heavy chains may prove as a potentially important protein for understanding the regulation of cardiac catabolism caused by glucocorticoids.\r"

Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, caused striking, receptor-mediated increases in both glutamine synthetase activity and the steady-state glutamine synthetase mRNA level. This effect was observed in rat skeletal muscle cells in culture, as well as in rat muscles in vivo. Glucocorticoid-mediated induction of glutamine synthetase was blocked by androgenic/anabolic steroids at high doses, suggesting that anabolic steroids might have an anticatabolic mode of action in enhancing skeletal muscle mass in athletes. Further studies of the control of glutamine synthetase expression may shed light on mechanisms of muscle atrophy and hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "This work evaluated the anticatabolic capacity of androgenic-anabolic steroids and exercise (contractile activity) in inhibiting skeletal muscle atrophy associated with excessive levels of circulating glucocorticoids. With androgenic-anabolic steroids, most binding studies indicate that they have very low binding specificity for the glucocorticoid receptor. Androgens may interact through their own receptor to interfere with glucocorticoid functioning at the gene level, but this remains unproven. Current literature suggests that androgens do not prevent atrophy but may retard growth suppression accompanying glucocorticoid treatment. With exercise, functional overload, resistance, and endurance types of training are capable of preventing muscle atrophy from glucocorticoids. Androgen and glucocorticoid-receptor binding and glucocorticoid-receptor activation studies have, thus far, not established that atrophy prevention is mediated through the receptor. In conclusion, the role of androgenic-anabolic steroids as glucocorticoid antagonists requires further study. Study of the effects of exercise on muscle gene expression of glucocorticoid-inducible proteins is needed to gain additional understanding of this mechanism of atrophy prevention.\r"

  ".U": "90340353\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The capability of activated oncogenes to induce malignant transformation of immortalized cells in vitro has suggested that they have a similar role in the pathogenesis of human tumors. We previously found that activation of the K-ras oncogene by a point mutation in codon 12 occurs in about one third of human lung adenocarcinomas. METHODS. We studied the clinical importance of this oncogene-activation in 69 patients with lung adenocarcinoma in whom complete resection of the tumor was possible. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify ras-specific sequences of DNA isolated from frozen or paraffin-embedded tumor samples. Ras point mutations were subsequently detected and classified with the use of mutation-specific oligonucleotide probes. RESULTS. Nineteen of the tumors harbored a point mutation in codon 12 of the K-ras oncogene. There was no association between the K-ras point mutation and the age at diagnosis, sex, or presence of previous or concurrent neoplasms. Tumors positive for K-ras point mutations tended to be smaller and less differentiated than those without mutations. The K-ras codon-12 point mutation was a strong (and unfavorable) prognostic factor: 12 of the 19 patients with K-ras point-mutation-positive tumors died during the follow-up period, as compared with 16 of the 50 patients with no mutation in the K-ras oncogene (P = 0.002). This difference in prognosis was also reflected in the duration of disease-free survival (P = 0.038) and in the number of deaths due to cancer (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The presence of K-ras point mutations defines a subgroup of patients with lung adenocarcinoma in whom the prognosis is very poor and disease-free survival is not usually long despite radical resection and a small tumor load.\r"

Compared with placebo, Botox produced statistically significant improvement in the severity of torticollis, disability, pain, and degree of head turning. There were no serious side effects. During the double-blind phase, 61% of patients injected with Botox improved; 74% of patients subsequently improved during a later open phase at a higher dose of Botox. Direction of head turning, severity of torticollis, and presence or absence of jerky movements did not significantly influence the response rate. We conclude that Botox is a valuable treatment for spasmodic torticollis.\r"

In the asymptomatic twin, the peripheral blood lymphocyte karyotype was 46,XX. In the affected twin, 18% of cells were 45,X, and the others 46,XX, without X/autosome translocation. DNA analysis did not reveal a deletion at the DMD locus. Immunologic studies of dystrophin showed a partial deficiency of the protein that was more severe in the symptomatic twin.

The small subpopulations of neurons that stained immunohistochemically for either somatostatin- or parvalbumin-like reactivity were atypically affected by these excitotoxins. Limited exposure to kainate or AMPA did little damage to the general neuronal population, but destroyed nearly all somatostatin- or parvalbumin-reactive cells. Conversely, these immunoreactive cells were more resistant to NMDA-induced injury than the general population. In view of reports suggesting that somatostatin- and parvalbumin-reactive cortical neurons may be preferentially damaged in Alzheimer's disease, these observations support a hypothesis that the overactivation of non-NMDA receptors could be involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.\r"

Those who delivered after the spontaneous onset of labor are reported here. Compared with the EDC calculated from the LMP, the EDC calculated from the BPD was postponed more than 1 week for 406 women (17.5%) and advanced more than 1 week for 56 (2.4%). For these women, the BPD estimate of EDC turned out to be closer to the day of delivery in 264 cases, whereas the LMP estimate was closer in 125 (P less than .001). For 73 women, the estimates were equally good. For 80.1% of the women, the two estimates of EDC differed by 1 week or less; in these cases, the estimates were equally good in predicting the day of delivery. We conclude that the BPD is a better predictor of the spontaneous onset of labor than is the LMP.\r"

Patients were eligible for the study if they were in labor or had ruptured membranes at the time of surgery. In a randomized, double-blind manner, 377 women were assigned to receive 2 g of cefazolin (192) or 2 g of cefotetan (185) intravenously immediately after the infant's umbilical cord was clamped. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to the frequency of febrile morbidity (22.4 versus 21.6%), the mean fever index (15.8 versus 14.9 degree-hours), the frequency of endometritis (19.3 versus 21.1%), or the mean duration of postoperative hospitalization (3.8 versus 3.9 days). Among patients who became infected despite prophylaxis, enterococcus was isolated with disproportionate frequency. This organism was responsible for 89% of the postoperative urinary tract infections and all three cases of bacteremia. It was also the second most common isolate in women with endometritis. A single dose of cefazolin is comparable in effectiveness to cefotetan. In view of the cost difference between the two antibiotics, there is no justification for use of the more expensive, extended-spectrum agent.\r"

Mild cerebral ventricular dilatation (three) and hyperechogenic bowel (five) are new findings that have not been generally associated with Down syndrome. A variety of prenatal sonographic abnormalities may be associated with Down syndrome, and the frequency of detecting most abnormalities increases with menstrual age. Anomalies more frequently detected before 20 weeks include cystic hygromas, nuchal thickening, and hyperechogenic bowel. Awareness of the sonographic findings associated with Down syndrome should result in improved detection of this disorder.\r"

Expression of both of these cell surface molecules decreased as cells underwent differentiation toward the mucosal surface. In contrast, both epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-2/neu were expressed throughout the entire thickness of the epithelium by undifferentiated squamous cells in squamous metaplasia, raised condyloma, and carcinoma in situ. In 34 squamous cancers of the cervix, vulva, and vagina, all malignant cells were found to have moderate to heavy staining for epidermal growth factor receptor. Staining of 33 of these cancers for HER-2/neu was light, although one patient who presented with distant metastases had heavy staining for HER-2/neu. These data suggest that although overexpression of HER-2/neu in squamous cancers of the lower genital tract is a rare event, it may be associated with aggressive biologic behavior.\r"

The infant was delivered by elective cesarean, and the ultrasound findings were confirmed. Color flow Doppler and transvaginal ultrasound facilitate this diagnosis because the internal os and surrounding structures are easier to visualize; in addition, vascular flow and Doppler patterns characteristic of the umbilical cord can be demonstrated in structures suspected to be vessels.\r"

Death attributable to vasectomy in the United States is exceedingly rare, and major perioperative morbidity is quite uncommon. No long-term adverse health effects have been documented, and much evidence supports the conclusion that vasectomy does not increase the risk of subsequent atherosclerosis. Vasectomy, like tubal sterilization, should be considered a permanent decision, because reversal surgery is expensive and requires substantial surgical expertise. Although vasectomy reversal is often successful, it cannot be guaranteed even in the best of circumstances, and when the vasectomy has caused epididymal obstruction, reversal is often unsuccessful. Vasectomy represents a safe and effective alternative to tubal sterilization for couples who decide that the male should be sterilized.\r"

  ".W": "Anterior stromal puncture has recently been proposed as a new treatment for recalcitrant cases of recurrent corneal erosion. Concerns about the risks of corneal perforation and scarring, as well as doubts regarding its efficacy have prevented many patients from benefiting from this procedure. We introduce a new, inexpensive, commercially available instrument designed to standardize this technique, minimize scarring, and prevent corneal perforation. In a clinical trial involving 25 consecutive patients with recurrent erosions resistant to vigorous conservative treatment, the first 11 patients underwent stromal puncture in which a straight tuberculin needle was used; the following 14 were treated with a newly designed prototype needle. All patients in this series remained free of erosions after completion of stromal puncture, except for one woman with marked diffuse anterior basement membrane dystrophy, who went on to develop spontaneous bilateral erosions. Follow-up ranged from 2 months to 30 months (mean, 13 months). There were no complications of stromal puncture, and subjective and objective evaluations revealed no significant postoperative glare. Microscopic analysis of eye bank eyes subjected to anterior stromal puncture procedures demonstrated that the new prototype needle provided shallower penetration and thus less likelihood of perforation or excessive scarring than the straight needle. Also, postoperative discomfort and scarring appeared to be significantly less in patients treated with the prototype needle.\r"

The control group (N = 10) had a standard double running suture procedure with no postoperative adjustment; the single running 10-0 nylon suture was removed 3 months after surgery. Four months after penetrating keratoplasty, mean (+/- standard deviation) astigmatism in the test group was 1.7 +/- 0.7 diopters (D), and all patients had less than 2.6 D of astigmatism. In the control group, mean astigmatism was significantly higher (5.4 +/- 2.4 D; range, 0.7-9.0 D; P less than 0.01).

Of all the bullous diseases, CP and EM not only involve the conjunctiva most frequently but also cause the most severe conjunctival disease. A chronic, progressive disease, CP is characterized by shrinkage of the conjunctiva, symblepharon, entropion, trichiasis, dry eye, and finally reduced vision from corneal opacification. It is primarily a disease of the elderly that affects more women than men and is characterized by blisters or bullae in a subepithelial location and immunoglobulins and complement bound to the basement membrane zone of skin and mucous membranes including the conjunctiva. Circulating antibodies to the basement membrane zone can be demonstrated occasionally. Treatment includes artificial tears, topical antibiotics, correction of entropion and trichiasis, therapeutic soft contact lenses, and systemic immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids. An acute, generally self-limited, inflammatory disorder of the skin and mucous membranes, EM occurs primarily in young, healthy individuals. The most frequent precipitating factors are (1) drugs and (2) infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and herpes simplex. Conjunctival involvement ranges from a mild catarrhal conjunctivitis which terminates without sequelae to membranous conjunctivitis which may heal leaving scarring, symblepharon, and even ankyloblepharon. Histopathologic findings include subepithelial bullae and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates. Patients with EM have circulating immune complexes and immunoreactant deposition in the blood vessel walls of the dermis. After the acute episode has subsided, they may require artificial tears, topical antibiotics, correction of entropion and trichiasis, therapeutic soft contact lenses, tarsorrhaphy, and mucous membrane grafts.\r"

Complications include failure to thrive, metabolic alkalosis, and respiratory distress which can be life-threatening. In children over the age of 2 years, adenoidal and tonsillar hypertrophy is more commonly the cause of upper airway obstruction. The complications of growth failure, cor pulmonale, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were discussed. Obstructive sleep apnea can cause significant complications in both infants and children. These problems can be life-threatening, cause delay in growth and development, or cause subtle long-term learning disabilities. Surgical management of the airway should correct the metabolic and cardiorespiratory disorders. The correction of learning disabilities has not yet been demonstrated.\r"

The literature is replete with statements that airway impairment alters facial and dental growth, but there also is substantial evidence to the contrary. Much of the confusion stems from the subjective criteria frequently used in defining the terms impairment and mouth breathing. Additionally, respiratory mechanics have often been viewed simplistically rather than in the realistic sense of a complex regulation/control system. Unfortunately, lack of objectivity may lead to an incorrect diagnosis and even worse, inappropriate treatment. Newer respirometric techniques offering more quantitative assessment of respiratory behaviors are now providing more relevant information and more objective definitions of airway impairment and mouth breathing. More recent findings suggest that nasal-oral breathing per se is not necessarily harmful to growth. However, in instances when the nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airspace is small, exaggerated postural responses in obligatory nasal-oral breathers may be detrimental to growth.\r"

  ".U": "90340841\r", 
  ".W": "It becomes apparent that the decision to prescribe home monitoring for the child who has, or is thought to be at risk for, obstructive apnea is not a straightforward one. There have been no studies documenting the effectiveness of home monitoring in this population. The risk of obstructive apnea in some children clearly supports the use of an obstructive apnea detection system. Unfortunately, the current home monitors are not designed to detect obstructive apnea. These monitors may alert parents to obstructive apnea by identifying the changes in heart rate that can accompany these episodes, but this warning may not be timely. There are a number of potential costs that may accrue to families who monitor their children. In some instances the \"costs\" of home monitoring may lead to failure of parents to comply with the treatment or to neglect of other aspects of their child's treatment regimen, thereby effectively increasing the child's risk of obstructive apnea. To achieve the maximum benefits of home monitoring requires high levels of commitment on the part of both the child's physician and his family. Parents need thorough preparation and continuous logistic and professional support if they are to carry out this monitoring. The physician should not need to provide all of this support, but he or she should expect to function in a co-ordinating capacity on behalf of the child and family.\r"

  ".U": "90340842\r", 
  ".W": "The OSA syndrome, described over 100 years ago, was rediscovered in 1966. It is a common disorder, especially among fat, middle-aged men. Stentorian snoring and diurnal somnolence are the cardinal manifestations and should always lead to an examination during sleep. That examination (polysomnography) can demonstrate the pathognomonic events--repetitive apneas occurring in sleep--which signal the failure of the sleeping brain to maintain the patency of the supraglottic airway. All evidence points to the problem being an abnormal pharyngeal airway, one which has a shape or size or compliance that allows inspiratory collapse as the normal loss of pharyngeal dilator muscle tone occurs with sleep. The apneas are asphyxic events terminated by arousals which fragment sleep continuity and lead to the daytime sleepiness. Because the snoring occurs during sleep, the arousals are unremembered, and the sleepiness can develop so gradually that the patient may forget what normal alertness is like. It is important to interview the patient's spouse or partner. Besides obesity and maleness, other risk factors for OSA are diseases that have an impact on the configuration or effective compliance of the pharyngeal passageway. Recent studies support the clinical intuition that sleep apnea is undesirable. Sleepiness leads to accidents. The hypoxemia occurring during apnea can lead to potentially fatal cardiac dysrhythmias. A number of reports suggest that snoring and sleep apnea are associated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial ischemia, and infarction. Finally, there are now two papers showing a significantly decreased probability of 5-year survival in patients with symptomatic sleep apnea. The good news is that treatment with tracheostomy or NCPAP improves mortality rates to normal. Approximately 90 per cent of patients can tolerate a night's initial trial with CPAP. Long-term acceptance of CPAP has now been reviewed in a number of studies, and it appears to be about 65 to 70 per cent.\r"

The mechanism for the relationship between obesity and OSA may be mechanical obstruction or hypoxemia. Patients with obesity often have other medical problems that can exacerbate or complicate OSA. The physician should look for other problems such as diabetes, hypertension, and coronary disease while evaluating an obese patient with OSA. Weight loss is important either as a primary therapy or in conjunction with surgical treatment of OSA. Weight loss methods include behavior modification with diet, very low calorie diets with behavior modification, and bariatric surgery. In morbidly obese patients, more dramatic means such as bariatric surgery or very low calorie diets seem to be preferable because of the significant reduction in the length of time it takes for patients to lose weight. Because of a tendency for obese patients to regain weight, it is important to follow the patients long term to prevent the regaining of weight.\r"

  ".U": "90340908\r", 
  ".W": "The diagnosis of suspected sexual abuse is nearly always based on a description of abuse provided by the child. The physician should invite a child to describe his or her sexual victimization in detail if such a \"disclosure\" interview has not already occurred, if the child seems ready to describe the abuse, and if a child protective services worker has not yet been notified of the suspected abuse. If an allegedly abused child has already been carefully interviewed, however, the physician should instead obtain information from the child's parents or other appropriate adults to determine how best to address the questions being raised. Nonspecific behavioral or somatic complaints unaccompanied by a specific description of sexual abuse should generate a differential diagnosis for further investigation. The goals of the physical examination of the sexually abused child are to identify abnormalities that warrant further diagnostic efforts or treatment, to obtain specimens to screen the patient for sexually transmitted infections, and to make observations and take specimens that may corroborate the patient's history of victimization. These goals should be met in the context of a standard, complete physical examination. The advisability of postcoital contraception should be discussed with every postmenarcheal victim seen within 72 hours after a rape. Because gonorrhea and chlamydial infections are the most prevalent STDs seen after sexual abuse and are often asymptomatic, universal screening for these infections is recommended. Parents of all abused children should be given an opportunity to make an informed choice about HIV screening. Because the risk of acquiring STDs is low, routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for sexually abused children. Physicians must report all cases of suspected sexual abuse to states' child protective services agencies. Failure to do so can incur legal penalties. Reporting sexual assaults of children to local law enforcement officials is strongly advised. The long-term impact of sexual abuse on children's psychological adjustment is unpredictable. In the short term, children's circumstances vary widely. Some show no evidence of psychological distress. Others have severe, pervasive difficulty. Office counseling by the empathetic and knowledgeable primary care physician, short-term crisis counseling, a more formal psychological evaluation, and longer-term psychotherapy may be recommended for individual children, depending on the nature and severity of each child's symptoms, his or her parents' preference, and the availability of services in the child's community.\r"

  ".U": "90340909\r", 
  ".W": "The addition of the colposcope to the armamentarium of the medical investigator of childhood sexual abuse has many advantages. The ability to accurately record anatomic findings has implications for the medical community, the judicial system, the accused, the victim, and the family. Through the use of the photographs produced by this instrument, examiners can inspect physical findings without the time constraints imposed by the short attention span of the young child. If necessary, colleagues can be consulted and interpretations discussed. The availability of these photographs to the courts has reduced the need to re-examine the child for another opinion. The colposcopic photograph has also proved to be an excellent teaching and research tool. As an aid to teaching, the photographs and slides produced by this instrument help the instructor demonstrate anatomic findings while allowing the student time to ask questions. As a research tool, this instrument has opened up a myriad of possibilities for medical examiners. It has facilitated the collection of clinical data, it has allowed the standardization of examination techniques, and with the help of computers it has made possible the sophisticated analysis of the information collected. The colposcope has limitations. Aside from its cost, it is a difficult instrument to use in the examination of the young child. The time required for an examination can increase substantially as the examiner attempts to maneuver the scope into a proper position. During this procedure, the maintenance of the child in a suitable state of relaxation, while avoiding further emotional trauma, can be a challenge. The reality that the photograph is two dimensional and represents only the findings at that moment will always be a limiting factor in its use as a means of assessing a child's anatomy. Even the multimethod approach employed to offset this problem may compound the situation by further increasing the length of the examination. Most of these and other dilemmas encountered in the use of the colposcope can be solved by additional experience with this instrument. Despite the improvements brought about by the introduction of the colposcope, more advanced technology may be needed to help solve some of the problems currently plaguing medical examiners. The use of video tape could provide a solution to the documentation of the changes that occur in the soft tissues as the child moves or becomes more or less relaxed. The potential of the computer appears unlimited, and its application to the problem of the interpretation of findings could make a significant contribution to the field.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Physical abuse, and recently sexual abuse, have been emphasized, although neglect is more often reported. The training approach should also include information on epidemiologies, treatment, and prevention. A high index of suspicion can be taught by learning to identify specific physical and behavioral patterns of abuse, and discrepancies between history and the child's condition, and developing better interview skills. Physicians need to know reporting laws, what happens to reports in their community, and how to challenge adverse decisions. Characteristics of child abuse treatment and prevention programs should be taught to residents and physicians providing primary care to children. Principles of learning can be used with various methods to present child abuse information and skills. Whether educating medical students, general physicians, or child abuse experts, their level of involvement with child abuse and the key concepts appropriate for that level should be identified before training methods can be selected. Pediatricians can play an active role in assuring that education in child abuse occurs for all physicians. Answers to first set of questions: STEP 1. Probably middle class or higher. 2. Probably at least 5 years old. 3. Children should have at least average verbal and intellectual skills; they may need to be formally tested. 4. Parents should have at least average verbal and intellectual skills. Answers to second set of questions: Childhood Comes First 1. Approximately 1 year in many cases. 2. It should not; it is an individualized program. 3. No, but it should be an emotionally stable individual with good interactive skills and willing to make a substantial time commitment. 4. A wide range can be tolerated, but the coach will have to read if the consumer cannot.\r"

  ".W": "The passage of individual state nurse practice acts in the 1900s sharpened and focused attention on the practice and function of professional nurses. However, this had little effect on increasing the demand for nurses. In the 1930s student nurses were in ample supply. They staffed units in hospitals, and seniors served as charge or head nurses. It was World War II when one finally began to see the theme of nursing shortage emerge with a vengeance. The demand far exceeded the supply, creating a severe imbalance. The intervening next 4 decades brought forth many excellent models to minimize the shortage. Even the federal government contributed to the nursing shortage by offering opportunities for better-educated practitioners, teachers, and supervisors. Thus, as the nurse became better prepared, the demand for services increased. Several milestone studies are referenced during the 1970s and 1980s that attempted to balance the nursing shortage equation. The US objectives for the year 2000 provide specific guidelines as to what demands will be placed upon the nurse practitioner and educator. Can we meet those demands? Yes--with the full utilization of information technology to prepare the student and nurse practitioner to take advantage of this enormous information explosion. Will the nursing shortage continue to be a recurring theme? Yes! As nurses become better educated and ready for practice and patient-client problem solving, and as they provide strong voices in health policy formulation, the demands for their services will continue to far exceed the supply.\r"

  ".W": "A variety of lasers are used in medicine and surgery, and the three most common lasers are argon-ion, carbon dioxide, and Nd:YAG. All three lasers are used in urology because there has been demonstrated efficacy. The genitourinary system is vital to sustain life. The kidneys regulate most of the water in the body. Their main functions are to filter the blood impurities, drain off wastes and maintain the balance of essential chemicals in the body in liquid form. The filtration process is complex but practical. The nurse needs to understand the value of using the laser for a number of urologic procedures. The advantages are decreased blood loss, precision, less damage to surrounding tissue, ability to be used through endoscopes, and possible decreasing length of stay. The patient who presents with renal dysfunction must have an in-depth work-up. Preoperative assessment will include the patient's history, both current and past, laboratory studies, and radiologic examinations. Cystoscopy can be used as part of the work-up and at the same time be used therapeutically. Assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation do not change significantly from conventional procedures. The instrumentation, equipment, and supplies are the same with the addition of the laser and the various accessories. Laser lithotripsy has been an important adjunct to current therapy. The use of the laser for superficial bladder tumors has decreased the use of Foley catheters and the need to stay in the hospital. Other laser usage for external lesions has also proved to be efficacious. Patients entering the hospital system could benefit from a case management model of care. Case management uses critical paths to standardize managed care, facilitate discharge, promote cost-effective utilization of resources, and encourage collaborative practice, patient satisfaction, and professional satisfaction.\r"

There is already evidence that laser devices can supplement the complement of balloon and wires used in recanalizing peripheral vascular lesions that previously could not be treated. The skilled nursing management required by the patient with atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease is based on the nursing process principles of assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation combined with the technical understanding and knowledge of the LABA procedure in the operating room.\r"

Currently, photodynamic therapy is under FDA-approved clinical investigational trials in the treatment of tumors of the skin, bronchus, esophagus, bladder, head and neck, and of gynecologic and ocular tumors. Activation of a photosensitizer retained in the cancerous cells, by red light emitted from an argon-tunable dye laser system, produces a photochemical reaction that results in the selective destruction of tumor cells. Although the injected sensitizer results in patient photosensitivity lasting 4 to 8 weeks, there have been no reports of permanent side effects. This treatment can be delivered through fiberoptics--interstitially, endoscopically, retrobulbarly, and externally, and in most cases is performed under local anesthesia. Although this is a relatively new method for treatment of cancer, reports show great promise for palliation and potential cure in some cancer patients.\r"

Two different sequences were selected by this procedure from the calculated pool of 65,536 species. One is the wild-type sequence found in the bacteriophage mRNA; one is varied from wild type at four positions. The binding constants of these two RNA's to T4 DNA polymerase are equivalent.

The symmetric molecule inhibited both protease activity and acute HIV-1 infection in vitro, was at least 10,000-fold more potent against HIV-1 protease than against related enzymes, and appeared to be stable to degradative enzymes. The 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of the inhibitor-enzyme complex demonstrated that the inhibitor binds to the enzyme in a highly symmetric fashion.\r"

Insulin is dominant, since it prevents cAMP and glucocorticoid-stimulated transcription. Glucocorticoid and cAMP response elements have been located in the PEPCK gene and now a 15-base pair insulin-responsive sequence (IRS) is described. Evidence for a binding activity that recognizes this sequence is presented.\r"

The degree of phosphorylation of BglG in vivo was shown to be dependent on the cellular levels of BglF protein, which is both the BglG kinase and phosphatase. The degree of phosphorylation of BglG also depended on the presence or absence of a beta-glucoside, the inducer of operon expression. Addition of inducer to cells in growth medium resulted in rapid dephosphorylation of phosphorylated BglG. The bgl operon is thus regulated by a sensory system that modulates gene expression by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to the external levels of inducer.\r"

Central to this activation is heat shock-inducible binding of the transcriptional activator, termed heat shock factor (HSF), to common regulatory elements, which are located upstream of all heat shock genes. The DNA binding activity of the inactive form of Drosophila HSF was induced in vitro by treatment with polyclonal antibodies to the purified, in vivo-activated factor. This finding, together with observations that high temperature and low pH activate HSF binding in vitro, suggests that the inactive form of HSF can directly recognize and transduce the heat shock signal without undergoing a covalent modification of protein structure.\r"

The virus is found mostly in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage within the CNS, but the possibility of infection of other glial cells has been raised. Therefore, the effects of different HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains were studied in primary cultures of adult human brain containing microglial cells, the resident CNS macrophages, and astrocytes. These cultures could be productively infected with macrophage-adapted HIV-1 isolates but not with T lymphocyte-adapted HIV-1 isolates or two HIV-2 isolates. As determined with a triple-label procedure, primary astrocytes did not express HIV gag antigens and remained normal throughout the 3-week course of infection. In contrast, virus replicated in neighboring microglial cells, often leading to their cell fusion and death. The death of microglial cells, which normally serve immune functions in the CNS, may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalitis or myelopathy.\r"

  ".U": "90341792\r", 
  ".W": "After actively entering its host cells, the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii resides in an intracellular vacuole that is completely unable to fuse with other endocytic or biosynthetic organelles. The fusion blocking requires entry of viable organisms but is irreversible: fusion competence of the vacuole is not restored if the parasite is killed after entry. The fusion block can be overcome, however, by altering the parasite's route of entry. Thus, phagocytosis of viable antibody-coated T. gondii by Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with macrophage-lymphocyte Fc receptors results in the formation of vacuoles that are capable of both fusion and acidification. Phagocytosis and fusion appear to involve a domain of the Fc receptor cytoplasmic tail distinct from that required for localization at clathrin-coated pits. These results suggest that the mechanism of fusion inhibition is likely to reflect a modification of the vacuole membrane at the time of its formation, as opposed to the secretion of a soluble inhibitor by the parasite.\r"

DNA synthesis can be induced in senescent and quiescent HDF by fusing them with cells containing DNA viral oncogenes such as SV40 T antigen, adenovirus E1A, or human papillomavirus E7. Both senescent and quiescent HDF contained the unphosphorylated form (p110Rb) of the retinoblastoma protein, a putative inhibitor of proliferation. After serum stimulation, senescent HDF did not phosphorylate p110Rb and did not enter S phase, whereas quiescent HDF phosphorylated p110Rb and entered S phase. These findings, combined with the observations that T antigen, E1A, and E7 form complexes with, and presumably inactivate, unphosphorylated p110Rb, suggest that failure to phosphorylate p110Rb may be an immediate cause of failure to enter S phase in senescent HDF.\r"

In Xenopus laevis, the matching of visual maps from the two eyes to the optic tectum depends on binocular visual input during the critical period, which extends from late tadpole to early juvenile stages. Alterations in eye position, which produce a mismatch of the tectal maps, normally evoke a compensatory adjustment in the map of the ipsilateral eye only during the critical period. However, continuous application of the glutamate receptor agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) after the normal end of the critical period restores this ability to realign the visual map.\r"

Current methods used for gene analysis include restriction enzyme analysis, polymerase chain reaction amplification, allele-specific oligonucleotides, denaturing gradient gels, and DNA sequence analysis. Gene diagnosis is applicable to many clinical disorders, both genetic and acquired. Requisites are a portion of the gene involved or a segment of DNA that lies close to the gene.\r"

Total bilirubin and serum lactic dehydrogenase were directly related to the degree of anemia in patients with porcine valve dysfunction. Echocardiography confirmed valve dysfunction in only four of eight patients, while cardiac catheterization confirmed valve failure in 16 of 17 patients. Laboratory evidence for hemolysis was minimal in 31 patients who had normal, functioning porcine valves. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia in the presence of a porcine prosthetic heart valve, and in the absence of other causes, warrants a thorough evaluation to rule out valve dysfunction. Routine laboratory screening for hemolysis may aid the early diagnosis of porcine valve failure.\r"

Cases reported before 1970 were compared with those reported during or after 1970. The male-female ratio was 4:1 before 1970 and 1:1 after 1970, yet the mean age has stayed significantly lower for female populations (P less than .02). The use of angiography has increased significantly recently (P = .004). The overall mortality has not improved significantly (P = .08); however, if the initial diagnosis was made by angiography, the survival was significantly better (P less than .025). Surgical intervention remains the standard treatment, but preoperative angiography significantly improves operative results. Anecdotal reports suggest that selected high-risk cases may be successfully managed by therapeutic angiography with embolization.\r"

The lesion should be corrected surgically after the diagnosis is confirmed. Lesions proximal to the gastroduodenal artery may be ligated if there is sufficient collateral flow to the liver. For lesions distal to this artery, surgical resection and reconstruction is required. Selective embolization of intrahepatic or subhepatic aneurysms may be an effective alternative in high-risk patients.

  ".U": "90341903\r", 
  ".W": "The concept of prophylactic mastectomy was nurtured in the shadow of the radical mastectomy. It evolved as preferable to the mutilation caused by the procedure. It developed during a time when the difference between benignancy and malignancy was not as clear and when patients with benign disease were thought to be at significant risk. The idea of surgical prophylaxis accompanied by a superior cosmetic result, in comparison to the radical mastectomy is a noble one. In retrospect, however, it is clear that the indications were ill defined, based often on unfounded risk and predicated on patient and physician anxiety. The scope of risk in carcinoma of the breast has been narrowed, with new information identifying only specific subsets of women with proliferative types of benign disease as more susceptible to the subsequent development of carcinoma. Extensive reviews of material taken at biopsy that had been validated longitudinally have provided data to substantiate this contention. The concept of familial high risk must take into account the number of affected family members, at age diagnosis, menopausal status and bilaterality. The majority of indicants that motivated and propitiated the performance of the bulk of prophylactic mastectomies have lost their relevance. Prophylactic mastectomy for carcinoma, therefore, can perhaps be reserved for women with biopsy-proved, high-risk lesions or an exceptional familial risk, or both, or hereditary risk. Such women must choose for themselves and accept the uncertainty of hypothetic risk reduction, life-long continued surveillance and an altered body image. Guiding patients in the decision should involve a multidisciplinary team composed of a surgical oncologist, geneticist, pathologist, psychotherapist and plastic surgeon. As a concept, the reduction of risk is appealing, but remains yet to prove itself superior to rigorous clinical surveillance with high-quality mammography. The experience reflected in the literature of a seemingly low rate of subsequent carcinoma cannot be judged, because it seems that operations were applied indiscriminantly to patients selected by unknown means and from an unknown population pool. Success based on protecting those not at increased risk only invalidates the operation further. Most surgical and medical oncologists recognize that carcinoma of the breast is either localized or disseminated at the time of the initial diagnosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To answer the crucial question regarding reversibility of diabetic somatic neuropathy by whole-pancreas transplantation, metabolic studies and electron microscopic morphometry of the sciatic and testicular nerves were performed monthly for 2 years in three groups of highly inbred rats: (1) NC, 47 nondiabetic controls; (2) DC, 90 untreated alloxan-induced diabetic controls; and (3) DT, 230 diabetic rats given syngeneic pancreaticoduodenal transplants 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 months after induction of diabetes mellitus (DM). Six diabetic nerve lesions were quantitated by a \"blind\" protocol: (1) loss of myelinated axons, (2) intraaxonal glycogen deposits, (3) axons with glycogen deposits, (4) demyelinated axons, (5) degenerating axons, and (6) loss of intact axoglial junctions in paranodal terminal myelin loops. In the DT group, testicular nerve specimens were obtained just before transplantation and at death so that each animal served as its own control. As we have observed previously in untreated diabetic controls, all six nerve lesions progressed relentlessly for 2 years, in contrast to nondiabetic controls (p less than 0.01). Whole-pancreas transplants produced complete metabolic control of DM for life and reversed all six lesions in both sciatic and testicular nerves, even when done late in the course of DM. There was complete reversal of the nerve lesions when pancreatic transplantation was done within 15 months of the onset of DM. These results provide the first demonstration of reversal of diabetic somatic neuropathy by any form of DM therapy and extend our previous work in which whole-pancreas transplants were found to prevent both diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy and reverse mesangial enlargement in the kidney.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the pancreas of the hamster contains a growth factor(s) that can induce cells associated with the ductular epithelium to differentiate along an endocrine pathway and thereby provide a means of regenerating a functioning islet cell mass. We have shown previously that partial obstruction of the pancreatic duct leads to the induction of nesidioblastosis. A cytosol extract prepared from the partially obstructed hamster pancreas was injected at a dose of 4000 microliters intraperitoneally twice a day for 2 days and produced significant increases in pancreatic weight, protein, and deoxyribonucleic acid of 18%, 18% and 42% respectively, over saline-treated control animals. To assess the effects of this extract on morphology, 150 microliters intraperitoneally twice a day was administered for 21 days. Tissue was processed for histologic, morphometric, and autoradiographic analysis. Budding of endocrine cells from cells of the terminal ductules was observed in cytosol-injected animals and the number of islets per square millimeter was determined to be increased by 100% compared with saline-treated controls (p less than 0.01). Tritiated thymidine uptake by ductal and islet cells was increased tenfold and sixfold, respectively, over that of control animals (p less than 0.01). Cytosol extract was also administered to hamsters rendered diabetic by streptozocin. Survival in these animals was 100% compared with only 60% for saline-treated control animals (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, the blood levels of glucose in cytosol-treated animals was significantly less than the levels in saline-treated controls (p less than 0.05). We conclude that the pancreas does indeed contain a growth factor(s) responsible for the induction of nesidioblastosis and the new islet tissue is functionally capable of stabilizing a diabetic state.\r"

The purposes of this study were to determine whether (1) a sublethal septic insult promotes lung neutrophil accumulation, (2) this pulmonary neutrophil accumulation is reversible, (3) these accumulated neutrophils can be activated to injure lung, and (4) this pulmonary neutrophil accumulation obligates lung injury. Rats were administered low-dose endotoxin, 500 micrograms/kg, intraperitoneally, and at 6 or 12 hours, lungs were harvested and assayed for myeloperoxidase, a marker of neutrophil accumulation, and iodine 125-labeled albumin uptake, a marker of lung injury. A second set of rats were administered low-dose endotoxin and at 6 or 12 hours were given a neutrophil activator formyl-norleucyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FNLP) 250 micrograms/kg, intravenously. At 8 or 14 hours, lungs were harvested and assayed for 125I-labeled albumin uptake. A third set of rats were administered low-dose endotoxin, and at 5 1/2 hours 30 minutes before FNLP administration, they were given a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, methyoxysuccinyl-L-alanine-L-alanine-L-proline-L-valine-chlorometh yl ketone, 2.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally. At 6 hours rats were given FNLP, and at 8 hours lungs were harvested and assayed for 125I-labeled albumin uptake. The following results were obtained: (1) low-dose endotoxin caused a transient increase (p less than 0.05) in lung neutrophil accumulation at 6 hours, which was resolved by 12 hours; (2) lung 125I-labeled albumin uptake was unchanged both 6 and 12 hours after isolated low-dose endotoxin administration; (3) neutrophil activation increased (p less than 0.05) lung 125I-labeled albumin uptake when imposed 6 but not 12 hours after low-dose endotoxin administration; and (4) elastase inhibition decreased (p less than 0.05) the lung 125I-labeled albumin uptake promoted by endotoxin and FNLP. We conclude that sublethal endotoxemia causes a reversible lung neutrophil accumulation and that this lung neutrophil accumulation does not obligate lung injury; but activation of these accumulated neutrophils can promote lung injury, and this neutrophil-associated lung injury is mediated in part by neutrophil elastase.\r"

We grew bovine aortic ECs to confluence on culture plates with flexible membrane bottoms. Vacuum (-20 kPa) was applied to deform the membrane to 24% strain at 60 cycles/min for 1, 3, or 5 days. Control ECs were grown on the same membrane but without vacuum deformation. The conditioned media were collected, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove cells and debris, and the supernatant fluid was subjected to radioimmunoassay for endothelin. The results demonstrate that bovine aortic ECs release a basal level of endothelin under stationary conditions (107.1 +/- 14.7 pg/10(5) cells), and this production increased fivefold to sixfold with cyclic stretch. Thus physical forces exerted on ECs in culture can influence the secretion of this vasoconstrictive molecule.\r"

Such identification is retarded by the slow growth of Candida from clinical specimens. Administration of effective but potentially toxic antifungal therapy is often withheld pending identification. To circumvent this slow growth and thus to expedite diagnosis and therapy, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a segment of fungal DNA coding for the cytochrome P450L1A1 (lanosterol-14 alpha-demethylase) in vitro. The technique provides unambiguous evidence of C. albicans in as few as 6 hours with a detection threshold of 10 organisms in a 100 mu specimen. Clinical specimens of urine (n = 4), sputum (n = 6), wound fluid (n = 1, and blood (n = 2) were collected from patients, and C. albicans was conventionally documented at these sites; in each case, PCR was confirmed. Of 17 additional specimens that were culture negative, PCR suggested the presence of yeast in two of the specimens. PCR-based detection of surgical pathogens may have broad application in rapid screening for the presence of organisms either indigenous to a particular surgical intensive care unit or peculiar to selected patient populations.\r"

  ".U": "90341955\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously noted that bile duct ligation (BDL) in the rat results in decreased creatinine clearance (Ccr) and decreased urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) as well as increased renal prostaglandin (PG) production. This study was undertaken to assess the role of increased renal PG production in the change in renal function after BDL and to determine if these changes are mediated by the renin-angiotensin system. After baseline measurement of renal function, Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either sham operation (SO) or BDL. Four days later animals received a single intraperitoneal injection of either 0.9% saline, 0.5 ml/kg (SO, n = 10; BDL, n = 10), or indomethacin, 5 mg/kg (SO + Indo, n = 10; BDL + Indo, n = 10), and renal function was reassessed. Plasma renin activity was measured at the end of the second study period. BDL resulted in a 40% decrease in Ccr (p = 0.000), a 38% decrease in UNaV (p = 0.002), a twofold increase in urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion (p = 0.005), and fourfold increases in urinary excretion of PGE2 (p = 0.006) and thromboxane B2 (p = 0.000). Indomethacin prevented the increase in urinary PG excretion otherwise seen with BDL and resulted in an additional 41% reduction in UNaV (p = 0.018). Further reductions in Ccr by indomethacin, however, were minimal and nonsignificant. Plasma renin activity did not differ among any of the groups. These findings indicate that the sodium retention associated with BDL is attenuated by the concomitant rise in renal PG production. This elevation in PG production, however, does not protect against the adverse effects of BDL on Ccr. Furthermore, the changes in renal function that occur after BDL do not appear to be mediated by the renin-angiotensin system.\r"

  ".U": "90341957\r", 
  ".W": "Gut-derived endotoxemia has been implicated in postoperative complications in patients with jaundice. It is thought that absence of bile in the gut predisposes to portal absorption of endotoxin and endotoxemia is reversed by oral bile salt replacement or internal biliary drainage and return of bile to the gut, but not by external drainage. We believe that the importance of gastrointestinal bile flow has been overestimated and biliary obstruction and the integrity of hepatocyte and Kupffer cell function are more important in the development and reversal of endotoxemia. In experiment 1, serum endotoxin concentrations were measured in control rats (n = 10) after choledochovesical fistula (n = 15) and bile duct ligation (n = 15) and after relief of biliary obstruction by internal drainage (choledochoduodenostomy; n = 8) and sterile external drainage (choledochovesical fistula; n = 8), with a quantitative limulus assay. In experiment 2, mortality rates were measured in similar groups 48 hours after administration of oral endotoxin (5 mg/100 gm) and intravenous lead acetate (5 mg/100 gm). Bilirubin levels were elevated in bile duct ligation (192 +/- 13 mumols/L) compared with control animals and those with choledochovesical fistula, internal drainage, and external drainage (10.6 +/- 1.5 mumols/L). In experiment 1, significant portal endotoxemia and systemic endotoxemia occurred in bile duct ligation (portal, 130.4 +/- 12.9 pg/ml; systemic, 91.8 +/- 11.0 pg/ml) but not in choledochovesical fistula (portal, 49.3 +/- 17.1 pg/ml; systemic, 27.2 +/- 11.5 pg/ml). Relief of obstruction by both internal and external drainage reversed endotoxemia. In experiment 2, significant death occurred in bile duct ligation (13 of 15) but not in choledochovesical fistula (3 of 15), and relief of obstruction by both internal and external drainage prevented death. These results confirm that biliary obstruction is a more important factor than is gastrointestinal bile flow in the development and reversal of endotoxemia.\r"

Washing had a higher diagnostic yield than brushing in group B.

If this is true all lymphocytes present in the lung should show evidence of prior activation. To test this hypothesis for lymphocytes present on the alveolar surface, the expression of surface antigens, which distinguish unprimed from previously activated cells (CD45RA, CD29, Leu-8), were measured on T lymphocytes recovered from blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from normal subjects and patients with sarcoidosis. Few T lymphocytes from the lavage fluid of normal subjects and patients with sarcoidosis expressed the Leu 8+ or CD45RAbright phenotype expected for \"naive\" cells; more cells had the CD29dull phenotype expected for \"naive\" cells, though five of eight subjects had under 2% of such cells. These findings support the conclusion that the only T lymphocytes present on the surface of the respiratory tract are those recognising antigens that have been previously encountered by the individual. Further studies are required to determine whether \"naive\" T lymphocytes are present in other lung compartments.\r"

The NHLBI has also encouraged research into the effectiveness and safety of alternative diets and further study of human behavior as it relates to adherence to diets. Based on these recommendations and previous studies suggesting a hypocholesterolemic effect of oat bran dietary supplementation, 16 family practice outpatients with elevated cholesterol levels were enrolled in a 12 week study designed to assess the practicality and effectiveness of adding four oat bran muffins per day to the diet. Subjects were randomized into immediate intervention and delayed intervention groups. The combined group had a significant decrease in total cholesterol of 7.9 percent (p less than .03) and in LDL-cholesterol of 10.1 percent (p less than .03) but there was no significant difference with respect to lipid changes between the immediate group and the delay group when the delay group was serving as a control for the immediate group. The results taken in conjunction with evidence in the literature indicate that the simple addition of oat bran muffins to the diet of certain family practice outpatients is well tolerated and probably effective in lowering serum total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol.\r"

The only satisfactory treatment for melanoma is early intervention; therefore, routine screening for melanoma and dysplastic nevi during the general physical examination is important. The prevalence of dysplastic nevi is estimated to be 2 to 5 percent. Patients with dysplastic nevi appear to have at least a 6 percent lifetime risk of melanoma. In the most severely affected patients (those with a family history of dysplastic nevi and more than one melanoma), the lifetime risk may exceed 50 percent. Patients with dysplastic nevi merit periodic follow-up. Since these nevi tend to be familial, close relatives of affected patients may also benefit from a screening examination. Individuals at increased risk for melanoma may display one or more of the following risk factors: dysplastic nevi, freckling, tendency to sunburn and numerous common nevi. Such individuals may benefit most from education in sunburn avoidance, sunscreen use and self-examination for changing nevi. A better informed public and heightened physician awareness are the most effective means of reducing mortality from this virulent malignancy.\r"

To be most effective, drug prophylaxis should be one component of a comprehensive approach that includes avoidance of precipitating factors, improvement in coping skills and, for most patients, increased exercise. The prophylaxis regimen should be individually tailored for each patient. Both physician and patient need to determine whether the benefit of prophylaxis outweighs the inconvenience and possible side effects of the medication used. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, notably propranolol, are most frequently chosen for prophylaxis. Other effective agents include tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, particularly naproxen.\r"

  ".W": "In open-chest dogs the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery diagonal branch was encircled with a pneumatic occluder. Pairs of ultrasonic crystals were inserted into LAD myocardium and remote normal muscle. The coronary artery was occluded for 5 minutes, followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion. This occlusion-reperfusion cycle was repeated 12 times, and after a final 90-minute reperfusion period the hearts were removed and stained with triphenyltetrazolium chloride. No heart had evidence of necrosis. Baseline shortening normalized for end-diastolic length averaged 10.4 +/- 1.0% in the LAD area and 7.4 +/- 0.8% in the remote normal myocardium. When analyzed as a percentage of baseline, segment shortening in the normal myocardium was not significantly altered by LAD occlusion and reperfusion. In contrast, during occlusions the LAD myocardium paradoxically lengthened. With the initial reperfusion, shortening was significantly depressed to 28.6 +/- 8.6% of baseline. Although with subsequent reperfusions the return of function progressively decreased, the rate of deterioration was markedly attenuated after the first occlusion. By the end of the protocol many LAD segments lengthened paradoxically even after reperfusion, but in five hearts in which active contraction was preserved there was no significant change in regional function after the third cycle, suggesting a protective or preconditioning effect of earlier ischemia. There was a moderately good correlation between collateral blood flow and the degree of dysfunction following the initial 10-minute reperfusion (r = -0.73). This correlation deteriorated during subsequent reperfusion periods, implying that collateral blood flow can be a predictor of the extent of myocardial stunning only after the initial one or two reperfusion cycles. Thereafter other as yet unidentified factors make baseline collateral flow unimportant.\r"

For this purpose 246 patients were analyzed retrospectively and 160 prospectively. All patients underwent maximal exercise testing with a standard Bruce protocol and coronary arteriography as part of the diagnostic evaluation for possible or definite coronary artery disease. The Athens QRS score was decreased as the number of obstructed coronary arteries increased (normal coronary arteries = 7.85 +/- 5.23 mm, one-vessel disease = 5.2 +/- 5.3 mm, two-vessel disease = -0.85 +/- 5.4 mm, three-vessel disease = -3.5 +/- 5.8 mm; p less than 0.0001); the score was unrelated to exercise-induced ST segment depression, and negative (less than 0) scores were always associated with coronary artery disease. An Athens QRS score of 5 mm predicted coronary artery disease with sensitivity ranging from 75% to 86% and a specificity ranging from 73% to 79%, values higher than those of the Q wave (75% and 50%, respectively), R wave (65% and 55%), and S wave (70% and 10%) and of the ST segment depression (62% and 70%). It is concluded that exercise-induced changes in the QRS complex provide a useful index not only for the diagnosis but also for the assessment of severity of coronary artery disease.\r"

The study was a randomized double-blind crossover design with patients titrated to maximally tolerated doses of both drugs. Phases included isosorbide dinitrate alone, nifedipine alone, and isosorbide dinitrate plus nifedipine in combination, with efficacy determined by stress testing. Eleven men and one woman patient with a mean age of 60 years and a mean of five anginal episodes/week completed the study. Patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes I, II, and III. With nifedipine alone compared with isosorbide dinitrate alone, patients had fewer angina attacks/week (p less than 0.02), exercised longer before experiencing angina (p less than 0.03), and had less ST segment depression during (p less than 0.03) or after (p less than 0.05) exercise. When patients received isosorbide dinitrate plus nifedipine, only time to onset of angina during exercise (p less than 0.05) was significantly different from the response with isosorbide dinitrate alone. Analysis of variance between nifedipine and isosorbide dinitrate plus nifedipine was not significant. Diastolic blood pressure with isosorbide dinitrate plus nifedipine (p less than 0.04) was lower than with isosorbide dinitrate alone. No significant differences in systolic blood pressure were noted between the treatment groups. The drugs alone and in combination were relatively well tolerated. Nifedipine alone may be superior to isosorbide dinitrate alone. The combination of isosorbide dinitrate plus nifedipine demonstrated no advantage over nifedipine alone compared with isosorbide dinitrate alone.\r"

An understanding of the responsible mechanism or mechanisms is essential not only for appropriate treatment but also for prognostication.

The beta-blocking activity of the two drugs, which was determined by measuring heart rate, blood pressure, and derived indexes at peak plasma drug levels, was similar. Both metoprolol and atenolol significantly reduced forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow, with no difference between drugs. Atenolol but not metoprolol also significantly reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second and specific airway conductance. Both metoprolol and atenolol shifted the dose-response curve of specific airway conductance to the right. The results indicate that the new OROS delivery system for metoprolol, which produces a relatively constant plasma drug level, provides a cardioselectivity comparable to or greater than that of atenolol at maximum plasma levels.\r"

This was a placebo-controlled, randomized, five-period, single-blind, crossover trial in 15 healthy volunteers. Bronchial beta-blockade was estimated as the displacement of the salbutamol bronchodilator response of specific airway conductance (SGAW) measured by whole-body plethysmography. Metoprolol OROS (14/190 mg), slow-release (SR) metoprolol (200 mg), atenolol (100 mg), long-acting (LA) propranolol (160 mg), and placebo were given once daily for 7 days. Inhaled salbutamol was administered at peak drug levels in cumulative doses of 12.5 to 800 micrograms on day 5 and in a single dose of 400 micrograms on day 7. On day 5, salbutamol induced significant increases in SGAW in each treatment group. SGAW increased after the single dose of salbutamol on day 7 in all groups and then declined steadily. The highest values were found after placebo and metoprolol OROS, with smaller increases after SR metoprolol, atenolol, and LA propranolol, the latter showing the smallest increase. Therefore, it would appear that under steady-state conditions, beta 2-bronchial receptors are least blocked by metoprolol OROS, followed by SR metoprolol, atenolol, and LA propranolol.\r"

These infections are difficult to resolve, can lead to peritonitis, and often require removal of the peritoneal catheter. Staphylococcal nasal carriage is the major risk factor for S aureus exit-site infections and peritonitis episodes. In the future, the identification of patients who are S aureus nasal carriers and then treatment of the carriage state with rifampin may prove to be a means of decreasing infection rates. The best treatment for S aureus exit-site and tunnel infections has not been established. Treatment regimens in general use include oral antibiotics or intraperitoneal vancomycin. The optimal length of therapy is also unclear. Since the development of the disconnect peritoneal dialysis system, S aureus, rather than the Staphylococcus epidermidis, is the leading cause of peritonitis. To further decrease peritonitis rates, attention must now be directed at catheter-related peritonitis episodes, with S aureus the most common cause of such episodes. Controlled, prospective studies designed to investigate methods of preventing and treating S aureus exit-site infections in peritoneal dialysis patients are needed.\r"

However, there are no reports of the efficacy of antimony versus placebo or of the efficacy of any alternative therapy versus either antimony or placebo. In the present report, the oral antifungal agent ketoconazole (600 mg/day for 28 days) was compared to a recommended regimen of intramuscular Pentostam (20 mg antimony/kg, with a maximum of 850 mg antimony/day, for 20 days) in a randomized study of the treatment of Panamanian cutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmania braziliensis panamensis. A separate group of patients with this disease was administered placebo. RESULTS: Ketoconazole clinically cured 16 of 21 (76%) patients. The lesions on nine patients healed by 1 month after therapy, and the lesions healed by 3 months after therapy on the other seven patients. Side effects were limited to a 27% incidence of mild, reversible hepatocellular enzyme elevation and an asymptomatic, reversible, approximately 70% decrease in serum testosterone in all patients. Pentostam cured 13 of 19 (68%) patients; the lesions on seven patients healed by the end of therapy, and the lesions on four other patients healed by 1 month after the end of therapy. Side effects were a 47% incidence of mild, reversible hepatocellular enzyme elevation and the morbidity due to 20 intramuscular injections in almost all patients. The placebo group of 11 patients had a 0% cure rate. By 1 month after therapy, all placebo-treated patients demonstrated new lesions or one lesion that was 23% to 875% larger than before therapy. CONCLUSION: Both ketoconazole and Pentostam were more effective than placebo against L. braziliensis panamensis cutaneous leishmaniasis. Oral ketoconazole is comparable in efficacy to this parenteral Pentostam regimen and can be recommended as initial treatment for this disease.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with rheumatoid arthritis from five rheumatology care settings were studied. The patients had initial hematocrits of 34% or less and stable clinical status, and were not being treated with second-line drugs or corticosteroids. An 8-week randomized double-blind study involving various dosages of recombinant erythropoietin, as well as placebo, was followed by a 24-week open-label study in which dosage could be titrated to achieve a normal hematocrit. RESULTS: In the 8-week randomized study, four of 13 patients who received injections of recombinant erythropoietin showed a hematologic response, arbitrarily defined as at least a 6-unit increase in hematocrit. None of four placebo-treated patients showed a meaningful hematologic response. All 11 patients who completed the subsequent 24-week open-label study reached a normal hematocrit level at some time during the study, and 10 of 11 showed an increase of hematocrit 6 units or greater. At least one adjustment, i.e., an increase, decrease, or omission of the erythropoietin dosage, was required in all patients to maintain the hematocrit at a target range of 35% for women or 40% for men. Meaningful changes were not seen in patients' capacity to perform activities of daily living or pain levels during either the 8-week randomized study or the 24-week open-label study. No adverse effects were associated with recombinant erythropoietin therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed excellent hematologic responses to recombinant erythropoietin, without toxicity, during careful monitoring for appropriate dosage adjustment, although a meaningful change in rheumatologic clinical status was not seen.\r"

More than nine million Americans were using OTC diet aids in 1981, making PPA the fifth most used drug in the United States, responsible for over $200 million in revenues. The safety of PPA remains controversial. Although most controlled studies indicate minimal pressor effects with recommended doses, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) continue to be documented. Since 1965, 142 ADRs have been reported in 85 studies, 69% of these in North America. Many such cases may go unrecognized. About two thirds of all ADRs occurred in females and in patients under 30. Of ADRs attributed to legitimately sold PPA products, 85% occurred after consumption of OTC products versus only 15% after prescription drugs. The PPA product often contained combination ingredients, or PPA was consumed along with additional drugs. An overdose of PPA was taken in about a third of the cases. After ingestion of non-overdose amounts, 82% of the ADRs were severe. The most frequent side effects involved symptoms compatible with acute hypertension, with severe headache the most common complaint. Twenty-four intracranial hemorrhages, eight seizures, and eight deaths (most due to stroke) were associated with PPA ingestion. We have summarized these data in an effort to alert clinicians to the prevalence of usage of PPA products and the potential for adverse effects. In patients who present with elevated blood pressure or signs of acute hypertension, especially hypertensive encephalopathy of undetermined origin, we recommend inquiry about recent ingestion of PPA-containing diet aids and cough/cold products and suggest having such patients remain upright rather than supine.\r"

The appearance of the disease is characterized by microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria in Asians, whereas gross hematuria is more frequent in American and European patients. At the time of renal biopsy, fixed microscopic hematuria is detected in a high percentage of patients in Asia and Europe, whereas macroscopic hematuria is more frequent in American patients. Mild renal lesions occur more frequently in Asian patients, while severe renal lesions and a high frequency of immunoglobulin and complement deposits are present in American and European patients. Differences encountered in this retrospective analysis may be influenced by two important factors: (1) the absence of urinalysis screening programs in the schools of Europe and North America, and (2) the different approaches to renal biopsy in the eastern and western parts of the world. Due to the high rate of renal insufficiency and end-stage kidney disease in European and North American patients with IgA nephropathy, it is recommended that a program of urinalysis screening in schools and an appropriate renal biopsy policy be adopted in the western areas of the world.\r"

Average annual mortality rates per million person years were 12 for males, four for females, 30 for Hispanics, six for White non-Hispanics, Blacks and Asians. Seventy-one percent of drivers and 60 percent of passengers had a blood alcohol concentration greater than or equal to 22 mmol/L. Most cases (57 percent) had an Injury Severity Score of 1 (minor injury) or 0 (no injury). Alcohol use was associated with higher Injury Severity Scores. Road curvature of 20 degrees or greater was far more common at crash sites than at matched control sites one mile away (OR = 6.57, 95% CI = 2.93, 14.71). Guard rail placement along highly curved sections of roadway may be an effective preventive measure.\r"

One hundred five families were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study groups (control, bed-net, or curtain). All participants were cured of parasitemia with pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine. Selective epidemiologic and entomologic parameters were measured weekly, while knowledge, attitude, and practices surveys were conducted at the beginning and end of the 15 week study. Plasmodium falciparum infections per person week at risk were significantly higher in the control group than in either the curtain group (5.42 vs. 2.35 cases/100 person weeks risk) or the bed-net group (5.42 vs. 3.77 cases/100 person weeks risk). The curtain group had fewer infections per person week at risk than the bed-net group (2.35 vs. 3.77 cases/100 person weeks risk). A difference was found in clinical malaria among the groups: 45% of persons in the bed-net and curtain groups vs. 30% of those in the control group reported no episodes of fever and chills (chi 2, P less than 0.05). Indoor resting Anopheles gambiae or An. funestus were found on 94 occasions in the control houses, but only twice in the treated houses during weekly visits to each house over the study period (chi 2 P less than 0.001). The pyrethrum knockdown method produced similar results with a total of 195, 23, and 3 An. gambiae and An. funestus collected in the control, bed-net, and curtain houses during the same period, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The LD50s of European and Africanized bee venom by iv injection in mice were similar. In venom neutralization experiments, Africanized bee venom was mixed with antibodies from a beekeeper exposed only to European bees and used to challenge mice. Survival times of mice given these mixtures were significantly prolonged, indicating that human serum antibodies to European bee venom neutralized the lethal effects of Africanized bee venom. Reservoirs from Africanized bees contained less venom than European bees (94 and 147 micrograms venom/bee, respectively) and Africanized bee venom had a lower melittin content. The IEF patterns of venom from individual European bees varied considerably, as did IEF patterns of individual Africanized bees. Pools of venom from 1,000 bees of each population of A. mellifera showed noticeable but less obvious electrophoretic differences. The findings suggest that multiple stinging, and not increased venom potency or delivery, is the cause of serious reactions from Africanized bee attacks.\r"

We reviewed the courses of 16 patients presenting with this problem to determine the causative factors and the most appropriate management of this therapeutic dilemma. Diabetes mellitus (11 of 16, 68.7%) and wound infection (12 of 16, 75%) were frequent pre-existing conditions associated with exposed venous grafts. All patients with exposed vein grafts were initially treated conservatively with regular application of moist sterile dressings, followed by split-thickness skin graft coverage of the wounds when clean. The wounds healed in 7 patients, whereas 9 patients developed complications of hemorrhage (7 patients) and graft thrombosis (2 patients). The outcome of therapy was highly dependent on the type of organism originally cultured from the wounds. The incidence of vein graft disruption was lowest when the wounds were sterile (25%) or when gram-positive bacteria grew (25%). Gram-negative infection uniformly resulted in disruption of the exposed venous graft. When a new graft was placed, the secondary graft became reinfected in all patients with gram-negative primary graft infection. There were no instances of secondary graft reinfection when gram-negative bacteria were not present. These data suggest that the outcome of patients presenting with exposed vein grafts is highly dependent on the bacterial flora of the process. Vein graft disruption is frequent in patients with gram-negative infection, suggesting that these patients should be treated with distant graft ligation and extra-anatomic bypass. By contrast, patients without gram-negative infection may be successfully managed with local wound care.\r"

  ".W": "The accepted approach to patients with intermittent calf claudication is nonoperative unless the symptoms are truly incapacitating, in which case arteriography and either percutaneous angioplasty or operation is indicated. Arteriography is considered a preoperative procedure. However, with improvements in percutaneous angioplasty, we have altered our approach to those patients with limiting, but not incapacitating, claudication. These patients are given the choice of conservative treatment or percutaneous angioplasty, but not operation. In an attempt to limit arteriography to only those patients who would benefit from angioplasty, we have employed color Doppler imaging as a screening technique. Over a 2-year period, 62 patients with limiting claudication were evaluated with color Doppler imaging. Thirty-six patients had long occlusions and did not undergo arteriography since they were not believed to be candidates for percutaneous angioplasty. Three short (less than 5 cm) occlusions and 23 localized stenoses were identified in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Angiography confirmed the Doppler findings in all 26 cases. In 24 patients, dilatation was successful, whereas 2 patients' arteries could not be dilated. Two stenoses recurred early and were redilated. There were no complications from the angioplasties. We conclude that in the subset of patients with limiting, but not incapacitating, claudication, color Doppler imaging can accurately select those patients who will benefit from angioplasty. In this way, patients can be spared unnecessary angiograms.\r"

Two hundred and forty-eight patients (82%) were asymptomatic, while 32 patients (11%) had ruptured aneurysms. During this period, 15 patients (5%) presented with distal embolization as the first manifestation of their AAA. The preoperative embolic event resulted in limb-threatening ischemia in 3 patients, digital ischemia in 11, and calf myonecrosis in 1. CT scan was performed in 14 of 15 patients demonstrating irregular, heterogeneous thrombus within the AAA. Only two of the AAAs were larger than 5 cm. Angiography demonstrated occlusive lesions but was not diagnostic for AAA in seven patients and resulted in three episodes of embolization. AAA was repaired with a tube graft in 4 patients while a bifurcated graft was required in 11 patients for aneurysmal (in 4 patients) and occlusive disease (in 7 patients) of the iliac arteries. All cases employed a transperitoneal approach, systemic heparin, and distal occlusion prior to aortic clamping. Complications included three major (below-knee) and five minor amputations, developing or worsening renal failure in five patients (33%), and death in two (13%). In comparison, mortality was 5% for elective repair and 66% for rupture during this same period. CT scan was safer and more informative than angiography. The morbidity of patients with AAA presenting with emboli is comparable with rupture. The risk of embolization does not correlate with size and indicates the potentially dangerous nature of small AAAs.\r"

Immediately following delivery, parturients having undergone cesarean section with epidural anesthesia with carbonated lidocaine (Xylocaine CO2, Astra, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) with 1:200,000 epinephrine were sequentially randomized to receive either EM or im opioids for postoperative analgesia. One blood sample was collected for viral serology and two mouthwashes (day 0 and 2) were collected to determine oral viral shedding. The patients were observed daily for 5 days. Coldsores were cultured for herpes simplex virus (HSV). Of 187 patients, 96 received EM and 91 im opioids; herpes labialis occurred in 14 of 96 (14.6%) of the former but in 0 of 91 of the latter (P = 0.0004). All 14 experienced facial pruritus. The two groups were at equal risk for reactivation (seropositivity 64.6% and 62.6%, respectively). Analysis of data for those with positive HSV serology reveals 14 of 62 (22.5%) had EM and herpes labialis compared with 0 of 57 in the im group (P less than 0.0001). The incidence of oral viral shedding was low. Surgical stress, the local anesthetic solution, and epinephrine addition to the local anesthetic were eliminated as confounders. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that EM and a history of herpes labialis in these patients were predictive for reactivating oral HSV.\r"

Not only is the neuroendocrine system operative but monokines and lymphokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF, also play important roles. The discovery of these mediators, along with that of macrophage-derived substances that operate at the local wound level, such as platelet-derived, basic fibroblast, transforming, and epidermal growth factors, coupled with advances in molecular biology portends much for the future. The ability to alter the endocrine response with techniques such as epidural anesthesia, the ability to specifically block certain aspects of the response (e.g., with adrenergic and prostaglandin antagonists), and the ability to synthesize potential beneficial mediators with recombinant DNA techniques (e.g., GH) may allow for modulating the response to decrease debility and complications.\r"

  ".W": "When normal lungs are ventilated with large tidal volumes (VT) and end-inspired pressures (Pei), surfactant is depleted and pulmonary edema develops. Both effects are diminished by positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). We reasoned that ventilatory with large VT-low PEEP would similarly increase edema following acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, we ventilated dogs 1 h after hydrochloric acid (HCl) induced pulmonary edema with a large VT (30 ml/kg) and low PEEP (3 cm H2O) (large VT-low PEEP) and compared their results with dogs ventilated with a smaller VT (15 ml/kg) and 12 cm H2O PEEP (small VT-high PEEP). The small VT was the smallest that maintained eucapnia in our preparation; the large VT was chosen to match Pei and end-inspired lung volume. Pulmonary capillary wedge transmural pressure (Ppwtm) was kept at 8 mm Hg in both groups. Five hours after injury, the median lung wet weight to body weight ratio (WW/BW) was 25 g/kg higher in the large VT-low PEEP group than in the small VT-high PEEP group (p less than 0.05). Venous admixture (Qva/Qt) was similarly greater in the large VT-low PEEP group (49.8 versus 23.5%) (p less than 0.05). We conclude that small VT-high PEEP is a better mode of ventilating acute lung injury than large VT-low PEEP because edema accumulation is less and venous admixture is less. These advantages did not result from differences in Pei, end-inspiratory lung volume, or preload (Ppwtm).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine whether these long-term sequelae of the virus pneumonias are cumulative, mice were infected by aerosol inhalation with Sendai virus, influenza A virus, or Sendai followed 30 days later by influenza virus infection. At 90 days after the initial infection, mice were killed for assay of long-term parenchymal changes as quantitated lung hydroxyproline (Hpr) content, morphometric analysis, and total and differential lavage cell counts. Sendai virus infection did not alter the proliferation of influenza virus in the lungs as quantitated by infectious virus titers on Day 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 of influenza infection. At Day 90, lung Hpr content was cumulative in dual-infected mice, with a concomitant increase in the persistent alveolitis. To determine whether bacterial infections played a similar role in these long-term pulmonary sequelae, mice were infected by aerosol inhalation with either Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae or, during the course of influenza virus infection, superinfected with each of the bacteria. Sixty days after infection with K. pneumoniae alone, lung Hpr levels were significantly increased over those in noninfected control mice. Infection with S. aureus had no effect on the quantitated parameters of long-term lung damage. In influenza-infected mice superinfected with K. pneumoniae, lung Hpr content was significantly increased over that of S. aureus did not elevate any quantitated parameter of lung damage when compared with the virus alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cultures were performed to confirm active or inactive disease. IgG and IgM antibody activity was determined by adding a 1:100 dilution of serum to plates coated with A60 antigen. After addition of peroxidase-conjugated antihuman IgG or IgM and color development, optical density (OD) was determined. A total of 83 patients was studied, taking into account their current disease status and prior history. Using as a cutoff value the mean value +/- 2 SD measured in the negative culture, no TB history group, that is, OD = 0.50 for IgG measurements and 0.43 for IgM measurements, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of IgG measurements were equal to 48, 71, and 50%, respectively. Using IgM measurements, these parameters were equal to 76, 98, and 95%, respectively. Combining the results of IgG and IgM measurements, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were equal to 68, 100, and 100%, respectively.

The rationale for our study was based on the fact that activation of T-cells is dependent upon the T-cell growth factor, interleukin-2, which may be regulated by its receptor, IL-2R. Measurements of circulating sIL-2R might be useful in the immune assessment of certain conditions. This study assessed elevated concentrations of circulating sIL-2R in smokers and in patients with lung cancer. The data show that healthy smokers, as a group, have an elevated level of sIL-2R compared with that in nonsmokers. Significantly higher than normal levels were found among light, moderate, and heavy smokers. Patients with lung cancer (squamous cell carcinoma [SSC] or adenocarcinoma [AC]) also have abnormally high sIL-2R levels. In the SCC group, the highest level of sIL-2R was among asymptomatic patients with well-differentiated tumors. Similarly, patients with SCC whose tumors were less than 3 cm in diameter had a significantly higher mean level of sIL-2R than did patients whose tumors exceeded 3 cm. The sIL-2R level in the SCC group also correlated with the tumor stage, with the highest level found among Stage I patients. In patients with SCC, but not in those with AC, the sIL-2R level was indicative of the extent of malignancy. These data support the concept that sIL-2R may be important in the pathogenesis of immune alterations associated with smoking and lung cancer.\r"

  ".U": "90343160\r", 
  ".W": "Over the past decade, it has become increasingly recognized that airways inflammation is one of the major components of asthma. Until recently, measurements of bronchial responsiveness and mediators of allergic reactions were the only methods of studying pathogenetic mechanisms in asthma. With improved diagnostic procedures such as fiberoptic bronchoscopy, it has become possible to investigate these mechanisms and the resulting inflammatory changes in situ. BAL has highlighted the presence of mast cells and eosinophils and has given proof of their mediator participation in airways inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. Endobronchial biopsies have so far yielded results that are similar to those obtained from postmortem studies, although it appears that there are varying degrees of inflammation in living asthmatics. Even in mild disease, the histopathologic features of bronchial asthma are consistent with chronic inflammation. Indirect evidence obtained from allergen challenge leading to increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness during LAR, and direct evidence of inflammatory cells and their mediators in the airway mucosa and lumen after allergen challenge argue for an active role of cells in bringing about inflammatory changes. At present, however, it is not possible to relate precisely the findings obtained by bronchoscopy to the clinical presentation and progression of asthma. Cell activation with production of potent mediators of inflammation may be more relevant to inflammation than the simple presence of these cells in the airways. Almost all the inflammatory cells present in the bronchial wall and lumen have been implicated in the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammation in asthma, but with our current state of knowledge, none can be singled out as the most important contributor. The mast cell was the first to be investigated in depth, and despite the accumulation of large amounts of data concerning its ultrastructure and function, it remains uncertain to what extent this cell is involved in inflammatory responses. Thus, while its main role appears to be that of initiator of allergen-induced responses, the eosinophil has attracted more attention as a proinflammatory cell rather than as an antiinflammatory cell with a capacity to be selectively recruited from the circulation in response to IgE-dependent signals. The eosinophil secretes potent mediators that cause damage to the bronchial epithelium and lead to bronchoconstriction. The role of other cells is at present not as well defined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To realize its full potential in the diagnosis and management of diseases involving the lower respiratory tract, there is a great need for standardization of the technical aspects of BAL as well as processing and analysis of the BAL cellular- and fluid-phase components. Despite these hurdles, BAL has been found to be diagnostic in several infectious and noninfectious diseases involving the lower respiratory tract, and it provides valuable information that may be helpful in characterizing the prognosis and response to therapy in certain interstitial diseases of the lung. It is expected that with future research, in particular long-term prospective epidemiologic and clinical studies in pneumoconioses and in other interstitial lung disease, BAL will prove more valuable in the diagnosis and management of such disease.\r"

Without screening, a 50-year-old person at average risk has approximately a 530-in-10,000 chance of developing invasive colorectal cancer in the rest of his or her life and approximately a 250-in-10,000 chance of dying from it. Analysis of indirect evidence with a mathematic model indicates that screening persons for 25 years, from the age of 50 to the age of 75 years should reduce the chance of developing or dying from colorectal cancer by 10% to 75%, depending on which screening tests are used and how often screening is done. Screening for colorectal cancer is optional. A possible recommendation is that annual fecal occult blood tests and 65-cm flexible sigmoidoscopy every 3 to 5 years be done for average-risk men and women who are between 50 and 75 years of age. In addition to having annual fecal occult blood tests, persons with first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer can be offered barium enemas instead of sigmoidoscopies every 3 to 5 years.\r"

When there is no evidence of sellar involvement, the tumor most likely arises along the path of the craniopharyngeal duct. According to the neurosurgical literature, the optimal treatment consists of total surgical excision. Incomplete tumor removal is supplemented by adjunctive radiotherapy, which has been shown to significantly increase the survival rate. A patient with craniopharyngioma of the nasopharynx and paranasal sinuses who presented with nasal obstruction is reported. Radiographic studies were employed for tumor evaluation, and biopsy was done to establish the histopathologic diagnosis. Treatment included a combination of surgical excision and irradiation.\r"

Two kinds of experimental otitis media were used: serous otitis media (SOM) produced by eustachian tube obstruction and purulent otitis media (POM) produced by inoculation with Streptococcus pneumoniae type 7F. Normal mucosa showed no leakage of HRP. In SOM, vessels were dilated and tortuous, but they did not show HRP leakage. In POM, vessel leakage of HRP was extensive. Biochemically, we measured the middle ear effusion-to-serum ratio of both albumin and alpha 2-macroglobulin by an immunodiffusion method. The ratios of the two marker proteins for vascular permeability were significantly higher in POM than in SOM. This suggests that POM increases vascular permeability to a higher degree than SOM, and morphologic findings in the middle ear mucosa correlate with the biochemical composition of the middle ear effusion.\r"

As oncocytes divide, their pathologic metabolic activity and mitochondrial phenotype are passed on to their progeny, and these cells produce salivary lesions that range from focal oncocytic metaplasia and hyperplasias to benign and malignant neoplasms--oncocytomas and oncocytic carcinomas.\r"

Among these, the most common is atopic dermatitis, and the inciting agent is most often herpes simplex virus (HSV). Very few reports of ocular herpetic disease exist among the many cases of KVE reported in the literature, despite extensive cutaneous involvement with herpetic lesions. We describe 10 patients with KVE, none of whom have developed evidence of herpetic ocular disease despite widespread facial involvement in all patients. All random conjunctival swab cultures performed in 3 patients were positive for growth of viable HSV. Although ocular exposure to HSV may commonly occur in KVE, ocular pathology due to this virus does not appear to be a common sequela.\r"

  ".U": "90343526\r", 
  ".W": "Correction of a coarctation of the aorta, an apparent simple cause of hypertension, paradoxically can provoke two hypertensive responses, one of which is potentially fatal. The first, limited to the first 24 hours, occurs in nearly one half of the patients. This is likely due to the high set of the carotid baroreceptors. The second, which may be associated with abdominal pain and, in some, with necrosis of the small bowel as a result of severe arteritis confined to arteries arising from the aorta below the coarctation, develops in about one half of the first responders. Norepinephrine excretion greatly increases for several days, whereas angiotensin levels are elevated for 3 to 4 days. The hypertension responds to beta-blockers, to arterial smooth muscle relaxants, and to angiotensin converting enzymes. A theory is advanced to explain the second response. It is the adaptation gone awry that ensures adequate flow to exercising muscles below the coarctation, above and beyond that delivered by increasing the systolic pressure. It could be a regionally controlled mechanism similar to the rationing of blood flow in diving mammals.\r"

This review was designed to identify studies providing information on the effects of fever and of pharmacologic and physical therapy. Fever or analogous behavioral thermal upregulation apparently has positive effects on defense against infection in some animal models. Retrospective studies in humans suggest that failure to mount a febrile response is associated with poor outcome in certain infections but do not establish a causal relationship. Induction of fever apparently had therapeutic value in infections such as syphilis before specific antimicrobials were developed. Fever may have deleterious effects in the context of borderline cardiovascular or neurologic function or pregnancy, but data in most instances cannot separate effects of fever per se from that of underlying disease. Antipyretic drugs are effective in diminishing fever, but they have significant side effects and may suppress signs of ongoing infection. Physical cooling is important when physiologic thermoregulatory mechanisms are overwhelmed, but may sometimes increase discomfort and metabolic stress in fever. Antipyretic therapy should not be instituted routinely for every febrile episode but should be based on evaluation of relative risks in the individual case and reassessed if anticipated benefits are not achieved.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of embolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation is largely related to the underlying disorders responsible for the arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation associated with rheumatic mitral valve disease has the highest stroke risk (about 17 times greater than unaffected controls), but even with nonvalvular heart disease, the risk is increased fivefold. The stroke risk is greater with chronic than with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, is highest in the year after onset of the arrhythmia, and is lower in younger patients with idiopathic (\"lone\") atrial fibrillation. Major bleeding episodes, the most important risk of anticoagulation, occur in about 5% to 10% of patients. The decision to anticoagulate a patient with atrial fibrillation depends on the cause of the arrhythmia, especially any associated cardiovascular disease, and the individual's risk from anticoagulation. Growing evidence supports the effectiveness of anticoagulation of most patients with nonvalvular, as well as valvular, cardiac disease for the prevention of both primary and recurrent strokes.\r"

We reviewed all cases in which a test for group A streptococcal pharyngitis was performed during the last 7 months of culture diagnosis and the first 7 months of antigen test diagnosis at an inner city community health center, recording culture or antigen test results, whether antibiotics were prescribed, and patient status (as regular health center patients or patients referred to the center). Positive rates for culture and antigen-test periods were similar (10% and 12%), but 53% of patients with negative culture were treated, where only 32% of patients with negative antigen-test results received prescriptions. Significant reductions in the treatment of patients with negative test results were found in both patient-status subpopulations: health center patients, 43% to 29%; referred patients, 91% to 52%. Among health center patients reductions were consistent for both adult (30% to 21%) and child and adolescent (55% to 45%) age groups. For all patients with negative test results, direct costs of diagnostic reagents and antibiotic prescriptions fell from $3.58 per patient with culture to $3.45 with antigen testing; the $0.13 savings per patient was due to less treatment of referred patients. Thus, rapid antigen testing led to (1) significantly fewer patients with negative test results receiving antibiotic prescriptions; and, (2) savings in antibiotic costs offsetting reagent cost of antigen detection diagnosis.\r"

A total of 394 patients were randomized to one of the three therapies. Mean blood pressures during a 2- to 4-week placebo treatment period (baseline) ranged from 100.4 to 100.7 mm Hg diastolic and 151.7 to 152.5 mm Hg systolic for the three groups. Of the patients, 355 (of whom 345 had assessable data) completed the first treatment period, which consisted of therapy with either 50 mg/d of atenolol, 25 mg every 12 hours of captopril, or 240 mg/d of verapamil sustained release. During the second 4-week treatment period, which 319 patients completed (307 assessable), half of the patients had their antihypertensive medication increased and the other half continued the same dose. Goal blood pressure was defined as a supine diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or a 10-mm Hg or greater drop in supine diastolic blood pressure from pretreatment levels. Atenolol, captopril, and verapamil sustained release therapy was associated with goal blood pressure achievement during the first treatment period 55.1%, 43.8%, and 65.2% of the time, respectively, and during the second treatment period 59.6%, 57.1%, and 73.0% of the time.

  ".W": "A multicenter, randomized double-blind clinical trial was conducted among 306 black men and women with mild to moderate hypertension to determine effects of atenolol, captopril, and verapamil SR on measures of quality of life. Patients were randomly assigned to a stable or forced-dose titration sequence. After an 8-week treatment period, the rate of withdrawal from treatment because of adverse effects was low and did not differ by drug treatment group or titration level. Patients taking verapamil SR showed a significantly greater reduction in mean blood pressures than patients treated with atenolol or captopril. Along with absence of worsening on any quality of life total scale scores examined over the treatment period, we found either improvement or no change in the total scale scores for all three treatment groups. Among both male and female patients, comparisons between drug treatment groups showed no differences in degree of change on the total scale scores. In comparisons within each treatment group, improvement in scores of male patients after 8 weeks appeared among those taking atenolol in general well-being and physical symptoms reduction; among male patients taking captopril in general well-being, physical symptoms, and sexual performance; and among male patients receiving verapamil SR in scores in irritability, sleep, and the Digit Span test. Improvement in scores among female patients taking atenolol was found in scores on general well-being, physical symptoms, and sleep; among women taking captopril on general well-being, physical symptoms, and irritability; and among women taking verapamil SR on general well-being. Patients in all treatment groups improved on measures of visuomotor functioning. The research shows that with the three newer generation antihypertensive medications studied, blood pressure control was achieved during the treatment period without negative effects on quality of life scales, along with findings of improvement on some measures. Given the special clinical features of hypertension in black patients, the study underlines as well the potential and utility of systematic tracking of measures of quality of life, while monitoring blood pressures in this patient population.\r"

Designed as a preliminary examination of the management problems faced by the national medical universities, the conference covered content similar to that of the AAMC Executive Development Seminars, including governance, financial management, faculty practice plans, technology transfer, information management, and organizational diagnosis. China's national medical universities are strategically managed by the Ministry of Public Health in Beijing, and for several years the ministry has increasingly decentralized the management and operational planning and control of these universities. The universities do not have enough properly trained personnel to absorb the additional management responsibilities, and the university presidents feel that they and their senior staffs need extensive training in adapting western-style management principles and practice to the Chinese setting.\r"

Long-term follow-up demonstrated that despite treatment, approximately 20% of borderline hypertensive patients became stable hypertensive within 12 years. Preliminary data on reinvestigation of these patients indicated that their dopaminergic indices also changed from those typical of borderline hypertension to those characteristic of stable hypertension, a finding compatible with the hypothesis that the hyperdopaminergic patterns in borderline hypertension represent an early antihypertensive defense response which progressively fails in patients who go on to develop stable hypertension.\r"

This action was blocked by metoclopramide as well as by either of two cyclooxygenase (CO) blockers, but effects were not altered by administration of the alpha 1 blocker prazosin. Much of the effect of dopamine (DA) is apparently via the DA1 receptor, since fenoldopam (0.1 microgram/min/kg) reproduced these actions. However, although fenoldopam increased glomerular filtration rate and urinary Na+, CO blockers were without effect. In contrast neither DA or fenoldopam infusions changed either renal blood flow or PGI2 in a group of patients with essential hypertension. Renin secretion was shown to be increased via DA1 receptor activation both in humans and rat renal tissue. The DA2 receptor may also play a role since domperidone can reduce renal blood flow.\r"

At higher doses, fenoldopam lowers blood pressure but still maintains renal perfusion. In addition to its renal vasodilator activity, fenoldopam is natriuretic, possibly resulting from a direct effect of DA1 receptors on the proximal convoluted tubule.

Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that it is a potent renal vasodilator as well as a peripheral vasodilator. In both normal volunteers and hypertensive patients intravenous fenoldopam causes dose-related decreases in blood pressure and important increases in renal hemodynamics and function including increased renal blood flow, diuresis and natriuresis. Fenoldopam does not alter glomerular filtration. Intravenous fenoldopam has been demonstrated to be efficacious in severe hypertensive patients in several multicenter, multinational trials. In severe hypertension efficacy trials fenoldopam was judged to be as effective as sodium nitroprusside and to produce less serious side effects. In patients with moderate to severe heart failure, fenoldopam has been demonstrated to produce dose-related acute increases in cardiac output, stroke volume and work index, decreased systemic vascular resistance but no important changes in pulmonary wedge pressure or right atrial pressure. In CHF patients fenoldopam has been demonstrated to be as efficacious as sodium nitroprusside. Fenoldopam, as a specific (DA1) agonist resulting in decreased peripheral and renal vascular resistance, diuresis, natriuresis and increases in cardiac hemodynamics on intravenous administration, appears to be an efficacious agent which offers a reasonable alternative in the treatment of severe hypertension and acute congestive heart failure.\r"

Cumulative experience with the dog in vivo models suggests that the potency order: fenoldopam greater than dopamine greater than dipropyl dopamine greater than apomorphine characterizes the DA1 receptor while the reverse order: apomorphine greater than dipropyl dopamine greater than or equal to dopamine much greater than fenoldopam distinguishes the DA2 subtype. SCH 23390 for the DA1 and domperidone and (S)-sulpiride for the DA2, as selective antagonists, clearly identify the two subtypes. Increase in cyclic AMP after DA1 activation and decrease after DA2 occupancy have been reported. However, how both increase and decrease in cyclic AMP transduce vascular relaxation remains to be explained. DA1 and DA2 agonist activities of two new structures, CY 208,243 (Sandoz) and dihydrexidine, are reported in this chapter. Addition of benzene to ergoline and benzoquinoline moieties rendered these molecules inactive on the DA2 receptor while bestowing DA1 agonist activity on these otherwise inactive molecules and even obviated the need for two OH groups for DA1 activity. It would appear that the current views on structural requirements for DA1 and DA2 agonist activities will require revision and reexamination.\r"

Moreover, 3H-SCH 23390 binding sites were not sensitive to chemical sympathectomy, suggesting postjunctional localization of DA-1 receptors. 3H-Spiroperidol (DA-2 ligand) was bound primarily by the adventitial, the adventitial-medial border as well as by the intimal layer of cerebral, mesenteric and renal arteries. The accumulation of adventitial and adventitial-medial 3H-spiroperidol binding sites was higher in medium and small sized arteries than in large ones and was remarkably reduced after chemical sympathectomy. These results show prejunctional localization of DA-2 receptors and further suggest that some DA-2 binding sites are located in the arterial intima.\r"

Thus, light microscope immunocytochemistry can be used to screen human tissues for potential dopaminergic inputs, preparatory to functional analysis. Application of this technique has so confirmed the innervation by dopaminergic neurons of human kidney and hepatic vasculature. Although similar nerves are found in kidney and liver of dog, the specific target structures supplied, and therefore the specific functional effects of nerve activation, are different.\r"

  ".W": "Dopamine (DA), a catecholamine produced in the kidney, is a renal vasodilator and natriuretic substance, but its action at dopamine-1 (DA-1), dopamine-2 (DA-2) and alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors limits its effectiveness as a heuristic tool and pharmacologic agent. We have studied the effects of highly selective DA-1 and DA-2 receptor agonists and antagonists in normal human subjects and experimental animals to determine the precise physiological role of renal dopamine at DA-1 and DA-2 receptors within the kidney. We studied fenoldopam, a selective DA-1 agonist, in normal human subjects in metabolic balances at high (300 mEq/day) and low (10 mEq/day) sodium (Na) intake. Selective DA-1 receptor stimulation during high Na intake resulted in renal vasodilation, natriuresis and diuresis in a sustained manner for 3 hours. The natriuresis was mediated by a reduction in Na reabsorption at both proximal and distal tubular sites. In contrast, during low Na intake, DA-1 receptor stimulation did not engender a natriuretic or diuretic response. Thus, sodium depletion may inhibit the function of renal tubular cells in response to DA-1 stimulation. DA-1 receptors are present in the medial layer of the renal vasculature, proximal tubule and cortical collecting duct; DA-2 receptors are localized to the glomerulus, the renal nerves surrounding renal blood vessels and possibly the renal vascular endothelium. We have performed studies in conscious dogs with indwelling renal arterial catheters to identify the physiological role of renal DA to DA-1 and DA-2 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the functional significance of these renal dopamine containing nerves in relation to renal dopamine receptors is unknown. The functional significance could be defined by demonstrating that an alteration in one or more renal functions occurring in response to reflex or electrical activation of efferent renal nerves is dependent on release of dopamine as the neurotransmitter from the renal nerve terminals acting on renal dopamine receptors. Thus, the hypothesis becomes: reflex or electrical activation of efferent renal nerves causes alterations in renal function (eg, renal blood flow, water and solute handling) that are inhibited by specific and selective dopamine receptor antagonists. As reviewed herein, the published experimental data do not support the hypothesis. Therefore, the view that alterations in one or more renal functions occurring in response to reflex or electrical activation of efferent renal nerves are dependent on release of dopamine as the neurotransmitter from the renal nerve terminals acting on renal dopamine receptors remains unproven.\r"

  ".W": "Significant proximal tubular responses to exogenous dopamine require 0.1 to 10 mumol/L concentrations but endogenous peritubular dopamine and DOPA concentrations are in the picomolar to nanomolar range. Dopamine concentration approaches micromolar levels within proximal tubular cells and their brush borders, as a result of DOPA decarboxylation and secretion, and in collecting duct fluid, as a result of tubular fluid absorption. Thus dopamine probably acts either within the proximal tubule cell or brush border or from the collecting tubular lumen. DOPA and Na+ uptake are coupled; dopamine uptake is linked to intracellular electrical potential and its secretion to H+ counter-transport; therefore alterations in proximal tubular Na+ and H+ transport influence dopamine excretion. Haloperidol and SCH 23390 block dopamine excretion, therefore dopamine antagonists may inhibit tubular dopamine responses by lowering intracellular dopamine concentration as well as by receptor blockade. Evidence for an intracellular site of dopamine action can be deduced from the inhibitory effect of DOPA on oxygen consumption and 86Rb uptake in proximal tubule cells. We have confirmed these findings in isolated proximal tubule cells but not in proximal tubule fragments. The discrepant responses may be due to the fact that isolated cells loose their polarity while tubule fragments remain polarized. Dopamine inhibition of proximal tubular Na+, K(+)-ATPase is not reproduced by single dopamine agonists or inhibited by dopamine antagonists. Dopamine effects which are not linked to known dopamine receptors may be the result of redox cycling. Micromolar dopamine oxidizes sulfhydryl groups which may modify enzyme structure and activate protein kinase C.\r"

Within two weeks, a significant increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and a rise in the filtration fraction were observed as described in the early stage of diabetic nephropathy. Increase in both GFR and in the filtration fraction were normalized by treating the rats with L-dopa (10 mg/kg, subcutaneously, twice a day for one week). The effects of L-dopa were linked to endorenal DA synthesis and to DA-1 receptor stimulation since both carbidopa and SCH 23390 suppressed them.\r"

In studies with dopamine antagonists and in measurements of urinary free dopamine excretion no evidence was found for increased endogenous renal dopamine generation in these patients.

We have reported that two different DA receptors are present in rat adrenal glomerulosa: D-1, associated with stimulation of adenylate cyclase, and D-2, coupled in an inhibitory way with the cyclic AMP (cAMP) generating system. By measuring aldosterone secretion and cAMP formation in intact adrenal glomerulosa cells, we also found a specific functional interaction between D-2 receptors apparently associated with inhibition of cAMP formation and AII in the regulation of aldosterone production.\r"

Persistent drainage and recurrent infection after mastoid surgery hallmark failure at achieving these goals. Medical management consisting of meticulous aural toilette and attention to accompanying medical disorders will often yield resolution; however, a significant number of patients will still require surgical revision. While intact canal wall procedures have reduced the chronic difficulties associated with open cavities, they are prone to failure. Careful assessment of the disease process and development of a surgical approach that is both flexible and complete will maximize success in revision surgery. Disease persistence after revision should be considered in the spectrum of complications, even though at times it is nearly impossible to avoid. We describe the reasons for failure of mastoid procedures, common areas of retained disease, and review key concepts of revision.\r"

  ".U": "90344189\r", 
  ".W": "Although microvascular anastomoses are routinely performed with nonabsorbable sutures, a foreign body reaction can be stimulated that acts as a nidus for inflammation, infection, and possible thrombosis. Absorbable sutures should be able to diminish this reaction. There are sparse data describing the use of absorbable sutures for both arterial and venous anastomoses. This investigation compares standard microvascular anastomotic technique using nonabsorbable 10-0 sutures (nylon) with absorbable 10-0 sutures (polyglactin 910), using a previously reported tubed superficial epigastric flap model in rats. Patency rates and histologic responses are compared at intervals of 3 days and 1, 2, 8 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Arterial and venous patency rates were similar for both materials (overall nonabsorbable, 85.9%; overall absorbable, 84.4%). A somewhat increased inflammatory response was noted in the arterial absorbable group at 1 week and in both the venous and arterial nonabsorbable groups at 8 and 12 weeks postoperatively. The later finding most probably represents the continued presence of the nylon sutures. The incidence of intraluminal thrombosis was greater for nonabsorbable suture, occurring in two arterial and four venous anastomoses, compared with only one absorbable suture venous anastomosis. We conclude that nonabsorbable suture is as efficacious as standard absorbable material in both arterial and venous microanastomoses with the potential benefit of diminished foreign body reaction.\r"

A statistically significant age-related loss of myelinated nerve fibers was detected (old, 7032 +/- 1572; young, 10,179 +/- 1969), representing a 31% decrease. Much of this loss occurred selectively in small myelinated fibers (1 to 2 microns) where there was an extensive (67%) and significant age-related fiber loss. A corresponding analysis of axonal diameter of myelinated nerve fibers similarly showed an extensive (67%) and statistically significant decrease in myelinated fibers with small axonal diameters (0 to 0.5 microns) in the old age group compared with the young adult age group. These findings may represent a significant histomorphologic correlate to the observed age-related sensorimotor dysfunction of the upper aerodigestive tract common in the elderly.\r"

In a series of six patients, both techniques produced equally effective palliation of dysphagia without associated morbidity. Theoretically, the anterolateral approach better preserves the carotid sheath neurovascular bundle, although the risk of injuring the recurrent laryngeal nerve is greater. The posterolateral technique offers a wider exposure of the prevertebral space but requires more retraction of the carotid sheath and increases the risk of injury to the sympathetic chain. Either exposure may be used depending on the preference of the attending surgeon.\r"

Mechanisms of myoneurotization have also been described, by which regenerating branches of severed peripheral motor nerves directly reach motor end plates of denervated muscles, with variable recovery of function. A case demonstrating unequivocal clinical evidence of trigeminal-facial cross-innervation is presented, and the pertinent literature is reviewed as it applies to the mechanisms of this phenomenon.\r"

These 27 cases occurred in eight men and 19 women, aged from 34 to 77 years. All but 2 presented with a thyroid mass. Eleven (41%) of the 27 patients experienced local recurrences following surgery, 17 (63%) had development of cervical lymph node metastases, 5 (19%) had development of mediastinal lymph node metastases, 11 (41%) had pulmonary metastases, and 9 (33%) had bone metastases, and 9 (33%) had bone metastases. At least 15 patients (56%) are known to have died of their disease, usually within 8 years of diagnosis. Pathologically, the tumors are distinctive and grow as solid islands (insulae) of small cells separated by artifactually created clefts. In some instances, small follicles are also noted within the insulae. All tumors were positive on immunostaining for thyroglobulin. In view of the propensity for local recurrences and lymphatic and hematogenous dissemination, a total thyroidectomy and neck dissection would seem advisable. Additionally, adjuvant external beam irradiation, systemic chemotherapy, and/or radioactive iodine therapy should also be considered.\r"

We present two infants with profound life-threatening airway malacia treated by endoscopic placement of a self-expanding endobronchial stent. A description of their anomaly, surgical management, and long-term care is included. The expandable stent may obviate the need for complex high-risk surgical procedures and prolonged ventilatory support.\r"
