We performed successful retinal endophotocoagulation in the eyes of Dutch-belted rabbits, using high-power phased-array semiconductor lasers, emitting at 808 and 817 nm. The laser itself measured 25 X 30 X 21 mm, was air cooled, and was portable. At a treatment power of 100 mW, uniformly white photocoagulation lesions were seen at exposure durations of 0.2 to 1.0 s. Lesions were similar in appearance to argon laser photocoagulation lesions, as determined by ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography. Thin-section histologic examination of acute lesions revealed injury localized to the outer retina; chorioretinal scar formation was noted ten days after photocoagulation. To our knowledge, this study is the first in which therapeutically useful lesions were produced using a diode laser and demonstrates the feasibility of using these highly efficient and compact laser sources for ophthalmic photocoagulation.\r"

We have studied the rate of kinin degradation by each of these enzymes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), compared with the degradation rate in degenerative joint disease and normal subjects. Carboxypeptidase activity was the same in all individuals, but ACE activity was increased in the RA and SLE patients. We examined the effects of aspirin, sodium salicylate, auranofin, penicillamine, and corticosteroids on kinin metabolism, and all of these were marked inhibitors of ACE; however, only penicillamine had any demonstrable inhibition of carboxypeptidase. These observations suggest rapid degradation of DBK in patients with untreated RA and SLE, whereas drugs utilized in therapy have the opposite effects. Studies to examine the role of DBK in disease manifestations are in progress.\r"

Compared with the controls, statistically significant numbers of patients and their relatives had antihistone antibodies of both isotypes. Among the relatives, the sera from females, notably sisters of the patients, contained the highest levels of anti-total histone antibody. Anti-H2A/H2B and H3 antibodies were most prevalent among the lupus patients, but many of the relatives had IgM anti-H4 antibodies.

Functional outcome differed according to course patterns and the extent of articular involvement. Systemic manifestations, per se, did not contribute to poor functional prognosis. Chronic articular disease had the worst outcome: 27% evolved to functional class III status, compared with none in the cyclic systemic groups. Those patients who had a chronic articular pattern or a polyarticular onset and course were at higher risk to develop disabling arthritis. An aggressive approach to therapy, including the early use of remittive agents, should be considered in these patient subsets.\r"

The initial external symptoms of the joint inflammation were swelling and redness. This was associated with edema of the synovium and periarticular tissues and gross proliferation of cells, which reached a peak during weeks 7-9 of the experiment. Mononuclear cell infiltration, with perivascular concentration and occlusion of small vessels, was common. Synovitis increased in severity, villous pannus developed, and erosions of bone, articular cartilage, and occasionally, growth plate were observed. The lumbar spine and the proximal intervertebral discs of the tail also exhibited inflammatory and degenerative changes. As the arthritis progressed, sometimes with acute inflammatory exacerbations, more joints became involved and, by the sixteenth to the twentieth weeks of the experiment, a progressive polyarthritis, with gross joint deformities and restricted function, developed in the majority of the limb joints. Clinical and morphologic features of the disease correlated well with radiologic analysis and with an increased deposition of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (determined by radionuclide imaging). The development of this arthritis was accompanied by the expression of cell-mediated and humoral immunity to the immunizing antigen. However, this immunity was also observed, although it was generally less well developed, in mice that received the intact or digested proteoglycan without adjuvant. These mice did not usually develop arthritis. Control mice that received only adjuvant did not develop arthritis.\r"

Plasma atropine was assayed by a radioreceptor method. The time to peak plasma concentration of atropine was shortest with intravenous administration; and longest with endotracheal administration. The mean plasma concentration of atropine was significantly higher in intravenous administrations than in endotracheal administrations at 0.75 and 2 minutes; compared to that noted in intraosseous administrations, the concentration was significantly higher only at 0.75 minutes. The mean plasma concentration of atropine administered intraosseously was significantly higher than that of endotracheal administrations at 5 minutes and was greater than that of intravenous and endotracheal administrations for the samples collected from 5 to 30 minutes. The endotracheal and intraosseous routes provide alternatives to the intravenous administration of atropine when intravenous access is limited or not available.\r"

The patients who were successfully managed nonoperatively were younger (mean age, 12 years), had fewer associated injuries (mean ISS, 18), required fewer blood transfusions, and suffered their traumas secondary to falls, sporting events, or altercations. We propose that the injury severity score, the number of units of blood transfused, patient age, as well as the type of trauma suffered be used to predict which patients can be safely managed nonoperatively.\r"

To compare the effects of glycerol and glucose on the transport of fluid and solutes across the peritoneal barrier, a new mathematical method for calculation of intraperitoneal dialysate volumes and diffusive mass transport coefficients (KBD) was developed. Radioisotopically tagged albumin (RISA) was added to the dialysate and the rate of fluid transfer was determined by the dilution principle with corrections applied for elimination of RISA from the peritoneal cavity. The elimination rate of RISA varied between 1 and 2 ml/min. KBD values for urea, creatinine, glucose, glycerol, and total protein were calculated during dialysate isovolemia. Glycerol appeared to increase the peritoneal permeability as indicated by an increased KBD value for total protein. The osmotic effect during the initial part of the dwell was similar to that of glucose, but the duration of effective ultrafiltration was shorter because glycerol was absorbed more rapidly than glucose, and ultrafiltered volumes after 6 h were significantly smaller than with glucose.\r"

We developed this technique in order to expand uses of implantable infusion pump technology in the laboratory. The dog, which has been the research animal of choice in previous studies using implantable pumps, can now be replaced by smaller, less expensive animals for similar or other laboratory purposes. This technique can be of particular importance in the study of atherosclerosis where the dog is a poor model and the rabbit an excellent one. In 18 rabbits with inferior vena cava cannulations, we were able to obtain 100% survival and constant solution delivery for up to and greater than 6 months. This technique is safe and reproducible. By employing a simple catheter modification and using special pump anchoring precautions, we found that we could successfully use a human-sized device in rabbit studies. Commentary is also made concerning the relative contributions to patency and vein sclerosis of catheter diameter and the infusate media.\r"

Most patients in the cyanotic group had oligaemic, while all in the acyanotic group had overperfused, lungs before surgery. Total compliance was similar in the two groups. Alveolar ventilation was higher and the physiological deadspace to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) lower in the acyanotic group compared with the cyanotic group (P less than 0.05) before surgery. In the cyanotic group the preoperative large difference between arterial (PaCO2) and end-tidal (PE' CO2) carbon dioxide tension was smaller immediately after CPB and remained so after closure of the sternum. In the acyanotic children the small arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide difference before CPB had increased just after and 30 min after CPB, and VD/VT was significantly increased (P less than 0.05) just after CPB. After closure of the sternum the arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide difference and the VD/VT ratio had returned to baseline. The arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide difference is a good indicator of ventilatory efficiency after open heart surgery.\r"

When blockade by atracurium exceeded 80%, a significant decrease in latency was recorded (P less than 0.05). There was no significant change in latency after vecuronium. During the onset of blockade, depression of the amplitude of the evoked compound action potential was associated with a prolongation of its duration (P less than 0.05). The mean maximum increase in the negative deflection time was found to be similar after atracurium and after vecuronium. However, this phase was prolonged to a greater extent for a given degree of amplitude depression during the onset of blockade by atracurium (P less than 0.05).\r"

The remaining 10 patients did not receive any neuromuscular blocking drug, and were monitored for 6 min to exclude any time-related changes in the ECAP. Neuromuscular blockade produced a decrease in total power and a shift towards lower frequencies. This was reflected in a decrease in the MPF in those patients receiving atracurium or vecuronium. There was no significant difference (P less than 0.05) between the atracurium and vecuronium groups in the magnitude of the change in MPF. These findings suggest that the previously reported increase in the duration of the negative deflection of the ECAP is predominantly the result of a change in its frequency components.\r"

Patients were disconnected from the ventilator after the reappearance of the tetanic response. This response returned at a mean time of 19.2 min after the injection of alcuronium and oxygenation was maintained thereafter by means of apnoeic diffusion. Spontaneous breathing returned at a mean time of 23.6 min after the injection of alcuronium. Sixty minutes after the administration of alcuronium, respiratory exchange was judged adequate, and at that time neuromuscular function was still markedly depressed with a tetanic height less than 25% of control. It was concluded that, because of the slow recovery of neuromuscular function, alcuronium should be reserved for the longer surgical procedure.\r"

In mice and rats, i.v. bolus doses of laudanosine 10-20 mg kg-1, caused convulsions and hind limb extensions; these effects were prevented by pretreatment with diazepam. After the continuous infusion of laudanosine to conscious dogs, plasma concentrations in the order of 1.2 micrograms ml-1 did not cause behavioural disturbances. In anaesthetized dogs, laudanosine plasma concentrations of more than 6 micrograms ml-1 caused hypotension and bradycardia, laudanosine concentrations greater than 10 micrograms ml-1 induced epileptic EEG spiking and plasma concentrations greater than 17 micrograms ml-1 produced prolonged seizures. There is a wide difference between laudanosine plasma concentrations in patients given atracurium by bolus injection or by short-term infusion for surgical use and those required to induce epileptic activity in dogs. However, during the prolonged infusion of atracurium to patients this difference will be decreased. It is unlikely that the use of atracurium, in patients, would result in plasma concentrations of laudanosine capable of producing neurological or cardiovascular disturbances.\r"

  ".W": "The difficulty of applying conventional concepts of respiratory mechanics to high frequency ventilation (HFV) has so far inhibited its general acceptance by clinicians. The basis of an approach derived from an acoustic analysis of the ventilated patient is presented which may help to clarify the mechanism of action of HFV and offer some guidelines to its clinical application. The ventilator is considered as an acoustic source, and the patient's acoustic response to the ventilator is analysed. A response equation for the patient's respiratory system at low frequencies is derived, from which an expression for the fundamental resonant frequency is obtained. The high frequency acoustic response of the patient is examined with particular reference to the possibility of exciting multiple resonant modes within the airways. Following this, we have discussed the significance of the acoustic response and acoustic resonance in relation to gas exchange. It is suggested that these resonances may be used in adjusting indices of HFV in order to obtain optimum ventilation.\r"

Isoflurane produced significant dose-related changes in the AER: reductions in amplitude and increases in latency of the cortical waves Pa and Nb, and increases in the latency of the brainstem waves III and V. When isoflurane was compared with halothane and enflurane using an MAC-based comparison, we found no differences in the effect of the three agents on the amplitude of the early cortical waves, although the latencies showed significant differences. The consistent dose-related effect on the amplitudes of the cortical waves implies that the AER could be a promising index of the depth of anaesthesia.\r"

Seventy-six percent of the mothers in the infusion group required no or only one top-up. Although the infusion patients received a higher mean dose of bupivacaine (178 mg v. 130 mg), there was no difference between the groups with respect to mode of delivery, need for urinary catheterization, adverse cardiovascular effects on mother or fetus, or the time taken after delivery to recover sensation and motor power. The only real disadvantage was that the infusion group had an increased incidence of lower limb weakness (64% v. 44%). The neonates had similar Apgar scores, times to sustained respiration and requirements for resuscitation. The technique, therefore, should be safe if coupled with testing of sensory level, as no block extended higher than T6.\r"

Enflurane altered synaptic transmission in the in vitro rat hippocampal slice preparation and produced seizure-like burst discharges of CA 1 neurones, at vapour concentrations equivalent to those obtained during anaesthesia (2-6 vol%; 0.5-1.5 mmol litre-1). Burst discharges occurred both spontaneously and in response to stimulation of stratum radiatum fibres in the CA 1 pyramidal region, but not in the dentate area. Low concentrations of enflurane (approx. 0.75 mmol litre-1), decreased the field potential responses of CA 1 neurones; however, dentate granule neurone responses were increased. Input/output analyses of field excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) and population spike amplitudes revealed that the enflurane-induced depression of field potential responses was associated with decreases in synaptic input, whereas burst activity resulted from a decrease in the threshold of CA 1 neurones.\r"

The actions of these drugs were compared with one another, and with those of a series of amino-ester local anaesthetics studied previously. The results demonstrated that A fibres are the most, and C fibres the least, sensitive to blockade by local anaesthetic agents. As with the ester drugs, equipotent concentrations of the amides blocked C fibres at approximately the same rate, but the absolute and relative rates of development of A fibre blockade were related to lipid solubility. As the latter increased, so did the rate of A fibre blockade. Combining the results of the two studies suggests that an agent of low lipid solubility and high pKa might be used to produce differential C fibre blockade. Comparison of the results obtained with the two different classes of drug indicates that the ester structure may have an inherently more potent action than the amide.\r"

Two psoriatic patients had squamous carcinomas, both of whom had received high cumulative UVA doses and also methotrexate concurrently with PUVA. Six patients with MF had actinic keratoses. The mean age of these patients (69 years) was significantly greater than the mean age of the patients without actinic keratoses (54 years), but there was no significant difference in their cumulative UVA doses. No patients developed basal cell carcinomas or malignant melanoma. 'PUVA lentigines' were found in 46% of the patients. They were most frequent in patients currently being treated and in those who had received high cumulative UVA doses, but persisted for up to 7 years after discontinuing therapy. Seventy-one patients had yearly ophthalmological examinations, or a single examination at least 3 months after commencing PUVA. This examination included retinal function tests to detect any subclinical visual impairment. Five of these patients had cataract prior to PUVA therapy, and were significantly older (mean age 71 years) than those without cataract (mean age 53 years). Three patients (mean age 61 years) developed new lens opacities whilst receiving PUVA. However, none of these patients was considered to have cataract as none had impairment of visual acuity due to lens opacity. No patients without lens opacity developed evidence of subclinical visual impairment.\r"

We conclude that in vitro, psoriatic PMN synthesize more LTB4 from exogenous AA than do PMN of healthy individuals and due to an efficient omega-oxidation system, the net release of LTB4 in both groups appears to be similar.\r"

  ".W": "Application of 1% potassium hydroxide (KOH) reduced subsequent development of anthralin inflammation without loss of its therapeutic effect on psoriasis. Teepol had a similar but smaller effect on subsequent development of inflammation. The action of KOH appears to have resulted from enhanced oxidation of anthralin to inactive products and the action of Teepol to have increased anthralin solubility and removal. The effect of KOH and Teepol decreased with time after anthralin application and both were ineffective by 24 h, indicating that anthralin persists on the skin in an active form for up to 24 h after a single application. The reduction of anthralin inflammation without loss of therapeutic effect is potentially useful in short contact anthralin therapy.\r"

In one subject, vasodilation was detected very shortly after irradiation and may have even begun during irradiation. In the other subject vasodilation was detected later at most exposure doses, but still some time before erythema became visible. We conclude that the so-called 'latent period' between irradiation and appearance of erythema is an artificial concept arising from the insensitivity of the eye.\r"

All the bone changes were asymptomatic. Serum calcium, inorganic phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, calcitonin and parathormone were within normal physiological ranges. In general, the bone changes observed after long-term etretinate treatment closely resembled the effects of isotretinoin on the skeleton.\r"

Bile acid concentrations were measured in sera, urine and suction blister fluid from skin exposed to ultraviolet light before, during and following treatment. The findings suggest that phototherapy reduces cutaneous bile acid levels which can subsequently be maintained by low dose cholestyramine. Routine liver function tests remained unaltered. This combination of phototherapy and cholestyramine may be useful in controlling severe pruritus in primary biliary cirrhosis when the drug alone is not tolerated or is ineffective.\r"

An exploratory laparotomy with appropriate surgery was then performed and the tumours were staged. Tumours were positively imaged 3 min-22 h after injection in all the patients with ovarian cancer, with a mean 0.6% of the injected antibody taken up by the tumour. The presence of HMFG antigen on the tumour was confirmed by immunoperoxidase staining of the surgically-removed tissues. Of the 51 patients, 39 proved to have ovarian cancer. The accuracy of diagnosis and detection of primary and metastatic malignant disease was 95% when correlating pre-operative radioimmune scan findings and laparotomy findings.

  ".W": "The best Snellen visual acuity in the three months after cataract extraction was found to decline with the age of the patient. The relationship was identical in 111 patients who had extracapsular extraction and a Pearce tripod posterior chamber intraocular lens and in 50 patients who had intracapsular extraction with spectacle correction. Vision after operation varied from a mean value of 6/5 at 50 years to 6/12 at 90 years, a decline of 1 line per 13.4 years. In the intracapsular group, over a mean follow-up period of 14 years, the rate of fall in acuity with increasing age after operation was found to be statistically similar to that of the early postoperative acuity plotted against age for both types of operation. This suggests that the rate of decline with age is unchanged after a prolonged period of aphakia with presumed increased exposure to ultraviolet and blue light. The data were found to be similar to the decline in the neurosensory elements of vision with age measured experimentally in 20 phakic subjects by laser interferometry. This method of assessment of contrast sensitivity threshold effectively bypasses changes in the optical media. The findings indicate that the previously recognised drop in visual acuity with age is not related to changes in the aging crystalline lens and support the view that there is a decline in the neurosensory elements of vision. It is important to recognise this deterioration so that results of surgery or other treatment are adjusted to allow for the age of the patients.\r"

Retrodots were found in 47 out of 121 eyes with cataract (39%) in the present series. They show birefringence in vivo and in vitro, and chemical studies suggest that they contain calcium oxalate. It is proposed that ascorbic acid, which is abundant in the normal human lens, is the most likely source for this oxalate. Ascorbic acid is thought to have a protective role against oxidative stress in the lens and other parts of the eye, and its level is known to be reduced in senile cataract. The presence of the retrodots may identify lenses which have been exposed to oxidative stress and are less capable of resisting oxidative damage.\r"

In the groups investigated a lack of autoregulation of the optic nerve head circulation was found in patients with low tension glaucoma only. Patients with anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy showed the same pressure compliance behaviour as healthy subjects.

In comparison with age matched groups of patients on a regimen where streptomycin replaced ethambutol a statistically significant number of the patients on ethambutol had abnormal scores. This study suggests that Arden contrast sensitivity plates would be effective in detecting subclinical toxic optic neuropathy due to ethambutol and therefore could be used for routine monitoring of ocular function of patients on ethambutol. Loss of contrast sensitivity may explain why some patients on ethambutol with normal visual acuity and colour perception may still complain of visual disturbance.\r"

In this situation aqueous humour accumulates behind the iris and forces silicone oil through the pupil into the anterior chamber. An iridectomy at the 6 o'clock position can effectively prevent this pupillary block. The iridectomy allows free passage of aqueous to the anterior chamber which remains free of silicone oil. No permanent contact with silicone oil and the cornea is established, and development of keratopathy is prevented. The effect of this iridectomy in 62 eyes with intact iris diaphragm in patients in Rotterdam (35 cases) and Nagoya (27 cases) is demonstrated. Only in 6.5% of the cases was silicone oil present in the anterior chamber at the end of the follow-up period of 7 months.\r"

The retinal pigment epithelium in the macular area showed a significant increase in lipofuscin granules, most likely because of a reduced capacity for digestion of phagocytosed material, and a significant decrease in melanin and melanolipofuscin granules in comparison with a normal control material. The ophthalmoscopically visible glistening dots and the pigment epithelial 'windows' seen on fluorescein angiography may possibly be explained by a further progression of these changes. No retinal changes were found in the macular area, the midperiphery, or the periphery that could be attributed with certainty to any other origin than post-mortem autolysis. More material would be needed, however, to elucidate further the fundal changes in the Sjogren-Larsson syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Hemopoietic precursors are heterogeneous with respect to their capacity for self-renewal and long-term repopulating ability. Bone marrow cultures produce a variety of precursors over many weeks, including CFU-S; however, it is important to determine whether these populations retain the functional ability shown by fresh marrow. The most primitive precursor or stem cells have the most long-term repopulating ability. We here describe direct measurements of this ability in cells from marrow cultures by using competitive repopulation assays. Cultured adherent cells repeatedly showed less capacity than fresh marrow cells to repopulate erythropoiesis in irradiated recipients, whereas cultured suspension cells consistently had less capacity than adherent cells. Concentrations of macroscopic CFU-S measured at nine or 12 days were similar in cultured adherent and suspension cells and generally lower than those in fresh marrow. In every experiment, the long-term repopulating ability of the marrow cells used was substantially reduced after transfer into tissue culture. Thus, primitive stem cells may not proliferate in such cultures despite extensive production of CFU-S and more differentiated cell types.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work has demonstrated that the HbS gene has appeared and expanded three times in Africa in three separate geographic locations and that these three distinct mutational events can be identified by linked DNA polymorphic sites (haplotypes) surrounding the abnormal gene. We have reported that the Senegalese and Beninian haplotypes differ in G gamma expression, mean percentage of HbF, and percentage of dense cells. We now report on the third haplotype, the Bantu, and find that it has intermediate features, namely, the high mean percentage of HbF and low percentage of dense cells associated with the Senegalese haplotype, but with a low percentage of G gamma expression similar to the Beninian haplotype. The distribution of percent HbF is quite different from Senegal haplotype-bearing sickle cell anemia patients since it covers a much wider range. The low G gamma expression is also different from the Beninians since it contains a significant and unique cluster of individuals with lower than 38% G gamma. Interestingly, among the Bantu there is a strong correlation between HbF levels and G gamma expression, which is not seen with the other haplotypes. These findings open the possibility that among the Bantu haplotype-bearing individuals two chromosomal types exist that define different levels of G gamma and HbF expression. Further structural exploration of these two potential subhaplotypes is needed.\r"

The extent of in vivo proteolytic cleavage of the amino-terminal end of fibrinogen by thrombin and plasmin was determined and quantitated by specific radioimmunoassays. The samples were treated with cyanogen bromide (CNBr), and the total amount of fibrinogen and fibrin-derived protein was determined as NDSK, the NH2-terminal disulfide knot of fibrinogen. Thrombin-releasable fibrinopeptides A and B were used to quantitate fibrinogen and fibrin I. Previous plasmin cleavage of the B beta chain was inferred from the amount of B beta 1-42 and B beta 15-42 in undigested NDSK. The results obtained in both acute and organized thrombi indicate that approximately 60% of the total protein (as determined by amino acid analysis) was fibrinogen-derived and that 70% to 80% of the fibrinogen-derived material was fibrin II. These findings support the hypothesis that fibrin II as distinct from fibrin I is the predominant component in a thrombus. In samples from normal and atherosclerotic aortas, fibrinogen-derived protein comprised less than 10% of the total protein. Samples from grossly normal aortas contained only fibrinogen and fibrin I. Fibrinogen concentration decreased and fibrin II concentration increased with increasing severity of the lesions, suggesting that increased fibrin II formation is associated with progression of atheromas.\r"

Cytochalasin B and D both mimicked the thrombocytopenic plasma-induced morphological change and affected more megakaryocytes than did the thrombocytopenic plasma. Cytochalasin and thrombocytopenic plasma together had a synergistic effect, causing many megakaryocytes to form processes and break into cytoplasmic fragments 3 to 6 microns in diameter. Immunofluorescence staining with antitubulin antiserum showed that cytoplasmic processes formed in the presence of thrombocytopenic plasma contain microtubules and that fragments released by the megakaryocytes contain microtubule rings. A model for the cytoskeletal basis of platelet formation is proposed.\r"

The erythropoietin produced by these cells is both biologically active and immunologically cross-reactive with purified native human hormone in our radioimmunoassay. Erythropoietin release by these renal carcinoma cells appears to be stimulated by cAMP as well as by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (MIX). The response to cAMP involves a rapid and enhanced release of hormone, which occurred within 30 minutes of exposure of the cells to the effector and continued for at least 4 hours. Intracellular erythropoietin was higher in the control cultures than in the cells treated with cAMP, suggesting that cAMP stimulates the release of a storage pool of hormone. The ability of cAMP and MIX to elicit the release of erythropoietin suggests that a cAMP-mediated mechanism is involved in the release of this hormone.\r"

Recently, a C----T change at position -196 of an overexpressed A gamma globin gene from an Italian HPFH was hypothesized, on the basis of indirect evidence, to represent the cause of the functional defect. We now show that the same mutation is present in a different overexpressed A gamma-globin gene from a Sardinian patient with a different syndrome (delta beta zero-thalassemia). The Sardinian A gamma globin gene differs from both the HPFH and the normal A gamma globin gene at nucleotide 1,560 in the noncoding portion of the third exon, where an A is deleted. In addition, the mutant -196 A gamma-globin gene is linked to a normal beta globin gene in HPFH, and to a beta-thalassemic gene (beta 39CAG----TAG) in delta beta zero-thalassemia. These data strengthen the suggestion that -196 mutation is causally linked to the abnormal phenotype and raise the question of whether the same or multiple mutational events are responsible for the appearance of the -196 mutation in different syndromes.\r"

Recent evidence suggests that several of these SGPs associate with membrane skeletal proteins. Because the membrane skeletal protein network plays an important role in regulating the membrane material properties of deformability and mechanical stability, we wanted to determine whether the SGPs, through their interaction with the membrane skeleton, can modulate these membrane properties. We measured membrane mechanical stability and membrane deformability of erythrocytes that were deficient in either alpha, or delta or beta and gamma SGPs. Only erythrocytes deficient in beta and gamma SGP had altered membrane properties, as evidenced by marked decreases in both membrane mechanical stability (50% of normal) and membrane deformability (40% of normal). Erythrocytes deficient in either alpha or delta SGP had normal deformability and stability. Based on these data, we suggest that an interaction of beta and/or gamma SGP with the membrane skeleton plays a functionally important role in regulating normal erythrocyte membrane properties.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed methodology that allows comparison of the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) of fetal hemoglobin (HbF)-containing red cells (F cells) with the MCH of non-F cells from the same individual. To do this, suspensions of peripheral blood erythrocytes and their internal contents are fixed with an imidodiester, dimethyl-3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate dihydrochloride (DTBP). Thereafter fixed cells are made permeable to antisera by treatment with Triton X-100 and isopropanol, reacted with a mouse monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against HbF, and then with fluorescein-conjugated antimouse IgG. No appreciable hemoglobin is lost during such manipulation. Red cells from a diversity of subjects were thus treated and examined microscopically, first by transmitted light and then by epifluorescence. A direct correlation between Coulter-derived MCH and mean absorbance of 415 nm transmitted light was found for 100 unfixed (r = 0.96) and for 100 antibody-treated fixed-permeabilized red cells (r = 0.99) among individuals selected so as to provide a range of Coulter MCH values between 20 and 35. Comparisons of microscopically derived MCH of F cells and non-F cells were statistically nondistinguishable (P greater than 0.05) in all subjects. Such comparisons included normal individuals (less than 1% F cells), SS patients (7% to 48% F cells), subjects with congenital anemia (22% to 65% F cells), individuals with heterocellular hereditary persistence of HbF (HPFH) (12% to 21% F cells), and heterozygotes for beta + thalassemia (11% to 31% F cells). We conclude that gamma- and beta-globin production within F cells is regulated in a reciprocal fashion both among normal individuals and among individuals with elevated HbF production.\r"

Cultured fibroblasts and lymphoblasts showed a reduced methionine synthase activity and a growth requirement for methionine. Cobalamin incorporation by the patient's lymphoblasts was normal, but the proportion of cellular methylcobalamin in the patient's lymphoblasts and fibroblasts were markedly reduced and that of adenosylcobalamin normal. The reduced methionine synthase activity was independent of assay reducing (thiol) conditions, but normal levels of activity accompanied culture of the patient's lymphoblasts in medium with markedly increased cobalamin concentration. The characteristics of the reduced methionine synthase of our patient differ significantly from that of the previously described infant with cobalamin E disease and suggest that genetic heterogeneity may characterize this mutation.\r"

Five other mutations commonly found in the Mediterranean area occurred with frequencies of 2% to 8%.

A new mutation at codon 29 was found in two other patients with haplotype II.

In polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), the changes in CTC fluorescence upon stimulation are considered to monitor an early event in the activation process. Using quantitative video-enhanced microscopy, we report that in resting cells about 80% of the CTC signal emanates from the perinuclear region of the cell, indicating that internal structures are labeled with CTC. Approximately 20% of the total CTC fluorescence is taken up in a compartment sensitive to mitochondrial inhibitors, which is not present in neutrophils depleted of nucleus and granules or cytoplasts. Upon stimulation PMN loaded with CTC exhibit a rapid, biphasic decrease in fluorescence that is dose dependent. The second phase of the response is not seen in neutrophil cytoplasts. These results suggest that internal stores of CTC are responsive upon stimulation and could account for the later decrease in CTC fluorescence, whereas the early phase of CTC changes represents the plasma membrane response.\r"

We hypothesized that inhibition of neutrophil adherence and subsequent lung sequestration would attenuate the lung injury caused by activated neutrophils. Using isolated perfused rat lungs, we determined if anti-Mo1 monoclonal antibody (binds to the alpha subunit of a neutrophil glycoprotein [gp 155.94] that facilitates adherence) would attenuate lung neutrophil sequestration and lung injury caused by human neutrophils stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). PMA-stimulated neutrophils but not PMA or neutrophils alone caused lung injury as assessed by accumulation of 125I-bovine serum albumin into lung parenchyma and alveolar lavage fluid. Incubation of neutrophils with anti-Mo1 antibody prior to stimulation with PMA attenuated lung injury and neutrophil sequestration. Furthermore, a histological survey revealed that anti-Mo1 antibody inhibited neutrophils present in the lung from spreading following exposure to PMA. Anti-Mo1 antibody did not inhibit PMA-stimulated neutrophil release of granule constituents or toxic O2 metabolites as evidenced by lysozyme and lactoferrin release or the reduction of ferricytochrome c in the lung perfusate. The inhibition of lung injury caused by the anti-Mo1 antibody was not likely due to a nonspecific effect of the antibody, since another murine monoclonal antibody of the same class (anti-Mo5) did not inhibit lung neutrophil sequestration or lung injury. Thus, in this experimental model, interference with the close approximation of the neutrophil to its target site inhibited the ability of the activated human neutrophil to cause injury.\r"

To determine the active components of this process, we have studied the ability of monocytes to adhere to isolated components of the subendothelial matrix.

The monocytes adhere less well to fibronectin and bind poorly or not at all to collagen types I and IV, or to heparan sulfate. Monocyte binding to elastin requires an intact, crosslinked molecule as no binding was observed to soluble, acid-alcohol elastin extracts, to pepsin or elastase digests of elastin, to tropoelastin monomer, or to desmosine/isodesmosine crosslinks. Similar binding profiles to elastin, laminin, and fibronectin were seen with the established human leukocyte cell line U937. The promyelocytic cell line HL60 adhered equally well to laminin but showed slightly reduced adhesion to elastin when compared with the fresh monocytes or U937 cells.

In order to elucidate the mechanism(s) for the decrease in total NAD, we examined NAD synthesis in intact erythrocytes. It is demonstrated that NAD synthesis is impaired in PK-deficient erythrocytes to a degree that is dependent on the PK activity and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) concentration of these cells. After incubation in the presence of fluoride, which simulates the characteristics of PK deficiency by inhibiting enolase, normal erythrocytes had impaired NAD synthesis and decreased ATP concentrations. Fluoride did not inhibit NAD synthesis in a hemolysate system that is not dependent on glycolysis for ATP generation. These data suggest that fluoride does not inhibit the enzymes of NAD synthesis and that impairment of NAD synthesis by fluoride is mediated by decreased ATP formation. Thus, it is concluded that impaired NAD synthesis in PK-deficient erythrocytes is caused by decreased ATP formation due to the PK deficiency. Since the rate of glycolysis is limited by the availability of NAD+, it is suggested that impaired NAD synthesis causes further ATP depletion and thereby may enhance hemolysis in PK-deficient erythrocytes.\r"

  ".W": "A study of 100 patients with rheumatoid arthritis has shown good correlation amongst three rating scales when used for measuring severity of morning stiffness and severity of stiffness present at the time of interview. Duration of morning stiffness was found to correlate only moderately well with severity of morning stiffness and poorly with severity of stiffness present at the time of interview. Investigation of the patients' definitions of stiffness, with and without the aid of a list of descriptive words, indicated an inter-relationship of pain and limited movement in the majority. This linking of the two symptoms under the term 'stiffness' may explain why some objective methods of measurement do not appear to reflect the subjective stiffness of which patients complain.\r"

The most extreme abnormalities were seen in rheumatoid arthritis and the least in osteoarthritis. The seronegative spondarthritides and SLE occupied a midway position, emphasizing a correlation between biochemical abnormality and severity of inflammation. A low serum histidine characterized both RA and SLE. The former was more likely to be associated with a raised CRP. Plasma viscosity was characteristically raised in psoriatic arthritis and CRP in AS.\r"

  ".W": "Direct molecular and morphological techniques of modern microbiology were used to monitor the sequential development of bacterial microcolonies and biofilms in a rat model of urinary infection and to demonstrate that the urease activity of the infecting organisms sets in course a series of reactions in which struvite and apatite crystals develop within the matrix of the enlarging bacterial aggregate. This forms multiple stone nidi on the uroepithelial surface upon which succeeding bacterial biofilms develop and with the incorporation of other urine components, such as urinary mucroproteins, establishes a matrix skeleton that becomes mineralised, thus allowing for the growth of the stone in concentric layers. To arrive at this hypothesis, we studied infection stone genesis using a newly developed model for infection-induced bladder stone formation in the rat. We examined in detail the sequential events in the evolving microbial ecology of progressive struvite calculogenesis, using conventional microbiological techniques, direct ultrastructural observation, newly developed ultrastructural cytochemical localisation techniques and immunological procedures for stabilisation of the biofilm glycocalix and stone matrix in the rat model. It was concluded that the organic glycocalix material secreted by the associated bacteria comprises a substantial and aetiologically important part of the infection stone calculogenesis and matrix production.\r"

These results were not known to the urologist and did not therefore influence the course of surgery. There was a good positive correlation between both the severity and the duration of irritative symptoms and the presence of detrusor instability. Eighty per cent of patients were significantly improved 3 months post-operatively. Patients with detrusor instability or low compliance were four times more likely to have an unsatisfactory outcome than those with stable bladders. The outcome could have been predicted in half of the unsuccessful patients on the basis of their pre-operative symptom score and urodynamic studies. Whilst a full urodynamic evaluation is usually unnecessary, all patients should have a flow rate estimation and those with a high urgency symptom score and an unexpectedly high flow rate require full urodynamic assessment. These patients should be considered for alternative treatment or warned pre-operatively of the likely outcome.\r"

Urinary FDPs are markers of bladder tumour invasion.

Additional information was available for 1980 from Hospital Activity Analysis and the annual rate was 28/100,000. It is suggested that this is the best estimate of the incidence of renal stones in England and Wales. The rate ranged from 56/100,000 in Canterbury to 15/100,000 in Burton-on-Trent. The incidence of renal stones was higher in towns with better social and economic conditions. In comparison, climatic factors, latitude and water hardness were not important determinants of the distribution of renal stones.\r"

Socio-economic characteristics of the population were determined, such as occupation, history of previous infection, stone disease and backache. Simple urine and blood analyses were undertaken. There was no difference in stone prevalence between males and females (1.03:1) as distinct from treated stone patients. There were no differences between the sexes with respect to family history of stone disease but females have a greater chance of having had previous urinary tract infection.\r"

An equation was developed which correctly classified 90% of the patients who remained free of clinically significant pyelocaliectasis and 82% of the patients who subsequently developed clinically significant pyelocaliectasis. The statistically significant risk factors were renal calculi, bladder diverticula and a decrease in effective renal plasma flow. This study suggests that the presence of these risk factors warrants careful monitoring of renal function in these patients and appropriate management of bladder dysfunction.\r"

Specimens were examined for the presence of proteinuria, haematuria and whether the erythrocytes were normomorphic or dysmorphic as determined by phase contrast microscopy. Proteinuria occurred in 35% of those running the half and 69% running the full marathon. Haematuria with or without proteinuria occurred in 21% running the half and 22% running the full marathon. In runners with haematuria, dysmorphic erythrocytes were found in 30% of the half and 81% of the full marathon group. No urinary abnormalities were found on repeat examination 4 to 12 weeks after the run. These results suggest that non-glomerular bleeding, possibly from bladder contusions, predominates at shorter distances. With greater distances glomerular bleeding occurs. These abnormalities disappear with rest and do not appear to signify underlying urinary tract disease.\r"

  ".W": "From 1983 to 1986 140 patients underwent surgery for ureteric calculus. In approximately 30% \"blind\" basket extraction was considered appropriate and continued to be effective. Increasing expertise with the rigid ureterorenoscope led to a considerable reduction in open ureterolithotomy (15% in 1985-86), the majority following failed ureteroscopic extraction. In the same year both \"blind\" basket extraction and ureteroscopy were successful in 82 and 86% of attempts respectively. Electrohydraulic and ultrasonic lithotripsy were used in 12 patients to reduce large impacted calculi. The commonest complication of ureteroscopic stone surgery was perforation; this occurred in 14% of cases, though it was usually trivial and near the vesicoureteric junction. Perforations higher in the ureter tended to follow endoscopic lithotripsy and were often associated with urinary extravasation. Extra-ureteric stone fragments were also occasionally observed in such cases. There were no serious sequelae, although the in-patient stay was prolonged beyond the 48 h customary for uncomplicated extraction. The results suggest that ureteroscopic stone extraction, which can be conveniently introduced into urological practice, should become a standard endoscopic procedure.\r"

Carcinoma in situ in the prostatic urethra was found in nine patients (18%) and in all but one it was combined with CIS in the bladder. These results indicate that biopsies from the prostatic urethra must be taken routinely in order to plan adequate therapy.\r"

The maximum urethral pressure decreased during sleep but the urethral closure pressure remained positive when the intestinal bladder was not contracting. The peristaltic contractions in the intestinal bladder continued during sleep, causing incontinence. The nocturnal incontinence is probably a result of the reduced level of consciousness that makes it impossible to increase the tone of the external urethral sphincter during contractions of the intestinal bladder.\r"

In eight samples the only crystalline phase which could be clearly distinguished by X-ray diffraction was ammonium magnesium orthophosphate hexahydrate, NH4MgPO4 X 6H2O, which occurs naturally as the mineral struvite. However, atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed an appreciable concentration of calcium in all samples. Calcium phosphates have previously been detected in catheter deposits. Infra-red and EXAFS spectra were consistent with the calcium phosphate being present as a poorly crystalline hydroxyapatite. Thus the deposits appear to consist of a mixture of crystalline struvite and a form of hydroxyapatite which is not fully crystalline.\r"

Increasing the dose was of benefit only to organic patients who initially had a poor response.

The numbers diagnosed per year by 1985 were 20, compared with 9.4 per year for the period 1970-1979. This represented an increase in the percentage of Dukes' A cancers of all the colorectal cancers diagnosed from 8.3 to 15 per cent. The increase was largely due to better quality double contrast barium enemas and increased use of flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. The operative mortality dropped from 17 to 3 per cent in the last 6 year period. The recurrence rate was 9.6 per cent of which 1 per cent were locally resected and crude 5 year survival was 90.4 per cent up to 1981.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and experimental studies indicate that transfusion of allogeneic blood has immunomodulating properties, and that the behaviour of some tumours may be influenced by the immune system of the host. Eighty-seven patients who had undergone 'curative' resection of cancer of the colon or rectum were studied retrospectively to determine whether blood transfusion adversely affected the rate of cancer recurrence. Fifty-three patients (61 per cent) were transfused and 34 were not. The transfused and non-transfused groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, duration of follow-up, mode of presentation, stage of disease and haemoglobin level at discharge from hospital, and differed in admission haemoglobin and distribution of tumour locations (right- or left-sided colonic or rectal tumours). Recurrent malignancy was detected in 36 per cent of transfused patients and 26 per cent of non-transfused patients (P greater than 0.1). There was no association between the number of transfusions and recurrence for any tumour site or stage. The incidence of recurrence was significantly higher in those patients who received transfusions during surgery than in those who received transfusion either before or after surgery (chi 2 = 7.01, d.f. = 1, P less than 0.01) or no transfusions (chi 2 = 4.23, d.f. = 1, P less than 0.05). The study indicates that factors influencing the need for blood transfusion during operation had a greater bearing on prognosis than receipt of a blood transfusion per se and that future prospective studies investigating the association between transfusion and cancer recurrence need to determine accurately the indications for transfusion.\r"

The pylorus-preserving procedure of Longmire has reduced but not eliminated the long-term morbidity. Preservation of the whole duodenum with total pancreatectomy has been introduced for the treatment of patients with end-stage chronic pancreatitis after favourable experience with this procedure in infants for nesidioblastosis. Fourteen patients with chronic pancreatitis have had a total pancreatectomy with preservation of the duodenum and the bile duct. All patients are still alive (median follow-up 9.5 months) and none suffered major complications in the perioperative period. One patient developed a biliary stricture at 3 months, requiring biliary reconstruction. Six of the patients have returned to full-time work; nine require no analgesia. All patients require pancreatic enzyme replacement, and all patients have gained weight postoperatively. Diabetic control is satisfactory with a twice daily insulin regime. Duodenum-preserving total pancreatectomy is feasible in the adult without mortality or high morbidity; early experience suggests that preserving the duodenum improves gastrointestinal function with easier control of the diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis were investigated in 20 patients with oesophageal varices, who underwent endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) with 5 per cent ethanolamine oleate (EO), by means of serial determination of plasma fibrinopeptide A (FPA) and fibrinopeptide B beta 15-42 (B beta 15-42). One hour after the completion of EIS, the value of FPA was significantly increased to 38.1 +/- 11.1 ng/ml (mean +/- s.e.m.) from a pre-EIS value of 7.1 +/- 1.4 ng/ml (P less than 0.01) and it gradually returned to normal range by 48 h after EIS. A very similar change was observed in the value of B beta 15-42 (P less than 0.01). These observations indicated that EIS provokes transient activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. In vitro studies, however, revealed that EO inhibits fibrin clot formation because of the Ca2+-chelating ability of its constituent ethanolamine, although oleate or benzyl alcohol exhibited procoagulant activity in FPA formation in vitro. Nevertheless, an external application of EO or oleate over decapsulized kidney of rat resulted in a significant accumulation of 125I-labelled fibrin(ogen). From these results it was suggested that intravascular injection of EO, which exerts an inhibitory effect on coagulation in vitro, activates the local coagulation system. The activation may be accelerated by an acute inflammatory process provoked by oleate, which is supported by such clinical manifestations as mild fever, retrosternal pain leukocytosis and an increase in plasma fibrinogen level which was observed in all during the period.\r"

Five patients are improved and are well after a median follow-up period of 56 months. Two patients have had the U-tube removed electively. Three patients with progressive disease required further percutaneous catheter dilatation of intrahepatic strictures via the U-tube tract.

  ".W": "In a retrospective study of 100 patients with operable breast cancer, microscopic involvement of the nipple-areola complex was found in 16 cases. Each of these 16 cases occurred in patients with centrally situated tumours. In contrast, nipple involvement did not occur with peripherally situated tumours lying greater than 2 cm outside the areolar margin (P less than 10(-6), Fisher's exact test). Nipple involvement was more likely in patients with greater than or equal to 4 positive axillary nodes (P less than 0.01, chi 2 test). From this study it appears that nipple preservation may be undertaken during mastectomy for small peripheral tumours, provided the nipple is clinically normal, and frozen section analysis of the sub-nipple area is shown to be free from tumour invasion. These criteria for nipple preservation were satisfied in 20 patients out of a prospective series of 60. In this group, nipple preservation on the skin flap improved the cosmetic result of breast reconstruction in 35 per cent, and facilitated skin closure in 20 per cent. After a mean follow-up period of 50.4 months, nipple preservation was not associated with any significant excess of local recurrences.\r"

We (Frank and Wachtel, 1984) have described a process for reaching such decisions and a protocol for administering comfort care. During a 5-year period we offered this option to 24 patients.

Studies of haematopoiesis in burned humans are difficult because of the complexity of these patients and because of the difficulty of collecting specimens. We therefore established a mouse model of these haematopoietic events; however, this model differed from the human situation as all three haematopoietic cell lines were being produced by the murine spleen. In this paper, we modified the model by removing the spleen and then repeating our previous studies. After splenectomy, granulocyte production, murine mortality and body weight did not change. Compared with the original model, the modified splenectomy model could not expand erythropoiesis. The result was greater anaemia. This model is, now, a closer simulation of the human situation and will prove useful in studies of haematopoiesis after thermal injury.\r"

We have studied the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to support sheep which have received lethal pulmonary smoke damage. The animals (n = 19) received inhalation injury induced by insufflation with smoke derived from burning cotton delivered with a bee smoker. The treatment group, those placed on ECMO at the time of injury (n=6), were systemically heparinized and placed on a venovenous perfusion circuit consisting of a roller pump, membrane oxygenator and heat exchanger. Blood flow rate in the circuit approximated 20-25 per cent of cardiac output. The animals remained on partial venovenous bypass until the termination of the experiment 96 h after injury. All animals in the treatment group survived. The control sheep (n = 7) received inhalation injury alone and had a 100 per cent mortality (P = 0.0015 ECMO vs. control). Ventilatory management of treatment and control groups followed an identical protocol. We have also studied a third group (n = 6) composed of animals receiving inhalation injury with systemic heparinization but not ECMO. This group had a 66 per cent mortality at 96 h. These studies suggest that partial venovenous ECMO may be a valuable form of adjunctive treatment in severe inhalation injury.\r"

There is a significant incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder among recently burned patients, and the prevalence actually increases with time. This increase may be due to the incidence of the 'delayed' form of the disorder. Personality factors which may predict post-burn psychosocial outcome are neuroticism, trait anxiety and hypochondriasis. Burn severity does not usefully predict psychosocial outcome. The presence of compensation issues is associated with post-burn psychosocial difficulties, particularly in intimate family relationships. However there is no association with depression or anxiety. Pre-burn psychiatric morbidity is associated with poor post-burn psychosocial adjustment.\r"

These patients received 4500 to 5000 rad external photon therapy and two or three outpatient Californium-252 (252Cf) implants, plus sidewall boost irradiation. Treatment results were compared retrospectively to those obtained in a historical control group of patients with Stage IIIB cervical cancer treated with external radiation and conventional photon brachytherapy from 1972 to 1976. Local or regional tumor recurrence developed in 53% of patients treated with neutron therapy and an additional 9% experienced distant metastases. Thirty-eight percent of patients remain free of disease 12 to 96 months (mean, 51 months) after therapy. The 2-year and 5-year survival rates of patients treated with neutron therapy were 53% and 36%, which were not significantly different than those obtained with photon brachytherapy (2-year survival, 61%; 5-year survival, 34%). Complications of neutron therapy were minimal and included proctitis (19%) and vaginal stenosis (9%). There were no cases of enteric fistulae. Outpatient neutron brachytherapy was cost effective and was well tolerated by patients.\r"

The serum panel for this study consisted of normal blood donors, benign surgery (BS), head and neck cancer (HN), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), lung cancer (LC), and colon cancer (CC) patients. Immune complexes (IC) were isolated from these sera by precipitation with 3.5% polyethylene glycol (PEG), washed and then redissolved in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.2. The amount of IgA IC present were then quantified using the double antibody IgA ELISA. This assay was found to be both sensitive (26.0 ng/ml) and reproducible (intra-assay coefficient of variation 4.0%). The mean IgA IC for each cancer group tested (HN = 11.38 +/- 12.54 micrograms/ml; NPC = 13.36 +/- 17.56 micrograms/ml; LC = 17.39 +/- 13.04 micrograms/ml; CC = 26.50 +/- 4.60 micrograms/ml) were significantly elevated (P = 0.001) over both the normals (5.12 +/- 4.09 micrograms/ml) and the benign surgery controls (5.92 +/- 5.04 micrograms/ml). In addition to providing a new tumor marker the presence of high levels of IgA IC in cancer patients could provide a source of tumor-specific antibody as well as antigen and provide reagents to study immune regulation in cancer patients.\r"

Thirty-five additional primary SCC H/N specimens, cultured in the presence of 3T3 fibroblasts, were studied to assess the effect of tumor differentiation, site of primary tumor, and site of specimen procurement on growth. The authors conclude that 3T3 cells remain essential for optimal growth and cloning efficiency. Also, 3T3 cells improved the number of successful cultures by 33% to 100% depending on the plating density, and cloning efficiency was improved by 50% in the presence of 3T3 cells. Growth did not correlate with tumor differentiation or site of origin of the tumor specimen. Culture of specimens from the primary site resulted in growth significantly more frequently than culture of specimens obtained from metastatic neck nodes.\r"

The study compared vessel invasion and lymph node metastasis. Intraepithelial spread was seen in 111 lesions (63%) and gland duct involvement in 33 lesions (19%). Gland duct involvement was observed in 30% of the lesions positive for intraepithelial spread. In the intramucosal carcinomas, gland duct involvement was observed in 24%. Even in a very small carcinoma 7 X 5 mm in size, ductal spread was detected. This carcinoma did not reach the submucosa through stromal invasion. Patients with intramucosal carcinoma showed low incidence (20%) of lymphatic and/or blood vessel invasion and no incidence of lymph node metastasis. Examination by electron microscope showed that the cancer cells of the intraepithelial spread entered the duct by raising the normal ductal epithelium in the ductal cavity although the basal lamina was retained. Normal gland duct cells and cancer cells were either attached with desmosomes directly or were separated by degenerated epithelial cells. A high incidence of ductal involvement of the esophageal glands was seen in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, indicating its possible importance as a route to the deep tissue in the early stage of this carcinoma.\r"

Five patients had no symptoms, while the other 16 had epigastric pain, epigastric discomfort, or other symptoms. Melena or hematemesis occurred in five patients. The first detection was made by barium study in 16 and by endoscopy in five. Detailed examinations using double-contrast radiography in both the prone right anterior oblique and supine left lateral projections were useful to detect the early carcinoma of the gastric cardia. All depressed-type carcinomas were incidentally detected during endoscopic examinations of benign peptic ulcers, therefore, whenever endoscopic examinations are being done for other entities, all the stomach including the cardia should be examined, carefully and continuously. Compared with early carcinomas of the other areas of the stomach, grossly elevated and histologically well-differentiated early carcinomas were more common in the gastric cardia. In the mucosa adjacent to the carcinoma, chronic gastritis was apparent in almost all cases, although intestinal metaplasia was found less frequently than in other areas of the stomach.\r"

Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute at Houston over a 23-year period were reviewed. Patient's ages ranged from 30 to 89 years (median, 67 years). In nine cases, pure adenocarcinoma of the prostate preceded recognition of the small cell component by 7 months to 8 years (median, 18 months); five of these were initially at Stage A. There was a small cell component at presentation in 11 cases (10, Stage D). Small cell carcinoma was merging with the adenocarcinoma in 11 cases and represented 30% to 90% of total tumor volume. Eleven of 20 patients died of their disease. Those presenting initially with a pure adenocarcinoma survived between 7 months and 9 years (median, 24 months). After the recognition of the small cell carcinoma component, regardless of a prior history of adenocarcinoma, death followed within 1.5 years (median, 5 months). This study suggests a biologic difference in behavior in prostatic carcinoma containing a small cell carcinoma component. The small cell component may manifest early or late in the disease.\r"

  ".W": "This report is based on responses to a mailed questionnaire from 927 patients with lung cancer (730 men, 197 women), or their next of kin, and information obtained from the Saskatchewan Cancer Foundation Tumour Registry. Women were diagnosed at an earlier mean age than males (means +/- SE, 63.5 +/- 0.85 years versus 67.6 +/- 0.37 years, P less than 0.001), a finding which was consistent for each major histologic type. Women were more frequently diagnosed before age 60 years (42.0%) than were men (25.6%) (P less than 0.001). Female patients were significantly more likely to be lifetime nonsmokers of cigarettes than male patients (23% versus 3.7%, P less than 0.001). Among current smokers, women started smoking at an older age (19.3 +/- 0.69 versus 16.5 +/- 0.21 years, P less than 0.001), smoked for fewer years (41.0 +/- 1.2 years versus 47.4 +/- 0.57 years, P less than 0.001) and smoked slightly fewer cigarettes per day than male patients (23.6 +/- 1.0 versus 26.7 +/- 0.63, P less than 0.05). Similar results were found for the duration of the smoking habit and number of cigarettes smoked among exsmokers. When current smokers and exsmokers were combined, the distribution of pack years by gender was significantly different. A higher percentage than expected of women as compared to men, are clustered in the lower pack-year categories (P less than 0.0003). No occupational exposure or familial factors which might act in synergism with cigarette smoking were identified. Thus, women developed primary lung cancer at an earlier age while smoking for fewer years than men.\r"

  ".W": "A growth rate analysis of lung metastases of benign giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone, histologically indistinguishable from the primary benign tumor, is presented. The doubling time (DT) was 186 days in the first 13 months of growth, and 465 days in the last 4 months. These DTs are much longer than DT of lung metastases of any other tumors, and have a good correlation with a long survival time. Backward extrapolation showed that the lung metastases began to develop years before the primary tumor was diagnosed and treated. If this can be confirmed in a larger number of patients, it could be concluded that there will be no indication for amputation as a treatment for benign GCT whether or not lung metastases are present. The growth rate analysis supports the concept that these metastases might represent a benign process, and as such are a unique histologic and clinical phenomenon.\r"

Serum electrophoresis showed a striking hypogammaglobulinemia in all, and polyclonal immunoglobulin levels were markedly reduced. The immunofluorescence of plasma cells in bone marrow was positive for monoclonal light chain polypeptides in four patients, and the ultrastructure showed mature plasmocytes with a wide rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and an intact Golgi apparatus. In three patients, therapy with melphalan plus prednisone was started. The remaining two were treated with an M-2 protocol. Death was an early event in two patients; the response was good in the remaining patients, without differences regarding secretory MM. Despite some reports stressing an unfavourable prognosis in MM without M-component, in our series it is roughly the same as in MM with secretion.\r"

  ".W": "The importance of portal circulation in the delivery of drugs and nutrients to colorectal hepatic metastases is controversial. Using 13N (nitrogen 13) amino acids and ammonia with dynamic gamma camera imaging, we demonstrate, for the first time in human beings, a quantitative advantage of hepatic artery compared with portal vein infusion. Eleven patients were studied by hepatic artery injection, five patients were studied by portal vein injection, and two patients had injections through both routes. Data collected from the liver for 10 minutes after rapid bolus injection of 13N L-glutamate, L-glutamine, or ammonia were compared with 99mTc (technetium) macroaggregated albumin (MAA) images produced after injection through the hepatic artery or portal vein at the same session. Tumor regions defined from 99mTc sulfur colloid scans were compared with nearby liver areas of similar thickness. For the 13N compounds, the area-normalized count rate at first pass maximum (Qmax) and the tissue extraction efficiency were computed. The tumor/liver Qmax ratios for MAA and 13N compounds were highly correlated. Both tumor and liver extracted more than 70% of the nitrogenous compounds. The tumor/liver Qmax ratios reflect the relative delivery of injected tracer per unit volume of tissue. After hepatic artery injection the Qmax ratio was 1.03 +/- 0.33 (mean +/- SD), significantly exceeding the Qmax ratio of 0.50 +/- 0.34 after portal vein injection (P less than 0.003). Therefore, more than twice as much of a nutrient substrate is delivered per volume of tumor relative to liver by the hepatic artery as by the portal vein; the high extraction efficiency demonstrates that the hepatic artery flow is nutritive; and the delivery of substance in solution (such as nutrients or drugs) to tumor and liver tissue correlates with the distribution of colloids such as macroaggregated albumin after hepatic arterial and portal venous injection.\r"

  ".U": "87159164\r", 
  ".W": "Pathologic materials were available for review from 1597 women with Stage II (positive regional node metastases) invasive breast cancer in whom estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) assays of the primary tumor were performed. These women were enrolled in a clinical trial comparing the effect of postmastectomy adjuvant L-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with and without tamoxifen (NSABP Protocol No. 9). Significant pathologic and clinical associations with receptor status were similar for both ER and PR except that the latter, unlike ER, was not related to patient age. Regression analyses revealed that the most significant pathologic features related to a concordant positive ERPR receptor status was low (well differentiated) nuclear and histologic grades, slight or absent tumor lymphoid infiltrate, slight or absent necrosis and moderate or marked elastica in decreasing order of importance. All of the factors enumerated are directly or indirectly related to tumor differentiation. Recognition of four or five conforming pathologic features allows for the prediction of either ER or PR status in 70% to 80% of instances respectively, and the presence of three features in 69%. This latter figure is similar to that of estimation of nuclear grade alone. Thirty percent of ERPR estimates were discordant i.e., either ER-PR+ or ER+PR-. Pathologic features associated with discordant assays were not similar to those found when the ERPR estimates were concordant. Life table analyses revealed patients with discordant receptors to exhibit disease-free survival intermediate to that of those with ER+PR+ and ER-PR- values. This information suggests that a discordant receptor status is more reflective of an aberration of ER metabolism than a methodologic error. Histograms correlating frequency of nuclear grades with levels of ER and PR were comparable and revealed patterns indicating the propriety of relating values less than 10 fm/mg as being receptor negative. The frequency of well-differentiated nuclei increased with ascending levels of ER and PR.\r"

A high molecular weight anticancer agent, a conjugate of copolymer (styrene maleic acid) to neocarzinostatin (SMANCS) was prepared in our laboratory and dissolved in a lymphographic oily contrast medium, Lipiodol (SMANCS/Lipiodol). SMANCS/Lipiodol was administered intraoperatively to eight patients with colorectal cancer and preoperatively to one patient with gastric cancer with lymph node metastases. In six of the patients with colorectal cancer, the drug was administered via an artery and in the other two patients the drug was injected into the wall of the colon near the primary cancer. In the patient with gastric cancer, the drug was administered via the left gastric artery. Delivery of the drug to the lymph nodes was examined roentgenologically and the anticancer effect was examined histologically. The results showed that SMANCS/Lipiodol could be delivered to the metastatic lymph node via the artery, but it could not be delivered to the metastatic lesion of the lymph node via the lymphatic route. In the patient with gastric cancer, SMANCS/Lipiodol preoperatively administered via an artery was found to remain selectively in a metastatic lymph node and an anticancer effect was histologically proved in all three of the metastatic lymph nodes.\r"

Typically, the chest pain was sudden in onset and described either as substernal pressure or pleuritic in character. Few associated symptoms were noted. Evaluations for the etiology of the pain were unrevealing except for electrocardiographic changes suggestive of pericarditis in two cases and radiographic evidence of a small pleural effusion in one. The syndrome was self-limited or relieved with analgesics. There were no long-term cardiac or pulmonary sequelae. Discontinuation of bleomycin was not necessary although improvement was seen when the infusions were stopped. Further courses of bleomycin did not lead to recurrent episodes in most patients and are not contraindicated. Chest pain during continuous bleomycin infusion should suggest the possibility of a drug effect.\r"

The tissue concentrations of the various opioid peptides varied considerably. beta-Endorphin, a POMC-derived peptide, was present in concentrations between 9 to 12 pmoles/g tissue; 8 pmoles/g tissue of alpha-neo-endorphin, a pro-dynorphin-derived product, were seen, whereas the pro-enkephalin-associated peptides were present in much lower concentrations (0.6-2.1 pmoles/g tissue). Immunohistochemical studies showed scattered opioid-positive cells in the tumor tissue and in two other thyroid medullary carcinomas. These data demonstrate that malignant neuroendocrine tumors may contain peptides derived from all three families of the endogenous opioids.\r"

The clinical response of 37 previously untreated patients with various grades and stages of prostate cancer was correlated with androgen receptor binding and detailed histologic data obtained before treatment. All patients underwent cold-punch transurethral resection of the prostate and received endocrine therapy. The association between time to progression and cytosolic androgen binding was not significant. However, the associations of time to progression to nuclear binding and to total androgen binding were significant (P = 0.029 and 0.038, respectively). The authors found no association between clinical stage and time to progression, but did find an association between time to progression and pathologic grade (P = 0.003); grade 4 lesions were the least responsive to hormone therapy. When grade 4 lesions were excluded (N = 3), binding levels were still predictive of progression independently of grade and stage. The authors conclude that nuclear receptor binding activity in localized and metastatic prostate cancer tissue is predictive of response to hormonal manipulation.\r"

Slides were studied for 14 histologic variables from a group of 35 patients aged less 45 years and from 36 patients aged 65 years or more. The relation of these histologic factors to the length of survival and age group was then investigated. The results document the marked histologic and cytologic heterogeneity of the glioblastoma and reaffirm the importance of necrosis as a prognostic factor. The results further suggest that patients whose glioblastomas contained microcysts, pseudopalisading, cells with astrocytic differentiation, and large areas of better differentiated glioma, did better than those patients whose lesions were homogeneously composed of small cells or whose lesion had a small median nuclear size. The study reaffirmed the strong (P less than 0.0001) negative relationship between advancing age and duration of postoperative survival. The presence of necrosis, a smaller standard deviation of nuclear size, the extent of vascular proliferation, the absence of well differentiated neoplastic fibrillary astrocytes, and neoplasms composed homogeneously of small cells were related to patient age and offered a possible explanation for at least part of the observed age effect. However, the strong relation between age and survival remained significant when adjusted for other variables, and the effect of age must rest largely on factors other than those detected in this morphologic study.\r"

  ".W": "During a 20-year period, from 1963 to 1983, 68 patients were treated for carcinoma of the lung presenting in the superior sulcus. Their ages ranged from 41 to 79 years (median, 56 years). Thirty-six patients had squamous cell carcinoma, 13 had adenocarcinoma, 14 had large cell carcinoma, two had small cell carcinoma, and three had clinical diagnosis only. All tumors were considered to be inoperable or unresectable and were treated with external irradiation alone. The 3-year disease-free survival was 25%. Brain metastasis developed in 23 patients (34%); the brain was the first site of metastasis in 16 patients (24%), five of whom eventually developed other sites of metastasis. The cumulative probability of brain metastasis was 53% at 3 years. Brain metastases were seen in ten patients (28%) with squamous cell carcinoma, five patients (38%) with adenocarcinoma, seven patients (50%) with large cell carcinoma, and one patient without a histocytologic diagnosis. The proportion of patients younger than 60 years (19/41, 46%) who developed brain metastasis was significantly greater than that for patients 60 years or older (4/27, 15%) (P less than or equal to 0.01). Nine of 11 patients with metastasis only to the brain died as a consequence of the intracranial disease 1 to 13 months (median, 6 months) after the diagnosis of brain metastases. The other two patients received therapeutic irradiation to the entire brain and survived longer than 5 days after the whole-brain irradiation: one died at 62 months of intercurrent disease, and the other is alive and well 129 months after diagnosis. The high probability of brain metastasis from superior sulcus tumors, regardless of histopathologic type and the frequency with which the brain is the only site of clinical failure, suggest that systematic prophylactic cranial irradiation could reduce the morbidity and perhaps even contribute favorably to the survival of these patients.\r"

The current report documents the familial occurrence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in three women of consecutive generations who died of their disease at progressively younger ages. The diagnoses are histologically confirmed in all three cases. Although two of the women carried a single known risk factor for pancreatic carcinoma (cigarette smoking), a familial predisposition to this disease is strongly implicated. The case suggests that the role of inheritance in pancreatic carcinoma may merit further exploration.\r"

Two hundred women with early-stage endometrial cancer diagnosed between 1979 and 1981, and 200 matched community controls were interviewed in person and asked about smoking habits and other risk factors. Statistical analysis revealed a significant decline in relative risk with increased smoking (P less than 0.05). This effect strongly modified the well-known increase in risk with body weight. Among smokers risk did not increase with body weight, whereas among nonsmokers risk increased rapidly with body weight, especially among nonsmokers in whom the peripheral conversion of androgens was the primary source of serum estrogen. Despite this apparent reduced risk for endometrial cancer, smoking remains a major health hazard for women as well as men.\r"

  ".U": "87159185\r", 
  ".W": "Seventy-five cases of primary small intestinal lymphoma (PSIL) were diagnosed in adults at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC) during the period from 1961 to 1980. Two additional cases of immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID) in the premalignant phase also were studied. Thirty-two patients had IPSID; 27 non-IPSID; and in 18 patients it was difficult to distinguish IPSID from non-IPSID. While the former was shown to be a distinct disease entity with characteristic clinical, pathologic, and immunologic features, the latter was found to have no particular features in this part of the world. In addition to alpha heavy chain protein (AHCP) which is the biological marker of IPSID, the most important finding that distinguished the two diseases was that IPSID was always associated with a dense, compact mucosal cellular infiltrate (MCI) that was continuous and uninterrupted all along the length of the small intestine. In non-IPSID, MCI was lacking and the pathology was confined to sites of gross abnormalities. Sites distant to the primary lesion were free of disease. It was reported previously that the MCI in IPSID is characteristically diffuse plasmacytic or lymphoplasmacytic (DLP). Our study indicates that in addition to this infiltrate, the disease may be associated with another type of infiltrate which is follicular lymphoid (FL). Sixteen patients had DLP; ten, FL; and three, mixed infiltrate. The relationship of AHC disease and IPSID is discussed. AHCP may be found in intestinal fluid, serum, within the abnormal cell, or at its surface. Immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase studies must be done on all intestinal and nodal tissue specimens in all patients with PSIL for the detection of AHCP, particularly in those where serum and intestinal fluid are negative for this protein. The hypothesis that the DLP infiltrate represents the secretory form of IPSID, while the FL the nonsecretory form, is introduced. IPSID is an ideal model for the study of the etiology and pathogenesis of lymphoma in man.\r"

  ".W": "The findings are reported from a New Zealand Cancer Registry-based case-control study involving 427 male patients with testicular cancer registered during the period 1979-1983 and aged 20 years or more at time of registration. Controls were also males chosen from the Cancer Registry with two controls per case, matched on age and year of registration. It was found that, as in other countries, persons in the upper social class groupings were at increased risk of testicular cancer. Persons in professional occupations were also at increased risk, but the odds ratio of 1.09 was much smaller than found in other studies. The previously reported excess risks for farmers, food and beverage workers, forestry workers, and pulp and paper workers were not supported by the New Zealand data. On the other hand, the previously reported excess risk for sales and service workers including members of the armed forces was supported, to some extent, by the New Zealand data with odds ratios of 1.38 (95% confidence limits 0.98-1.93) and 2.15 (95% confidence limits 0.80-5.79), respectively. Other groups with elevated risk include: physicians (odds ratio = 6.50, 95% confidence limits 1.29-32.6); production supervisors (odds ratio = 2.85,95% confidence limits 1.00-8.13); and motor vehicle mechanics (odds ratio = 2.02, 95% confidence limits 0.93-4.42). However, the New Zealand data generally does not suggest that occupational factors (or lifestyle factors associated with occupation) are of major direct importance in the etiology of testicular cancer. The incidence of testicular cancer has a bimodal age distribution in New Zealand and has risen markedly during the period 1948-1979. The New Zealand data differed from patterns observed in other countries in that the relative increase was approximately uniform across age groups rather than being stronger in the younger age groups.\r"

The blood/gas partition coefficients of the four volatile anaesthetics decreased significantly after induction of anaesthesia and after surgical incision (p less than 0.05).

A model of anaesthetic morbidity dependent upon factors of patient illness, surgical practice, anaesthetic technique and physician experience, and duration of anaesthesia was developed. Postoperative anaesthetic morbidity was defined as any anaesthetic-related complication which, in the opinion of the follow-up nurse, was associated with prolonged hospitalization or documented compromise of the patient. Using a multiple logistic regression, ASA physical status was a risk factor for postoperative complications (odds ratio = 1.95) but the number of preoperative conditions and age were not. The type of surgical procedure, classified by site or by degree of trauma, did not influence postanaesthetic complication rates. The duration of anaesthetic exposure was an important determinant of risk (odds ratio = 2.53), with complications increasing with the length of anaesthetic time. As to factors under control of the anaesthetist those patients experiencing operating room complications (odds ratio = 3.36) or those receiving pure spinal (odds ratio = 5.53) or narcotic techniques (odds ratio = 2.14) had higher risks of postoperative complications. Finally, it would appear that the greater the experience of the anaesthetist the less the risk of postoperative problems (odds ratio = 0.52).\r"

MnSSERs were recorded prior to induction and at t = 20 min and t = 45 min postinduction. Fentanyl was administered as a slow bolus (53.2 +/- 9.1 micrograms X kg-1), followed by a continuous infusion at 10-20 micrograms X kg-1 X hr-1 (total dose 63.6 +/- 10.1 micrograms X kg-1). All MnSSER waveform components remained recordable and easily identifiable during anaesthesia. The effect of fentanyl was more pronounced on cortical waveform components, leaving subcortical components largely unaffected. There was a significant increase in the latency of the cortical MnSSER at t = 20 min, e.g., for the initial negative cortical wave, N1, the latency was 21.18 +/- 1.55 ms preinduction versus 22.18 +/- 1.42 ms at t = 20 min. There was also a significant decrease in the amplitude of the cortical response at t = 20 min, i.e., 2.04 +/- 1.30 microV preinduction versus 1.31 +/- 0.74 microV at t = 20 min. However, the degree of change was quite variable (range = 0-65 per cent). No further changes occurred at t = 45 min. The authors conclude that MnSSERs can be consistently and reliably monitored during high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia. However, fentanyl produces modest but significant changes in the MnSSER which should be taken into account lest they be misinterpreted as neurologic injury in evolution.\r"

The animals were randomly assigned to two groups: Group I received three doses of 3 ml of normal saline, Group II received three doses of 3 micrograms X kg-1 of clonidine, through an epidural catheter, whose tip was located between L2-T11. Control haemodynamic measurements were taken one hour after completion of the surgical preparation (period P1); they were repeated every 45 minutes after each incremental dose (periods P2, P3, P4) and 105 minutes after a total cumulative dose of 9 micrograms X kg-1 of clonidine or 9 ml of saline were given (period P5). No significant changes over time were observed in Group I. In Group II clonidine produced statistically significant reductions of systemic blood pressure (BP), mean left ventricular pressure (LV), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO) and peak LV dP/dt only after a total clonidine dose of 9 micrograms X kg-1 and these changes were sustained. BP fell 15 per cent, CO 21 per cent, HR 25 per cent, LV 20 per cent and peak LV dP/dt 30 per cent when P5 measurements were compared to control values within Group II (p less than 0.05). These haemodynamic effects of clonidine are likely due to minimal systemic absorption and/or cephalad spread of the drug towards its site of action in the brain stem. The reductions of HR, CO, BP, and isovolemic indices of contractility are likely explained by a reduction of sympathetic outflow at the spinal cord and medulla oblongata levels as well as increased parasympathetic tone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 1985 there were only seven Nepali anaesthetists in Nepal for a population of 16 million. An alternative approach to training is presented in which a series of Canadian anaesthetists, over a three-year period, are supporting the establishment of a one-year Diploma in Anaesthesiology program in Nepal. They are working with Nepali anaesthetists and the Institute of Medicine in Kathmandu, Nepal. The local anaesthetists supervise most of the clinical training while the Canadians give academic leadership and guidance.\r"

  ".U": "87159819\r", 
  ".W": "The case reports of two children with obstructive lesions of the larynx are presented to illustrate the advantages of transtracheal ventilation for paediatric endoscopic laser surgery. The first patient was a four-month-old infant with inspiratory stridor due to a subglottic haemangioma obstructing 80 per cent of the lumen. The second patient was a five-year-old child with posterior synechiae of the larynx. The anaesthetic and ventilation techniques were the same for both cases. A transtracheal catheter was introduced percutaneously into the trachea under endoscopic control and connected to a high frequency jet ventilator. The advantages of this technique during laser surgery are: clear vision of the operative field, good gas exchange, elimination of airway trauma from intubation, reduction of the hazard of airway fires, and decreased risk of aspiration of blood and debris. In addition, this method of providing oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation may be extended into the postoperative period. In certain situations, this technique can be an attractive alternative to a tracheostomy with its potentially dangerous and incapacitating complications in infants and small children.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we identified the precipitate formed when pancuronium bromide (pH 3.9) and sodium thiopentone (pH 10.6) are combined in vitro. A precipitate formed when sufficient pancuronium was added to thiopentone to decrease the pH below 9.25. The precipitate was isolated, redissolved in alkaline solution and identified as thiopentone using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Pancuronium was soluble in water in the pH range of 2.0 to 12.0, whereas thiopentone was soluble in water only at a pH greater than 9.90. We conclude that thiopentone precipitates when combined with pancuronium because of a pH-dependent decrease in the solubility of thiopentone, rather than a chemical interaction.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if bumetanide, like furosemide, improves shunt through pulmonary vasoactivity, 20 dogs with unilobar oleic acid pulmonary oedema were studied. Fractional perfusion and intrapulmonary shunt of the oedematous lobe were measured at: baseline, 1 1/2 hours after oleic acid infusion, 15 minutes later after either 0.1 mg X kg-1 of bumetanide in ten dogs (Bumetanide Group) or without bumetanide in ten dogs (Control Group), and 2 1/2 hours after the oleic acid, the bumetanide being administered immediately after the 1 1/2 hours post-oleic acid measurements. Lobar shunts for the Bumetanide Group were: 9.3 +/- 4.0, 54.3 +/- 13.6, 54.7 +/- 13.6, 38.6 +/- 12.0 per cent and for Controls: 8.7 +/- 1.6, 45.1 +/- 8.8, 48.3 +/- 7.8, 70.4 +/- 6.2 per cent. Fractional perfusions of the oedematous lobe were: 29.9 +/- 1, 14.7 +/- 1.1, 14.6 +/- 0.7, 19.3 +/- 1.9 per cent in the Bumetanide Group and 28.6 +/- 2.1, 14.2 +/- 1.1, 14.2 +/- 1.5, and 9.9 +/- 1.1 per cent in Controls. Oedema (wet to body weight ratio) was less (p less than 0.05) in the contralateral lobe (2.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.3) and the oedematous lobe (4.7 +/- 0.4 vs 6.0 +/- 0.5) after bumetanide-induced diuresis. We conclude that bumetanide decreases shunt by decreasing oedema and not through pulmonary vasoactivity.\r"

Between two and three hours preoperatively all patients received either oral ranitidine 150 mg, or placebo, with bromosulphthalein (BSP) 50 mg in 10 ml water, immediately followed by either 150 ml water or no further fluid. The residual gastric volume (RGV) in the two placebo groups was significantly lower in patients given 150 ml water (20.6 +/- 14.1 ml) than in those who continued fasting (29.9 +/- 18.2 ml) (p less than 0.05). The RGV was further significantly decreased in the two ranitidine groups (10.0 +/- 8.8, 9.7 +/- 10.5 ml) compared with the two placebo groups (20.6 +/- 14.1, 29.9 +/- 18.9 ml) (p less than 0.01). Mean pH values were significantly higher in the two ranitidine groups (6.71 +/- 0.99; 6.31 +/- 1.81) than in the two placebo groups (2.05 +/- 1.41; 1.72 +/- 0.33) but were not significantly different in the fluid versus non-fluid groups. In patients who ingested 150 ml water there was no correlation between the premedication interval and either RGV or pH values. The extremely low percentage of the original BSP (less than 0.9 per cent) in the gastric fluid of these patients demonstrated that gastric emptying of the ingested water was virtually complete prior to surgery. The combination of RGV of 25 ml or more with pH less than 2.5 was present in 56 per cent of patients who had only a sip of water with placebo, in 28 per cent of those who received 150 ml water with placebo, and in only two per cent of those patients who received ranitidine.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of cremophor EL were studied in 13 anaesthetized, paralyzed and ventilated dogs. Twenty per cent cremophor EL in a dose of 4.3 +/- 0.92 ml was infused at a rate of 30 ml X hr-1. In seven dogs, thoracopulmonary compliance, heart rate, systemic arterial pressure (SAP), pulmonary pressures (PAP, PCWP, RAP), cardiac output (CO) and platelet and white cell counts, were measured before the injection of cremophor EL, at the end of infusion and 5, 10, 30 and 150 minutes after the end of infusion. In six dogs, SAP, CO, and blood volume were measured before the injection of cremophor EL, at the end of infusion and 10, 30, 90 and 150 minutes after the end of infusion. Plasma histamine and catecholamines were assayed before the injection of cremophor EL and 2, 5, 10, 30, 90 and 150 minutes after starting the infusion. Cremophor EL induced a marked, sustained and significant decrease in SAP at the end of infusion and at 5, 10 and 30 minutes after the completion of the infusion (-68, -71, -70 and -43 per cent respectively), in PCWP, RAP and CO (-78 per cent at the end of infusion, -32 per cent 150 minutes after the end of infusion). Heart rate and systemic vascular resistance did not vary significantly. Pulmonary vascular resistance increased at the end of infusion, five and ten minutes after the end of infusion (+734, +548 and +439 per cent respectively). Plasma volume decreased 10 and 30 minutes after the end of infusion (-28 and -30.5 per cent respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Equianalgesic doses of butorphanol (40 micrograms X kg-1) and fentanyl (2.0 micrograms X kg-1) were compared as supplements to balanced general anaesthesia for outpatient laparoscopic procedures. Thirty-six adult female patients (ASA physical status I or II) participated in the study. The study drugs (butorphanol or fentanyl) were given just prior to induction of anaesthesia in a double-blind fashion. Following induction with a standard dose of thiopentone and tracheal intubation using succinylcholine, nitrous oxide in oxygen and a succinylcholine infusion were used for maintenance of anaesthesia. Seventeen of the 18 patients in the butorphanol group and 14 of the 18 patients in the fentanyl group showed signs of light anaesthesia and required supplementation with isoflurane. Induction, maintenance and recovery characteristics were not different in the two groups except that the post-intubation arterial pressure and heart rate in the fentanyl group were significantly higher than the base line values and the patients receiving butorphanol were more drowsy and also more pain-free in the postoperative period. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was high in both groups. Overall, butorphanol (40 micrograms X kg-1) used as part of a standard balanced general anaesthetic for a standard outpatient procedure was not superior to fentanyl (2 micrograms X kg-1) used in the same fashion.\r"
