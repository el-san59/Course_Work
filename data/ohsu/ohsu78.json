  ".W": "Testosterone metabolism was investigated in fractions of human skin, enriched in epidermis, dermis, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands, by histologic sectioning of skin punch biopsies, and the results were compared with two culturable skin cells, i.e., keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Since sebocytes could not be brought in culture, metabolism was also investigated in the hamster flank model. In the epidermal tissue of the skin biopsies the predominant metabolite was androstenedione, formed by the enzyme 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The same was true for cultured hair follicle keratinocytes. In the deeper skin layers the formation of androstenedione was markedly reduced, whereas the formation of 5 alpha-reduced metabolites was highly increased, with a maximum in the skin fractions containing large sebaceous glands. Cultured shoulder skin fibroblasts showed a markedly different testosterone metabolism compared with the sectioned skin biopsies, suggesting that dermal fibroblasts play a less important role in the overall skin testosterone metabolism. The present approach, allowing the comparison of testosterone metabolism in different substructures of the same skin biopsy provides new evidence that the high 5 alpha-reductase activity in the specific skin fractions must be mainly ascribed to the sebaceous glands. These results render a previous hypothesis, stating that the elevated level of 5 alpha-reductase and subsequent formation of dihydrotestosterone in androgenetic alopecia and acne (usually accompanied by seborrhea) could therefore simply be the consequence of sebaceous gland enlargement, much stronger. This hypothesis is further evaluated by quantitative correlation of sebaceous gland size with enzyme activity in the hamster flank model.\r"

  ".U": "87252355\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on cell division and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis by fibroblasts isolated from skin and scar was measured. We found that PDGF stimulates cell division more efficiently in normal skin fibroblasts than in scar fibroblasts and decreases GAG synthesis in skin and scar fibroblasts. Using a 4-h pulse label with [3H]thymidine ([3H]Thd) following a 20-h incubation of confluent monolayer cultures with 0-5 units PDGF/ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, we found a concentration-dependent increase in [3H]Thd incorporation. After incubation of fibroblasts with [3H]glucosamine and 35SO4 in the presence or absence of PDGF, labeled constituents were isolated from the extracellular, pericellular, and cellular fractions by pronase digestion and column chromatography on Sepharose CL4B or DEAE-cellulose and analyzed by cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The presence of PDGF decreased the total amount of 35S incorporated into macromolecules by skin and scar fibroblasts and resulted in an altered distribution of labeled GAGs. Dermal fibroblasts exposed to PDGF for 24 h incorporated a greater percentage of radiolabeled 35S into dermatan sulfate prime (DS') and less into dermatan sulfate (DS) in the extracellular fractions and a greater percentage of 35S into heparan sulfate (HS) in the pericellular fractions than did parallel cultures grown in the absence of PDGF. It is thought than PDGF may have an effect on scar formation by increasing the fibroblast population in the wound tissue and by affecting the total amount and types of matrix components synthesized.\r"

  ".U": "87252356\r", 
  ".W": "Using mouse tail epidermis as a model system we have studied the morphologic and biochemical effects of continuous topical treatment with vitamin A acid. Normal tail epidermis shows a regular pattern of parakeratotic scale regions and orthokeratotic interscale regions which arise postnatally from a uniformly orthokeratinizing neonatal epidermis. Daily treatment of tail epidermis with vitamin A acid for 14 days results in the induction of hyperplasia and the orthokeratotic conversion of the scale regions. The degree of these alterations is dose-dependent and maximally brought about by repetitive 30-microgram doses of the vitamin. To correlate morphologic with biochemical alterations, we have analyzed the keratin patterns of normal and vitamin A acid-treated epidermis by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The results indicate that repetitive vitamin A treatment leads to the selective suppression of two postnatally acquired 70 kD and 65 kD type II keratin proteins. Again the minimum repetitive dose required for their complete suppression is 30 micrograms vitamin A acid. Kinetic studies reveal an initial lag phase of 6 days of apparent nonresponsiveness, followed by a 5-day period during which the adult pattern is gradually replaced by the neonatal pattern. Repetitive treatment of tail epidermis with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate leads to a strong hyperplasia; however, it strictly maintains the scale parakeratosis. Under these conditions only the 70 kD keratin subunit is suppressed. This indicates that the suppression of the 70 kD keratin is generally linked to the induction of hyperproliferation, whereas the suppression of the scale-associated 65 kD subunit is due to the metaplastic potency of vitamin A. We provide evidence that this vitamin A-specific in vivo effect can be used to determine the biologic activity of synthetic retinoids relative to vitamin A acid.\r"

There was good agreement between in vivo and in vitro data using 50% aqueous ethanol, 6% Volpo 20, or total calf serum receptor fluids. Rat epidermal membranes in vitro were more than 20 times more permeable to cypermethrin than human epidermal membranes, indicating that cypermethrin would be less readily absorbed in humans than in the rat. The percutaneous absorption in vitro technique using epidermal membranes was successfully used with this lipophilic chemical to predict the in vivo absorption in the rat.\r"

Comparison of theoretical with experimental values for the permeability coefficients showed a good correlation for vehicles with solubility parameters between 12-18 (cal/cm3)1/2. For vehicles or mixtures of vehicles with solubility parameters in the range of 8-12 (cal/cm3)1/2, increases in flux and permeability coefficients were seen compared with theoretical predictions, possibly due to the similarity in solubility parameters of the vehicles to that of skin (10 cal/cm3)1/2. There was an inverse relationship between 5-FU solubility in the vehicles and flux or permeability coefficient that corresponded approximately to the point where the solubility parameters of drug and vehicle were the same.\r"

Eleven normal volunteers were investigated before (drug-free) and after 6-day periods of treatment with oral 5-MOP, first administered daily at 9 A.M. and after a 1-week free interval administered daily at 9 P.M. Under nyctohemeral conditions, the plasma melatonin levels were evaluated over a 24-h period in each session by hourly blood samples and radioimmunoassay. The sensitivity of the retina to light was also evaluated by means of electroretinography performed at 11 A.M. before and after a morning administration of 5-MOP. Plasma levels of melatonin were significantly increased from the second hour after 5-MOP administration. The hourly mean levels were significantly higher after 5-MOP administration compared to baseline values. This increased secretion was more pronounced after evening than after morning administration. Also, 5-MOP increases the sensitivity of the retina to light under photopic conditions and in the early stages of the dark adaptation period, as observed under scotopic conditions.\r"

The C5a was injected at the end of the weekly MTX cycle just before the intake of the first MTX dose and 3 h after the second of the 3 doses. The C5a-induced skin response was evaluated by measuring the diameter of the wheal and the area of the flare and by erythema index (EI), which was determined objectively by reflectance spectrophotometry. In all patients the skin response was significantly depressed when C5a was injected after MTX intake. The decrease of wheal, flare, and EI averaged 61.6%, 71.1%, and 57.5%, respectively, when all parameters were obtained at maximal skin response. The in vitro chemotaxis of peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes from the patients toward C5a was markedly inhibited after intake of MTX (p less than 0.01). The skin biopsies obtained after C5a injection before intake of MTX revealed a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate and considerable dermal edema. After MTX intake the number of infiltrating leukocytes and the degree of dermal edema was markedly reduced. This study indicates that MTX is a potent inhibitor of C5a-induced skin inflammation, and that this inhibition may be caused by a direct effect on circulating neutrophils and monocytes. The results obtained in this work support the idea that anti-inflammatory effects of MTX may be partially responsible for its antipsoriatic effect.\r"

Since the metabolic theory implies that the changes in flow rate during reactive hyperemia must be explained in terms of changes in concentration of a vasodilator metabolite produced during anoxia, the rate of rise to peak reactive hyperemic flow should discriminate between these two possible mechanisms. Accordingly, changes in human cutaneous blood flow were monitored during postocclusive reactive hyperemia. The absolute values of both the rate of rise from zero blood flow to peak reactive hyperemic flow and the rate of recovery from peak reactive hyperemic flow to resting levels decrease with increasing durations of arterial occlusion. The time-dependent decrease in both rates is compatible with viscoelastic characteristics of the wall of resistance vessels and is not consistent with changes in concentration of a hypothesized vasodilator metabolite produced during occlusion.\r"

In contrast, with 193 nm irradiation UDS was not detected in cells adjacent to the ablated area, even though DNA strongly absorbs this wavelength. Our results suggest that the lack of UDS after 193 nm irradiation is due to: \"shielding\" of DNA by the cellular interstitium, membrane, and cytoplasm, DNA damage that is not repaired by excision repair, or thermal effects that either temporarily or permanently inhibit the excision repair processes.\r"

  ".W": "Epitestosterone (EpiT) is the 17 alpha-hydroxy epimer of testosterone (T) and a natural steroid metabolite. It has previously been shown to be a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. We have studied EpiT as an antiandrogen using the hamster flank organ model. One-centimeter silastic capsules of crystalline T or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were implanted subcutaneously in female Golden Syrian hamsters to provide continuous androgenic stimulation. After 3 weeks, the pigmented spot was measured and the flank organs were fixed for histologic sectioning. The maximum surface area (SA) from a central section of the sebaceous gland and the diameter of hair follicles were measured using a computerized digitizing tablet. Following T and DHT, respectively, there was a significant increase in pigmented spot size (656/382%), sebaceous gland SA (210/315%), and mean hair follicle diameter (80/56%). A 1-cm capsule of EpiT alone had no androgenic effect. Five- and ten-fold doses of EpiT were implanted with T or DHT. Epitestosterone significantly inhibited the T-dependent stimulation of pigment, sebaceous gland, and hair follicle at either 5- and/or 10-fold excess doses. Additionally, a 10-fold dose of EpiT also inhibited DHT-dependent stimulation of all 3 cutaneous structures. We conclude that EpiT was effective as an antiandrogen and had no intrinsic androgenic activity in the hamster flank organ. It probably functions both as a competitive inhibitor of the androgen receptor and as a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. Pigment and sebaceous gland growth were more sensitive than the hair follicle to androgen inhibition by EpiT at the time and doses tested.\r"

In competitive binding experiments, 2 X 10(5) human PBMs or purified cell populations were incubated in the presence of small amounts of (5-50 ng) of 125I-labeled TSST-1 and increasing amounts of unlabeled TSST-1 (25-10,000 ng).

T4+ cells had 27.5 X 10(6) receptors per cell, and T8+ cells had 9 X 10(6) receptors per cell. T4+ and T8+ receptors had dissociation constants of 2.58 X 10(-8) M and 1.8 X 10(-8) M, respectively.

In the absence of C. parvum, survival (percent and duration) was lowest after total splenectomy and was proportional to remnant spleen weight after partial splenectomy. Although C. parvum treatment sharply increased splenic weight, nucleated cell numbers, and survival, the lowered mortality and improved survival time were independent of spleen weight. The rapidly acting, extrasplenic, splenomimetic protective effect of C. parvum suggests that this class of immunomodulators may be a useful adjunct in managing sepsis associated with defective or absent splenic function.\r"

Two-thirds of the patients had urinary tract symptoms, and these symptoms were more common in men than in women. The existence of previous lesions in the bladder favored the development of serious urinary symptoms (encrusted cystitis). Alkaline urine had abnormal sediment that yielded Corynebacterium group D2 in the absence of other microorganisms, a result suggesting that this organism could be an etiologic agent of UTI. Because cultures of urine may appear to be sterile, prolonged incubation must be used to detect Corynebacterium group D2. Correct treatment improved the outcome and probably prevented the development of encrusted cystitis in most of our patients.\r"

We used two strains of viridans streptococci highly susceptible to killing by rifampin and two resistant strains. All rats were injected with 10-1,000 times the ID90 of the four strains. Single-dose rifampin successfully prevented endocarditis due to all four strains. A few prophylaxis failures were observed after challenge with the two poorly susceptible strains, but in vivo emergence of resistant variants did not account for these failures.

Ninety percent of mice developed IgG antibody to CB3 by ten days after challenge. CB3 titers from placental tissue peaked at two to four days after maternal infection, but moderate titers persisted for at least eight days. Though virus could be recovered (less than 1.0-1.5 log10 pfu/g) from fetal tissue in only a small percentage (3%-13%) of pregnancies, virus could be found in some fetuses eight days after maternal infection. Despite the low rate of fetal infection, many pups born to dams infected one to eight days before delivery were either stillborn (4%-41%) or died from infection shortly after birth (14%-68%). The actual percentages depended on the time interval from infection of the dams to delivery. Maternal IgG antibody to CB3, which appeared at six to eight days after infection, protected against postnatal mortality, but did not protect against stillbirth.\r"

  ".W": "The sera of 12 patients with presumed chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection lacked antibody to a component of the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) complex encoded by the BamHI K fragment of viral DNA. This anomaly, detected in approximately 18% of sera obtained from patients with a diagnosis of \"chronic mononucleosis,\" was more often found in patients with severe disease (approximately 32%) who had objective clinical findings and markedly elevated antibody titers to EBV replicative antigens than in those patients with the \"fatigue syndrome\" (10%). The lack of antibody to the K nuclear antigen is specific because most of those who did not have antibody to the K antigen made antibody to other latent nuclear (EBNA 2) antigens or nuclear early antigens. Such patients are thus able to lyse immortalized cells, release nuclear products, and present them to the immune system. Three hypotheses are suggested to explain the lack of antibody to the K antigen: a viral mutation, a failure of immune recognition, or lack of in vivo expression of the antigen due to extensive viral replication. Lack of antibody to one component of EBNA may serve as an objective serological marker for certain patients with chronic EBV infection.\r"

Rhinoviruses were the most frequently isolated respiratory pathogen in all age groups, including young children. The pattern of age-specific isolation rates was similar to that for total respiratory illness. Rhinovirus-associated illnesses were generally mild but of relatively long duration; restriction of daily activity was frequent, especially in certain age groups. Typing of all isolates has been completed; with high-quality antisera nearly all isolates could be typed. Thus, new serotypes are probably not evolving, and most have already been identified. Differences in frequency of occurrences of different serotypes were evident, but ranking in order of importance was difficult based on existing data.\r"

Seroconversion (titers of antibody greater than or equal to 1:11) was found in all subjects at 49 and 90 days after vaccination. Titers were higher for subjects receiving 100% of the recommended dose im than for those receiving 10% of this dose id (P less than .01); these titers in turn were higher than those from persons receiving smaller doses (P less than .05).

The capacity of Capnocytophaga to cause sepsis and local infections in both immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised hosts has been documented. Given the recognition that serum resistance may contribute to the virulence of some gram-negative bacteria, we attempted to define the serum sensitivity of clinical isolates of Capnocytophaga from blood and other sites of infection. Whereas nine of nine isolates from human subgingival plaque showed greater than 95% loss of viability under standardized assay conditions, nonoral isolates exhibited variable serum sensitivity. Six of six isolates from blood showed considerable serum resistance (mean survival, 59.7% +/- 38.3%; range, 14.4%-113.3%). Comparison of the electrophoretic mobilities of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from sensitive and resistant strains revealed reduced LPS heterogeneity and lower apparent molecular weight among serum-resistant strains. Thus, serum resistance, possibly influenced by LPS structure, may be an important factor contributing to the pathogenic potential of Capnocytophaga spp.\r"

This pattern of periodic CB5 epidemicity is quite distinct from the general endemicity typical of other group B coxsackieviruses. To determine the genetic relationships among CB5 isolates from different outbreaks, we compared viral RNAs by ribonuclease T1 oligonucleotide fingerprinting. Isolates obtained within an epidemic year had very similar fingerprints, an observation indicating that they were closely related variants of a single genotype. CB5 isolates from the major 1972 epidemic were not closely related to the genotype associated with the preceding epidemic of 1967. However, isolates from the most recent CB5 epidemic year, 1983, had fingerprints nearly identical to those of the 1967 strains. These findings provide clear evidence for epidemic reemergence of the 1967 genotype and suggest that the virus was maintained under conditions approaching evolutionary stasis during the intervening 16-year period.\r"

The ages of the patients ranged from one month to 69 years; 90% were less than 15 years of age. The clinical picture was similar to that of the ordinary and modified forms of smallpox. Lymphadenopathy, occurring in the early stage of the illness, was the most important sign differentiating human monkeypox from smallpox and chickenpox. The symptoms, signs, and the course of the disease in patients who had been vaccinated against smallpox differed significantly from those in unvaccinated subjects. Pleomorphism and \"cropping\" similar to that in chickenpox occurred in 31% of vaccinated and 18% of unvaccinated patients. The prognosis depended largely on the presence of severe complications. No deaths occurred among vaccinated patients. In unvaccinated patients the crude case-fatality rate was 11% but was higher among the youngest children (15%).\r"

HBV DNA (2 pg/ml-42,000 pg/ml) was detected in 11 carriers and correlated with endogenous DNA polymerase activity and e antigen (HBeAg) titer greater than or equal to 1:640. Viral DNA was detected in the saliva, at concentrations indicating a virus titer of 10(5)-10(7)/ml, of eight carriers and in semen from three patients (10(6)-10(7) virions/ml). HBV DNA in saliva and semen had electrophoretic mobilities similar to those in serum HBV DNA, but HBV DNA was present at much lower concentrations (10(-2)-10(-4) that of serum DNA). Results of isopycnic centrifugation suggested that DNA in saliva and semen was virion associated. These data provide an indication of the quantity of virus present in the semen and saliva of HBV carriers and the relative frequency with which shedding of high titers of virus (greater than 10(5) virions/ml) occurs in these secretions.\r"

One patient had unilateral progressive panophthalmitis, with ocular cultures positive for Histoplasma capsulatum. These relapses occurred despite conventional treatment with large doses of amphotericin B. Prolonged remissions were associated with using small doses of this drug. One patient had a long-term remission while taking ketoconazole daily for more than four years. These patients did not have conditions associated with immunosuppression. Lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens and, in one patient, to histoplasmin, was markedly reduced at the time of relapse and when tested preceding a relapse. All three patients showed a reversal to normal lymphocyte proliferation at the time of the longest last remission.\r"

Crude preparations containing both toxins totally inhibited chemotaxis and chemiluminescence responses of PMNLs and reduced PMNL viability. Purified alpha toxin did not alter PMNL viability, chemotactic responsiveness, or morphology but did enhance opsonized zymosan-induced PMNL chemiluminescence over a wide range of toxin concentrations. theta Toxin, at 12.5 hemolytic units (HU) per 10(5) PMNLs, reduced cell viability and induced marked PMNL morphological changes. Concentrations of theta toxin between 4 and 32 HU per 10(5) PMNLs inhibited PMNL chemiluminescence in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a lower concentration enhanced the PMNL chemiluminescent response to opsonized zymosan. Effects on chemotaxis were also dose dependent. Increased PMNL random migration was observed at a concentration of theta toxin of 0.06 HU per 2.5 X 10(5) PMNLs (P less than .05), whereas concentrations of greater than 0.08 HU per 2.5 X 10(5) PMNLs reduced both directed and random migration (P less than .05).\r"

We used the highly sensitive technique of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with selected ion monitoring (SIM) of m/e 312 and m/e 167 for detecting TBSA in 405 clinical sputum specimens collected in Hong Kong, where tuberculosis is still common. TBSA was detected in 39 M. tuberculosis smear-positive, culture-positive specimens; 63 of 66 smear-negative, culture-positive specimens; and 1 of 300 smear-negative, culture-negative specimens. Thus, for screening of sputa from individuals with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis, the detection of TBSA by GC-MS/SIM is highly specific and more sensitive than conventional microscopy and more rapid but slightly less sensitive than conventional culture methods.\r"

Fifty-eight (67%) of 87 patients became colonized, 28 by the time of admission to a Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit. Enterobacter cloacae was four times more prevalent than Enterobacter aerogenes. We found increased Enterobacter colonization, after prophylaxis, in 45% of surgery patients. None of 25 control patients, who underwent coronary angioplasty and received no antibiotic prophylaxis, showed increased colonization (P = .001). Both groups had similar baseline rates of Enterobacter carriage. Typing showed 50 distinct strains of E. cloacae and 11 of E. aerogenes; 25% of patients carried greater than or equal to 2 strains simultaneously. In the nine cases of horizontal transmission, source patients were intubated for greater than or equal to 5 days and had heavy throat carriage of Enterobacter. No environmental sources of transmission were found. Clinical Enterobacter infection developed in 12 patients; at least nine of these were infected with a strain that had been isolated by surveillance culture. We conclude that Enterobacter, part of the patients' endogenous flora, becomes an important pathogen when amplified by prophylactic antibiotics and is less often transmitted horizontally.\r"

No resistance occurred after therapy with either BMY 28142 (25 mg/kg, two doses) or Sch 34343 (50 mg/kg, two doses). Heterogeneous resistance to beta-lactams among the cells within a given Enterobacter population accounted for these differences. The minimal concentration inhibiting the growth of the preexisting resistant variants, together with the antibiotic concentrations obtained in the peritoneal fluid, were associated with further emergence of resistance in the mouse treated with this antibiotic.\r"

Decreasing the time interval between the administration of constant doses of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) resulted in decreases in the frequency of development to the blastocyst stage but had no significant effect on development to the two-cell stage. Preincubation of postovulatory oocytes in vitro prior to insemination did not compensate for the reduced preovulatory development in vivo but resulted in decreases in the frequency of development to the blastocyst stage. The results indicate that inadequate preovulatory development of superovulated mouse oocytes can adversely affect the preimplantation development of in vitro fertilized embryos in the absence of a visible inhibitory effect on development to the two-cell stage and also that preincubation of postovulatory oocytes in vitro prior to fertilization reduces subsequent developmental capacity.\r"

Seventy-eight (84%) completed the questionnaires.

An acute and a late phase of hypertension, 4 days and 28 days after the aortic ligature respectively, were defined to study the relationship between the severity of hypertension and injury of the small arteries and myocardial necrosis. The most frequent finding in the heart was the presence of right ventricular infarction. In acute-phase hypertension most of the animals showed acute infarction of the right ventricle, but only focal left ventricular infarction was found. Lesions in the large coronary arteries were not observed. However, the small arteries and arterioles of the right ventricle presented fibrinoid necrosis lesions. In late-phase hypertension, the intramyocardial small vessels showed proliferative endarteritis and fibrinoid necrosis lesions, but this time they appeared in both ventricles. The severity of the myocardial infarcts and the percentage of small arteries and arterioles injured in the right ventricle were significantly higher than in the left ventricle despite the maintenance of blood pressure almost to the same level. No changes in the right ventricular pressure were observed in either phase. These observations suggest that in malignant renovascular hypertension the intramyocardial arteriolar lesions appear to be an important factor in the production and the severity of myocardial infarcts with predominance in the right ventricle.\r"

Six healthy volunteers were given intravenous infusions of [ring-2,5,6-3H] levo-norepinephrine, followed by collection of urine for 24 hours. Specific activities were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography for each of the three O-methylated metabolites of norepinephrine in the urine samples, and were then used to calculate the fraction of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid (VMA) formed from 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and from normetanephrine. These values were used, in conjunction with total excretion of each of these metabolites, to calculate the fraction of MHPG and normetanephrine converted to VMA. The fraction of VMA formed from MHPG was 0.821 +/- 0.020, and that from normetanephrine was 0.179 +/- 0.020. Whereas fractional conversion of normetanephrine to VMA was 0.634 +/- 0.030, that of MHPG to VMA was only 0.507 +/- 0.025. Similar results were obtained when the experiment was repeated in three of the subjects using [8-14C] levo-norepinephrine, suggesting that isotope, specific activity, and position of the label were not determinants of the values obtained. The present results confirm the extent of conversion of MHPG to VMA described by others, and suggest that a higher percentage of normetanephrine than previously reported is converted to VMA.\r"

The current study of 41 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis examined whether T cell subpopulations also acquired antigen-specific suppressor function during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, contributed to monocyte-mediated suppression of tuberculin responses, or both. Alteration in the numbers of circulating T-helper (Leu 3a) and T-suppressor (Leu 2a) cells was not observed in patients with tuberculosis, nor did Leu 2a cells selectively modulate in vitro tuberculin responses. The numbers of circulating T gamma cells, a subset of T cells identified by surface receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (Fc gamma R), was increased twofold in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. Depletion of T gamma cells from in vitro cell culture consistently and selectively increased tuberculin responsiveness of T cells from patients with tuberculosis. In addition, in the absence of T gamma cells, monocyte-mediated suppression of tuberculin responses was demonstrated in each patient observed. These studies demonstrate that during M. tuberculosis infection T gamma cells acquire antigen-specific suppressor cell activity and suggest that T gamma cells also contribution to immunoregulation modulating the expression of tuberculin-specific suppression by monocytes.\r"

The enhancing activity of serum did not separate with any isolated protein as assessed by Sephadex G-50-80 chromatography or protein electrophoresis.

The bleomycin injury to rats represents a model of PMN-prominent alveolitis leading to fibrosis. We examined a method of identifying the alveolitis during its PMN-prominent phase with indium 111-labeled homologous PMNs (In-PMNs). When pairs of injured and uninjured rats were compared, greater activity was consistently found persisting in the lung images of the injured rats, both several hours (early) and a day (late) after injection of In-PMNs. Differences could likewise be identified when lung activity was normalized to activity of the injectate, the spleen, and variably the liver, as determined from organ images. These differences in gamma camera images were supported by direct measurement of activity in organs obtained by killing the animals after scanning. When groups of animals were compared, lung/spleen ratios appeared to most consistently differentiate the group of normal animals from those with alveolitis. These methods may provide a noninvasive means of identifying PMN prominence in the lung, which occurs in some fibrotic processes.\r"

Despite these findings, neither NK cytotoxic activity nor binding to K562 targets was affected by the addition of any of three anti-Fn antibody preparations, nor by the addition of exogenous Fn at concentrations found in plasma (300 micrograms/ml). Although Fn appears to bind both to K562 targets and to lymphocyte preparations that contain NK cells, it does not appear to have a functional role in mediating NK cell activity against K562 tumor cells.\r"

Liver damage was monitored by aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity and by histologic examination, and serum Gc was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transblotting with anti-Gc. In controls and treated animals displaying slight liver damage, greater than 90% of Gc was of mobility corresponding to native purified hamster Gc, whereas with more severe liver damage up to 100% of Gc was found in one of two cathodal configurations that appear to correspond to complexes with actin. Densitometric quantitation of complexed Gc demonstrated a strong correlation with the severity of liver damage. These results show PAGE to be a useful method of estimating the percentage of Gc complexed in serum, and suggest that cell damage may be followed by the appearance in the circulation of cellular actin that complexes with Gc.\r"

In addition, this compound has been described as having significant anti-inflammatory activity. These properties have generally been attributed to the effectiveness of this compound as a hydroxyl radical scavenger. However, DMSO can also act as a reductant under certain conditions, yielding its fully oxidized form, dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2), as the product. Therefore, we evaluated the ability of these two compounds to interfere with the production of oxidants other than the hydroxyl radical by stimulated human neutrophils. In a cell-free assay, DMSO was found to quench the oxidant activity of hypochlorous acid. Neither DMSO nor DMSO2 reacted with superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, taurine chloramine, or monochloramine in this system. However, both DMSO and DMSO2 significantly suppressed the production of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorous acid by human neutrophils stimulated with either phorbol myristate acetate or opsonized zymosan. Neutrophil viability was not reduced by either DMSO or DMSO2. Inhibition of the oxidative function of stimulated neutrophils by DMSO may provide an alternative explanation for the effects of this compound on the microbicidal activity of neutrophils and as an in vivo anti-inflammatory agent.\r"

  ".W": "Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) can be stimulated to release granule contents and to produce superoxide anion. These functional responses are associated with cellular alkalinization and influx of Na+ in exchange for H+. Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic that will inhibit stimulus-induced Na+-H+ exchange and prevent an increase in cell pH. Amiloride has been shown to inhibit a number of protein kinases including the calcium phospholipid-dependent protein kinase. Because PMA, which binds and activates C-kinase, is a potent stimulus of the PMN, this study was undertaken to investigate the effect of prolonged incubation of PMNs with amiloride on PMN stimulation by the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (FMLP), the calcium ionophore A23187, opsonized zymosan particles, and the tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Our results demonstrate that amiloride inhibits superoxide anion production by FMLP, A23187, and opsonized zymosan by causing a slower rate of release and lower maximal release without altering lag time. In contrast, amiloride, despite an inhibition of 22Na+ influx, did not affect superoxide anion production stimulated by PMA. PMN degranulation, phagocytosis, arachidonic acid release, and early influx of calcium were unaffected by preincubation with amiloride. These data suggest that PMN superoxide release induced by FMLP, A23187, and opsonized zymosan is likely modulated by amiloride-sensitive Na+-H+ exchange; and phorbol ester-induced superoxide anion release and degranulation by any stimulant do not appear to be modulated by inhibition of an amiloride-sensitive Na+-H+ exchange.\r"

To test the importance of the intact liver in maintaining homeostasis of pyrimidine nucleosides and oxypurines in plasma and CSF, we performed a greater than 90% or sham hepatectomy on New Zealand white rabbits. At 1, 6, 12, or 24 hours after real or sham hepatectomy, plasma and CSF nucleosides and oxypurines were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. At all times after hepatectomy, the concentrations of the pyrimidine deoxyribonucleosides (deoxycytidine, deoxyuridine, and thymidine) were increased approximately threefold in plasma and CSF compared with sham-operated controls. Twenty-four hours after hepatectomy, the concentrations of uridine and cytidine in plasma were decreased by 70% and 50%, respectively, and in CSF by 50% and 40%, respectively, when compared with the concentrations in the sham-operated controls. Hypoxanthine concentrations in CSF were increased approximately twofold at 6, 12, and 24 hours after hepatectomy. These results suggest that liver function is essential for the maintenance of normal concentrations of pyrimidine nucleosides in plasma and CSF. That pyrimidine nucleoside concentrations are disrupted in plasma and CSF in this model of acute liver failure suggests that pools of pyrimidine nucleotides in some tissues (e.g., brain) may be altered by liver failure.\r"

Blood flow to the lower extremity was measured and sampled for lactate, catecholamines, and oxygen content in 12 normal men at rest, at all stages of bicycle ergometry, and during the postexercise recovery period. Whole body oxygen consumption and cardiac output were recorded throughout the experiment. Limb blood flow increased in a near-linear manner with both whole body and limb oxygen consumption. Although cardiac output rose with increasing whole body oxygen consumption, the increment in cardiac output diminished between submaximal and maximal levels of exercise resulting in a curvilinear relationship between blood flow to the exercising limb and cardiac output; this indicates that a major redistribution of cardiac output to the exercising lower extremity occurs, particularly at maximal levels of exercise. Covariance analysis suggested that limb oxygen consumption was the primary determinant of limb blood flow and limb vascular resistance during exercise. Arterial and venous lactate and catecholamine concentrations, obtained from the exercising lower extremity, could not be implicated as factors having a major influence on blood flow to that limb. The rate of lactate efflux from the limb during and after exercise, however, was directly related to limb blood flow.\r"

We studied several sensitive biochemical parameters of hepatocellular function and toxicity in rats after intravenous ferrite injections to determine whether there was any evidence of iron-induced hepatotoxicity. Light microscopy and iron determinations were performed on the liver, spleen, lung, and kidney. Forty-eight hours after a massive (250 mg iron per kilogram) ferrite injection, liver, spleen, and lung nonheme iron concentrations were markedly increased. Microscopy showed this iron to be entirely in reticuloendothelial cells. Despite the large increase in hepatic iron concentration, we found no evidence of hepatic mitochondrial or microsomal lipid peroxidation or organelle dysfunction, sensitive biochemical indicators of iron-induced hepatocellular injury. At 10 to 11 weeks after administration of ferrite in smaller doses (30 mg iron per kilogram), results of all biochemical and morphologic studies were normal. Furthermore, quantitative iron determinations and microscopic studies suggest that ferrite particles may be partially degraded and that iron is cleared from the liver during a 3-month period. Because ferrite particles are taken up by reticuloendothelial cells, hepatocellular function is not impaired and iron-induced hepatocellular injury does not occur.\r"

To clarify the mechanism by which bile salts can injure the esophageal mucosa, we studied the effects of exposure to the bile salts taurocholate and deoxycholate in an in vivo perfused rabbit model of esophagitis. Specifically we examined the roles of accumulation of bile salt by the mucosa and solubilization of mucosal lipid into the lumen during bile salt-induced mucosal injury. Results showed a consistent association between bile salt accumulation by the esophageal mucosa and bile salt-induced disruption of the physiologic barrier to diffusion. Under certain conditions, bile salts caused barrier disruption with no release of lipid from the mucosa. Whenever exposure to bile salt did cause release of mucosal lipid into the lumen, a significant amount of morphologic injury was also observed by light microscopy. The findings suggest that the presence of bile salt in the mucosa is an important aspect of the mechanism of bile salt-induced barrier disruption. Solubilization of mucosal lipids into the lumen occurs when bile salts cause an injury that is severe enough to result in light microscopic evidence of morphologic damage.\r"

To further study these relationships, 11 groups of three volunteers were fed a synthetic vitamin K-free diet for 2 weeks. During the last 10 days of vitamin K restriction, seven of the volunteer groups received a therapeutic dose of antibiotics not containing NMTT: ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (Bactrim), cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, clindamycin, and piperacillin, and three groups received NMTT-containing antibiotics: moxalactam, cefamandole, and cefoperazone. Serum phylloquinone (vitamin K1) concentrations reflected dietary intake and fell from 1.4 +/- 0.9 ng/ml after 3 days of hospital diet to 0.4 +/- 0.3 ng/ml after 13 days of vitamin K-free diet. Median stool excretion of phylloquinone was 19 micrograms/day while subjects consumed the hospital diet, and fell to 3 micrograms/day by day 6 on vitamin K-free diet. Prothrombin times remained within the normal range throughout the study. Suppression of vitamin K-dependent clotting factor biosynthesis was evident by decreased factor VII levels in seven of the volunteers and by an increased concentration of des-gamma-carboxy (abnormal) prothrombin in 21 of the volunteers. The changes occurred in the control subjects and in subjects receiving all nine of the 10 antibiotics with no consistent pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Gelsolin is a newly recognized actin-binding protein of plasma that severs actin filaments. The concentration of plasma gelsolin was measured by three independent methods: an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and two functional assays based on the ability of gelsolin to accelerate the polymerization of actin (a \"nucleating\" assay) or to sever preformed actin filaments (a \"cutting\" assay). The gelsolin level in 56 samples of human plasma ranged between 100 and 330 micrograms/ml. The mean plasma concentrations measured by the different assays were ELISA, 207 micrograms/ml; nucleating assay, 233 micrograms/ml; cutting assay, 247 micrograms/ml. The mean serum level of gelsolin was found to be 24% lower than that of plasma when paired samples were examined (183 micrograms/ml). The difference between plasma and serum gelsolin concentrations can be accounted for by a direct interaction between gelsolin and fibrin as shown by the binding of radiolabeled gelsolin to clots made from purified fibrinogen. Further, unlabeled gelsolin inhibits the binding of the labeled species to fibrin, but hemoglobin and albumin do not. Fibrin oligomers, but not fibrinogen, alter the sedimentation characteristics of radiolabeled gelsolin in sucrose gradients. The amount of gelsolin incorporated into the clot is increased if the clots are made in the presence of actin filaments or fibronectin. Thus, serum levels of gelsolin are lower than plasma levels because of an interaction between gelsolin and fibrin clots.\r"

  ".W": "The nature of the barrier between blood and peritoneal dialysate was studied by determining peritoneal solute transport rates as a function of molecular size using neutral dextrans, polymers with different molecular weights but uniform chemical composition. Transport rates for creatinine, p-aminohippurate (PAH), and neutral dextran (3,000 to 50,000 daltons) were measured during peritoneal dialysis in the awake rabbit using sequential isotonic and hypertonic dialysis solutions. The permeability-area product (PA) for the peritoneum was determined from the dependence of the dialysate concentration on time during the isotonic exchange. The dependence of PA on molecular size showed no additional hindrance by the peritoneum as molecules of larger size were considered. By accounting for convective solute transport during the hypertonic exchange, the solute reflection coefficient (sigma) and PA were simultaneously determined. The values of PA for creatinine and PAH were similar to those determined during the isotonic exchange, and sigma values for creatinine and PAH were 0.18 +/- 0.20 and 0.14 +/- 0.14, respectively. Dextran sigma values (3,000 to 22,000 daltons) were near unity (0.9 to 1.0) and relatively independent of molecular size, suggesting substantial hindrance to convective transport for this size range. This work demonstrates that the paradoxical transport properties of an \"open\" diffusive yet \"tight\" convective peritoneal barrier are primarily reflective of the unique structural properties of this biologic tissue and are not related to test solute heterogeneity.\r"

  ".W": "Because spermine and spermidine have caused hypothermia in rodent experiments, we tested the hypothesis that these polyamines accumulate in some elderly convalescent patients and that this accumulation could predispose to lower body temperature. Fourteen healthy young, seven healthy older, and 47 convalescent elderly subjects had serum spermine and spermidine concentrations measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The mean +/- SD spermine values were 18 +/- 10, 24 +/- 15, and 40 +/- 54 ng/ml, respectively. The values for spermidine were 28 +/- 10, 38 +/- 29, and 76 +/- 46 ng/ml, respectively. The differences between the young and convalescent elderly were statistically significant for both compounds. Rectal temperatures were measured in 39 elderly convalescent subjects with a thermometer designed for accuracy at low temperatures. These subjects were stratified into a warm and cool half based on a median rectal temperature of 37 degrees C. There was an association between having high spermine levels and being in the cool half of the elderly convalescent group (P less than 0.05). We conclude that some elderly convalescent patients have high levels of spermidine and spermine and that these high spermine levels may be associated with lower body temperature.\r"

  ".W": "Skeletal muscle activation is believed to be important in the maintenance of upper airway patency. To determine where and how muscles affect pharyngeal stability, we assessed in heavily anesthetized, ventilated dogs, the negative pressure required to close the nasopharynx and the passage from the oral to the pharyngeal airway before and after electrical stimulation of six pairs of upper airway muscles: the sternohyoid, sternothyroid, ceratohyoid, thyrohyoid, genioglossus, and geniohyoid. Before muscle stimulation, the pressures required to close the nasopharynx and the oral passage were -9.8 +/- 2.3 (mean +/- SEM) and -4.9 +/- 1.9 cm H2O, respectively. Submaximal electrical stimulation of each of the six muscle pairs caused consistent and substantial improvements in nasopharynx closing pressure. In contrast, the stabilizing actions of these muscles on the oral passage was less consistent and smaller in magnitude. Using pressure in the sealed upper airway as an index of forces acting on the airway, we found a strong association between the effect of muscle stimulation on the closing pressure and the effect of muscle stimulation on producing a dilating force on the airway. We conclude that muscles in the anterior and lateral pharyngeal wall improve nasopharynx stability to a greater extent than oral passage stability and that the action by any of these six muscle pairs improves airway stability through their ability to dilate the upper airway.\r"

The hearing was improved in all patients. In 92 per cent of the patients an optimal hearing gain was found after an observation time of 1 to 4 years. Five patients required re-operation during the observation time. The small fenestra technique and the Fisch prosthesis were considered optimal in respect to technical difficulty, hearing improvement and complication rate. There was no sensorineural hearing loss in this series of patients. The absence of serious complications makes it reasonable to operate on both ears in patients with bilateral hearing loss. The results are as good in elderly people as in younger people. Therefore the operation can be offered for patients in all age groups.\r"

The charts were abstracted for demographic factors, symptoms, physical findings, laboratory data, final diagnosis, and number of visits for abdominal pain. The final diagnosis was documented by radiologic, laboratory, surgical, or pathologic specimen confirmation except for the following diagnoses: acute gastroenteritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and abdominal pain, etiology undetermined. No cause for the abdominal pain was found for approximately one half of the cases. Most patients were female even when gynecologic problems were excluded. Nine percent of abdominal pain patients were admitted to the hospital for evaluation or surgery. An average of 1.8 tests were ordered per patient. Almost one half of the patients were seen only once for the problem. The results suggest that a large percentage of the patients who present with abdominal pain have a self-limited illness for which no definitive diagnosis is found.\r"

Patients with acute myocardial infarctions or cardiac arrhythmias had better survival rates (26 percent and 19 percent, respectively) than with other diagnosis (5 percent), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Patients who survived to leave the hospital did not suffer any mental loss from the arrest. General guidelines for withholding CPR based on the present study and a review of the literature are presented.\r"

Compared with matched controls, their rate of office visits and charges incurred was about 50 percent greater (.58 visits per month vs .41 visits per month; $23.28 per month vs $14.44 per month). Their charts were thicker (7 cm vs 3.6 cm) and heavier (3076 g vs 1843 g) and had more diagnoses (85 vs 51) than controls. The physicians of the somatizers were significantly less satisfied with the care rendered to them than to the controls (P less than .01).

These studies are based on the unexamined assumption that patients want their physicians to treat psychosocial disorders; thus, underrecognition is examined by analyzing characteristics of physicians and medical settings. Patient characteristics, particularly attitudes about the appropriateness of seeking help for psychosocial problems in primary care, have not been examined in relationship to underrecognition. This study directly focuses on patient attitudes about appropriateness of requesting care for psychosocial difficulties, the extent to which patients discuss difficulties with their physicians, and the degree to which physician recognition is explained by these patient characteristics. The study sample of 883 adult patients was drawn from 23 primary care practices. Over 70 percent of patients find it appropriate to turn to their primary care physicians for help with emotional distress, family problems, life stress, behavioral problems, and sexual dysfunction; however, only one fifth to one third of patients who have experienced difficulties have discussed these problems with their primary care providers. Attitudes about appropriateness are significantly related to physician recognition of psychiatric symptoms and family difficulties but account for limited variance in levels of recognition.\r"

The CAGE responses were also compared with other information in the patients' charts to assess how frequently this screening test might support a diagnosis of problem drinking. The incidence of problem drinking identified by the CAGE was 3.2 percent, compared with the expected 9.8 percent level (P = .0039). The CAGE questionnaire proved to be no better than a simple self-report of alcohol consumption (which demonstrated an incidence of 4 percent), and failed to identify two patients with histories of alcohol abuse as noted in their charts. CAGE, when used as a part of a larger health questionnaire, thus failed to identify the anticipated number of patients with drinking problems.\r"

In some cases, values have been as high as 10 micrograms/L. Levels as high as 20 micrograms/L and 80 micrograms/g can be found in bile and meconium. Because of the magnitude of this interference, it is essential that methods be developed for measuring digoxin in the presence of DLIS. This is particularly important when such analyses are required in forensic science cases of suspected digoxin toxicity. This report outlines the high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) methods that we used in assessing the relative contribution made by digoxin, its metabolites, and DLIS to serum and tissue digoxin concentrations obtained by RIA in a forensic pediatric case of suspected digoxin toxicity.\r"

Unlike a previous report, the current study showed very poor sperm recovery (maximum of 25% during the first postcoital day). The observed results roughly correlate with the incidence of sperm noted on screening of large numbers of routine clinical Pap smears in a private reference laboratory. Routine Pap smears can detect sperm but do not appear to be an ideal method to substantiate recent sexual intercourse.\r"

It is suggested that the hair examination form resulting from the responses to the questionnaire recently distributed by the authors and also the discussions at Quantico (Proceedings of the International Symposium on Forensic Hair Comparisons, 25-27 June 1985, Quantico VA) should be used to facilitate the collection of the data which will be necessary to enable a likelihood ratio statistic to be estimated effectively.\r"

  ".W": "Transillumination of bite mark evidence is a technique whereby the presence of subcutaneous hemorrhage can be visualized without having to section through the bite mark. This is a nondestructive technique. The presence of subcutaneous hemorrhage indicates that the bite mark was inflicted before death or perimortem. In addition, the technique proves invaluable in determining the orientation of the bite mark. This is particularly helpful when a bite mark is poorly defined, barely visible, or obscured by other superimposed bite marks or traumatic injury patterns. Observation of the subcutaneous hemorrhage by transillumination may provide an indication of the horizontal alignment of the aggressor's dentition since the force of occlusion used in delivery of the bite mark is a factor in the presence and intensity of the hemorrhage. Transillumination supports a conclusion that there may be two types of hemorrhagic patterns in bite mark evidence. Lastly, when transillumination is used in conjunction with visual aids, it can facilitate communication of bite mark evidence to other expert witnesses or to the jury in trial presentation or both.\r"

Problems posed by the nature of psychiatric illness, as these relate more broadly to the theory and enterprise of diagnosis and classification, are reviewed. The report addresses the nature of category structure models in psychiatry, the differences between the classification of illness and natural objects, the influence of symbolic/cultural/historical factors in psychiatric illness ascertainment, different parameters of a measurement approach to psychiatric diagnosis, and the problem of co-occurrence of psychiatric illness. Whenever possible, the rationale and system of DSM-III is used for purposes of discussion and illustration. The aim of the report is to outline and review these and related factors to conceptualize the enterprise of psychiatric illness diagnosis in a broad comparative social medical frame of reference.\r"

A first step in establishing the validity of diagnoses is to establish the validity of the criteria used to assess each diagnosis. The content validity of diagnostic criteria was investigated in relation to the larger set of potential criteria culled from the psychiatric literature. For each DSM-III axis II diagnosis, a panel of clinicians rated how prototypical each potential criterion was of the diagnosis in question. The results reveal problems with the organization and content of the criteria for most diagnoses. Many DSM-III criteria are composed of several statements linked by conjunctions or disjunctions. These component statements often received markedly different ratings, suggesting that criteria should be single statements. For most diagnoses, traits not included in DSM-III received higher ratings than did some DSM-III criteria. Suggestions are made to improve the distinctiveness and content validity of paranoid, schizoid, antisocial, borderline, avoidant, dependent, and compulsive personality disorders. The results for schizotypal personality disorder suggest that many clinicians are uncertain about this diagnosis. These findings provide a systematic way to modify definitions that contrasts with the more arbitrary ways in which diagnoses have previously been defined and redefined.\r"

As compared with nonrefusers, the refusers had changed schools more often, were rated as more dependent, had more school-related fears, and were perceived by their parents as more difficult to manage. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that school refusal status could be predicted by both situational and personality variables including the child's fear level, dependency, depression, frequency of school changes, history of refusal in the family, and other variables. Refusal onset frequently coincided with situational stress (e.g., the beginning of the school year, a new school or teacher, or trouble with a teacher or peers). Categories of refusal resembled those of other studies and included adjustment reaction, school phobia, and emotional disturbance. In the future, these risk factors can be used to identify and treat potential school refusers.\r"

However, it has not been much used in controlled research, probably because its reliability and validity have been questioned by critics. The authors have used Goal Attainment Scaling as one of a number of outcome measures in a research project on the effect of family intervention on inpatients. In the course of doing so, they have developed guidelines for gathering information, constructing goal scales, selecting expected outcome levels, and categorizing subsequent outcome data. They believe that these guidelines have clinical integrity and that their use would improve the reliability of goal attainment scaling without detracting from its value as an individualized measure. With these modifications, Goal Attainment Scaling can be made more systematic and therefore more reliable without losing its intrinsic value as an individually targeted outcome measure.\r"

Admission and discharge data were obtained from NIDA-CODAP on 2,532 adolescents in the 22 programs. A partial cross-validation study was conducted by analyzing separately for two annual client subsamples. The program, not the individual client, was the unit of analysis. When three differences between programs in their client populations were \"partialed out\" the following characteristics of programs were found to predict positively to outcome (a lower treatment failure rate) to a statistically significant degree: the number of years that the counselors had worked in the programs; the number of volunteer staff in direct service (client contact); the proportion of clients receiving bodily and mental relaxation techniques: the counselors' perceptions that their programs accept or encourage relatively more spontaneous personal expressiveness, including expression of anger by clients, in staff-client relationships, but encourage less client \"autonomy\" (to be self-sufficient and independent with regard to making their own decisions); the counselors report that providing practical assistance in solving clients' real-life problems is useful. There was a high degree of replication of these findings across the two annual subsamples of clients. These findings for adolescents in residential programs are compared with findings reported in a parallel study of treatment outcome for adolescents in outpatient programs.\r"

  ".W": "There is evidence that adult substance abusers tend to have high rates of psychiatric symptomatology and diagnosable psychiatric disorders and that those with more severe psychiatric problems show lower levels of improvement. This paper examines whether these same two findings also hold for adolescent substance abusers. The outcome of treatment, in a day treatment center in a private vocational high school setting, for 130 court-referred substance-abusing delinquent boys aged 14 to 18 years was studied in relation to their psychic symptomatology at admission, as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory and the Emotional Reaction Inventory. The unexpected finding, although not conclusive, shows that there is a slight tendency among these young clients for those who report more psychiatric symptoms to improve more, rather than less, with treatment. For example, a greater score on the borderline psychotic subscale of the Emotional Reaction Scale predicted to more improvement as measured by reduction in drug use. A response set explanation was postulated for this finding: those clients who were more self-evaluative and more open and self-revealing about their disturbing inner thoughts and feelings might have been more trusting, more ready, and better motivated for counseling. The following are some possible explanations for the fact that the findings are different from those of some studies reported for adult substance abusers: adolescent drug abusers have, or are aware of having, or report, less psychiatric symptomatology, than adult abusers or addicts; our study sample included only court-referred delinquents; and there are differences in research methodology, specifically in the types of instruments and measures used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Consistent with our previous reports, platelet membranes from the Alzheimer's disease group exhibited a significant increase in membrane fluidity, as reflected by the rotation rate and fluorescence anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) at 37 degrees C. Moreover, membrane fluidity was correlated with the frequency of atypical platelets visualized by electron microscopy. Since internal platelet membranes have been reported to be more fluid than external platelet membranes, these and other results presented suggest that the increase in platelet membrane fluidity associated with Alzheimer's disease may be the result of a dysregulation of platelet membrane biosynthesis.\r"

Elevations of phosphodiesters were also observed, but they tended to reflect the degree of neuropathological change. We postulate that the 31P NMR findings represent molecular alterations with corresponding metabolic correlates which either antedate or occur in the absence of changes in cellular morphology or structure. As such the 31P NMR findings may reflect a subcellular \"molecular neuropathology.\"\r"

Scrapie is a CNS degenerative disorder caused by a novel infectious particle or prion. Golgi impregnation studies showed that neurons in the scrapie-infected brains of hamsters contained varicose swellings and diminished numbers of dendritic spines. In order to ascertain whether or not these differences were statistically significant, quantitative methods were applied to brain samples from scrapie-infected hamsters and compared to uninfected controls. Golgi impregnated layer III pyramidal neurons from both motor and visual cortex exhibited two types of changes in infected animals. First, loss of dendritic spines on the apical shaft of both motor and visual neurons were found from 50 to 200 microns from the cell body (p less than 0.001). Second, spherical varicosities on dendritic stalks ranging from 7 to 25 microns in diameter were found. The average number of varicosities per cell was 18.1 in infected animals with varicosities on dendrites of controls numbering less than 3 per cell. Less than 2% of the control cells exhibited these varicosities, while greater than 80% of the scrapie dendrites exhibited varicosities. These changes in scrapie are similar to those reported in Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Alzheimer's disease in human patients.\r"

Subsequently a similar protective effect was produced in animals by injecting a single dose of dexamethasone, one hour before the induction of hypernatremia.

  ".W": "Teniposide (VM-26) is an effective anticancer drug usually administered as a short infusion in doses of 150 to 165 mg/m2. The objectives of the trial reported here were to evaluate clinical responses and assess pharmacokinetic parameters as a determinant of outcome when VM-26 was administered as a 72-hour continuous infusion (CI) with doses escalated from 300 to 750 mg/m2 per course. Twenty-eight patients with recurrent leukemia, lymphoma, or neuroblastoma received 53 courses of CI VM-26 and 16 had measurable responses. There were two partial remissions and one stable disease among seven neuroblastoma patients and 13 of 21 leukemia/lymphoma patients had oncolytic responses (greater than or equal to 75% decrease in circulating blasts). Toxicity included moderate to severe mucositis and myelosuppression. Pharmacokinetic parameters determined during 35 courses administered to 23 patients were highly variable. Clearance (CI) ranged between 3.7 and 43.8 ml/min/m2, resulting in VM-26 plasma concentrations from 2.8 to 30.6 mg/L across all dose levels. The interpatient pharmacokinetic variability reflected in CI and VM-26 steady state concentrations (Css), obscured any dose-response relationship. However, when pharmacokinetic parameters for responding and nonresponding patients were compared, statistically significant relationships were observed. For responders, the mean Css was 15.2 mg/L and mean CI was 12.1 mL/min/m2; for nonresponders, mean Css was 6.2 mg/L (P less than .01) and mean CI was 21.3 mL/min/m2 (P less than .05). Thus, patients with higher CI and lower Css were less likely to respond. Clinical responses occurred in ten of ten patients with Css greater than 12 mg/L, and only five of 13 patients with Css less than 12 mg/L (P less than .01). In this study, interpatient pharmacokinetic variability yielded a four- to sixfold difference in intensity of systemic exposure (Css) within the same dose level, which was an important determinant of clinical response. These data indicate that achieving a VM-26 target concentration for individual patients could ensure an increased intensity of systemic exposure in patients with a high CI and improve the likelihood of effective therapy.\r"

Pretreatment characteristics were analyzed to assess their influence on survival and freedom from relapse (FFR). The two most important disease characteristics predictive of relapse were the number and type of B symptoms present and the mediastinal mass ratio (MMR). Patients with both fevers and weight loss had a 7-year survival and FFR of only 57% and 48%, respectively. The poor prognosis in this group was apparent for treatment with either radiation (XRT) alone or combined modality therapy (CMT). Patients with night sweats only had no adverse effect of B symptoms on outcome. Patients with a MMR greater than 1/3 had a 7-year FFR of only 58% after XRT, but 79% after CMT (P = .12). The 7-year survivals for these patients were 85% and 88%, respectively. CMT improved the FFR of the entire group of 180 patients when compared with XRT (7-year FFR 86% and 74%, respectively, P = .02); however, survival in the two treatment groups was similar (88% and 89%). Among patients treated with radiation alone, there was a similar survival and FFR irrespective of whether pelvic irradiation was included in the initial treatment fields.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical records of 1,616 patients with previously untreated Hodgkin's disease were reviewed. Forty-nine of these patients (3%) presented with disease limited to sites below the diaphragm and underwent laparotomy as part of their staging evaluation. The clinical and histological characteristics of this group of patients with subdiaphragmatic Hodgkin's disease are compared with those who presented with supradiaphragmatic disease. Splenectomy in 47 patients revealed splenic involvement in 16 (39%), and bulky splenic involvement (more than five gross nodules) in ten (24%). The final pathological stage (PS) distribution was PS I = 8, PS II = 37, PS IV = 4. No clinical stage (CS) IA patients and only two of 20 patients with negative paraaortic nodes on lymphogram had splenic involvement in contrast to eight of nine CS IIB patients. Freedom from relapse and survival were similar to patients with equivalent stage supradiaphragmatic disease. Splenic involvement and bulky splenic involvement were associated with a significantly decreased survival. Twelve out of 44 PS IA to IIB patients relapsed. In eight of these 12 patients, relapse was limited to sites above the diaphragm and another two patients relapsed both above and below the diaphragm. Patients who received total lymphoid irradiation were less likely to relapse above the diaphragm than patients who received no supradiaphragmatic irradiation. We recommend that CS IA and IIA patients with subdiaphragmatic disease undergo staging laparotomy and receive supradiaphragmatic irradiation as part of their treatment. Laparotomy may not be necessary for CS IIB patients who are at high risk for splenic disease if chemotherapy is planned as part of their treatment program.\r"

Four patients with a residual mass were observed without surgery. One patient with a residual mass greater than or equal to 3 cm progressed with biopsy-proven seminoma. Therefore, six of 14 patients (42%) with a residual mass greater than or equal to 3 cm had viable residual tumor. Eighteen patients had no residual mass after chemotherapy. Ten of these patients had surgery or biopsy; none had viable tumor, but two have relapsed. Eight patients were observed and none have relapsed. Advanced seminoma patients with a residual mass greater than or equal to 3 cm after chemotherapy are at high risk for residual viable tumor. Additional therapy is indicated for these patients. For patients with normal imaging studies or a residual mass less than 3 cm, close observation without surgery is generally possible.\r"

After a median observation time of 36 months, 33 patients are alive with no evidence of disease (NED). Fifteen additional patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy due to relapsing seminoma after initial radiotherapy (group 2). Thirteen patients obtained a CR, and two a PR. Patients from group 1 lived significantly longer after the start of chemotherapy than those from group 2. The rate and severity of the treatment-related complications were comparable in both groups. The most frequent nonfatal side effects of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy were Raynaud-like phenomena, polyneuropathy, and myelosuppression. Four patients developed fatal complications (septicemia, bone marrow aplasia). In three of 12 patients with evaluable postchemotherapy histology, vital malignant seminoma was found. Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy in advanced seminoma patients is highly effective, but includes a significant risk of severe complications. Less toxic treatment regimens should be explored, at least for patients who have less advanced tumors (stage IIb/limited stage IIc).\r"

We did not design the trial to be a comparative assessment of the two regimens. Among 19 patients treated with cimetidine, 300 mg orally four times daily, there was one complete response of extensive pleural and pulmonary metastases for 16+ months and two partial regressions of soft tissue lesions for 7 and 21+ months, respectively. Among 21 patients treated with the combination regimen, there was only one partial response in soft tissue for 1 month. The median times to progression and death were 1.4 and 6 months, respectively, for cimetidine, and 1.3 and 4 months, respectively, from the combination of PALA plus L-alanosine. Among patients who progressed on initial treatment, there were no responses in 12 who received crossover therapy with cimetidine and 11 with the combination regimen. Two patients treated with the combination program had severe stomatitis, two developed renal failure, and one had severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Recognizing the limitations of small sample size, these early observations suggest that cimetidine may have intriguing implications in the management of disseminated malignant melanoma.\r"

Patients demonstrating complete (CR), partial (PR), or minor (MR) responses or stabilization were continued on a maintenance regimen of the highest tolerated dose administered three times weekly until disease progression. Doses administered during maintenance were individually determined as the maximum dose that resulted in only mild toxicity. No CRs were achieved. Partial responses were observed in 23% of the patients with a median duration of response of 8.0 months (range, 1 to 17+). The majority of interferon side effects were seen during the induction phase, which was also the period requiring the most frequent adjustments in dose. In comparison to another study using similar toxicity criteria, overall toxicity was reduced in severity, most probably due to the study design, which allowed individual tailoring of doses. The use of an initial induction phase employing rapid dose escalation followed by a well-tolerated maintenance phase appeared to be a reasonable strategy. The therapeutic results to date represent a modest advance. An optimal dosage, route, and schedule for interferon administration for metastatic renal cancer is not yet clearly established.\r"

A significant increase in the CSF concentration of HVA was observed in patients with brain tumors (neuroectodermal), neuroblastoma (intracranial or cranial metastases), and retinoblastoma when compared with age-matched controls. In contrast, HMPG and VMA concentrations did not differ from controls except in patients with neuroblastoma (intracranial or cranial metastases) and brain tumors (neuroectodermal) who had significant elevations in HMPG and VMA, respectively. An inverse correlation was noted between the CSF concentration of HVA and clinical response to therapy. Nonresponding patients exhibited increases in HVA when compared with pretreatment values. These data suggest that the quantitative determination of catecholamine metabolites in lumbar CSF is an effective method for diagnosing intracranial tumors of neuroectodermal origin and assessing their response to therapy.\r"

Eighty-seven percent of patients initially complained of headache, gait disturbance, and/or dizziness. At time of diagnosis, 92% of patients with solitary cerebellar metastases and 74% of the overall series complained of headache and/or difficulty walking. In three of four cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was superior to x-ray computed tomography (CT) in detecting the cerebellar lesions. Several patients acutely deteriorated during evaluation or at the initiation of radiation therapy. We conclude that a cancer patient presenting with headache and gait difficulty with or without nausea/vomiting and dizziness should promptly undergo head CT scanning, and that MRI is useful even if CT is negative. In addition, we recommend that patients with documented cerebellar metastases receive high-dose glucocorticoid therapy for 48 to 72 hours before beginning radiation therapy. The presence of symptomatic hydrocephalus or failure to respond to glucocorticoids initially are particularly ominous features that may be best managed by early neurosurgical consultation before beginning radiation therapy.\r"

Animals were randomly assigned to either treatment group (10 cats per group), and all personnel were blind as to which animals received vehicle or drug. The intensive 48-hour dosing regimen was designed to maintain therapeutic tissue levels of MP and consisted of an initial 30 mg/kg intravenous bolus of MP; 2 and 6 hours later additional 15 mg/kg MP doses were administered by intravenous bolus. Immediately following the bolus given at 6 hours, a continuous MP infusion of 2.5 mg/kg/hr was started. The infusion was stopped abruptly at 48 hours with no dose tapering. Animals in the vehicle group received an equivalent volume of MP vehicle. The total MP dose administered over 48 hours was 165 mg/kg. Animals were evaluated weekly for neurological recovery based upon a 12-point functional scale which assessed general mobility, running, and stair-climbing. Mean recovery scores at 1 month after injury (+/- standard error of the mean) were: vehicle group (seven cats) 3.7 +/- 0.9, and MP group (10 cats) 8.7 +/- 0.2; (p less than 0.001). Histological evaluation of the spinal cords revealed a strong negative correlation between neurological recovery and size of the spinal cord cavity at 1 month (r = -0.88). Three of 10 animals in the vehicle group became ill and had to be dropped from the study, whereas all of the 10 MP-treated animals survived in excellent health. The results demonstrate the therapeutic effectiveness and low incidence of side effects associated with an intensive MP dose regimen for treatment of experimental spinal cord injury.\r"

Ocular metastases were visible in the anterior chamber in 80% of animals 3 to 12 days after the infusion of VX2 tumor cell suspension. All rabbits deteriorated neurologically or died by Day 15 after the inoculation. Multiple metastases were demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging as early as 5 to 7 days after infusion of the tumor cells and were confirmed at autopsy. This technique models hematogenous metastases to the brain and eye and is useful in evaluating the response of metastases to chemotherapy and radiation therapy directed to the brain and eye.\r"

  ".W": "Fluid percussion models produce brain injury by rapidly injecting fluid volumes into the cranial cavity. The authors have systematically examined the effects of varying magnitudes of fluid percussion injury in the rat on neurological, systemic physiological, and histopathological changes. Acute neurological experiments showed that fluid percussion injury in 53 rats produced either irreversible apnea and death or transient apnea (lasting 54 seconds or less) and reversible suppression of postural and nonpostural function (lasting 60 minutes or less). As the magnitude if injury increased, the mortality rate and the duration of suppression of somatomotor reflexes increased. Unlike other rat models in which concussive brain injury is produced by impact, convulsions were observed in only 13% of survivors. Transient apnea was probably not associated with a significant hypoxic insult to animals that survived. Ten rats that sustained a moderate magnitude of injury (2.9 atm) exhibited chronic locomotor deficits that persisted for 4 to 8 days. Systemic physiological experiments in 20 rats demonstrated that all levels of injury studied produced acute systemic hypertension, bradycardia, and increased plasma glucose levels. Hypertension with subsequent hypotension resulted from higher magnitudes of injury. The durations of hypertension and suppression of amplitude on electroencephalography were related to the magnitudes of injury. While low levels of injury produced no significant histopathological alterations, higher magnitudes produced subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhage and, with increasing survival, necrotic change and cavitation. These data demonstrate that fluid percussion injury in the rat reproduces many of the features of head injury observed in other models and species. Thus, this animal model could represent a useful experimental approach to studies of pathological changes similar to those seen in human head injury.\r"

The method involves a linear scalp incision of varying length and orientation and a circumferential craniotomy of variable size and shape centered about a single burr hole. While providing for rapid exposure with reduced blood loss, the vascular integrity of the wound is also better preserved, allowing for rapid healing of the scalp. This technique provides satisfactory unilateral exposures of most cerebral sites not located in the vicinity of the frontal sinus or the sphenoid wing.\r"

Further evidence for the presence of low perfusion surrounding the AVM, emphasizing the risk of normal perfusion pressure breakthrough, is provided by cortical perfusion pressure, cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF), and stable xenon computerized tomography CBF measurements. The staged approach to giant AVM management is a proposed method to render AVM's that were previously considered inoperable or marginally operable into totally excisable lesions, while maintaining an acceptable level of morbidity and mortality.\r"

There were peaks in the incidence of rebleeding at the end of the 2nd and 3rd weeks. Sudden loss of consciousness occurred in 35 patients, preceded in one-third of them by headache. A sudden increase in headache was a symptom of rebleeding in only one patient. Loss of brain-stem reflexes was recorded in 13 patients, respiratory arrest in six, and both symptoms in eight patients. Apnea was temporary in 11 patients. Rebleeding occurred as gross intraventricular hemorrhage in 20 patients, as a space-occupying hematoma in four, as both types of hemorrhage in three, and as a purely subarachnoid hemorrhage in 12. The location of the rebleed could not be inferred from the clinical features. Rebleeding was fatal in 51% of cases (two of 12 patients with a purely subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 18 of the other 27 patients (p less than 0.005)). The risk of rebleeding could not be predicted from the patients' clinical condition on admission or from the amount of subarachnoid blood identified on the initial CT scan. The risk of further rebleeding was significantly increased in survivors of a first rebleed (47%: p less than 0.01). Only seven (18%) of the 39 patients with rebleeding had survived at 3 months after the initial hemorrhage.\r"

This is a higher incidence than has been reported before and may be explained by the prospective nature of the present study, the long follow-up period, and the inclusion of patients with mild bilateral symptoms. Multiple sclerosis is the most common predisposing factor and occurred in 18% of those with bilateral trigeminal neuralgia. Although patients with bilateral trigeminal neuralgia were more likely to have had prior surgery than those with unilateral neuralgia, they did not have a higher recurrence rate following treatment. Percutaneous RFE of the retrogasserian rootlets and gasserian ganglion, with or without glycerol, is effective in managing patients whose pain is intractable to medical therapy. The preservation of most trigeminal sensory and motor functions, the low morbidity rate, and the ability to repeat the procedure are particularly advantageous for patients with bilateral involvement.\r"

Neurological findings were documented preoperatively and at 1 month, 1 year, and 5 to 10 years postoperatively. A questionnaire using subjective and objective data was given to patients at 1 year and 5 to 10 years postoperatively. An 83% long-term follow-up result was obtained. At a minimum of 5 years postoperatively, 62% of patients had complete relief of back pain and 62% had complete relief of leg pain; 96% were pleased that they had submitted to surgery and 93% were able to return to work. Nine percent reported that their back pain at 5 to 10 years was as severe as or worse than preoperatively and 11% reported that their leg pain was as severe as or worse than preoperatively. The reoperation rate was 18%. Preoperative factors found to be significantly associated with outcome at 1 year postoperatively were not significantly associated with outcome at 5 to 10 years postoperatively. The results of lumbosacral discectomy appear favorable as evaluated in this study. Preoperative factors useful as predictors of short-term outcome are much less reliable when considering the long-term results.\r"

There were no postoperative cerebrospinal fluid fistulae and no neurological complications. In one patient, a human-derived fibrin adhesive was used for dural repair. The postoperative cosmetic results were excellent and no problems relating to malocclusion were reported. This approach may have advantages when dealing with other diseases in or around the clivus.\r"

  ".W": "A neoadjuvant (preradiotherapy) chemotherapy regimen consisting of either cyclophosphamide alone (60 to 80 mg/kg) or a modified multidrug regimen (vinblastine, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, and cisplatin) was administered to 15 newly diagnosed patients with histologically confirmed, fully staged, primary germ-cell tumors (GCT's) of the central nervous system (CNS). There were 11 patients with germinomas and four with non-germinoma malignant GCT's. There were six females and nine males, whose median age was 13 years (range 4 months to 24 years). Seven germinoma patients (64%) had disseminated disease. For the germinoma patients, the subsequent radiotherapy dose was modified based on the response to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and craniospinal radiotherapy was given only to those with disseminated CNS disease at diagnosis. Ten of the 11 germinoma patients had complete disappearance of all evaluable disease after two courses of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide in eight and multidrug in three) and one had a partial response. The planned dose of radiotherapy to the primary tumor was reduced from 5500 to 3000 rads, and the craniospinal dose was lowered from 3600 to 2000 rads. Ten patients remain in continuous disease-free remission 20+ to 89+ months after diagnosis (median follow-up period 47 months). All four patients with non-germinoma GCT's received the multidrug regimen, and two fo three patients with evaluable disease had a partial response. High-dose regional and craniospinal radiotherapy was administered thereafter, but only two patients remain in their first remission. Previously untreated germinoma is a highly chemosensitive disease and the neoadjuvant treatment strategy permits the identification of active chemotherapy regimens in newly diagnosed patients. Patients who have complete responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy tolerate a significant radiotherapy dose reduction without compromising long-term survival, thereby allowing a reduction of some of the late effects of therapeutic radiation. Germinomas tend to disseminate early in the course of the disease and a pre-therapy staging evaluation permits individualized radiotherapy treatment planning.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that nimodipine, a potent calcium-channel antagonist that causes significant cerebrovascular dilatation, may improve neurological outcome after acute experimental permanent focal cerebral ischemia when given before or immediately after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in various animals. The authors describe the effect of nimodipine on cerebral ischemia in a rat model. At 1, 4, or 6 hours after occlusion of the MCA, rats were treated in a double-blind technique with either nimodipine, placebo, or saline. Neurological and neuropathological evaluation was performed at 24 hours. Neurological outcome was better in rats treated with nimodipine 1, 4, or 6 hours after occlusion (p less than 0.001, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05 respectively), and the size of areas of infarction was statistically smaller in nimodipine-treated groups (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.05, respectively) when compared with control rats treated with saline or placebo. The best neurological outcome and the smallest area of infarction were found in nimodipine-treated rats 1 hour after occlusion. Compared with controls, the size of the periphery of the infarcted area was smaller in nimodipine-treated rats. The results show that nimodipine improves neurological outcome and decreases the size of infarction when administered up to 6 hours after ischemic insult. These results suggest a possible mechanism of action of nimodipine on the \"penumbra\" of the ischemic area.\r"

In 13 cats in which ventricular size conformed to previously established norms for duration of hydrocephalus, there were no demonstrable gradients of pressure at any of the sites of measurement according to one-way analysis of variance (p greater than 0.05). The mean (+/- standard error of the mean) peak and trough pressures (in mm Hg) at each site were: ventricle, 12.7 +/- 0.7 and 12.0 +/- 0.6; cisterna magna, 12.9 +/- 0.8 and 12.3 +/- 0.7; subarachnoid space, 12.7 +/- 0.8 and 12.1 +/- 0.7; brain tissue, 12.9 +/- 0.9 and 12.4 +/- 0.9; and sagittal sinus, 13.1 +/- 0.8 and 11.9 +/- 0.8.

  ".W": "Plateau waves reflect both dilatation of the cerebral vessels and an increase in the cerebral blood volume under increased intracranial pressure (ICP). They are often associated with changes in arterial blood pressure (BP) and respiration, suggesting a role of the brain stem in their development. In experiments conducted on dogs in which intracranial hypertension was induced by occluding the neck veins, the authors stimulated the brain-stem reticular formation in the medulla oblongata and caudal pons to identify the brain sites that produce plateau-like responses. A rise in ICP was observed following stimulation of most areas of the brain stem and was associated with changes in arterial BP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), respiration, and pulse rate. The stimuli delivered to the medial reticular formation of the caudal medulla caused an arterial depressor response, a decrease in CPP and CBF, suppressed ventilation, and bradycardia; these responses were similar in many respects to plateau waves observed in clinical practice and almost corresponded to the depressor region of the vasomotor center. It is hypothesized that the medullary depressor area may play a role in eliciting cerebral vasomotor reaction concerned with the development of plateau waves in a state of increased ICP.\r"

This analysis revealed that the patient's age and tumor enhancement on computerized tomography (CT) with intravenous administration of contrast material were the only factors that influenced survival time. Compared to prior studies, the patients in this report more frequently had normal preoperative neurological examinations and total resection of their lesions. These differences may have resulted from the use of CT scans over the past decade. Earlier diagnosis and improvement definition of the tumor location and extent are two reasons why the use of CT scans may have affected outcome statistics. A re-examination of treatment methods and the timing of those treatments is needed to define the optimal management of these lesions.\r"

The results of this study support earlier studies on the application of chronic intrathecal morphine for intractable cancer pain.

There was a cumulative effect of repeated head injuries: the more head injuries that were suffered, the more symptoms and more inferior performance were noted. Age at the time of the accident did not influence the occurrence of reported sequelae. Alcohol intake and smoking were powerful factors confounding the postinjury picture, but after taking these factors into account the results were generally the same. The study indicates that head injuries with impaired consciousness, no matter how short, are capable of causing permanent sequelae.\r"

Subsequently, this new monitor was compared to a concurrently functioning ICP monitor in 15 adult and five pediatric patients. This clinical experience also confirmed the safety, accuracy, and reliability of the device. Since these initial studies, this monitor has been used to routinely measure ICP in a large number of adult and pediatric patients. The monitor has functioned well, and there have been no complications related to its use except for an occasional problem with breakage of the optic fiber as a result of patient movement or nursing maneuvers, which has been easily corrected by replacement of the probe. As nursing personnel and ancillary services have become familiar with this new monitor, breakage has not been a problem. This new device can be placed into the ventricular system, the brain parenchyma, or the subdural space, and appears to offer substantial advantages over other monitors presently in use.\r"

The respective survival rates after 8 years were 14% versus 17%; thus, there was little effect on long-term survival. Irradiation appears not to be of benefit after \"total\" removal. Patients with partly resected lesions appeared to benefit from postoperative radiotherapy; the median survival period after subtotal tumor resection was 37 months with and 26 months without radiotherapy (p = 0.0089). The findings also indicate that irradiation doses between 40 and 50 Gy were as effective as doses between 50 and 60 Gy in increasing the patients' probability of surviving 5 years after subtotal tumor resection. Since the risk of radiation necrosis is proportional to the dose applied, the lower dose is recommended. These conclusions were also valid when adjustments were made for prognostically significant histological and clinical features.\r"

  ".W": "The components of vasogenic edema associated with brain tumors were investigated in human biopsy material sampled from tumor and peritumoral tissue during neurosurgical operations. Tissue from 60 patients with glioblastomas, gliomas, meningiomas, and metastases who had been treated with dexamethasone prior to surgery was used for measurement of water, electrolyte, hemoglobin, serum protein, and dexamethasone concentrations. In all samples except metastases, positive correlations were obtained between water content and both serum protein levels and sodium content in tumors and peritumoral edema, suggesting that these components simultaneously determine forces for extravasation of plasma-derived edema fluid. However, the mean serum protein content varied considerably, being high in glioblastomas (16 mg/ml) and low in peritumoral edema surrounding metastases (4 mg/ml). The mean cerebral blood volume in all samples, as calculated from the tissue hemoglobin content, was 2.5 ml/100 gm wet weight in tumor tissue and 1.6 to 2.0 ml/100 gm wet weight in peritumoral tissue. Sodium concentrations were not significantly different among the tumor types. Both water and serum protein content decreased with increasing dexamethasone concentrations in glioblastomas, while this effect was virtually absent in gliomas and meningiomas. A therapeutic threshold of dexamethasone at 500 mg/gm wet weight was obtained for tumoral and peritumoral tissue of glioblastomas and was effective in a dose-dependent manner as long as the water content and the serum protein concentration remained below 6 ml/gm dry weight and 30 mg/gm dry weight, respectively. These results suggest a previously unknown selectivity among tumor types for the reduction of both water content and serum proteins in corticosteroid-treated edematous tissue.\r"

  ".W": "The behavior of bridging veins at their entrance into the superior sagittal sinus during elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) was investigated in rats using a cranial window and infusion of mock cerebrospinal fluid. The bridging veins became slightly smaller as the ICP rose (maximum reduction 17%). Compression or collapse of the veins was not observed, even at an ICP level of 100 mm Hg, and there was no cuffing of bridging veins upstream of the entrance. Both the scanning electron microscopic investigation based on resin vessel casts and the histological examination of whole-head coronal sections indicated that the narrowest points of the bridging veins are at their entrance to the superior sagittal sinus, caused by the oval aperture with thickened wall structure in the lateral sinus wall to which the bridging veins are connected. The present data thus support the concept that cerebral blood flow during intracranial hypertension is not reduced by venous cuffing or compression of the lateral lacunae and bridging veins; by contrast, the arteriovenous pressure difference seems to remain the determining factor even at high ICP. Thus, blood flow through the brain stops when ICP approaches the level of blood pressure.\r"

These nerve fibers apparently arise from motor cells of the ventral horn nuclei and join spinal nerve roots caudal to their level of origin. In all observed spinal cords, many of these axons converged at the cord surface and formed an irregular group of ectopic rootlets that could be visually traced to join conventional spinal nerve roots at one to several segments inferior to their original segmental level; occasional rootlets joined a dorsal nerve root. As almost all previous reports of nerve root interconnections involved only the dorsal roots and have been cited to explain a lack of an absolute segmental sensory nerve distribution, it is believed that these intersegmental motor fibers may similarly explain a more diffuse efferent distribution than has previously been suspected.\r"

Pups were anesthetized, tracheotomized, paralyzed, artificially ventilated, and randomly assigned to two groups: asphyxial insult produced by discontinuing ventilatory support, and no insult. Experiments for carbon-14-iodoantipyrine autoradiographic determination of rCBF and regional cerebral PG determination were performed on separate groups of pups. These studies demonstrated a significant increase in cortical gray PGE2 levels at a time when rCBF was significantly impaired in response to severe asphyxial insult. No such increase was noted in the periventricular white matter zones.\r"

The etiology of this phenomenon was investigated by creating arteriotomies of different lengths and orientation in the rat carotid artery and sealing them with the milliwatt CO2 laser. It was found that increasing the arteriotomy length from 0.5 to 1.0 mm significantly raised aneurysm occurrence (4/17 vs. 25/28, chi-square: p less than 0.001) regardless of orientation. Systemic hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 170 mm Hg) also significantly affected the aneurysm rate among the 0.5-mm arteriotomy group, raising aneurysm occurrence from 23.5% (4/17) to 100% (14/14) (p less than 0.001). Assuming that the stay-sutures used for LAVA's act as rigid supports, the rate of aneurysm occurrence must be related to the distance between sutures. This phenomenon has been exploited to create a reliable aneurysm model.\r"

This has previously been applied to the qualitative assessment of regional ventilation using krypton-81m, but may potentially be used for the calculation of regional alveolar ventilation per unit alveolar gas volume--(VA/VA)cal--from measurements of the alveolar concentration of the tracer. The steady-state alveolar tracer concentration was calculated for the course of a breathing cycle, using a lung model featuring airways dead space and tidal gas flow. The calculations were made by computer simulations of a lung, characterized by predefined values of parameters describing the lung structure and the mode of ventilation. In the normal lung of supine man at rest (specific alveolar ventilation, ranging from 1.0 to 3.5 min-1) the errors of (VA/VA)cal relative to the predefined true values range from an overestimation by some 3% in the low ventilation regions to an underestimation by 8% in the best ventilated regions. The errors mainly result from ventilation of the airways dead space, which will influence the distribution of tracer in the lung by the transfer of tracer between regions by way of the common dead space and by the decay of tracer during its transport through the bronchial tree.\r"

Because initial studies have been promising, the terminal glycine on the MAG3 compound has been varied to create a new series of N3S compounds. Twelve new N3S complexes were initially screened in mice and the more promising complexes, 99mTc mercaptoacetylgylcylglycyl-glycine [( 99mTc]MAG3), 99mTc mercaptoacetylgylcylglycyl-L-alanine [( 99mTc]MAG2-Ala), and both complexes of 99mTc mercaptoeacetylglycylglycyl-L-asparagine [( 99mTc]MAG2-Asn) and 99mTc mercaptoacetylglycylglycyl-L-glutamine [( 99mTc]MAG2-Gln), were further evaluated in rats utilizing constant infusion blood clearances, extraction efficiencies and protein binding assays.

The radioisotope infusions were repeated together with 100 mg of sodium perchlorate. There was a rapid transfer of 99mTc and 123I into milk, reaching a peak concentration 30 min after a 15-min infusion. The fractional secretion of 99mTc and 123I in milk was reduced by 70%-80% and 60%-66%, respectively, by perchlorate. The fractional secretion of 36Cl was not affected by perchlorate, and the shape of the 36Cl secretion curve differed from those of 99mTc and 123I, which were similar. It is probable, therefore, that the latter nuclides were secreted by a transport route different from that of chloride. Available data describing the secretion of 99mTc in human milk after pertechnetate administration was reviewed, and it was concluded that perchlorate pretreatment significantly reduced the secretion of 99mTc in human breast milk.\r"

Fifteen normal weight male subjects aged 20-53 yr (mean 30 yr) and 15 normal weight female subjects aged 20-45 yr (mean 32 yr) were studied. Each subject ingested an identical 300-g meal consisting of 150 g of beef stew and 150 g of orange juice. Technetium-99m-(99mTc) labeled liver pate was used as the radioactive marker for the solid phase; indium-111 DTPA [( 111In]DTPA) was the liquid marker. A scintillation camera and computer was used to measure the rate of emptying of the solid and liquid phases. Correction for radionuclide depth, decay, and crosstalk was performed. The half-emptying time for men was: solids 59.8 +/- 3.7 min, liquids 30.3 +/- 2.3 min, and for women was: solids 92.4 +/- 7.5 min, liquids 53.8 +/- 4.9 min. These differences were statistically significant (solids, p = 0.00097; liquids, p = 0.00038). We conclude that women empty both solids and liquids from their stomachs more slowly than men. Possible mechanisms for the difference in gastric emptying rates between men and women are discussed.\r"

Increased thyroid uptake by the newborn requires that higher cumulated activities be incorporated into the dose determinations for the newborn.\r"

Whole plasma triacylglycerol, cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations were appreciably lower in group C than in group A, mainly due to a fall in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and subgroup 2 of high density lipoprotein (HDL2), with less consistent changes in LDL and HDL3. VLDL components of group B were also considerably lower than corresponding ones in group A. LPL and HL activities were about 50% lower in groups B and C than in group A. Increased hepatic triacylglycerol and cholesterol concentrations were observed in groups B and C. It is suggested that the decrease in LPL and HL activity of fish oil-fed rats may be an adaptive response to the low concentration of the substrate (triacylglycerols) for these enzymes.\r"

Pancreas weights of rats fed diets supplemented with sulfur amino acids were higher than those of rats fed unsupplemented diets. In some instances this increase resulting from nutritional improvement of the diet was relatively greater than that in total body weight. Explanations are offered for these effects in terms of the proposed biofeedback mechanism involving the gastrointestinal endocrine system and the hormone cholecystokinin. The observed stimulation of pancreatic growth by added sulfur amino acids may be closely associated with this pancreatic regulatory mechanism when activated in response to dietary trypsin inhibitors present in unheated soy protein. The extent to which pancreatic hypertrophy develops as a result of a given exposure to trypsin inhibitors may be limited when the total amount or quality of the protein in the diet is less than optimal.\r"

During postweaning offspring received the maternal diets fed during lactation. Neocortices of offspring were examined at 30 d of age by liquid chromatography and light microscopy. Vitamin restriction during gestation and 30 d postnatal was the only vitamin B-6-restricted treatment of the three administered that altered B-6 vitamer levels in neocortex; all vitamers were depressed equally. Brain weight and volume of neocortex were not changed significantly by the maternal restrictions imposed. However, each restriction adversely affected neurogenesis and neuron longevity of the neocortex and when expressed as percent reduction from control, neuron longevity was affected more severely than neurogenesis.\r"

Gain and feed efficiency of chicks fed excess Mg, as MgO but not as MgSO4 X 7H2O, were lower than in chicks fed the basal level of Mg. Coccidiosis X Mg interactions were observed in bone Mg and bone Ca concentration data; bone Mg uptake was greater when high dietary Mg and the coccidial infection were in combination.

  ".W": "To determine if zinc homeostasis occurs by zinc output from bile-pancreatic secretions, the bile-pancreatic duct and intestine of rats were surgically cannulated, and bile-pancreatic fluid was collected 2 h/d from the day of surgery to 8 d after surgery. The rats were fed diets containing 10, 100 or 1000 micrograms Zn/g diet before and after surgery. The effect of surgery itself was significant; food intake was initially lower than presurgery levels, but returned to presurgery levels by d 5. Protein and zinc concentrations, and carboxypeptidase A (CpA) and carboxypeptidase B (CpB) activities in bile-pancreatic fluid increased after surgery and leveled off at approximately d 6. Among the dietary zinc groups, the concentration of zinc in bile-pancreatic fluid varied significantly, whereas concentrations of calcium and copper did not. Zinc concentration in bile-pancreatic fluid for d 1-8 postsurgery averaged 1.8, 3.2 and 4.4 micrograms Zn/g, in the groups fed 10, 100 and 1000 micrograms Zn/g diet, respectively. Because the percent of zinc ingested that was secreted in bile-pancreatic fluid, estimated to be 57, 9.5 and 1.2% for the groups consuming the diets containing 10, 100 and 1000 micrograms Zn/g diet respectively, was not similar in the three groups, the quantity of zinc in bile-pancreatic fluid is not proportionally related to the amount of zinc ingested. Our results therefore suggest that zinc secretion in bile-pancreatic fluid does not play a major role in zinc homeostasis. Molecular localization of zinc in bile-pancreatic fluid and measurement of activity of CpA and CpB indicated that zinc in bile-pancreatic fluid is associated primarily with these digestive enzymes.\r"

Modern techniques for computer simulation and numerical analysis now make it possible to study the kinetics of iron absorption in vivo. We used a physiologically based mathematical model of iron metabolism to analyze tracer iron kinetics in normal and iron-deficient beagles. The model provides characteristic information about both intestinal and systemic iron exchange, thus permitting formulation of an hypothesis that may explain the regulation of iron absorption under these conditions. The results indicate that control of iron absorption is a function of independent expression of iron requirements by each tissue, including the intestinal mucosa. This hypothesis is consistent with other in vivo and in vitro observations in iron deficiency and may have implications for understanding the mechanism of the altered iron absorption in other disorders of iron metabolism.\r"

Beginning at parturition, dams were fed a diet low in copper (0.5 mg/kg) and the offspring were weaned to this diet. Half the dams and their respective offspring received supplemental copper (20 mg/L) in the drinking water (+Cu) and served as controls. Unsupplemented offspring (-Cu) had lower activity of cuproenzymes serum ceruloplasmin, spleen and thymus cytochrome-c oxidase and copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase. The -Cu mice exhibited anemia, splenomegaly and thymic atrophy. Based on the marker enzyme alkaline phosphodiesterase I (APDE-I), lymphocyte plasma membranes were enriched 7- to 10-fold for spleen and thymus, respectively, after discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation. The activity of APDE-I was higher in spleen and thymus samples from -Cu mice than from those of +Cu mice for both crude homogenates and purified plasma membranes. Proteins were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining. A yellow-appearing band, Mr 74,000, present in all splenic membrane samples from +Cu mice was not evident in the samples from -Cu mice. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were quantified by gas chromatography. Compared to splenic membranes from +Cu mice, the samples from -Cu mice demonstrated significant changes in all FAME (lower 16:0, 18:0 and 20:3n-6 and higher 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6 and 20:4n-6), including a higher unsaturation index.

Because changes in steroidogenesis are mediated through alterations in adenylate cyclase activity (ACL), the effect of varied AsA plasma concentrations on guinea pig adrenal ACL activity and plasma cortisol was studied. Forty-two male guinea pigs were randomly allocated to the following seven groups: controls, scorbutic, and groups given 0.1, 5, 10, 20 or 100 mg ascorbic acid/100 g body weight, respectively. Scorbutic animals had very low levels of AsA in comparison to control animals. Plasma AsA levels increased as AsA dose increased. The levels of AsA in the group given 0.1 mg AsA were higher than in controls. Basal adenylate cyclase activity did not vary significantly among animal groups. In contrast, values for NaF-stimulated ACL activity showed a progressive decrease with increasing AsA doses. A highly significant correlation was found between decreasing ACL activity and increasing plasma AsA concentrations. On the other hand, NaF-responsive ACL activity was higher in scorbutic animals than in any other group. Higher mean cortisol values were found in the scorbutic group than in the controls, correlating with high levels of NAF-stimulated ACL activity. Higher mean cortisol values were also found in the group given 0.1 mg AsA although ACL activity in this group was not affected. This finding, coupled with reduced ACL activity in these groups, is consistent with the inhibitory effect of a megadose of AsA on production of cortisol from the adrenal. The above data may suggest that differing plasma concentrations of AsA regulate in vivo steroidogenesis by altering the activity of the membrane-bound enzyme adenylate cyclase.\r"

Responses of adrenalectomized ob/ob mice fed the purified high glucose diet from 4 to 7 wk of age mimicked those of mice fed the purified high fat diet, not those of mice fed the high carbohydrate nonpurified diet. Plasma glucose responses to a glucose load in adrenalectomized ob/ob mice paralleled the diet-dependent changes in energy balance. These results demonstrate that diet composition interacts with adrenal secretions to influence energy and glucose metabolism in ob/ob mice; consumption of either a purified high glucose or high fat diet negates the beneficial effects of adrenalectomy on energy and glucose metabolism observed when adrenalectomized ob/ob mice consume a nonpurified diet.\r"

KC rats consumed more energy (+70-100%) and retained energy with a much higher efficiency than control rats. Adrenalectomy of KC rats 1 wk (before gross obesity was evident) or 5 wk (when KC rats were 70% overweight) after KC surgery caused a reduction in energy intake to levels approximating those of control rats. Furthermore, energy retention in adrenalectomized KC rats was depressed more than could be explained on the basis of the reduction in energy intake. Two factors associated with the reduction in energy retention, urinary excretion of norepinephrine, an indicator of sympathetic nervous system activity, and GDP binding to brown adipose tissue mitochondria, an indicator of the thermogenic capacity of the tissue, were higher in vadrenalectomized KC rats than in pair-fed KC rats. Removal of the adrenals not only suppressed hyperphagia in KC rats fed a high fat diet, but also increased energy expenditure per kilocalorie consumed.\r"

  ".W": "When the energy intake of (NZB X NZW)F1 female mice was reduced to 60% of the intake of simultaneously ad libitum-fed mice, the early death associated with autoimmune-based renal disease in this strain was greatly delayed. The length of prolongation of disease-free life depended not only on the decreased energy intake but also on the energy source. In the group of mice with 60% intake of a carbohydrate-free (i.e., high fat) diet, mean longevity was doubled as compared to that of ad libitum-fed mice. However, when the nonprotein energy was supplied by carbohydrate (sucrose and glycerol) the mean longevity was three times that of the ad libitum-fed groups, although survival times varied widely. With ad libitum feeding the nonprotein energy source did not significantly affect longevity. Clearly, although energy intake restriction provides significant influence on longevity, very high fat diets do not give the same protection as do high carbohydrate diets. The basis for this difference is not entirely clear and several explanations are possible.\r"

  ".W": "Energy restriction increases longevity and life span of B/W mice as it does in mice of other long-lived or short-lived strains. Mice of autoimmune-prone strains that develop certain diseases of aging experience an increase in median longevity when energy intake is restricted early in life. The present experiments analyze the influence of restricting energy intake while feeding constant, adequate and greatly excessive amounts of protein, and constant amounts of minerals and vitamins. The experiments assess the influence of excess protein intake in mice fed ad libitum versus those restricted in energy intake. Ad libitum feeding of diets with protein composition ranging from 15 to 50% did not alter longevity or onset and manifestations of renal disease in B/W mice. In mice consuming a restricted energy intake of a diet providing identical amounts of protein to those consumed by ad libitum-fed mice, whether the protein intake was very high or normal, longevity was equally greatly prolonged. Ad libitum feeding of diets of greatly differing protein content is well tolerated by B/W mice. Both the 15 and 50% protein diets, when ad libitum fed, permitted expression of autoimmune disease and glomerulonephritis in B/W mice but did not adversely influence development or progression of disease. Restriction of energy intake of either the normal protein diet or the high protein diet greatly prolonged the life of mice of the autoimmune-prone, glomerulonephritis-prone B/W strain.\r"

Each of the control and the protein-deficient groups was further divided into three subgroups according to the level of energy intake. Liver DNA, RNA and total cellular protein concentrations and serum albumin and albumin mRNA concentrations were determined. Protein deficiency caused a marked inhibition of liver growth but the size of most cells remained normal. The low protein diet caused concurrent decreases in the levels of serum albumin and serum mRNA. However, this effect was observed only with the combination of a low protein diet and normal energy intake. The low protein-low energy diet failed to induce the low serum albumin level. Our findings suggest that the altered balance between at least two factors of protein and energy intake serves as a trigger for several metabolic changes which ultimately regulate specific genes.\r"

Forty-eight adult female hamsters were randomly allotted to eight groups of six each for a 40-d experiment. Exercise was in the form of voluntary wheel-running. Four groups served as either exercise or sedentary controls and were fed either a low or a high fat diet for 40 d, in a factorial fashion. Another four groups had access to exercise for 32 d and were then retired for 8 d. Of these four groups, two were fed either the low or high fat diet for the entire 40-d period; the other two were changed to the other diet on d 32. Results showed that compared to sedentary hamsters, exercise hamsters had greater body weight gain but less body fat content and hepatic lipogenic enzyme activities. Under both sedentary and exercise conditions, high fat-fed hamsters had lower hepatic lipogenic enzyme activities and less body fat content than low fat-fed hamsters. Upon retirement, high fat feeding led to a faster increase in body fat especially in previously high fat-fed hamsters. Results of this study suggest that dietary fat intake can significantly modulate the exercise and retirement effects with respect to body weight gain and body fat content.\r"

On one day, they were fed a low sodium lunch (130 mg), and on the other, the same lunch with a high sodium content (2175 mg). Milk samples were collected before each lunch and breasts were emptied with an electric pump. After lunch, samples were collected from each breast every 15 min for 2 h. No significant postprandial variation was found in mean sodium or potassium concentrations, nor were significant differences found in sodium or potassium values after the high sodium or the low sodium lunch. We conclude that there is no significant influence of maternal sodium intake on postprandial milk sodium or potassium concentrations.\r"

Umbilical VO2 in conscious, single-pregnant ewes and fetal wet and dry body weights were measured at 73-97 d (n = 14) and at 119-141 d (n = 28) of gestation. Fetal wet and dry organ weights were related to body weights in an additional seven single-pregnant and eight twin-pregnant ewes at 73-140 d. Fetal VO2/kg wet weight decreased by 25% between mid and late gestation, whereas VO2/kg dry weight decreased by 56% and was paralleled by a similar decline in the relative aggregate weight of the vital organs (liver, kidneys, heart, brain). Log-log regression of VO2 on dry body weight, and of dry vital organ weight on dry body weight yielded coefficients of 0.73 +/- 0.02 and 0.66 +/- 0.01, respectively, suggesting that a decline in the relative growth of metabolically active organs explains much of the decline in weight-specific VO2 during fetal development.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of intravenously administered amino acids and of varying amounts of energy on metabolic rate were studied and potential mechanisms examined in 19 healthy 4- to 6-day-old preterm (30 to 32 weeks gestation) infants. The infants were randomized to three groups. Group 1 (n = 6) received nonprotein energy 38 kcal/kg/d; group 2 (n = 5), 64 kcal/kg/d; and group 3 (n = 8), 64 kcal/kg/d plus 1 to 2 g/kg/d crystalline amino acids. Thirty-six hours after beginning the infusion, oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured by indirect calorimetry for 5 to 6 hours. Simultaneously, urine was collected for urinary norepinephrine excretion, which was determined using liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Group 1 had lower VO2 and urinary norepinephrine excretion than did groups 2 and 3, which did not differ. T4 and T3 were not different among the three groups. The demonstrated simultaneous changes in VO2 and norepinephrine excretion with varying energy intakes independent of age supports energy intake as a modulator of the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn controls metabolic rate. Moderate amounts of intravenously administered amino acids do not appear to play an active role in this process; nor do they alter T3 and T4 valves. When VO2 increased with increasing energy intake, T3 and T4 were unaffected, supporting a passive role for thyroid hormones in diet-induced thermogenesis.\r"

The validity of the method was confirmed by collecting matched plasma and saliva samples from another group of 36 neonates. The correlation between plasma and saliva cortisol was r = 0.83. We suggest that salivary cortisol is a useful, noninvasive method of studying adrenocortical status in the newborn infant.\r"

The purpose of our investigation was to confirm these results using a new technique for calcitonin measurement and to study the effect on bone turnover. Calcitonin serum levels were measured with two different antibodies before and after a low-dose Ca infusion in patients receiving phenytoin, primidone, carbamazepine, or valproate and in patients with congenital hypothyroidism receiving L-thyroxine. In comparison with control values, basal and Ca-stimulated extractable calcitonin, representing the monomeric and biologically active form of the hormone, were moderately decreased in patients with epilepsy receiving phenytoin and primidone, and severely decreased in patients with hypothyroidism. Ca and bone metabolism were normal, except for an elevated renal threshold for phosphate (indicating phosphate conservation) in patients receiving phenytoin and primidone, and increased fasting urinary excretion of Ca and hydroxyproline (indicating increased bone resorption) in patients with hypothyroidism. The secretory capacity of the C cells for monomeric calcitonin is decreased in children receiving treatment with some, but not all, anticonvulsant drugs, and lacking in patients with hypothyroidism. Patients with calcitonin deficiency may be prone to osteopenia if the tendency to increased osteoclastic activity is aggravated by secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with epilepsy receiving phenytoin and primidone or by inappropriate thyroid replacement therapy in patients with hypothyroidism.\r"

Placentas obtained at cesarean section were perfused for 2 hr from both maternal and fetal sides in constant flow recycling systems. Cimetidine was administered as a bolus dose to either the maternal circuit alone (n = 4) or to both maternal and fetal circuits simultaneously (n = 3), to achieve initial concentrations of 4 micrograms/ml. Antipyrine (20 micrograms/ml) and l-leucine (0.25 mM) were administered in like fashion as reference compounds. Two hours after maternal dosage there was equilibration of antipyrine across the placenta, but equilibration of cimetidine was incomplete (fetal/maternal ratio = 0.46 +/- 0.07). The fetal/maternal ratio of l-leucine was greater than unity; consistent with active maternal to fetal transport. Maternal to fetal cimetidine transplacental clearance (0.50 +/- 0.05 ml/min) was 23% of antipyrine clearance. After simultaneous dosage to both maternal and fetal circuits, the l-leucine fetal/maternal ratio was 1.37 +/- 0.08 at 2 hr and maternal and fetal levels of cimetidine and antipyrine were at equilibrium for the duration of the experiment (fetal/maternal ratio of cimetidine = 1.01 +/- 0.02). This study shows that cimetidine is transferred across the human placenta by passive diffusion. In contrast to the rapid placental transfer demonstrated by the majority of drugs studied previously, the placental transfer of cimetidine is slow. We conclude that the human placenta may therefore provide significant protection of the fetus from a single maternally administered dose of cimetidine.\r"

  ".W": "Effect of sulfhydryl reagents on the transport of tetraethylammonium, an organic cation, has been studied in brush border membrane vesicles isolated from rat renal cortex. H+ gradient-dependent uptake of tetraethylammonium by the vesicles was inhibited by various sulfhydryl reagents in a dose-dependent manner, and the potency of the reagents was followed in the order of HgCl2 greater than p-chloromercuribenzoate, p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (PCMBS) greater than N-ethylmaleimide. In the absence of H+ gradient, tetraethylammonium uptake and efflux also were inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate and PCMBS. The sulfhydryl reagents did not affect the dissipation rate of H+ gradient across the membranes. Pretreatment of brush border membranes with PCMBS resulted in an inhibition of tetraethylammonium uptake in the presence and absence of H+ gradient, and this inhibition was reversed by subsequent treatment of the vesicles with thiols such as dithiothreitol, glutathione and cysteine. The inhibitory effect by PCMBS pretreatment was protected in the preincubation with unlabeled tetraethylammonium. These results suggest that sulfhydryl reagents inhibit the transport of tetraethylammonium by their specific interaction with the active sites of the carrier, and that sulfhydryl groups are essential for organic cation transport system in renal brush border membranes.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of bunazosin on the norepinephrine-induced electrical and mechanical activities of smooth muscles of the rabbit proximal urethra were investigated using microelectrode and tension recording methods. Responses to norepinephrine were mediated by activation of both alpha-1 and beta adrenoceptors. In the presence of propranolol, the norepinephrine-induced contraction increased and, with yohimbine, the phasic but not tonic contraction was only inhibited slightly. Contributions of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor to the norepinephrine-induced contraction were negligible. Bunazosin inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner both the phasic and tonic responses of the norepinephrine-induced contraction, and the concentration-response relationship for norepinephrine shifted to the right. The Schild plot obtained from measurements of tonic responses in this antagonism yielded a straight line with a slope of 0.96. The pA2 value for bunazosin was 8.39 and the KB value was 4.1 nM. Prazosin had similar effects (the corresponding values being 0.96, 8.21 and 6.2 nM, respectively). The mechanical response evoked by field stimulation was composed of cholinergic, noradrenergic alpha-1 and noncholinergic-nonadrenergic contractions and of a subsequent nonadrenergic-noncholinergic relaxation. Bunazosin inhibited the twitch contraction evoked by field stimulation more than did prazosin, albeit not completely. These results indicate that although the smooth muscle tone in the urethra is regulated by multiple neural factors, the elevation of the tone is regulated predominantly by activation of the alpha-1 adrenoceptors. Bunazosin has an antagonistic action on this receptor. The actions of bunazosin are discussed in relation to the clinical application in cases of inadequate micturition.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of acute and chronic Li treatment to influence agonist and depolarization-induced phosphoinositide metabolism was examined in rat cerebral cortex slices. After acute treatment (6.75 mEq/kg, 18 hr), [3H]inositol phosphates accumulating in the presence of 100 microM carbachol (muscarinic), 31 mM K+, 300 microM histamine (H1) and 300 microM 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-hydroxytryptamine2) were reduced significantly even after preincubation of slices with 2.5 mM myo-inositol. However, the response to noradrenaline (100 microM) (alpha-1) was unaffected. In the absence of a drug-free period, chronic Li (2 weeks) maintained the reduced phosphoinositide response to receptor agonists and K+, and now even noradrenaline responses were reduced significantly. Dose-response curves revealed that reduction in the response to carbachol was due to a fall in maximal response and not in EC50. When rats were withdrawn from chronic treatment for 18 hr, the responses to carbachol were enhanced significantly with respect to untreated controls. Neither acute nor chronic Li treatments altered significantly the overall incorporation of [3H]inositol into phospholipids. Furthermore, Li treatment did not influence the activity of phospholipase C assayed in crude homogenates of cerebral cortex. In conclusion, acute and chronic Li treatments producing less than [1 mM] in cerebral tissue, severely disrupts phosphoinositide metabolism. Although such effects may well be secondary to inhibition of inositol-monophosphatase, they are not reversed by inositol and therefore do not appear to result from depleted phosphoinositides.\r"

The i.a. administration of HA1077 produced significant increases in vertebral blood flow in dogs. The effects of HA1077 on the vascular responses were studied in vitro. Spiral strips of rabbit aorta were mounted for isometric tension recording in physiological salt solution. HA1077 produced a competitive inhibition of the Ca++-induced contraction of the depolarized rabbit aorta. The pA2 of HA1077 for the Ca@-induced contraction was 6.71. The inhibitory effect of HA1077 on the KCl-induced contraction was not altered by atropine, propranolol, theophylline or indomethacin. HA1077 (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) inhibited contractile responses to KCl, phenylephrine (PHE) and prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha similarly, whereas verapamil, diltiazem and nicardipine were much less effective in blocking the contractions induced by PHE or PG. Even in Ca++-free physiological salt solution, both PHE and PG were capable of contracting the aorta. These Ca++-free contractile responses to PHE and PG were antagonized effectively by HA1077. Verapamil failed to inhibit these contractions. We also investigated the effects of HA1077 on guinea pig heart contractility. In contrast to calcium entry blockers (which are known to have a direct negative inotropic effect), HA1077 did not change the developed tension in the left atrium at concentrations up to 3 X 10(-4) M. The present evidence demonstrates that the novel antivasospasm drug HA1077 is a class of calcium antagonists different from the calcium entry blockers.\r"

The pD2 values (right atria, 7.30; left atria, 7.18) were midway between its known affinities at beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors and are evidence that positive inotropic and chronotropic responses involve a minor beta-2 adrenoceptor component. The pKB values for procaterol against (-)-isoproterenol in the right atria (5.59) and left atria (5.29) were consistent with its affinity for beta-1 adrenoceptors and suggest that these are responsible primarily for positive inotropic and chronotropic responses. Receptor binding studies in right atrial homogenates showed that [125I]cyanopindolol binding was saturable (KD = 36.2 pM, maximal density of binding sites = 49.2 fmol mg-1 protein) and stereoselective with respect to the isomers of propranolol. Competition binding curves for the beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A and beta-2 selective antagonist ICI 118,551 against [125I]cyanopindolol binding were resolved into two components using iterative curve fitting techniques. Binding sites with the characteristics of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors were present in the proportions of approximately 75 to 25%. These studies indicate either that the beta-1 adrenoceptor is coupled more efficiently to the positive inotropic and chronotropic response than the beta-2 adrenoceptor or that a proportion of the beta-2 adrenoceptors subserve other functions.\r"

Development of nuclear emulsion-coated coverslips confirmed these observations and, in addition, localized beta-2 adrenoceptors to nerve tissue and the aortic valve. In the papillary muscle and surrounding Purkinje cells there was a high density and even distribution of beta-1 and a much lower density of beta-2 adrenoceptors.

A conditioning clamp pulse was applied from -90 to 0 mV through the single sucrose gap voltage clamp, and the maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) of action potential elicited after the clamp pulse was measured as an index of sodium channel availability. In the presence of aprindine (2 and 5 microM) or lidocaine (20 and 40 microM), Vmax of test action potential 100 msec after the clamp pulse was decreased progressively as the clamp pulse duration was prolonged. The time constant of this inactivated channel block by aprindine was much slower than by lidocaine. Vmax after a 1000 msec clamp pulse recovered exponentially with a time constant of 4.75 to 4.81 sec for aprindine and 254 to 260 msec for lidocaine. In the presence of both aprindine and lidocaine, Vmax recovered in dual exponential function, where the short and the long time constant corresponded to the values for single treatment with each drug. In preparations treated with aprindine alone the use-dependent decrease of Vmax was observed during stimulation trains at rates higher than 0.1 Hz. This use-dependent block was attenuated significantly after additional application of lidocaine resulted in a net increase in Vmax at 0.5 to 1.0 Hz. These findings suggest that aprindine and lidocaine may block the sodium channels by binding to a common receptor site with different kinetics, leading to a competitive displacement with each other at their high concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Previous autoradiographic studies which have localized alpha-2 adrenoceptors within brain have used tritiated derivatives of clonidine and other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists. In the present study we have compared the autoradiographic distributions of binding sites labeled by two reportedly selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists, [3H]rauwolscine and [3H]idazoxan, in rat brain. The distribution of high affinity [3H]idazoxan binding sites differed markedly from that of high affinity [3H]rauwolscine sites throughout the neuraxis. The distribution of [3H]idazoxan binding sites paralleled closely that of [3H]clonidine sites, and corresponded to areas of noradrenergic innervation. Densest [3H]idazoxan labeling appeared over anterior olfactory nuclei, fundus striatum, septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, central gray, inferior colliculus, dorsal parabrachial nucleus, locus ceruleus and nucleus of the solitary tract. In contrast, much lower levels of [3H]rauwolscine labeling appeared over several areas which receive primarily dopaminergic innervation, and thus corresponded closely to [3H]spiroperidol binding distributions. Densest [3H]rauwolscine labeling appeared over nucleus caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, Islands of Calleja, hippocampus, parasubiculum, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus and substantia nigra. In areas labeled by [3H]rauwolscine, computerized densitometric analysis of autoradiographic saturation curves revealed that the maximum binding values for [3H]idazoxan high affinity binding sites were consistently greater than those for high affinity [3H]rauwolscine sites. The pharmacological characterization of these two binding sites in the accompanying paper supports the present anatomical evidence that [3H]idazoxan labels a heterogenous population of alpha-2 adrenoceptor sites, one population of which is selectively labeled by [3H]rauwolscine.\r"

Although [3H]idazoxan labeling appears over brain regions receiving noradrenergic innervation, [3H]rauwolscine binding sites are localized most densely in several areas corresponding to dopaminergic terminal fields. We have presently characterized the pharmacological binding properties of high affinity [3H]rauwolscine and [3H]idazoxan labeled sites, using tissue preparation and incubation protocols which are identical to those used in the previous autoradiographic study. Endogenous monoamines inhibited radioligand binding with a rank order of potency of epinephrine = norepinephrine greater than dopamine greater than serotonin. Numerous dopaminergic compounds failed to inhibit either [3H]rauwolscine or [3H]idazoxan binding with high potency, and rauwolscine was a poor inhibitor of [3H]spiroperidol binding. Several adrenergic compounds which selectively label alpha-1 or beta adrenoceptors also exhibited low potency in inhibiting either radioligand. In contrast, alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists possessed high affinity for both [3H]rauwolscine and [3H]idazoxan labeled sites. Their relative potencies at the two sites differed, however. Whereas idazoxan was equipotent in inhibiting either [3H]rauwolscine or [3H]idazoxan binding, rauwolscine exhibited 10-fold higher affinity for its own labeled site. These pharmacological data are consistent with anatomical data presented in the preceding paper, which support the existence of a heterogenous population of alpha-2 adrenoceptors within rat brain, labeled entirely by [3H]idazoxan and only in part by [3H]rauwolscine.\r"

Their action was based on their specific inhibitory effect on cytoplasmic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, one of the key enzymes in cholesterol biosynthesis. These compounds inhibited the enzyme in vitro and in vivo. The inhibition in vitro was in the order of n = 12 greater than n = 10 greater than n = 8 greater than n = 6 greater than, where n is the number of methylene groups inserted between the two thiosulfonate groups. In vivo, the compounds produced variable hypocholesterolemic and/or hypotriglyceridemic effects when injected into groups of newly weaned rats fed standard chow, high fat or high carbohydrate diets. When the enzyme activity was measured in isolated liver homogenates in vitro after injections of the drugs in vivo, 80% of original thiolase activity was lost. This inhibition of enzyme activity did not seem to be rate limiting for their hypolipidemic action in vivo as these effects did not correlate with the inhibition of the isolated enzyme. The lack of correlation between in vitro and in vivo activity might be due to the compounds affecting other enzyme systems and/or due to their differential disposition in vivo.\r"

Tolbutamide hydroxylase activity copurified with P-450MP; electrophoretically homogenous P-450MP catalyzed both tolbutamide and S-mephenytoin hydroxylation. Each substrate competitively inhibited hydroxylation of the other, and anti-P-450MP inhibited tolbutamide hydroxylation in human liver microsomes. Significant correlation between tolbutamide and S-mephenytoin hydroxylase activities was seen in a set of human liver samples. These findings suggested that subjects with a genetically determined impairment in ability to hydroxylate mephenytoin might also have deficient tolbutamide metabolism. However, plasma tolbutamide concentration-time profiles and urinary excretion of metabolites formed via the hydroxylation pathway were similar in four phenotypically poor and six extensive metabolizers of mephenytoin. We suggest that alteration of a substrate binding site of P-450MP may reduce its ability to hydroxylate S-mephenytoin but not tolbutamide.\r"

Both electroshock and kindled seizures were studied. Two alpha-2 receptor antagonists, idazoxan and yohimbine, blocked the anticonvulsant action of intranigral muscimol in the electroshock model. Neither a beta nor an alpha-1 adrenergic nor a dopamine-2 receptor antagonist blocked this action. In contrast to electroshock seizures, an alpha-2 antagonist only partially reversed the anticonvulsant action of intranigral muscimol in the kindling model. We interpret the data to indicate that the interaction of norepinephrine with alpha-2 receptors is required for the anticonvulsant action of intranigral muscimol in the electroshock model. The only partial reversal found in the kindling model suggests that nigral control of seizure propagation involves more than alpha-2 receptor mediated neurotransmission.\r"

To study this, the reduction in the radioactive content in the brain of rats after administration of (-)-[125I]iodopindolol (IPIN) by systemically administered beta agonists or antagonists was measured. Previous studies show that after the i.v. administration of IPIN the binding in vivo to various areas of the central nervous system has the characteristics expected of binding to beta adrenergic receptors. Of the antagonists tested, pindolol and butylpindolol showed potent interactions with beta receptors in both cortex and cerebellum whereas atenolol and practolol did not interact at doses up to 30 mg/kg. CGP-12177 showed moderate potency in inhibiting IPIN binding in vivo. We have shown previously that propranolol and alprenolol inhibit IPIN binding with high potency in cortex and cerebellum. At high doses, butoxamine, a beta-2 antagonist, reduced the binding of IPIN in the cerebellum but not in the cortex. Of the agonists tested, clenbuterol and prenalterol caused a significant dose-dependent reduction of the binding of IPIN, with clenbuterol being more potent. Isoproterenol, salbutamol, salmefamol and dobutamine had no effect. With the exception of CGP-12177, the affinity of the drugs for central beta adrenergic receptors measured in vitro was correlated significantly with their ability to inhibit IPIN binding in vivo whereas their degree of lipophilicity was not correlated significantly with potency in vivo. The inhibition of IPIN binding in vivo from brain areas can be used to evaluate whether drugs penetrate into brain and interact with central beta adrenergic receptors.\r"

Unextracted medium from incubations of canine or human arteries with arachidonic acid and the calcium ionophore, A23187, contained a substance which exhibited a leukotriene (LT)-like smooth muscle contracting activity when tested on the superfused guinea pig lung parenchymal strip bioassay. This activity could be blocked by the LT antagonist, FPL-55712. Compounds present in these media were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified as LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 by liquid scintillation counting, bioassay and radioimmunoassay. In addition, coronary artery rings converted synthetic [3H]LTC4 to [3H]LTD4 with a half-life of 44 +/- 8 min. LTD4 metabolism to LTE4 was also demonstrated. The metabolism of [3H]LTC4 was abolished by incubation of the arterial rings with a gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase inhibitor, serineborate. Production of monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (5-, 12- and 15-HETE) which have been isolated previously from vascular tissue incubations was confirmed. Production of HETE was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid and unaffected by indomethacin. These findings indicate that coronary vessels can metabolize exogenous arachidonic acid by the lipoxygenase pathway. In addition to HETE, the vessels were shown to synthesize LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4, compounds which possess potent biological actions on the coronary circulation.\r"

Buspirone, gepirone and isapirone were found to possess weak alpha-1 adrenoceptor affinity (relative to prazosin) but significant and selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor intrinsic efficacy (relative to norepinephrine, phenylephrine and ST-587), which was expressed in a tissue- and species-dependent manner. The rank order for alpha-1 adrenoceptor affinity (isapirone greater than buspirone approximately equal to gepirone) was different from the rank order for alpha-1 adrenoceptor intrinsic efficacy (buspirone greater than gepirone greater than isapirone). The tissues that were the most responsive to norepinephrine and ST-587 (i.e., rat and rabbit aorta) were the same tissues in which the intrinsic efficacy of buspirone was expressed. In contrast, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine was inactive at alpha-1 adrenoceptors. Although no alpha-2 adrenoceptor intrinsic efficacy was observed for any of the compounds, isapirone and 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine displayed weak alpha-2 adrenoceptor affinity (relative to rauwolscine). Recent studies have shown buspirone to have an effect on central and peripheral monoaminergic mechanisms. The demonstration in the present study that buspirone and related compounds display significant alpha adrenoceptor activity suggests that alpha adrenoceptor involvement should be considered as a potential contributing factor in the central nervous system and/or peripheral activity of this class of compounds.\r"

  ".W": "Radioimmunoassays were developed for R- and S-pentobarbital. The optical isomers of pentobarbital were individually alkylated to N-crotonic acid analogs that were coupled to bovine serum albumin. Immunization of rabbits with the conjugates, which were enantiomerically pure at the asymmetric' carbon of the pentobarbital moiety, led to formation of antisera that selectively bound the predicted enantiomer. In displacement studies with enantiomerically pure radioligands, the opposite enantiomer showed 1.0 to 1.4% cross-reaction. Similar selective binding was observed for enantiomers of secobarbital, thiopental and thiamylal. Assays were developed and used to determine enantiomer pharmacokinetics in rabbits and humans given racemic pentobarbital. In rabbits, difference in clearance of the two isomers was minimal, the result of a slightly larger volume of distribution of the R-enantiomer combined with a slightly higher value of the elimination rate constant beta for the S-enantiomer. In humans, the volume of distribution was 12% greater for the R-enantiomer, but the value of beta was 14% higher for this isomer as well. Thus, the median clearance of the S-enantiomer (1.96 liters/h) was 25% less than that of the R-isomer (2.58 liters/h). The S-enantiomer was also more strongly protein bound in plasma (73.5% vs 63.4% for the R-enantiomer), which is consistent with its structural congruence to S-warfarin, S-phenprocoumon and S-glifumide.\r"

In voltage-clamped Myxicola axons DTX affected both the K+ and Na+ conductances. DTX blocked completely Myxicola K+ channels with a KD of 150 nM and induced slow K+ inactivation. DTX doubled the time constants for inactivation of conducting Na+ channels and gating charge immobilization without altering Na+ activation or the voltage- and time-dependent fast and slow Na+ inactivation induced by depolarizing prepulses. A selective effect on open Na+ channel inactivation provides additional evidence for kinetic models in which resting Na+ channels need not open before being inactivated.\r"

Aquaresis was evaluated in vivo; the most potent aquaretic agents were again those with D-tyrosine (alkyl) substitutions at position 2. Correlation of in vitro vasopressin antagonist and in vivo aquaretic potencies for a series of antagonists was r = 0.7880 (P less than .05). Renal excretion of electrolytes, creatinine and urea tended to increase slightly as a function of vasopressin antagonist dose; the rates of solute excretion approached but seldom exceeded those rates associated with water diuresis in squirrel monkeys. The vasopressin antagonists antagonized the antidiuretic activity of exogenous vasopressin in vivo. Onset of the aquaretic response to i.v. administration of desGlyd(CH2)5D-Tyr(Et)VAVP was within 30 min; duration was greater than 120 min.

BM 123A was a potent inhibitor of heart rate in spontaneously beating rabbit hearts. Perfusion of hearts with BM 123A for 30 min caused a lack of sensitivity of the heart to the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M and an 80% alkylation of muscarinic receptors as measured by the reduction in the binding capacity of N-[3H]methylscopolamine. Alkylation of muscarinic receptors in the heart with BM 123A had no significant effect on adenylate cyclase activity by itself but caused a functional blockade of muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. The reversible binding characteristics of both BM 123 and BM 123A were investigated in competitive binding experiments with N-[3H]methylscopolamine at 0 degree C, conditions under which little or no receptor alkylation occurs. The concentration of BM 123A required for half-maximal receptor occupancy was similar to that of oxotremorine-M whereas the parent mustard (BM 123) was 200-fold less potent. GTP (10 microM) had no significant effect on the binding of N-methylscopolamine but caused a 16-fold increase in the concentration of BM 123A required for half-maximal receptor occupancy.\r"

When expressed as NE release/stimulus, release was significantly greater from SHR preparations only at 14 Hz. Mesenteric vascular perfusion-pressure responses to PNS were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY preparations at 6 to 14 Hz. Mesenteric vascular perfusion-pressure responses to exogenous NE were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY preparations at all doses tested. Treatment of mesenteric vascular preparations from WKY and SHR with cocaine at two concentrations plus corticosterone to inhibit neuronal and extraneuronal NE uptake, respectively, increased PNS-induced overflow of NE significantly. There was no difference in the NE release/stimulus in response to PNS between WKY and SHR preparations after either concentration of cocaine. The enhanced PNS responses in SHR at higher frequencies appear to be due in part to decreased NE uptake.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence is increasing that many anesthetics and cardiovascular agents alter cellular Ca kinetics and flux. In prior work we demonstrated that the tachycardic effects of glucagon were significantly blunted by Ca channel blockade, but not by beta adrenergic receptor blockade. Thus, the chronotropic effects of glucagon may be dependent upon extracellular Ca levels. Based upon these observations, we tested the hypothesis that changes in circulating ionized Ca concentrations may alter glucagon's ability to increase heart rate in rats. In conscious normocalcemic rats, glucagon's tachycardic actions were dose related with peak effects obtained at 1 to 2 min and persisting approximately 10 min after 1.0 mg/kg of glucagon. The effects of altered Ca levels on glucagon tachycardia were evaluated in three groups of rats: 1) rats rendered hypercalcemic by the infusion of Ca chloride (10, 50 or 100 mg/ml/hr); 2) rats rendered hypocalcemic by infusion of the Ca chelator EDTA (15 or 30 mg/ml/hr); and 3) normocalcemic rats infused with saline. Normocalcemic rats had a mean ionized Ca level of 4.73 mg/dl. In rats, increasing Ca chloride doses resulted in increasing mean serum ionized Ca levels (5.24, 8.35 and 15.2 mg/dl, respectively), whereas increasing doses of EDTA produced progressive decreases in mean ionized Ca (3.62 and 2.13 mg/dl, respectively). Severe hypo (2.13 mg/dl)- or hypercalcemia (15.2 mg/dl) significantly blunted glucagon's chronotropic action (51 and 44%, respectively). From these data, we conclude that glucagon has its maximal tachycardic action at physiologic Ca levels (being blunted by both hyper- and hypocalcemia), indicating that this effect of glucagon is Ca dependent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pregnant rats were fed either semisynthetic diets supplemented with coconut oil (saturated fatty acids), sunflower oil (unsaturated) or Purina Rodent Chow. Newborns were exposed through the maternal milk and later fed the same diets throughout adulthood. Sunflower oil caused a significant decrease in the maximal response of adult atria to norepinephrine, epinephrine and isoproterenol compared with the other diets. However, no differences in contractile response to norepinephrine were detected at ages 11 and 30 days, indicating a delayed onset of the response changes. We had previously demonstrated defects in the beta adrenoceptor-adenylate cyclase system in homogenates of atria from adult rats fed sunflower oil that may partly explain the attenuated adrenergic response. Additional inotropic studies were performed to further examine the role of this system. There was no change in the maximal contractile response to agents acting through cyclic AMP [cAMP (adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate)]-independent mechanisms, calcium and phenylephrine. In contrast, maximal responses to forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and N6,2'-O-dibutyryl cAMP, which act via cAMP-dependent mechanisms, were significantly depressed by dietary sunflower oil. No differences were detected in cAMP hydrolysis by phosphodiesterase. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that alterations in adrenergic responsiveness of rat atria after dietary lipid treatment involve functional changes in the adenylate cyclase pathway distal to the enzyme.\r"

In control animals prazosin attenuated the effects of (+/-)-dobutamine on cardiac output by approximately 50%; remaining activity was blocked by propranolol. After isoproterenol infusion (+/-)-dobutamine was less efficacious and the blocking effects of prazosin were greater than 90%. Isoproterenol infusion had no effect on (-)-dobutamine-mediated (alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist) increases in cardiac output and these actions were blocked by prazosin. By contrast, compared to (+/-)- and (-)-dobutamine, effects of (+)-dobutamine (beta adrenoceptor agonist) on cardiac output were modest, not altered by prazosin and were blocked by propranolol; (+)-dobutamine was inactive after isoproterenol infusion. (-)-Dobutamine increased systemic vascular resistance in both control and isoproterenol infused rats, whereas (+)-dobutamine was inactive. (+/-)-Dobutamine increased systemic vascular resistance only in isoproterenol-infused rats. All increases in systemic vascular resistance were blocked by prazosin. Neither (+/-)- nor (+)-dobutamine significantly altered stroke volume. By contrast, (-)-dobutamine resulted in prazosin-sensitive increases in stroke volume in both control and isoproterenol-infused rats. In control animals, (+/-)-, (+)- and (-)-dobutamine increased heart rate in a dose-dependent manner; chronotropic effects of (-)-dobutamine were less than those of either (+/-)- or (+)-dobutamine. Chronotropic effects were not demonstrable in isoproterenol-infused animals. These data support the notion that in control rats cardiac output may be increased by either alpha or beta adrenoceptor stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension due to pheochromocytoma is generally considered to be a straightforward, direct consequence of the elevated concentrations of circulating catecholamines. However, clonidine, a centrally acting antihypertensive drug, has been reported to lower blood pressure in patients with pheochromocytoma, suggesting the possibility that the sympathetic nervous system is involved in the maintenance of hypertension in this disease. We have investigated this possibility in New England Deaconess Hospital rats harboring a transplantable pheochromocytoma that secretes norepinephrine and dopamine. Both clonidine and chlorisondamine, a ganglionic blocker, markedly decreased blood pressure in tumor-bearing rats. However, in other rats made acutely hypertensive with a norepinephrine infusion, neither clonidine nor chlorisondamine decreased blood pressure. This result indicates that in an acute model of hypertension, where baroreflex mechanisms have likely withdrawn sympathetic tone, neither clonidine nor chlorisondamine had nonspecific antihypertensive effects. A central nervous system site of action for the antihypertensive effect of clonidine in the rats harboring pheochromocytoma was suggested by the observation that the opiate antagonist naloxone both reversed and prevented clonidine's effect on blood pressure. Prazosin and yohimbine were utilized to determine the respective contributions of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the maintenance of hypertension in rats harboring pheochromocytoma. Both drugs markedly lowered blood pressure in these rats. Our data suggest that both the sympathetic nervous system and circulating catecholamines are involved in the maintenance of hypertension due to pheochromocytoma.\r"

The rat and dog alpha-1 receptors were found to be very similar. In the dog, KD values were 27 and 11 pM for [3H]prazosin and [125I]HEAT, respectively, whereas maximum binding values were 89 and 65 fmol/mg of protein. KD values in rat aorta were 22 and 15 pM for [3H]prazosin and [125I]HEAT, respectively, whereas maximum binding values were 62 and 47 fmol/mg of protein. Both tissues demonstrated a rank order potency of antagonist inhibition of the two radioligands consistent with an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor with prazosin greater than phentolamine greater than yohimbine. A comparison between IC50 values for both the ligands and the tissues shows strong correlations suggesting the two radioligands are identifying a similar receptor population and that the receptor labeled by the ligands has similar pharmacologic characteristics in the two tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Pharmacologic analysis of functional and radioligand binding studies were used to determine whether alterations in adrenergic receptors contribute to the catecholamine supersensitivity observed in the thoracic aorta of aldosterone hypertensive rats (AHR). Adrenergic function was evaluated using receptor-mediated contraction and rate of 42K efflux. The pA2 for phentolamine was the same in AHR (7.9 +/- 0.1 and 8.0 +/- 0.1) and control (7.9 +/- 0.2 and 8.1 +/- 0.1) rats whether measured by contraction or 42K efflux. The pA2 value for the selective alpha-1 antagonist prazosin (9.8 +/- 0.1 to 10.7 +/- 0.2) and the alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine (6.6 +/- 0.2 to 7.4 +/- 0.2) was similar in AHR and control groups using both norepinephrine and phenylephrine as agonists. The rank order of potency was prazosin greater than phentolamine greater than yohimbine in both groups. The KD for [3H]prazosin binding to AHR (26 +/- 3 pM) and control tissue (34 +/- 6 pM) agreed with the prazosin KB obtained by measurements of contraction and 42K efflux. The alpha-1 receptor density was also unaltered: 39 +/- 1 fmol/mg in AHR and 44 +/- 3 fmol/mg in control. Assessment of the NE dissociation constant (Ka) by method of fractional receptor inactivation indicated that the Ka was 4.8 X 10(-7) M in both AHR and control tissues. However, at the same receptor occupancy, the NE-induced increase in 42K efflux was elevated markedly in aorta from AHR. We conclude that alteration in adrenergic receptor density, affinity or type is not the cause of catecholamine supersensitivity in the aorta from AHR and that postreceptor events mediate this phenomenon.\r"

To this end we examined the effects of systemically administered selective antagonists and an alpha-2 agonist on kindling development and on kindled seizures. The alpha-2 adrenergic antagonists idazoxan, yohimbine and rauwolscine (0.1-10.0 mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently facilitated amygdala kindling development. Central administration of idazoxan (20 micrograms/40 microliter i.c.v.) produced an equivalent facilitation. The facilitation was selective for alpha-2 antagonists because neither the alpha-1 antagonist corynanthine (0.1-10.0 mg/kg i.p.), nor the beta antagonist propranolol (0.1-10.0 mg/kg i.p.), nor the selective beta-1 antagonist ICI 89,406 (10 micrograms/40 microliter i.c.v.) nor the beta-2 antagonist ICI 118,551 (0.5-5.0 mg/kg i.p.) modified kindling development. The alpha-2 agonist clonidine (0.01-0.2 mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently suppressed kindling development. In contrast to the effects on kindling development, neither the alpha-2 antagonists nor clonidine modified seizures elicited from previously kindled animals. We interpret the data to indicate that endogenous norepinephrine suppresses kindling development by activation of postsynaptic alpha-2 receptors. The selective inhibition of kindling development, but not kindled seizures, suggests that alpha-2 agonists may be effective antiepileptogenic, but not anticonvulsant, agents.\r"

Awake, nicardipine produced a decrease in mean arterial pressure (-12 +/- 2 mm Hg) associated with an increase in cardiac output (1.63 +/- 0.2 liters/min), heart rate (75 +/- 9 beats/min), dP/dt (741 +/- 202 mm Hg/sec) and carotid (41 +/- 11 ml/min) and coronary blood flows (39 +/- 6 ml/min). During isoflurane, responses to nicardipine injections were less pronounced except for mean arterial pressure (-19 +/- 2 mm Hg) and reversed for dP/dt (-290 +/- 63 mm Hg/sec). In a second group of six conscious dogs, nicardipine (30 micrograms/kg i.v.) injected after ganglionic blockade (chlorisondamine, 2 mg/kg i.v.) elicited changes similar to those recorded during isoflurane anesthesia, data that demonstrated the importance of isoflurane-induced baroreflex blockade as a mechanism of the pharmacodynamic interactions between nicardipine and isoflurane. Isoflurane reduced nicardipine initial volume of distribution (11.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 8.9 +/- 0.8 liters), total clearance (28.5 +/- 2.9 vs. 19.2 +/- 2.1 liters/hr) and volume of distribution at steady state (50.0 +/- 11.3 vs. 29.2 +/- 3.7 liters, P less than .05). Nicardipine-induced hemodynamic changes were linearly correlated with the drug concentrations in plasma. In the presence of isoflurane, the slopes of these relationships were reduced for all hemodynamic variables except for mean arterial pressure, for which the slope was more pronounced, and dP/dt, for which the slope was reversed. In conclusion, isoflurane alters the drug plasma concentration-effect relationship of nicardipine as a result of both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions.\r"

Adenosine and its nonmetabolizable analogs, 5'-N-ethylcarboxyamidoadenosine (NECA), N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) and 2-chloroadenosine, increased secretion, and this effect was dependent on concentration. At the highest concentration, all agonists stimulated phosphatidylcholine secretion approximately 2-fold. NECA, with an EC50 of 8.9 X 10(-8) M, was the most potent agonist. The order of potency was NECA greater than 2-chloroadenosine = L-PIA greater than or equal to adenosine greater than D-PIA. The stimulatory effect of 10(-6) M NECA was diminished by the P1 antagonists theophylline and 8-phenyltheophylline. The degree of stimulation by the adenosine analogs as well as its time course was the same as that induced by terbutaline. The effects of the adenosine analogs and of terbutaline were not additive, suggesting a similar mode of action for the beta adrenergic and purinoceptor agonists. Terbutaline and the adenosine analogs increased intracellular cyclic AMP levels. Again, NECA was the most potent adenosine analog. For NECA, L-PIA and adenosine, there was a significant correlation between effects on secretion and on cyclic AMP content. These data suggest that the effect of adenosine on phosphatidylcholine secretion in type II pneumocytes is mediated by the A2 subtype of the P1 purinoceptor.\r"

  ".W": "The overfed rat served as the animal model for examining the influence of obesity on the hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic potential of metabolically activated drugs, and acetaminophen served as the prototype drug. Weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were given a standard pellet diet or semisynthetic, energy-dense diet designed to produce obesity. After 24 weeks, when overfed rats outweighed controls by more than 50%, animals received 710 mg/kg of acetaminophen i.p., based on total body weight. Toxicity evaluation included biochemical signs of organ injury over the first 24 hr and histopathologic changes in tissue morphology at 48 hr. Both enzyme release (alanine aminotransferase into plasma, alkaline phosphatase into urine) and frank cellular necrosis in liver and kidney of obese rats greatly exceeded that in pellet-fed controls. Contributing to the potentiation of injury were higher peak plasma concentrations of acetaminophen in obese animals resulting from total body weight dosing. However, liver and kidney injury and mortality remained elevated when peak plasma concentrations were matched by fat-free mass dosing, indicating that increased toxicity also was related to obesity. Incomplete recovery of acetaminophen and metabolites from obese animals (45 vs. 71% in control rats) caused by a functional renal impairment made it impossible to determine the metabolic fate of acetaminophen in overfed animals from the analysis of urine collections. Drug products measured in urine were summed with amounts remaining in carcass at sacrifice, computed as terminal plasma concentrations times respective distribution volumes. These results showed obese rats to form more glucuronide and less sulfate conjugate than did pellet-fed controls, coinciding with clinical evidence for enhanced glucuronidation in obese humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A single 80-mg dose of propranolol p.o. together with 40 muCi of 4-[3H]propranolol was given to six smoking and seven nonsmoking, young, white, male subjects and the oral clearance of propranolol and the partial clearances through these pathways were determined. The oral clearance of propranolol was increased by 77% (P less than .02) in smokers compared with nonsmokers. This apparent induction of propranolol metabolism was due to a 122% increase in side-chain oxidation (P less than .001) and a 55% increase in glucuronidation (P less than .01). There was no significant effect of smoking on aromatic ring oxidation. Smokers had a 30% greater renal clearance of total metabolites (P less than .05), due mainly to a 53% greater renal clearance of the acidic propranolol metabolite naphthoxylactic acid (P less than .001). These data show a selective effect of smoking on propranolol metabolism and suggest that side-chain oxidation and glucuronidation are mediated by isoenzymes inducible by aromatic hydrocarbons. The selective effect of smoking on the renal clearance of the major propranolol metabolite naphthoxylactic acid may be due to induction of a renal transport protein.\r"

Administration of 40 and 100 mg/kg of AAG decreased the unbound fraction in plasma of prazosin from 0.238 to 0.175 and 0.090, respectively. Administration of 40 mg/kg of AAG decreased the clearance of prazosin with respect to unbound drug (CLu) on the average by 40%. There was no statistically significant difference in the decrease of CLu between animals given constant infusions and i.v. bolus of prazosin. Increasing the administered dose of AAG from 40 to 100 mg/kg caused no further decrease in CLu. Because prazosin is a low-to-medium extraction ratio compound in the rat, this decrease in CLu indicates that AAG has an inhibitory effect on the elimination of prazosin that goes beyond a simple protein binding effect. The apparent volume of distribution of unbound drug, steady state, VUss, decreased from 12.4 to 7.7 liters/kg, and the red blood cell/plasma water concentration ratio decreased from 9.2 to 4.0 after administration of AAG. The possible mechanisms for the observed effects are discussed.\r"

To elucidate further the role of this receptor in kidney function, we have examined the effects of all classes of diuretics on the binding of labeled PBR-specific ligands (R05-4864, PK 11195) to rat kidney membranes (13,000 X g X 10 min). Drugs capable of inhibiting R05-4864 binding by 50% at less than 200 microM included: metolazone (IC50 = 1 microM), indacrinone (IC50 = 42 microM), indapamide (IC50 = 58 microM), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; IC50 = 117 microM) and trichloromethiazide (IC50 = 175 microM). Conversely, diuretics of the loop (e.g., furosemide), K+-sparing (e.g., triamterene), and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., acetazolamide) classes exerted no significant effects on R05-4864 binding (IC50S greater than or equal to 1 mM). Inhibition by indacrinone was stereoselective. Thiazide-like compounds inhibited R05-4864 binding with a rank-order of potencies similar to that for their enhancement of in vivo natriuresis (metolazone greater than HCTZ approximately equal to trichlormethiazide greater than chlorothiazide). Scatchard analysis revealed that metolazone, indacrinone, indapamide and HCTZ inhibited R05-4864 binding by reducing Kd, with no effect on maximum binding. The apparent Kd of metolazone for the renal PBR was 3.8 X 10(-7) M. IC50 values of 14 metolazone derivatives for inhibition of R05-4864 binding correlated well (r = .71, P less than .01) with their natriuretic efficacies.

With dobutamine, (15 micrograms/kg/min) left ventricular (LV) dp/dt increased from 2220 +/- 215 (mean +/- S.E.M.) to 2815 +/- 280 mm Hg/sec and cardiac index increased from 2.9 +/- 0.2 to 3.7 +/- 0.4 liters/min/m2, whereas LV filling pressure was essentially unchanged (18.7 +/- 2.6-16.3 +/- 2.4 mm Hg). The hemodynamic effects of piroximone (50 micrograms/kg/min) were more pronounced. LV dp/dt increased from 2615 +/- 260 to 3760 +/- 410 mm Hg/sec and cardiac index from 3.0 +/- 0.1 to 4.4 +/- 0.6 liters/min/m2, whereas LV filling pressure decreased from 15.6 +/- 2.4 to 6.4 +/- 1.8 mm Hg (all P less than .05). Systemic vascular resistance index decreased from 2730 +/- 225 to 1905 +/- 256 dynes sec cm-5 m-2. Regional blood flow to the myocardium increased 48% with dobutamine and 24% with piroximone, whereas skeletal muscle flow increased 59% with dobutamine and 36% with piroximone. Renal blood flow remained unchanged with either drug. We conclude that piroximone is an inotropic agent with vasodilator properties that has an interesting hemodynamic profile somewhat similar to that of dobutamine but with the advantage of being orally active; therefore piroximone could be useful in the treatment of heart failure.\r"

Lowering of extracellular magnesium produced a potent vasorelaxant response in coronary arteries with intact endothelium, whereas in arteries with disrupted endothelium a potent vasoconstrictory response was observed. The magnitude of magnesium deficiency-induced vasorelaxation is also dependent on the extracellular calcium concentrations, such that lowering of extracellular calcium from 1.75 to 0.22 mM completely abolished the magnesium deficiency-induced vasorelaxant effects. Similar inhibition, as well as reversal, of magnesium deficiency-induced vasorelaxation was also observed with dichlorobenzamil, a known inhibitor of the Na+/Ca++ exchange mechanism, but not with nifedipine, a known inhibitor of the voltage-operated calcium channel. The magnesium deficiency-induced vasoconstriction, on the other hand, is endothelium-independent. Although a similar dependency on extracellular calcium concentration was observed in this vasoconstrictory response, nifedipine, but not dichlorobenzamil, was found to be effective in inhibiting the vasoconstrictory effect. Hemoglobin, a known inhibitor of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, also completely inhibited the magnesium deficiency-induced vasorelaxation but had no effect on the latter vasoconstrictory effect. These results suggest that circulating magnesium ion may have a dual effect in the modulation of coronary vascular reactivity. In coronary vessels with intact endothelium, lowering of extracellular magnesium may potentiate calcium-induced basal release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor and result in vasodilation, whereas in pathological vessels with injured endothelial cells, a similar lowering of magnesium may increase coronary vascular tone by accentuating the calcium-induced coronary constrictory response in vascular smooth muscle cells and result in vasoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "WEB 2086, a thieno-triazolodiazepine, is a potent and specific antagonist of platelet activating factor (PAF) in vitro and in vivo. This compound inhibits PAF-induced human platelet and neutrophil aggregation in vitro (IC50 = 0.17 and 0.36 microM, respectively) but has little or no effect on the action of other platelet aggregating agents. In comparison with kadsurenone, ketotifen or thiazinamium chloride, WEB 2086 was 26 to 200 times more potent in the PAF-induced platelet aggregation. In anesthetized guinea pigs, pretreatment with 0.1 to 2.0 mg/kg p.o. or 0.01 to 0.5 mg/kg i.v. of WEB 2086 inhibits dose-dependently the accumulation and aggregation of 111Indium labeled platelets, bronchoconstriction, systemic hypotension and also the lethal effect due to an i.v. PAF infusion [30 ng/(kg X min)] or intratracheal instillation of PAF (300 micrograms/kg). Under the same experimental conditions in guinea pigs, WEB 2086 given by inhalation achieved a similar anti-PAF activity. In anesthetized rats, the hypotension induced by an i.v. PAF infusion was also reversed (ED50 = 0.052 mg/kg i.v.). The increase in cutaneous vascular permeability due to intradermal PAF (25 ng/site) was inhibited dose-dependently by WEB 2086 (0.025-2 micrograms/site) in rats. Because of its structural relationship to triazolodiazepines, WEB 2086 was examined for anticonvulsant and sedative action. Up to doses of 300 and 800 mg/kg p.o., respectively, no effects were found. In conclusion, WEB 2086 is a potent and specific PAF antagonist with triazolodiazepine structure but without sedative activity.\r"
