  ".W": "It has been suggested that small changes in population blood pressure will have a major impact upon the incidence of cardiovascular disease caused by blood pressure elevation. Early reports indicated a close correlation between intercultural differences in salt intake and blood pressure. Before such epidemiological associations can be translated into population advice, certain conditions have to be met. The association has to be validated scientifically, and persuasive evidence has to be produced that the relationship is causal and reversible by changes in salt intake. Further, risk-benefit analysis should indicate that net harm is unlikely. Finally it has to be demonstrated that the population measures being advocated will produce an adequate change in dietary salt intake. The small individual effects upon blood pressure being examined, and the prevailing changes in blood pressure and cardiovascular mortality suggest that data will always fall short of the ideal and therefore that extrapolation will always be necessary. Nevertheless, a review of the present evidence indicates the inadequacies of the available data as a basis for population advice.\r"

  ".W": "Sodium balance is maintained by a complex set up of hemodynamic, hormonal and neural mechanisms that affect intake, reabsorption and excretion. The focus of the following research was on the cardiovascular and neuroeffector effects of dietary Na reduction primarily in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) raised from 4 to 15 weeks on a control Na diet (CNa: 12 mmol per 100 g food) or various low Na diets (LNa: 0.5 to 3 mmol per 100 g food). With regards to hemodynamics and volume regulation, the lowest Na diet reduced blood pressure 15% and raised resting heart rate (20%) in SHRs but not WKYs. Blood volume, hematocrit, plasma electrolytes, extracellular volume, and cardiac output were not different between diets or strains. However, both LNa strains were abnormally sensitive to blood loss and showed attenuated pressor responses to both acute and chronic stress situations. Cardiac function was not altered by LNa treatment in either rat strain although structural compensations occurred. LNa treatment significantly attenuated the pressor reduction in mesenteric blood flow during stress which was primarily due to reduction in noradrenergic transmitter release and not due to altered receptor sensitivity, density, or Na/K ATPase activity. Compensatory sympathetic activity was increased as was sodium conservation through humoral mechanisms which maintained homeostasis. However, further neurohumoral compensation was markedly reduced. The data suggests that the hygienic sodium intake in humans should be experimentally defined before generalized measures are taken to reduced dietary sodium use throughout society.\r"

A conceptual framework for causal inference is summarized; then the designs and results of observational and intervention studies are presented. Of 25 reports of observational studies relating intake of calcium or calcium-rich foods to blood pressure, the majority found some evidence of an inverse association. However, many analyses did not support this relationship, and only two studies have confirmed the inverse association with a prospective design. Nineteen randomized controlled clinical trials of calcium supplementation have been reported, excluding those exclusively in pregnant women. Eleven of these showed no significant effects on blood pressure; in two trials, both systolic and diastolic pressure were significantly reduced; and in the remainder results were equivocal. Pooled analyses yielded estimates of a small (1.8 mm Hg), significant reduction in systolic blood pressure, but no effect on diastolic pressure. Epidemiologic relationships with serum and urinary calcium, and the possible mechanisms of these effects, are also discussed. We conclude that the evidence from studies in humans is suggestive, but not conclusive, regarding a role for calcium in hypertension. Recommendations for further epidemiologic studies are presented.\r"

The variable blood pressure responses to calcium supplementation could not be predicted on the basis of routine biochemical parameters and appeared to be due to differences in the backgrounds of the subjects and/or the design and size of the trials. It is concluded that further studies are required on the hypotensive effect of calcium supplementation.\r"

The mechanisms by which this decrease come about are not clear. A membrane-stabilizing effect wrought by an increase in extracellular calcium would appear unlikely, since the increases in extracellular calcium concentration with increased dietary intake are minimal. Calcium regulatory hormones may be the mediators, and a cybernetic framework has been suggested. Striking defects have been reported in the calcium handling and hormonal household of the spontaneously hypertensive rat. However, a clear cut relationship in terms of a hormonal \"template\" has not yet been identified in prospective experiments. Data have been presented to show that increased calcium intake has a direct effect on regulatory areas in the brain. However, the mechanisms by which such a response would be mediated are entirely unknown. Increased calcium intake may induce natriuresis. It has been suggested that increased calcium intake helps the \"salt sensitive\"; however, prospective studies to this effect have not been presented. Increased calcium intake may induce phosphaturia. However, the evidence that blood pressure lowering effects are mediated by phosphate depletion are unconvincing. Some evidence suggests that increased calcium intake may influence local regulatory processes which in turn influences cell integrity and growth. At this point, a unifying hypothesis is not available. However, the clues to various possibilities are intriguing.\r"

The hypertensive subjects (n = 75; 43 men, 32 women) had a mean blood pressure of 138 +/- 8/95 +/- 5 mm Hg as compared with 120 +/- 11/80 +/- 8 in the normotensive group (n = 40; 22 men, 18 women). Serum PTH was measured with an intact molecule immunochemiluminometric assay and 1,25(OH)2D was measured with radioimmunoassay after HPLC separation. Hypertensive men had PTH levels that were 36% higher than normotensive men (5.3 +/- 2.9 v 3.9 +/- 0.8 pmol/L, P = .005). When blood pressure was analyzed as a continuous variable, there was a direct correlation between it and serum PTH in men (r = .31, P = .004). In women, by contrast, there was no difference in serum PTH between hypertensive and normotensive subjects and no relationship between blood pressure and the serum PTH concentration. Blood pressure was inversely correlated with serum phosphorus levels in both sexes (r = -0.20, P = .04). In men, the elevated serum PTH levels and depressed serum phosphorus levels would have predicted that serum 1,25(OH)2D would be higher in the hypertensive subjects. However, that was not observed, as serum 1,25(OH)2D was slightly lower in hypertensive (38.3 +/- 15.2 pg/mL) than normotensive men (42.7 +/- 11.3, P = .21).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood pressure was higher in Dahl-S than Dahl-R (P less than .01), but was not affected by 5 days of high NaCl. On both NaCl intakes, urine calcium excretion was increased, serum calcium was decreased, and serum PTH and 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D were increased in Dahl-S compared to Dahl-R (P less than .01). On the high NaCl intake, fecal calcium was greater in Dahl-S than in Dahl-R, and net 5-day calcium balance was less positive in Dahl-S (P less than .05). Thus, alterations of calcium, PTH, and vitamin D precede NaCl-induced hypertension in Dahl-S. These alterations may contribute to the development of hypertension in this animal model.\r"

  ".W": "Although altered cellular calcium handling plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of hypertension, little attention has been focused on the impact of calcium regulating hormones on this process. Recent research provides evidence that parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, as well as newly described factors such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), exert target-organ-specific actions in cardiac and peripheral vascular tissues, are linked to the renin-aldosterone system, and thus to the control of sodium metabolism, and may directly participate in the hypertensive process, especially in low renin and salt sensitive forms of hypertensive disease. The metabolic set-point of these linked renin and calcium hormone systems, which serve to transduce environmental dietary mineral signals at the cellular level, determines the blood pressure consequences of sodium and calcium loading and/or restriction, and helps to explain the heterogeneous and seemingly inconsistent effects of these dietary maneuvers on blood pressure. Measurement of renin and calcium factors in hypertension thus provides a physiological basis for individualized therapeutic recommendations in human hypertension.\r"

Male SHR-S were begun on one of four diets at 8 weeks of age: control (0.75% NaCl/0.68% Ca2+); high NaCl (8.00% NaCl/0.68% Ca2+); high Ca2+ (0.75% NaCl/2.00% Ca2+); and high NaCl/high Ca2+ (8.00% NaCl/2.00% Ca2+). High NaCl SHR-S (X2 weeks) had higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) (161 +/- 4 mm Hg) than controls (149 +/- 3 mm Hg; P less than .05). Supplementation with Ca2+ prevented the rise in MAP in high NaCl rats, but did not alter MAP in controls. The 8% NaCl diet elevated plasma norepinephrine and reduced anterior hypothalamic (AHA) norepinephrine stores and turnover; concomitant Ca2+ supplementation restored both plasma norepinephrine and AHA norepinephrine turnover to normal. Clonidine was microinjected into the AHA of rats maintained on the four diets for 2 weeks to test the hypothesis that dietary Ca2+ supplementation prevents the previously observed NaCl-induced upregulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in AHA. Clonidine caused dose-dependent decreases in MAP that were greater in high NaCl rats than in controls. The Ca2+ supplementation prevented the exaggerated depressor response to clonidine in the high NaCl group, but not in the controls. The Ca2+ supplementation had no effect on pretreatment MAP or on MAP responses to clonidine in control NaCl-resistant SHR (SHR-R) or Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Thus, dietary Ca2+ supplementation prevents the NaCl-induced exacerbation of hypertension and augmented depressor response to clonidine in SHR-S by increasing noradrenergic input to AHA, thereby preventing the upregulation of AHA alpha 2-adrenoceptors.\r"

In addition, the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats was found to inhibit the depressor effects of parathyroid hormone. Our results confirm the presence of a circulating hypertensive factor in the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats, which may act by increasing calcium uptake in vascular smooth muscle. These findings may also help explain the secondary increase in parathyroid hormone noted in some forms of human and experimental hypertension.\r"

We explored the intestinal and renal epithelia of 12- to 14-week-old SHR and WKY using electron microscopy. Biochemical comparisons of these transport epithelia included measurements of three vitamin D dependent cellular proteins and one structural protein: alkaline phosphatase, intestinal CaBP9K, renal CaBP28K, and villin expression. Electron microscopy demonstrated a patchy loss in microvilli in the SHR, accounting for approximately 10 to 15% of the total microvillar surface. In the kidney, morphological abnormalities were observed only in the proximal renal tubule. Again, there was patchy loss of microvilli from the brush border membrane. In SHR duodenal alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly reduced compared to the WKY (0.145 +/- 0.002 v 0.186 +/- 0.002 integrated extinction/min/micron 3 X 10(3) brush border (P less than .001). Duodenal CaBP9K and renal CaBP28K were significantly reduced in SHR compared to WKY. There were no differences in villin expression. These data are consistent with the previously characterized disturbances of active calcium transport in the intestine and inappropriate renal calcium leak in the SHR. While a possible link between these disturbances and hypertension remains to be determined, this study provides supportive evidence for a primary disturbance in cell calcium handling and transporting epithelia in this form of genetic hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Isolated glomeruli were sealed in the superfusion chamber and perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution at a constant flow of 0.3 mL/min. Renin release was increased by calmodulin inhibitor, W-7, and protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7, in both SHR and WKY. SHR showed higher maximal levels of renin release by W-7 and lower maximal levels by H-7 compared to WKY. These results indicate that calmodulin and protein kinase C play inhibitory roles in renin release from juxtaglomerular cells. The calmodulin-mediated suppression mechanism in renin release appears to be augmented in the SHR, whereas the protein kinase C-mediated system is attenuated.\r"

The CaM activator was assessed by its capacity to stimulate a CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase (CaM-PDE). In Wistar rats, which were fed a high sodium diet (3.5%), BP significantly increased (P less than .01) from 106 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 8 mm Hg in parallel to an elevation of the CaM activator from 1.57 +/- 0.14 to 2.80 +/- 0.18 U. WKY, SHR, and Dahl salt-sensitive (DS/JR) and salt-resistant (DR/JR) rats were given low (0.15%) or high (2.5%) Ca diets, both with 1% sodium. In rats receiving high dietary Ca the progression of hypertension diminished and BP was lower in SHR (156 +/- 4 mm Hg) and young DS/JR rats (125 +/- 3 mm Hg) than in those receiving low dietary Ca (192 +/- 10 and 183 +/- 2 mm Hg). There was a concomitant decrease of CaM activator in these animals to levels indistinguishable from those of WKY or DR/JR rats. The activator was also found in the heart, kidneys and erythrocytes from SHM. In the presence of exogenously added CaM, lipidic extracts from the SHM heart showed augmented CaM-PDE activity relative to normotensive preparations. This difference was eliminated by trifluoperazine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To activate protein kinase C, the phorbol ester 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent tumor promoter, or 1,2-diolein, plus phosphatidylserine (PS) was used. TPA enhanced or reduced the amplitude of the contraction evoked by increased concentrations of K below 39 mmol/L or over 90 mmol/L, respectively, but consistently enhanced the resting tension at any given concentration of high K. Similar effects of TPA were observed on the Ca-induced contraction in saponin skinned muscle tissues. The enhancing action of TPA on the K-induced contraction was not related to activation of either the voltage-dependent Ca channel or the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and did not occur in the case of Ca-independent contraction in skinned muscle tissues. During the enhancement of the contraction induced by TPA, the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and the shortening velocity of contraction as measured using the slack test, were enhanced with no remarkable change in the free Ca concentration in the cytosol. TPA consistently inhibited the ACH-induced contraction accompanied by a marked reduction in free Ca due to inhibition of the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Under the assumption that TPA possesses the same action as DG, activation of protein kinase C increased the Ca sensitivity of contractile proteins in vascular smooth muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, responses of cytosolic Ca2+ to ADP in platelets of SHR were examined. Four- and seven-week-old male SHR and age- and sex-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were used. Basal levels of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in platelets and responses to ADP were estimated using fluorescent indicator fura-2 in the medium containing 1 mmol/L CaCl2 and Ca2(+)-free buffer with 1 mmol/L EGTA. Basal levels of platelet cytosolic Ca2+ of SHR were significantly higher than those of WKY at 4 and 7 weeks of age in the presence of external Ca2+. However, no significant difference was observed in basal levels of platelet cytosolic Ca2+ in the Ca2(+)-free EGTA-containing buffer between SHR and WKY. The peak cytosolic Ca2+ concentration evoked by ADP was significantly diminished in SHR compared with WKY in the absence of external Ca2+, whereas the responses of platelet cytosolic Ca2+ to ADP were similar in SHR and WKY in the presence of external Ca2+. These results suggest that release from intracellular Ca2+ store is reduced in SHR and that the regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ in SHR is more dependent on extracellular Ca2+ compared with WKY.\r"

  ".W": "The Ca2+, calmodulin (CaM)-dependent phosphorylation of the 20 kDa myosin light chain (LC20) is accepted as an important component of the regulatory mechanism in smooth muscle contraction. Since we have originally developed selective inhibitors of each process of the intracellular Ca2+ messenger system, the effect of a newly synthesized compound ML-9, a myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibitor on superprecipitation of actomyosin, isometric tension development and phosphorylation of LC20 in vascular smooth muscle was investigated. Superprecipitation of actomyosin from bovine aorta was inhibited by the addition of ML-9 in a dose-dependent manner. In chemically skinned smooth muscle cells of the rabbit mesenteric artery, ML-9 inhibited both Ca2+ and Ca2+, CaM-independent MLCK-induced contraction. In the intact vascular strips, increase in LC20 phosphorylation reached a maximal value within 10 sec from a resting value, and then declined to near the basal level during the maintained isometric force developed in response to 50 mmol/L KCl. Both the maximal rate and extent of KCl-induced contraction and the phosphorylation of LC20 were also inhibited by ML-9. It antagonized the contraction induced by various contractile agonists, such as NE, 5HT, His, and Ang II concomitant with the inhibition of LC20 phosphorylation. These results suggest that ML-9 inhibits the actin-myosin interaction through the modulation of LC20 phosphorylation via the inhibition of MLCK activity. ML-9 will aid in determining pathophysiological functions of MLCK of increased vascular contractility in hypertension.\r"

In hemodialysis patients in whom norepinephrine infusion tests were performed to determine the effect of parathyroidectomy on vascular responsiveness, the vascular response to norepinephrine (100 ng/kg/min) improved significantly (11.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg before and 17.5 +/- 2.4 mm Hg after parathyroidectomy; P less than .01). Excess parathyroid hormone appears to play an active role in reduced vascular responsiveness to norepinephrine, although the mechanisms of this effect are unknown.\r"

Prostaglandin F2 alpha induced sustained tonic vasoconstriction of rat aortic strips, accompanied by rapid increase in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) in the vascular smooth muscle cells. Prostaglandin F2 alpha also evoked rapid increase in production of inositol 1,4,5,-trisphosphate (Ins-P3). Moreover, it increased release of Ca2+ from nonmitochondrial pools in digitonin-permeabilized vascular smooth muscle cells, although this effect was much weaker than that of Ins-P3. These results suggest that the sustained action of prostaglandin F2 alpha may involve not only a rise in [Ca2+]i mediated by Ins-P3, but also a direct stimulation of Ca2+ from intracellular stores.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the calcium dependency of contractions in arteries from rats made hypertensive by aortic coarctation and in rats with genetic hypertensive (stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats). Mesenteric artery and aortic strips were suspended in tissue baths for isometric force recording and contractions to two drugs were characterized: 1) a phorbol ester, TPA (12-O-tetrade-canoylphorbol-13-acetate), and 2) the calcium channel agonist, Bay K 8644. Thoracic aortae and mesenteric arteries from hypertensive rats were more sensitive to the contractile properties of the protein kinase C activator TPA than comparable arteries from normotensive rats. In thoracic aortae from coarcted rats, the contractile activity of Bay K 8644 was potentiated compared to normotensive values. In the presence of 19.2 mmol/L KCl, responses to Bay K 8644 in thoracic aortae from normotensive rats were potentiated and did not differ from coarcted values. In contrast, contractions to Bay K 8644 and TPA in abdominal aortae obtained below the coarctation were not different from normotensive values. Upon exposure to 26.2 mmol/L KCl, contractions to Bay K 8644 in abdominal aortae were potentiated and those in aortae from coarcted rats did not differ from sham values. Contractile responses to both drugs were blocked by nifedipine and verapamil and responses were attenuated in calcium-free solution. We conclude that calcium channel function and its regulation by protein kinase C contribute to altered vascular reactivity in hypertension. Further, these abnormalities have a pressure dependency, because they did not occur in abdominal aortae from coarcted rats.\r"

The activity, however, became apparent in a plasma membrane-enriched fraction obtained from the microsomes treated with digitonin. The enzyme activity was stimulated by a purified C-kinase and by cyclic GMP or a purified cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase). In addition to the Ca2(+)-pumping ATPase which requires millimolar concentration of Mg2+ for its activity, another high affinity (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase was detected that required micromolar concentration of Mg2+ for its full activation. Cell fractionation studies suggested its localization to plasma membranes, but the biochemical characteristics of the enzyme indicated that the enzyme could not be a biochemical expression of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump.\r"

Simultaneous measurements of [Ca2+]cyt and muscle tension provide insight into the Ca2+ regulation of smooth muscle. The photoprotein aequorin and the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2 have been used for this purpose. Although there are some differences between aequorin signal and fura-2 signal, comparison between [Ca2+]cyt and muscle tension in vascular smooth muscle indicates that high K+ and agonists that operate via specific receptors (receptor-agonists) induce sustained contraction whereas stimulated [Ca2+]cyt gradually decreases during prolonged exposure to agonists. Furthermore, greater contraction is produced by receptor-agonists than high K+ at a given [Ca2+]cyt. By contrast, cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP decrease muscle tension more strongly than [Ca2+]cyt. These results suggest that contractility of vascular smooth muscle is regulated not only by [Ca2+]cyt, but also by other mechanisms, possibly including Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile elements. Ca2+ sensitization may be due to activation of protein kinase C.\r"

To determine the accuracy of echocardiography in rats, blinded crossectional area (CSA) and LV mass measurements using either the cube function (LVM) or an elliptical model (LVMel) from high resolution M-mode echocardiograms were compared to necropsy LV weight (0.28 to 1.5 g), in 41 normotensive (body weight 116 to 762 g) and 17 hypertensive rats (350 to 560 g). Postmortem chamber volumes in 28 normal rats (0.02 to 0.19 mL) were also compared to echocardiographic volumes derived from the elliptical model. Correlation with LV weight was r = 0.87 for LVM, 0.90 for CSA and 0.93 for LVMel (all P less than .00001). Comparison of hypertensive and body-weight-matched normotensive rats revealed the upper normal limit for both LVMel and CSA to have 89% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detection of post mortem LV hypertrophy. Necropsy LV volumes were more closely related to systolic echocardiographic volumes than to diastolic volumes (r = 0.78 v 0.71, both P less than .00001), compatible with the effects of post mortem contracture. Stroke volume determined invasively in 5 Wistar rats by thermodilution was similar to that obtained using elliptical model echo volumes in 5 rats of the same body size (0.35 +/- 0.05 v 0.30 +/- 0.06 mL/beat). Echocardiography can be used to evaluate LV structure and function in rats and to detect in vivo LV anatomic differences induced by hypertension.\r"

The two cuffs were a standard size cuff (12 X 35 cm) and a newly developed cuff, containing three rubber bags of different sizes, which automatically selects the appropriately sized bag in relation to arm circumference (Tricuff, Pressure Group AB, Sweden). The Tricuff correctly placed 42 of the 43 patients in the \"normotensive\" range, ie, diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, whereas the standard cuff put only 33 of 44 patients in this range (P less than .005). The discrepancy was not only due to the expected better performance in patients with obese arms, but also in the subgroup of patients with arms in the range 22 to 31 cm, in which group both cuffs would measure blood pressure with a 12 cm wide rubber bag. The number of correctly identified \"normotensive\" patients was noticeably higher with the Tricuff than with the standard cuff (30/31 v 25/32, P = .053). The better specificity of the new cuff thus offers an improvement over the standard cuff. There are several potential clinical advantages of this, mainly that the risk of erroneously labelling normotensive individuals as hypertensive is reduced.\r"

Pump stimulation appeared to be secondary to sodium entry through Na+:H+ exchange because it was absent in Na+ loaded cells and in the presence of ethyl-isopropyl-amiloride. Cotransport stimulation was blocked by indomethacin, suggesting the involvement of a cyclooxygenase product. In conclusion, the monovalent ionic perturbations associated to the vasoconstrictor and mitogenic actions of endothelin-1 are counterbalanced by activation of the Na+,K+ pump and the [Na+,K+,Cl-]-cotransport system.\r"

The values of outer hyperfine splitting and order parameter (S) were significantly higher in subjects with essential hypertension than in the normotensive subjects. This finding indicates that the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes was lower in essential hypertension. Calcium-loading of erythrocytes with the Ca-ionophore A23187 decreased the membrane fluidity (S value was increased) more strongly in essential hypertension than in the normotensive subjects. Furthermore, this Ca-induced change in membrane fluidity was significantly correlated with age in essential hypertension. These results demonstrate that the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes is markedly decreased by calcium, especially in essential hypertension in older patients. This suggests an increased calcium-sensitivity of cell membranes in the aged hypertensive patient.\r"

The results show that the device, while highly accurate, tended to become less so as pressure increased. However, its accuracy was superior compared to most other devices we have tested, and because of features, such as a computer memory that stores events and blood pressure over time, this monitor will likely be a useful tool for clinical trials of long term blood pressure change.\r"

The details of these mechanisms are poorly understood. Steroids, acute and chronic rejection, recurrent renal disease, native kidney disease, and renal artery stenosis have all been implicated in causing post-transplant hypertension. With the addition of cyclosporine, a known hypertensive agent, to the immunosuppressive armamentarium, the evaluation of post-transplantation hypertension has become difficult. Presently, medical therapy is initially directed toward the complications of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. Empirically, converting enzyme inhibitors are added to the antihypertensive regimen. Further management is aimed at identification of specific causes of post-transplant hypertension. Unfortunately, because of the multifactorial etiology of post-transplant hypertension and a lack of detailed information about the mechanisms, medical and surgical therapy are often unrewarding. Further study is needed to clarify the mechanisms involved in post-transplant hypertension, and thus direct therapy.\r"

  ".U": "91025793\r", 
  ".W": "The alien hand sign was first described by Brion and Jedynak as a \"feeling of estrangement between the patient and one of his hands.\" The affected hand frequently shows a grasp reflex and an instinctive grasp reaction as well as elements of what Denny-Brown referred to as a \"magnetic apraxia\" associated with frontal lobe damage. Most notably, however, the affected hand is observed to perform apparently purposive behaviors that are perceived as being outside the volitional control of the patient. The patients interpret the behavior of their own affected limb as being controlled by an external agent. They do not feel that they are initiating or controlling the behavior of the hand and often express dismay at the hand's \"extravolitional\" activity. The patients attempt to control behavior of the alien hand with the unimpaired hand by forcibly restraining the affected limb, an act that may be termed \"self-restriction.\" In this paper, we report an additional four cases of alien hand sign in right-handed subjects: two involving the right hand and two involving the left hand. In each case, the clinical findings were associated with extensive unilateral damage of the medial frontal cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to the affected hand. Furthermore, the alien movement gradually disappears over the course of 6-12 months after the stroke. These clinical case studies are presented and discussed in the context of the \"dual premotoer systems hypothesis,\" an anatomicophysiological model that proposes that action is organized by two separate but interactive premotor brain systems corresponding to evolutionarily defined medial and lateral cortical moieties. It is hypothesized that the alien mode behavior results from unconstrained activity of the lateral premotor system in the damaged hemisphere. The residual volitional control in the limb occurs through the activity of the intact medial premotor system of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Recovery may occur through extension of these ipsilateral control mechanisms by compensatory changes in subcortical systems controlling hemispheric activation associated with adaptive behavior. This observation may be important in understanding mechanisms involved in motor recovery after stroke.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of local deep microwave hyperthermia (LDMWH) on normal and Zymosan-induced arthritis has been evaluated in 12 rabbits (24 joints). LDMWH, four treatments to each joint (twice weekly for a period of 2 wk), was generated by an antenna operating at 915 MHz for 60 min, reaching an intraarticular temperature of 42.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C. A surface cooling system was used with the microwave apparatus. Two weeks after the last treatment, all animals were sacrificed. The application of LDMWH on normal joints induced a limited proliferation of the synovial lining cells with a minimal perivascular infiltration of mononuclear and neutrophil cells. However, no histologic damage to the skin, muscles, bone, cartilage or bone marrow adjacent to the heated joints could be noted. Induction of Zymosan arthritis (2 wk before LDMWH) was characterized by pannus formation and granulomatous reaction accompanied by fibrinoid deposits and disseminated necrotic foci in the synovial intima. The LDMWH treatment on the examined arthritic joints brought about a reduction in the degree of granulomatous reaction concomitant with the appearance of some fibrocytes and fine collagen fibrils. These findings suggest that LDMWH can be safely applied, even repeatedly, without morphologic evidence of damage to any normal mesenchymal tissue. Moreover, it reduces the inflammatory process in experimentally induced synovitis.\r"

Subjects were 90 male warehouse workers randomly selected from over 800 employees at a grocery distribution center. Subjects were assigned to three groups: true controls, no back school, no brace orthoses; back school only; and back school plus wearing a custom molded lumbosacral orthosis. Comparisons of pre-testing and 6-month follow-up post-testing for abdominal strength, cognitive data, work injury incidence and productivity and use of health care services were evaluated. Controls and training-only group showed no changes in strength productivity or lost time. Orthoses and training-group showed no changes in strength productivity or accident rate; however, they showed substantially less lost time. This study supports the concept of using education and prophylactic bracing to prevent back injury and reduce time loss. It appears that the use of intermittent prophylactic bracing has no adverse affects on abdominal muscle strength and may contribute to decreased lost time from work injuries.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies in the psychiatric literature indicate that baclofen has an anxiolytic action in certain psychopathologic conditions. Clinical observation has shown that manifestations of spasticity are increased in anxious individuals, implicating a supraspinal site of mediation for these responses. The purposes of this study were to determine if baclofen reduced anxiety in individuals with traumatic spinal cord lesions and whether that reduction was correlated with decreased spasticity from the baclofen. Five adult males with traumatic spinal cord injury were randomly assigned to the study protocol. A double-blind, repeated measures, multiple base-line, single-case research design was employed. The independent variable was dose of medication with the three levels being placebo, 40 mg/day of baclofen and 80 mg/day of baclofen, in four evenly divided doses. The dependent variable was the score obtained on the Beck Inventory-A anxiety scale (BIA). The subjects were administered the BIA twice per week for a nine-week period of time, during which they received the doses of medication as described. Quantitative measurements of spasticity were also taken at each session. Visual inspection analysis of the data showed that two subjects had no measurable anxiety of the BIA throughout the study. Three subjects had measurable anxiety on the BIA during the base-line/placebo phase. They showed a decreased level of their BIA scores with 40 mg/day of baclofen, and a further level reduction with 80 mg/day of baclofen. The reduction in BIA scores was statistically significant using the standard deviation band test in one of these subjects. These data indicate that BIA probably has an anxiolytic effect for individuals status post-traumatic spinal cord injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

HIV did not impair PBM viability, and actinomycin D (Act D) pretreatment of HIV-infected target cells restored their susceptibility to PBM-mediated lysis. Either antibody to CD4 (Leu3a) or a recombinant vaccinia virus that induces expression of the HIV envelope protein, also inhibited target cell lysis by PBM. These studies indicate that CD4 can function as a mediator of PBM cytolytic function, and that target cell expression of the HIV-1 envelope protein may inhibit monocyte-mediated antitumor responses.\r"

Among the possible NK-susceptible target cells in an infected individual, the monocyte/macrophages are of special significance since they may serve as both a reservoir of HIV and aid in dissemination of the virus throughout the body. A new technique for the enrichment and cultivation of large numbers of recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2)-stimulated NK cells has been developed which provides cells with high cytotoxic activity. These IL-2-activated NK cells, adherent lymphokine-activated killer cells (A-LAK), can kill monocytes infected with HIV for 24 h to 7 days, with optimal target sensitivity between 3 and 7 days. Recognition and killing of the infected monocytes did not appear to be restricted by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and could be cold-target inhibited by tumor cell lines. A-LAK cells may be useful in newer therapeutic approaches to treatment of HIV infection.\r"

To further delineate the interactions between HIV-1 and host cells, the susceptibility and permissivity of normal human peripheral blood-derived monocyte/macrophages (M/M) and T lymphocytes, and neoplastic monocytoid and lymphoid cell lines to various HIV-1 isolates was assessed. The results suggest: (1) \"fresh\" isolates recovered from patients and propagated only in normal host cells exhibit a dual tropism for both M/M and T cells, regardless of their tissue of origin or the cell type from which they were isolated; (2) the repeated passage of an HIV-1 isolate through normal M/M does not generally result in the loss of the ability to infect normal T cells nor vice versa; (3) the majority of fresh HIV-1 isolates do not infect neoplastic cells of either origin, and those that do show no preference for monocytoid or lymphoid targets, regardless of their cell origin.\r"

In detailed studies on TNF alpha, HIV infection did not affect the regulation of TNF alpha in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. In an effort to examine the interferon responsiveness of HIV-infected macrophages, the cells were challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with or without interferon pretreatment. Surprisingly, HIV-infected macrophages were completely resistant to VSV-induced lysis even in the absence of interferon; however, no interferon was detected in the supernatants of these infected cells. The resistance of HIV-infected macrophages to superinfection with VSV indicates a previously undescribed effect of HIV upon macrophage cellular metabolism.\r"

We report here the inhibition of syncytium formation between HIV-infected macrophages and uninfected CD4-expressing T-lymphoid cells by monoclonal antibody S3.5, directed against an epitope of CD4 involved in binding HIV gp120, by a recombinant protein that comprises the full-length extracellular domain of the CD4 molecule, and by recombinant full-length HIV envelope glycoprotein, gp120. These results indicate that both molecules (gp120 and CD4) are critical to the fusion process, and suggest that gp120 is expressed on the surface of HIV-infected monocyte-macrophages.\r"

The current studies were performed to test the selectivity of the observed inhibitory effects on HIV replication in chronically infected macrophages infected in vitro. Peripheral blood-derived monocyte/macrophages were infected in vitro and cultivated in suspension for at least two weeks prior to GLQ223 treatment. Anti-HIV effects were quantitated by measurement of cytoplasmic HIV p24, by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry and HIV RNA levels were measured by slot blot analysis. Incorporation of [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid- (TCA) precipitable protein was also evaluated as an index of nonspecific inhibitory effects mediated by the compound in infected and uninfected cultures. Five days after a single 3-h treatment with GLQ223 there was a concentration-dependent decrease in all measurable HIV parameters within infected cultures. The anti-HIV effects persisted at least 28 days without evidence for increasing HIV expression. GLQ223 treatment of parallel uninfected macrophage cultures showed no significant inhibition of tritiated leucine uptake. These experiments demonstrate that a single pulsed exposure with GLQ223 of macrophages infected with HIV in vitro caused a sustained, concentration-dependent decrease in both HIV p24 antigen levels as well as HIV RNA without causing measurable toxicity in uninfected cultures.\r"

  ".W": "Monocyte/macrophages (M/M) are an important target cell for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the body. The study of HIV infection in these cells, however, is rather complicated because they represent a variable population, and because HIV entry and replication in M/M may be markedly influenced by a number of factors. These must be considered in therapeutic approaches to HIV infection. In the present set of experiments, we studied the interaction between certain agents which increase the infection of monocyte/macrophages (M/M) by HIV and two groups of anti-HIV agents: dideoxynucleosides and specific inhibitors of gp120-CD4 binding. We found that the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which markedly enhances HIV replication in M/M, does not affect the activity of recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) or OKT4A, two agents which block gp120-CD4 binding. However, it had varying effects on different dideoxynucleosides: GM-CSF increased the net anti-HIV activity of 3'-azido2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT), while at the same time it reduced the activity of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI). These effects probably represent an interplay between varying effects of GM-CSF on drug entry and phosphorylation. In additional experiments, we showed that very low concentrations of anti-HIV antibodies could enhance HIV infection of the U937 monocytoid cell line. Interestingly, while this effect has been hypothesized to occur through a CD4-independent mechanism, we found that the anti-HIV activities of both sCD4 and OKT4A were unchanged under conditions of enhancement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, mixtures of lymphocytes and macrophages can synthesize all virus proteins. Infection requires physical association of monocyte-macrophages and lymphocytes in \"clusters.\" These studies with influenza virus suggest that the pathogenesis of virus infections in mixed cell cultures may be very different from that observed in purified cell populations, and they suggest that similar studies should be performed with HIV.\r"

HIV isolates that replicate in macrophages will also replicate in lymphocytes; however, isolates adapted to lymphoid cells (such as HIV-HTLVIIIB) will not replicate in macrophages. The envelope gene appears to be a major determinant of the cell tropism of viral isolates. T-cell grown virus stocks synthesize abundant gp120, while virus grown in macrophages contains relatively much less gp120. Electron microscopy of virions from macrophages shows them to be depleted of gp120 surface \"spikes.\" Recombination studies show that the portion of the genome coding for the envelope glycoprotein appears to determine cell tropism. Lastly, rsCD4 neutralized macrophage-tropic isolates less efficiently than T-cell tropic isolates. HIV replication in macrophages is partially under the control of cellular factors, although these have been less well characterized than they have in lymphocytes.\r"

Monocytes were obtained from blood of normal donors by Ficoll/hypaque gradient centrifugation and adherence. These cells were allowed to mature in the presence of varying concentrations of cytokines. After five days in culture, cells were harvested, counted, and inoculated with S5G7, an HTLV-IIIB subclone. The cells were replated in the presence of the same concentrations of cytokines. Culture supernatants were sampled over 28 days for p24 antigen (Ag) as measured by Ag capture assay. In repeat experiments, the following observations were made: 1. MDM from some donors could be infected only in the presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin 4 (IL-4); 2. The effect of GM-CSF was variable; TNF alpha also enhanced HIV replication above controls; 3. IL-4 was the most potent enhancer of HIV-1 replication in MDM of the cytokines tested, inducing p24 Ag levels 75-230 times those seen in control cultures run simultaneously. This effect was dose dependent. Ag production was not observed until Day 14 postinfection in most experiments. Multinucleated giant cell formation was observed only in the presence of IL-4.\r"

Adherent cells were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and were analyzed by various technical approaches. The cells considered here were alveolar macrophages and fibroblasts, and could be clearly identified morphologically and by the expression of specific cell-surface markers using monoclonal antibodies. The presence of HIV-1 in both of these cell types was established by serological, virological, and molecular procedures. Our results show that alveolar macrophages and fibroblasts are naturally infected in the lungs of HIV+ patients. Both cell types express the CD4 receptor molecule, in contrast to skin fibroblasts which are negative. Alveolar macrophages and fibroblasts thus may act as eventual HIV-1 reservoirs in vivo, and are probably involved in the induction of inflammatory reactions because they are targets for CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).\r"

IgG antibodies to HIV-1 will enhance infectivity in cells (such as monocyte-macrophages) that have surface Fc receptors; F(ab')2 fragments of antibodies did not enhance, and blocking of FcR inhibited enhancement. The high-affinity FcR for IgG (Fc gamma RI) appeared to be functional. Sera from HIV-1-infected patients had neutralizing activity at high concentrations, but enhanced infection at low concentrations (i.e., high dilutions). Our studies show that the CD4 receptor is required for antibody-mediated enhancement of infection, as enhancement can be blocked by recombinant soluble CD4 and by Leu3 antibody. Although enhancement can be demonstrated in vitro, the in vivo importance of enhancing antibodies remains to be defined in HIV-1 infection.\r"

Fifteen patients undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery were studied by previously described assays for peroxidised lipids and for isomerised lipids which were used as indices of free radical activity. Serial blood samples were obtained from systemic arterial, mixed venous, and coronary sinus catheters before, during, and after the ischaemic period. The patients underwent coronary artery surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass with a membrane oxygenator, relative hypothermia 30-34 degrees C, and intermittent cross-clamping of the aorta. During the ischaemic periods there were no significant changes in the indices of free radical activity. During the reperfusion phase there was a significant increase in free radical indices in arterial and mixed venous blood. A small rise in free radical indices in coronary venous blood was not statistically significant. These data indicate that free radical activity is increased in patients shortly after the cessation of cardiopulmonary bypass. The pattern of distribution between the different sampling sites suggests that much of the observed increase in isomerised and peroxidised lipids originates from tissues other than the myocardium.\r"

Results in patients and controls were compared and matched pairs with identical cardiovascular risk factors were also selected. Blood viscosity and red cell aggregation were increased and red cell deformability was decreased in the 51 patients. The abnormalities were independent of the interval since infarction and persisted for years. The rheological abnormalities present after myocardial infarction are at least partly independent of the acute event and acute phase reactions. They contribute to the reduced perfusion of the microcirculation of the heart.\r"

Twenty two of the patients had sustained a previous myocardial infarct and 18 were on long term treatment with amiodarone. Sustained (greater than 30 s) ventricular tachycardia was induced in all patients. Two extrastimuli were significantly more likely to induce sustained ventricular tachycardia than one extrastimulus, both overall and individually for the three ventricular drive rates. A ventricular drive rate of 140 beats/min was significantly more likely to induce ventricular tachycardia than ventricular drive rates of 100 and 120 beats/min which were significantly more effective than sinus rhythm. A ventricular drive rate of 140 beats/min with one or two extrastimuli induced ventricular tachycardia in 23/24 (95%) of the patients in this study. The full eight stage protocol was progressive separately for both extrastimuli and ventricular drive rate but the last two stages (ventricular drive rate of 140 beats/min with one or two extrastimuli) were as effective as the entire protocol in inducing ventricular tachycardia.\r"

The results (mean SEM) of symptom scores, a treadmill exercise test, and 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were obtained. Xamoterol improved symptom scores and controlled exercise heart rate better than digoxin. Xamoterol was better than digoxin or placebo in reducing the heart rate response to exercise and tended to improve exercise duration. Xamoterol, by reducing the daytime maximum hourly heart rate and increasing the night time minimum hourly heart rate, significantly reduced the difference between the two compared with placebo. In contrast, digoxin tended to reduce both the maximum and minimum hourly heart rates through day and night. Both the frequency and duration of ventricular pauses were reduced by xamoterol but tended to increase with digoxin. Xamoterol reduced both the circadian variation in ventricular response to atrial fibrillation and exercise tachycardia by modulating the heart rate according to the prevailing level of sympathetic activity. These changes were translated into symptomatic benefit for the patients studied.\r"

Between 1978 and 1982, 24 patients were referred to the Brompton Hospital with suspected acute thoracic aortic dissection; all had aortography with diagnosis confirmed at surgery (n = 12) or necropsy (n = 2) or supported by clinical outcome (n = 8). One patient in whom aortography was negative had type B dissection at necropsy and another patient was lost to follow up. CT scanning became available in this unit in 1983 and between 1983 and 1987 was used as the only imaging investigation in 32 patients with suspected acute dissection of the thoracic aorta while in a further 22 patients aortography was used alone. Results were confirmed at surgery (n = 18), necropsy (n = 3), or supported by clinical outcome (n = 31). Two patients were lost to follow up. In an additional 16 patients both aortography and CT scanning were performed with concordant findings in 10. In six in whom the results were discordant, aortography was normal in three in whom subsequent CT scanning showed type B dissection and CT scanning was normal in three patients in whom aortography showed type A dissection. Both CT scanning and aortography are reliable techniques for assessment of suspected acute dissection of the thoracic aorta. Both techniques misdiagnose occasionally and the frequency of misdiagnosis will be minimised by performing both investigations in patients where the level of clinical suspicion is high and the initial investigation negative. CT scanning tends to miss type A dissection and in view of the success of surgery in this condition this failing has the more serious clinical consequences.\r"

The peak filling velocities during the early and atrial phases of left ventricular diastole and their ratio (E:A ratio) were measured. All patients with diabetes had a normal serum concentration of creatinine and exercise electrocardiogram. The mean E:A ratio was significantly lower in those with proteinuria than in the diabetic controls because of an increase in peak atrial filling velocity; most patients with proteinuria had an abnormal E:A ratio of less than 1.0. Multiple regression analysis showed that systolic blood pressure was the major determinant of both the peak filling velocity during the atrial phase of diastole and also left ventricular mass. Blood pressures were significantly higher in the proteinuria group than in the diabetic controls. Glycaemic control and autonomic function did not influence diastolic filling. The slightly raised blood pressures at the earliest stages of diabetic nephropathy are sufficient to alter left ventricular diastolic compliance--this may reflect early hypertensive heart disease. These data do not preclude a specific heart muscle disease related to diabetes, but suggest that these slightly raised blood pressures contribute significantly to left ventricular dysfunction in these patients, in whom the risk of cardiovascular disease is already greatly increased.\r"

Preoperatively six patients had tricuspid atresia, six had a double inlet left ventricle, and two had pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum. The postoperative rhythm was sinus in 11 patients, junctional in one, ventricular pacing in one, and atrioventricular sequential pacing in one. In one patient the Doppler trace was unsatisfactory for analysis. In all patients forward flow in the pulmonary artery had biphasic peaks related to both atrial and ventricular contraction. The mean (SD) peak flow velocity that was synchronous with atrial contraction was 80 (30) cm/s and that synchronous with ventricular contraction was 74 (23) cm/s. The atrial contribution to total pulmonary artery flow, assessed by velocity-time integrals, varied between 22% and 73% (mean (SD) 45 (14)%). In patients with tricuspid atresia the mean (SD) peak flow velocity with atrial contraction was 90 (27) cm/s and that with ventricular contraction was mean (SD) 68 (24) cm/s. In patients with double inlet left ventricle the mean (SD) peak flow velocity was 67 (36) cm/s with atrial contraction and 80 (25) cm/s with ventricular contraction. The atrial contribution to total pulmonary blood flow in patients with tricuspid atresia was significantly higher (53 (11)%) than in those with double inlet left ventricle (37 (14)%). Pulmonary artery flow after modified Fontan operation was biphasic and was related to both atrial and ventricular contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The coarctation site was crossed and the balloon inflated in all but one patient. In two patients with associated severe isthmal hypoplasia there was no change in the gradient after dilatation. In the remainder, the residual gradients were trivial and angiography showed complete relief of coarctation. Severe recoarctation developed 5-12 weeks after dilatation in five patients, each considered to have had an excellent initial result. The coarctation was rapidly progressive in three patients in whom Doppler studies within two weeks of the development of recoarctation had shown no significant gradient. In the other two patients progressive restenosis was charted by Doppler examinations over the course of 6-8 weeks. Three patients had a second, initially successful, dilatation procedure. One patient remained well with no residual gradient 18 weeks later. Stenosis recurred within eight weeks in the other two, and both have undergone successful surgical repair. Balloon dilatation of a native coarctation of the aorta gave excellent immediate results in most neonates. Severe isthmal hypoplasia is, however, a contraindication to balloon dilatation and early restenosis is an important problem. These results do not support the continued use of primary balloon dilatation of coarctation of the aorta in neonates.\r"

The results suggested that longitudinal transoesophageal imaging complements the transverse axis approach. It gave new imaging information on the right ventricular outflow tract and the pulmonary trunk, the atrioventricular valves, the interventricular septum, the cardiac apex, and the thoracic aorta. In particular, it showed the entire length of the right ventricular outflow tract. When longitudinal imaging was used in combination with transverse imaging almost all the thoracic aorta could be examined. Imaging in the longitudinal axis may also allow better assessment of the mechanisms of atrioventricular valve regurgitation.\r"

  ".U": "91026675\r", 
  ".W": "We determined in 51 healthy patients undergoing body surface surgery the dose requirements for propofol, as part of a total i.v. anaesthesia technique with an alfentanil infusion. After premedication with temazepam, patients received alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1 followed by an infusion of 50 micrograms kg-1 h-1. Patients were anaesthetized with a loading dose of propofol followed by a three-stage infusion designed to reach one of five preselected blood concentrations of propofol. The motor response to the initial surgical incision was noted and probit analysis was used to derive the ED50 (2.94 mg kg-1 h-1; 95% confidence limits: 2.35-3.37 mg kg-1 h-1) and ED95 (4.98 mg kg-1 h-1; 95% limits: 4.13-8.8 mg kg-1 h-1) for the final propotol infusion rate under these conditions. Whole blood concentration!of propofol at the time of the incision was related linearly to the inf!sion rate and the EC50 and EC95 (probit analysis) were derived as !.44 (95% confidence limits 0.62-1.87) and 4.05 (95% confidence lim!ts 2.78-30.5) micrograms ml-1, respectively. Post-operative recovery was!rapid, uncomplicated and uneventful. In a subgroup of eight patients,!the addition of clonidine 0.6 mg to the premedication significantly decreased the requirement for propofol (P less than 0.05) during surgery, but resulted in prolonged recovery times.\r"

In the second experiment, the alfentanil-induced analgesia was antagonized by naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. The reaction time to pain was prolonged significantly 15 min after injection, whereas the latency of the pain-related potential remained constant.

The latency and amplitude of the SSEP response over the second cervical vertebra (SC) and sensory cortex (P17, N20, P25), heart rate and arterial pressure were recorded for 30 min after the injection of sufentanil. A significant increase in mean latency occurred for N20 (P less than 0.003) and P25 (P less than 0.002) within 2 min, but the absolute increase in latency was small. The mean amplitudes of all peaks decreased to 60% (SC), 70% (P17), 60% (N20) (P less than 0.012) and 45% (P25) of the baseline value within 7 min. The results suggest that the major change in median nerve SSEP produced by this dose of sufentanil is a reduction in amplitude, and that major changes in latency after sufentanil and pancuronium are probably caused by other influences.\r"

The mean recovery time after discontinuation of the infusion was significantly longer in the cirrhotic group; however, when patients opened their eyes, blood concentrations of propofol were similar in both groups (1 micrograms ml-1). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed from the beginning of infusion to 8 h after termination. Total body clearance was not reduced significantly in cirrhotic (1.56 (SD 0.48) litre min-1) compared with control (1.75 (0.32) litre min-1) patients. The volume of distribution at steady state was significantly greater in patients with cirrhosis than in control patients (202 (82) litre vs 121 (49) litre). However, this difference did not change terminal elimination half-life. The pharmacokinetics of propofol given by infusion to maintain general anaesthesia were not affected markedly by moderate cirrhosis.\r"

Peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) was calculated from perfusion pressure and pump flow. After propofol, PVR decreased from 1767 (SD 415) dyn s cm-5 to a minimum of 1263 (283) dyn s cm-5 at 2 min, and remained significantly less than the control value until 12.5 min after administration of propofol. In the group given the vehicle, PVR did not change significantly. In a second study in 10 patients, venous blood samples were withdrawn before and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20 and 30 min after injection of propofol 2 mg kg-1 during cardiopulmonary bypass, for measurement of blood concentrations of propofol. Concentrations were greater than predicted by a computer simulation based on published pharmacokinetic data. The decrease in PVR may be an important factor in the hypotension caused by propofol during induction of anaesthesia.\r"

Midazolam caused dose-dependent central neural depression as assessed by critical flicker fusion frequency, and dose-dependent amnesia for word cards. In subjects given flumazenil 5 min after administration of midazolam, fusion frequency readings and memory were restored to levels comparable to those before midazolam administration. These two effects of flumazenil were similar in time course and extent, suggesting that they share the same mechanism of action. Flumazenil given alone had no effect on memory. The study has demonstrated anterograde amnesia following benzodiazepine administration and antagonism by flumazenil. There was neither retrograde amnesia nor retrograde antagonism of amnesia.\r"

The above volumes were calculated by digital integration of the appropriate regions of flow curves derived from a pneumotachograph placed between the bias flow tubing and the tracheal tube. At a driving pressure of 1 bar, lung minute ventilation increased with increasing ventilatory frequency, whilst tidal volumes decreased. The contribution of entrainment to tidal volume (Ve/VT) remained constant, although the volumes entrained were relatively small and varied widely from subject to subject. Blowback volumes were considerable, especially at ventilatory frequencies used clinically (1-2 Hz). We conclude that it is not possible to entrain predictable concentrations of volatile agents from the low pressure bias flow during HFJV.\r"

Mean (SD) plasma concentration of methadone was 9.8 (2.1) ng ml-1 at 15 min; this did not change significantly during the first 2 h, after which it increased gradually to 32.2 (4.6) ng ml-1 (P less than 0.001) at the end of 24 h. The mean quantity of extradural methadone required to produce effective analgesia was 10.3 (1.8) mg during the first 12 h after operation and 6 (1.0) mg for the subsequent 12 h. The mean amount of methadone for effective analgesia on the second day was 7.6 (1.1) mg. No adverse effects were detected during the 2-3 days of methadone therapy. Plasma concentration of methadone increased significantly during patient-controlled infusion of extradural methadone in the first 24 h after operation, suggesting rapid vascular uptake. Systemic activity of the drug contributes to the analgesic effect of extradural methadone.\r"

  ".W": "It has been demonstrated in several species that a significant increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) occurs when nitrous oxide is added to a volatile anaesthetic. This blood flow response could result from an increase in cerebral metabolic rate or from a direct effect of nitrous oxide on cerebral vessels. To investigate this, the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglu) was determined autoradiographically in rats receiving isoflurane anaesthesia with or without nitrous oxide. An increase in anaesthetic depth from 0.5 to 1.0 MAC achieved with isoflurane alone caused a significant reduction in CMRglu (52 (SD11) mumol/100 g min-1 vs 39 (8)mumol/100 g min-1). In contrast, the addition of 70% nitrous oxide (0.5 MAC) to 0.5 MAC isoflurane anaesthesia (1 MAC total) left CMRglu unchanged (54 (4) mumol/100 g min-1). We conclude that 70% nitrous oxide does not alter cerebral metabolic rate when administered with 0.5 MAC isoflurane. Because CBF increases substantially under very similar conditions, our data indicate that the CBF effects of nitrous oxide, when administered with a volatile agent, were direct and mediated by factors other than changes in cerebral metabolic rate.\r"

Mean block times after suxamethonium 1 mg kg-1 were 8.0 min, 9.83 min and 12.45 min for control and metoclopramide 10 mg and metoclopramide 20 mg groups, respectively. A laboratory study was therefore conducted on the inhibition of human plasma cholinesterase (PCHE) and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) activity by varying concentrations of metoclopramide using acetylthiocholine as substrate. PCHE showed a greater sensitivity to inhibition by metoclopramide; the concentration of metoclopramide producing 50% inhibition of activity (I50) was 3.16 x 10(-7) mol litre-1, which is within the therapeutic range. ACHE was less sensitive to inhibition by metoclopramide (I50 2.24 x 10(-5) mol litre-1). Analysis of enzyme kinetics at varying substrate concentrations revealed that metoclopramide produced a potent non-competitive, dose-dependent inhibition of both ACHE and PCHE. The inhibition constant, Ki, was 1.88 x 10(-7) mol litre-1 for PCHE and 9.5 x 10(-8) mol litre-1 for ACHE. As metoclopramide is a potent inhibitor of PCHE, interactions might be expected to occur between metoclopramide and drugs that require PCHE for biotransformation, such as suxamethonium and ester local anaesthetics.\r"

Aspiration of 0.4 ml kg-1 and 0.6 ml kg-1 at pH1 produced mild to moderate clinical and radiological changes, but no deaths. Aspiration of 0.8 ml kg-1 and 1.0 ml kg-1 at pH1 was associated with an increasingly severe pneumonitis. At 1.0 ml kg-1, 50% of the animals died--a mortality rate considerably less than that reported previously in animal studies. If these results were to be extrapolated to humans, the critical volume for severe aspiration could be increased from 25 ml to 50 ml (0.8 ml kg-1), considerably reducing the percentage of patients perceived to be \"at risk\".\r"

One group received fentanyl 15 micrograms kg-1 i.v. immediately before the start of surgery; a second group received fentanyl 15 micrograms kg-1 i.v. together with corticotrophin releasing factor 100 micrograms i.v., growth hormone releasing hormone 100 micrograms i.v. and arginine vasopressin 10 units i.m. The concomitant administration of the releasing factors with the opioid resulted in a significantly greater serum concentration of cortisol 30, 60, 120 and 240 min after surgery commenced, compared with the group which received fentanyl alone. Similarly, the growth hormone response in the combined group was significantly greater than in the fentanyl-alone group 30 min after the start of surgery. We conclude that the inhibitory effect of fentanyl on surgically-induced secretion of pituitary hormone was mediated directly or indirectly via the hypothalamus.\r"

The release of histamine, heparin and vasoactive substances such as prostaglandin D2 may cause severe hypotension and other anaphylactoid manifestations. Anaesthetic management should include perioperative stabilization of mast cells and avoidance of the use of histamine-releasing drugs. Intradermal skin testing is useful in predicting the sensitivity to drugs that may be used during anaesthesia. We present a patient with systemic mastocytosis who underwent uneventful cholecystectomy.\r"

The Bullard laryngoscope was as easy to master as the flexible fibreoptic device, but passage of the tracheal tube took longer. Both devices require a similar amount of practice.\r"

Recording and analysis was performed with the cerebral function analysing monitor (CFAM). At equivalent MAC, the two agents exhibited distinctive neurophysiological profiles. Increasing concentrations of isoflurane produced a clear sequence of EEG changes (decreasing fast and increasing slow components) then burst suppression activity suggesting cortical depression. With halothane, changes in EEG amplitude were less pronounced and those in frequency content less systematic, with no periods of suppression. Simultaneous BAEP showed greater latency increase with halothane than with isoflurane. Prolonged administration of 1% isoflurane was associated with a stable EEG (no periods of suppression) and BAEP.\r"

During the acute reduction in MAP, the average reduction in mean EEG amplitude with halothane was 14%, two patients showing short periods of EEG suppression; the decline in EEG amplitude correlated with declining MAP in four patients. In contrast, the average reduction in mean EEG amplitude with isoflurane was only 0.3% and there were neither periods of suppression nor any correlation between EEG amplitude and MAP. No significant changes in EEG frequency occurred in either group. Isoflurane prevented EEG amplitude depression during TMP-induced hypotension.\r"

Statistically significant changes were observed in the frequency of spontaneous contractions, peak and mean amplitude of spontaneous and provoked contractions, and the oesophageal contractility index as subjects lost consciousness and also as it was regained. The differences in LOC which occurred when subjects were conscious and unconscious support the view that LOC is related to the depth of anaesthesia, but its unreliability at the interface between consciousness and unconsciousness prevents selective detection of awareness, although the response in the presence of painful stimuli has not been tested.\r"

During anaesthesia with propofol and thiopentone, mean total body oxygen consumption decreased, respectively, by 47% (P less than 0.001) and 24% (P less than 0.01) of pre-anaesthesia baseline values, mean heart rate increased by approximately 50% (P less than 0.05) with both agents, mean arterial pressures increased by approximately 50% (P less than 0.05) with both agents and the mean cardiac output was unaltered with propofol anaesthesia but was decreased by 20% (P less than 0.05) with thiopentone anaesthesia. The changes in arterial pressure and heart rate were unexpected and may have been a result of a species-specific effect. Mean hepatic blood flow decreased consistently by a mean of 17% (P less than 0.01) during propofol anaesthesia, and inconsistently during thiopentone anaesthesia so that it was not significantly different from baseline values. Mean renal blood flow decreased during propofol anaesthesia by 7% (P less than 0.05) and by 27% (P less than 0.001) during thiopentone anaesthesia.

The other two groups (n = 4 each) were studied before (baseline values), during and after the induction and 70-min maintenance of anaesthesia with propofol or thiopentone. In the control studies, mean renal extraction ratio and clearance for cefoxitin were, respectively, 0.67-0.92 and 0.66-0.91 litre min-1 and were consistent throughout the entire study period in individual animals. Comparable values were obtained as baseline values in the anaesthesia groups. Compared with individual baseline values, blood concentrations of cefoxitin doubled during anaesthesia with each agent. At the same time, renal extraction ratio and clearance for cefoxitin each decreased significantly to about 50-60% of their control values. Recovery to control values of arterial blood concentrations and renal extraction ratio of cefoxitin took at least 5 h, but recovery of renal clearance was more rapid. The results indicate that renal elimination of an organic anion such as cefoxitin may be affected by changes in renal blood flow and in renal function produced by propofol and thiopentone; these effects may last for several hours after recovery of renal blood flow.\r"

Changes in protein metabolism, synthesis and breakdown were estimated by an isotope dilution technique using a continuous infusion of the stable isotope tracer, L-[1-13C]leucine, before anaesthesia (4 h), during anaesthesia alone (1 h), during anaesthesia and surgery (1 h) and in the recovery period (2 h). General anaesthesia comprised thiopentone, pancuronium, enflurane (1 MAC) and oxygen-enriched air. An isotopic steady state in plasma 13C-alpha-ketoisocaproate (13C alpha-KIC) and expired 13C-carbon dioxide were obtained during the four periods. Collections of plasma and expired air were made during the steady state periods and plasma alpha-KIC enrichment measured to indicate precursor pool labelling from which leucine flux (equal to protein breakdown in the post-absorptive state) and oxidation were calculated, and whole body protein synthesis was derived. Whole body protein breakdown did not change with anaesthesia, but decreased with both surgery and during the acute recovery period (P less than 0.05). Protein synthesis did not change with anaesthesia and surgery, but decreased significantly after surgery (P less than 0.05).\r"

Patients were allocated randomly to two groups (n = 10) who were treated with incremental doses of either dopexamine 1, 2 and 4 micrograms kg-1 min-1, or dopamine 2.5 and 5 micrograms kg-1 min-1, each dose being maintained for 15 min. Measurements were performed before administration of the drug and at the end of the infusion period at each dose. Fentanyl and midazolam were used as anaesthetic agents. Renal blood flow was measured with the argon washin technique. Dopexamine 4 micrograms kg-1 min-1 produced an increase in cardiac index of 117% caused by a 65% reduction in afterload and an increase in heart rate by 61%. Dopamine 5 micrograms kg-1 min-1 caused a 40% increase in cardiac index as a result of an increase in stroke volume. Renal vascular resistance decreased more than systemic vascular resistance with dopamine. With dopexamine, the increase in renal blood flow (66%) was less than the increase in cardiac index, while renal vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance declined to almost the same extent. The results show that dopexamine exerts systemic and renal effects mainly via stimulation of beta 2-receptors. An action of dopexamine at renal DA1-receptors could not be demonstrated in this study.\r"

  ".W": "The cerebral effects of sevoflurane were compared in dogs with those of enflurane and isoflurane. Initially, the minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC) of sevoflurane and enflurane were determined and the electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to increasing doses of sevoflurane (1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 MAC) or enflurane (1.5 and 2.0 MAC) in unparalysed animals were examined. Administration of sevoflurane was not associated with seizure activity at any concentration either during normocapnia (PaCO2 5.3 kPa) or hypocapnia (PaCO2 2.7 kPa), even in the presence of intense auditory stimuli. All dogs anaesthetized with enflurane demonstrated sustained EEG and motor evidence of seizure activity induced by auditory stimuli at concentrations of enflurane greater than 1 MAC, particularly during hypocapnia. In a separate group of dogs, the effects of increasing concentrations of sevoflurane and isoflurane (0.5, 1.5 and 2.15 MAC) were compared directly on arterial pressure, cardiac output and heart rate, cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) using the venous outflow technique. Sevoflurane, in common with isoflurane, had minimal effects on cerebral blood flow at the concentrations studied, but significantly reduced the CMRO2 at end-tidal concentrations sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on the EEG (approximately 2.15 MAC). Both sevoflurane and isoflurane significantly decreased arterial pressure in a dose-dependent manner, but neither drug significantly altered cardiac output.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the butyrophenone, azaperone 5 mg kg-1 i.m. alone and after addition of the imidazole derivative metomidate 6 mg kg-1 i.v. were studied in eight conscious pigs. Fifteen minutes after administration of azaperone, systemic arterial pressure was reduced by 35% as a result of a 45% increase in systemic vascular conductance and 10% decrease in cardiac output (Q). After azaperone, 23% of the radioactive labelled microspheres (15 (SD 1) microns) injected into the left atrium were detected in the lungs as a result of opening of arteriovenous anastomoses (baseline 3%). The increase in arteriovenous anastomotic blood flow was at the expense of the nutritional (= capillary) channels. Flow to the brain was maintained, but that to the left ventricle decreased in parallel with the reduction in arterial pressure. Vascular conductance of most other organs, except the skin, increased or was maintained. The addition of metomidate had no effect on Q because an increase in stroke volume (by 30%) compensated for the decrease in heart rate. Systemic vascular conductance decreased, most noticeably in the brain, left ventricle and skeletal muscle. We conclude that azaperone alone and in combination with metomidate had only a moderate effect on Q, but caused a redistribution in favour of arteriovenous anastomoses.\r"

Eleven subjects were found to be MH susceptible (MHS) and 15 subjects MH-negative (MHN). In all patients, relaxation rate was recorded at three different temperatures of the skin overlying adductor pollicis (30, 34 and 38 degrees C) achieved by a small surface heating unit placed over the thenar eminence. The MHS group exhibited slightly higher relaxation rate at 34 and 38 degrees C compared with the MHN group and this difference was accentuated with increasing temperature, but was not statistically different. The results of the present study suggest that relaxation rates are normal in MHS individuals under physiological conditions and cannot be used diagnostically for MH screening.\r"

Although the T4:T1 ratio was improved to 0.9, T1 remained at 25% of control, and significant paralysis persisted which responded to administration of cholinesterase.

DESIGN--A randomized controlled trial. SETTING--Harare Maternity Hospital, Zimbabwe. SUBJECTS--118 women with an uncomplicated twin pregnancy between 28 and 30 weeks gestation. INTERVENTION--Hospitalization for bed rest. Encouraged to rest in bed as much as possible, although voluntary ambulation was allowed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Gestational age at delivery and number of infants delivered preterm (less than 37 weeks); birthweight and number of small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants; neonatal morbidity was assessed by number of infants requiring admission to the neonatal unit and the length of stay. RESULTS--There was no effect on duration of gestation or the occurrence of preterm delivery. Mean birthweight was greater in the hospitalized group (t = -2.28, df 234, P = 0.02) and there were fewer SGA infants (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.96). No differences were found in neonatal morbidity. CONCLUSIONS--Hospitalization for bed rest does not prolong pregnancy but can improve fetal growth, although this was not reflected in improved neonatal morbidity. Whether twin fetal growth can be enhanced similarly in other populations should be investigated.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare maternal mortalities attributable to vaginal delivery, elective caesarean section (CS) and intrapartum CS. DESIGN--The number of deaths associated with each method of delivery was ascertained among unselected and among low-risk women by detailed retrospective review of the case-notes of women who died after delivery. The frequency of each method of delivery throughout the study period was ascertained from the computer database and enhanced by analysis of the case-notes of unselected groups of women. SETTING--The Peninsula Maternity Services (Cape Town) during the years 1975-1986 inclusive. SUBJECTS--A total of 108 maternal deaths arising from 263,075 maternities provided accurate information. The relative frequency of vaginal and abdominal delivery was determined from the computer database. The ratio of elective CS to emergency prepartum CS to intrapartum CS was obtained by review of the first 200 operations in the years 1975, 1977, 1979, 1982 and 1984. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--(i) Mortality rates associated with the different methods of delivery in unselected women and in women who were healthy before surgery; (ii) mortality rates apparently attributable to the method of delivery. RESULTS--The overall relative risk of mortality associated with caesarean section compared with vaginal delivery was 7 decreasing to 5 after the exclusion of women with medical or life-threatening antenatal complications (eg, haemorrhage, hypertension). The relative risk associated with intrapartum compared with elective sections was 2.3 decreasing to 1.4 after the exclusion of women with medical disorders or life-threatening complications. The relative risk of maternal mortality which was apparently attributable to intrapartum compared with elective sections was 1.7. However, the 95% confidence intervals of these values, even from this large data-set, are wide. Nevertheless, these rates are in broad agreement with an approximation derived from the British confidential enquiries into maternal deaths. CONCLUSION--The attributable relative mortalities of caesarean section compared with vaginal delivery and intrapartum compared with elective caesarean section are lower than the overall relative mortalities of these modes of delivery and are approximately 5:1 and 1.5:1 respectively. These data are crucially important in the decision to recommend elective caesarean section compared with trial of labour.\r"

SETTING--Hospital department of obstetrics and gynaecology, referral centre. PATIENTS--41 pregnancies in 38 women were randomized. The results of 13 pregnancies were considered non-assessable. The final analysis involved 14 in the betamethasone group and 14 in the non-treatment group. All fulfilled the criteria for ITP. INTERVENTIONS--The treated group received 1.5 mg betamethasone orally per day, from day 259 till day 273 and 1 mg from day 273 till delivery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Effects of treatment were assessed in terms of maternal platelet counts after the first trimester and neonatal platelet counts at birth and the first week of life and neonatal bleeding episodes. RESULTS--There were no significant differences in neonatal platelet counts at birth. Two infants in the betamethasone group and one in the untreated group had a severe thrombocytopenia either at birth or during the first week of life (less than 50 x 10(9)/l). Seven infants in the betamethasone group and six in the non-treatment group had a mild thrombocytopenia. The overall frequency of neonatal thrombocytopenia was similar: 64% in the betamethasone group and 57% in the untreated group (95% CI of the true difference: -43.5% to +29.5%). There was also no significant difference in neonatal bleeding episodes. CONCLUSIONS--Low-dose betamethasone in pregnant women with ITP does not prevent thrombocytopenia or bleeding in their newborn infants.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare routine versus highly selective use of Doppler ultrasound and biophysical scoring in higher risk pregnancy. DESIGN--A pragmatic randomized trial. SETTING--St James's University Hospital, Leeds. SUBJECTS--500 pregnant women at high risk of intrauterine growth retardation or still birth. INTERVENTIONS--Regular monitoring with biophysical profile assessment and Doppler velocity waveform recording in umbilical and uteroplacental arteries. Results immediately available to clinicians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Gestational age at delivery, obstetric intervention rates and short-term neonatal morbidity. RESULTS--Risk factors were distributed very evenly between the 250 patients in the study and control groups respectively. A total of 902 biophysical profile and Doppler assessments were done in the 250 study group patients and only in 12 patients in the control group. In the study group, absent end-diastolic flow was found in only 2.7% of all 902 measurements. A persistently abnormal biophysical score was always associated with absence of end-diastolic flow. The mean gestational age at induction of labour was statistically and clinically similar in the two groups and there was no overall statistically significant difference in intervention rates between the two groups. There was a statistically significant lower frequency of depressed 5-min Apgar scores in the study group. Serious neonatal morbidity was also statistically significantly more common in the control group than in the study group. CONCLUSIONS--The use of Doppler ultrasound in higher risk pregnancies does not lead to an increase in iatrogenic preterm delivery. The total rate of positive tests on Doppler ultrasound is very low and persistently abnormal biophysical scores are unlikely to be found in patients where umbilical end-diastolic blood flow is present. Surrogate measures for fetal damage seem to be improved when clinicians have access to Doppler ultrasound assessments.\r"

Of these 38 women with supraphysiological oestradiol levels 23 had started therapy for menopausal symptoms and 15 for the premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Of the 23 women treated for menopausal symptoms 11 had a history of psychiatric referral for depression and nine had undergone a surgical menopause. Nine of the 15 women with PMS had a history of psychiatric referral for depressive symptoms. We conclude that the women who attain supraphysiological levels of oestradiol on implant therapy have a high frequency of psychopathology or surgical menopause and may require higher oestradiol levels for adequate control of symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "Age, ultrasound score, menopausal status, a clinical impression score and serum CA 125 level were assessed to see how they could best distinguish between patients with benign (n = 101) and malignant (n = 42) pelvic masses. Each criteria used alone provided statistically significant discrimination. The most useful individual criteria were a serum CA 125 level of 30 U/ml (sensitivity 81%, specificity 75%) and an ultrasound score of 2 (sensitivity 71%, specificity 83%). Three criteria could be combined in a risk of malignancy index (RMI) which is simply calculated using the product of the serum CA 125 level (U/ml), the ultrasound scan result (expressed as a score of 0, 1 or 3) and the menopausal status (1 if premenopausal and 3 if postmenopausal). This index was statistically virtually as effective a discriminant between cancer and benign lesions as more formal methods. Using an RMI cut-off level of 200, the sensitivity was 85% and the specificity was 97%. Patients with an RMI score of greater than 200 had, on average, 42 times the background risk of cancer and those with a lower value 0.15 times the background risk.\r"

  ".W": "Serum concentrations of CA 125 were measured in different phases of the menstrual cycle in 16 women with ovulatory and 12 women with anovulatory cycles. CA 125 levels were significantly elevated during menstruation in both groups. In women with anovulatory cycles, but not in those with ovulatory cycles, CA 125 levels were already increased in the premenstrual phase. A negative correlation was found between serum CA 125 and progesterone concentrations in the premenstrual phase of the cycle. We suggest that premenstrual elevation of serum CA 125 in women with anovulatory cycles is related to premature endometrial vascular changes which are the result of the low serum progesterone concentration leading to insufficient endometrial control. Thus the effect of progesterone seems to be indirect rather than a direct effect on CA 125 synthesis. When the CA 125 assay is used for diagnosis of cancer, sampling should not be done immediately before or during menstruation because the physiological elevation of the CA 125 levels may give false positive results.\r"

We measured serum CA 125 levels longitudinally in three different groups of patients who had normal serum CA 125 levels (less than or equal to 16 U/ml) before extensive intraperitoneal abdominal surgery (group 1, second-look laparotomy in 28 women with ovarian cancer; group 2, radical hysterectomy in 42 patients with cervical cancer; group 3, 13 men and one woman who had aortic surgery for atherosclerotic occlusive disease or aneurysm formation). Following surgery, rising serum CA 125 levels were observed in 69 out of the 84 patients (82%), irrespective of the primary diagnosis, type of operation or sex. The highest levels were found during the second week after the operation (range 3-336 U/ml) and decreased gradually thereafter, to become normal at 8 weeks after surgery. It was concluded that abdominal surgery interferes with the specificity of CA 125 as a tumour marker during the early postoperative period.\r"

Highly significant differences between the lenses of the diabetic subjects and non-diabetic controls were found.

Loss of cell contents resulted in the formation of plicae on the surface of many cells. Two types of inclusion bodies were detected in the epithelial cells. The first type, intranuclear vacuolar inclusions, contained homogeneous material. The second type of inclusions were round, dense bodies, that developed in the homogeneous material of intranuclear vacuolar inclusions. The dense bodies contained the replicating and maturing virus particles. After cell degeneration the dense bodies become extracellular. Making a corneal replica had a beneficial effect on the clinical course of adenovirus keratitis.\r"

These points bear similarities to the results of pattern electroretinograms (PERG) in amblyopes, and the possibility of the causative defect being at ganglion cell level is discussed. The effect of occlusion treatment cannot be predicted from the presence or absence of a RAPD.\r"

The complexity of this problem is related to the hemostatic process, the technical variations in the operative procedures, and the many uncontrolled variables associated with CPB, including the effects of anesthetic or pharmacologic agents, the nature of the priming solution, hemodilution, hypothermia, the type of oxygenator, and the use of transfused blood products. Although there are multiple and generally predictable complex changes in the hemostatic mechanism during CPB, the temporary loss of platelet function is the most common and clinically relevant. This transient platelet dysfunction occurs in all patients undergoing CPB; however, it only causes excessive bleeding in a small percentage of patients. Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to predict which patients will develop hemorrhagic complications, although prolonged pump times are a contributing risk factor. Over the past decade there has been extensive investigation into the management of bleeding associated with CPB, provoked primarily by the increased awareness of transfusion-transmitted viral diseases and the inappropriately excessive use of homologous blood products. Several approaches to autotransfusion of shed blood and autologus blood donation have been developed to minimize perioperative homologous blood transfusion. Pharmacologic agents such as desmopressin, aprotinin, and topical fibrin glues have also been introduced to improve hemostasis during CPB. The protease inhibitor aprotinin is particularly promising in the reduction of bleeding associated with CPB when given prophylactically. Aprotinin may provide new insights into the mechanism of CPB-induced platelet dysfunction. Desmopressin is indicated only for the treatment of bleeding after CPB. The management of bleeding associated with CPB will undoubtedly\r"

In the present studies, flow cytometry was used to distinguish differences in the reactivity of Naka+ and Naka- platelets with both OKM5, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope on GPIV, and with polyclonal anti-GPIV antibody. OKM5 was also used to screen 871 platelet concentrates prepared from healthy US blood donors. Three of these showed markedly deficient binding of 125I-OKM5 or an incidence of 0.34%. Two of these donors were re-accessed and showed less than 1% binding of 125I-OKM5 as compared with 10,300 +/- 1,500 binding sites per platelet in controls (n = 4). Platelets from these two US donors were radiolabeled (125I, 3H) and compared with control platelets and with platelets from Japanese Naka+ and Naka- donors by crossed immunoelectrophoresis, protein blots, immunoprecipitation, and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. GPIV could not be detected by any of these techniques in the Naka- platelets nor in the donors whose platelets showed deficient binding of OKM5. These results suggest that GPIV functions as an isoantigen rather than an alloantigen in immunizing Naka- platelet recipients. This is the first report of the absence of a major platelet membrane GP in healthy blood donors.\r"

Of the 22, four patients were previously untreated, two were resistant after conventional chemotherapy, and 16 were in first (n = 11), second (n = 4), or third (n = 1) relapse. We observed 14 complete response, four transient responses, one failure, and three early deaths. Length of hospitalization and number of transfusions were notably reduced in complete responders. Correction of coagulation disorders and an increase of WBCs were the first signs of all-trans RA efficacy. Morphologic analysis performed at days 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 showed that complete remissions were obtained without bone marrow (BM) hypoplasia. Presence of Auer rods in the maturing cells confirmed the differentiation effect of the treatment. At remission, the t(15;17) initially present in 20 patients was not found. The in vitro studies showed a differentiation in the presence of all-trans RA in 16 of the 18 tested cases. The single nonresponder to all trans RA in vitro did not respond in vivo. Adverse effects of RA therapy--skin and mucosa dryness, hypertriglyceridemia, and increase of hepatic transaminases--were frequently noted. We also observed bone pain in 11 patients and hyperleukocytosis in four patients. Whether maintenance treatment consisted of low-dose chemotherapy or all-trans RA, early relapses were observed. Five patients are still in complete remission (CR) at 4 to 13 months. Our study confirms the major efficacy of all-trans RA in M3, even in relapsing patients. Remissions are obtained by a differentiation process.\r"

Both isomers induce maximal differentiation at 10(-6) mol/L. The maximal response was maintained at 10(-7) mol/L for the all-trans but not for the 13-cis RA.

  ".W": "Fourteen patients with high-risk T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in complete remission underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in an attempt to eradicate their residual disease burden. A combined immunochemotherapy protocol using a cocktail of two immunotoxins directed against CD5/Tp67 and CD7/Tp41 T-lineage differentiation antigens in combination with the in vitro active cyclophosphamide congener 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (4-HC) was used to purge autografts. Despite high dose pretransplant radiochemotherapy and effective purging of autografts, 9 of 14 patients relapsed at a median of 2.5 months (range, 1.2 to 16.8 months) post BMT. Two patients remain alive and disease free at 26 and 28 months post BMT. We used a novel quantitative minimal residual disease (MRD) detection assay, which combines fluorescence activated multiparameter flow cytometry and cell sorting with leukemic progenitor cell (LPC) assays, to analyze remission bone marrow (BM) samples from T-lineage ALL patients for the presence of residual LPCs. Notably, high numbers of residual LPC detected in remission BM before BMT constituted a poor prognostic indicator, providing the first evidence for the biologic significance and clinical value of in vitro T-lineage ALL LPC assays. The median value for the residual leukemia burden before BMT, was approximately 8.6 x 10(3) LPC/10(8) mononuclear cells (MNC) (approximately 0.0086% LPC). Patients with a residual leukemia burden less than this median value appeared to have a better outlook for remaining free of relapse after autologous BMT than patients with a greater leukemia burden (53 +/- 25% v 14 +/- 13%, P = .006, Mantel-Cox). By comparison, the log kill efficacy of purging, the remaining numbers of LPC in purged autografts, or the estimated numbers of reinfused LPC, did not correlate with the probability of disease-free survival (DFS). These results indicate that the primary reason for the recurrence of leukemia was inefficient pretransplant radiochemotherapy rather than inefficient purging of autografts.\r"

The present study was designed to investigate whether human basophils express IL-4 binding sites. For this purpose, basophils were enriched to homogeneity (93% and 98% purity, respectively) from the peripheral blood of two chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) donors using a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and complement. Purified basophils bound 125I-radiolabeled recombinant human (rh) IL-4 in a specific manner. Quantitative binding studies and Scatchard plot analysis revealed the presence of a single class of high affinity IL-4 binding sites (280 +/- 40 sites per cell in donor 1 and 640 +/- 45 sites per cell in donor 2) with an apparent dissociation constant, kd, of 7.12 x 10(-11) +/- 2.29 x 10(-11) and 9.55 +/- 3.5 x 10(-11) mol/L, respectively.

No change in the numbers or binding constants of IL-4 receptors was found after exposure of KU812-F cells to rhIL-3 (a potent activator of basophils) for 60 minutes. No effect of rhIL-4 on 3H-thymidine uptake, release or synthesis of histamine, or expression of basophil differentiation antigens (Bsp-1, CD11b, CD25, CD40, CD54) on primary human CGL basophils or KU812-F cells was observed.\r"

  ".W": "The low frequency of plasma cells and the lack of specific cell surface markers has been a major obstacle for a detailed characterization of plasma cells in normal human bone marrow. Multiparameter flow cytometry enabled the identification of plasma cells in normal bone marrow aspirates. The plasma cells were located in a unique position in the correlation of forward light scattering, orthogonal light scattering, and immunofluorescent-labeled CD38. The identity of the sorted cell populations was confirmed by microscopic examination of Wright's stained slides and slides stained for cytoplasmic immunoglobulin using polyclonal antibodies reactive with light chains; ie, anti-kappa fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti lambda phycoerythrin (PE). The purity of the sorted plasma cells was greater than 97% (n = 4). The average frequency of plasma cells in normal bone marrow aspirates was low--0.25% of the nucleated cells (n = 7)--but surprisingly consistent between individuals (SD = .05; range 0.14% to 0.30%). A detailed analysis showed two distinct populations of plasma cells: (1) A population relatively smaller by forward light scattering expressed CD22, CD35, and sigE and was identified as early plasma cells (ie, lymphoplasmacytoid), and (2) a population larger by forward light scattering lacked these markers and was identified as mature plasma cells. The antigenic profile of the normal plasma cells was determined in two-color immunofluorescence studies. The expression of cell surface immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, IgE, IgD, IgM, and the cell surface antigens CD10, CD11b, CD13, CD11c, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD19, CD22, CD20, CD33, CD35, CD45, and HLA-DR was determined on the plasma cells. A significant heterogeneity in cell surface antigen expression was observed within the plasma cell population. Unexpectedly, myeloid-specific cell surface antigens such as CD33 and CD13 and the early B-cell antigen identified by CD10 were expressed on a proportion of plasma cells. These observations imply that the association of myeloid and early B-cell markers described in multiple myeloma may not be associated with the neoplasia but is a normal phenomenon.\r"

  ".U": "91028236\r", 
  ".W": "Thirty-two patients with aplastic anemia (AA) have been studied using the long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) system. Of these patients, 26 had been treated with immunosuppressive therapy including antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) with or without androgens or high-dose methyl prednisolone. The remaining six patients either required no treatment or were studied before therapy was begun. Thirty-one of 32 patients (96%) had defective hematopoiesis in LTBMC with little or no evidence for the generation of primitive progenitor cells. The only exception was a patient with spontaneous recovery of aplasia in whom the defect was less marked. Crossover LTBMC experiments were performed in 23 cases by inoculating (1) patient marrow hematopoietic cells that had been depleted of adherent cells onto preformed, irradiated, normal stromas to assess the proliferative capacity of the hematopoietic cells, and (2) normal marrow hematopoietic cells that were depleted of adherent cells onto preformed, irradiated stromas from patients with AA to assess stromal function. Results of these experiments demonstrated a hematopoietic defect in all patients that was independent of the degree of hematologic recovery after ALG therapy. Only one patient had a probable stromal defect and this coexisted with a defect in the regenerative capacity of hematopoietic cells. We conclude that LTBMC is a sensitive method for detecting and defining the hematopoietic failure in AA. We suggest that the defective hematopoiesis present in all patients studied may be important in the pathogenesis of clonal evolution in AA.\r"

  ".U": "91028237\r", 
  ".W": "Hemonectin (HN), a component of the bone marrow (BM) extracellular matrix which promotes adhesion of cells in the granulocytic lineage, was purified to near homogeneity and tested for its ability to mediate attachment of normal and leukemic cells of granulocytic lineage. Purified HN immobilized on plastic substrates promoted serum-free attachment of normal granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells (CFC-GM), using an in situ attachment assay in which cell attachment is inhibited by specific polyclonal antisera. When unfractionated BM cells were allowed to attach to purified HN and stained in situ, HN preferentially bound cells at earlier stages of granulocytic differentiation. These observations were confirmed using cells of the HL-60 progranulocytic cell line which mirrored this differentiation-stage specific binding to HN. HN promoted attachment of 60% of uninduced HL-60 cells which were arrested at the progranulocyte stage, whereas only 15% of uninduced HL-60 cells attached to uncoated plastic and 4% to attached plastic coated with equal microgram quantities of bovine serum albumin (BSA). When HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway by incubation with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), attachment to hemonectin was reduced. Thus, both primary BM granulocytic cells and a granulocytic cell line show preferential attachment of those cells at earlier stages of differentiation. This developmentally regulated binding suggests a mechanism for release of maturing BM into the peripheral circulation.\r"

  ".W": "The hematopoietic cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is being used in clinical trials for its potential in the treatment of hematopoietic insufficiency due to various causes. Involvement of leukotrienes in the effects of GM-CSF is suggested by analytical and pharmacologic evidence obtained in vitro. However, until now no data in support of a role of leukotrienes in GM-CSF action in vivo have been presented. In the present investigation this question was approached by measurement of endogenous cysteinyl leukotriene formation in patients treated with the cytokine for cytopenia induced by cytostatic drugs or for refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB). Endogenous cysteinyl leukotriene formation was assessed by determination of urinary leukotriene metabolites using combined high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay analysis. After GM-CSF administration a distinct increase in urinary cysteinyl leukotrienes was found in the cytopenic and the RAEB patients that ranged from 2.3- to 57-fold and 2.4- to 333-fold, respectively. In the cytopenic patients the increase in leukotriene production was correlated to an expansion of peripheral blood leukocytes; RAEB patients responded to GM-CSF with enhanced leukotriene biosynthesis even if the peripheral leukocytes decreased, possibly due to an abnormal number and/or irritability of leukotriene-producing cells. The increase in endogenous leukotriene production during therapy with GM-CSF may indicate that leukotrienes play a role in GM-CSF action in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Investigations linking human megakaryocyte development and cell biology have been hindered by an inability to obtain large, relatively pure megakaryocyte cell preparations from in vitro stem cell cultures. We report here that such preparations can be generated from liquid cultures of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by a serum source of megakaryocyte colony stimulating activity (Meg-CSA, the 0% to 60% ammonium sulfate protein fraction of aplastic canine serum). Adherent-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells are suspended at 5 x 10(5) to 10(6) cells/mL in supplemented liquid culture medium, platelet-poor human plasma 20% (vol/vol) and 1 to 2 mg/mL serum Meg-CSA protein. After 12 to 14 days of incubation, megakaryocytes constitute 3.0 +/- 2.9% (mean +/- SD, n = 8) of the unseparated cultured cell population. Megakaryocytes can be enriched by counterflow centrifugal elutriation to a purity of 58 +/- 14% (+/- SD) with a recovery of 13 +/- 7% and a viability of 67 +/- 19%. This algorithm results in the average isolation of approximately 3 x 10(5) enriched megakaryocytes from a 100-mL starting volume of peripheral blood. Cultured megakaryocytes exhibit normal light and ultrastructural morphology by Wright-Giemsa staining and electron microscopic analysis. After a 12-day culture interval, enriched megakaryocyte preparations exhibit morphologic stage distributions that are similar to normal human marrow. Stage distributions move rightward with culture duration indicating partial synchrony of megakaryocyte maturation. On cytospin preparations, megakaryocyte diameter averages 30.2 +/- 1.5 microns and increases with maturation stage. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrate the expression of platelet glycoproteins (GP) Ib and IIb/IIIa by the cultured megakaryocytes. The modal ploidy of the enriched cells at day 12 of culture is 16N and most remaining megakaryocytes are 8N or 32N. Liquid culture of serum Meg-CSA-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells represents a valuable investigative tool that should permit studies of human megakaryocyte biology that have not been possible in the past.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) has well-known effects on murine bone marrow, but its colony stimulating activity for human bone marrow is controversial. After treatment of human bone marrow with L-phenylalanine methylester (PME), macrophage-colonies (CFU-M) were induced by M-CSF in a dose-dependent fashion. The optimal concentration of recombinant human-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhM-CSF) was 1,000 U/mL. Purified human urine M-CSF had colony stimulating activity similar to rhM-CSF. Further studies were performed to determine the factors responsible for the enhanced CFU-M formation from PME treated marrow. Compared with nylon wool and carbonyl iron monocyte depletion methods, PME eliminated significantly more monocytes and myeloid cells. This observation suggested that these cells may release hematopoietic inhibitory factors for CFU-M. Low concentrations (1%) but not normal (10%) concentrations of blood monocytes were inhibitory (mean inhibition, 48%) to CFU-M. High concentrations of monocytes (50%) augmented CFU-M colonies. HL-60 conditioned media was used to simulate secretory products of early myeloid cells. HL-60 conditioned media (1%) inhibited CFU-M formation but not granulocyte macrophage or granulocyte colonies. We conclude that M-CSF has colony stimulating activity for human marrow that can be recognized after removal of inhibitory cells by PME treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Single-pulse administration of rhG-colony-stimulating factor (CSF) to neonatal rats was previously demonstrated to induce peripheral neutrophilia and modulate bone marrow (BM) neutrophil storage and proliferative pools (NSP + NPP). In this study, we investigated the prolonged effects of 7 days of rhG-CSF therapy (5 micrograms/kg/per day). Sprague-Dawley newborn rats (less than or equal to 24 hours) were injected intraperitoneally (IP) (daily for 7 days) with rhG-CSF or phosphate-buffered saline/human serum albumin (PBS/HSA). RhG-CSF induced a significant early and late peripheral neutrophilia: 6,905 +/- 1,625 (day 1) and 9,223 +/- 515 microL (day 7) v 1,275 +/- 90/microL (P less than or equal to .0001). In addition, 7 days of rhG-CSF resulted in a significant increase in the BM NSP: 3,247 +/- 190/microL v 1,677 +/- 339/microL (P less than or equal to .001). There was, however, no depletion or significant change in the BM NPP. Seven days of rhG-CSF also induced a mild increase in BM CFU-GM colony formation (P less than or equal to .01). There was, however, no significant change in liver/spleen CFU-GM colonies or in the CFU-GM proliferative rate in either the BM or liver/spleen cultures. Finally, 7 days of prophylactic rhG-CSF therapy resulted in a synergistic response with antibiotic therapy and significantly modulated the mortality rate during experimental group B streptococcal sepsis (GBS) (100% v 50%) (GvsC) (P less than or equal to .001). Pulse rhG-CSF administered at 6 hours or 18 hours after GBS inoculation, however, failed to act synergistically with antibiotics to improve survival or prevent peripheral neutropenia. This study suggests that 7 days of prophylactic rhG-CSF therapy induces peripheral neutrophilia, myeloid maturation, increases neutrophil BM reserves and also may provide immunologic enhancement of neonatal host defense during experimental GBS in term neonatal rats.\r"

  ".W": "Human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture (HUVEC) express receptors for urokinase-type plasminogen activators (u-PA). The immunochemical nature of this receptor and its relationship to u-PA receptors expressed by other cell types is unknown. Cross-linking active site-blocked u-PA to HUVEC lead to an increase in its apparent molecular mass by approximately 40 Kd. The predominant u-PA binding protein isolated from whole cell detergent extracts migrated with a molecular mass of approximately 36 Kd using affinity chromatography. In contrast, when only cell surface proteins were radiolabeled before extraction, the predominant labeled u-PA binding protein isolated migrated with a molecular mass of approximately 46 Kd. Several pieces of evidence suggested that the difference in molecular mass between these two u-PA binding proteins resulted from glycosylation of a single receptor protein. First, a polyclonal antibody against u-PA receptor isolated from phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated U-937 cells reacted with both the 36- and 46-Kd proteins on Western blotting. Second, the size of the unmodified receptor was estimated by amplifying a full-length cDNA for u-PA receptor from an endothelial cell cDNA library using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the DNA sequence of the receptor cloned from transformed human fibroblasts (Roldan et al, EMBO J 9:467, 1990). The size of the cDNA (approximately 1,054 base pairs, bp) and the presence of a single 1.4-kilobase (Kb) mRNA transcript on Northern blot analysis predict an unglycosylated receptor protein of approximately 35 Kd. Third, synthesis of 35S-labeled 46-Kd cell surface receptor protein was inhibited when the cells were grown in the presence of tunicamycin, while the synthesis of the 36-Kd species was unaffected. Moreover, the apparent molecular mass of purified surface-labeled receptor (approximately 46 Kd) was reduced by N-glycanase. These studies suggest that the u-PA receptor on the surface of HUVEC is a glycoprotein derived from a protein of approximately 35 Kd which is similar immunologically to u-PA receptors on other cell types.\r"

Conventional methods of diagnosing central nervous system (CNS) leukemia rely on the interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell morphology, which may produce ambiguous results in the presence of minimal leukemic involvement. A methodology has been developed for immunophenotyping small numbers of CSF cells while preserving cell morphology. CSF samples from 33 children with CD10 (common ALL antigen [CALLA]) positive ALL were examined at initial presentation using both conventional morphology and this combined immunohistopathologic technique. Six (18%) of the samples contained lymphoblasts or cells considered morphologically suspicious for leukemic involvement. Nine additional samples (27% of the total) had normal CSF morphology, but contained increased numbers of CALLA positive cells. Twelve of the 33 samples were also examined for the simultaneous presence of nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and demonstrated increased numbers of cells positive for both TdT and CD10. These data suggest that a large proportion of children with ALL may have abnormalities of CSF cells at initial diagnosis consistent with the presence of occult leukemic involvement.\r"

M-BCR was rearranged and chromosome in situ hybridization showed an ABL insertion between 5' and 3' M-BCR on an apparently normal chromosome 22. The association of 5' BCR and 3' ABL at the 5' junction of the chromosome 9 insert was typical of that found for the BCR-ABL fusion gene in other patients with the standard t(9;22) and CML. With an M-bcr-3' probe, we cloned and characterized a 3' junction fragment. Field inversion gel electrophoresis and chromosome in situ hybridization studies using a probe isolated from genomic DNA 5' of the junction showed that 3' M-BCR was joined to a region of chromosome 9q34 rich in repetitive sequences and lying some distance 3' of ABL. The chromosome 9 insert was at least 329 kilobases long and included 3' ABL and a larger portion of chromosome 9q34. Our results allowed us to exclude transposon- or retroviral-mediated insertion of ABL into chromosome 22. Instead, we favored a two-translocation model in which a second translocation reconstituted a standard t(9;22)(q34;q11) but left the chromosome 9 insert, including 3' ABL, in chromosome 22.\r"

The new hybrid mRNA is 540 base pairs (bp) longer than that expressed by the K562 cell line and could codify for a Bcr/Abl protein carrying 180 additional aminoacids with respect to the larger P210 protein so far identified.

Ten of 40 (25%) cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) reacted with at least one of the 29 anti-SId MoAbs. Three cases reacted with more than one anti-SId MoAb, but there was no repetitive pattern of a single anti-SId MoAb reacting with a large proportion of CLL cases. In contrast, for B-cell lymphoma, in which 11 of 31 (36%) cases reacted, one anti-SId (B4-1) reacted with five of the positive cases; all were diffuse histology. Restricted anti-SId reactivity may lead to important insights into the etiology of certain B-cell lymphomas.

Stimulation of human neutrophils with a combination of chemotactic factor (formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, FMLP) and phagocytosable particles (opsonized zymosan) resulted in little production of LTC4 alone, but measurable quantities appeared when platelets were coincubated. When these agonists were added to platelets alone in the absence of neutrophils, no LTC4 was produced. In the presence of stimulated neutrophils, the final synthesis of LTC4 was shown to occur within the platelets (from neutrophil-derived LTA4) by experiments using platelets that had been prelabeled with 35S-cysteine to label intracellular platelet glutathione. Other 35S-labeled sulfidopeptide leukotriene metabolites were also produced in this coincubation of neutrophils and platelets. The observed synergy between FMLP and opsonized zymosan in the production of LTC4 when neutrophils and platelets were coincubated may involve priming the neutrophil for LTA4 production. Activation of platelets or endothelial cells with thrombin did not alter the capacity of either cell to convert exogenously added LTA4 into LTC4. This would support the suggestion that even when platelets are activated they retain their capacity to metabolize LTA4 into LTC4. Finally, previous exposure of the platelets to LTA4 did not affect subsequent metabolism of arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenase pathway to thromboxane A2 (TXA2) except at very high concentration of LTA4. These results suggest that cell-cell interactions may be critical determinants of the profile of eicosanoids produced in physiologic and pathophysiologic circumstances. In particular, we believe that both endothelial cells and platelets can, together with neutrophils, contribute relatively large amounts of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes to inflammatory and thrombotic events. These cell-cell interactions are aspirin-insensitive; therefore, aspirin-treated platelets are capable of synthesizing the vasoconstrictor LTC4 from neutrophil LTA4 at a time when they can no longer produce thromboxane.\r"

  ".W": "To understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to sequestration of red blood cells infected with mature stages of Plasmodium falciparum and to examine the relevance of earlier studies on adherence properties of laboratory-derived P falciparum parasites to the natural parasite population, we analyzed Gambian and Tanzanian isolates for in vitro cytoadherence and antibody-mediated microagglutination. Eighteen cryopreserved isolates of ring-stage parasites were cultured for 20 to 30 hours in vitro, in the patients original erythrocytes, to the trophozoite and schizont stage. All parasites were positive in the microagglutination assay with at least one of four African hyperimmune sera. In a rosetting assay, only 2 of the 18 isolates were strongly positive (35% and 41% of parasitized erythrocytes with more than two uninfected cells bound). Thirteen isolates showed either intermediate (5% to 18%) or low (less than 5%) rosetting while three isolates did not form rosettes. Infected cell-binding of the different isolates to immobilized CD36 or thrombospondin, or C32 melanoma cells correlated with the percentage of mature parasites in the blood samples (r = .932 for CD36, r = .946 for thrombospondin, and r = .881 for C32 melanoma cells). There was a high correlation between binding to CD36 and thrombospondin (r = .982). The extent of infected cell rosetting with uninfected cells in these blood samples was not correlated with these other receptor properties. We also observed coexpression of rosetting and cytoadherence receptors on the same parasitized erythrocytes.\r"

  ".U": "91028250\r", 
  ".W": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a disease that affects not only red cells, but other blood cells as well. The common defect is supposed to be an acquired deficiency of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane proteins, which may be present already at the hematopoietic stem cell level. Recently, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) has become available directed against various GPI-linked membrane proteins. This makes it possible to study various cell lineages for the deficiency of such proteins in PNH in more detail. Using cytofluorography, we could show that the granulocytes of 20 different PNH patients miss not only GPI-linked FcRIII (CD16 antigen), but also three other GPI-linked proteins, ie, CD24 antigen, CD67 antigen and a granulocyte-specific 50 to 80 Kd antigen. The affected granulocytes were not only neutrophils but also eosinophils, as was found in a more detailed analysis of three patients. Moreover, in all 10 PNH patients tested, the monocytes were found to be deficient for the GPI-linked CD14 antigen, and we found with CD24 and CD55 (DAF) antibodies that lymphocytes may be involved as well. However, abnormal B and T lymphocytes were detected only in a subset of patients (2 of 10 tested). The uniform deficiency of GPI-linked proteins of granulocytes allows the introduction of a new diagnostic cytofluorometric assay for PNH with MoAbs against GPI-linked granulocytic antigens. This test was positive in all PNH patients studied and not in a group of 40 control patients or 50 normal donors, with the exception of three of 16 aplastic anemia (AA) patients. In the three AA patients, subpopulations (10% to 20%) of PNH granulocytes could be detected, whereas these patients had a negative acidified serum (Ham) test. This indicates that the new test is more sensitive than the Ham test and allows the early diagnosis of PNH in AA. An advantage of the neutrophil assay is that, in contrast to the Ham test, it is not influenced by recent red-cell transfusions. Moreover, it is possible to quantify the number of affected cells by single cell analysis.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple myeloma remains a universally fatal malignancy with a median survival time not exceeding 3 years. A clinical trial was undertaken to determine feasibility and efficacy of marrow-ablative chemoradiotherapy supported by unpurged autologous bone marrow (ABMT) and to define prognostic variables. Total body irradiation and either melphalan or thiotepa were administered to 55 patients (median age 53 years; range 20 to 66 years). The group of 21 patients with resistance to standard melphalan-prednisone and to continuous infusions of vincristine and Adriamycin with high dose dexamethasone (VAD) included 7 with primary unresponsive disease and 14 with resistant relapse; among the 34 patients achieving remission with the VAD regimen, 14 were in first and 20 in a subsequent remission. Marked cytoreduction by greater than or equal to 75% was observed among all 21 patients with refractory myeloma, whereas further cytoreduction of this magnitude was noted in only 56% of the 34 patients already in remission after VAD. Five of the 6 early deaths among all 55 patients occurred in the 14 patients with resistant relapse, none of whom achieved complete remission and who, as a group, had median durations of relapse-free and overall survival of only 8 and 7 months, respectively. Among the 41 remaining patients, there was only one early death, and 27% achieved complete remission including a 36% incidence among the 14 patients treated in first remission; their projected 4-year survival rate was 82% regardless of their disease status (first or later remission or primary resistance). When information about sensitivity to prior therapy is unavailable, the presence before ABMT of both high beta-2-microglobulin levels (greater than 3 mg/L) and non-IgG isotype helped identify 9 among the 55 patients with a very poor prognosis: all 8 responders relapsed within 9 months, and 8 patients died within 15 months. By contrast, a 4-year projected survival rate of over 70% for the other patients (about 80% of this series) justifies further investigation of this novel treatment approach in comparison with standard dose regimens. Our results indicate that marrow-ablative therapy cannot be recommended for myeloma patients with resistant relapse or those with a combination of risk factors (advanced tumor burden, absence of IgG isotype). The apparent lack of an adverse effect of even marked plasmacytosis in autografts (up to 30%) emphasizes the need for better cytoreduction rather than bone marrow purging.\r"

All patients received 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide followed by TBI and marrow from HLA-identical siblings. Cyclosporine and methotrexate were used for prophylaxis against acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thirty-four patients received 2.0-Gy fractions of irradiation daily for 6 days and 37 received 2.25-Gy fractions daily for 7 days. The 3-year actuarial probabilities for relapse-free survival were 0.58 for the patients who received 12.0 Gy and 0.59 for those who received 15.75 Gy. The 3-year probabilities of relapse were 0.35 for the 12.0 Gy group and 0.12 for the 15.75 Gy group (P = .06). The 3-year probabilities of transplant-related mortality were 0.12 and 0.32, respectively (P = .04). The probability of moderate to severe acute GVHD was 0.21 for the 12.0 Gy group and 0.48 for the 15.75 Gy group (P = .02). Patients exposed to the higher irradiation dose received less immunoprophylaxis against, and had a higher incidence of, acute GVHD. The increased dose of TBI significantly reduced the probability of relapse but did not improve survival because of increased mortality from causes other than relapse.\r"

  ".W": "Three radiation protocols currently used in treatment of leukemia patients before bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were investigated in a murine model (C57BL/6----C3H/HeJ) for BM allograft rejection. These include (a) a single dose of total body irradiation (8.5 Gy TBI delivered at a dose rate of 0.2 Gy/min), (b) fractionated TBI (12 Gy administered in six fractions, 2 Gy twice a day in 3 days, delivered at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min, and (c) hyperfractionated TBI (14.4 Gy administered in 12 fractions, 1.2 Gy three times a day in 3 days, delivered at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min). Donor-type chimerism 6 to 8 weeks after BMT and hematologic reconstitution on day 12 after BMT found in these groups were compared with results obtained in mice conditioned with 8 Gy TBI delivered at a dose rate of 0.67 Gy/min, routinely used in this murine model. The results in both parameters showed a marked advantage for the single dose 8.5 Gy TBI over all the other treatments. This advantage was found to be equivalent to three- to fourfold increment in the BM inoculum when compared with hyperfractionated radiation, which afforded the least favorable conditions for development of donor-type chimerism. The fractionated radiation protocol was equivalent in its efficacy to results obtained in mice irradiated by single-dose 8 Gy TBI, both of which afforded a smaller but not significant advantage over the hyperfractionated protocol. This model was also used to test the effect of radiation dose rate on the development of donor-type chimerism. A significant enhancement was found after an increase in dose rate from 0.1 to 0.7 Gy/min. Further enhancement could be achieved when the dose rate was increased to 1.3 Gy/min, but survival at this high dose rate was reduced. These results demonstrated indirectly that dose rate affects the expression of host-type pluripotent stem cells, the progeny of which appear 3 to 6 weeks after treatment with 8 Gy TBI delivered at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min, but which are eradicated if radiation is delivered at a dose rate of 1.3 Gy/min.\r"

Some physicians prefer use of PBSC because less risk of tumor contamination is believed to exist. This hypothesis was evaluated by immunocytologic analysis of blood samples and concurrently drawn bone marrow (BM) samples and of PBSC harvests obtained from 31 patients with disseminated neuroblastoma. We found circulating neoplastic cells in 75% of specimens analyzed at diagnosis, in 36% during therapy, and in 14% of PBSC harvests. Tumor cells in blood obtained during therapy did not appear until 3 months after the time of diagnosis. Clearance of circulating neuroblastoma cells was documented after two courses of induction chemotherapy. Six of 13 patients with minimal or no BM disease had positive blood specimens. We conclude that substantial risk of tumor contamination of PB harvests exists and recommend that induction chemotherapy be administered before hematopoietic progenitor cells are collected from blood.\r"

  ".W": "Adenine and guanine nucleotide metabolism of platelet concentrates (PCs) was studied during storage for transfusion at 22 +/- 2 degrees C over a 7-day period using high-pressure liquid chromatography. There was a steady decrease in platelet adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which was balanced quantitatively by an increase in plasma hypoxanthine. As expected, ammonia accumulated along with hypoxanthine but at a far greater rate. A fall in platelet guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) paralleled the fall in ATP + ADP. When adenine was present in the primary anticoagulant, it was carried over into the PC and metabolized. ATP, GTP, total adenine nucleotides, and total guanine nucleotides declined more slowly in the presence of adenine than in its absence. With adenine, the increase in hypoxanthine concentration was more rapid and quantitatively balanced the decrease in adenine and platelet ATP + ADP. Plasma xanthine rose during storage but at a rate that exceeded the decline in GTP + GDP. When platelet ATP + ADP was labeled with 14C-adenine at the initiation of storage, half of the radioactivity was transferred to hypoxanthine (45%) and GTP + GDP + xanthine (5%) by the time storage was completed. The isotopic data were consistent with the presence of a radioactive (metabolic) and a nonradioactive (storage) pool of ATP + ADP at the initiation of storage with each pool contributing approximately equally to the decline in ATP + ADP during storage. The results suggested a continuing synthesis of GTP + GDP from ATP + ADP, explaining the slower rate of fall of GTP + GDP relative to the rate of rise of plasma xanthine. Throughout storage, platelets were able to incorporate 14C-hypoxanthine into both adenine and guanine nucleotides but at a rate that was only one fourth the rate of hypoxanthine accumulation. All of these data should be helpful in improving the function and viability of PC as currently stored for 5 days, in devising methods for storage beyond 5 days, and in the development of synthetic media for PC storage.\r"

SETTING--Teaching hospital diabetic clinic. SUBJECTS--40 Patients with insulin dependent diabetes, both of whose parents were alive: 20 with persistent proteinuria and 20 with normal albumin excretion matched for age, duration of diabetes, and body mass index. All 80 parents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Sodium-lithium countertransport activity in red cells and arterial blood pressure. RESULTS--Sodium-lithium countertransport activity in red cells was higher in the patients with proteinuria than in the patients with normoalbuminuria (mean (95% confidence interval) 0.47 (0.39 to 0.54) v 0.33 (0.28 to 0.38) mmol/l red cells/h respectively, p = 0.0036; mean difference 0.14 (0.04 to 0.22)). The mean countertransport activity for the two parents of each patient was calculated, and from this the mean value for each group of parents was calculated; the value was higher in the parents of the patients with proteinuria than in the parents of the patients with normoalbuminuria (0.40 (0.32 to 0.48) v 0.30 (0.26 to 0.33) mmol/l red cells/h respectively, p = 0.016; 0.10 (0.02 to 0.19)). Twenty-eight of the parents of the patients with proteinuria compared with 12 of the parents of the patients with normoalbuminuria had a countertransport activity that was above the median value in all 80 parents (p less than 0.001). Mean arterial blood pressure in the parents of the patients with proteinuria was related to that of their offspring (r = 0.46; p less than 0.01). There was a positive correlation between the sodium-lithium countertransport activity in red cells in the parents and their offspring when all parents and patients were considered (r = 0.37; p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS--Increased sodium-lithium countertransport activity in red cells in the parents of diabetic patients with nephropathy provides further evidence that familial, and possibly genetic, factors related to a predisposition to arterial hypertension have a role in the susceptibility of diabetic renal disease.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the relative importance of osteoporosis of the os calcis, cognisance, and mobility in the risk of subsequent fracture of the hip in elderly women. DESIGN--Prospective study of elderly women in residential care over two years. SETTING--21 Private or 38 local authority residential homes for the elderly and 4 geriatric hospitals in Doncaster and Hull. SUBJECTS--1414 Ambulant women aged over 69, in private or local authority residential care or geriatric care. Those who had had bilateral hip surgery were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Broad band ultrasonic attenuation (BUA) index, Clifton assessment procedures for the elderly test (for cognisance), and mobility on a six point scale, and fracture of the hip in the subsequent two year period. RESULTS--73 Women fractured their hip during the two years. Their mean age was not significantly different from that of the women who did not have a fracture (85.3 (SD 5.6) v 83.9 (6.3); p = 0.07), but their mean BUA index (40.3 (19.3) v 50.9 (22.2) db/MH2), and score for cognisance (median 19 (interquartile range 10.5-27.0) v 24 (17-30)) were significantly lower (both p less than 0.001). These variables had independent associations with fracture of the hip. Women with fractures had a significantly lower score for the psychomotor component of the cognisance test (4.5 (1-8) v 7 (2-10); p less than 0.0025 and were significantly more mobile (1(1-3) v 3 (1-6); p less than 0.02). Subdividing women according to high, medium, and low scores for BUA index and cognisance testing disclosed a high risk group (118 women) with low BUA index and cognisance score, whose incidence of fracture was 12.8%; in the group at lowest risk (136 women) with high BUA index and cognisance score, the incidence of fracture was only 1.5% (relative risk 8.4 (95% confidence interval -2.0 to 35.5]. Further analysis showed that those most at risk were, additionally, most mobile but that less mobile women with good cognisance had a low incidence of fractures, regardless of the BUA index, (1.2%, high index, v 0.9%, low index). CONCLUSIONS--Elderly women most at risk of sustaining hip fractures were those with low BUA index, low cognisance test score, and high mobility. Improving bone strength and cognisance in elderly women may reduce their incidence of hip fracture.\r"

DESIGN--Four and a half year cytological follow up study of women with mild or moderate dyskaryosis in cervical smears. SETTING--666 Women (mean age 28 (SD 8) years; range 14-74) found to have borderline, mild, or moderate dyskaryosis on routine screening. RESULTS--45 Women (6.8%) had a cone biopsy recommended on the basis of an abnormal follow up smear (severe dyskaryosis suggestive of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III or invasive cancer), and in one patient cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III was reported in a biopsy specimen after dilatation and curettage. Life table analysis gave a 14% probability of a patient being recommended for a biopsy after four and a half years of follow up (95% confidence interval 12% to 15%). There was a significant excess incidence of invasive cancer of the cervix in the series compared with the general population (five cases observed compared with less than 0.1 expected). 157 Patients (24%) showed reversion to a normal cell pattern sustained in several smears over more than 18 months but a single negative smear was an unreliable indicator of apparent regression. Having two successive smears showing mild dyskaryosis or a smear at any time showing moderate dyskaryosis was a significant predictor of a subsequent severely dyskaryotic smear. CONCLUSIONS--Women found to have mild or moderate dyskaryosis in cervical smears should be kept under regular surveillance. The optimum management of these patients--by cytology or colposcopy--needs to be determined by randomised controlled trials.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To provide data on consultation rates in general practice for middle aged men over three years according to their age and social class. DESIGN--Prospective study of men over eight years. Data on consultation rates during years 6-8 were collected retrospectively from practice records. SETTING--Over 1000 general practices in Great Britain by year 8. Initially (in 1978-80) the men had been selected at random from one practice in each of 24 towns. SUBJECTS--7013 Men aged 46-65 in the sixth year of follow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Number of consultations a year over three years. RESULTS--The mean annual consultation rate over the three years rose steadily with age (7.0 at age 46-50 to 9.7 at age 61-65) and with social class (6.4 in class I to 10.0 in class V) but was potentially misleading as the distribution was skew: 10.5% of men (736) did not consult over the three years and 17.2% (1209) consulted only once or twice, whereas 11.4% (798) of men were seen more than 18 times. The percentage of men who did not consult over three years fell only slightly with age and was unrelated to social class, with roughly a tenth of all age and social class groups not consulting. Two thirds of non-consulters in year 6 (1598/2334) consulted in year 7 or 8. CONCLUSIONS--The mean is not an appropriate summary measure of consultation rates and may conceal important differences among practices or other groups. The new general practitioner contract stipulates that all patients aged 16-74 must be provided with information to promote health and prevent illness at least once every three years. Most practices will have to approach a tenth of their men aged 46-65 specially to provide this service even if one consultation in three years is regarded as sufficient to allow a service to be provided.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine the traditional view that unawareness of hypoglycaemia and inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus are manifestations of autonomic neuropathy. DESIGN--Perspective assessment of unawareness of hypoglycaemia and detailed assessment of autonomic neuropathy in patients with insulin dependent diabetes according to the adequacy of their hypoglycaemic counterregulation. SETTING--One routine diabetic unit in a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS--23 Patients aged 21-52 with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (seven with symptoms suggesting autonomic neuropathy, nine with a serious clinical problem with hypoglycaemia, and seven without symptoms of autonomic neuropathy and without problems with hypoglycaemia) and 10 controls with a similar age distribution, without a personal or family history of diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Presence of autonomic neuropathy as assessed with a test of the longest sympathetic fibres (acetylcholine sweatspot test), a pupil test, and a battery of seven cardiovascular autonomic function tests; adequacy of hypoglycaemic glucose counterregulation during a 40 mU/kg/h insulin infusion test; history of unawareness of hypoglycaemia; and response of plasma pancreatic polypeptide during hypoglycaemia, which depends on an intact and responding autonomic innervation of the pancreas. RESULTS--There was little evidence of autonomic neuropathy in either the 12 diabetic patients with a history of unawareness of hypoglycaemia or the seven patients with inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation. By contrast, in all seven patients with clear evidence of autonomic neuropathy there was no history of unawareness of hypoglycaemia and in six out of seven there was adequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation. Unawareness of hypoglycaemia and inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation were significantly associated (p less than 0.01). The response of plasma pancreatic polypeptide in the diabetic patients with adequate counterregulation but without autonomic neuropathy was not significantly different from that of the controls (change in plasma pancreatic polypeptide 226.8 v 414 pmol/l). The patients with autonomic neuropathy had a negligible plasma pancreatic polypeptide response (3.7 pmol/l), but this response was also blunted in the patients with inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation (72.4 pmol/l) compared with that of the controls (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS--Unawareness of hypoglycaemia and inadequate glucose counterregulation during hypoglycaemia are related to each other but are not due to autonomic neuropathy. The blunted plasma pancreatic polypeptide responses of the patients with inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation may reflect diminished autonomic activity consequent upon reduced responsiveness of a central glucoregulatory centre, rather than classical autonomic neuropathy.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective double blind randomised study. SETTING--Operating theatre and gynaecology ward of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--63 Woman undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy were randomised to be played either a tape of positive suggestions or a blank tape during the operation through a personal stereo system. INTERVENTIONS--Three women were withdrawn from the study. Anaesthesia was standardised for all of the women. Postoperative analgesia was provided through a patient controlled analgesia system for the first 24 hours. Pain scores were recorded every six hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Morphine consumption over the first 24 hours after the operation; pain scores. RESULTS--Mean morphine requirements were 51.0 mg (95% confidence interval 42.1 to 60.0 mg in the women played positive suggestions; and 65.7 mg (55.6 to 75.7 mg) in those played a blank tape. The point estimate (95% confidence interval) for the difference of means was 14.6 mg (22.4%) (1.9 (2.9%) to 27.3 mg (41.6%] (p = 0.028). Pain scores were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION--Positive intraoperative suggestions seem to have a significant effect in reducing patients' morphine requirements in the early postoperative period.\r"

DESIGN--Cross sectional study of 200 amenorrhoeic women compared with normally menstruating controls. SETTING--Teaching hospital outpatient clinic specialising in reproductive medicine. SUBJECTS--200 Women aged 16-40 with a past or current history of amenorrhoea from various causes and of a median duration of three years, and a control group of 57 age matched normal volunteers with no history of menstrual disorder. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Bone mineral density in the lumbar spine (L1-L4) as measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry. RESULTS--The amenorrhoeic group showed a mean reduction in bone mineral density of 15% (95% confidence interval 12% to 18%) as compared with controls (mean bone mineral density 0.89 (SD 0.12) g/cm2 v 1.05 (0.09) g/cm2 in controls). Bone loss was related to the duration of amenorrhoea and the severity of oestrogen deficiency rather than to the underlying diagnosis. Patients with a history of fracture had significantly lower bone density than those without a history of fracture. Ten patients had suffered an apparently atraumatic fracture. CONCLUSIONS--Amenorrhoea in young women should be investigated and treated to prevent bone mineral loss. Menopausal women with a past history of amenorrhoea should be considered to be at high risk of osteoporosis.\r"

DESIGN--A review of literature and a questionnaire sent to all health authorities and boards in the United Kingdom. SETTING--All health authorities and boards in the United Kingdom. SUBJECTS--167 Health authorities or boards that completed questionnaires (response rate 80%), 59 of which used a screening programme. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Response to questionnaire on policies for screening children for infections on their return from overseas. RESULTS--12 Of the 59 authorities screened all children and one screened only those from the West Indian subcontinent. 13 Authorities excluded children from school while awaiting results; 58 screened for tuberculosis and four for diphtheria. CONCLUSIONS--There is a wide variation in screening policies around the country with no national consensus. Screening for diphtheria, typhoid, and salmonellosis is hard to justify and is probably not effective. Screening for tuberculosis, however, is supported by many authorities, is widely practised, and probably is effective. There is a strong case for rationalisation of screening.\r"

  ".W": "Serum and bone marrow from 18 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and five healthy controls were studied in order to establish a possible role of impaired iron uptake and transferrin binding by erythroblasts in the pathophysiology of anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) in RA. Iron incorporation into erythroblasts was reduced in patients with ACD using a method based on incubation of erythroblasts with radiolabelled 59Fe-125I-transferrin. It correlated negatively with C-reactive protein (CRP). In iron deficient RA patients it tended to be reduced as well. These patients had the same level of RA disease activity as in ACD. Transferrin binding by erythroblasts was significantly impaired in ACD compared to controls, although it tended to be reduced in all RA groups. These findings suggest that impaired iron uptake by erythroblasts, probably due to decreased transferrin binding to erythroblasts, might be a pathophysiological factor in ACD in RA.\r"

For comparison, proteoglycan levels were measured in 15 cadaver synovial fluids (98.9 +/- 44.2 micrograms/ml) and 12 synovial fluids from patients with sports injury (163.7 +/- 79.4 micrograms/ml). Patients were recruited into a trial where synovial fluid was aspirated as often as possible over a 6-month period during which the patients were followed using a number of well proven clinical parameters. No correlation was found between the degree of joint destruction as measured by X-ray damage and the concentration or total amount of proteoglycan in the synovial fluid. In addition, there was no correlation between the level or total amount of proteoglycan and any clinical parameter of disease activity.\r"

However, little is known about the association between the clinical and radiological findings. To evaluate the clinical relevance of shoulder hyperostosis we performed a controlled, blind study of 99 hospitalized probands with and without thoracospinal hyperostosis on lateral chest X-rays. The study included grading of the shoulder hyperostosis on the basis of three bilateral standard radiographs, assessing shoulder pain in a standardized way by an interviewer and recording extraskeletal causes of shoulder pain. The prevalence of shoulder hyperostosis was doubled in probands with thoracospinal hyperostosis compared to controls (chi 2 = 5.90, P less than 0.025, n = 99). Shoulder hyperostosis, irrespective of thoracospinal hyperostosis, predisposed to shoulder pain (40% versus 18%, chi 2 = 4.06, P less than 0.05, n = 74). Shoulder hyperostosis in combination with thoracospinal hyperostosis (shoulder DISH) predisposed to shoulder pain to an even greater extent (46% versus 12%, chi 2 = 6.64, P less than 0.01, n = 47). We conclude that shoulder hyperostosis is a radiological finding of potential clinical relevance.\r"

The recognition of these syndromes may enable us to study aetiology, prognosis, and therapy of LBP in more homogeneous groups of patients.\r"

The generation of cell-free supernatant cytotoxic factor(s) after incubating non-adherent mononuclear cells with U937 cells for 24 h is similar in the azathioprine patients and the controls. A large part of this supernatant cytotoxicity is due to tumour necrosis factor alpha which can be inhibited by a specific monoclonal antibody. The mechanism of the reduced 4 h NK cytotoxicity remains unknown but is probably not related to the anti-inflammatory properties of azathioprine.\r"

When used in therapeutic concentrations in vitro, neither agent had any effect on the chemotactic response of neutrophils isolated from healthy volunteers. This was true for the three chemotactic agents studied: FMLP, zymosan activated serum and purulent sputum. Nabumetone and indomethacin decreased neutrophil chemotaxis over a period of 2 weeks in 12 normal subjects in vivo. The average chemotactic response to 10(-8) mol/l FMLP for all 12 during the control period was 42.1 +/- 6.1 cells per high power field and this fell to 26.1 +/- 4.9 (P less than 0.025) after 7 days and to 15.6 +/- 2.5 (P less than 0.005) after 14 days. The results were similar for both drugs analysed independently. The results suggest that NSAIDs have no effect on the chemotactic response of mature cells in vitro, but suppress chemotaxis progressively when given in vivo. This may be explained by an effect of NSAIDs on maturing cells prior to release into the circulation.\r"

Of the four patients not seen at follow-up, two had developed neurological diseases, another rheumatoid arthritis and one other hypothyroidism. Thus, after 5 years no patient fulfilled the criteria for primary fibromyalgia. Women occupied as manual workers were over-represented. Most patients reported beneficial effects of physiotherapy.

A questionnaire determined their perceptions of staff members, their spouses, and the patients with whom they had most contact. In the usual in- and out-patient setting, patients preferred to be told about their condition by the consultant. In the clinic where they saw a nurse practitioner regularly, over half preferred to be told by her. The patients found it easier to discuss their condition with a nurse (particularly of a lower rank than a sister). Much came from spouses and other patients. The consultant and sister had important roles in reassuring the patients, but doctors were not successful in making patients feel useful and needed. Nurses were somewhat better--but not that good (30%). This was a vital role for the spouse, who nevertheless in hospital produced much anxiety, closely followed by visitors, other patients and doctors. Nurses and occupational therapists were very calming and relaxing people.\r"
