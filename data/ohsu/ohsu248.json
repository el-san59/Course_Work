  ".W": "Most patients with chronic disease can benefit from rehabilitation efforts to optimize their functioning within the limitations placed on them by the disease and/or treatment and to increase their responsibility in their health care. Rehabilitation should include education and counseling in nutrition, behavioral change, exercise conditioning, and clinical concerns. The exercise portion can be accomplished in a supervised or unsupervised setting, depending on the patient's clinical status and needs. The exercise prescription must be modified to meet the clinical needs of the patient. Supervised settings may increase compliance and provide the primary care physician with valuable follow-up information that will assist in long-term medical care. The primary care physician has the responsibility of carefully screening patients, referring them into the appropriate exercise setting, and incorporating the rehabilitation results into the patient's long-term care. Physician support can dramatically enhance the success of the rehabilitation efforts.\r"

Also, training errors are major etiologic factors. Because shin splints result from mechanical overload of various elements of the musculoskeletal system of the leg that exceed their adaptive remodeling capacity, rest and recovery should be emphasized as an important aspect of sports training. Accurate and prompt diagnosis reduces the severity and duration of the injury. Management should consist of measures to reduce inflammation and pain and to identify possible biomechanical factors that may be correctable by strengthening and flexibility exercises or by the use of an orthotic device.\r"

The clinical presentations of arsenic poisoning, both acute and chronic types, represent a wide spectrum, largely dependent on route of exposure, chemical form, and dose. Because the patient or others providing the history may suppress information on exposure and because toxic levels of arsenic in the system drop rapidly in the first 24 hours, swift administration of diagnostic tests is important. Physician follow-up is determined by the route of exposure to arsenic and may involve referral to a social service network or a mental health facility.\r"

Twenty healthy subjects were assigned randomly to one of two treatment groups of 10 subjects each. Each group completed a 25-minute protocol with two 5-minute inversion periods. The research attempted to control for treatment anxiety and for the effects of ocular plethysmography (the procedure used to measure OAP). A 2 X 2 multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to analyze the differences of cardiovascular change between the two inversion methods. The hypothesis that the subjects' HRs, SBPs, and OAPs would not differ between ankle and thigh suspension methods for five minutes of inversion was not rejected. Leg position did not affect the HR or arterial responses during full static inversion. Gravity inversion produced no significant changes in HR and SBP between 2.5 and 5 minutes of inversion. Arterial pressures measured at 5 minutes of static inversion did not differ from arterial pressures measured between 2.5 and 5 minutes, but because of increases in OAP during inversion, ocular safeguards are recommended for subjects during inversion.\r"

Ten physical therapists and 8 physicians participated in individual interviews that were taped and subsequently transcribed. The transcriptions were compiled and analyzed by an interpersonal communication expert (B.W.B.) for trends and themes. Findings of the study include 1) physical therapists want increased accessibility to and communication with physicians and 2) physicians want brief communication with clear objective data provided by the therapists. Basic guidelines developed for physical therapy students as a result of this study include 1) identify physicians with whom you can communicate most easily, 2) learn your physicians' schedules, 3) organize beforehand so that communication is clear and concise, 4) be polite but self-assured, 5) ask your supervisor or other staff therapists for advice, and 6) use the telephone discriminately. This study emphasizes that communication with physicians must be approached on an individual basis. Each physician differs in personality, philosophy of patient care, and expectations of physical therapy. Therapists should take the initiative in developing good rapport and maintaining a viable relationship with physicians.\r"

Twenty healthy, full-term infants were observed longitudinally from 8 to 28 weeks of age. Two of the infants could not complete the study, and two infants never used the prone extension posture. The data from 16 of the infants, therefore, were analyzed. The results indicate that the sequence of development of the prone extension posture consists of head extension, followed by lower extremity extension, and then upper extremity extension. The results also indicate that upper extremity extension in the prone extension posture does not appear to be a prerequisite for the prone-on-elbows or prone-on-hands postures. These findings suggest that infants may use different strategies for developing motor control in the head and lower extremities than in the upper extremities. This information adds to our knowledge of the normal developmental process and may have significance in the planning of physical therapy programs.\r"

  ".W": "Arm cycle ergometry has been shown to be an effective mode of cardiopulmonary training for individuals with spinal cord injuries. Arm cycle ergometry training results in an increased maximal oxygen uptake, exercise-induced bradycardia, and increased physical work capacity. Whether improvements in cardiopulmonary function parallel improvements in functional endurance, however, is unknown. In addition, no readily available tool to evaluate improvements in functional endurance has been identified. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of arm cycle ergometry training on the wheelchair propulsion endurance of individuals with spinal cord injuries. Eight adult men with quadriplegia were evaluated before and after eight weeks of arm cycle ergometry training. A modified Cooper's 12-minute run-walk test, a sustained wheelchair propulsion task, was used to document improvements in functional endurance. Submaximal exercise heart rate, physical work capacity, and maximal oxygen uptake were used to document improvements in cardiopulmonary function. The results demonstrate that improvements in cardiopulmonary function parallel increases in wheelchair propulsion endurance. A sustained 12-minute wheelchair propulsion task is shown to be a readily available tool in the evaluation of functional endurance of individuals with spinal cord injuries. The improvements in wheelchair propulsion endurance should assist the individual in completing activities of school, work, recreation, and daily living.\r"

Because all of the subjects demonstrated generalized hand edema, comparisons of different digits of the same subject could be made on each visit. Effectiveness rankings of the treatment methods were made after each visit. A clear pattern of effectiveness emerged that suggested that superimposing massage on an already-wrapped digit was more effective than either massage or string wrapping alone. Average circumferential reductions of digits further supported the hypothesis that a combination of string wrapping and massage would be more effective than the individual string-wrapping or massage techniques. No significant difference in effectiveness was found between massage and string wrapping when used singularly.\r"

A manual measurement system was used to determine low back contours (LBCs) from S2 upward for 19 cm at 1-cm intervals. Contour data were reduced to mean contour values (MCVs). Results showed that the standing and sitting positions produced the largest and smallest MCVs, respectively (p less than .01). The ILLF MCV was smaller (p less than .05) than both supine MCVs but not appreciably different from the ILLE MCV. The ILLE and ILLF positions significantly reduced (p less than .01) MCVs compared with the standing position. Neither position decreased the MCV as much as the sitting position. These results support the use of inversion therapy to reduce the depth of the LBC when sitting is inappropriate.\r"

Forty-one patients with hemiplegia secondary to cerebrovascular accidents were assigned sequentially to 1) a group that used seat boards only (SB Group), 2) a group that used both seat boards and backboards (SBB Group), or 3) a group that used no boards (Control Group). The SB and SBB Groups used the boards throughout rehabilitation. Wheelchair sitting posture was measured at entry to and discharge from the rehabilitation program. The SB and SBB Groups were measured with and without boards. Anterior-posterior pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, lateral flexion, and lateral pelvic tilt were measured using a gravity goniometer, photographs, and calipers. Use of seat boards was associated with a decreased lateral pelvic tilt of 2.3 degrees at discharge while the seat boards were in place. The use of seat boards and backboards combined was associated with decreased lateral pelvic tilt of 3.1 and 1.6 degrees, increased anterior pelvic tilt of 13.1 and 11.1 degrees, and decreased thoracic kyphosis of 13.0 and 14.2 degrees at entry to and at discharge from the rehabilitation program, respectively, while the boards were in place. At the end of rehabilitation when the boards were removed, no long-term postural changes had occurred in the treatment groups compared with the Control Group. This study demonstrated that seat boards and backboards in wheelchairs improve certain postural deviations of patients with hemiplegia, but that these improvements are not maintained when the boards are removed after 5 to 10 weeks of use.\r"

This clinical report describes serial and inhibitive casts and introduces a precasting work sheet that promotes the selection of appropriate casting patients and necessary planning. The work sheet guides the therapist through an assessment of patient data relevant to casting, including passive range of motion, postural tone and abnormal reflexes, and voluntary movement. The precasting work sheet helps therapists gain expertise in casting by familiarizing them with the factors to consider before casting, encouraging them to set goals for casting, and helping them to determine whether the goals were met.\r"

  ".W": "The first application of phosphorous 31 (31P) and proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to the analysis of the metabolic profiles of skin flaps in a rat model and of human skin grafts is presented. Resonances of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), and inorganic phosphate (Pi) were identified in 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Resonances of phosphocreatine, creatine (Cr), and lactate (Lac) were identified in 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The most significant finding was the substantial presence of phosphocreatine as the major high-energy phosphometabolite in mammalian skin, a finding which heretofore has not been widely recognized. An energy shuttle between phosphocreatine and ATP is operative in skin to buffer the fall in ATP during ischemic (anaerobic) insult. Inability to replenish exhausted phosphocreatine reserves predictively correlates with eventual flap necrosis. We have defined and analyzed temporal fluxes in the phosphocreatine-creatine and phosphocreatine plus creatine-lactate ratios by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. Both are sensitive, accurate, and unambiguous early prognostic indices of eventual flap outcome. These findings support the concept that the fate of a flap may be established as early as 3 hours after elevation and have laid the groundwork for development and application of noninvasive in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to the study of skin flaps in animals and humans.\r"

The most common objection to this otherwise advantageous donor area has been the subsequent nonaesthetic donor-site deformity. In addition, skin grafts frequently fail over the flexor carpi radialis tendon leading to chronic skin breakdown or at best tendon adhesions. Both these concerns may be ameliorated by means of tissue expansion of the remaining dorsal forearm skin to then allow removal of the skin-grafted portion of the donor site. These problems should be anticipated at the time of initial flap elevation so that the same incisions can be used for immediate placement of expanders.\r"

When the injection domes of 22 consecutively removed tissue expanders were checked, we found that the average leakage pressure of these was 32 mmHg, with a range of 8 to 110 mmHg. When the patients were lying on their expanders, the weight of the corresponding body part caused intraluminal pressures of up to 90 mmHg in their expanders. Following removal of the expanders, the total leakage was calculated quantitatively and found to be maximally over 50 percent of the injected volume in some instances. The leakage flow through the injection dome in seven consecutively removed expanders was checked at pressures of 25, 50, and 75 mmHg over 30 minutes and was found to be slow. The possibility of injection dome leakage should be kept in mind, however, as a potential complication under unfavorable conditions. At the same time, we want to emphasize that in most instances tissue expanders function quite well and in predictable ways.\r"

It was found that the survival lengths of the expanded flaps were approximately 50 percent greater than those of the delayed controls. Microangiography suggested that the diameter of the axial artery increased following expansion. In clinical practice this technique would provide a larger flap for reconstruction and the possibility of direct closure of the donor site. In addition, the observed increase in vessel caliber should facilitate the free tissue transfer of expanded flaps.\r"

We therefore reviewed our experience with intramarginal and extramarginal excision of hypertrophic scars. Between October 30, 1979, and March 26, 1986, we excised 50 hypertrophic scars in 23 burn patients. Thirty-one (62 percent) of the excisions were intramarginal and 19 (38 percent) were extramarginal.

Careful clinical examination should rule out the presence of a pathologic fascial cord. When reconstructive surgery is indicated for the rheumatoid hand in the presence of advanced Dupuytren's contracture, staged surgery would be appropriate and reconstruction of Dupuytren's contracture should precede other surgery.\r"

There was 43 percent return of pinch strength for thumb replants compared to 83 percent return for a single thumb revascularization. The most common mechanism of injury was catching the roping thumb in the \"thumb up\" position during dallying. There are good motion and pinch strength with thumb revascularizations provided tendons and the interphalangeal joint are intact. Reconstruction of the flexor pollicis longus in the replanted thumb gave poor results. Primary tenodesis or arthrodesis is recommended.\r"

Advantages of this flap design are (1) the technique is straightforward and rapid, (2) flap viability is reliable, (3) the epigastric skin-fascial donor defect preserves the anterior rectus fascia distal to the linea semicircularis, which prevents hernia, (4) a large arc of rotation is provided, and (5) the epigastric donor site does not interfere with colostomy and urinary conduit stomas in the pelvic exenteration patient. We have done 11 vaginal reconstructions and 9 major pelvic defect reconstructions with this flap during the last 3 1/2 years. In these 20 patients, the only complications were two partial flap losses. No major flap losses or ventral hernias occurred.\r"

A 1-mm2 piezoelectric crystal embedded in a soft silicone sleeve was sutured directly to the blood vessel distal to the anastomosis. Using the dog femoral artery, simultaneous measurement of velocity and blood flow with an electromagnetic flowmeter established a direct correlation between flow and velocity with a 14 percent error at maximum flow and an 18 percent error at minimum flow conditions. The probe was then implanted in the rabbit femoral artery for 1 week (n = 3) and 4 weeks (N = 6), demonstrating that a continuous tracing could be obtained without injury to the vessel. Our clinical study included 63 patients undergoing free-tissue transfers monitored with the implantable probe for 7 to 29 days (average 10.5 days). Twenty-three flaps were buried. Two patients experienced loss of arterial tracing due to malfunction of the probe (3 percent). Three patients had a venous thrombosis with a present arterial tracing. There were no flap failures per se. All probes were removed without mishap, and there were no complications related to the probe. We conclude that the 20-MHz ultrasonic Doppler probe holds promise as a useful monitoring method.\r"

The measurable peak level decreases with time, probably due to increased scarring around the muscle. This model should enable the study of many different classes of antibiotics with different protein binding and other administration schedules using multiple timed doses or a combination of agents.\r"

Nasal parameters studied were changes in interalar rim width and nasal tip projection. It was observed that alar rim width increases with anterior and/or superior repositioning of the maxilla, but increases in nasal tip projection occur only when there is an anterior vector of maxillary movement. These nasal changes could not be quantitatively correlated to magnitude of maxillary movement. Lip changes studied were the horizontal displacement at the vermilion border and subnasale versus that of the incisal edge and point A, respectively, when the maxilla is sagittally advanced and the vertical shortening of the lip versus that of the incisal edge when the maxilla is shortened. Using linear regression analysis, horizontal displacement of the upper lip at the vermilion border was 0.82 +/- 0.13 mm for every 1 mm of maxillary advancement at the incisal edge (p less than 0.001) and 0.51 +/- 0.13 at the subnasale for every 1 mm of maxillary advancement at point A (p less than 0.001). Eighty percent of patients undergoing maxillary intrusive procedures had lip shortening ranging from 20 to 50 percent of the vertical maxillary reduction. Surprisingly, no statistically significant correlation could be demonstrated for lip shortening versus extent of vertical maxillary reduction. Previous literature in disagreement with these findings is discussed. Guidelines for treatment planning utilizing these data are suggested.\r"

This research, based on the dissection of 30 hemifaces, studies the characteristics of those branches using three points of reference: the intertragal notch, the palpebral lateral commissure, and the labial commissure. Tables showing average length and number of branches have been computed with a statistical level of confidence of 99 percent. No fixed common pattern suitable to represent the distribution of branches of the facial nerve in a model was found, but as a rule, these branches run beneath the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) in their path below the zygomatic arch, and approximate emergence points have been identified. In the opinion of the authors, such points may be of more surgical relevance than a theoretical pattern of arborization.\r"

It has been our flap of choice for purposes of reconstructing the moderate- or large-sized breast. In particular, the midabdominal flap permits restoration of fascial continuity over the entirety of the abdominal wall without the necessity for synthetic materials. A 2.2 percent incidence of hernias has been observed over a 4-year period. The flap is well suited to immediate reconstruction of the breast, particularly among the growing number of patients with antecedent radiation therapy.\r"

The pressure in the expander is thereafter gradually decreased by taking out saline until both the capillary refill and all other clinical criteria are sufficient for safe dermal circulation. Comparison of the expander volume at the final pressure to the initial filling volume at the same pressure before the \"overfilling\" confirmed an average gain of about 59 percent in 14 patients.\r"

We reviewed our first 16 patients to describe the indications and contraindications for the use of tissue expansion in the lower extremity. Guidelines evolved from study of the data. Soft-tissue expansion merits consideration for coverage of problem wounds, in preparation for removal of large benign lesions, and for the repair of contour defects. The operator should know that an open wound below the knee predicts a complication if soft-tissue expansion is attempted in that location. In the thigh, incisions can be confidently placed at the edge of the defect. In every location, large expanders should be chosen so that they are as long as or longer than the adjacent defect. The increase in circumference of the limb should be followed. Simple designs for advancement flaps usually work well. As our experience has grown, reconstruction using soft-tissue expansion in the lower extremity has become safer and the results more predictable through better patient selection and diligent monitoring of intraluminal pressures, even if only by ensuring that the patient is always comfortable. Soft-tissue expansion has a role in reconstruction of the lower extremity.\r"

Technetium-99m bone scans and computerized tomography are not indicated in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis associated with pressure sores. Plain pelvic x-ray, white cell count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis if any test is positive, is the most sensitive (89 percent), specific (88 percent), noninvasive workup. Jamshidi needle biopsy may be useful where these tests are negative and a clinical suspicion of osteomyelitis remains. Extent of surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy can then be rationally decided on the basis of this information.\r"

In this study, two enzyme systems involved in free-radical metabolism were used to compare a distal skin flap to a skin graft. Forty-two rats were divided into several test groups. A 10 X 3 cm dorsal rat flap was used, and tissue biopsies for xanthine oxidase and malonyldialdehyde (MDA) were obtained 2.5, 5.5, and 8.5 cm from the base of the flap at the hours given. In group I (control), the flap was outlined but not elevated, and biopsies were obtained. In group II, the flap was elevated, and biopsies were obtained at 6 hours. In group III, the flap was elevated, the distal 4 X 3 cm was amputated and replaced as a full-thickness skin graft, and biopsies were obtained at 6 hours. In group IV, the flap was elevated, and biopsies were obtained at 12 hours. In group V, the flap was treated as in group III, and biopsies were obtained at 12 hours. In group VI, the flap was elevated, and biopsies were obtained at 24 hours. In group VII, the flap was treated as in group III, and biopsies were obtained at 24 hours. Results: Xanthine oxidase was significantly higher in all distal biopsies compared to proximal biopsies. Xanthine oxidase also increased with time. Malonyldialdehyde increased over time as well as with distance from the flap base. Distal flap biopsies at 24 hours had greatly increased levels of malonyldialdehyde compared to skin grafts (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The flap is harvested from the left groin and thigh of an inbred female rat and is transferred to a subcutaneous pocket in the left groin of a male rat of the same inbred strain. The femoral vessels supplying the flap are anastomosed end-to-end with the femoral vessels of the recipient. Thirty flaps have been transferred, with 5 technical failures. Three of the remaining 25 flaps developed necrosis within 24 hours. The other 22 flaps remained viable until the rat was sacrificed at 7 days. The survival rate of the thigh flap was thus 88 percent. The model is suitable for use in metabolic, vascular, and immunologic studies of composite free flaps.\r"

The extent of the lesion was clearly identified on images obtained with long repetition time and long echo time; a diffuse, low-intensity area accompanied by tiny high-intensity spots was seen subjacent to the endometrium. The area appeared as a localized or diffuse thickening of the junctional zone because it was often isointense with this zone. Pathologic examination confirmed that the extent of adenomyosis correlated well with the low-intensity region on MR images and that both hemorrhagic areas and nonbleeding endometrial tissue corresponded to the high-intensity spots. The lesion consisted of distorted and compacted smooth muscle cells, but microscopic studies failed to explain the definitive difference in intensity between areas of adenomyosis and myometrium.\r"

A correct diagnosis based on CT findings was made in 159 of 174 patients (91%) with 13 false-positive (8%) and two false-negative diagnoses (1%). The 13 false-positive diagnoses highlight the need for confirmation of diagnosis with biopsy. The accuracy of staging with CT was compared with that of angiography (42 patients) and surgery (51 patients). CT was more accurate than angiography in demonstrating tumor involvement of major peripancreatic vessels. Staging criteria were reliable: No unresectable tumors based on CT findings were found to be resectable during surgery (42 patients), while only three of nine resectable tumors based on CT findings were found to be unresectable. Thus, no tumors were incorrectly staged, which would potentially deny surgery for a patient. The average survival rate after resection was 14 months, while the survival rates after palliative (biliary or gastrointestinal bypass) or no treatment were 8 months and 5 months, respectively.\r"

When partial hepatectomy had been performed with no complications, findings at CT included a small region of low attenuation at the surgical margin, probably due to transient accumulation of blood and bile; a right pleural effusion; extraluminal gas; shift of abdominal organs; hepatic regeneration; and fat attenuation at the resection margin representing the omental patch placed at surgery.

Surgery or autopsy revealed that the colon was involved in 17 patients, the small bowel in 13, and the stomach in one (some patients had multiple sites of involvement). The prospective CT interpretation enabled a specific diagnosis of bowel ischemia or infarction in only six of 23 patients (26%). However, in 13 patients (56%), the CT scans were considered useful in patient treatment. A retrospective review of CT scans indicated that bowel dilatation was present in 13 of 23 patients (56%); however, it was not always restricted to the ischemic area. Six of 23 patients (26%) had bowel wall thickening greater than 3 mm, but two had thickening in areas that were not ischemic at surgery. Pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous gas were seen in only five patients (22%) and three patients (13%), respectively. Superior mesenteric artery thrombosis and free intraperitoneal gas were each found in only one patient (4%).\r"

Eighty-two neurologically normal infants were examined with a 1.5-T unit with use of spin-echo T1-weighted and T2-weighted pulse sequences. The infants ranged in age from 4 days to 2 years. The images were assessed for qualitative changes of white matter relative to gray matter in 14 anatomic areas of the brain and correlated with the patient's age. The MR images showed that changes of brain maturation occur in an orderly manner, commencing in the brain stem and progressing to the cerebellum and the cerebrum. Changes caused by brain myelination were seen earlier on T1-weighted images than on T2-weighted images, possibly because of T1 shortening by the components of the developing myelin sheaths. The later changes on the T2-weighted images correlated best with the development of myelination as demonstrated with histochemical methods. T1-weighted images were most useful in the monitoring of normal brain development in the first 6-8 months of life; T2-weighted images were more useful after 6 months. The milestones in the MR appearance of normal maturation of the brain are presented. Persistent areas of long T2 relaxation times are seen superior and dorsal to the ventricular trigone in all infants examined and should not be mistaken for ischemic change.\r"

In all cases there was evidence of associated degenerative disk disease at the level of involvement. Histopathologic sections in three cases of type 1 change demonstrated disruption and fissuring of the end plates and vascularized fibrous tissue, while in three cases of type 2 change they demonstrated yellow marrow replacement. In addition, 16 patients with end-plate changes documented with MR were studied longitudinally. Type 1 changes in five of six patients converted to a type 2 pattern in 14 months to 3 years. Type 2 changes in ten patients remained stable over a 2-3-year period.

MR images provided more accurate and detailed information regarding the extent of involvement than did radionuclide bone scans, computed tomographic scans, or standard radiographs. It permitted the differentiation of septic arthritis or cellulitis from osteomyelitis.

Microscopic findings, available in five patients, indicated that these areas of increased intensity corresponded to degeneration and inflammation of the rotator cuff. A previously injected long-acting steroid preparation combined with a local anesthetic, which also produces an area of increased signal intensity on long TR, long TE images, can cause problems with image interpretation. No tears of the rotator cuff were detected with MR imaging. However, a full-thickness cuff tear was detected with arthrography in three patients. Although based on a relatively small group of patients, these preliminary findings suggest that MR imaging is capable of demonstrating rotator cuff abnormalities in patients with impingement syndrome.\r"

A significant 17% increase in CCL was observed after 10 minutes of exposure. No further significant variation was observed during exposure, and the CCL was back to preexposure values 10 minutes after exposure. No other arrhythmogenic effect was noted during the 24-hour monitoring. No statistically significant change was observed at either 0 or 1 T. The magnetically induced blood-flow potentials superimposed on the T wave were observed. The CCL increase during exposure could reflect a direct or indirect effect of magnetic fields on the sinus node, which is probably harmless in healthy subjects. However, its safety in dysrhythmic patients remains to be determined.\r"

The authors have developed a new technique named FRODO (Flow and Respiratory artifact Obliteration with Directed Orthogonal pulses) to suppress these artifacts. Signal from tissues responsible for the artifacts is eliminated by use of radio frequency pulses specifically optimized for high selectivity to saturate proton magnetization over one or more independently defined slabs (large rectangular volumes) of tissue. Ghost artifacts from pulsatile flow in the heart and blood vessels, as well as from respiratory motion and swallowing, are suppressed. Additional applications of this technique include elimination of intraluminal signal in blood vessels and suppression of wraparound artifact along the phase-encoding axis. Preliminary clinical experience suggests that the FRODO technique, in conjunction with other flow compensation methods, may provide a definitive solution to the problem of motion in spine imaging. FRODO pulse sequences may also prove useful for imaging of blood vessels, heart, abdomen, and other areas where motion, flow, or wraparound artifacts limit image quality.\r"

When fast Fourier flow imaging is used in combination with echocardiographic gating, arterial flow can be determined and velocity versus time profiles can be generated. Because of the high spatial resolution, down to 0.3 mm, detailed examination of flow profiles is possible even in smaller vessels. The method works equally well on a low-field-strength system operating at 0.23 T and on a high-field-strength system with 4.7-T field strength. Since the experiment is very fast, with acquisition times ranging from 4 seconds for a single-section experiment to about 4 minutes for the electrocardiographically gated variant, it can easily be combined with a conventional MR imaging examination.\r"

In addition to 13 previously diagnosed cases, five cases were newly diagnosed during the study. Lesions causing significant morbidity and mortality--such as cerebellar and spinal cord hemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma--were correctly depicted with MR imaging, sometimes before symptoms had developed and before the lesions could be seen with other imaging modalities. Central nervous system abnormalities were most clearly shown, but MR imaging also adequately demonstrated abdominal visceral abnormalities. It is therefore highly useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of Hippel-Lindau disease.\r"

With partial-flip magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, S/N was nearly equal for 2DFT and 3DFT imaging when both were optimized with respect to TR and flip angle. 3DFT imaging can have cross-section artifacts that exceed those of 2DFT imaging. For very thin sections these artifacts may be lessened, and 3DFT imaging can achieve this with smaller gradient pulses.

Estimated expenses for a typical MR imaging installation were $968,000, with a net annual revenue of $46,000 or more. Compared with 1985 data from the same study group, weekly patient volume and hours of operation have increased--from 35 to 58 patients and from 54 to 69 hours. Installations are more efficient, as the number of patients examined per hour has increased from 0.6 to 0.8. Demand for MR imaging is growing, as the outpatient scheduling delay has increased from 5.3 to 11.4 days. The financial position of MR imaging units has markedly improved from a previous loss of $460,000 to an estimated current gain of +46,000 or more annually. MR imaging installations have shown improvement by several objective criteria - patient throughput, operational efficiency, and financial net revenues.\r"

  ".W": "There are no easy answers to the question of whether a mammography screening practice should accept self-referred women. The major reason for doing so is the fact that many women are not being screened either because their primary care physicians do not initiate mammography screening referrals or because they do not have a physician at all. However, this compelling argument is at least partially countered by the numerous problems encountered when practices accept self-referred women, including potential adverse medicolegal consequences, tedious and time-consuming reporting requirements, the possibility of turf battles with referring physicians, and, especially if breast physical examination is not offered, somewhat increased costs of screening. The ultimate decision of whether self-referred women are accepted will probably be based on an analysis of the prevailing conditions in each radiologist's local environment. Because local conditions vary greatly, so may the final decision vary. However, once the choice is made, steps should be taken to provide ready access to screening while also reducing the frequency with which self-referral-related problems occur. To this end, those radiologists who decide to accept self-referred women, particularly if screening is done with mammography alone, should attempt to convert as many self-referred cases as possible into patient-initiated physician referrals. Similarly, radiologists who decide to screen on a referral-only basis should develop mechanisms that make it very easy for self-referred women to obtain physician referrals.\r"

This constellation of findings is referred to as the blue toe syndrome (BTS). In 12 patients who experienced 14 spontaneous episodes of BTS, angiography demonstrated 15 proximal atherosclerotic arterial lesions, which were presumed to be the source of the microemboli. Fourteen of the 15 lesions were short-segment stenoses or occlusions distal to the aortic bifurcation. Six lesions were treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs followed by delayed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) 6-12 weeks later. Three lesions were treated with surgical bypass, three with long-term anticoagulation, and one with transcatheter clot aspiration and immediate PTA. Two were treated with immediate thrombolytic therapy and had embolic complications. Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy followed by delayed PTA may be an effective alternative to surgery for treating BTS.\r"

Three clinical and three angiographic features were common to these eight patients: (a) few clinical episodes of microembolization; (b) no episodes of macroembolization; (c) no livedo reticularis in the affected extremity, and no symptoms of systemic cholesterol embolization; (d) focal, high-grade (greater than 90%) stenoses that were hemodynamically significant; (e) no diffuse atheromas in the aorta; (f) patent tibial runoff arteries. Affected patients with these clinical and angiographic characteristics make up a subgroup, previously unrecognized, to the authors' knowledge, in whom PTA followed by antiplatelet therapy should be the initial treatment of choice. The blue digit syndrome in these patients was probably due to microemboli composed of fibrinoplatelet aggregates rather than cholesterol debris.\r"

These changes have resulted in the need for a review of the physical factors that influence the flow of contrast agents through flush catheters. Various contrast agents were injected through several types of high-pressure, high-flow catheters with small outer diameters, and the flow rates were measured. Great differences in the viscosities of contrast agents resulted in proportionately smaller differences in maximum flow rates, and warming the contrast agent from room to body temperature had little effect on the maximum flow rate, except for the most viscous contrast agents. The maximum flow rates of the new low-osmolality contrast agents did not differ significantly from those of conventional ionic contrast agents of similar iodine concentration. With unheated contrast agents, iodine delivery was more rapid for contrast agents with iodine concentrations of 280-300 mg/mL.\r"

SE magnitude and phase images were obtained and retrospectively evaluated in 21 patients referred for potential cardiovascular abnormalities in which intracardiac or intravascular signal was detected. Abnormalities included intravascular and intracardiac thrombus, aneurysm, aortic dissection, flow alteration, atherosclerotic disease, and congenital cardiac anomaly. Thrombosis (six cases) was successfully differentiated from flow-related signal (15 cases) by comparing phase images with SE magnitude images; in cases of thrombosis, there was no phase shift in corresponding areas of increased signal intensity. In comparison, SE magnitude signal intensities alone were not an accurate indicator in differentiating thrombus from flow-related enhancement. Because phase images are sensitive for identifying flow, the SE magnitude signal of intravascular tumor or thrombus can be differentiated from that of flow effects with more clinical confidence.\r"

Reports were sent to each patient and to the patient's primary care physician, if she had one. The program was successful in that the number of examinations performed per day increased from 36 to 80 within 6 months. Approximately 50% of the women who came for screening did so at their own request. Self-referred women with abnormal findings on mammograms who did not have a primary care physician were contacted by phone and told of the results. Advice was given for further evaluation, and the patient was referred to a local physician if she still did not know of one. Further workup in patients with abnormal findings was verified with the use of computer tracking and follow-up phone calls. Self-referral is an important component of screening mammography, but it places added responsibility on the radiologist in cases in which there is no referring physician.\r"

The frequency of metastases to normal-sized lymph nodes is a critical issue related to the sensitivity of CT. The authors prospectively examined 42 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma with CT; in 39, careful surgical-pathologic correlation of mediastinal lymph node status was possible. Only 7% had metastases limited to mediastinal lymph nodes that were normal-sized at CT. This reflected a low overall frequency of metastases to normal-sized nodes and several diagnostic factors that converted potentially false-negative studies into true-positive CT studies. In this small series, metastases to enlarged nodes were more likely to have extracapsular spread of tumor, a poor prognostic factor. Overall, the authors do not consider metastases to normal-sized mediastinal lymph nodes to be a major problem in CT staging of non-small cell lung cancer.\r"

Preoperative CT scans accurately demonstrated chest wall invasion in only two of ten patients with chest wall or diaphragmatic invasion. CT demonstrated pericardial involvement in only one of three patients. Tumor extension to within 2 cm of the tracheal carina was seen with CT in one of three patients. Eleven of 26 patients had limited ipsilateral mediastinal (N2) disease; eight of 11 had affected nodes greater then 10 mm on CT scans. As previously shown, CT is of limited value in the assessment of chest wall, mediastinal, pleural, or pericardial tumor extension; however, such extension does not preclude complete resection. Ipsilateral node involvement does not preclude surgery. Familiarity with the new staging system and awareness of what constitutes potentially resectable disease are necessary for an adequate assessment of CT findings.\r"

Edematous fluid resulted in thickening and increased visibility of interlobular septa. In three emphysematous lungs, high-resolution CT accurately demonstrated the degree of emphysema and suggested its centrilobular nature. In two lungs with honeycombing, cysts lined by fibrosis were easily seen on high-resolution CT scans. In less severely involved areas, septal thickening and intralobular fibrosis were seen on high-resolution CT scans, but small (1 mm) cysts were invisible. High-resolution CT was able to demonstrate some features of the normal secondary pulmonary lobule and structural alterations produced by various diseases.\r"

The catheters were inserted under computed tomographic or fluoroscopic guidance for the treatment of large (greater than 35%) or symptomatic pneumothoraxes. Twenty-eight of 30 patients were treated successfully with the small catheters alone; two patients underwent surgical placement of 32-F tubes (4 and 12 hours later) because of incomplete resolution of the pneumothoraxes. This series demonstrates that small-caliber catheters effectively decompress pneumothoraxes and that they can be inserted expeditiously by radiologists in the radiology department.\r"

There were 16 true-positive, ten true-negative, two false-positive, and 11 false-negative examinations. Five false-negative studies resulted from microscopic disease found at SLL. In group 1, there were eight false-negative studies. In five, macroscopic disease was not recognized. In group 2, there were three false-negative studies; in one, macroscopic disease was not recognized. Statistical analysis showed an observable improvement in the accuracy in group 2. The differences included use of faster scanners, routine use of thin sections for the pelvis, and air-contrast colonic opacification in group 2.

The diagnosis was proved by means of percutaneous fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination in 20 patients, surgical biopsy in one, and clinical and CT follow-up in seven. In 14 of the 28 patients, there was increased uptake of the NP-59 on the side of the adrenal mass detected at CT (concordant uptake). Thirteen of the 14 masses with concordant uptake were greater than 2 cm in diameter, and one was 1.5 cm; all were found to be adenomas. In 11 of 28 patients there was decreased uptake on the side of the mass detected at CT (discordant uptake). None of these 11 masses were adenomas; nine were metastases and two were adrenal cysts. Uptake was indeterminate (symmetric) in three patients, two of whom had adrenal adenomas and one an adrenal metastasis; each mass with indeterminate uptake was less than 2 cm in diameter.\r"

All nine lesions with an adrenal mass-liver signal intensity ratio of 0.71 or less were metastases, and all 15 with a ratio of 0.78 or more were adenomas. Eleven masses (31%)--including six adenomas, three metastases, a pheochromocytoma, and a neuroblastoma--had ratios between these values. Nine of ten masses with adrenal mass-fat intensity ratios of 0.35 or less were metastases, and all 12 with ratios of 0.42 or more were benign. Eleven masses (31%), four malignant and one benign, had ratios between these values. The ratios for two masses could not be calculated due to lack of fat. The specificity of T1-weighted MR imaging in differentiating benign from malignant adrenal masses appears similar to that reported for T2-weighted imaging. However, significant overlap occurred, as has also been reported for T2-weighted imaging. While both imaging sequences may help distinguish benign from malignant adrenal masses in some cases, biopsy is still necessary when an accurate histologic diagnosis is essential.\r"

An average of 98 mL of ROM was discarded during cerebral angiography and 175 mL during PTCA. When low-osmolality contrast media (LOM) were used, the cost of discarded ROM was 15.8% of the technical charge for cerebral angiography and 21.5% for PTCA. If LOM were used, a savings of $11,000 per year could be achieved if 80-mL, rather than 100-mL, bottles were used for cerebral angiography and $35,000 per year if a single 300-mL bottle with inverted-Y tubing were used, rather than two 200-mL bottles currently employed for PTCA. Substantial savings could be realized by modifying technical procedures and by increasing the range of bottle sizes in which ROM are marketed.\r"

The S/N of ferrite-enhanced in vivo MR images of lymphomatous spleen was 12.4 +/- 0.9, which was significantly greater than normal (5.7 +/- 0.2, P less than .005). Similar experiments with animal models of micronodular lymphoma also demonstrated that ferrite-enhanced MR imaging can distinguish micronodular lymphoma from normal spleen.

This survey documents the underuse of screening mammography by family physicians who are members of the Michigan Academy of Family Physicians. The underuse of mammography by this physician sample was due to two main factors: The physicians perceived far more disadvantages than advantages with mammography and perceived problems (with, e.g., equipment, effectiveness, and patient acceptance) as pervasive. To change the attitudes and referral behavior of family physicians, one must take into account the specific, negative perceptions of the procedure and place an emphasis on the initial referral, since subsequent referrals are easier to implement.\r"

The processing techniques have been optimized in previous work to selectively enhance the retrocardiac and subdiaphragmatic areas without significant alteration of detail in the lung. Eight observers were shown 150 test radiographs (50 unprocessed, 50 processed with adaptive filtration, 50 processed with histogram equalization) containing 150 nodules. The results indicate a statistically significant (P less than .03) difference, with highest observer performance in the chest radiographs processed with adaptive filtration (median area under ROC curve = 0.78), compared with unprocessed images (median = 0.68) and chest radiographs processed with histogram equalization (median = 0.62). Performance in the lung was not significantly different. Adaptive filtration applied to selectively enhance underexposed areas of film images may improve nodule detection. Histogram equalization provided no improvement in performance.\r"

Frontal chest radiographs of 40 patients with subtle cancers, 40 patients with obvious cancers, and 40 healthy control subjects were shown to four observers for four different viewing times (0.25 second, 1 second, 4 seconds, and unlimited time). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to compare the detectability of lesions. Performance was degraded as viewing time decreased. The true-positive fractions for subtle and obvious cancers were 30% and 70% at 0.25 second and 74% and 98% at unlimited viewing time, respectively, for a given false-positive fraction of 20%. Thus, even with unlimited viewing time, the false-negative fraction for subtle cancers was 26%. The difference in detectability between subtle and obvious lung cancers was exaggerated at 1.0 second compared with 4 seconds and unlimited viewing time. The following conclusions were reached: (a) a substantial proportion of subtle lung lesions are missed, even with unlimited viewing time; (b) a large proportion of obvious lung cancers are detected with flash viewing; (c) the detectability of lesions decreases considerably as viewing time becomes less than 4 seconds; and (d) differences in detectability are exaggerated by short viewing times.\r"

With use of three equal gradients in the read direction, velocity-related phase changes were minimized by placing the dephasing gradient after the 180 degree pulse and near the read gradient. Acceleration effects were minimized through the use of short echo times and cardiac gating. Both velocity- and acceleration-produced phase changes were corrected with the four-gradient scheme but at the expense of some limitations in spatial resolution. Both techniques consistently produced satisfactory images of the carotid bifurcation in healthy individuals. However, the results indicate that the present gradient-phase modulation techniques have several drawbacks, including susceptibility to patient motion, overlapping with the jugular vein, and inability to image carotid stenosis accurately due to turbulence.\r"

These parameters were manipulated to adjust signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and contrast: flip angle (3 degrees-18 degrees), TR (22-60 msec), and TE (12.5-25 msec). Flip angle had the greatest effect on S/N and contrast; its effect differed between axial and sagittal imaging. Cerebrospinal fluid S/N reached a peak at a smaller flip angle in sagittal imaging than in axial imaging. The useful range of flip angles depended on TR. Increasing TR had minimal direct effect on S/N or contrast, but because a longer TR allowed the use of larger flip angles for both axial and sagittal imaging, higher S/N could be achieved with similar contrast. This effect of increasing TR had to be balanced against increased imaging time and increased probability of motion artifact. Increasing TE decreased S/N, increased contrast, and increased magnetic susceptibility artifacts. For the diagnosis of cervical disk disease, the best sequence appears to be one with a very short TR, short TE, and small flip angles within a narrow range.\r"

Sagittal T2-weighted, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-gated images and sagittal and axial GRASS images were obtained in all patients. The following GRASS parameters were manipulated to determine their effect on signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and contrast: flip angle (4 degrees-18 degrees), TR (22-50 msec), and TE (12.5-25 msec). Flip angle had the greatest effect on S/N and contrast. There were no differences between axial and sagittal imaging for the spinal cord or lesion. However, because the signal intensity of CSF did differ on sagittal and axial images and because this influenced the conspicuity of lesions, there was a difference in the useful flip angle range for axial and sagittal imaging. No one set of imaging parameters was clearly superior, and in all patients, the gated image was superior to the sagittal GRASS image in lesion detection. GRASS images should be used in the axial plane primarily to confirm spinal cord disease detected on sagittal CSF-gated images. For this, a balanced approach is suggested (TR = 40 msec, TE = 20 msec, with flip angles of 4 degrees-6 degrees for sagittal and 6 degrees-8 degrees for axial imaging).\r"

Sampling-related effects (Gibbs phenomenon) at spinal cord edges and cerebrospinal fluid interfaces can lead to different signal patterns within the spinal cord and canal. These artifacts cause problems in interpretation, especially with the use of small object-to-pixel size ratios, by obscuring anatomy and simulating pathologic conditions such as pseudosyringes.

Anterior wedge fractures were most commonly seen in the midthoracic spine and about the thoracolumbar junction, whereas central compression fractures were most common from the first to the fourth lumbar levels. Solitary wedge fractures did not occur above the seventh thoracic vertebra, suggesting that a cause other than osteoporosis must be suspected in any patient with an isolated high thoracic fracture. Analysis of the spinal radiographs obtained in an additional 16 women without osteoporosis revealed that both forms of fracture were unusual in this small group with normal spinal mineralization. The number of anterior wedge fractures in the thoracic spine correlated (r = .546) with the degree of thoracic kyphosis. However, 19% of the women with no thoracic fractures still had thoracic hyperkyphosis. The authors conclude that the hyperkyphosis of osteoporotic women is related to anterior compression fractures but also has contributing nonskeletal factors.\r"

In five patients, the response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy was monitored in a long-term follow-up study. In one patient, the P-31 MR spectra were recorded during the infusion of chemotherapeutic drugs. In comparison with healthy muscle tissue of patients, the tumors showed elevated inorganic phosphate, phosphomonoester, and phosphodiester peaks and reduced creatine phosphate peaks, whereas the nucleoside 5'-triphosphate levels remained nearly unchanged. Tumor treatment resulted in changes in the ratio of the signal intensity value of creatine phosphate to that of inorganic phosphate and in the sum of these values. In an osteosarcoma, an initial response followed by renewed tumor growth was clearly indicated by changes in these parameters. In the short-term follow-up examination, slight spectral changes were observed during the infusion of chemotherapeutic drugs. Changes in the concentrations of phosphorus metabolites during therapy can therefore be monitored in human tumors by means of P-31 MR spectroscopy.\r"

Indeed, it is likely that a majority of U.S. hospitals have cared for patients who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. More than 46,000 individuals with HIV infection have fulfilled the strict diagnostic criteria for AIDS (1). All of these patients with AIDS have been seriously ill and have been hospitalized, often multiple times and for prolonged periods. Another, larger group patients with HIV infection has had another form of the disease, the so-called AIDS-related complex. Many of these patients have also spent time in hospitals. An even larger group of individuals has been infected with HIV but has remained asymptomatic to date. Some of these persons have been admitted to hospitals or have received outpatient diagnostic procedures for intercurrent medical or dental complaints that were unrelated to their asymptomatic HIV infection. At the time of their medical evaluation, some of these asymptomatic individuals were known to have a positive HIV antibody test. It is likely, however, that the serologic status of the majority of asymptomatically infected patients was unknown. Thus, by now a very large number of health-care personnel in the United States, including diagnostic radiology staff, have assisted in the care of HIV-infected patients.\r"

N-type and L-type calcium channels differed in voltage dependence, unitary barium conductance, and pharmacology. Nitrendipine inhibited activity of L-type channels but not N-type channels. Potassium-evoked norepinephrine release was markedly reduced by cadmium and the conesnail peptide toxin omega-Conus geographus toxin VIA, agents that block both N- and L-type channels, but was little affected by nitrendipine at concentrations that strongly reduce calcium influx, as measured by fura-2. Thus N-type calcium channels play a dominant role in the depolarization-evoked release of norepinephrine.\r"

Concerted evolution of the gene family is thought to be mediated by interchromosomal recombination between rDNA repeat units, but such events would also result in conservation of the sequences distal to the rDNA on these five pairs of chromosomes. To test this possibility, a DNA fragment spanning the junction between rDNA and distal flanking sequence has been cloned and characterized. Restriction maps, sequence data, and gene mapping studies demonstrate that (i) the rRNA genes are transcribed in a telomere-to-centromere direction, (ii) the 5' end of the cluster and the adjacent non-rDNA sequences are conserved on the five pairs of chromosomes, and (iii) the 5' end of the cluster is positioned about 3.7 kb upstream from the transcription initiation site of the first repeat unit. The data support a model of concerted evolution by interchromosomal recombination.\r"

Molecular analyses of two HIV-1 isolates derived in two independent laboratories from a blood sample from this worker showed that the isolates were indistinguishable from a genotypic form of HIV-1 present in the H9/HTLV-IIIB cell line. Exposure to this strain of virus most probably occurred during work with concentrated virus or culture fluids from virus-producing cell lines under standard Biosafety Level 3 containment. Although no specific incident leading to this infection has been identified, undetected skin contact with virus culture supernatant might have occurred. This worker was the only one found to be positive among the subgroup of 99 workers who shared a work environment involving exposure to concentrated virus. The incidence rate of 0.48 per 100 person-years exposure indicates that prolonged laboratory exposure to concentrated virus is associated with some risk of HIV-1 infection, which is comparable to the risk for health care workers experiencing a needle stick exposure. While none of the ten workers with parenteral exposure to HIV-1 in this cohort became infected, a worker in another laboratory did seroconvert following an injury with a potentially contaminated needle. Strict Biosafety Level 3 containment and practices should be followed when working with concentrated HIV-1 preparations, and further refinement of the procedures may be necessary.\r"

Healthy persons display only chance deviations beyond predicted ranges. Patients with neurological impairment, subtle cognitive dysfunctions, or psychiatric disorders (including dementia and primary depression) show a high incidence of abnormal values. The magnitude of the deviations increases with clinical severity. Different disorders are characterized by distinctive profiles of abnormal values of brain electrical features. Computerized differential classification of some of these disorders can be achieved with high accuracy. Such classification, providing objective corroboration of brain dysfunctions, may be a useful adjunct to psychiatric diagnosis, which relies primarily on subjective clinical impressions. These methods may provide independent criteria for diagnostic validity, evaluations of treatment efficacy, and more individualized therapy.\r"

Protoplasts of fertilized eggs were tested for their ability to establish an axis in accordance with an orienting vector of unilateral light. The results demonstrate that cell wall is not required for axis formation. However, the orientation of the axis remains labile until new cell wall is synthesized. The presence of a cell wall is an absolute requirement for axis fixation.\r"

  ".W": "The high cumulative incidence of AIDS and the large percentage of AIDS patients with no identified risks in Belle Glade, Florida, were evaluated through case interviews and neighborhood-based seroepidemiologic studies. It was found that of 93 AIDS patients reported between July 1982 and 1 August 1987, 34 could be directly linked to at least one other AIDS patient or to a person with AIDS-related complex by sexual contact, sharing of needles during intravenous drug abuse (or both), or perinatal exposure; of 877 randomly selected adults, 28 had antibodies to HIV; no person over age 60 and none of 138 children aged 2 to 10 years had antibodies to HIV; no clustering of infected persons within households occurred, except in sex partners; and HIV-seropositive adults were more likely than HIV-seronegative adults to be from Haiti, have a lower income, report sex with intravenous drug abusers, and have a history of previous treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. The presence of antibodies to five arboviruses prevalent in South Florida or the Caribbean did not correlate significantly with HIV infection. The high cumulative rate of AIDS in Belle Glade appears to be the result of HIV transmission through sexual contact and intravenous drug abuse; the evidence does not suggest transmission of HIV through insects.\r"

To characterize the ionic mechanisms underlying somatostatin effects, voltage-clamp and current-clamp studies on single CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal slice preparation were performed. Both somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14 elicited a steady outward current and selectively augmented the noninactivating, voltage-dependent outward potassium current known as the M-current. Since the muscarinic cholinergic agonists carbachol and muscarine antagonized this current, these results suggest a reciprocal regulation of the M-current by somatostatin and acetylcholine.\r"

However, it has not been demonstrated directly whether this increase in synaptic transmission is caused by an enhancement of transmitter release or an increase in the sensitivity of the postsynaptic receptors. These possibilities can be distinguished by a quantal analysis in which the size of the miniature excitatory postsynaptic potential released spontaneously from the presynaptic terminal is used as a reference. By means of microcultures, in which single sensory and motor neurons of Aplysia were plated together, miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials attributable to the spontaneous release of single transmitter quanta from individual presynaptic neurons were recorded and used to analyze long-term facilitation induced by repeated applications of 5-hydroxytryptamine. The results indicate that the facilitation is caused by an increase in the number of transmitter quanta released by the presynaptic neuron.\r"

  ".W": "By means of a selective DNA amplification technique called polymerase chain reaction, proviral sequences of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) were identified directly in DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of persons seropositive but not in DNA isolated from PBMCs of persons seronegative for the virus. Primer pairs from multiple regions of the HIV-1 genome were used to achieve maximum sensitivity of provirus detection. HIV-1 sequences were detected in 100% of DNA specimens from seropositive, homosexual men from whom the virus was isolated by coculture, but in none of the DNA specimens from a control group of seronegative, virus culture-negative persons. However, HIV-1 sequences were detected in 64% of DNA specimens from seropositive, virus culture-negative homosexual men. This method of DNA amplification made it possible to obtain results within 3 days, whereas virus isolation takes up to 3 to 4 weeks. The method may therefore be used to complement or replace virus isolation as a routine means of determining HIV-1 infection.\r"

  ".U": "88099525\r", 
  ".W": "Lambert-Eaton syndrome, an autoimmune disorder frequently associated with small-cell carcinoma of the lung, is characterized by impaired evoked release of acetylcholine from the motor nerve terminal. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies from patients with the syndrome, applied to bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, reduced the voltage-dependent calcium channel currents by about 40 percent. When calcium was administered directly into the cytoplasm, however, the IgG-treated cells exhibited normal exocytotic secretion, as assayed by membrane capacitance measurement. Measurement with the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2 indicated that the IgG treatment reduced potassium-stimulated increase in free intracellular calcium concentration. The pathogenic IgG modified neither kinetics of calcium channel activation nor elementary channel activity, suggesting that a reduction in the number of functional calcium channels underlies the IgG-induced effect. Therefore, Lambert-Eaton syndrome IgG reacts with voltage-dependent calcium channels and blocks their function, a phenomenon that can account for the presynaptic impairment characteristic of this disorder.\r"

In the office and clinic it is even more common, since many patients can be treated medically and do not require an operation. To be significant, a discharge should be true, spontaneous, persistent, and nonlactational. Nipple discharge can be milky, multicolored and sticky, purulent, clear (watery), yellow (serous), pink (serosanguineous), or bloody (sanguineous). Watery, serous, serosanguineous, and sanguineous discharges are surgically significant; while they are most often caused by intraductal papillomas or fibrocystic disease, they can be due to cancer or a precancerous mastopathy. Among 503 patients operated on for one of these types of discharge, 67 (13.3%) had cancer, and 36 (7.2%) had a precancerous mastopathy. Among the 67 patients with cancer, eight (11.9%) had no palpable mass, 11 (16.4%) had negative cytologic findings, and seven (10.4%) had a negative mammogram. The incidence of associated cancers increases when the discharge is, in order of increasing frequency, serous, serosanguineous, sanguineous, or watery, when it is accompanied by a lump, when it is unilateral and from a single duct, when there are positive cytologic or mammographic findings, and when the patient is more than 50 years of age. Milky discharge caused by galactorrhea is treated medically except when caused by a pituitary adenoma. Multicolored sticky discharge due to duct ectasia is also treated medically except in advanced cases. Purulent discharge caused by an abscess requires drainage and a biopsy of the abscess wall. Except in women less than 30 years of age of in those anxious to have children, we advise a complete central duct excision for patients with surgically significant types of discharge. If done carefully, this procedure can yield good cosmetic results.\r"

In 24 of the 36, there were three or more associated major disease processes, such as chronic bronchitis, hypertensive cardiovascular disease, aortic valve disease, cerebrovascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and coronary artery disease. Eight patients with acute type A (ascending aorta) and seven with acute type B (descending aorta) aneurysms had emergency repair, with survival in four and seven, respectively. All patients with chronic type A or B aneurysms had elective repair, and all patients with acute or chronic type A aneurysms had surgical treatment. Four patients with acute type A and two with acute type B aneurysms had elective operation, with survival in three and one, respectively. Nine patients with chronic type A and six with chronic type B aneurysms had elective operation, and all survived. Twelve patients with chronic type B aneurysms did not have operation, and all were alive at early follow-up. Mortality for patients having acute type A aneurysms requiring emergency operation was greater than that after elective repair of acute or chronic type A aneurysms. Short-term survival for chronic type B aneurysms was similar whether the patient was treated medically or surgically.\r"

Symptoms consistent with appendicitis were documented on the initial visit in each case, but 22 patients had a history of previous similar pain or recent viral illness to confuse the diagnosis. Misdiagnosis was responsible for the delay in 14 cases (gastroenteritis in ten and urinary tract infection in four). Antibiotics given before proper diagnosis in 22 instances increased diagnostic difficulty in 20. Late referral is increasing, perhaps because of a perceived innocuous nature of appendicitis. Complicated appendicitis was found in 26 children (81%), compared with 38% of the total experience. Their hospital stay averaged nine days, as opposed to 6.6 days in the nondelayed group. Failure of resolution of symptoms after therapy begins mandates reassessment to avoid progression of this common surgical disease.\r"

The odds that injury victims were black were 1.84:1 as compared to control subjects. For victims of accidents only, the odds ratio for low birth weight was 2.37, and for black race, 1.61. For victims of homicide, the odds ratio for low birth weight was 6.15, and for black race, 4.76. Male sex, high birth order, low Apgar score, and the presence of a congenital anomaly were not significant infant risk factors by multifactorial analyses.\r"

Patients with calculi of various sizes were treated and compared for (1) length of hospitalization, (2) ancillary procedures, (3) repeat ESWL, (4) obstructive complications, (5) parenteral analgesic requirements, and (6) stone-free rate. Patients were grouped according to calculus length. Group A consisted of 76 patients with calculi totaling less than 3 cm. Group B contained 24 patients with calculi totaling more than 3 cm. In group A, 96% required a single ESWL procedure. Hospitalization averaged two days, and none had obstructive complications; 33% required no parenteral analgesics. In group B, 58% received a single ESWL treatment, whereas 88% required ancillary procedures. Results showed extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy to be effective treatment of urinary calculi measuring less than 3 cm. Larger calculi required combinations of ESWL with other endourologic treatment.\r"

Other prognostic variables independent for the number of positive nodes were the favorable survival in patients with primary melanoma on the calf, and the adverse survival effect of extranodal melanoma at node dissection or recurrent metastases within the node dissection region. Factors that did not predict survival after the development of regional node disease were the age, sex, and race of the patient; location of the primary melanoma other than calf; immediate versus delayed node dissection; adjuvant treatment after node dissection; and the development of regional in-transit cutaneous metastases. Metastasis to regional nodes as a harbinger of disseminated disease was reflected in the 33% five-year and 28% ten-year survivals calculated from the date of node dissection.\r"

Function of the extremity and relief of pain were each graded as excellent, good, fair, or poor using a modification of Perez's rating system. Seven pathologic fractures were treated nonoperatively. These patients generally had only fair pain relief and a poor functional result. Forty-six pathologic fractures were treated with intramedullary fixation using a Rush rod (n = 16), a Kuntscher rod (n = 29), or an Ender rod (n = 1); the Neer endoprosthesis was used in four patients. Thirty-one patients received radiation to the humerus. There were seven operative complications, the most common (n = 3) being prominence of an intramedullary rod at the insertion site which required a second minor procedure for advancement of the rod. From this series, we conclude that any patient who has a pathologic fracture or impending fracture of the humerus and a predicted survival of six weeks or more is likely to benefit from rigid internal fixation with an appropriately selected device, adjunctive use of methylmethacrylate, and postoperative local irradiation therapy as needed.\r"

The results of prior reports have suggested that a failed distal bypass may convert a lower extremity amputation to a higher level than afforded by primary amputation. We reviewed all distal, tibial or peroneal artery bypasses performed at our institution during the period of March 1980 through October 1986. Fifty-three patients with 59 threatened lower extremities underwent distal bypass for salvage of the limb. No patient was excluded from review. Thirty-eight patients in the study group had diabetes, and 41 had a prior smoking history. In the postoperative period, six patients were lost to follow-up study, nine patients died, with follow-up data complete in 47 of the study group. The maximum length of follow-up study was 78 months, and the average length was 24 months. Data were examined by life table analysis with respect to cumulative salvage of the limb and graft patency. During the period of review, 12 major amputations were required (nine below-knee and three above-knee) for a cumulative salvage rate of 59 per cent. Of the distal grafts which failed (n = 27), three of 27 of the limbs required above-knee amputation. We conclude that a failed tibial or peroneal artery bypass does not preclude the possibility of salvage of the limb and does not predispose to a subsequent amputation.\r"

This study was done to compare the stimulatory action of neurotensin on pancreatic exocrine secretion in conscious dogs to those of secretin and cholecystokinin (CCK). Six dogs with chronic pancreatic and gastric fistulas were given hydrochloric acid intraduodenally or CCK-8 intravenously to produce maximal bicarbonate or protein secretion. Neurotensin was then given intravenously in combination with intraduodenal hydrochloric acid or intravenous CCK-8. Incremental bicarbonate outputs in response to intraduodenal hydrochloric acid alone were measured and compared with intraduodenal hydrochloric acid plus intravenous neurotensin. Intravenous administration of neurotensin augmented pancreatic bicarbonate and protein secretory responses to a maximal dose of intraduodenal hydrochloric acid. Incremental protein responses to intravenous CCK-8 alone were measured and compared to intravenous CCK-8 plus intravenous neurotensin. Incremental bicarbonate responses to intravenous CCK-8 alone were compared with intravenous CCK-8 plus intravenous neurotensin. Similarly, intravenous neurotensin augmented pancreatic protein and bicarbonate secretory responses to a maximal dose of intravenous CCK-8. The results of this study indicate that neurotensin may stimulate pancreatic secretion of protein and bicarbonate by mechanisms which are different from those of CCK and secretin. Neurotensin apparently exerts its action through specific neurotensin receptors.\r"

Over-all cumulative patency rate for all grafts was 76 per cent at 12 months, 50 per cent at 36 months and 40 per cent at 60 months. Forearm grafts of loop configuration yielded greater over-all patency rates and required fewer revisions than forearm grafts of straight configuration. Graft thrombosis was the universal indicator of graft malfunction. In the instance of a malfunction, immediate thrombectomy followed by angiography was considered essential to decisions regarding further therapy. Of 95 grafts that malfunctioned, 49 ultimately required revision, extending the survival to a rate equaling that of continuously functioning grafts. Extensive venous stenosis limiting outflow and multiple intragraft stenosis were the main causes of graft failure. For patients in whom all vessels of the upper extremity had been exhausted, thigh grafts of the loop configuration and axilloaxillary grafts proved to be satisfactory alternatives. Although PTFE grafts are not the final solution for vascular access in hemodialysis, in many instances, they will serve well, provided the surgeon gives proper consideration to their most efficacious use.\r"

The results of investigations we did, both clinically and in an animal model, revealed the development of an intense vascular network in the region of the arteriovenous anastomosis as an important component of the revascularization process. To determine the role of ischemia in this process, four groups consisting of three dogs each underwent a popliteal artery to vein anastomosis. In group I, there was no ischemia; group II, distal ischemia only; group III, partial ischemia, and group IV, total ischemia. Angiography at four weeks in all dogs demonstrated that the intense neovascular network seen in previous studies developed only in the limbs of the dogs in group IV. We conclude that the neovascular process seen after creation of arteriovenous reversal develops as a response to severe ischemia. Further studies are needed to better characterize the nature of these vessels, and it is our hope that, in doing so, means of enhancing development of these vessels in order to indirectly revascularize otherwise unsalvagable extremities will be realized.\r"

Twenty-eight patients had excellent continence, while 22 had episodic minor incontinence. The maximum resting pressure in the anal canal was reduced in patients with episodic incontinence compared with continent patients and control volunteers. The increase in pressure with squeeze was slightly greater in continent than in incontinent patients. The frequency of the anal slow waves was less after IAA than in control volunteers and the amplitude of the waves was greater. The frequency and amplitude, however, were not related to continence or resting pressure. In conclusion, decreased anal canal resting and squeeze pressures after ileal pouch to anal anastomosis are associated with episodic minor incontinence, while altered motility patterns in the anal canal are not.\r"

Beyond this, the distribution of MTC is different than in North America. In patients we studied, we were able to predict the correct histopathologic diagnosis 80 per cent of the time by considering the history of the patient and the results of a conventional roentgenogram of the chest. This was increased to 91.4 per cent when needle biopsy was added. Optimal therapy for MTC is complete surgical resection.

  ".W": "Current staging protocols for carcinoma of the breast do not contain precise definitions for cancers detected as suspicious mammographic findings only. We have examined the distribution of malignant lesions and the frequency of metastasis to the axillary nodes and multicentricity in 1,059 women who have undergone 1,132 biopsies of the breast for nonpalpable lesions in order to determine if nonpalpable carcinomas should be categorized and staged separately from those detected in the traditional manner. Of these 1,132 biopsies, 29.1 per cent (330) were malignant, including 190 invasive ductal carcinomas, 13 invasive lobular carcinomas, 81 in situ ductal carcinomas, 25 microinvasive ductal carcinomas, 20 instances of lobular carcinoma in situ and one instance of malignant carcinoid. None of the women with noninvasive or microinvasive carcinomas had axillary metastasis; however, of 167 women with invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma who underwent axillary dissection, 32.9 per cent had at least one positive axillary node. In those women in whom the invasive carcinomas presented as clustered calcifications, the likelihood of axillary metastasis was the same as in the women who had nonpalpable masses. The significant frequency of axillary metastasis in women with clinically occult cancers challenges the use of the term \"minimal\" to describe any invasive cancer, regardless of size. Although noninvasive and microinvasive ductal cancers may continue to be considered as \"minimal,\" invasive cancers, regardless of presentation, should be staged according to their measured size on the mammograms that detect them.\r"

Resection of the tumor was carried out in all of the patients. Extensive resection of the liver with resection of the regional vascular structures was done in six. Another six underwent resection of the liver without resection of the regional vascular structures. The remaining patient underwent resection of the tumor and of the regional revascular structures alone. Vascular resection included resection and reconstruction of both the portal vein and hepatic artery in four patients or only of the portal vein in three. Biliary drainage was carried out by intrahepatic cholangiojejunostomies between segmental hepatic ducts and a Roux-en-Y loop. Two patients died and ten are alive. The quality of postoperative life is satisfactory and the patients are free of sequelae and symptoms secondary to operation or disease. This approach is recommended for the management of a number of patients with bilateral vascular or biliary involvement secondary to primary cholangiocarcinoma of the porta hepatis. For those patients, this approach offers a promising alternative.\r"

At the same time, single needle electromyography of the external sphincter muscle was recorded. An uneventful recovery was found in all patients. This was confirmed by restoration of the anal pressures of voluntary and involuntary control within low to low normal limits indicating an almost complete anatomic recovery of the anal sphincter complex. Three patients had complaints of incontinence. These complaints were often neglected by both the obstetrician and patient.

Four sham operated dogs showed minimal hemodynamic response. A dual mechanism for the hepatic hemodynamic consequences of chronic biliary obstruction is suggested: Decreased HA blood flow associated with diminished blood pressure and reduced PV blood flow resulting from raised intrahepatic PV vascular resistance.\r"

Three of these patients had undergone an appendectomy, while in the remaining four patients, the history and physical findings were atypical of acute appendicitis. CT findings suggestive of acute diverticulitis including thickening of the intestinal wall and pericolonic inflammation were present in all seven patients. In four patients, the colonic inflammation was limited to the segment of ascending colon superior to the ileocecal valve. In one patient, the inflammation involved both the ascending colon and the cecum, while in the two remaining patients, the inflammatory changes were limited to the cecum. An associated diverticular abscess was present in five patients and all were correctly identified preoperatively by CT. One patient in whom the diagnosis of uncomplicated diverticulitis of the ascending colon was made on the basis of the CT scan, was successfully managed nonoperatively with antibiotics. Five patients required a right hemicolectomy for perforated diverticulitis with abscess. The remaining patient underwent a right hemicolectomy for recurrent episodes of acute diverticulitis. Our experience suggests that CT is useful in the early diagnosis of diverticulitis of the cecum and ascending colon.\r"

The tumors were located intradurally and extracerebrally and were firmly attached to the dura mater at the base of the middle fossa. Glial fibrillary acidic protein stain was negative, and histologic examination suggested a diagnosis of bilateral fibrous xanthoma. Postoperative CT scan showed residual tumors and an enlarged choroid plexus adjacent to it. A CT scan at 12 years of age showed no enhanced tumor, but disclosed bitemporal high-density areas and diffuse brain atrophy; the choroid plexus reverted to normal size. The patient showed mental and physical retardation, perhaps owing to the compression of the hypothalamus during early childhood. This would appear to be the first known case of bilateral intracranial fibrous xanthoma.\r"

The five other patients were considered inoperable, because they showed signs of compression of the caudal brainstem.

The level associated with the largest killed end potential was clearly determined without much difficulty, with sequential recordings on stepwise withdrawal of the recording electrode, in four of five cases investigated. In two cases subjected to surgery, the recording electrode left in place at the level associated with the largest killed end potential was found to be located at, or a few millimeters below, the center of the lesions.

Axonal regeneration across allografts in cyclosporin A-treated animals was satisfactory, but it occurred more slowly and with more inflammation and fibrosis than in autografts. Without immunosuppression, fresh allografts were rejected. However, in immunocompetent hosts, allografts rendered less immunogenic by predegeneration were not rejected, and axonal regeneration occurred. The combination of cyclosporin A and nerve graft predegeneration produced the most substantial axonal regeneration, comparable to autografts. The observations suggest that nerve allograft survival may be optimally effected by cyclosporin A treatment coupled with reduction in the immunogenicity of the grafts, such as by predegeneration.\r"

  ".W": "In the belief that recurrences will be lower if all defects are repaired at the original operation, I performed a Cooper's ligament repair on all groin hernias in adult patients between 1959 and 1984, regardless of the hernia type. This series includes 1142 repairs in 942 patients. Follow-up has been 97%, with 80% of the patients being personally examined by the author. Excluding late deaths, 906 repairs in 747 patients have been followed up for an average of 9 years. There have been 18 recurrences, for a recurrence rate of 2% of live repairs. This breaks down to 1.9% for 779 primary hernias and 2.4% for 127 recurrent hernias. In primary hernias only the recurrence rates are 3.5% for 289 direct hernias, 1.1% for 459 indirect hernias, and 0% for 31 femoral hernias. Seventeen of the 18 recurrences have been indirect along the cord in a subgroup of 147 repairs done with a subcutaneously transplanted cord and followed for an average of 17.4 years (recurrence rate, 11.6%). This method was discarded in 1972. There has been only one recurrence in 572 repairs with the cord left in the natural position and followed for an average of 7.1 years (recurrence rate, 0.2%). This shows the value of not superimposing the internal and external rings (90% confidence limits that the recurrence rate is less than 0.7%). There has been no recurrence in 154 repairs in female patients or 33 repairs with orchiectomy followed for 8.1 and 8.8 years, respectively. A Cooper's ligament repair gives a strong posterior wall and repairs all the defects that can occur in the groin. It can be done safely on all adult groin hernia patients, with a recurrence rate lower than those reported for selective methods of repair.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen multiple endocrine neoplasia type II (MEN II) gene carriers--12 who had undergone thyroidectomy because of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and 4 whose thyroid glands had been removed because of C cell hyperplasia--were examined for the presence of pheochromocytomas. No patient had sought medical advice for pheochromocytoma symptoms. Fourteen patients had MEN IIa syndromes, one patient had a MEN IIb and another patient had a mixed syndrome of von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis and MEN II. Eight patients had undergone unilateral adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma 11 +/- 4 years before. The patients underwent clinical examination, determination of the urinary excretion of catecholamines and metabolites, and 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) and CAT scans. 131I-MIBG scanning was performed with images 1, 4, and 7 days after the radionuclide injection. In seven of eight patients who had undergone unilateral adrenalectomies, the 131I-MIBG scans showed accumulation of the radionuclide in the remaining adrenal gland. Bilateral adrenal accumulation of the radionuclide was demonstrated in seven of eight MEN IIa gene carriers who had not undergone adrenalectomy. Five patients, two of whom had undergone adrenalectomy, were found to have unilateral pheochromocytomas less than 2 cm in diameter. Only one of these five patients had an elevated excretion of urinary catecholamines. Between day 4 and day 7 after 131I-MIBG injection, adrenal glands with pheochromocytomas increased their relative accumulation of the radionuclide significantly more (p less than 0.02) than did adrenal glands without any demonstrable pheochromocytomas. All the pheochromocytomas were viewed by means of CAT scans. Only one MEN IIa patient had bilateral pheochromocytomas, but our findings indicate that there is a tendency to bilateral adrenal medullary hyperfunction in most MEN II gene carriers. As 131I-MIBG and CAT scans can facilitate the early diagnosis of pheochromocytomas, unilateral adrenalectomy can safely be performed in most MEN IIa patients. Bilateral pheochromocytomas develop in a majority of patients with MEN IIb syndromes. Bilateral adrenalectomy should therefore be performed in these patients.\r"

Sixteen of the 21 prophylactic insertions were performed before total joint replacement in patients with a history of venous thromboembolism. Operative morbidity (4.6%) was minor and occurred only early in the series. The operative mortality rate was 4.6%. None of the deaths were related to filter insertion or pulmonary embolism. Follow-up in 65 patients (73.9%) ranged from 1 to 60 months (mean, 16.4 months). Leg edema developed in 9.2% (6/65), stasis ulceration in 3.1% (2/65), caval occlusion in 7.5% (3/40), and recurrent nonfatal embolism in 3.1% (2/65) of the patients. In the patients who received prophylactic filters before total joint replacement, there were no filter-related complications or episodes of pulmonary embolism. This series confirms the safety and effectiveness of the Greenfield filter and suggests that the indications for its use might be liberalized to include prophylactic insertion of the device in certain high-risk patients.\r"

Treatment consisted of separate percutaneous drainage of the portal and biliary tracts. Closure of the fistula was obtained by progressive proximal intrahepatic portal thrombosis. Our case contrasts with the four other cases of bilioportal fistula published in the literature in that (1) there was an absence of biliary lithiasis and (2) we did not use surgical treatment.

Duplex imaging of the veins of the lower extremities demonstrated no evidence of thrombosis, and no venous valves could be imaged. On phlebography, the patient was found to have no venous valves in the superficial and deep systems of the leg. We conclude that congenital absence of the venous valves of the lower extremities is almost certainly underdiagnosed and that the vascular laboratory can accurately and easily differentiate between lymphedema and venous valvular imcompetence. Such differentiation may have therapeutic implications.\r"

Wound strength and healing of BAR, suture, and staple colonic anastomoses were compared for intervals of up to 1 year. The effect of systemic steroid treatment and BAR size on anastomotic wound strength and healing was also studied. The BARs fragmented at a mean time of 15.06 days postoperatively and were passed in the feces without injury. Wound strength was determined by measurements of the pressure required to burst the anastomosed colonic segment and measurements of the tension required to break 10 mm wide longitudinal strips of the anastomosed segment. The studies demonstrated that wound strength had progressed to a point where continued mechanical support (with sutures or staples) was no longer required by 14 days in both nontreated and steroid-treated dogs. Gross healing evaluations at 21 days and beyond showed no differences due to anastomotic method. Microscopic evaluations suggested that residual granulation tissue was less at the sites of BAR asastomoses than at sites of suture or staple anastomoses at the 1-year interval, suggesting that healing may be better with BAR than with standard methods of colon anastomosis.\r"

In a previous study we tested a diaphragm pump in our pneumatically driven ATS that met these requirements. In this study a centrifugal pump was used as an outflow pump in otherwise the same system. A centrifugal pump has important advantages: It prevents the occurrence of massive air embolism, accidental obstruction of the outflow line will not cause bursting of the tubing, and there is no spallation. There are also indications that a centrifugal pump causes less stimulation of the coagulation cascade than do other pumps. Because of these advantages, we were interested in the hemocompatibility and pumping characteristics of the centrifugal pump in our ATS. From this study we conclude that the hemocompatibility of the centrifugal pump was not significantly different from that of the previously tested diaphragm pump. Also, the system can easily and safely be operated by non-specialized personnel. Because of the advantages, especially in pumping characteristics, the centrifugal pump is our choice in on-line ATSs.\r"

  ".W": "Growth of neomucosa has been investigated as a means to increase intestinal surface area in the short-bowel syndrome. Functional neomucosa grows over patched intestinal defects, but the effect of the patching procedure on absorption is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine morphologic and nutritional responses to intestinal patching after resection. Fifteen dogs (13 to 19 kg) underwent either 75% resection of the small intestine (control group, n = 5), simultaneous resection and patching of the intestinal remnant with colon serosa (simultaneous group, n = 5), or resection with patching 12 weeks later (delayed group, n = 5). Caloric intake was standard in the three groups. Animals were killed 40 weeks after resection or patching. At that time, defects were 95% covered with neomucosa in both patched groups. Intestinal remnant length increased significantly in controls (139 +/- 20% initial length) compared to the simultaneous group (99 +/- 6%, p less than 0.05) but not to the delayed group (119 +/- 11%). Villous height of intestinal mucosa was greater in the control and delayed groups than in the simultaneous group (714 +/- 36 and 624 +/- 111 versus 535 +/- 54 micron, p less than 0.05). Fasting gastrin levels were significantly greater in patched animals than after resection alone (p less than 0.05). Intestinal transit by barium meal was significantly longer in patched animals (18 +/- 7 minutes versus 11 +/- 6, p less than 0.05). Body weight and serum albumin level were significantly lower in patched animals at death. Fecal weight, moisture, and fat excretion were significantly increased in the simultaneous group. Although intestinal patching results in the growth of neomucosa and prolonged transit time, it has a deleterious effect on absorption and nutritional status. In part, this may be related to inhibition of intestinal adaptation and gastric hypersecretion in patched animals.\r"

  ".W": "Despite sufficient iodine supply, goiter continues to be of considerable surgical significance in formerly endemic countries. It now appears that iodine deficiency and increased thyrotropin stimulation are not the only causes of goiter. Xenotransplantation of human thyroid tissue onto nude mice allowed study of the regulation of growth and function in human goiter tissue. Grafts of human thyroid tissue growing in nude mice could be shown to react to endogenous mouse thyrotropic stimulation and suppression. 131I autoradiographs of xenotransplanted goiter tissue showed as marked a heterogeneity as did the original goitrous tissue prior to transplantation. There was no firm correlation between the morphologic appearance of a follicle and its iodine metabolism. Scintigraphically \"cold\" and \"hot\" goiter tissue differed from each other quantitatively but not qualitatively; i.e., both \"hot\" and \"cold\" tissue were composed of metabolically active and nonactive follicles. Iodine organification was not completely suppressible by thyroxine treatment; this indicates autonomous functional activity. The distribution of proliferating tissue labeled by 3-H-thymidine did not parallel the distribution of functionally active tissue labelled by 131I. Thyroxine treatment did not completely inhibit 3-H-thymidine incorporation, indicating autonomous growth. Thus, our pathogenetic concept of goiter formation is based on three mainstays: (1) goiter heterogeneity, (2) autonomy of growth and function, and (3) dissociation of growth and function in human goiter tissue. Thus, the surgeon dealing with goiter ought to remove all pathologically altered tissue, i.e., nodular tissue, irrespective of its appearance on scintiscans.\r"

The principal finding was an increase in the rate of CO2 production of 11.9 +/- 5.0% after surgery. This corresponds to a 267 +/- increase in energy expenditure (p less than 0.05). No trauma-associated change in energy expenditure was found with the MMC. The correlation of preoperative values from MMC and DLW was not statistically significant (r = 0.25), nor was the correlation of MMC and the Harris-Benedict equation, but the correlation of DLW with Harris-Benedict equation was statistically significant (r = 0.73, p less than 0.05).

During follow-up (mean 48 months), occlusion of the internal carotid artery developed without symptoms in two patients and with symptoms in three patients. The cumulative stroke and/or death rate was 24% at 2 years and 50% at 6 years. The ipsilateral infarct rate was 10% after the first year, but decreased markedly thereafter (2.4% per year), and one third of these infarcts were probably lacunes due to hypertensive small vessel disease. Overall, stroke related to previously symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis was not the major problem during follow-up but was largely overcome by other strokes and cardiac death.\r"

Vertebral artery occlusion has often been associated with a benign course, but under certain circumstances embolism to the basilar artery may complicate the outcome.\r"

In elderly patients with thyrotoxicosis, atrial fibrillation is frequently encountered, and the true risk of cerebrovascular events in these patients is controversial. We retrospectively studied 610 patients with initially untreated thyrotoxicosis, 91 (14.9%) of whom had atrial fibrillation, with the highest frequency in the elderly patients. The risk of cerebrovascular events, with special attention to the first year after the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis, was calculated using logistic regression methods with age, sex, and atrial fibrillation as independent variables. Only age was an important risk factor (p less than 0.005), whereas sex and atrial fibrillation were not significant (p = 0.09 and p = 0.17, respectively) as independent risk factors. This is contrary to other studies of patients with thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation, and the need for further clarification of this issue is clear. From our study the indication for prophylactic treatment with anticoagulants for prevention of stroke in thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation seems doubtful, especially as no controlled studies of such treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation are currently available.\r"

  ".W": "The spatial correlation of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) may improve our ability to identify ischemic brain lesions and may provide further insight into the pathophysiology of early cerebral ischemia. Eleven pentobarbital-anesthetized adult cats underwent exposure of the common carotid arteries bilaterally and the right middle cerebral artery through a transorbital approach. Baseline NMRI images were obtained with a single spin-echo, multislice technique using a 0.6-T field, 0.4-cm slice thickness, and a surface coil. Focal ischemia was produced with right middle cerebral artery occlusion and potentiated with bilateral common carotid artery ligation. Sequential NMRI studies were then performed at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours or until CBF was determined in the same cats using [14C]iodoantipyrine at either 2 (n = 2), 4 (n = 2), 6 (n = 2), or 12 (n = 1) hours after the time of occlusion. This protocol allowed temporal and spatial correlation of NMRI and CBF. Alternate 5-mm brain slices were incubated with 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) for 45 minutes at 37-41 degrees C and frozen in liquid Freon for later autoradiographic CBF determination. Four cats were studied only with NMRI and TTC (not CBF). The correlation between areas of increased NMRI signal intensity observed in T2-weighted images (repetition time 2,000 msec, echo time 120 msec), vital staining with TTC, low CBF, and routine histology was evaluated. During the early phase (less than 6 hours), T2-weighted NMRI changes were localized to the central ischemic gray matter areas, as defined in the later CBF images, with no involvement of the white matter. By the twelfth hour the NMRI changes involved the entire ischemic area including gray and white matter. The initial visible changes seen on T2-weighted NMRI are suggestive of cellular edema, and the later changes are characteristic of vasogenic edema. The spread of NMRI changes compared with the ischemic area determined from autoradiographic CBF is consistent with the previously described biphasic evolution of ischemic injury. These data suggest that T2-weighted NMRI could be used clinically to delineate areas of acute ischemic stroke.\r"

In particular, the reduction is more pronounced in the left hemisphere in case of both right and left carotid ligature. The greater receptor decrease in the left side of the brain was shown to depend on the integrity of interhemispheric connections. We show that the changes in capillary beta-adrenergic receptors in response to unilateral carotid occlusion are qualitatively modified during aging. In particular, the asymmetry in the response pattern observed in young rats is lost. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon may be based on an age-related impairment in the transfer of neuronal information between the two sides of the brain.\r"

Sixty-one patients (46%) had a history of CAD, and 16 of the 61 also had congestive heart failure (CAD-CHF). Patients with CAD, and especially those with CAD-CHF, had significantly longer intervals from stroke onset to rehabilitation admission (p less than 0.001), and once in rehabilitation they experienced three times as many cardiac complications (p less than 0.001). While all patient groups improved function during rehabilitation, those with CAD and CAD-CHF improved significantly less than did those without CAD (p less than 0.01). Patients with CAD did least well with rolling, moving in bed, transferring from a wheelchair to bed, and walking. CHF not only adversely influenced overall function and mobility task performance but also affected the potential for achieving functional gains. These data suggest that specific measures of function and rehabilitation are affected by CAD and that the levels of achievement for patients with CAD-CHF are limited.\r"

Massive ganglionic hemorrhage decreased, while small or medium-sized intracerebral hemorrhage increased in the recent cohort on pathologic or computed tomographic examination. These trends could be due to the reduced prevalence of hypertension in the Hisayama population. The association of serum total cholesterol with intracerebral hemorrhage is discussed based on the results during a 22-year follow-up period.\r"

Intraventricular hemorrhage was noted by computed tomography in 10; five of these emanated from the caudate nucleus. A localized hematoma without intraventricular hemorrhage was found in two. All 13 angiograms had smokelike basal anastomoses with various degrees of stenosis or occlusion of the anterior portion of the circle of Willis; the involvement was bilateral in 12 and unilateral in one. Aneurysms were found in two patients, one in the anterior communicating artery and the other in the left anterior choroidal artery. Eleven patients recovered from the initial stroke, but two died with recurrent hemorrhage. This series differs from the series reported in Japan by the predominance of adult males. The high incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and intracerebral hematoma is not in keeping with the previous Chinese series, in which subarachnoid hemorrhage was suspected to be the major clinical manifestation.\r"

  ".W": "Antifibrinolytic drugs reduce the risk of rebleeding during the first 2 weeks after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, they do not lower overall mortality, largely because of an increased incidence of cerebral ischemia. The usefulness of antifibrinolytic drugs might be increased if a method to prevent or control vasospasm in patients were to be developed. We recently completed late Phase I and Phase II studies of the calcium ion blocking drug nicardipine in 67 patients treated within 1 week of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Of these 67 patients, 42 had delayed operations and were treated concomitantly with the antifibrinolytic drug aminocaproic acid (1.5 g/hr) for an average of 6 days before surgery. The outcome of these 42 patients is the subject of this report. Fifteen of 42 patients were treated with the lower dosage levels of nicardipine (0.4-4.5 mg/m2/hr), and 27 patients were treated at the highest dosage level (6.0 mg/m2/hr). Using the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons scale for subarachnoid hemorrhage, at admission 18 patients were Grade I, 15 were Grade II, 6 were Grade III, and 3 were Grade IV. Five patients (12%) developed clinical signs of deterioration suggestive of cerebral ischemia with concomitant evidence of vasospasm on arteriography. These patients were all treated with hypervolemic hypertensive therapy. Only one patient (2%) developed an infarction from vasospasm. Two patients developed symptomatic hydrocephalus requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunting, and a third patient required a temporary ventriculostomy. The 3-month postoperative outcomes were excellent. Three patients (7%) rebled. Three patients died, two from rebleeding of the aneurysm and one who never regained consciousness from the initial hemorrhage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
