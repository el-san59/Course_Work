To characterize such aberrations sonographically, longitudinal crown-rump length measurements were made in a group of 20 control and 20 diabetic pregnancies. The study evaluated growth between 40 and 100 days of amenorrhea. The best-fit curve of growth as a function of gestational age was that of a nonlinear polynomial regression curve for both the control and the diabetic groups. The correlation coefficients were 0.997 and 0.887 for the control and diabetic groups, respectively; the standard error of the estimate was 0.054 and 0.19, respectively. A log10 linear transformation was performed successfully on each curve. Comparison of the slopes and the intercepts of the transformed control and diabetic curves revealed no significant differences. To evaluate the possibility of a transient fetal growth delay, interval growths and interval growth velocities were compared between groups. No significant differences were observed. The control and diabetic groups' mean (+/- SD) growth velocities were 0.043 +/- 0.023 and 0.040 +/- 0.022 mm/day/mm total, respectively (p = NS). The growth of two anomalous fetuses in the diabetic group was studied individually. Their growth characteristics could not be distinguished from the control fetuses' growth profiles. The present study fails to confirm the presence of early fetal growth delay in diabetic pregnancies. Moreover, the data suggest that the fetuses' early growth in the mother with poorly controlled diabetes is similar to that of control fetuses.\r"

Each examination consisted of measurements of the secondary yolk sac diameter and the fetal crown-rump length. The yolk sac was seen in all cases, and whereas its measurements demonstrated wide biologic variability, it correlated weakly (R2 = 0.39) with gestational age as confirmed by crown-rump length measurements. Growth of the yolk sac diameter, although slight, assumed a curvilinear relationship with gestational age. Such a growth profile is best described by a second-degree polynomial regression equation. The yolk sac performs important functions for embryonic development during organogenesis and the remnant of the secondary yolk sac seen on ultrasonography is often considered to be a potential predictor of fetal outcome. Our findings indicate that the size of this remnant in pregnancies with normal karyotypes and normal fetal outcomes is extremely variable. Additionally, the yolk sac size in patients with karyotypic abnormalities and spontaneous abortion were equally variable and almost all were within the normal range. In light of these findings, the secondary yolk sac size does not appear to be a sensitive predictor of embryonic integrity and pregnancy outcome.\r"

In this study a sensitive, monoclonal-based radioimmunoassay for alpha-fetoprotein was used to determine whether such an association also applies to the first trimester and if maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening could successfully detect a significant number of pregnancies in which the fetus had a trisomy or other chromosome disorder. Sera were obtained prospectively from 540 women just before chorionic villus sampling for prenatal diagnosis of chromosome defects (largely because of advanced maternal age) at 8 to 12 weeks' fetal age and assayed for alpha-fetoprotein under code without knowledge of the cytogenetic results. Eight of 27 (29.6%) of all serious chromosome defects were associated with low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values (less than or equal to 0.6 multiples of the median). Overall, 59 of 540 patients (10.9%) had maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values less than or equal to 0.6 multiples of the median, eight of whom had a fetus with a serious chromosome defect. Women whose maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein value was less than or equal to 0.6 multiples of the median had one in eight odds of carrying a fetus with a trisomy and one in seven odds of the fetus having any serious chromosome defect. From this study of a group of women at higher risk, we conclude that first-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening for chromosome defects is feasible. A prospective study to determine detection efficiency is now required of a consecutive routine pregnancy population in whom gestational age is determined by menstrual dates as is usually the case in clinical practice.\r"

  ".U": "89047647\r", 
  ".W": "From our previous work, it appears that fetal development in the abnormal intrauterine milieu of a mother with diabetes results in impaired glucose tolerance in adult life. In adult Wistar rats that were the offspring of mildly or severely diabetic mothers, in vitro islet stimulation and in vivo insulin uptake studies were undertaken to distinguish between alterations in glucose sensitivity and insulin secretion at the B cell level and alterations in insulin sensitivity and uptake at the level of the peripheral tissues. Insulin output after glucose stimulation by isolated islets was lower than normal in the rats of mothers with mild diabetes and higher than normal in the animals of severely diabetic mothers, confirming the results of previous in vivo studies. Insulin binding by the liver was normal in both groups. Insulin uptake by the kidney was normal in rats with mildly diabetic mothers but was increased in rats of severely diabetic mothers, suggesting decreased uptake of insulin by the peripheral tissues. Impaired glucose tolerance in rats of mildly diabetic mothers, resulting from decreased responsiveness to glucose, is interpreted as a consequence of hyperactivity of these B cells during the intrauterine life. Impaired glucose tolerance in rats of severely diabetic mothers, associated with insulin hypersecretion and decreased insulin uptake by the peripheral tissues might result from intrauterine alterations of the peripheral receptor or postreceptor system induced by the abnormal intrauterine milieu. These data on experimental diabetes in the rat demonstrate that the maternal diabetic environment exerts a diabetogenic influence on the offspring.\r"

In a series of 98 consecutive cases of nondiabetic, nontraumatic proliferative vitreoretinopathy, anterior proliferation caused retinal detachment in 58 patients. Relaxation of circumferential traction created by anterior proliferation in the vitreous base and its contiguous surfaces is achieved by multiple radial incisions in the vitreous base and associated anterior retina is eliminated by incision of the displaced anterior and posterior hyaloid surfaces. The subsequent release of posterior traction and determination of residual traction by sequential fluid-air exchange before final tamponade with longer acting gas or silicone oil is described. Total retinal reattachment was achieved in 23 of 33 eyes (70%) with only posterior proliferation compared to 27 of 47 eyes (57%) with significant anterior proliferation. Retinal attachment posterior to the scleral buckle was achieved in 27 of 33 eyes (82%) and 37 of 47 eyes (79%), respectively. Although the success rate was less in eyes with anterior proliferation, the retinal reattachment rates in the two groups approached comparability as experience and understanding of the clinical significance increased.\r"

The adhesion of Hs 294T and MEL-24 cells was markedly increased (approximately 2 to 12-fold) after pretreatment of HEC monolayers for 6 hours with tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, or endotoxin. Smaller increases were noted with the cell lines RPMI 7951, HT 144, Malme-3M, MEL-2, and no significant increase was observed with MEL-5. Cytokine and endotoxin effects on melanoma-HEC adhesion were concentration- and time-dependent, with onset by 2 hours, peak at 6-8 hours and maintenance through 48 hours. Cytokine induction of increased HEC adhesiveness for melanoma cells was blocked by actinomycin-D or cycloheximide, suggesting the requirement for RNA and protein synthesis. Interaction of melanoma cells with subendothelial matrix did not appear to play a primary role because: 1) phase contrast and electron microscopy revealed direct contact between tumor cells and endothelial cells in standardized monolayer adhesion assays; 2) increased adhesion (rosette formation) of tumor cells to activated HEC was also observed after nonenzymatic resuspension of HEC, and 3) the matrix peptide GRGDSP partially blocked (approximately 45%) Hs 294T cell adhesion to subendothelial matrix, but had little or no effect on adhesion to activated HEC monolayers. Taken together, these data suggest that inducible HEC surface changes may mediate the adhesion of certain melanoma cells, thereby exerting an active influence over the metastatic process.\r"

  ".W": "Human Hanukah Factor (HuHF) is a trypsinlike serine protease associated with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Employing a radiolabeled RNA probe for the HuHF gene, cells containing HuHF mRNA in situ were detected in skin lesions from patients with a variety of reactive and neoplastic dermatoses including positive allergic contact dermatitis patch tests, lichen planus, erythrodermic psoriasis, Sezary syndrome, and poikilodermatous mycosis fungoides. The results were correlated with in situ studies of CTL/NK subsets as defined immunohistologically by a panel of monoclonal antibodies applied to sermiserial sections of the same tissue blocks used for the HuHF hybridizations. The results suggest that cytotoxic cells are present in each of these dermatoses, that they may be situated within either the epidermis or the dermis, and that they belong predominantly to the CTL subset because Leu-7+ or CD16+ cells (NK cells) were typically rare or absent. A variable proportion of cells expressed Leu-19 antigen (a marker for non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic cells); however, its rarity in several cases suggests that most of the HuHF+ cells identified in them belonged to the MHC-restricted, Leu-19- CTL subset. It is concluded that the correlation of molecular biologic and immunohistologic data will be a useful method for the further characterization of cytotoxic cell subsets in human dermatoses.\r"

  ".W": "The long chain form of polysialic acid characteristic of the low adhesive embryonic form of the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM is temporally and spatially expressed in developing kidney but undetectable in normal adult kidney. Therefore, this molecule represents a developmentally regulated antigen in kidney contrasted with neural tissue, where it is also detectable in the adult brain. This investigation of 25 Wilms' tumors comprising all different histologic types demonstrates expression of this molecule under conditions of malignant growth. Immunostaining was observed in Wilms' tumors with both a monoclonal anti-polysialic acid antibody and a polyclonal anti-NCAM polypeptide antiserum. Intense cell surface staining sensitive to endosialidases specifically hydrolyzing alpha 2,8 linked (poly)sialic acid was detectable in blastemal regions, and weaker, variable labeling was seen over tubules and glomeruloid bodies. The stroma was not stained. This is evidence indicating that Wilms' tumor originates from the embryonic equivalent of induced metanephrogenic mesenchyme. It seems unlikely however, that the stroma is derived from the blastema. The same high molecular mass broad band typical of the embryonic form of NCAM was revealed by immunoblot analysis of homogenates from Wilms' tumor as well as from embryonic kidney and brain. In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of mRNA for NCAM in all but stromal elements of Wilm's tumors. Thus, polysialic acid is present on NCAM and represents a new oncodevelopmental antigen in human kidney. Polysialic acid was greatly reduced or absent by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting in necrotic tumor areas.\r"

  ".W": "A culture technique for whole blood vessel wall that preserves an intact and regenerative endothelium has been developed. The retention of an intact endothelium allows careful observation of the tissue as it responds to culture conditions, responses that include a change of replication timing and the induction of particulate endocytosis. Complete and normal regeneration of the endothelium in explants has made possible evaluation of the differences between the regeneration of endothelial cell monolayers and regeneration of intima in vivo. From these comparisons it appears that the shorter induction time of endothelial migration and proliferation and the more rapid migration in endothelial cell monolayers are due to effects of the culture medium or plastic culture surface, while the higher than normal cell density found in the intima after wound recovery in vivo probably is due to the dynamics of the blood vessel itself. The ability to control cell-cell interactions on the cultured tissue has made possible the investigation of gap junction-mediated metabolic interactions in regenerating intima. Results indicate that the disruptive effects of intimal regeneration do not depend on or produce an obvious change in junction-mediated nucleotide transfer between endothelial cells.\r"

Recipient rats usually developed clinical signs of EAE 5 or 6 days after transfer. The EAE was characterized by the presence of a number of petechiae over the spinal cord. Immunohistochemical examination using OX27, a monoclonal antibody specific for RT1.Ac, revealed the localization of transferred F1 (RT1(1/c] cells in the LEW recipients (RT1(1]. Most of the inflammatory cells in the spinal cord lesions were stained positively for OX27, indicating that they were transferred cells. In mild EAE, more W3/25+ cells were found than OX8+ cells. OX8+ cells were predominant in severe EAE, however. Examination of the spleens of rats that developed EAE by OX27 staining revealed that transferred F1 cells gradually increased in number and reached a maximal level on days 5 and 6. In the spleens of rats that received irradiation and transfer but did not develop EAE, few transferred F1 cells were observed. In addition, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-anti-BrdU immunohistochemistry was employed to demonstrate that cell proliferation really takes place in the spleen. It was revealed that the spleens of the recipients of lethal irradiation and F1 cells contained many BrdU+ cells. Because rats given lethal irradiation alone had extremely few BrdU-positive cells in their spleens, labeled cells in the recipients of radiation and transfer originated from transferred F1 cells. Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that transferred cells previously activated in vitro undergo further proliferation in the lymphoid organs of recipients to bring about the development of EAE.\r"

  ".W": "Four human squamous carcinoma cell (SCC) lines (SCC-9, SCC-13, SCC-15, and SCC-25) were studied to characterize their relative ability to control proliferation and differentiation. These experiments were based on previous data that established that in normal human keratinocytes three distinct and sequential steps are involved in the integrated control of proliferation and differentiation: 1) reversible growth-arrest at a predifferentiation state, 2) irreversible loss of proliferative potential, and 3) terminal differentiation. The current results show that SCC can show changes in the culture conditions required to undergo reversible growth-arrest and SCC can express partial or complete defects in their ability to irreversibly growth-arrest or terminally differentiate. For example, SCC-9 and SCC-25 cannot irreversibly growth-arrest or terminally differentiate, SCC-13 can irreversibly growth-arrest but cannot terminally differentiate, and SCC-15 can irreversibly growth-arrest and terminally differentiate to a moderate extent. These results therefore extend previous data by establishing that the malignant transformation of human epithelial cells does not simply result from defects in the control of terminal differentiation but rather from a combination of complex defects in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation.\r"

Cells were examined by phase-contrast, fluorescence, and electron microscopy at various times (15 minutes to 24 hours) after ultraviolet irradiation (320-400 nm). DOTC localized selectively within the mitochondria, as shown by colocalized fluorescence with rhodamine 123 (R123). Photosensitization at 1 J/sq cm caused striking swelling of the mitochondrial matrix and disruption of the cristae, accompanied by loss of the ability of mitochondria to concentrate R123. These changes progressed during the first hour after irradiation, and then were followed by partial recovery of mitochondrial ultrastructure and function. At no time were other organelles seen to be affected. It appears that this selective, photosensitized alteration was a consequence of localized and partially reversible damage to the mitochondrial inner membrane. In contrast, exposure to 2-6 J/sq cm caused irreversible injury and necrosis.\r"

To determine whether eosinophil degranulation and extracellular MBP deposition occur in schistosomal lesions in human tissues, the authors performed an indirect immunofluorescence assay on sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from patients infected with Schistosoma mansoni. A total of 8 liver and 4 colon specimens from 12 patients were examined. In the liver, 22 eggs were observed; only 3 of these were not confined to granulomas, and none of these 3 demonstrated extracellular MBP deposition in close proximity to the eggs. The remaining 19 eggs were confined to granulomas and 12 showed extracellular MBP deposition either on the surface of or in close proximity to the eggs. In the colon, 90 eggs were observed; 87 were not confined to granulomas, and none of these had MBP deposited on them. The remaining three eggs were confined to granulomas and only one showed MBP deposition. Finally, intense extracellular MBP deposition was noted in granulomas in association with the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon. The results show that the helminthotoxic MBP is deposited on eggs in granulomas in human tissues and suggest that the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon is accounted for in part by deposition of eosinophil granule MBP.\r"

Since their sleep disturbances are usually secondary to medical, psychiatric, pharmacologic, or environmental causes, they should receive a thorough evaluation and differential diagnostic approach. Before prescribing a sedative-hypnotic, one should consider nonpharmacologic interventions and education about normal sleep changes due to aging. As a foundation for the judicious prescribing of sedative-hypnotics, the pharmacokinetic changes associated with aging are discussed.\r"

The subjects were 3,025 US Marine recruits who were followed for 12 weeks of training at Parris Island, South Carolina. Polymer and standard mesh insoles were systematically distributed in boots that were issued to members of odd and even numbered platoons. The most important finding was that an elastic polymer insole with good shock absorbency properties did not prevent stress reactions of bone during a 12-week period of vigorous physical training. To control for the confounding effects of running in running shoes, which occurred for about one and one-half hours per week for the first five weeks, we also examined the association of age of shoes and cost of shoes with injury incidence. A slight trend of increasing stress injuries by increasing age of shoes was observed. However, this trend did not account for the similarity of rates in the two insole groups. In addition, we observed a strong trend of decreasing stress injury rate by history of increasing physical activity, as well as a higher stress injury rate in White compared to Black recruits. The results of the trial were not altered after controlling for these factors. This prospective study confirms previous clinical reports of the association of stress fractures with physical activity history. The clinical application of a shock absorbing insole as a preventive for lower extremity stress reactions is not supported in these uniformly trained recruits. The findings are relevant to civilian populations.\r"

Five of the 28 patients had chronic depressions of the posterolateral tibial plateau after initial treatment elsewhere. All five were disabled because of significant functional instability when the knee was in flexion. There were 23 acute fractures, of which 4 were initially nondisplaced and treated nonoperatively. One nonoperative patient was lost to followup; the remaining three were rated as having had good or excellent results. Nineteen patients had acute depressed fractures and were treated operatively with open reduction, elevation of the depressed area, and bone grafting, with or without internal fixation. All patients treated operatively at the time of injury were seen for followup from 24 to 145 months postoperatively, with a mean followup of 59 months. One patient was lost to followup; the other 18 were rated using both objective and subjective criteria. Seventeen (94%) achieved a final rating of excellent or good; one patient (6%) achieved a rating of fair. We have observed these fractures occurring in a younger population and producing significant disability in activities requiring a stable knee in flexion. The depressed posterolateral tibial plateau fracture is best assessed by AP, lateral, and 45 degrees internal oblique views on radiographic examination. Because of continued disability caused by chronic, depressed fractures of this type, we recommend open reduction and bone grafting in acute cases to eliminate instability in flexion. This procedure produces good or excellent results in most cases.\r"

Four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (2H12.B4,2H8.E10, 1H4.B6, and 4C12.G4) against the 95 kDa protein reacted with the vesicles of CVC and vesicles scattered in the cytoplasm of the infected erythrocytes. Two other MAbs (4C12.B10 and 4D7.B1) against a 28 kDa protein reacted with the cytoplasmic clefts and were also reactive with the vesicles and electron dense materials in parasitophorous vacuole. These parasite-induced structures make a contribution to the movement of some malaria proteins from the parasite to the erythrocyte surface.\r"

When the infiltration of these cells became more pronounced, the serum antibody titer began to increase. At the same time, deposits of IgM, IgG, and C3 were found in the glomeruli of the kidney. A number of eggs were observed in the lungs, enclosed in granulomatous tissues. Infiltrates of plasma cells including IgM and IgG, and deposits of IgM, IgG, and C3 were detected around the eggs and in the granulomatous tissues. A marked increase in serum antibody was observed. A. cantonensis larvae induce local antibody (IgM and IgG) production in the central nervous system prior to an increase of serum antibody titer. Measurement of cerebrospinal fluid antibody titer at an early stage of infection may confirm infection. The larvae showed no evidence of damage in spite of marked local antibody production in the central nervous system. The eggs in the lungs stimulated both local and systemic antibody production, and immune complexes were formed in the lung and the circulatory system.

An increased incidence of gout in patients receiving both diuretics and cyclosporine has been reported, but the effect of hyperuricemia on renal allograft function has not been studied. In a prospective, randomized trial of cyclosporine and prednisone versus azathioprine, prednisone, and antilymphocyte globulin for immunosuppression in renal allograft recipients, 105 of 131 cyclosporine and prednisone-treated patients (80 percent) experienced hyperuricemia (serum uric acid level above 8 mg/dl) and 13 of 131 (10 percent) were severely hyperuricemic (serum uric acid level above 14 mg/dl). In contrast, hyperuricemia developed in 63 of 115 patients (55 percent) treated with azathioprine, prednisone, and antilymphocyte globulin (p less than 0.002). Despite the frequent occurrence of hyperuricemia, gout was rare. Clinical gout developed in six patients in the cyclosporine and prednisone group and in 0 patients in the azathioprine, prednisone, and antilymphocyte globulin group between 1 and 43 months (median 22.5 months) after transplantation. Neither severe hyperuricemia nor diuretic therapy were associated with a significantly increased incidence of gout. The mean serum creatinine concentration of severely hyperuricemic patients (all on cyclosporine and prednisone) was similar to that of normouricemic cyclosporine and prednisone patients (1.8 mg/dl versus 1.6 mg/dl, p greater than 0.2), and the severely hyperuricemic patients had a 4-year graft survival rate of 90 percent. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia after renal transplantation does not adversely affect allograft function, requires no specific therapy, and is not a contraindication to use of diuretics.\r"

  ".W": "This is a study of the familial transmission of alcoholism in the families of 60 female and 240 male alcoholics ascertained in four psychiatric hospital units and in a local parole office. Eight hundred and thirty-one interviewed first-degree relatives and 125 spouses are included. The lifetime population prevalences of alcoholism in white males and females based on the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study in St. Louis were compared with the family rates. A semistructured comprehensive interview schedule (Home Environment and Lifetime Psychiatric Evaluation Record) was used and diagnoses made according to Feighner criteria for alcoholism. The methods of Survival Analysis established the presence of strong secular trends in the age-of-onset and lifetime prevalence of alcoholism in these families and in the general population. Accordingly, new methods for the analysis of family data that incorporate secular variation were developed. The Multifactorial Model of Disease Transmission was used to estimate familial correlations and these were parameterized by the \"Tau\" model of Familial Transmission. The model does not assume that all familial resemblance is due to genetic factors, but also includes the possibility of nongenetic transmission. Our analyses confirmed that more recently born cohorts of individuals had increased expected lifetime prevalences of alcoholism and decreased ages of onset, when compared with older cohorts. Separate age-of-onset distributions were required for males and females and the secular trends in age-of-onset were greatest in females. The differences between males and females were least in more recently born cohorts suggesting that sex-specific differences in the family and population distribution of alcoholism are decreasing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The data focuses on our search for mechanisms that might contribute to the elevated risk for alcoholism in sons of alcoholic fathers. Consistent results corroborated by several additional groups indicate that the higher risk sons of alcoholics demonstrate less intense reactions to ethanol as measured by their subjective self-reports, measures of body sway, changes in several hormones after drinking, and the intensity or persistence of ethanol-related changes on two electrophysiological measures. The potential implications of these results as they might relate to an enhanced vulnerability to alcoholism, and some possible future research directions, are discussed.\r"

Specific predictions from a neurobiological learning theory about the role of heritable personality traits in susceptibility to alcohol abuse were tested in this prospective longitudinal study. Three dimensions of childhood personality variation were identified and rated without knowledge of adult outcome. These three dimensions (novelty-seeking, harm avoidance, and reward dependence) were largely uncorrelated with one another, and each was predictive of later alcohol abuse. Absolute deviations from the mean of each of the three personality dimensions were associated with an exponential increase in the risk of later alcohol abuse. High novelty-seeking and low harm avoidance were most strongly predictive of early-onset alcohol abuse. These two childhood variables alone distinguished boys who had nearly 20-fold differences in their risk of alcohol abuse: the risk of alcohol abuse varied from 4 to 75% depending on childhood personality.\r"

The accuracy of self-reports, and thus of related risk levels, is of concern to investigators, to public health professionals, and to persons advising pregnant women. We contrasted quantitative reports of drinking in pregnancy by 238 women with retrospective reports obtained 5 years later. Although correlated (r = 0.67, p less than 0.0001), marked discrepancies suggested underreporting during pregnancy by a significant proportion of the women. The validity of the retrospective index was indicated in that it was somewhat more highly related to scores on the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) and to a tally of alcohol-related craniofacial anomalies in the neonate than was the in-pregnancy index. Furthermore, the retrospective index and the MAST score were significant predictors of other neonatal anomalies; the in-pregnancy index was not. The only variable related to underreporting was MAST score, i.e., the higher the MAST score the greater the underreporting. The results suggest that previously reported thresholds of effect based on self-report data may be underestimates. The results also suggest that questions regarding alcohol-related problems may be more effective than direct consumption questions in the identification of women who drink heavily in pregnancy.\r"

The ethanol-fed rats showed a significantly higher average level of adenosine compared to the pair-fed controls. When investigated monthly, however, adenosine in ethanol-fed rats increased only after the decrease in ATP had stabilized and AMP remained unchanged, indicating that these changes were not temporarily related. The average percentage of change in adenosine after acute hyperoxia or hypoxia were variable both in ethanol-fed and pair-fed rats. There was a tendency for a positive correlation between the percentage of change of adenosine and AMP after hyperoxia regardless of ethanol feeding. A negative correlation between the percentage of change of adenosine and energy charge, and a positive correlation between the percentage of change of adenosine and AMP were seen after hypoxia regardless of ethanol feeding. Adenosine levels changed rapidly in response to changes in systemic of pO2 in both the ethanol-fed and control rats, indicating that the liver maintained its normal response to the changes in energy state. The results indicate that chronic ethanol feeding does increase the level of adenosine in the liver and that this level remains responsive to acute changes in pO2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore a placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose, randomized, sequential, ascending-dose \"Phase I study\" was performed in healthy volunteers in order to determine the tolerance of 4-MP at dose levels of 10 (n = 4), 20 (n = 4), 50 (n = 4), and 100 mg/kg (n = 3). Along with each dose group, there were two placebos except with the 100 mg/kg group where there was only one placebo. In the 10 and 20 mg/kg group there were no side-effects in any subject. At the 50 mg/kg level, three out of four subjects experienced slight to moderate nausea and dizziness from 0 to 2.5 h after dosing. In the 100 mg/kg group all three subjects reported side-effects like nausea, dizziness, and vertigo, that were short-lived in two subjects, but lasted up to 30 h in one subject. The study was stopped after evaluation of the latter subject, so fewer subjects were completed in this last group. Despite these subjective side-effects, there were no significant changes in objective clinical parameters like pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, or blood and urine chemistries. We conclude that at a single dose of 4-MP (10-20 mg/kg) producing plasma levels within a probable therapeutic range, no side-effects were attributed to 4-MP.\r"

Left ventricular systolic pressure, peak relaxation rate, isovolumic pressure indexes, peak aortic flow rate, cardiac output, and stroke work of the control hearts were depressed to a greater extent than were those indexes of the alcoholic rat hearts during exposure to ethanol in vitro. Differences in the functional responses of controls and alcoholics were not the result of differences in energetics; myocardial O2 consumption, O2 supply-to-utilization ratio, and external work efficiency changed similarly in both groups of hearts during perfusion with ethanol. Cross-tolerance of the alcoholic rat hearts to the in vitro cardiodepressive effects of pentobarbital was also apparent. Peak rate of left ventricular pressure development, peak aortic flow rate, isovolumic pressure indexes, and cardiac output of the control rat hearts were significantly lower than those indexes of the alcoholic rat hearts during perfusion with 0.5 mM pentobarbital. In addition, four of the seven control hearts could not be paced during pentobarbital perfusion using 3V electrical pulses; the pacing voltage had to be raised and right ventricular pacing used to maintain stable function of those hearts at a 321 beats/min pacing rate. Myocardial O2 consumption and O2 supply-to-utilization ratios of control and alcoholic rat hearts were similar, but external work efficiency was slightly higher in the alcoholics than in controls during pentobarbital perfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ethanol concentrations higher than 32 mM were required in order to significantly modify erythrocyte Na+ transport function. The observed changes can be summarized as follows: (a) stimulation of Na+ efflux through the Na+, K+ pump (by 21-32% at 160-400 mM) and Na+:Li+ countertransport (by 34-59% at 160-400 mM); (b) inhibition of outward Na+, K+ cotransport (by 23-34% at 160-400 mM) and LiCO3- influx through the anion carrier (by 17-21% at 64-400 mM); and (c) increase in Na+ and K+ leaks (by 13-16% at 64-400 mM). The effects of ethanol on the Na+,K+ pump and Na+,K+ cotransport system resulted from changes in maximal rates of Na+ efflux (increased and decreased, respectively) without any significant effect on the apparent affinities for internal Na+. Erythrocytes preincubated for 1 hr with 160 mM ethanol, washed and further incubated in flux media, recovered a normal Na+ transport function. In conclusion, high concentrations of ethanol induced reversible perturbations of fluxes catalyzed by erythrocyte Na+ transport systems. The observed effects may reflect disturbances in Na+ transport function associated with severe intoxication.\r"

Before treatment, 57 patients (79%) had increased CDT values (Group A), whereas in 15 individuals (21%) (Group B), CDT levels were within the normal range. In 51 Group A patients, CDT decreased progressively after cessation of alcohol intake (half-life, 16 +/- 5 days), but fluctuated and remained abnormal in the remaining six. Nine Group B patients maintained normal CDT values throughout the follow-up period, but slightly or moderately increased levels were recorded on one occasion in the other six Group B subjects. Patients whose CDT levels had reached normal values after treatment, showed a recurrent increase in CDT after a relapse. gamma-Glutamyl transferase activities, which were elevated in 56% of Group A and in 80% of Group B alcoholics, showed a decrease after cessation of alcohol consumption in most patients with initially elevated values (Group A, 30 of 32; Group B, 10 of 12). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities, as well as mean corpuscular volumes (MCV) were normal in the majority of patients. CDT/total transferrin ratios correlated positively with CDT levels. CDT proved to be the most sensitive marker for chronic alcoholism (79%), whereas GGT activity levels were more useful only in patients with normal CDT levels before alcohol withdrawal. In the assessment of treatment outcome, the combination of CDT and GGT as markers yielded a sensitivity of 95%.\r"

Studies were also performed with respect to total RNA and protein synthesis as well as albumin secretion measured by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. We found that ethanol, when added to cultured hepatocytes, resulted in a substantial reduction in hormone-stimulated hepatocyte DNA synthesis and this effect was concentration dependent and occurred in serum-free medium. Ethanol also had an inhibitory effect on total RNA synthesis but protein synthesis and albumin secretion remained essentially unchanged. We determined that hepatocytes exposed to ethanol during the first 24 hr of culture were the most susceptible to inhibition of DNA synthesis. During the first 24 hr, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity was present in the cells at higher levels than at 48 and 72 hr. In human hepatoma cell lines and differentiated primary and secondary chick fibroblasts, no ADH activity was demonstrable; such cells were not inhibited by 100 mM ethanol additions and DNA synthesis rates were similar to untreated cultures. Other alcohols found to be metabolized by hepatocyte ADH were inhibitory towards hormone-stimulated DNA synthesis whereas those with less metabolism had little effect. Hepatocytes treated with 4-methylpyrazole, an inhibitor of ADH, were partially protected from ethanol effects. Taken together our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a major physiological effect of ethanol on the hepatocyte is a direct impairment of DNA synthesis and that alcohol metabolism is required.\r"

  ".W": "Chlorpropamide (CP), a sulfonylurea-type oral hypoglycemic agent, is known to provoke a flushing reaction reminiscent of the disulfiram-ethanol reaction in certain individuals. This is manifested in rodents by an increase in blood acetaldehyde levels after ethanol administration. When the sulfonamide N1-nitrogen of CP was substituted with an ethyl group, the product, N1-ethylchlorpropamide, was found to be three times as active as CP in raising ethanol-derived blood acetaldehyde. However, whereas CP lowered fasting blood glucose in rats measured over 6 h, N1-ethylchlorpropamide was devoid of hypoglycemic activity, suggesting that the latter might be potentially useful as an alcohol deterrent agent.\r"

Doses of each drug were chosen on the basis of the known degree and time course of NMDA antagonism seen in vivo after their systemic administration. Ketamine, administered at a dose of 20 mg.kg-1 iv, either immediately before or shortly after the 10-min ischemic period, failed to lessen neuronal damage in the selectively vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region. Increasing doses of ketamine administered over an increasing length of time in the postischemic period, however, did provide significant protection. MK-801 0.25 or 0.5 mg.kg-1 iv administered before ischemia also resulted in significant protection. The results support the proposal that NMDA receptor-mediated events may contribute to neuronal damage in selectively vulnerable regions of the central nervous system after ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to assess whether blood flow velocity signals, obtained by esophageal continuous-wave Doppler, reflect changes in ventricular performance. Ventricular performance has previously been determined by analysis of blood flow velocity signals sampled in the ascending aorta. In this investigation velocity signals were acquired from the descending aorta, with the use of an esophageal Doppler transducer. Maximum blood flow velocity (Vm), maximum blood flow volume acceleration (Accv), and maximum linear blood flow acceleration (Acc) were the velocity signals used to evaluate left ventricular performance. Twenty-six patients scheduled for myocardial revascularization and anesthetized with fentanyl (50 micrograms/kg) and pancuronium (0.15 mg/kg) were studied. In seven patients (Group I) a good correlation (r = 0.91) was observed between Accv in the ascending and descending aorta. In 10 patients (Group 2), halothane (0.5 and 1.0 MAC end-tidal) was added to the anesthetic. At these halothane concentrations Vm, Accv, and Acc measured in the descending aorta remained unchanged. Decreases were noted in the product of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and Acc (P-Acc; decreased 20% at 0.5 MAC and 39% at 1 MAC) and the product of systemic vascular resistance and Acc (R-Acc; decreased 25% at 1 MAC). In nine patients (Group 3), phenylephrine was used to reverse the decrease in MAP induced by 1 MAC halothane. Under these conditions Vm, Accv, Acc, and P-Acc showed similar decreases (approximately 30% of baseline values), whereas R-Acc returned to baseline values. In summary, indices of blood flow in the descending aorta were easily determined with a commercial transesophageal continuous-wave Doppler device. Descending and ascending aortic blood flow Accv correlated well, and the changes in the product of MAP and Acc in the descending aorta reflected the anticipated, halothane-induced, changes in left ventricular performance. In conclusion, descending aortic blood flow acceleration contains information on left ventricular performance that can be derived by the minimally invasive transesophageal Doppler technique.\r"

Venous production of prostacyclin (PGI2), thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was assessed by bioassay and/or radioimmunologic assays as appropriate. Fragments of saphenous veins from varicosed patients produced significantly less PGI2 and more TXA2 and PGE2 than those from the control patients. Addition of arachidonic acid to incubation mixtures dose dependently increased release of these prostanoids, but the levels of PGI2 produced were consistently lower in veins from varicosed patients. No differences were found in varicosed patients between various segments of the same vein, no matter whether macroscopically affected or unaffected. These results demonstrate that the cyclooxygenase pathway in the venous wall of subjects with varicosis is shifted toward lesser formation of PGI2 and higher production of proaggregatory and proinflammatory prostanoids such as PGE2 and TXA2. These biochemical changes may be relevant to inflammation and thrombogenesis in varicosis.\r"

  ".W": "Cow's milk allergy in the first year of life is one of the most common problems faced by pediatricians. Both over and under diagnosis is seen. Cow's milk allergy, which is IgE-mediated should be differentiated from milk intolerance due to lactase deficiency or other causes. Cow's milk allergy may effect the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, skin or blood. Anaphylaxis may occur. Diagnosis is made primarily on clinical grounds but skin tests and/or RAST are of value. Elimination and subsequent challenge confirms the diagnosis but challenge is not always necessary. Challenge should not be performed if there is evidence of anaphylaxis. Avoidance is the mainstay of treatment and breastfeeding is the optimal choice. Since antigenically intact cow's milk protein can pass into the breast milk, the mother should avoid excessive intake of milk products herself while breast feeding. Alternatives to breast milk such as soy formulas or hydrolysed casein or whey formulas may be used. Twenty-five percent of milk-sensitive infants are also allergic to soy protein. Hydrolysed casein formulas are more hypoallergenic but are expensive and less palatable. Hydrolysed whey formula, which is comparable in expense to soy formulas but is less allergenic, may prove of value in the management of the milk-allergic infant as well as for prophylaxis in infants from susceptible parents. Parents of infants born to families with bilateral atopic histories may be able to prevent milk allergy by using dietary manipulations which include decreased prenatal maternal milk intake and while breast feeding as well as careful avoidance of milk products in the infant's diet during the first year of life.\r"

In conclusion, FAST seems to be a promising technique for in vitro measurement of specific IgE against most inhalant allergens but some improvement is still necessary in standardizing allergens for this assay.\r"

Antioxidant drugs, given at the end of ischemia or at the very onset of reperfusion, can improve the postischemic function of isolated organs and the survival of intact animals subject to a cycle of circulatory arrest and reperfusion, suggesting that reperfusion injury is both a real and a preventable pathophysiologic entity.\r"

If patency is achieved sufficiently early and is maintained, left ventricular function is preserved and mortality decreases. The recent experience with tissue plasminogen activator and streptokinase in the TIMI I trial is reviewed with specific attention to reperfusion, reocclusion, and bleeding. Other studies concerning left ventricular preservation and mortality are also discussed. Current guidelines for antithrombotic therapy and thrombolysis are discussed. It is extremely important to adequately select patients to avoid side effects. Thorough lysis of the thrombus must be achieved to reduce the risk of rethrombosis. Simultaneous heparin should be administered to treat ongoing thrombosis. Additional antithrombotic therapy with aspirin and acute vasodilation to reduce vasoconstriction probably also decrease the likelihood of reocclusion. Because this treatment predisposes to bleeding, extreme care should be taken to avoid vascular punctures and invasive procedures in these patients. The association of immediate percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty has not been beneficial in preventing further events; on the contrary, adverse effects have been associated with this acute intervention.\r"

Early fibrinolysis with a small decrease in fibrinogen was observed, and d-dimers were elevated at four hours, indicating early clot lysis. At three months, patients with moderate to severe strokes (less than 40 on the Scandinavian Stroke Scale) in the ancrod group showed average improvement by a factor of 3 over the placebo group. No bleeding, abnormal laboratory results, or deaths occurred, but ancrod was discontinued in one patient who had seizures.

The study involved 239 patients, 226 pulseless, nonbreathing patients (rhythms of asystole and electromechanical dissociation with heart rates less than 70) and 13 patients with hemodynamically significant bradycardia (heart rate less than 60; blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg; not responding to atropine). Patients were assigned to treatment or control groups on an every-other-day basis. One hundred three patients were treated with an external cardiac pacing device; 22 (21.4%) were resuscitated (arrival at admitting hospital with pulse and blood pressure) and seven (6.8%) were saved (survival to hospital discharge). One hundred thirty-six patients were not paced and served as controls; 28 (20.6%) were resuscitated (P = .90) and six (4.4%) were saved (P = .71). Analysis of pacing times showed increased resuscitation in patients paced early. All surviving paced patients were paced in 17 minutes or less. Analysis of rhythm subgroups showed no significant difference in the resuscitation or survival rates of paced and control groups for primary asystole, primary electromechanical dissociation, and secondary asystole and electromechanical dissociation occurring after countershock treatment of ventricular fibrillation when compared respectively. However, among patients with hypotensive bradycardia, six of six paced patients were resuscitated and five were saved, while only two of seven controls were resuscitated (P = .01) and one was saved (P = .01). Interpretation of the bradycardic patient data is limited by inequalities noted between control and treatment groups with regard to the administration of isoproterenol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

What appears to be the most extensive traumatic abdominal hernia so far described is presented. Traumatic abdominal herniae fall into three general categories: small lower quadrant abdominal defects and inguinal hernias, typically the result of blunt trauma with bicycle handlebars, are the most common; larger abdominal wall defects sustained in motor vehicle accidents are the next most common hernias; intra-abdominal herniations through rents in the retroperitoneum are rarely seen. The diagnosis may often be established with physical examination alone. Conventional radiology, computerized tomography, and ultrasound have also proven useful. Because of the high incidence of other associated intra-abdominal injuries, early exploration and repair through a midline incision is advocated. Adequate debridement and solid repair of fascial planes with non-absorbable sutures are required to prevent recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "Mucinous carcinomas accounted for 37 (6.4%) of 540 cases of colorectal carcinoma. The clinical and pathological features of these mucinous carcinomas were compared with those of the 510 well or moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas. Mucinous carcinoma was more common in the patients 39 years of age or under (P less than 0.05) and was more frequent in the female patients. A large number of mucinous carcinomas were located in the rectum, followed by the right colon. However, the right colon showed a higher relative incidence (40.5% vs 12.5%, P less than 0.005). Mucinous carcinoma was characterized by infiltration of the surrounding tissues (24.3% vs 7.8%, P less than 0.005), positive lymph node involvement (75.7% vs 48.6%, P less than 0.005), and peritoneal implant (21.6% vs 4.1%, P less than 0.005). The cumulative five and ten year survival rates after resection of mucinous carcinoma were 45.5 per cent and 39.8 per cent, respectively, and those after curative resection, 72.4 per cent and 63.5 per cent, respectively. These survival rates were lower, without significant differences, than those for the well or moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas. The results suggest the need for aggressive lymph node dissection and wide excision of the surrounding tissues for mucinous carcinoma, with special attention paid to local recurrence.\r"

DESIGN: Nonrandomized prospective trial of combined treatment with two drugs; findings in these patients were compared with those in control patients treated with either of the two drugs alone. SETTING: Medical, pediatric, and intensive care units of a tertiary-care cancer treatment center. PATIENTS: Consecutive cases of 10 patients in the study group and of 11 patients in a historical control group with evidence of cytomegalovirus pneumonia after bone marrow transplantation for treatment of leukemia or congenital immune deficiency. INTERVENTIONS: Study Group (10 patients): ganciclovir, 2.5 mg/kg body weight, three times daily for 20 days, plus intravenous immune globulin, 500 mg/kg every other day for ten doses. Patients were then given ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg.d three to five times a week for 20 more doses, and intravenous immune globulin, 500 mg/kg twice a week for 8 more doses. Control Group (11 patients): ganciclovir alone (2 patients), 5 mg/kg twice a day for 14 to 21 days; cytomegalovirus hyperimmune globulin (5 patients), 400 mg/kg.d for 10 days; and intravenous immune globulin (4 patients), 400 mg/kg.d for 10 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Responses were observed in all patients treated with combination therapy; 7 of 10 patients were alive and well, and had no recurrence of disease at a median of 10 months after therapy. No therapeutic benefit was observed, and none of the 11 patients treated with either ganciclovir or intravenous immune globulin alone survived (P = 0.001 by Fisher exact test). CONCLUSIONS: Ganciclovir, when combined with high-dose intravenous immune globulin, appears to have significantly altered the outcome of patients with cytomegalovirus pneumonia after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\r"

DESIGN: Consecutive entry trial with treatment for a minimum of 14 days. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 25 patients with bone marrow transplants and cytomegalovirus pneumonia after transplant proven by open lung biopsy or bronchoalveolar lavage. Patients with abnormal renal function or concomitant infectious causes of pneumonia, or who were respirator-dependent at diagnosis, were not eligible. INTERVENTIONS: Induction treatment consisted of ganciclovir, 2.5 mg/kg body weight every 8 hours for 14 days, and cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin, 400 mg/kg on days 1, 2, and 7 and 200 mg/kg on day 14. Ganciclovir dosage was adjusted for renal function. Patients who were improved but still symptomatic after 14 days were given maintenance treatment consisting of ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg once daily for an additional 14 days, and immunoglobulin, 200 mg/kg on day 21. Patients with clinical deterioration continued to receive induction doses. Ganciclovir therapy was discontinued if the neutrophil count fell below 500 X 10(6)/L for 2 consecutive days. MEASUREMENT and MAIN RESULTS: Serial tests of renal and liver function, blood counts, and viral cultures of blood, throat, and urine were obtained 3 times a week. Thirteen of twenty-five (52%) patients (95% CI, 31 to 72) survived the initial episode of pneumonia. Viral excretion ceased in 17 of 23 (74%) patients treated more than 96 hours. Proven recurrences of pneumonia occurred in 3 patients and possible recurrences in 2 after treatment was stopped. Three patients developed neutropenia during induction therapy and 6 patients during maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Survival of 13 (52%) of 25 patients from the initial episode of cytomegalovirus pneumonia with the regimen of ganciclovir and cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin is significantly better (P less than 0.001) than the survival of 13 of 89 (15%) patients using previous antiviral regimens.\r"

DESIGN: Open label, phase I/II study of G-CSF, given by daily subcutaneous injection for up to 7 weeks. SETTING: Outpatient oncology clinic of a university medical center. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of four patients with hairy cell leukemia complicated by severe neutropenia. Three patients completed the study; one patient was removed after 2 weeks of therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given by daily subcutaneous injection. Each patient began therapy with 1 microgram/kg body weight.d; after 1 week the dose was increased to 3 micrograms/kg.d, and 1 week later to 6 micrograms/kg.d. Therapy was continued for 5 to 6 weeks. Patients were taught self-injection, and administered treatment at home. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: In three patients, an increase in absolute neutrophil counts from less than 0.9 X 10(9)/L to greater than 4.0 X 10(9)/L was noted within 2 weeks of beginning G-CSF therapy. In two patients, infections resolved during therapy. One patient developed acute neutrophilic dermatosis (the Sweet syndrome) while receiving 3 micrograms/kg.d of G-CSF, and drug therapy was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may increase neutrophil counts within 2 weeks in patients with hairy cell leukemia and neutropenia. This therapy may be a useful adjunct to definitive treatment of hairy cell leukemia with interferon or pentostatin.\r"

Responsiveness to PTH can once again be tested with teriparatide acetate, the newly available, biologically active 1-34 fragment of human PTH. The PTH infusion test can be used to confirm a preliminary diagnosis based on serum immunoreactive PTH values, to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 pseudohypoparathyroidism, or to detect a subtle abnormality of calcium metabolism in normocalcemic patients with features suggesting pseudohypoparathyroidism. Of several variables used to express changes in renal metabolism of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) or phosphate, the 30-minute change in cAMP excretion per unit of glomerular filtration and the 60-minute percentage fall in the tubular maximum for phosphate reabsorption provide the best discrimination. Teriparatide has a low incidence of adverse reactions and provides an effective diagnostic tool.\r"

DESIGN: Formal decision analysis to determine the relative value of several diagnostic strategies and information synthesis of studies evaluating noninvasive diagnostic tests. SETTING: We did a secondary analysis of the literature, using available data to generate estimates for the probability of selected, clinically important events and the utilities of relevant outcomes observed in patients when carotid artery disease is present or absent, and we critically appraised studies reported since 1980 to estimate the sensitivity and specificity, safety, limitations, and costs of diagnostic tests. MAIN RESULTS: For patients with asymptomatic neck bruits who are and who are not being considered as candidates for other vascular surgery, no diagnostic testing is recommended. For symptomatic patients with anterior-circulation transient ischemic attacks or previous minor strokes, noninvasive diagnostic testing is recommended if surgical treatment is being considered. Patients who previously had minor strokes could be directly referred for selective carotid angiography because they have a higher likelihood of a surgically approachable carotid lesion. Patients with nonlateralizing signs and symptoms of ischemia do not need diagnostic evaluation of possible carotid artery disease unless their symptoms are related to ischemia in the carotid artery circulation. The preferred noninvasive diagnostic test is duplex ultrasound, which has a sensitivity of approximately 85% and a specificity of 90%. If duplex ultrasound is not available, an alternative noninvasive test is carotid Doppler ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend a conservative diagnostic approach in patients with suspected carotid artery disease. Noninvasive diagnostic testing is indicated only for symptomatic patients with transient ischemic attacks in the anterior circulation who are considered candidates for carotid endarterectomy, when knowledge of the vessel anatomy is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "The decision to use bedside pulmonary artery catheterization for managing patients must involve a careful assessment of the risks compared to the benefits. Complications can be minimized by following specific guidelines for catheter insertion and maintenance. Pulmonary artery catheterization has been shown to be more accurate than clinical assessment alone in critically ill patients for determining the cause of shock (hypovolemic, cardiogenic, or septic) or for assessing the cause of severe pulmonary edema (cardiogenic or noncardiogenic). The diagnosis of cardiac failure in medical or surgical patients with invasive hemodynamic monitoring provides physiologic data that guide pharmacologic treatment that may favorably influence preload and afterload in the failing or ischemic heart. Managing hemodynamics with the aid of pulmonary artery catheterization in patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome has received considerable attention, but a contribution to better patient outcome has not been established. Similarly, although clinical management of hemodynamic instability in septic shock is facilitated by pulmonary artery catheterization, the mortality remains very high because of the lack of specific therapy to reverse the sepsis syndrome. Adequate volume resuscitation and improved tissue oxygenation are universally accepted goals, but specific hemodynamic endpoints are controversial and direct measurements of tissue oxygenation are not possible. Prospective studies to define the clinical value of pulmonary artery catheterization are needed, but must be designed very carefully in order to identify unequivocally the effect of pulmonary artery catheterization on outcome in critically ill patients.\r"

PATIENTS: Fifty-eight patients with untreated syphilis who consented to lumbar puncture, representing approximately 10% of new cases of syphilis during the study period. INTERVENTIONS: Lumbar puncture was done on all patients. Rabbit inoculation was used to test cerebrospinal fluid for viable T. pallidum. Patients with normal fluid received recommended benzathine penicillin therapy according to the stage of syphilis; patients with CSF abnormalities were offered 10-day therapy for neurosyphilis. RESULTS: Treponema pallidum was isolated from the CSF of 12 (30%) of 40 patients (95% CI, 17 to 46) with untreated primary and secondary syphilis; isolation of T. pallidum was significantly associated (P = 0.008) with the presence of two or more abnormal laboratory variables (among leukocyte count, protein concentration, and CSF-Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] test). Two (67%) of 3 early latent (CI, 13 to 100) and 3 (20%) of 15 late latent syphilis patients (CI, 5 to 47) also had reactive CSF-VDRL tests and elevated cell and protein levels, although T. pallidum was not isolated. Concurrent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was not associated with isolation of T. pallidum, increased number of CSF abnormalities, or reactive CSF serologic tests for syphilis, although CSF pleocytosis was commoner in subjects infected with HIV. Treatment with conventional benzathine penicillin G (2.4 mIU) failed to cure 3 of 4 patients with secondary syphilis from whom T. pallidum was isolated before therapy; all 3 patients in whom treatment failed were HIV seropositive when treated or seroconverted during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Central nervous system invasion by T. pallidum is common in early syphilis, and is apparently independent of HIV infection. Examination of the CSF may be beneficial in patients with early syphilis, and therapy should be guided by knowledge of central nervous system involvement. Conventional benzathine penicillin G therapy may have reduced efficacy in patients with early syphilis who are also infected with HIV.\r"

Alterations in the macronutrient and micronutrient constituent of the diet can modulate gene expression. Anorexia is common in elderly persons. The results of studies in animals suggest that aging is associated with a decrease in the opioid feeding drive and an increase in the satiating effect of cholecystokinin. Unrecognized depression is a common, treatable cause of anorexia and weight loss in elderly persons. Protein synthesis decreases in elderly persons; nevertheless, nitrogen balance can be maintained in patients with fairly low intakes of protein. Carbohydrate intolerance is common and may be modulated by nutritional intervention and physical activity. The role of cholesterol in the development of heart disease in very old persons is controversial. Homebound and institutionalized elderly persons often do not expose their skin to sunlight; because the skin of older persons has a decreased ability to form vitamin D, the vitamin D status in these persons is precarious and they are at risk for osteopenia. Vitamins are often abused by elderly persons. Drug administration alters the vitamin requirements of persons. Borderline zinc state has been associated with deteriorating immune function, especially in persons who have diabetes mellitus or who abuse alcohol. Zinc administration appears to protect against the deteriorating vision associated with age-related macular degeneration. Selenium deficiency seems to be associated with an increased prevalence of cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The management of asymptomatic cholelithiasis in patients with diabetes is controversial. We used decision analysis to compare expectant management to prophylactic cholecystectomy in asymptomatic diabetic patients. Relevant probabilities were derived from the literature or expert opinion. Hypothetical cohorts of patients were followed for their lifetimes under each strategy. Expectant management was almost always the superior course. For example, a 30-year-old diabetic man gains an average of 6.1 months of life by choosing expectant management over prophylactic surgery. The superiority of expectant management was invariant to changes in age, sex, and the extent to which major surgical complications affect the future quality of life. Prophylactic cholecystectomy was superior only with extremely high estimates of the likelihood of developing symptomatic disease, the probability of requiring emergency surgery after symptoms develop, and emergency surgical mortality rates. However, no single factor had sufficient impact to alter the optimal decision by itself; the probabilities of several untoward events had to be increased simultaneously to favor prophylactic cholecystectomy. Prophylactic surgery for silent gallstones in diabetic patients does not increase life expectancy or quality of life and may in fact reduce it. This result holds over a wide range of basic assumptions.\r"

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Epstein-Barr virus DNA and protein were detected in the bone marrow of 5 patients studied prospectively and in 1 of 40 patients studied retrospectively. As estimated by in-situ hybridization, about 3% to 5% of marrow cells were infected with virus in those patients who had not received acyclovir. In contrast, Epstein-Barr virus DNA was not detected in peripheral blood DNA of these patients, nor were Epstein-Barr virus proteins or DNA found in the bone marrow of normal donors, patients with other hematologic diseases, or in 1 patient with acute infectious mononucleosis. Analysis of DNA fragments by hybridization with Epstein-Barr virus probes showed a pattern dissimilar to the type of Epstein-Barr virus usually associated with infectious mononucleosis. CONCLUSIONS: Aplastic anemia may be associated with Epstein-Barr virus more commonly than suspected by history. Localization of the virus in the bone marrow supports a causative role for Epstein-Barr virus in bone marrow failure.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe the spectrum of illnesses associated with Escherichia coli 0157:H7 infections. DESIGN: Described an outbreak that showed the broad spectrum of these infections. Reviewed the clinical findings in the other eight major outbreaks reported between 1982 and 1986. Also reviewed reports of sporadic cases. SETTING: Outbreaks in communities, nursing homes, a day care center, and a kindergarten. CASES: Persons identified in outbreaks of E. coli 0157:H7 infections. RESULTS: Escherichia coli 0157:H7 infection causes bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic colitis), nonbloody diarrhea, the hemolytic uremic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Infection can be asymptomatic, can involve extraintestinal sites, and can be fatal. Bloody diarrhea is the commonest symptom. Most patients have severe abdominal cramps; fever is documented in less than half. Findings from fecal leukocyte examinations often suggest a noninfectious cause. Results of radiologic and colonoscopic examinations can be consistent with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease or ischemic colitis. Patients at the extremes of age are at increased risk for E. coli 0157:H7-associated diarrhea, the hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and death. Antimicrobial agents have not been shown to modify the illness, but there are few data on individual agents. CONCLUSION: Infection with E. coli 0157:H7 should be considered in all patients with bloody diarrhea, the hemolytic uremic syndrome, or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura because the infection can masquerade as gastrointestinal bleeding of noninfectious cause, the antecedent diarrhea may be resolved and forgotten by the time the hemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is diagnosed, and the detection of E. coli 0157:H7 requires specific stool culture techniques.\r"

Real-time ultrasonography and cholescintigraphy, both highly sensitive and specific tests, are the two major methods for assessing gallbladder pathology. Oral cholecystography, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, and percutaneous gallbladder puncture serve as supplementary tests. Decisions about which test to use depend on the kind of gallbladder disease that is suspected as well as the estimated likelihood of the disease before the information is obtained from the procedure. Thus, ultrasonography is the test of choice for chronic cholecystitis, with oral cholecystography reserved for situations in which the diagnosis is uncertain after ultrasonography. When acute cholecystitis is suspected, ultrasonography is also the test of choice in most patients, and cholescintigraphy is used to resolve uncertainty.\r"

To help understand the significance of these data, we evaluated the HSV type 1 vitreous and serum antibodies in eight patients undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for diabetic vitreous hemorrhage, diabetic traction detachment, or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Undiluted vitreous and diluted serum specimens were tested for HSV IgG antibodies using the fluorescence immunoassay (FIAX) technique. Two patients had undetectable vitreous and serum titers. In the other six patients, the serum (diluted) results ranged from 59 to 191 FIAX units (1:40-1:160 titer), and the vitreous (undiluted) levels ranged from 15 to 56 FIAX units (1:20-1:80 titer). The serum: vitreous ratio corrected for dilution ranged from 220 to 1120. We have shown that an isolated, undiluted vitreous HSV type 1 titer as high as 1:80 occurs without evidence of intraocular herpetic infection. When detectable, the serum titer is, on average, 400 times greater than the vitreous. Further investigation is needed to determine if intraocular HSV antibody production occurs in retinitis and results in a lower serum: vitreous ratio.\r"

In vitro potency, pharmacokinetic disposition, and other factors determine the usual dosing regimen. Knowledge of the serum bactericidal activity over time may assist in defining the potency of comparative antimicrobial agents. Cefoxitin and ceftizoxime, cephalosporins with gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic activity, have been promoted as monotherapy in the treatment of intra-abdominal infection. In a randomized, crossover study, six healthy volunteers received single 30-mg/kg doses of cefoxitin and ceftizoxime. Greater serum activity against Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis was observed with ceftizoxime than with cefoxitin. The results suggest that ceftizoxime can be administered in a lower daily dosage than cefoxitin. We propose that the present study may serve as a prototype for future studies attempting to assess equivalent dosing regimens for antibiotics with similar spectra of activity.\r"

Recognition that relatively specific microfloras are associated with distinct clinical forms of periodontal disease has prompted the use of antimicrobial agents as adjuncts in periodontal therapy. Clindamycin is one of several antibiotics known to concentrate in bioactive form in neutrophils and to potentiate phagocyte bactericidal activity against certain bacteria. Neutrophils appear to play a key role in host defense against periodontopathic gram-negative bacteria. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of preincubation of neutrophils with therapeutically achievable concentrations of clindamycin upon subsequent in vitro bactericidal activity against three species of gram-negative periodontal bacteria, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga ochracea. In each instance, clindamycin neither enhanced nor inhibited the kinetics of bactericidal activity at low bacterium-neutrophil multiplicities. Further, this antibiotic had no demonstrable effect upon neutrophil bactericidal capacity, as assessed at bacterium-neutrophil ratios as high as 50:1. Our results indicate that clindamycin does not potentiate neutrophil bactericidal activity against the species of gram-negative periodontal organisms tested.\r"

This reaction results in opening of the epoxide ring of the antibiotic to form an inactive adduct, the structure of which was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance. Dialyzed extracts prepared from resistant Escherichia coli strains were unable to modify fosfomycin unless exogenous glutathione was added to the reaction mixtures. Similarly, mutants defective in glutathione biosynthesis were susceptible to fosfomycin, despite harboring a resistance plasmid. Extracts of resistant but not susceptible strains could join glutathione to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, confirming the nature of the enzymatic activity. Adduct formation appeared to be specific for glutathione: none of the other thiols tested (cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, and dithiothreitol) could modify fosfomycin.\r"

The effects of imipenem, a round form inducer in gram-negative rods, and piperacillin, a filamentous form inducer, were compared. Bacteria grown in the presence of sub-MICs of imipenem or piperacillin were incubated for 30 min with macrophage monolayers in the absence of antibiotic. Phagocytosis, killing, and survival within macrophages were evaluated by microbiological and fluorescence microscope assays. Bacteria grown in the presence of a sub-MIC of imipenem were phagocytized and killed in numbers significantly higher than untreated or piperacillin-treated bacteria were. Intracellular bacteria pretreated with a sub-MIC of imipenem were also readily killed by lymphokine-activated macrophages. Prior treatment with a sub-MIC of imipenem resulted in an increased susceptibility of E. coli but not S. aureus to the bactericidal activity of immune serum. Imipenem treatment and immune serum acted synergistically to enhance phagocytosis and killing. The data indicate that exposure of E. coli and S. aureus to a sub-MIC of imipenem enhances the susceptibility of these potential pathogens to cellular and humoral host defense mechanisms.\r"

Of 42 patients who could be evaluated, 82% of the carumonam-treated patients and 80% of the ceftazidime-treated patients were cured clinically. At 5 to 9 days posttherapy, microbiologic criteria indicated that 13 carumonam-treated patients (48%) and 8 ceftazidime-treated patients (53%) were cured. Patients with indwelling bladder catheters at the end of therapy had a markedly worse microbiologic outcome than those without catheters. Enterococcus sp. reinfection was common in both groups. Possible adverse clinical and laboratory reactions occurred in six carumonam-treated patients (21%) and four ceftazidime-treated patients (27%). Most reactions occurred at the end of therapy and resolved with discontinuation of the study drug.

One of these groups, which included cefmenoxime, ceftriaxone, cefuzonam, and cefotaxime, showed a clear paradoxical antibacterial activity against P. vulgaris. This group showed growth-inhibitory activity at relatively low concentrations, up to certain limits. These cephalosporins have, as a common moiety, an aminothiazolyl-oxyimino group in the 7-acyl side chain and have high beta-lactamase-inducing activities and low stabilities against the beta-lactamase. In a mutant strain incapable of inducing beta-lactamase, however, the paradoxical antibacterial activity was not observed. These findings suggest that beta-lactamase plays an essential role in the paradoxical antibacterial effect in P. vulgaris. We conclude that the induction of a large amount of beta-lactamase and the low stability against beta-lactamase may account for the paradoxical antibacterial activity in P. vulgaris.\r"

Herpes simplex virus type 1 infection increased the dTTP pool and thymidylate synthetase activity but reduced thymidine excretion. Addition of acyclovir to infected cells increased thymidine excretion, the dTTP pool, and thymidylate synthetase activity. Addition of a virus-specific ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor (A723U) decreased all three. The synergy between the two compounds is discussed.\r"

Fluorescence microscopy of cells treated with the dansylated SA/PC-liposomes suggested that the liposomes bound to and accumulated on the cell surface, eventually damaging the plasma membrane. SA/PC-liposomes showed no significant hemolysis when incubated with human and mouse erythrocytes under conditions that killed greater than 99.9% of the T. b. gambiense trypomastigotes. Human leukocytes were also shown to be less susceptible to SA/PC-liposomes than T. b. gambiense. These results may point to a new direction in strategy for therapy of African trypanosomiasis.\r"

In order to determine whether there is a correlation between quinolone-induced inhibition of early (i.e., 10 to 15 min) DNA synthesis and potency (MICs and MBCs), we measured the rate of DNA synthesis in log-phase Escherichia coli K-12 by using [3H]thymidine incorporation. Three quinolones (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and difloxacin) were selected based on their decreasing activity against reference strain KL16. All three quinolones caused an early 50% inhibition of DNA synthesis which was proportional to MICs and MBCs (r greater than 0.99). Furthermore, 50% inhibition of DNA synthesis and MICs were nearly identical for mutant strains with an altered quinolone target (gyrA) or with decreased [nfxB(ompF)] or increased (acrA) permeability. There were significant differences (P less than 0.001) between individual quinolones in the degree of DNA synthesis inhibition in nalidixic acid-resistant gyrA and nfxB(ompF) mutant strains. The comparison of the three mutants with the wild-type strain permitted an in vivo examination of the effects of alterations of the drug target or entry on the activity determined by DNA synthesis inhibition and MICs.\r"

Furthermore, 3-chloro-DAP inhibited growth of two E. coli mutants. In one of the mutants known for supersusceptibility to beta-lactams, inhibition was not seen until the mid-log phase of growth, while in the other mutant, a DAP auxotroph, inhibition occurred much earlier. Growth inhibition was reversed by DAP in both strains. In the auxotroph, the reversal was specific for meso-DAP, indicating that DAP epimerase was the target for 3-chloro-DAP. Thus we suggest a novel mechanism of bacterial growth inhibition which depends on DAP epimerase inhibition by a DAP analog.\r"

  ".U": "89049062\r", 
  ".W": "The fluoroquinolone antibiotics are structurally related to nalidixic acid. Their primary antibacterial action appears to be mainly due to inhibition of DNA gyrase (DNA topoisomerase II). We determined the activity of several fluoroquinolones in vitro against two strains of Plasmodium falciparum, FCC1 (chloroquine susceptible) and VNS (chloroquine resistant). [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation by malarial parasites was determined at 48 and 96 h. The molarity at which each agent caused a 50% decrease in the incorporation of [3H]hypoxanthine compared with that of drug-free controls was defined as the 50% inhibitory concentration. The fluoroquinolones evaluated were amifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and pefloxacin. Other DNA gyrase inhibitors tested were nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid, novobiocin, and coumermycin A1. Among the fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin had the lowest 50% inhibitory concentrations at 48 h against both chloroquine-susceptible and -resistant strains of P. falciparum, (0.26 +/- 0.08) x 10(-4) and (0.38 +/- 0.15) x 10(-4) M, respectively (mean +/- standard deviation). Enoxacin had the lowest 50% inhibitory concentrations against FCC1 and VNS at 96 h, 0.23 x 10(-5) and (0.06 +/- 0.04) x 10(-5) M, respectively. With the VNS strain, fractional inhibitory concentration indexes for the combination of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were calculated at 48 and 96 h to be 0.93 and 0.79, respectively, indicating modest additive effects. The combination of novobiocin with ciprofloxacin showed indifference in the same system. The antimalarial effects of some fluoroquinolones occur at achievable serum concentrations. Whether inhibition of DNA gyrase contributes to the antimalarial activity of the fluoroquinolones is unknown at present.\r"

Studies of everted inner membrane vesicles suggested that this reduced accumulation involved a carrier-mediated norfloxacin active efflux generated by proton motive force with an apparent Km of 0.2 mM and a Vmax of 3 nmol min-1 mg of protein-1. Other hydrophilic, but not hydrophobic, quinolones competed with norfloxacin for transport. Porin (OmpF)-deficient E. coli cells were twofold less susceptible to norfloxacin and showed twice as much energy-dependent reduction in drug uptake. However, active efflux assayed in everted vesicles from the OmpF strain was unchanged compared with that in the parental strain. These findings suggest that in the OmpF mutant decreased outer membrane permeability, combined with active efflux across the inner membrane, in some manner results in decreased steady-state uptake of norfloxacin and lowered drug susceptibility.\r"

Time-elapsed spectral analysis of the reaction of the labeled cephalothin with the TEM-2 beta-lactamase purified from Escherichia coli revealed the progressive loss of the cephalothin acetyl resonance at 176.8 ppm and accumulation of an acetate signal at 184.3 ppm. Spectral results identical to those observed in the in vitro experiment were obtained when compound 1 was incubated with cell suspensions of E. coli JSR-O (pBR322), which contains the plasmid-encoded TEM-2 beta-lactamase, and Enterobacter cloacae strains that contain a class I chromosomal beta-lactamase. Pseudo-first-order rate constants for the lactamase-catalyzed formation of acetate from cephalothin in vivo were obtained by integration of the 13C-acetyl resonances of compound 1 during timed incubations with cell preparations. These results constitute the first demonstration of the ability to monitor beta-lactamase activity in viable cells by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.\r"

At the end of treatment, 35 of 36 (97%) patients given cefoperazone and 23 of 28 (82%) given ampicillin-tobramycin were cured of their infection (P = 0.07). Pathogens were recovered from the bile in 32 patients; microbiological cures were observed in 18 of 19 (94%) patients receiving cefoperazone and 8 of 13 (62%) receiving ampicillin-tobramycin (P = 0.03). Thirteen patients had septicemia. None (0%) of the eight septicemic patients from the cefoperazone group, but two of five (40%) from the ampicillin-tobramycin group, were clinical failures. Of the isolated pathogens, 51% were resistant to ampicillin, while the resistance rate was 4% for tobramycin and 1% for cefoperazone (P less than 0.001). Biliary concentrations of cefoperazone were maintained at high levels--236 +/- 87 micrograms/ml up to 12 h after administration. Even in the presence of severe obstruction, cefoperazone levels in the bile and gallbladder wall were above MICs for most pathogens. Cefoperazone may be considered as an excellent alternative in the therapy of severe biliary tract infections.\r"

Proliferation of epimastigotes in liver infusion-tryptose medium at 28 degrees C was immediately arrested by any of these drugs at greater than or equal to 3 x 10(-5) M; cell lysis occurred 24 h later. Below that concentration, SF 86-327 at concentrations down to 1 x 10(-6) M stopped growth after 48 h. In contrast, ketoconazole slowed cell growth only moderately, but proliferation finally stopped and cell lysis occurred after 120 h at 3 x 10(-6) M. Synergistic effects could be observed when the two drugs were used in combination: the concentration of SF 86-327 required to reduce the cell growth to 25% of controls in 144 h was reduced 33-fold in the presence of 1 x 10(-6) M ketoconazole, which by itself reduced growth only by 30%. Amastigotes, proliferating in Vero cells at 37 degrees C, were much more susceptible to both drugs, but ketoconazole was definitely a more potent antiparasitic agent than the allylamine in this system: whereas the concentration of SF 86-327 required to reduce the number of infected cells to 50% of controls was 1 x 10(-7) M and that required to completely eradicate the parasite was 3 x 10(-6) M, for ketoconazole these concentrations were 1 x 10(-10) M and 1 x 10(-8) M, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

FEC-1 differed notably from chromosomal E. coli cephalosporinase, especially in its broad-spectrum substrate profile and its high inhibition by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and imipenem. A conjugation study revealed that FEC-1 was encoded by a 74-megadalton plasmid, pFCX1. This may be the first instance of a plasmid-mediated oxyimino-cephalosporinase from E. coli.\r"

The other stringent control antagonists tested (gentamicin, tobramycin, and, to a lesser extent, amikacin) unexpectedly failed to relax the control of LPS synthesis, and this was subsequently shown to be due to their inhibitory action on LPS synthesis. The release of LPS by nongrowing (amino acid-deprived and antibiotic-treated) bacteria was stimulated only under conditions in which the control of LPS synthesis was relaxed.\r"

The decreased adhesion was accompanied by a reduction in the synthesis of fimbrial subunits and in the expression of assembled fimbriae. These results suggest that the anti-infectious activity of berberine sulfate in E. coli-induced urinary tract infections may be mediated by the selective suppression of the synthesis and assembly of fimbriae by uropathogenic organisms.\r"

Lesional skin from patients with early mild GVHD and drug reactions showed a CD4/CD8 ratio of 5.0 or more, but later biopsy specimens from patients with acute GVHD and the majority of sections from those with chronic GVHD showed a CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.8 to 3.0 due to increased numbers of presumably cytotoxic cells. Significant numbers of suppressor (CD11 +/- CD16b-) cells were found in only one patient with severe chronic GVHD. Natural killer cells were not found. Preliminary examination of lesional skin from seven autologous BMT patients showed a similar trend of decreased CD4/CD8 ratios in the three patients with a syndrome that resembled GVHD. Analysis of CD4/CD8 ratios in serial biopsy specimens from patients with GVHD may allow more accurate monitoring of the progression of cutaneous GVHD and may help to elucidate the mechanism of development of the GVHD-like reaction in autologous BMT patients.\r"

  ".W": "Experience in the management of mass casualties following a disaster is relatively sparse. The terrorist bombing serves as a timely and effective model for the analysis of patterns of injury and mortality and the determination of the factors influencing casualty survival in the wake of certain forms of disaster. For this purpose, a review of the published experience with terrorist bombings was carried out, providing a study population of 3357 casualties from 220 incidents worldwide. There were 2934 immediate survivors of these incidents (87%), of whom 881 (30%) were hospitalized. Forty deaths ultimately occurred among these survivors (1.4%), 39 of whom were among those hospitalized (4.4%). Injury severity was determined from available data for 1339 surviving casualties, 251 of whom were critically injured (18.7%). Of this population evaluable for injury severity, there were 31 late deaths, all of which occurred among those critically injured, accounting for an overall \"critical mortality\" rate of 12.4%. Overall triage efficiency was characterized by a mean overtriage rate (noncritically injured among those hospitalized or evacuated) of 59%, and a mean undertriage rate (critically injured among those not hospitalized or evacuated) of .05%. Multiple linear regression analysis of all major bombing incidents demonstrated a direct linear relationship between overtriage and critical mortality (r2 = .845), and an inversely proportional relationship between triage discrimination and critical mortality (r2 = 0.855). Although head injuries predominated in both immediate (71%) and late (52%) fatalities, injury to the abdomen carried the highest specific mortality rate (19%) of any single body system injury among immediate survivors. These data clearly document the importance of accurate triage as a survival determinant for critically injured casualties of these disasters. Furthermore, the data suggest that explosive force, time interval from injury to treatment, and anatomic site of injury are all factors that correlated with the ultimate outcome of terrorist bombing victims. Critical analysis of past disasters should allow for sufficient preparation so as to minimize casualty mortality in the future.\r"

Four hundred sixty-six patients were entered in the clinical trial between June 1976 and September 1981. Tolerance and side effects of preoperative irradiation were acceptable. The overall 5-year survival rates were similar in both groups. When considering only the 341 patients treated by surgery with a curative aim, the 5-year survival rates were 59.1% and 69.1% in the control group and in the combined modality group, respectively (p = 0.08). The local recurrence rates at 5 years were 30% and 15% in the control group and the adjuvant radiotherapy group, respectively (p = 0.003). Although this study did not show preoperative radiotherapy to have a statistically significant benefit on overall survival, it does have a clear effect on local control of rectal cancer. Therefore, before performing radical surgery, this adjuvant therapy should be administered to patients who have locally extended rectal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "A clinical and anatomic study of the spinal accessory, the eleventh cranial nerve, and trapezius muscle function of patients who had radical neck cancer surgery was conducted. This study was done not only to document the indispensibility of the trapezius muscle to shoulder-girdle stability, but also to clarify the role of the eleventh cranial nerve in the variable motor and sensory changes occurring after the loss of this muscle. Seventeen male patients, 49-69 years of age, (average of 60 years of age) undergoing a total of 23 radical neck dissections were examined for upper extremity function, particularly in regard to the trapezius muscle, and for subjective signs of pain. The eleventh nerve, usually regarded as the sole motor innervation to the trapezius, was cut in 17 instances because of tumor involvement. Dissection of four fresh and 30 preserved adult cadavers helped to reconcile the motor and sensory differences in patients who had undergone loss of the eleventh nerve. The dissections and clinical observations corroborate that the trapezius is a key part of a \"muscle continuum\" that stabilizes the shoulder. Variations in origins and insertions of the trapezius may influence its function in different individuals. As regards the spinal accessory nerve, it is concluded that varying motor and sensory connections form a plexus with the eleventh nerve, accounting, in part, for the variations in motor innervation and function of the trapezius, as well as for a variable spectrum of sensory changes when the eleventh nerve is cut. For this reason, it is suggested that the term \"spinal accessory nerve plexus\" be used to refer to the eleventh nerve when it is considered in the context of radical neck cancer surgery.\r"

  ".U": "89049315\r", 
  ".W": "Between March, 1982, and October, 1984, 62 patients underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation in our institution. Immunosuppression was based on cyclosporin A (Cy A) and low-dose steroids with an initial 10-day course of antithymocyte globulin. Follow-up ranged between 39 and 71 months (mean, 51.7 months). Actuarial survival at 1 year through 5 years was 80.6%, 77.4%, 74.2%, 71.4%, and 63.5%, respectively. Graft atheroma led to graft failure in 6 patients, 4 of whom died between 23 and 55 months after transplantation and 2 of whom had a repeat transplantation at 32 and 53 months. Diastolic hypertension (90 mm Hg or higher) developed in 88% of patients at 1 year. Chronic renal impairment was evident in all patients who survived for 2 years. Mean serum creatinine preoperatively and at 1 year through 4 years was 1.49 +/- 0.08 mg/100 ml (+/- the standard error), 2.01 +/- 0.09 mg/100 2.07 +/- 0.09 mg/100 ml, 2.26 +/- 0.19 mg/100 ml, and 2.32 +/- 0.33 mg/100 ml, respectively. End-stage renal failure requiring regular hemodialysis developed in 3 patients, 2 of whom died. We conclude that in addition to graft atheroma, Cy A-related nephrotoxicity is emerging as a major cause of medium-term and long-term morbidity and mortality. The use of lower doses of Cy A in a triple-therapy protocol, that is, Cy A, azathioprine, and low-dose steroids, could help reduce the extent of renal impairment.\r"

  ".W": "Acute renal failure is a most challenging clinical problem when it occurs in pregnancy. It requires an understanding of the normal physiology of the kidney in pregnancy and the natural history of different underlying renal diseases when pregnancy occurs. Because patients with chronic renal disease may present with worsening proteinuria, hypertension, and renal function, these disorders must be excluded from those conditions that cause acute deterioration of renal failure in otherwise normal women during pregnancy. As in all patients who develop acute renal failure, prerenal and obstructive causes must be excluded. Particularly important causes of prerenal azotemia in pregnancy include hyperemesis gravidarum and uterine hemorrhage, especially if it is unsuspected as in abruptio placentae. Infectious causes of acute renal failure in the pregnant woman include acute pyelonephritis and septic abortion. The clinical presentation of both these conditions should be apparent, and appropriate diagnosis and treatment can then be promptly instituted. Renal cortical necrosis is another cause of renal failure that occurs more frequently in pregnancy, and it must be differentiated from the many causes of acute tubular necrosis that may be associated with pregnancy. Those conditions that cause renal failure unique to pregnancy must always be considered when renal function deteriorates in the last trimester or the postpartum period. Severe preeclampsia, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, and idiopathic postpartum acute renal failure may all present similar complications, but the approach to each of these clinical disorders must be individualized. By understanding the causes of renal functional deterioration in pregnancy, a logical differential diagnosis can be established, allowing appropriate therapeutic decisions to preserve both maternal and fetal well-being.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of enalapril maleate and low-dose hydrochlorothiazide therapy on blood pressure and glucose and lipid homeostasis in hypertensive type II diabetic patients, we treated nine of these patients sequentially with placebo, hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d with supplemental potassium chloride), and enalapril (10 to 20 mg/d). Sitting blood pressure fell significantly and to comparable levels with both hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril monotherapy. Enalapril monotherapy was associated with a slight, but not significant, fall in fasting blood glucose levels and with a significant fall in hemoglobin A1c levels. This improved glucose homeostasis could not be explained satisfactorily by changes in peripheral insulin sensitivity or hepatic glucose output, determined with the euglycemic clamp technique, or by changes in fasting serum insulin levels or monocyte insulin binding. In these low doses, hydrochlorothiazide did not worsen glucose homeostasis. Serum total cholesterol levels were significantly lower with enalapril therapy than with hydrochlorothiazide therapy or with placebo, and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels did not change significantly with either treatment. Thus, by providing effective blood pressure control and beneficial metabolic effects, enalapril therapy appears ideal for treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients. Similarly, low-dose hydrochlorothiazide therapy appears to have fewer metabolic complications in these patients and is, therefore, a logical alternative to substitute for, or add to, enalapril therapy.\r"

Evolving evidence suggests that the extent of amphotericin B-induced renal impairment may be modified via alteration of a normal physiologic feedback response that further contributes to changes due to direct nephrotoxicity. As such, renal impairment has a substantial theoretically preventable and reversible element. In animals exposed to amphotericin B, sodium loading interferes with this response. Mounting clinical evidence also supports the usefulness of sodium supplementation to prevent as well as to reverse amphotericin B-induced nephrotoxicity. At this time, the use of sodium supplementation (eg, intravenous saline and/or ticarcillin disodium, which contains 5.2 mEq of sodium per gram of drug) along with avoiding dehydration appears to be a safe and effective means of reducing the risk of nephrotoxicity associated with amphotericin B administration; however, it is not known whether renal changes can be entirely prevented. These preliminary observations merit confirmation in a prospective, randomized clinical trial.\r"

Physicians should be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of the more common screening procedures for drugs of abuse. As a result of recent technical improvements in the instrumentation and reagents used to test for drugs of abuse in urine specimens, these tests, properly performed, are highly accurate for cannabinoids and cocaine, the two most frequently abused drugs; a positive test for opiates and amphetamines is much less specific. By using a two-tiered system of confirmation of positive screening tests that employs techniques such as gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, the incidence of false-positive results is minimal. This article presents guidelines for determining when to order a drug screen; a lexicon of terms commonly used in discussions of screening tests; a description of the advantages, disadvantages, technique, and means of interpreting the more widely used tests; and a section on each of the most frequently abused drugs that describes common errors in test interpretation.\r"

Levels of Mg++ are controlled by the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract and appear closely linked to calcium, potassium, and sodium metabolism. The clinical manifestations and causes of abnormal Mg++ status are protean. Testing for altered Mg++ homeostasis is problematic. Serum levels, which are those generally measured, reflect only a small part of the total body content of Mg++. The intracellular content can be low, despite normal serum levels in a person with clinical Mg++ deficiency. Future directions in research related to intracellular content of Mg++ are discussed. Treatment of altered Mg++ status depends on the clinical setting and may include the addition of a potassium/Mg++-sparing drug to an existing diuretic regimen. Guidelines for therapy are given.\r"

Human immunodeficiency (retro) virus antigens were immunostained in mononuclear macrophages, glial cells, and vascular endothelial cells. Both viral types were found ultrastructurally. The lesions of PML were more destructive than is usually seen in cases without the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The retroviral encephalitis could have occurred before the onset of PML.

The histologic picture was similar in the classic and ID-associated forms of the tumor. In classic KS, a variably dense reactive infiltrate was present, and its amount was inversely related to the age of the lesions; conversely, a scarce reactive infiltrate, with the absence of CD4+ cells, was always evidenced in ID-associated KS lesions, even when the immune status of the patient showed no abnormalities. This evidence supports the hypothesis that a specific impairment of skin-associated lymphoid tissue may be crucial to the development of ID-associated KS.\r"

In addition to routine processing for diagnosis by morphologic recognition of P carinii on a Diff-Quik-stained specimen, the specimen was reacted with a monoclonal antibody to P carinii and visualized in an avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase technique. Of 50 specimens evaluated, there was 94% agreement between results of conventional Diff-Quik staining and immunoperoxidase staining. Two Diff-Quik-positive specimens were negative by immunoperoxidase staining, and one Diff-Quik-negative specimen was positive by immunoperoxidase staining. These discrepancies are most likely attributable to random distribution of P carinii onto smears. The monoclonal antibody used in this study can accurately detect P carinii in induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens.\r"

Cells of a continuous T-cell line (CEM) infected with HIV were inoculated into either Columbia or Middlebrook 7H12 broths, or a combination of an Isolator tube/Middlebrook broth. Virus viability studies were done by removing aliquots from these media at 0, 1, 2, and 7 days and cocultivating them with uninfected CEM cells. The HIV was still viable after two days' incubation in Middlebrook broth and after seven days in Columbia broth. When HIV-infected cells were held in the Isolator blood culture tube for 30 minutes before processing in Middlebrook broth, viable virus was detected only after two and seven days' incubation. However, if infected cells were held in the Isolator tube for 60 or 120 minutes, no virus could be detected after Middlebrook broth incubation. These data suggested that the Isolator system will inactivate HIV if blood from infected patients is held in it for 60 minutes or longer.\r"

  ".W": "The activities of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (PH) and galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase (GGT), both enzymes of collagen biosynthesis, were measured in the gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis anterior muscles of rats after bilateral cast-immobilization of the muscles in lengthened and shortened positions for one and three weeks. The activities of muscular proteolytic and hydrolytic enzymes cathepsin D (CD), beta-glucuronidase (beta-GU), alkaline protease (AP), and the rate of acid autolysis (AA) were also studied. The biochemical results were compared to the morphologic changes by light microscopy. Compared to the results for a control group, there was a decrease of 37% and 53% in the specific PH activity of shortened gastrocnemius and soleus, respectively, after three weeks of immobilization. The corresponding decrease in GGT of the shortened gastrocnemius was 47%. At the same time, PH and GGT in the lengthened plantarflexors were at the control level. The proteolytic activities of the shortened plantarflexors were generally higher (CD by approximately 30%, beta-GU of gastrocnemius by 81%, AP of soleus by 63%, AA of gastrocnemius by 34%, and AA of soleus by 56%) than those of the lengthened ones. Light microscopy of the shortened muscles showed numerous atrophic fibers, but no pronounced inflammatory response in the disused muscle tissue. The results suggest that increased proteolysis and wasting of muscle tissue during cast-immobilization is associated with adaptive responses in the metabolism of the muscular collagen network.\r"

More than half have occurred in the last two years, and current survival rates at one and five years are 81% and 78%, respectively. This increased incidence and survival has been attributed to the advent of cyclosporine as an immunosuppressive agent used to prevent graft rejection. As the obstacles to cardiac transplantation are overcome, more patients will require rehabilitation due to related neurologic sequelae. In the case reported, a 56-year-old man was admitted for rehabilitation of a right hemiparesis and nonfluent aphasia. His medical history was significant for coronary artery disease, multiple myocardial infarctions, and severe congestive heart failure, necessitating a recent orthotopic heart transplant. Although his recuperation from transplant surgery was uncomplicated, he required readmission for treatment of pneumonia and overwhelming infection. He developed hemiparesis and aphasia shortly before his anticipated discharge from this second hospitalization. In therapy, a mild resting tachycardia was noted, with a heart rate increase of 30 beats per minute on two occasions. No other significant change in heart rate or blood pressure occurred during rehabilitation. This altered cardiovascular response to training in self care and mobility skills is typical of the denervated heart's response to exercise. The neurologic complications of heart transplantation, the cardiovascular response of the denervated heart to exercise, and possible implications for physiatrists involved in the care of these patients are discussed.\r"

Numerous studies show that experimental manipulations can lead to growth and plasticity in the adult brain. We have confirmed that growth and plasticity, including neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, can also occur throughout the animal's natural life. New approaches may soon be designed to repopulate injured nervous tissue with appropriate cells. Surgical neural tissue transplantation research is one direction. Another approach involves the inherent plasticity of the nervous system, including neurogenesis, which may be modulated by the rehabilitation plan (the environment) with a variety of possible pharmacological approaches.\r"

  ".W": "I. STRUGGLE FOR IDENTITY. The controversy about the name of the Academy surfaced again soon after the 3rd International Congress in Washington in 1960. Watkins reemphasized the need to pronounce it \"phys-i-a'trist\" and suggested that we be called the American Academy of Physiatrics. Krusen responded by suggesting that the name, American Academy of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation should be retained since the rest of the world wouldn't recognize us. He pointed out that he had just surveyed 40 countries in the developing phase of physical medicine and rehabilitation, and would not want to confuse the issue. Clearly the field of PM&R will be defined by those who practice the specialty. II. LEGISLATION. The legislation initiating Medicare was extraordinarily influential in redefining the specialty. The legislation creating the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation and the subsequent funding of rehabilitation research and training centers engendered an increased awareness in the academic community of the need for rehabilitation medicine. III. CHANGES IN EDUCATION. The Academy gradually increased in number of members, and began to influence the training of residents with the development of a Resident Guide. Many of the senior members of the Academy re-emphasized the need for research to expand new knowledge and all generated a plea for more academic physiatrists. The R&T centers did provide a mechanism to increase the residency training. The role of the physiatrist in the medical school was defined and promoted in colleague with other specialties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of those very early leaders, John S. Coulter, Frank H. Krusen, William Bierman, and Richard Kovacs stand out for their inspirational and conceptual leadership regarding the potentials of physiatry. The field will forever be indebted to Walter J. Zeiter for his administrative and executive abilities. Howard A. Rusk earned the approbation \"Father of Rehabilitation Medicine\" when he first demonstrated that rehabilitation of the ill and injured made it possible to restore meaning to life and at the same time reduce the duration and costs of disability. Finally, it is important that we appreciate the role George C. Deaver played as the progenitor, or perhaps \"Grandfather\" of physical medicine and rehabilitation. Although he was not an organization man--and in fact appears to have shunned them--he was the first physiatrist to use all the available tools of PM&R to rehabilitate the spinal cord injured, the patients with cerebral palsy, with the muscular dystrophies, with multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. At a time when these patients were being rejected and discarded as permanently disabled, Deaver was accepting them and patiently working with them to achieve the best possible outcomes through rehabilitation. And now, on to the 1950s. . .\r"

The contributions of certain individuals have been mentioned throughout this article, but a few have provided the essential continuity of effort in federal advocacy for the handicapped and PM&R. In my experience, this distinguished list of advocates has included Rusk, Kottke, Lowman, Lehmann, Spencer, Ditunno and Materson. These individuals were either defacto or dejure chairs of Academy of ACRM legislative and health policy committees from the 1960s to the present. They devoted endless hours of volunteer work on behalf of the handicapped and PM&R. In addition, Rusk and Betts have been magnificent in attracting the public's attention to the needs of the disabled. The dedication, passion, sense of justice and persistence of all these men have served PM&R, the handicapped and the public admirably. The field of PM&R will always produce leaders of such quality, given its basic commitment to the needs of the handicapped and disabled and its passion for patient advocacy and social justice. It is my wish to dedicate this article, to the extent it is accurate, intelligent and well written, to Edward Lowman, MD, now deceased, who was a key link in the chain of advocacy. If the article is not perceived as described, it would not be appropriate to dedicate it to this man. Dr. Lowman was always all of those things.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A placebo-controlled study was conducted in 25 patients (mean age, 67 years) with congenital or acquired heart disease undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were divided into three groups: Group 1 patients were given 50 mg of TP-5 subcutaneously two hours preoperatively. Group 2 patients were given 50 mg of TP-5 subcutaneously two hours preoperatively and 48 hours postoperatively. Group 3 patients were given placebo at corresponding times. Cell-mediated immunity measurements were the in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response on day 0 and on day 7 to an antigen skin test battery. The in vitro studies included antigen cocktail-induced lymphocyte proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The DTH response on day 7 after surgery was significantly suppressed in group 3 patients compared with the preoperative baseline value, while it remained unaltered in group 1 and 2 patients. There was a considerable difference of DTH measurements (number of positive antigen responses and sum of their mean diameters) between group 2 and 3 patients. Antigen cocktail-induced lymphocyte proliferation, following initial suppression in the majority of patients, was significantly different between the placebo group and patients in group 2 on day 7 after surgery. The data indicate that perioperative administration of TP-5 might be of considerable clinical utility in preventing a defective cellular immune response.\r"

Significantly fewer MNCs were delivered to skin window chambers placed over purified protein derivative (PPD) injection sites of previously sensitized anergic patients compared with hospitalized PPD-reactive patients; coinjection of CK with PPD restored the MNC delivery in anergic patients to normal levels. The T cells cloned from a PPD + CK site of an anergic patient consisted of CD4+ and CD8+ cells whose capacities included cytotoxicity and lymphokine production. The frequency of PPD-reactive cells was 15 times greater than in the blood. Thus, the restoration by CK of the delivery of antigen-specific cells capable of participating in cell-mediated immunity in anergic patients may be feasible.\r"

However, a cytokine-rich supernatant generated in the mixed lymphocyte culture reaction is able to induce an early skin reaction that peaks at 12 hours and wanes by 24 hours in some, but not all, anergic patients. Assessment of the clinical course of these patients demonstrated that only three of 25 patients who had a skin reaction larger than 5 mm died, compared with ten of 16 patients who failed to display this early reaction. Further analysis showed that both the cytokine-induced reaction and the acute physiology score significantly and independently contributed to the probability of death in anergic patients. These data suggest that the ability to generate a local inflammatory response to cytokines in anergic patients identifies a subpopulation of patients who have maintained some host-defense responsiveness and this response can be utilized to predict outcome.\r"

  ".W": "This study assessed the effect of early vs delayed postburn wound excision and skin grafting on the in vivo neutrophil delivery to a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction and a bacterial skin lesion (BSL). Male Lewis rats were presensitized to keyhole-limpet hemocyanin. Group 1 comprised sham controls. Groups 2 through 4 were given a 30% 3 degrees scald burn, but the burn wounds were excised, and skin was grafted on days 1, 3, and 7, respectively, after the burn. Group 5 comprised burn controls. Twelve days after burn trauma, all rats were injected at different intervals (during a 24-hour period) with a trio of intradermal injections of keyhole-limpet hemocyanin, Staphylococcus aureus 502A, and saline at different sites. In vivo neutrophil delivery to these dermal lesions was determined by injecting indium in 111 oxyquinoline-labeled neutrophils isolated from similarly treated groups of rats. Neutrophil delivery to DTH and BSL lesions was restored to normal by excision and skin grafting of the burn wound one day after burn trauma. Waiting three days after burn trauma to excise and skin graft the wound partially, but not completely, restored the in vivo neutrophil delivery to DTH and BSL lesions. Waiting one week to excise and skin graft a burn wound resulted in no improvement in neutrophil delivery to DTH and BSL dermal lesions. It was concluded that burn wound excision and skin grafting immediately after burn trauma restored in vivo neutrophil delivery to a BSL and DTH dermal lesion. This may, in part, explain the beneficial effect of early aggressive burn wound debridement in patients with burn injuries.\r"

This study investigated superoxide production by circulating and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) PMNs in a rat model of ARDS induced by chronic Escherichia coli (lipopolysaccharide) endotoxemia. Superoxide production was stimulated by fmet-leu-phe, opsonized zymosan, and phorbol myristate acetate. Circulating and BAL PMNs from lipopolysaccharide-infused rats compared with PMNs from control rats are primed for nonselective increased superoxide production. The BAL PMNs are not only partially primed to release superoxide on adherence, they concomitantly have a depressed superoxide response to a phagocytic (opsonized zymosan) stimulus. These PMN responses may partially explain both the pulmonary injury and the increased susceptibility to pulmonary infection seen in patients with ARDS.\r"

One hundred seventy-two RTCs were treated and subsequently underwent transplantation and followed up for at least one year and up to five years after transplantation. Eighty-eight RTCs received vaccine, and 84 received placebo. Results were analyzed according to the prevaccination serologic status (anti-CMV antibody titer) of the recipient (R- or R+) and the donor (D- or D+). The overall incidence of CMV disease was highest in the R-D+ group and almost absent in the R-D- group. There was no difference in the incidence of CMV infection or disease between vaccinated and respective placebo control recipients in either the R-D+, R+D+, R+D-, or R-D- groups. In contrast, the severity of CMV disease was significantly decreased in R-D+ vaccinees vs R-D+ placebo-treated recipients. Moreover, in the R-D+ group, one- and five-year cadaver renal allograft actuarial survival rates were 73% and 62%, respectively, for CMV vaccinees vs 40% and 25%, respectively, for control placebo patients. We conclude that seronegative cadaver RTCs may benefit from vaccination with live, attenuated, Towne strain CMV vaccine before transplantation.\r"

These abnormalities occurred independent of the time of death and were also found in patients who died of brain injury alone. The most pronounced signs of inflammation and increases in organ weights were found when the adult respiratory distress syndrome, hypovolemic shock, or multiple organ failure were the causes of death. These findings are similar to those found in several organs of rabbits after four hours of complement activation in combination with 20 minutes of hypoxia. Therefore, the autopsy findings in this series of trauma patients might represent the morphologic features of adult respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure in an early, preclinical stage.\r"

Prior to Destroyers, Head published two other volumes of poetry and, in 1922, he wrote an introduction to a collection of works by Thomas Hardy, compiled by his equally literate wife, Ruth. That the literary influence between the Heads was mutual is revealed by the many references to medicine and physicians in the novels of Ruth Head.

We examined the corneal buttons of 12 patients, who had clinical features of macular dystrophy, by histochemical staining, transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical techniques. All corneas exhibited positive staining with Muller Mowry's colloidal iron. Using monoclonal antibodies 1/20/5-D-4, J-10, J-19, and J-36 that recognize specific sites on the sulfated keratan sulfate molecule, we stained corneal sections by an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method and identified two groups of macular corneal dystrophy. One group consisting of four corneas reacted positively with all four antibodies, and the other group consisting of eight corneas did not react with any of the antibodies used. These results confirmed those recently presented by Yang et al that there may be subgroups of macular dystrophy that can be identified by immunohistochemical methods. Also, serum levels of sulfated keratan sulfate were determined in seven patients. One patient who displayed a normal level of serum keratan sulfate had positive corneal immunoreactivity. Of the six patients who lacked serum keratan sulfate, four showed negative and two had positive corneal immunostaining, suggesting at least three subgroups in the disease. An attempt was made to correlate the clinical features, histochemical-staining characteristics, and ultrastructural morphology with the immunoreactivity to keratan sulfate antibodies, but no correlations could be made.\r"

In contrast, SLE sera actually bound to fewer E coli proteins than did the sera obtained from normal controls, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was no correlation between the number of E coli proteins and HeLa proteins recognized by individual SLE sera, and there was no trend toward reactivity with a larger number of antigens in sera containing higher levels of IgG. IgG from SLE sera did not bind to 6 purified eukaryotic protein standards (selected solely on the basis of differences in size and charge) either in their denatured state or in their native state. These findings indicate that the high levels of IgG antibodies against selected eukaryotic intracellular proteins in patients with SLE cannot be explained by a random polyclonal B cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "The traditional concept of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a circulation-borne endocrine system, the components of which are secreted by various organs. The product of this biochemical cascade, angiotensin II, acts on specific receptors on multiple target organs. Activation of this circulating system has been shown to result in vasoconstriction and hypertension. In addition to this endocrine system, evidence is emerging that the renin-angiotensin system also exists at multiple local tissue sites. Recent data demonstrating that inhibitors of the RAS are capable of lowering blood pressure in the presence of suppressed as well as elevated plasma renin activity (PRA) have given rise to the hypothesis that these inhibitors exert a large part of their effect on angiotensin that is synthesized by and contained in local tissues. The concept implies that local angiotensin concentrations may exceed those of plasma levels and may play an important role in the tonic control of vascular resistance, cardiac and adrenal functions, and intrarenal events. The hypothesis could explain the broad spectrum of activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in hypertensives as well as their continuing antihypertensive activity after plasma ACE levels have been restored.\r"

Because converting-enzyme inhibition appeared promising in early studies, we reviewed and analyzed the records of 269 patients with documented renovascular hypertension who were treated with captopril in worldwide trials. Captopril produced complete control of blood pressure in 74% of patients assessed at three months and partial control in an additional 8%. Thirteen percent of patients were discontinued for side effects that occurred, in part, due to the aggressive early captopril-dosing regimen. The drug was clearly ineffective in only 5% of patients. Progressive renal failure sufficient to warrant discontinuation of treatment occurred in only 5% of patients, generally in association with bilateral disease or a solitary kidney. Diagnostic and treatment issues are discussed. Medical therapy with a converting-enzyme inhibitor represents a viable alternative in selected patients with renovascular hypertension, especially those in whom there is a contraindication to surgery or angioplasty.\r"

Second, an exaggerated rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) after short-term captopril administration is a very promising screening test for this condition. Third, ACEI-induced changes in single-kidney hemodynamics (assessed by renography) may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and offers the prospect of localizing the ischemic kidney.\r"

  ".W": "Although the value of treating all degrees of hypertension has been clearly established, a substantial percentage of patients fail to comply with drug therapy and thus do not receive the long-term benefits of blood pressure reduction. Antihypertensive drugs can have a negative impact on the patient's overall quality of life, as judged by their physical state, emotional well-being, cognitive acuity, and sexual and social functioning. These effects can be quite troubling to patients with a seemingly symptomless disease. In order to examine more closely the effects of different antihypertensive agents on quality of life, a double-blind, multicenter trial was conducted in which male patients were assigned to treatment with either methyldopa, propranolol or captopril for six months. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to the primary drug in patients whose blood pressure was not adequately controlled after eight weeks. Quality of life was evaluated using a battery of validated psychological assessment scales and indexes. Captopril was favored over methyldopa and propranolol on a number of the quality of life measures, including general well-being, physical symptoms, and sexual dysfunction. Addition of a diuretic negatively affected quality of life in all three primary drug groups, but captopril was still favored over the other primary drugs even when the effect of the diuretic was considered. The study demonstrated that quality of life is relevant and assessable and can be influenced by the choice of drug therapy. Greater attention by physicians to quality of life issues can hopefully improve patient compliance and extend the benefits of long-term antihypertensive therapy to more patients.\r"

In addition to hypertension, other major cardiovascular risk factors include left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), dyslipoproteinemia, and glucose intolerance. Thus, the effects of agents used to treat hypertension on these risk factors are of considerable importance. Large therapeutic intervention trials have shown that while adequate treatment of mild hypertension significantly and consistently reduces all-cause mortality as well as the risk of stroke and congestive heart failure, an anticipated reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) has not been demonstrated. It is possible adverse metabolic side effects (hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia) of widely used agents, such as diuretics and beta-blockers may be partially offsetting the beneficial effects of blood pressure reduction, with the net result being a failure of these agents to reduce the risk of CHD. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and calcium channel blockers do not produce these adverse metabolic derangements. The use of antihypertensive agents that have favorable or neutral metabolic effects should further reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality attributable to high blood pressure, including CHD.\r"

Sympatholytics, beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, and direct vasodilators may not be tolerated. The angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, are good choices because they have favorable hemodynamics, renin and nonrenin-dependent mechanisms of action and are associated with minimal biochemical alterations. In a recent multicenter study, captopril (25 mg twice daily) was given to 99 geriatric patients with seated diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 92-110 mm Hg. Patients whose blood pressures were not controlled after two weeks of therapy were randomized to either Capozide (captopril, 25 mg with 15 mg hydrochlorothiazide) or captopril, 50 mg twice daily. The average decrease in BP was 16.9/11.9 mm Hg; 75.8% of patients responded to treatment. Black and white patients had equal responses. Only five patients withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions, none of which was serious. Geriatric hypertensives should be treated. Because captopril and Capozide are well-tolerated, effective medications in elderly patients with mild, moderate, or severe hypertension, they should be considered as initial therapy for geriatric hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic hypertension is both the cause and the consequence of renal disease. Experimental studies suggest that the adverse effects of systemic hypertension on the progression of renal disease may depend upon the intraglomerular hemodynamic consequences. Systemic hypertension accompanied by afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction is associated with normal glomerular capillary pressure and relative protection against morphologic injury. In contrast, systemic hypertension with afferent arteriolar vasodilatation leads to glomerular hypertension and is associated with structural injury. Glomerular hypertension may be present even in the setting of normal systemic pressure, as in experimental diabetes. Therapeutic interventions that attenuate glomerular capillary hypertension slow the development of glomerular injury. Dietary protein restriction, which normalizes glomerular capillary filtration, perfusion, and pressure without lowering blood pressure, retards the development of glomerular sclerosis. Alternatively, selective reduction of glomerular capillary pressure with converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy is also protective against progressive renal injury. In contrast, antihypertensive therapy, which controls systemic hypertension but does not reduce glomerular capillary pressure, fails to protect remnant kidney rats from glomerular injury. These studies suggest that control of glomerular hypertension may be of special benefit to the patient with progressive renal disease.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus increases the risk of both macrovascular and microvascular complications. Such microvascular complications as diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy are accelerated in the presence of arterial hypertension. Evidence suggests that the complications of diabetes mellitus begin early in the course of the disorder as manifested by microalbuminuria and increased vascular reactivity. These findings are accompanied by changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system including reductions in plasma renin activity. These changes could be secondary to volume expansion that may be a direct consequence of elevated blood glucose, suggesting that the metabolic disorder in diabetes contributes to the etiology of hypertension in these patients. Adequate treatment of hypertension is crucial to the prevention of complications; however, many antihypertensive agents have limited usefulness in diabetes mainly because of their unfavorable side effects. Diuretics lower blood pressure in hypertensive diabetics, but their metabolic effects are especially undesirable in this population. beta-Blockers alter glucose and lipid metabolism in diabetic patients and reduce regional blood flow. Central acting agents and alpha-blockers are often associated with orthostatic hypotension, sexual dysfunction, and central nervous system side effects. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) such as captopril effectively lower blood pressure in diabetic patients and have few unwanted effects. They may improve metabolic control and have favorable effects on glucose metabolism. The ACEIs also produce improved regional hemodynamics which may lead to the improvement in or prevention of the progression of diabetic nephropathy.\r"

Ten years later, investigations began with the first orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), captopril, in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). Subsequent studies have definitively demonstrated that ACEIs produce symptomatic and exercise tolerance improvement in patients with moderate and severe CHF. This favorable experience led to the investigation of captopril in patients with milder symptoms in whom the goals of treatment must be defined more rigorously. An optimal agent for this patient group would not only reduce symptoms, but improve prognosis and have demonstrable advantages over existing treatments. A growing body of investigational data and clinical experience indicates that the ACEIs achieve these goals. As a result, they are being used with increasing frequency in patients with milder grades of heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "A multicentred, randomised, blind study was started in 1978 to compare propranolol or hyaluronidase with placebo in patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted within 18 hours of onset of symptoms. Patients were randomised to group A and received hyaluronidase, propranolol, or placebo, or, if propranolol was contraindicated, to group B and received hyaluronidase or placebo. Hyaluronidase (500 U/kg given every six hours for 48 hours) had no effect on mortality or infarct size in the overall population. Because spontaneous reperfusion was more common in patients with early peaking of plasma creatine kinase MB or non-transmural electrocardiographic changes or both, the results were reanalysed for two subgroups: those in whom plasma creatine kinase peaked less than 15 hours after the onset of symptoms (early peak, n = 184) and those with a peak greater than 15 h after the onset of symptoms (late peak, n = 546). The distribution of time to peak activity of creatine kinase MB was similar in the hyaluronidase and placebo groups. In the early peak patients who were given hyaluronidase (groups A and B) total mortality and cardiac-specific four year mortality were significantly lower. This was most pronounced in group B in which the total mortality was 45% and cardiovascular mortality was 47% less than in the placebo group. Similarly, mortality from cardiovascular disease in patients (groups A and B) with nontransmural ischaemia (ST-T changes) given hyaluronidase was significantly lower, with group B showing a 50% reduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eight patients presented with sick sinus syndrome and, with one exception, retrograde atrioventricular conduction and eight age and sex matched patients presented with 2:1 or complete atrioventricular block. Maximal symptom limited exercise in those with atrioventricular block was significantly higher after one month of DDD pacing than after VVI pacing. In those with sick sinus syndrome, however, maximal effort tolerance was not significantly different for the two pacing modes. In all but one patient with sick sinus syndrome sinus rhythm developed during exercise in VVI pacing. For both VVI and DDD modes maximal atrial rates were significantly lower in those with sick sinus syndrome. Palpitation and general wellbeing were significantly improved during DDD pacing in the eight patients with sick sinus syndrome. Shortness of breath was improved by DDD pacing in the eight patients with atrioventricular block but not in those with sick sinus syndrome. Holter monitoring showed that sick sinus syndrome patients remained in paced rhythm, either DDD or VVI, for most of the 24 hour period. DDD pacing was better than VVI pacing in sick sinus syndrome with retrograde atrioventricular conduction. Despite their ability to show sinus rhythm and inhibit their pacemakers on exercise patients with sick sinus syndrome are just as likely to have symptomatic benefit from DDD pacing as patients with atrioventricular block.\r"

Diastolic blood pressure below 86 mmHg was obtained in a similar proportion of women given labetalol or methyldopa. Intrauterine death occurred in four women treated with methyldopa, and the one neonatal death on day 1 occurred in the labetalol group. The average birthweight and the proportion of preterm or small-for-gestational-age babies were similar in both groups. Heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, respiratory rate, and Silverman score of the babies did not differ between the two treatment groups, whether the comparison was made for all the infants, or only for those that were preterm or small-for-gestational-age. These data indicate that maternal beta-blockade with labetalol is as safe as methyldopa for the fetus and the newborn.\r"

Rubeosis was noted in 13 of the 16 eyes, and this may assist in making the diagnosis. The World Health Organisation histological classification of medulloepithelioma was applied, but some problems were encountered, particularly where the presence of heteroplastic brain tissue was used as a criterion for teratoid tumour and where rosettes were used as a criterion for malignancy.\r"

Doppler signals were detected from 48 of 55 hepatocellular carcinomas (87.3%), seven of 25 metastatic liver cancers (28.0%) and four of 30 haemangiomas (13.3%). The waveforms of Doppler signals were divided into two types: the pulsatile wave, which was detected from hepatocellular carcinoma (in 35 of the 48 with Doppler signals) and metastatic liver cancer (in all seven with positive signals), and the continuous wave, which was seen from hepatocellular carcinoma (41 out of 48) and haemangioma (in all four with signals). In six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent transcatheter arterial embolization, the pulsatile wave detected before therapy disappeared immediately thereafter and it is possible that this type of wave originates from tumour vessels. In the study of small, hypoechoic, mass lesions appearing in liver cirrhosis, such signals were also demonstrated, even in eight of 10 small hepatocellular carcinomas less than 2 cm in diameter, whilst they were not detected from nine regenerative nodules related to cirrhotic change. In conclusion, the Doppler ultrasound method may be a useful technique in detecting blood flow within liver tumours and may offer the possibility of a differential diagnosis of small tumours.\r"

Venous and arterial DSA always gave diagnostically useful images. Intravenous DSA is valuable in patients with suspected renovascular hypertension or after vascular surgery, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and transcatheter embolisation. Arterial DSA is preferable to venous DSA in other clinical situations, particularly in the evaluation of renal tumours, and may be recommended in preference to conventional angiography.\r"

Twenty-nine control patients had identical evaluations before and 6 months after surgery which did not involve the urethrovesical junction. Twenty-four patients with primary bladder instability had similar evaluations and served as a second control group. Anatomical landmarks indicating support to the urethrovesical junction were evaluated by the position of the urethra at the most dependent point in the bladder on straining and the urethral descent on straining to beneath the posterior ramus of the symphysis pubis on bead chain cystography. The urethrovesical junction drop on straining was evaluated by transrectal ultrasonography. Cystographic and ultrasonographic tests for the position of the urethrovesical junction at the most dependent position in the bladder during straining were very sensitive in women with stress urinary incontinence (94 and 87% respectively) but much less specific (45 and 48% respectively). When evaluating anatomical support to the urethrovesical junction and its descent on straining, these tests were both highly sensitive (97 and 94% respectively) and specific (76 and 96% respectively) in women with genuine stress urinary incontinence. Simple clinical tests for support of the urethrovesical junction, such as the Q tip test, are non-specific in patients with stress urinary incontinence. Transrectal ultrasonography is a simple and quick out-patient procedure. The availability of ultrasound equipment in most clinics and the high sensitivity and specificity of the test make it an attractive and cost-effective alternative to X-ray cystography in the pre-operative evaluation of anatomical support to the urethrovesical junction.\r"

Ultrasonography provided accurate real-time imaging of the bladder neck, prostatic urethra and external sphincter during the bladder filling phase as well as during the voiding phase. Bladder and rectal pressures, sphincter EMG and uroflow were recorded simultaneously. Transrectal ultrasonography contributed significantly to the accuracy of diagnosing detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. Sphincter contractions were clearly visualised with ultrasonographic video monitoring. This imaging method was especially helpful in sorting out the problems of 3 patients with poor emptying of bladder after endoscopic sphincterotomy. One had a urethral stricture and the other 2 had sphincters that opened adequately but bladders that emptied poorly because of detrusor hypocontractility. Other problems, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and false passage, were also easily recognised. Transrectal ultrasonography not only provides accurate information but also involves no exposure to radiation and thus precludes the need for costly lead-shielded examination rooms.\r"

  ".U": "89051694\r", 
  ".W": "Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is the most common cause of blindness in Canada, and, as the name suggests, its incidence increases rapidly with age. Atrophic maculopathy, one of the forms of ARMD, is associated with only mild to moderate visual loss but is not treatable. On the other hand, exudative maculopathy, another form, is characterized by the formation of neovascular membranes and causes acute visual disturbances; however, it is potentially treatable by means of laser photocoagulation. In symptomatic patients blood, lipids or serous fluid seen on funduscopic examination indicates occult neovascularization, even if no neovascular membrane is visible. In asymptomatic patients their age, the presence of soft drusen and the coarse pigmentary disturbance have the greatest correlation with the risk of neovascularization. Suitability for laser photocoagulation depends on the stage of exudative maculopathy, the duration of symptoms and the patient's visual acuity. Therefore, family physicians must know what the earliest symptoms are and how to identify patients at highest risk so that intervention in terms of education, screening and prompt referral to an ophthalmologist for confirmation and subsequent treatment can be instituted.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have reviewed their experience using the antigranulocyte marker, anti-Leu-M1, in combination with the antileukocyte marker, PD7/26, applied to paraffin sections of malignant lymphomas difficult to subclassify using morphologic criteria. The study group consisted of 73 lymphomas; 53 cases of Hodgkin's disease and 20 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Leu-M1 was expressed by the Reed-Sternberg and Hodgkin's cells in 33 (62%) of the cases of Hodgkin's disease. The Reed-Sternberg and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in four cases of lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease were Leu-M1 negative. The Reed-Sternberg cells and L&H cells expressed leukocyte common antigen, utilizing the monoclonal antibody PD7/26, in seven (13%) of the 53 cases including the four cases of lymphocyte-predominant subtype (three nodular, one diffuse). The Reed-Sternberg-like cells in four (20%) of the cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were stained by anti-Leu-M1 whereas, in 12 cases (60%) these cells were stained by PD7/26. The combination of anti-Leu-M1 and PD7/26 provided more useful information than that provided by anti-Leu-M1 alone by providing immunologic support for the diagnosis of lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease and by identifying cases which stained with neither antibody. The authors interpret the immunologic findings in the latter cases as equivocal. These studies were most helpful in cases with many atypical cells and provided unequivocal support for the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease in six of 11 cases of the \"syncytial variant,\" a form of the nodular sclerosing type characterized by cohesive aggregates of Reed-Sternberg cells and lacunar variants, not uncommonly misdiagnosed using only morphologic criteria.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred seventy-four evaluable patients with noninflammatory Stage III (both operable and inoperable) breast cancer were treated with a combined modality strategy between 1974 and 1985. All patients received combination chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), and cyclophosphamide (FAC) as their initial form of therapy. After three cycles of chemotherapy, local treatment in the form of a total mastectomy with axillary dissection, or radiotherapy, or both, was completed. Subsequently, adjuvant chemotherapy was continued. There were 48 patients with Stage IIIA, and 126 patients with Stage IIIB disease. A complete remission was achieved in 16.7% of the patients, and 70.7% achieved a partial remission after the initial three cycles of FAC. The complete response rate was higher for patients with Stage IIIA, than for patients with Stage IIIB disease. All but six of the 174 patients treated were rendered disease-free after induction chemotherapy and local treatment. The median follow-up of this group of patients is 59 months. The 5-year disease-free survival rates were 84% for patients with Stage IIIA, and 33% for patients with Stage IIIB disease. The 5-year survival rate for, patients with Stage IIIA was 84%, and for patients with Stage IIIB 44%. At 10 years, 56% of patients with Stage IIIA and 26% of patients with Stage IIIB disease are projected to be alive. Younger patients, and those with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, had a trend for better survival than older patients and those with estrogen receptor-negative tumors. The quality of response to induction chemotherapy correlated prominently with prognosis, as did compliance with treatment. Twenty-six patients (15.3%) had locoregional recurrence. This multidisciplinary approach to locally advanced breast cancer rendered most patients disease-free and produced an excellent local control rate. Modifications of this treatment strategy may result in further improvement of survival rates.\r"

Electron microscopic examination showed microfilament bundles with dense patches and discontinuous basal lamina. Desmin, vimentin, and actin were positive for tumor cells, and cytokeratin, thyroglobulin, and calcitonin were negative. In contrast, the anaplastic carcinoma cases did not contain microfilament bundles with dense patches in their tumor cells. There were no desmin-positive or cytokeratin-negative tumor cells. We concluded that this case was a primary leiomyosarcoma, presumably derived from the smooth muscle cell of the vascular wall.\r"

The analysis was based on 116,858 incidents, invasive cancer cases occurring between 1973 and 1982 in black and white, male and female residents of the Detroit metropolitan area. Cases were drawn from the population-based Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System. The results indicate that racial differences in age-specific incidence rates for many forms of cancer are more pronounced when cancer occurs in early adulthood and middle age (20 to 44 and 45 to 54 years) than in persons aged 65 and over. This is especially the case for male subjects. This may suggest that blacks and whites who survive to their senior years before developing cancer may be more alike in terms of behavior, exposures, or host susceptibility than blacks and whites for whom cancer occurs in early adulthood or middle age. The etiologic and public health implications of these race and age patterns must be considered in greater detail. Future case-control studies should include sufficient numbers of patients in both the youngest and oldest age groups to ensure that black and white differences can be adequately examined by age at diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-four cases of primary laryngeal moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Otolaryngic Tumor Registry (AFIP-OTR) are reported. The tumors most often present in men in their sixth and seventh decades of life and are heralded by an array of symptoms, the most frequent being hoarseness. The primary site was most often the supraglottic larynx. The investigation has included light-microscopic, histochemical, immunocytochemical, and electron microscopic analyses which support expression of both neuroendocrine and epithelial differentiation. Conservative surgery alone can be utilized if early identification of the tumor and complete surgical removal are assured. The follow-up of the patients reveals 62% as remaining tumor-free after surgical extirpation over periods ranging from 1 month to 16 years (median: 3 years, 9 months). Factors adversely affecting prognosis include metastatic disease at initial presentation, incomplete surgical removal, and vascular or lymphatic invasion. There was no correlation between tumor size, morphologic pattern, mitoses or necrosis, and survival. Sixty-eight percent of the patients gave a history of long-term cigarette smoking. The classification and pathogenesis of these neoplasms remains the focus of much speculation. They are suggested as arising from the cells of the dispersed neuroendocrine system (DNES). However, a more uniform and descriptive nomenclature is necessary. This study resolves this and other issues along with a presentation of clinicopathologic data of the tumor entity.\r"

In brachial plexus injuries, extraplexal nerves such as the spinal accessory nerve, rami of the cervical plexus, or intercostal nerves are transferred onto trunks, cords, or individual nerves or else segments of the brachial plexus that maintain continuity with the spinal cord may be coapted to trunks or cords the surgeon wishes to innervate. This method is particularly indicated in root avulsion injuries that occur frequently following traction trauma to the brachial plexus. The authors convey their experience with neurotization using the long thoracic nerve in seven cases, the accessory nerve in 30 cases, intercostal nerves in 66 cases, and various nerve transfers within the plexus in 31 cases. Results of other authors are also reported. With these methods, it is possible to obtain good elbow flexion in more than one-half of patients; however, only limited shoulder function and no useful finger function are obtained.\r"

When early reconstructive surgery was successful, a significant decrease in pain occurred more frequently. For 57% of patients with pain, a plurimodal medical treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and behavioral therapy efficiently reduced pain. For the patients with unbearable paroxystic pain, when medical treatment failed, the destruction of deafferented dorsal horns at the level of avulsion (Nashold procedure) could produce pain relief.

There were significant increases in serum beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate 5 and 15 h after the start of the MCT-LCT infusions. Increases were seen only after 15 h of NS, while none was observed during LCT alone. Triglycerides were increased in a dose-related fashion with MCT-LCT and were increased even further with LCT alone. Glycerol increased in a dose-related fashion both during the MCT-LCT and LCT infusion beginning immediately (0.5 h) after the start of the infusion. With NS infusion, glycerol increased significantly only after 15 h of infusion. The MCT-LCT mixture and the highest LCT dose resulted in a significant (12%) increase in oxygen consumption after 5 h of infusion. There was no difference in oral glucose tolerance between the various infusions. Infusion of MCT results in significant ketogenesis and more study is needed to determine its clinical utility.\r"

Infants in the CLD group had significantly lower birth weights (BW) (p less than .001) and gestational ages (p less than .01) than those in the non-CLD group. There was no difference in the incidence of intrathoracic airleak or symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus. Of the CLD group, 74% were intubated compared with 35% in the non-CLD group (p less than .002). There was no difference between the groups in the morbidity score of initial pulmonary disease or in the duration of ventilation with various pressures and oxygen concentrations. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that intubated infants were 4.8 times more likely to develop CLD than nonintubated infants, and infants with low BW had a 3.2-fold greater risk of developing the disease.\r"

  ".W": "During treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), optimal re-expansion of lung units with minimal work of breathing is best accomplished when the airway pressure (Paw) is kept constant at the desired CPAP level throughout the entire breathing cycle. To achieve this, a new device was constructed in which CPAP was generated by a jet of fresh gas close to the nasal airway. The performance of the new device was investigated experimentally using a lung model which simulated the breathing pattern of a newborn. Paw, flow, and external work of breathing were measured at three CPAP levels, with and without controlled airway leakage. The new device was compared with a traditional continuous-flow CPAP system with standard nasal prongs. Despite a virtually constant pressure within the traditional system, Paw variations and external workload were considerably less with the new device, which was also less sensitive to airway leakage.\r"

The prevalence of chronic bronchitis and chronic wheezing varied with sex (greater in men) and smoking history (greatest in current smokers). The prevalence of chronic bronchitis varied depending on whether it was (1) defined simply as chronic production of sputum, (2) diagnosed by the examining physician, or (3) previously diagnosed by a physician. Dyspnea was more common in women; in men, it was least common in nonsmokers but was of similar prevalence in ex-smokers and current smokers. Angina was more commonly reported by women, but previously diagnosed heart attack was consistently more common in men. Wheezing was by far the most common physical sign, present in 5.1 percent of the total population and 9.2 percent of male current smokers. Clubbing and rales were each noted in 1.2 percent of the total population. The prevalences of clinical findings in this cross section of a large state should be useful for comparison with other populations.\r"

Bronchorrhea sputum differed from saliva in its chemical parameters. Bronchorrhea sputum exhibited parameter values intermediate between those of saliva and mucoid sputum, except for the two following parameters. The pH of bronchorrhea sputum was significantly lower than that of mucoid sputum and histamine concentration, expressed as weight per dry weight of sample, was significantly higher in bronchorrhea than in mucoid sputum. Administration of corticosteroid or an histamine H1-blocker to five to nine asthmatic patients with associated bronchorrhea sputum during asthmatic attacks, significantly reduced the volume of bronchorrhea sputum, whereas anticholinergics and H2-blocker did not alter the sputum volume.\r"

All patients received adequate antituberculosis chemotherapy (isoniazid, 300 mg/day; rifampin, 450 mg/day; ethambutol, 20 mg/kg/day) for more than nine months. They were randomly assigned to take prednisolone 0.75 mg/kg/day orally or placebo for the initial treatment, which was tapered gradually for the next two to three months. Twenty-one were treated with steroids and 19 were given a placebo. The two groups were identical with regard to age, sex, duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, and initial amount of pleural effusion. The mean duration from symptoms (fever, chest pain, dyspnea) to relief was 2.4 days in the steroid-treated group, and 9.2 days in the placebo group (p less than 0.05). Complete reabsorption of pleural effusion occurred an average of 54.5 days in the steroid-treated group and 123.2 days in the placebo group (p less than 0.01). The development of residual pleural thickening was not influenced by the administration of corticosteroids. No serious side effects were noted during the treatment in either group. We conclude that the administration of corticosteroids, in conjunction with antituberculosis chemotherapy, will resolve the clinical symptoms more quickly and hasten the absorption of pleural effusion in patients with tuberculous pleurisy.\r"

Movement of the tumor during breathing was synchronized with that of the chest wall. We believe that the ultrasonography is of value in identifying tumors that are localized to the chest wall by examination of their margin and movement with respiration, in addition to their shape. Using UGAB, we were able to diagnose correctly all eight metastatic tumors and two of four benign tumors. UGAB is a safe and simple procedure for diagnosing chest wall tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous investigators have demonstrated that responses to exercise testing enable prediction of the severity of underlying coronary disease and the patient's prognosis. However, exercise testing cannot predict angiographic findings or a poor prognosis with absolute certainty. Because survival can only be improved in specific clinical subsets of patients, it is important to carefully select for catheterization those in whom intervention can improve both quality and quantity of life. To deliver cost-effective health care, an effort has been made to use decision analysis to select those who should undergo cardiac catheterization. Decision analysis depends on reliable information regarding the predictive accuracy of the exercise test. Thus, this review is timely. Recent studies investigating the prognostic value of the exercise test are reviewed in this monograph. Patients include those recovering from a recent myocardial infarction (MI), those with stable coronary heart disease (including studies that have considered coronary angiographic findings, cardiac end points, and/or improved survival with coronary artery bypass surgery), and apparently healthy individuals. From this review, we conclude that silent ischemia induced by exercise testing in apparently healthy men is not as predictive of a poor outcome as once thought. Also, the use of the exercise test for screening is even more misleading than previously appreciated because of the higher rate of false positive results. Review of the 24 available studies of exercise testing in post-MI patients demonstrates that clinical judgment can be used to identify the high-risk patients, and that ST-segment shifts are not as predictive of high risk as an abnormal systolic blood pressure response or a poor exercise capacity. In patients with stable coronary heart disease, studies considering angiographic findings, cardiac events, and the differential outcome of coronary artery bypass surgery as compared with medical therapy have shown the exercise test to have prognostic power. From this perspective, it is obvious that there is much information supporting the use of exercise testing as the first noninvasive step after the history, physical examination, and resting electrocardiogram in the prognostic evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease. It accomplishes both purposes of prognostic testing: to provide information regarding the patient's status, and to help make recommendations for optimal management. The exercise test results help us make reasonable decisions for selection of patients who should undergo coronary angiography-including quality-of-life issues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89052594\r", 
  ".W": "Anatomically, the upper airway consists of the pharynx and nasal cavities. However, functionally, the larynx and trachea may be included, and the oral cavity provides an alternate entrance to the respiratory passages. The nose is a pyramidal structure composed of bone and cartilage attached to the facial skeleton, and is divided by a midline septum into the two nasal cavities. The nose functions as a heater and humidifier of inspired gas, a voice resonator, and houses the olfactory receptors. The paranasal sinuses drain into the nasal cavities. An endotracheal tube may be passed through the nose into the trachea when necessary to protect the airway and achieve positive-pressure ventilation. The mouth opens posteriorly into the oropharynx and forms the entrance to the digestive tract as well as an alternate pathway for respiration. It is also involved in phonation. Orotracheal intubation can be used as an alternative to nasal intubation to achieve airway protection and ventilation when necessary; however, variations in upper airway anatomy may make this technique difficult. In supine unconscious persons, backward movement of the tongue and lower jaw may cause airway obstruction. The pharynx is a U-shaped fibromuscular tube extending from the base of the skull to the cricoid cartilage at the entrance to the esophagus. Anteriorly it opens into the nasal cavity, the mouth, and the larynx, which divide it into the naso-, oro-, and laryngopharynx, respectively. The pharynx thus forms a common aerodigestive tract and is intimately involved with the act of swallowing. The larynx consists of a framework of cartilages and fibroelastic membranes covered by a sheet of muscles and lined with mucous membrane. It evolved as a protective valve mechanism at the upper end of the lower airway necessitated by an unusual crossover between the airway and alimentary canal. It functions as an open valve in respiration, a partially closed valve in phonation, and as a closed valve protecting against aspiration during swallowing. The larynx extends from its oblique entrance formed by the aryepiglottic folds, the tip of the epiglottis, and the posterior commissure to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage and bulges posteriorly into the laryngopharynx. The trachea extends from the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage to the carina where it divides into the mainstem bronchi. It is formed by U-shaped cartilaginous rings anteriorly and is closed posteriorly by the trachealis muscle. A properly placed endotracheal tube should have its tip at about midtracheal level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Factors considered were family background, emotional adjustment, interpersonal adjustment, vocational adjustment, financial status, adjustment to seizures, and medicine and medical management. The published studies highlighted a number of issues and sometimes rendered varying and contradictory conclusions. In general, epilepsy fosters certain reactions in family members. If negative, these reactions may be detrimental to the person with epilepsy. The association between specific emotional adjustment factors and epilepsy is not conclusive. Studies have been published which support as well as refute this association. Studies indicate that persons with epilepsy experience lower rates of marriage and more sexual difficulties than do nonepileptic persons. Studies report greater unemployment and underemployment in epileptic persons than in the population at large. Studies suggest that some persons with epilepsy manifest an attitude of nonacceptance of self. Some are reluctant to disclose their disability to others. The studies also indicate the presence of a discriminatory attitude by some nonepileptic persons toward epileptic persons. Several factors are associated with successful medical management of epilepsy. The emphasis in research studies with regard to psychosocial aspects of epilepsy focuses predominantly on individual deficiencies rather than on strengths and abilities.\r"

  ".W": "Resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is present in the majority of patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and in approximately 25% of nonobese individuals with normal oral glucose tolerance. In these conditions, deterioration of glucose tolerance can only be prevented if the beta-cell is able to increase its insulin secretory response and maintain a state of chronic hyperinsulinemia. When this goal cannot be achieved, gross decompensation of glucose homeostasis occurs. The relationship between insulin resistance, plasma insulin level, and glucose intolerance is mediated to a significant degree by changes in ambient plasma free-fatty acid (FFA) concentration. Patients with NIDDM are also resistant to insulin suppression of plasma FFA concentration, but plasma FFA concentrations can be reduced by relatively small increments in insulin concentration. Consequently, elevations of circulating plasma FFA concentration can be prevented if large amounts of insulin can be secreted. If hyperinsulinemia cannot be maintained, plasma FFA concentration will not be suppressed normally, and the resulting increase in plasma FFA concentration will lead to increased hepatic glucose production. Because these events take place in individuals who are quite resistant to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, it is apparent that even small increases in hepatic glucose production are likely to lead to significant fasting hyperglycemia under these conditions. Although hyperinsulinemia may prevent frank decompensation of glucose homeostasis in insulin-resistant individuals, this compensatory response of the endocrine pancreas is not without its price. Patients with hypertension, treated or untreated, are insulin resistant, hyperglycemic, and hyperinsulinemic. In addition, a direct relationship between plasma insulin concentration and blood pressure has been noted. Hypertension can also be produced in normal rats when they are fed a fructose-enriched diet, an intervention that also leads to the development of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. The development of hypertension in normal rats by an experimental manipulation known to induce insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia provides further support for the view that the relationship between the three variables may be a causal one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89052954\r", 
  ".W": "Glucose counterregulation is the sum of processes that protect against development of hypoglycemia and that restore euglycemia if hypoglycemia should occur. In order of importance, the key counterregulatory factors are glucagon, epinephrine, growth hormone, cortisol, and hepatic autoregulation. These act primarily by increasing hepatic glucose output, initially via breakdown of glycogen and later by gluconeogenesis. In people without diabetes and in people with type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes, suppression of endogenous insulin secretion during hypoglycemia is also important in permitting full expression of the effects of counterregulation. People with diabetes are more prone to develop hypoglycemia for various reasons (e.g., insulin overdose, skipped meals, and intensive exercise); one that has recently been identified is impaired glucose counterregulation: patients with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes (and to a lesser extent, patients with type II diabetes) lose the glucagon response to hypoglycemia; subsequent development of autonomic neuropathy with concomitant loss of the epinephrine response leads to almost complete paralysis of counterregulation and loss of recognition of hypoglycemia. To make matters worse, an episode of hypoglycemia that causes activation of counterregulation can lead to rebound hyperglycemia (Somogyi phenomenon); if this is improperly treated, brittle diabetes may follow. Thus, abnormalities in glucose counterregulation may predispose to severe hypoglycemia and prevent achievement of optimal glycemic control in patients with diabetes.\r"

  ".U": "89052955\r", 
  ".W": "Treatment of male sand rats kept on a balanced laboratory chow diet ad libitum with beta,beta'-tetramethyl-substituted hexadecanedioic acid (MEDICA 16) resulted in a hypolipidemic effect accompanied by an extensive reduction in adiposity, with a concomitant hypoglycemic-hypoinsulinemic effect. The overall effect was sustained as long as the drug was administered. The hypolipidemic effect of MEDICA 16 consisted of a 70 and 40% decrease in plasma triacylglycerols and cholesterol, respectively, and resulted from inhibition of liver lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis. Adipose reduction by MEDICA 16 treatment or calorie restriction consisted of a 75-90% decrease in the perirenal, omental, epididymal, and subcutaneous fat, with a 50% decrease in liver neutral lipids. The reduction in adiposity was accounted for by a respective decrease in the lipid content of individual adipocytes, with a concomitant decrease in the number of adipocytes of selected adipose tissues. The decrease induced in adiposity by MEDICA 16 treatment could not be accounted for by anorectic or cathartic effects of the drug. The hypoglycemic-hypoinsulinemic effect of MEDICA 16 consisted of amelioration of the tolerance of glucose with normalization of plasma insulin. It was accompanied by an eightfold increase in the number of insulin receptors in epididymal adipocytes, which was, however, counteracted by a decrease in their affinity for insulin. The receptor and postreceptor effects exerted by MEDICA 16 were similar to those of calorie restriction. The overall effect of MEDICA 16 in sand rats may reflect the pharmacological potential of MEDICA compounds in pathological hyperlipidemic-obesity-diabetic syndromes.\r"

We investigated whether neoplastic islet tumors express multiple hormone-specific cellular phenotypes of the islets. By analyses of RNA transcripts and immunoreactive peptides in four human insulinomas and one glucagonoma, we found that the insulin, somatostatin, and glucagon genes were coexpressed in all tumors. The expression of the three hormone genes in a lymph node metastasis of a glucagonoma reduced the possibility that contamination of tumor tissue by normal islets occurred. These observations lend further support to the hypothesis of the multipotentiality of neoplastic islet cells for the expression of genes encoding several different islet hormones.\r"

ICCs were derived after collagenase digestion and culture of pancreases from 16 fetuses (mean gestational age 15.6 wk). The ICCs were cultured with or without GH or IGF-I for 7 or 31 days. Basal rates of insulin and glucagon production were not altered by GH during the first 17 days of culture, but the release of both hormones was increasingly augmented by GH during the last 2 wk of culture (131% increase in insulin and 85% in glucagon compared with controls). ICCs cultured for 7 days in the presence of GH secreted more insulin when incubated for 120 min in 20 mM than in 2 mM glucose (2.1-fold response, P less than .05), whereas ICCs maintained in basal medium did not respond to glucose. GH had no effect on DNA and insulin content or insulin biosynthesis. Exogenous IGF-I caused a 28% suppression of insulin release (P less than .05) between days 4 and 10 of culture but induced a 49% increase in the mean secretion rate during the last week (days 25-31, P less than .01). Glucagon release was not affected by exogenous IGF-I. In contrast to GH, exogenous IGF-I induced a twofold increase in the DNA content of the 7-day--cultured ICCs. However, insulin biosynthesis and release were markedly suppressed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial insulin responsiveness was determined in open-chest pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized dogs before and after endotoxin administration. Animals were instrumented to measure mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), heart rate (HR), and coronary blood flow. Myocardial glucose uptake and myocardial oxygen uptake (MVO2) were determined during a basal control period and after a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure over a wide range of insulin concentrations. The clamp was accomplished by intravenously infusing insulin (0-4000 mU/min) and 20% glucose in sufficient amounts to maintain arterial glucose concentrations within 5 mg/dl of the control value. In a separate series of experiments, myocardial insulin responsiveness was determined by use of a single dose of insulin (4000 mU/min). This was done to determine whether antecedent insulin infusions during the sequential clamp procedure would affect the responsiveness of the heart. In control experiments, myocardial glucose uptake increased without any changes in HR, MVO2, or MABP. Maximum myocardial glucose uptake occurred at an insulin infusion rate between 400 and 4000 mU/min. A single concentration of insulin resulted in similar increases in myocardial glucose uptake as with the sequential clamp protocol. Acute endotoxin shock was induced by bolus injection of 1 mg/kg Salmonella typhimurium endotoxin (Difco Labs, Detroit, MI). One hour after administration of endotoxin, basal myocardial glucose uptake was decreased compared with the control animals. After 1 h of endotoxin shock, the heart was refractory to all concentrations of insulin, suggesting the site for altered insulin response was being mediated by a postreceptor mechanism.\r"

Two days after implantation of pumps, plasma insulin levels were twice normal levels and remained elevated (1.4-2.5 times normal) throughout the remainder of the study. Plasma glucose levels and granulation tissue polyol levels were normalized within 2 days after initiation of insulin treatment. Plasma IGF-I levels were significantly increased (2 times) by 2 days, but were not normalized until 7 days. In contrast, 125I-albumin permeation normalized at a much slower relatively linear rate and was still not completely normal after 14 days of insulin treatment. In view of 1) previous studies demonstrating that diabetes-induced increases in 125I-albumin permeation in this tissue are linked to increased metabolism of glucose to sorbitol and 2) the rapid normalization of tissue polyol levels in this study, the relatively linear rate of normalization of vascular permeability over 14 days in these studies suggests that impaired vascular barrier functional integrity in this model is mediated by structural and/or functional vascular alterations associated with sustained increased polyol metabolism rather than by increased polyol levels per se and/or by readily reversible functional and metabolic alterations associated with acute increases in polyol metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recently, we have shown that there is a directed microvascular circulation in the rat islet with a cellular order of perfusion of beta----alpha----delta. The direction of microvascular perfusion of cells within the dog islet has been controversial. Anterograde (arterial) perfusion and retrograde (reversed or venous) perfusion of a segment of isolated dog pancreas with potent insulin antibodies yielded results similar to those found in the rat pancreas (anterograde, 158 +/- 44% increase in glucagon and 65 +/- 20% increase in somatostatin; retrograde, no change in glucagon or somatostatin). Anterograde infusion of glucagon antibody (no change in insulin, -33.5 +/- 3% decrease in somatostatin) or somatostatin antibody (no change in insulin or glucagon) also yielded the same results as in the rat pancreas. Anterograde infusion of 500 pg/ml glucagon caused a larger increase in insulin secretion (245 +/- 10%) than retrograde infusion (45 +/- 4%), whereas somatostatin was stimulated more retrogradely (339 +/- 17%) than anterogradely (121 +/- 9%). Anterograde infusion of somatostatin produced a larger decrease in insulin and glucagon than did retrograde perfusion (P less than .0001 for both comparisons). The retrograde infusion of 0.3 mU/ml insulin caused a decrease in glucagon but was without effect anterogradely. The results from the infusion of exogenous hormones suggest that the sensitivity of the alpha-, beta-, and delta-cells to insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin is determined by the beta----alpha----delta order of perfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When the thin sections of islets from the NOD male mice, which received silica for the preservation of islets and subsequently cyclophosphamide, were examined under the electron microscope, clusters of endogenous retrovirus-like particles (type A) were frequently found in the beta-cells. In contrast, retrovirus-like particles were rarely found in the beta-cells from NOD male mice that received only silica. Other endocrine cells, including alpha-, delta-, pancreatic polypeptide-producing, and exocrine acinar cells, did not contain such viruslike particles. These viruslike particles were also not found in spleen, liver, or kidney in either cyclophosphamide-treated or untreated NOD male mice. There was a clear correlation between the presence of retrovirus-like particles in the beta-cells and insulitis lesions in the cyclophosphamide-treated mice. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the beta-cell-specific expression of endogenous retrovirus (like particles) is associated with the development of insulitis and diabetes in NOD mice.\r"

Although the mechanism for the increase in VEB with advancing age is uncertain, possibilities include latent coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy or dilatation, elevated plasma catecholamines, and a relative prolongation of the QT interval. Because the age-related increase in VEB does not appear to increase cardiac mortality in older subjects without demonstrable heart disease, and given the significant likelihood of adverse effects from antiarrhythmic drugs in their age group, these drugs should be reserved for elderly patients with organic heart disease and frequent or complex VEB.\r"
