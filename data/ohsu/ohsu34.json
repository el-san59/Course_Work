Data were grouped by food item and rated according to the criteria that had been developed specifically for evaluating the quality of selenium data. Ratings assigned to the data from each study yielded a Quality Index, indicating which data would be included in the calculation of the mean selenium value for each food item. The Quality Indexes for acceptable studies were summed to determine a Confidence Code, intended to indicate the relative degree of confidence the user can have in each mean selenium value. The selection of selenium core foods was based on their selenium concentration and frequency of consumption. Foods were ranked by multiplying selenium concentration by the amount consumed by the 36,255 individuals who provided 3-day dietary intake data in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 1977-78 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey. Mean, minimum, and maximum selenium values, Confidence Codes, ranks, and references have been compiled for 114 food items. The five most highly ranked food aggregates (beef, white bread, pork, chicken, and eggs) provided half of the selenium accounted for in the diets of the survey respondents.\r"

Although it is generally accepted that trace mineral requirements increase concomitantly with caloric and protein needs, little research has been conducted to document that assumption. Our survey was undertaken to assess current practice and identify research needs. One hundred ninety-six survey questionnaires were sent to burn units in North America. Forty percent (78) were returned. Ninety percent of respondents prescribe or recommend trace mineral supplements in their facilities. \"Higher risk\" was the single criterion most often mentioned as a basis for supplementation (54 [77%] of 70 respondents), with 49 of them indicating that they provide trace mineral supplements to patients receiving total parenteral nutrition support. Fifty-six respondents provided detailed information concerning trace mineral supplementation. Of that group, 88% prescribe zinc supplements, 75% prescribe iron supplements, and 26% prescribe chromium supplements. Thirteen percent supplement selenium. Less than 2% supplement molybdenum or vanadium and do so only when administering total parenteral nutrition. Many respondents expressed concern about the lack of guidelines for trace mineral supplementation in the burn patient, leading to the conclusion that further research in that area would benefit burn-injured patients and the health care providers who care for them.\r"

Nutrient intakes were calculated with the use of a food composition table, and the results were compared with those from the records that were kept by the boys' mothers. For each of the 68 Dutch boys, duplicate portions of the hot meal, taken at home, were collected and analyzed chemically. The results were compared with those from the records that were kept by the boys' mothers. The mean values for the absolute intakes of energy and nutrients for the boys from both Finland and The Netherlands as reported by the boys themselves or their mothers were generally higher (15% to 35%) than those measured by chemical analysis of a duplicate portion or calculated from a weighed portion as collected by a non-participating observer. However, the results for the relative proportions of energy generally showed closer agreement (range of difference, +11% to -15%). The authors found in this study that collection of duplicate portions of food resulted in lower (3% to 15%) recorded food intakes in comparison with measurements recorded for meals consumed on other days.\r"

The subjects were 12 or 14 years old in 1981. The height and weight measurements of the subjects were within normal ranges. The mean daily vitamin B-6 intake of the girls from food was 1.25 mg both years, as estimated by two nonsequential 24-hour food recalls. Approximately half of the girls reported consuming less than 0.02 mg vitamin B-6 per gm protein during both years. Almost half of the girls had coenzyme stimulation values indicative of marginal or deficient status. Coenzyme stimulation and dietary values of the race, age, and income groups were similar. Changes in the status grouping of the girls between the 2 years as reflected by the coenzyme stimulation measurement were associated with changes in their vitamin B-6 intakes in 70% of the cases. Vitamin B-6 inadequacy seems to be prevalent among both black and white adolescent girls.\r"

The women were not told that the central objective of the study was to examine the effects of the menstrual cycle on food cravings. The menstrual cycle was divided into four stages: menstrual flow; the first half of the cycle, excluding menstrual flow; the second half of the cycle, excluding the premenstrual phase; and 1 week premenstrual. Cravings for 32 foods were examined on a weekly basis under controlled environmental conditions. Foods tested were categorized according to common characteristics. The women exhibited a greater preference for chocolate foods during menstrual flow than during the other menstrual stages. Cravings for high-sugar foods, high-starch foods, or lower carbohydrate foods were not significantly affected by the stage of the menstrual cycle.\r"

  ".W": "Postpartum factors affecting the duration of lactation were identified for 250 women through a telephone survey. The survey examined the behaviors and attitudes of women who had chosen to nurse and who were still nursing at 2 weeks postpartum. Sixty percent of the mothers nursed their infants after delivery. However, by 10 weeks postpartum, only 34% of the babies were still breast fed. By self-report, the most significant factors associated with the maintenance of lactation at 10 weeks were related to perinatal hospital protocol, especially letting the infant suckle soon after birth. Other significant predictors of successful lactation outcome included early milk \"let down,\" little use of supplemental formula, the mother's expectation at parturition of an extended nursing period, her feeling well and being satisfied with her body weight, her previous successful experience with lactation, and her perception that she feeds her infant on demand. Few of the women who had stopped nursing after 2 weeks sought advice on breast feeding from anyone other than the pediatrician. Most coped with their nursing problems themselves. The data reinforce the importance of labor and delivery practices that support early maternal-infant contact. They also suggest the use of infant health indexes and weight and height percentile placement records rather than reliance solely on weight gain as the index of lactation adequacy. Further, they indicate the need for clinical intervention before 2 weeks postpartum.\r"

Discards over a 3-day period also were collected from a subsample of 50. The householder's estimate of amount, converted from measures to grams using food composition tables, was found to be 97% of the actual grams of food, as weighed in the laboratory. Households discarded an average of 1,587 gm ($2.88) food in a 7-day period on the basis of the 79% completed usable records. Major reasons were poor quality for fruits and vegetables; storage time for meat, fish, and poultry; non-use of leftovers for combination dishes; and plate waste for cereals and dairy products. Twenty-nine percent of the discarded food (by cost) was considered to be unsafe to eat by the householder. Aesthetic factors dominated decisions by the 18- to 25-year age group, but experiences related to food storage were the basis for decisions by half of the respondents more than 65 years old. Discards increased with number of members in the household and were influenced by age of children. Household income was not linearly related to amount of discard. As household refrigerator temperatures increased from 1.7 degrees C to 20 degrees C, the amount of discards also increased. Consumers generally lacked criteria for evaluating the safety of foods.\r"

Major topics related to nutrition assessment; physical, social, and psychological needs; diet-related diseases; and nutrition programs benefiting the elderly. Fifty-one percent of the CUPs and 23% of the internship programs trained students 3 weeks or more in a geriatric setting, while 45% and 72%, respectively, trained 2 weeks or less. Nursing homes were the primary site of training. The most frequently required activities included identifying specific needs of the elderly in relation to other adults, completing diet histories, and presenting nutrition education to a geriatric population. The question remains as to whether the quantity and type of geriatric experiences currently included are sufficient to keep pace with the increasingly aging population.\r"

Test groups (no. = 37) participating in the intervention were compared with a no-treatment control group (no. = 29) at four sites in northern California. The program employs a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and affective techniques adapted to make successive small modifications in diet, exercise, communication, and affect that are sustainable. Very-low-calorie or restrictive diets are avoided in the program. Parents are instructed on strategies for supporting their adolescents' weight-loss efforts. Participation in the group application of the program was associated with significant improvement in relative weight, weight-related behavior, depression, and knowledge of weight management concepts at post-treatment and at 1-year follow-up. Self-esteem increased significantly regardless of condition. Change in relative weight for the test group was -9.9 +/- 14.9% (mean +/- standard deviation) and for the control group was -0.10 +/- 13.2%. At month 15 of the study period, weight change in the test group compared with the controls was -5.15 kg. For all subject variables examined in the test group, mean change in relative weight at 1-year follow-up was negative, suggesting that none of the characteristics examined contraindicate program participation among obese adolescents seeking care. Drop-out rate was 16%. The study suggests that the program produces significant long-term outcomes in obese adolescents and is transferable to a variety of settings.\r"

Radial BMC fell 2 to 3.4% per decade but vertebral trabecular BMC declined more rapidly at 12% per decade. Of the sex steroids measured the only statistically significant change occurred in free testosterone levels which decreased with age (r = -.57, P less than .0001). Free testosterone levels correlated significantly with trabecular vertebral BMC (r = .458, P less than .0002) but not with bone mineral measures at the predominantly cortical radial sites. However, by multiple regression analysis free testosterone did not add to the effect of age on vertebral BMC. There were no associations of total testosterone, estrone, or estradiol levels to bone mineral content at any of the three sites measured in these healthy men. Age-related declines in male gonadal function do not appear to be of primary importance in male age-related bone loss.\r"

Examples of such measures include the Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS) and Pfeiffer's Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). A third measure used in the assessment of organic cognitive impairment is the Face-Hand Test (FHT). This study, which was part of a large longitudinal investigation of SDAT, examined the performance of 43 subjects with SDAT and 57 healthy controls over 30 months. The subjects were assessed three times during this period. In addition to the brief measures (BDS, SPMSQ, and FHT) all subjects were rated on a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale based on a lengthy clinical interview. The data were analyzed by means of a series of univariate, repeated measures ANOVAs, and discriminant analysis. Results indicate: control scores did not change over time on any of the measures; when classified according to severity of SDAT, different patterns of performance emerged over time for each measure; and it is difficult to accurately predict progression of SDAT from the three scores.\r"

The bacteremia rate per 1000 hospital admissions increased sharply with increasing age. The ecology and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of the bacterial isolates were strongly influenced by community v hospital acquisition, but not by age. Urosepsis was significantly more likely to be the underlying source of hospital-acquired bacteremia in patients 70 years or older (P less than 0.01). Total bacteremia-related mortality did not increase with increasing age; in the group of patients aged 70 years or older with nonfatal/ultimately fatal underlying diseases (NF/UFUD), however, mortality was 9.1% compared to 2.9% in the younger age group (P less than 0.001). Significantly increased bacteremia-related mortality was also noted in the older patients with NF/UFUD admitted from nursing homes (P less than 0.05) and those not treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent within 24 hours (P less than 0.01). Overall, the older patients with hospital-acquired bacteremia, neutropenia-associated infection, those bacteremic from a nonurinary source of infection, and those treated with multiple-drug regimens had higher mortality (P less than 0.05). Gram-negative bacteremia is much more common in patients 70 years of age or older and compared with younger patients mortality appears to be significantly increased for the important subgroup of older patients with nonfatal or ultimately fatal underlying diseases.\r"

Physician rating of memory, employing the Inventory of Psychic and Somatic Complaints in the Elderly (IPSC-E), indicated statistically significant improvement of memory function in DEM treated subjects (N = 22) v those on placebo (N = 19), (F = 3.34; df = 1,39; P less than .04). In contrast, structured testing of recent memory using digit symbol substitution and Zahlenverbindungs test (ZVT) showed improvement in both groups (P less than .001) with no significant intergroup differences (P less than .10).

Neuroleptics can lead to neutropenia by toxic or immunologic mechanisms, and it is impossible to predict which patients will sustain this potentially life-threatening reaction. Fever and infection may be the only clue to this blood dyscrasias. The diagnosis of drug-induced neutropenia is largely one of exclusion coupled with the observation of increasing neutrophil counts after cessation of the drug.\r"

With the recent development of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), many older patients can now be treated for renal calculi. The Department of Urology at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics has performed 107 ESWL treatments on a total of 96 patients over 70 years of age. This represents over 12% of all patients treated at our institution. No deaths related to ESWL treatment have occurred in this group, nor has increased morbidity been observed in comparison to all patients treated. In spite of the increased age and associated medical problems of this patient population, ESWL offers a safe and effective means of treating upper tract urinary calculi in the geriatric age group.\r"

Positively-accelerated power functions described the relationship between the response latencies of groups of older (50 to 60 years and 65 to 75 years) and younger adults (20 to 25 years) with extreme precision (r2 = .99). The exponent of the best-fitting power function increased with the age of the older group. The form of the relationship is allometric, and is consistent with a model (Botwinick, 1984) in which response latency increases exponentially with task difficulty. The present findings suggest that this model holds across a wide variety of information-processing tasks and over a very broad range of latencies.\r"

This raises new research design issues, one of which is the estimation of appropriate sample sizes for longitudinal studies when only cross-sectional data are presently available. Formulae for estimating change parameters from cross-sectional data are presented in this article. Based on age-related changes in cross-sectional norms for the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), the sample sizes required for controlled intervention studies of 1 to 3 years duration are very large. If cognitive decline within individuals is not as great as the decline evident in cross-sectional norms, the required sample sizes will be even larger.\r"

Heart rate, although relatively high at the upper age level, was unrelated to sleep measures. For the most part, underarousal rather than hyperarousal characterized older sleepers. Women's body temperature declined significantly with age. Vasoconstrictions, which were more frequent in young adults, showed some association with better sleep. The earlier the overnight temperature nadir, the more wakefulness after sleep onset. Together with other studies, this suggests that an age-related phase advance in the temperature rhythm disrupts sleep. These results are at odds with the view that sympathetic hyperactivity associated with elevated plasma norepinephrine causes age-related sleep disturbance.\r"

Diminished body mass improved the underfed rats' abilities to hang suspended from a wire, to maintain balance on a narrow beam, and to descend from a wire mesh pole in a coordinated fashion. Underfed rats, however, lost these abilities at the same rate as did control rats. Undernutrition did not affect the startle response to acoustic stimulation, nor did it influence auditory or visual lead stimulus inhibition of the startle response. Both groups of animals showed progressive, age-related losses of sensory-motor function which proceeded at the same rate in each group. Life-prolonging undernutrition did not appear to retard aging of these simple, reflexive behaviors.\r"

As predicted, both old and young persons' identification response times for those drawings increased with decreases in contour completeness, indicating increased elaborative processing (Kunen et al., 1979). Moreover, a moderate decrease in contour completeness was associated with increased recall of the drawings for both age groups, although older persons identified the drawings more slowly and recalled fewer drawings than did younger persons. These findings complement those of Park et al. (1986) and demonstrate that older persons engage in active cognitive elaboration of pictorial stimuli when those stimuli are presented in such a way as to encourage elaboration.\r"

Retirement preparation was found to maintain both the desirability and expectancy of internal control and positive retirement attitudes among the worker participants relative to controls. Retirees did not differ on measures of adjustment; those with retirement preparation, however, evidenced higher externality than those without.

Regardless of Ta, blood glucose levels were higher in older than younger women during the first hour of the exposures (p less than .05). Free fatty acid levels in older women were double those of others (p less than .001). Epinephrine levels were 25% higher in men than women (p less than .05). Cortisol levels were 30% higher in younger than older adults, regardless of sex (p less than .01). All measurements, and norepinephrine, were elevated in all groups during the 10 degrees C exposure. Rapid increases in metabolism in older women during cold exposure may have been facilitated by substrate availability. This advantage may have resulted from greater utilization of cortisol and epinephrine, increased catecholamine sensitivity, or hormonal changes consequent to menopause.\r"

Under hyperoxic conditions, the ventilatory response to progressive hypercapnia was not significantly different between age groups but, under hypoxic conditions, the response to hypercapnia was lower in the elderly group. The interaction of hypercapnic and hypoxic stimuli was greater among young persons as indicated by a higher ratio of the hypercapnic response slopes (hypoxic/hyperoxic); 1.48 +/- 0.19 versus 0.98 +/- 0.11, p less than .05. The ventilatory response to hypoxia at the lower CO2 level was significantly greater among elderly than among young adults but not significantly different between age groups at the higher CO2 level. The ratio of hypoxic response slopes (high PCO2/lower PCO2) was 1.56 +/- 0.17 among elderly participants and 3.14 +/- 0.63 among young participants (p less than .05).

Norepinephrine-induced contractions in the senescent beagle arteries treated with propranolol were greater than those in the young beagle arteries and were inhibited by prazosin but not by yohimbine. Relaxant responses to isoproterenol were less in the arteries from old beagles than in the young beagle arteries. The magnitude of relaxations induced by norepinephrine and epinephrine was greatest in small arteries from old beagles, followed by medium and large arteries, in that order. Transmural electrical stimulation tended to produce a contraction in the old beagle arteries and a relaxation in the strips from young beagles. It appears that alpha 1 adrenoceptor function increases with advancing age in beagle coronary arteries of large and medium sizes, and beta receptor function declines. Vasoconstriction mediated by alpha 1 receptors is postulated to be related inversely to the distance from the coronary orifice in senescent beagles, and vice versa with vasodilatation mediated by beta receptors.\r"

The analysis showed that suicide continues to be a serious problem in later life especially among the \"oldest-old\" (those aged 85 and over) and among nonwhite males. It also showed important differences in cohort risks that may strongly affect future suicide risks among elderly adults.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody (3C-7) specific for a determinant localized on the carboxy-terminus of the BSA molecule (P505-582) has been shown to cause suppression of the multispecific BSA antibody response if given i.v. before immunization. The fine binding specificity and the isotype subclass are not responsible for the suppression generated. Administration of 3C-7 i.v. results in the generation of a suppressor T cell that, when transferred into reconstituted irradiated mice, results in a diminished anti-BSA response. Suppression can be eliminated by panning T cells on idiotype (3C-7) coated plates, but not by panning on BSA, polyclonal anti-BSA antibodies, or MOPC 21. The action of the cell is antigen (BSA) specific. Idiotype-binding T cells reconstitute suppression and appear to be Lyt-1-2+. These observations demonstrate that a limited set of monoclonal antibodies directed against a single determinant on a protein molecule have the capacity to regulate the immune response to a multiplicity of determinants present on the same protein. These data support the concept of antibody-induced regulation by the induction of suppressor cells through idiotype recognition.\r"

  ".W": "Mice infected with the parasite Mesocestoides corti produce a vigorous antibody response that is restricted to the IgM and IgG1 heavy chain classes. The isotypic restriction observed is apparently associated with active infection and is not a unique characteristic of responses to M. corti antigens. Thus, animals immunized with intact but nonviable parasites respond with the production of a variety of antibody isotypes in addition to IgM and IgG1. To delineate immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in the isotypic restriction of antibody responses to M. corti, an in vitro lymphocyte suspension culture was established. The data indicate that there are two cell subsets in the spleens of infected mice that contribute to an overall suppression of the in vitro antibody response. Thus, both Lyt-2+ cells and G-10-adherent cells must be removed to maximize antibody production. However, the anti-parasite response obtained in vitro after depletion of Lyt-2+ cells and G-10-adherent cells is restricted to the IgM and IgG1 isotypes as observed in vivo, indicating that suppression is not actively involved in the IgM, IgG1 dominance of the response. The cellular regulation associated with this restriction was then studied by using isolated helper T cells derived from parasite-infected animals to stimulate B cells from uninfected animals. The antibody produced was again restricted to IgM and IgG1, indicating that the helper T cells were regulating the preferential expression of the IgM and IgG1 antibody classes.\r"

In contrast, sera devoid of antibodies to KBG-R had no inhibitory capacity. In a radioallergosorbent test, it was demonstrated that Mab 27 could inhibit the binding of human IgE antibodies to Ag 27 to the extent of 52%.

  ".U": "87139208\r", 
  ".W": "Monocyte emigration into areas of inflammation is initiated by monocyte adherence to the microvascular endothelium which may be induced by the local production of chemotactic factors at the inflammatory site. However, it is not clear whether such stimuli act on the monocyte and/or the endothelial cell to promote this effect. Accordingly, the effect of the chemotactic peptides C5a des arg and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) on human monocyte adherence to human microvascular endothelial cell monolayers was investigated in vitro. Monocytes (92 to 98% pure) were isolated by discontinuous plasma-Percoll density gradients and cell elutriation, methods designed to minimize monocyte exposure to endotoxin. Mean spontaneous (unstimulated) adherence of 111Indium-tropolonate-radiolabeled monocytes to microvascular endothelial cell monolayers was 19.7% +/- 1.3. Monocyte adherence to microvascular endothelial cell monolayers was stimulated in a dose-response fashion in the presence of C5a des arg or FMLP to a maximum mean adherence of 47.2% +/- 2.9 or 43.8% +/- 2.2, respectively. C5a des arg or FMLP stimulated monocytes to adhere to monolayers of human vascular smooth muscle cells, human dermal fibroblasts, or serum-coated plastic wells in a comparable fashion as to endothelial cells. The simultaneous presence of both chemotactic peptides C5a des arg and FMLP in the assay system stimulated monocyte adherence to the same degree as either stimulus alone. This finding suggested that those monocytes stimulated to adhere by C5a des arg were the same subpopulation responding to FMLP. Spontaneous monocyte adherence (in the absence of chemotactic peptides) to both endothelial cell monolayers and serum-coated plastic wells was reduced in the presence of plasma, but chemotactic peptides induced a significant, albeit reduced, adhesion of monocytes in this circumstance. The pretreatment of monocytes with either C5a des arg or FMLP prior to the adherence assay induced stimulus-specific desensitization of monocyte adherence. Neither a desensitization nor stimulated monocyte adherence occurred when endothelial cell monolayers or serum-coated plastic wells were pretreated with either of the chemotactic peptides. The fixation of endothelial cell monolayers prior to the adherence assay did not alter the degree of spontaneous, C5a des arg-stimulated, or FMLP-stimulated monocyte adherence. These data suggest that the stimulated adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells by C5a des arg or FMLP represents primarily an effect of these chemotactic peptides on the monocyte.\r"

The effect of therapeutic concentrations of methylxanthines on human neutrophil functions stimulated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) was examined. Preincubation of cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils with 10(-5) M to 3 X 10(-3) M methylxanthine resulted in a biphasic, concentration-dependent effect on neutrophil aggregation, lysosomal enzyme release, and superoxide anion formation. At 10(-5) to 10(-4) M, theophylline and aminophylline potentiated neutrophil aggregation, lysosomal enzyme release (30 to 50%, p less than 0.005), and superoxide anion formation (30 to 60%, p less than 0.005). 1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine at these same concentrations potentiated only neutrophil aggregation and lysosomal enzyme release (30 to 40%, p less than 0.005). The three methylxanthines inhibited each response up to 90% at concentrations greater than 10(-4) M. 8-Phenyltheophylline, which does not inhibit phosphodiesterase activity, produced only potentiation. Preincubation of neutrophils with adenosine deaminase mimicked the methylxanthine potentiation, whereas addition of adenosine (3 X 10(-8) to 3 X 10(-7) M) reversed the methylxanthine-induced potentiation in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that therapeutic concentrations of methylxanthines may potentiate neutrophil activation in vivo by competing with circulating adenosine for neutrophil adenosine receptors.\r"

These families were characterized by classical HLA serology, MLC, and DP typing. In each family, a pair of \"HLA-identical\" siblings demonstrated a small proliferative response in bidirectional MLC. Southern blotting analysis performed with cDNA probes for DQ alpha, DP alpha, and DP beta identified DP genomic differences in each case. Hybridization of Bgl II-digested genomic DNA with a DP alpha cDNA probe revealed three prominent polymorphic fragments (7.7, 5.8, and 3.7 kb), which discriminated between presumptive identical siblings and indicated crossover events within HLA. Similarly, hybridization of SstI-digested genomic DNA with a DP beta cDNA probe, although resulting in a more complex pattern, identified DP genomic disparity between the presumed HLA identical siblings. Hybridization of SstI-digested DNA from two families with evidence of DP recombination was performed by using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the newly described HLA class II gene DO beta. Two major polymorphic fragments, at 6.2 and 3.3 kb, segregated in these families and localized the crossovers flanking the DO beta gene between the DQ and DP loci. The contribution of the antigenic differences marked by these HLA DP and DO DNA polymorphisms to allorecognition in MLR and in graft-vs-host disease are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Activated macrophages that were stabilized with either formalin or glutaraldehyde absorbed two polypeptides (Mr 100,000 and 60,000) from detergent extracts of all of the tumor cell lines tested, but not from detergent extracts of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. A major polypeptide (Mr 95,000) was retained from spent culture media of tumor cell lines. Polypeptides with molecular sizes of 100,000 and 60,000 daltons were also adsorbed by activated macrophages from detergent extracts of chicken embryo cell membranes, suggesting an oncofetal nature for these proteins. The 100,000 dalton polypeptide, but not the 60,000 dalton component, was found to be available to lactoperoxidase-catalyzed cell surface iodination. Polypeptides with identical molecular sizes could be adsorbed to immobilized galactopyranoside, indicating that they are vertebrate lectins. Activated macrophages and affinity adsorbents prepared by the covalent coupling of galactopyranoside to agarose also bind the plant lectin isolectin B4 prepared from the seeds of Griffonia simplicifolia. On the basis of these findings, we put forth the hypothesis that macromolecules of the same specificity, that is affinity to galactopyranosyl residues, must show homologies in their binding sites. We have predicted therefore that antisera prepared against this plant lectin should cross-react with galactopyranosyl-binding vertebrate lectins present on the surface of tumor cells. In this communication, we also report the generation of hybridomas that produce antibodies reactive with both the plant and vertebrate lectins. Inhibition experiments that make use of various mono- and disaccharides suggest that the specificities of these antibodies are for determinants intimately associated with the galactosyl binding site on the lectin molecule. Two of the antibodies were found to have moderate selectivity for tumor cells when tested in an immunohistochemical procedure that made use of fresh-frozen or paraffin-embedded sections of human biopsy material. These two antibodies on immunoblots of tumor cell membrane extracts reacted with a polypeptide with an apparent molecular size of 100,000 daltons.\r"

Mature elastic fibers were labeled only in their peripheral microfibrils (elastofibrils) and the center core of elastin was nonreactive. Basal lamina itself was not decorated with NKH-1 even at the immunoelectron microscopic level. Skin appendages such as eccrine and apocrine glands, arrector pili muscle, hair follicle, and sebaceous gland were surrounded with NKH-1-positive substances. This substance was in linear fashion closely associated with the basal lamina but deposited linearly outside of it. Species specificity tests were performed only in nonprimates: mouse and guinea pig skins were nonreactive with NKH-1. NKH-1 seems to recognize a new substance in the subbasal lamina region (subbasal lamina proteins) which crossreact with elastic fiber microfibrils.\r"

BALB/c mice were rendered phototoxic by i.p. injection of hematoporphyrin derivative, followed by exposure to 13.6 kJ/m2 of 400-410 nm radiation. The phototoxic response was quantified by measurement of ear thickness immediately before the irradiation, and at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 h after. At these time-points, determinations of serum histamine and plasma leukotriene C4 levels and histologic examination of the ears were undertaken. Mice injected i.p. with buffered saline and subsequently irradiated served as controls. In mice exposed to HPD and radiation, a maximal peak increased ear-thickness of 125.7 +/- 14.4% (mean +/- SEM) was noted at 2 h; this was associated with a net increased serum histamine of over 120% and histologic evidence of mast cell degranulation. In addition, moderate increases in plasma levels of leukotriene C4 were observed at 0 h and 1.5 h in the HPD- and irradiation-treated animals. These data provide direct evidence for the participation of mast cells in the early phase of HPD-induced phototoxicity.\r"

In this cell line, the final assembly of the envelope does not occur spontaneously but must be induced using a calcium ionophore. Five potential precursor proteins with molecular weights of 140K, 90K, 61K, 53K, and 36K, respectively, could be detected in the extracts of envelope competent and noncompetent cells. The 61 kD and the 36 kD precursors were specifically decorated in immunoblots when using an antiserum directed against the purified cornified envelope of SV-K14 cells. The 140 kD protein was identified as involucrin by means of a commercial anti-involucrin antibody. Part of the 61 kD protein was found to be inserted into the plasma membrane after the cells gained envelope competence. The set of precursor proteins used by SV-K14 cells differed markedly from those described in the literature for epidermal cells in vivo and for normal human keratinocytes in vitro. Furthermore, cyanogen bromide cleavage of purified envelopes from transformed and normal keratinocytes revealed a completely different peptide pattern. This indicates that the exact molecular composition of the cornified envelope may not be strictly determined and may vary according to the availability of potential substrate proteins at the very moment when the cross-linking enzyme, the plasma membrane associated transglutaminase, becomes functional.\r"

Both antibodies react strongly with the granular cell layer consistent with the distribution of keratohyalin and show a more diffuse reaction with the stratum corneum in normal skin biopsies. Reaction in cultured human keratinocytes is limited to immunofluorescent granules in flattened, well-differentiated cells in confluent cultures, in which we have previously demonstrated keratohyalin. On immunoblots AKH1 reacts with filaggrin (37 kD) and profilaggrin (400 kD), while AKH2 primarily stains bands of 150 and 300 kD. The AKH2 antigens were identified in the cationic protein fraction used for immunization and were purified by gel permeation and high-performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid composition of these proteins differs only slightly from filaggrin. Immunohistochemical staining patterns of the two antibodies are very similar in the genetic disorders of keratinization tested, except for ichthyosis vulgaris, and reflect the presence and distribution of keratohyalin. In ichthyosis vulgaris, AKH1 staining is weak, consistent with the morphology and with biochemical absence of profilaggrin/filaggrin; however, AKH2 staining is positive, although weaker than normal, suggesting the presence of the AKH2 antigens even when keratohyalin is absent or abnormal. Antibodies AKH1 and AKH2 may be useful as differentiation markers for keratinization in tissues and for cells in culture. Antibody AKH1 can be used specifically for detection of profilaggrin/filaggrin in tissues, cultured keratinocytes, and extracts.\r"

Labeled cells were scored either as singlets or doublets (adjacent labeled cells). The percent labeled cells and percent labeled cells as doublets were determined. The estimated labeling index (the proportion of cells labeled by a single exposure to [3H]Thd) of the epidermal basal layer decreased as a function of age. The slope of the semilog plot of the percent labeled cells as doublets as a function of electron dose indicates that the Do value decreases with increasing age. The results show, however, that the greatest difference in sensitivity occurs between 2-day (neonatal) and 28-day (pubescent) animals and again between 420-day (adult) and 728-day (senescent) animals.\r"

  ".W": "Two sibs and one unrelated infant were born prematurely with taut, shiny, restrictive skin that was abnormal in structure, organization, biochemistry, and state of differentiation. Prominent abnormalities in all regions of the skin were recognized by light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and biochemistry. The epidermis was hyperplastic, hyperkeratotic, and parakeratotic. Keratohyaline granules were abnormal in structure, but the keratohyalin-derived protein filaggrin was apparently normal in quantity and biochemistry. The epidermal cells contained less than the expected quantity of high-molecular-weight, differentiation-specific keratins and the tissue stained with antikeratin antibodies in an aberrant pattern. Additional 48 and 56 kD keratin polypeptides, indicative of a hyperproliferative state, were expressed. The dermal-epidermal junction was remarkably flat and the dermis was thinner than normal. The connective tissue appeared stretched and was oriented like tendon rather than dermis. Collagen fiber bundles and fibrils were smaller in diameter than normal. The nails were normal but other epidermal appendages such as the pilosebaceous structures and the eccrine sweat glands were underdeveloped, suggesting that morphogenesis of these structures was arrested at an early stage in utero. The subcutaneous fat was at least twice the thickness of the dermis. The skin abnormalities appeared to be the cause of the flexion contractions, characteristic facies, and inability to survive because of restricted respiratory movements. The structural and biochemical abnormalities in the skin of affected infants may serve as markers for prenatal and postnatal diagnosis of the disorder, and may provide insight into the basic mechanism of the disease.\r"

Nude rats and thymus-grafted nude rats were susceptible to infection with T. mentagrophytes but only thymus-grafted nude rats cleared the dermatophytosis. Clearance of the fungal infection took twice as long (approximately 60 days) in thymus-grafted nude rats when compared with heterozygous euthymic (+/RNU) controls (approximately 35 days). Following clearance of the primary dermatophytosis, peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were adoptively transferred from either thymus-grafted or heterozygous rats to nude rats. Eight of 12 PEC-recipient nude rats acquired the capacity to resolve T. mentagrophytes-induced dermatophytosis (mean clearance time was approximately 40 days). All heterozygous (+/RNU) rats, thymus-grafted nude rats (4/4), and 8 of 12 PEC-recipient nude rats, which had cleared a primary dermatophytosis also expressed delayed-type hypersensitivity and elevated serum antibody titers to trichophytin antigen. These results demonstrate that immunity to T. mentagrophytes can be acquired in congenitally athymic nude rats following thymus grafting or injection of PEC from syngeneic +/RNU rats; however, injection of PEC from trichophytin-sensitized +/RNU donor rats to nude recipient rats did not result in transfer of specific adoptive immunity to T. mentagrophytes. Interestingly, PEC transfer from non-sensitized +/RNU rats was comparable to thymus grafting in effecting clearance of T. mentagrophytes dermatophytosis. These results suggest that acquired immunity to T. mentagrophytes in the rat is T cell-dependent, and that the absence of functional T lymphocytes and not an epithelial defect results in chronic dermatophytosis in the nude rat.\r"

Formerly considered irreversible changes, we recently showed in hairless mice, post irradiation, that a band of normal connective tissue was laid down subepidermally. The present studies focused on 2 aspects of this repair: whether repair would occur if animals were protected by sunscreens after dermal damage was induced and irradiation continued; whether retinoic acid could enhance the repair process. To examine the first aspect, albino hairless mice were irradiated with Westinghouse FS 20 sunlamps thrice weekly for 30 weeks. Sunscreens of high sun-protection factors were applied after 10 and 20 weeks. Not only was further damage prevented, but the damage incurred before sunscreen application was repaired. This appeared as subepidermal reconstruction zones containing normal, mature collagen and a network of fine elastic fibers. The second aspect was examined by applying 0.05% retinoic acid, topically, to animals preirradiated for 10 weeks. In contrast to controls treated with vehicle, the reconstruction zone was significantly wider in retinoic acid-treated mice. The enhanced repair was dose-related.\r"

  ".W": "The stratum corneum lipids, responsible for the epidermal water barrier, consist principally of ceramides, cholesterol, cholesteryl sulfate, and free fatty acids. These lipids are arranged in multiple intercellular lamellae that provide an efficient water barrier because of the crystalline array of the straight and predominantly saturated lipid chains. Interlamellar linkages provided by lipids based on 30-carbon omega-hydroxyacids may be responsible for holding together the intercellular lamellae as well as for assembly of the lamellar granules of the granular cells. The normally ordered exfoliation of corneocytes as they arrive at the surface seems to require hydrolysis of the cholesteryl sulfate to free cholesterol. The sebaceous glands secrete continuously, producing sebum that consists predominantly of triglycerides, wax esters, and squalene. High rates of sebum production per sebocyte result in low levels of linoleate in the sebaceous esters, subjecting the follicular epithelium to essential fatty acid deficiency and the characteristic hyperkeratosis that results in comedo formation. Suppression of sebum production by drugs elevates sebum linoleate concentration and relieves follicular hyperkeratosis. Thus, sebum continues to be a prime suspect in the crime of acne. Low levels of sebaceous gland activity are not correlated with the occurrence of dry skin.\r"

There is, however, no absolute restriction as to age, sex, or race. Clinical variants include the papular, vesiculo-bullous, and hemorrhagic variety, as well as plaque, erythema multiforme-like, and insect bite (strophulus)-like types. Skin lesions appear only in certain exposed areas hours or a few days after intense sunshine, and are nearly always monomorphous in the same patient. The rash subsides spontaneously within several days without leaving scars. The histopathologic picture is characteristic and shows a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper and middle corium with subepidermal edema, vacuolization of basal cells, and spongiosis in the lower epidermis. The most important differential diagnoses are solar urticaria, photosensitive erythema multiforme, and lupus erythematosus. The action spectrum of PLE is under debate. Reproduction of skin lesions has been reported with UVB, UVA, and, rarely, visible light, with UVA probably being the most effective part of the spectrum. More important than treatment of PLE is prophylaxis. UVA- and UVB-effective sunscreens are of some help. Phototherapy and especially photochemotherapy (psoralen + UVA; PUVA) offer effective ways to decrease light sensitivity. Systemic treatment with chloroquine or beta-carotene has been disappointing.\r"

At concentrations of greater than 0.02%, both surfactants were cytotoxic, as was evident by decreased eosin exclusion, massive histamine and beta-glucuronidase-release, and absent migration of cells. At dilutions of less than 0.002% of both surfactants, viability of cells was normal, and small amounts of histamine and beta-glucuronidase were released at a dilution of 0.001%. The most striking finding was a dose-dependent chemotactic and chemokinetic response at dilutions from 10(-3) to 10(-8)%. These observations offer a possible explanation for the pathomechanisms of irritant dermatitis due to surfactants.\r"

Compared with uninfected mice and mice inoculated with heat-inactivated virus, litter sizes were reduced, and the incidence of abnormal fetuses was significantly increased among MCMV-infected animals. Scanning electron microscopy also revealed maldeveloped cranial regions characterized by an unclosed neural tube and severely underdeveloped head. Ectodermal abnormalities, including poxlike formations and ballooning cells, were observed in several embryos. Thus, early cytomegalovirus infection may not only result in fetal loss, but may also interfere with the process of morphogenesis.\r"

In a standardized assay of susceptibility to normal human serum, 27 (71%) strains were resistant, six (16%) had intermediate susceptibility, and five (13%) were serum sensitive. Major protein bands migrating at 100 kDa or 125 kDa on polyacrylamide gels were present in all of the 25 serum-resistant strains tested but in only four of seven serum-sensitive isolates of C. fetus from humans and animals (P = .007). The presence of these bands was associated with type A lipopolysaccharide. A low-passaged strain, 82-40, was serum resistant and contained the 100-kDa protein; however, a spontaneous mutant of this strain lacked this band and was serum sensitive. The 100-kDa and 125-kDa proteins of three strains of C. fetus were antigenically cross reactive or identical and were exposed on the surface of the C. fetus cell. Serum resistance is inherent to most C. fetus isolates from humans and is associated with the presence of cross-reactive surface proteins.\r"

The PMNLs were tested in Zigmond chambers with or without a gradient of 10(-7) M n-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (f-Met-Leu-Phe). Cellular movement was recorded on videotape by using a videocamera mounted on the microscope. The videotapes were analyzed by computer programs to calculate the speed and direction of each PMNL at 10-sec intervals. Average rates of chemokinesis were 19.6 microns/min without and 25.3 microns/min with f-Met-Leu-Phe. McCutcheon indices, which measure chemotaxis, were 0.01 without and 0.48 with f-Met-Leu-Phe. Similar values were observed in diabetic patients after fasting (average glucose, 217 mg/100 ml) and 2 hr after glucose challenge (average glucose, 309 mg/100 ml).

Serum concentrations of AmB, measured by bioassay, were used to determine various pharmacokinetic parameters of AmB. A one-compartment model of drug distribution was most consistent with the data. The volume of AmB distributed per kilogram of body weight was smaller and the elimination clearance more rapid than those previously reported for adults. Serum levels were approximately one-half those seen in adults given comparable doses. The mean concentrations of AmB after various doses were as follows: at 0.25 mg/kg, 0.08 microgram/ml; at 0.50 mg/kg, 0.20 microgram/ml; at 0.75 mg/kg, 0.42 microgram/ml; and at 1.0 mg/kg, 0.54 microgram/ml. Interpatient variability was, however, marked, especially among the premature infants. AmB pharmacokinetics are different in infants and children than in adults; these differences may have implications for determining optimal pediatric dosing regimens.\r"

Studies in 65 of these patients were performed prospectively. Both the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary gland were in the field of irradiation. The median radiation dose was estimated to be 5700 rad to the anterior pituitary gland and 5000 rad to the hypothalamus. We found evidence of endocrine deficiencies in 134 of the 166 patients observed. One hundred eleven patients showed evidence suggestive of hypothalamic lesions and 67 patients showed evidence of primary pituitary deficiency. Forty-eight of the 110 patients who received radiotherapy to the neck for treatment or prevention of lymph node metastasis showed evidence of primary hypothyroidism. The median dose to the thyroid area was 5000 rad. Adolescents younger than 15 years of age had a higher incidence of growth hormone deficiency soon after radiotherapy, but the older group showed adrenocortical and luteinizing hormone deficiency. These results indicate that endocrine deficiencies after radiotherapy for tumors of the head and neck are common. The highest incidence of complications occurred 1 to 5 years after radiotherapy, but long-term follow-up is indicated because complications may appear years after radiotherapy.\r"

All dogs were fed a diet containing 26% protein. Six dogs with a GFR less than 10 ml/min (8% to 17% of control two-kidney GFR) were killed within 6 months after renal mass reduction. Twenty-four-hour urinary protein excretion was modestly although definitely increased (236 +/- 26 mg/24 hr, P less than 0.01). All remnant kidneys demonstrated structural changes of mesangial hyperplasia or focal glomerular sclerosis. Ten dogs with a remnant kidney and early GFRs 16% to 39% of control values were followed for 18 to 39 months. In seven dogs, GFR showed little tendency to decrease with time. In one of them, proteinuria was 106 mg/24 hr with normal-appearing glomeruli at 14 months. In three dogs, proteinuria was progressive, averaging about 1 gm/24 hr at 18 months and 2 gm/24 hr at 24 to 34 months; glomerular pathologic findings progressed from focal mesangial hyperplasia or focal glomerular sclerosis at 8 to 16 months to focal and segmental sclerosis or diffuse glomerular obsolescence at 25 to 34 months; and fasting GFR progressively declined starting at 21 to 24 months after renal mass reduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A potential mechanism explaining the inability of the host to clear this infection may be in part a result of the inability of the neutrophil to localize at the site of an established infection. To study this question, either acute (4 hours old) or chronic (2 weeks old) abscesses caused by Staphylococcus aureus were created in perforated capsules implanted in the peritoneal cavity of rabbits. Homologous neutrophils were obtained from donor rabbits 4 hours after peritoneal glycogen stimulation and labeled with indium 111 oxine. Only 0.71% of injected 111In-labeled neutrophils localized in the chronic abscesses, compared with 1.77% in acute abscesses (P less than or equal to 0.01). Animals with chronic infections had a lower intravascular recovery of injected neutrophils (P less than 0.002). Failure of neutrophil localization was not associated with less chemotactic activity within the abscess, as measured by a chemotaxis-under-agarose assay, or caused by a barrier surrounding the abscess as detected by radionuclide imaging. Only 0.07% of injected neutrophils localized into acute abdominal abscesses in animals with a concomitant chronic subcutaneous abscess. These chronically infected animals also demonstrated a low peak intravascular recovery of injected neutrophils when compared with animals with only an acute infection (P less than 0.002). These data reveal that neutrophils localize to abscesses poorly in animals with chronic infections. The mechanism is possibly related to a systemic factor(s) associated with a lower intravascular recovery of injected neutrophils in chronically infected animals.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the hypothesis that androgens influence prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis in rat male genitalia. Prostaglandin synthesis was measured on the basis of the amount of prostaglandin released per unit weight of tissue over time. On this basis, castration increased the synthesis rate of radioimmunoassayable PGE2 from 1.3 +/- 2.5 to 7.4 +/- 2.5 ng/mg protein/180 min (P less than 0.01) in slices of prostate gland, and from 8.5 +/- 1.5 to 24.9 +/- 4.1 ng/mg protein/180 min (P less than 0.01) in slices of seminal vesicle, but decreased PGE2 formation from 27.8 +/- 2.0 to 14.3 +/- 1.2 ng/mg protein/180 min (P less than 0.01) in the vas deferens. Castration had no effect on synthesis of PGE2 in slices of renal cortex or liver. The peak effect of castration for each tissue was variable, ranging from 4 to 14 days. Treatment of castrated animals with testosterone reversed the effect of castration on prostatic prostaglandin biosynthesis: control 1.62 +/- 0.26 ng/mg protein/180 min, castrate 6.05 +/- 1.10 ng/mg protein/180 min, and castrate treated with testosterone T 1.72 +/- 0.16 ng/mg protein/180 min. Testosterone administration also decreased PGE2 formation in normal (noncastrate) animals from 1.62 +/- 0.26 to 0.91 +/- 0.23 ng/mg protein/180 min (P less than 0.04). Similar patterns of stimulation or reduction in biosynthesis of PGF2 alpha and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were also observed. When considered for the whole gland and not per slice, all the differences disappeared. These results demonstrate that the androgenic effect on the male genitalia occurs in a component of the gland that is unrelated to the production of prostaglandins and that prostaglandin synthesis is maintained despite the occurrence of widespread atrophy.\r"

We have therefore explored the feasibility of studying primaquine metabolism in cultured human cells. We found that the biotransformation of primaquine can be investigated in vitro in serum-supplemented liquid cultures of partially synchronized and exponentially growing human erythroleukemic K562 cells. Further, these cells can be replaced by cells present in normal bone marrow. Primaquine is rapidly and predominantly converted in vitro into carboxyprimaquine (CPQ) in a quantitative manner and without further modification. In addition to CPQ, a compound Xc that is not 6-methoxy-8-aminoquinoline, and is not derived from CPQ, appears in minor amounts in a delayed fashion. With the K562 as well as with the bone marrow cells the formation of CPQ from primaquine can be totally blocked by large concentrations of the nitrosourea, 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-nitrosourea (BCNU). With bone marrow, increasing blockade of CPQ formation by BCNU leads invariably to a progressive and striking accumulation of Xc. The availability of reproducible, quantitative, and practical new tools for the study of primaquine metabolism in vitro raises a number of challenging questions and may improve understanding of the mode of action, toxicology, and pharmacogenetics of 8-aminoquinolines.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium influx is important to basophil histamine release, and even though a cromolyn-binding protein has been proposed to constitute a Ca2+ channel, the pathway of Ca2+ influx or involvement of a Ca2+ channel in this process has yet to be established. We evaluated the effects of a dihydropyridine antagonist, nitrendipine, and agonist, BAY k 8644, on human basophil histamine release. Nitrendipine inhibited ragweed antigen E-dependent basophil histamine release in a dose-dependent fashion with a 50% inhibitory dose of 3.7 (+/- 1.1) X 10(-6) mol/L, and maximal inhibition of histamine release (41.8% +/- 7.1%) was achieved with 1.0 X 10(-5) mol/L nitrendipine. Increased extracellular concentrations of Ca2+ reduced nitrendipine inhibition of histamine release. In contrast, the Ca2+ agonist, BAY k 8644, enhanced antigen E-dependent histamine release with an ED50 value of 5.0 (+/- 1.1) X 10(-6) mol/L. BAY k 8644 by itself, however, did not cause basophil histamine release nor did it enhance histamine release to the calcium ionophore A23187. Further, when the effects of BAY k 8644 on basophil histamine release were evaluated in the presence of nitrendipine, the enhancing action of BAY k 8644 was diminished in a competitive fashion. Therefore, even though these compounds act at specific Ca2+ channels in other tissues, our data do not establish either the presence of such channels in the IgE-dependent histamine release process of basophils or the mechanism of action for dihydropyridines in basophil histamine secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All but three had morphologically normoblastic hematopoiesis, and 15 were not even anemic. None of those tested excreted methylmalonic acid or homocystine. Nevertheless, the dUST identified metabolic abnormalities in 18 of the 25 cases. In vitro additives were essential in the dUST. Especially noteworthy was MTHF, whose addition unmasked an otherwise undetectable dUST abnormality in four cases. Why MTHF appears to act as a \"stress test\" in this setting is unknown but deserves further attention. Seven patients had early forms of classical malabsorptive states such as pernicious anemia, defined by abnormal Schilling test results. Among the rest, seven of 13 patients displayed malabsorption of protein-bound cobalamin despite normal absorption of free cobalamin by the Schilling test. In two patients, initially normal Schilling test results became abnormal the following year. These findings demonstrate that seemingly falsely low serum cobalamin levels often indicate subtle biochemical cobalamin deficiency. Early stages of pernicious anemia or other classical malabsorptive states are sometimes responsible for such subtle deficiency. However, malabsorption confined to protein-bound cobalamin is an equally common cause. Current concepts of cobalamin deficiency and the absorptive defects that can cause it should be expanded to include atypical defects requiring newer methods of identification.\r"

These results confirm those obtained in rats 4 weeks after they had been made diabetic by an injection of streptozocin. Platelet survival was also prolonged in the nondiabetic littermates (normoglycemic) of diabetic rats indicating that the effect on platelet survival may be unrelated to blood glucose concentrations. The mechanism responsible for this prolongation of platelet survival is unclear. Thus, under these experimental conditions in which rats do not have vascular disease, diabetes is associated with prolonged platelet survival. Vascular injury induced by indwelling aortic catheters shortened platelet survival to the same extent in diabetic rats, their nondiabetic littermates, and controls. There was a significantly greater accumulation of platelets on the damaged aortas of diabetic animals than on the aortas of nondiabetic littermates or controls. This could be a result of increased accumulation or decreased turnover of platelets on the vessel wall; macroscopic thrombi were not observed in any of the groups with indwelling aortic catheters. We conclude that the prolongation of platelet survival previously observed in rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes is attributable to the diabetic state and not to some other effect of the drug and that chronic diabetes in rats in the absence of vascular disease is not necessarily associated with shortened platelet survival.\r"

To determine the density distribution of homozygous sickle hemoglobin cells as a function of cell hydration, cells were incubated in autologous plasma buffer mixtures with final osmolalities ranging from 195 to 490 mosm/kg at ambient Po2. The density distribution of the cells was determined by differential flotation on 20 mixtures of di-n-butyl and dimethyl phthalates with specific gravities of 1.062 to 1.142. Mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and mean cell volume (MCV) were determined by standard manual procedures. Cell shape was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the axial ratio (L/W) of the elliptical dense cell fraction measured by an image analyzer interfaced with a computer. The density distribution of normal red blood cells lies within a narrow 1.090 to 1.118 gm/ml density band with the middle or transitional 60% (T60) of the cells occupying a density range of 0.0067 +/- 0.0007 gm/ml (+/- SD). The density distribution of sickle cells shows a broader density band of 1.064 to 1.134 gm/ml, and the T60 was 0.0139 +/- 0.0022 gm/ml. The mean T60 did not change with osmotic variation but the mean T60 of Hb SS cells was significantly greater (P less than 0.005). MCHC and 1/MCV varied directly with the median density of the density distribution. By linear regression analysis and Ponder's osmotic equation, it is evident that sickle cells exhibit restricted volume increases in hypotonic media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To examine the role of the platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa) complex in these processes, we performed studies in patients with platelets deficient in GPIIb-IIIa (thrombasthenia) or GPIb (Bernard-Soulier syndrome) in the Baumgartner system with human umbilical artery segments at a wall shear rate of 2600 sec-1. Morphometry specified the percentage of the subendothelial surface covered with contact (C) or spread (S) platelets or platelet thrombi. Total platelet adherence was defined as C + S. In thrombasthenia, C showed a small but significant increase compared with controls, whereas C + S was reduced by approximately 40%; thrombi were totally absent. With Bernard-Soulier platelets, each parameter was reduced by 72% to 93%. To verify that these findings were related to the epitopes involved in VWF, fibronectin, and fibrinogen binding, we incubated normal blood with monoclonal antibodies to the GPIIb-IIIa complex (10E5 and PLT-1) or GPIb (6D1), and these experiments yielded results similar to those observed with thrombasthenic and Bernard-Soulier platelets, respectively. By transmission electron microscopy, normal platelets preincubated with 10E5 or thrombasthenic platelets showed abnormally short and blunt pseudopodia, suggesting that the platelet GPIIb-IIIa complex plays a role in platelet spreading on subendothelium. Our observations confirm that platelet spreading is mediated at least in part by the epitope(s) of the GPIIb-IIIa complex involved in adhesive protein binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Particular attention was paid to the relationship of screening to the diagnosis of these cancers. Sixty-nine cancers were diagnosed during the study period. Screening detected 7 of 11 breast cancers, 2 of 11 colorectal cancers, and 2 of 3 cervical cancers. In addition, all cases of respiratory cancer occurred in cigarette smokers and were therefore theoretically preventable. The data suggest that a large population of inactive, unscreened patients is a major obstacle to cancer prevention.\r"

Common causes of positive hepatobiliary scanning, other than acalculus cholecystitis, include chronic cholecystitis, cholecystitis, hepatitis, alcoholism, total parenteral nutrition, pancreatitis, prolonged fasting, and ingestion of food less than one hour prior to scanning.

Psychological and somatic symptoms and physician interventions were used to create classification criteria. Prevalence was higher by self-report than by physician assessment. The single checklist item \"depression\" appeared to yield a valid prevalence estimate. Agreement between self-report and physician recognition was low. Prevalence estimates were enhanced when single-visit patients were excluded. The findings suggest that patients who report depression by questionnaire may differ from those admitting depression to physicians; therefore, patient and physician characteristics are likely to contribute to the underrecognition of depression in primary care.\r"

After a mean length of care of slightly over two years, the charts were reviewed for frequency of visits to primary care providers (internal medicine or family practice), Emergency Room, Acute Care Clinic, and all clinics other than the two primary care clinics. The records were also reviewed for laboratory tests ordered. Frequency of visits to the clinic of primary care, Emergency Room, Acute Care Clinic, and broken appointments were all significantly higher for patients randomized to the Internal Medicine Clinic. In addition, the median total annual cost of laboratory tests for patients followed by internal medicine physicians was significantly higher, largely because of higher laboratory charges generated by the specialist consultants. Over the study period, internal medicine patients had a significantly higher number of visits to all nonprimary care clinics and specifically to the dermatology, obstetrics and gynecology, and general surgery consultant clinics. It can be concluded that in this clinical environment, the practice styles of internal medicine and family practice are different.\r"

In 11 cases, cocaine was found in the blood (average concentration: 0.57 mg/L, range: 0.05 to 1.45 mg/L), whereas in the remainder, cocaine or its major metabolite was found in the urine or other tissues. In the majority of decedents, autopsy disclosed the existence of severe natural disease which could have been exacerbated by the administration of stimulant drugs, including cocaine. These data, and a review of the current medical literature, indicate that cocaine may precipitate the sudden death of an individual with undiagnosed cardiovascular disease. A contributory role of cocaine should be considered in any apparently natural death occurring in a population where cocaine abuse is prevalent.\r"

Although often the result of a dental infection, injuries of the soft tissues of the neck may also initiate rampant cellulitis, and recognition of the underlying etiology of such cases is necessary to determine properly the manner of death. Five cases of NFN are presented with a review of the causative factors and usual bacteriology, and specific factors of medicolegal interest are addressed.\r"

Analysis of small particles by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) can be accomplished without destruction or injury of the particles. In one case, the detection and identification of mineral fragments embedded near the nose of a bullet provided conclusive evidence that the bullet had ricocheted from a fireplace before striking the victim. In the second case, analysis of particles from two bullets identified them as them as bone fragments, thus proving which shots fired from a police officer's gun had killed a suspected burglar. SEM-EDXA has not been widely used to identify such material on bullets, but should be considered a potentially powerful tool in forensic science.\r"

In this study, 573 blood specimens from suspected driving while intoxicated individuals (DWI blood) and 532 postmortem blood specimens (PM blood) were analyzed by the REA method and a headspace gas chromatographic method (GC) currently used in this laboratory. \"Negative\" specimens (less than 10 mg/dL by GC) and \"positive\" specimens (greater than or equal to 10 mg/dL by GC) in each category were analyzed. Linear regression analysis comparing the REA values with the GC values was performed for each type of blood specimen. The equation obtained for DWI blood specimens was REA = 0.943 GC + 1.54; the equation for PM blood specimens was REA = 0.980 GC + 2.76. The correlation coefficient for each group was greater than 0.99. The data suggested that a limit of detection of 10 mg/dL could be applied for DWI blood specimens, while 20 mg/dL would be recommended as the limit of detection for PM blood specimens.\r"

This study uses an automated particle search and characterization program for unattended GSR search and identification. This system allows for automatic matrix search, particle sizing, chemical typing, and spectral aquisition with subsequent storage of data to disk for later operator review and verification. This work describes various aspects of the program, determines appropriate parameters adequate for both unique and characteristic GSR particle identification, and evaluates the reliability of data obtained. Samples are collected via the tape lift method from test-firings of .38, .32, .25, and .22 caliber handguns at time after firing intervals of 0 to 6 h. Unique GSR particles are consistently and correctly identified by this method on tape lift samples taken up to 4 h after firing. False positive results of unique GSR particles are not encountered on control handblank samples. This technique appears to provide the forensic science community with an operator-free method of reliable GSR particle search and an improved analyst-time-per-case ratio.\r"

The present study was designed to explore the relationship between arousal level in normal subjects and their performance on the span of apprehension task. Consistent with Gjerde's proposals, the normal subjects who expressed high levels of trait anxiety were significantly and selectively impaired on the more complex conditions of the task, a performance pattern similar to that exhibited by schizophrenic subjects in previous research. These data illustrate the influence that arousal level may exert on tasks purporting to reflect attentional abnormalities among schizophrenic subjects.\r"

This paper reports a feasibility study for one kind of investigation: the use of clinical records to survey the DSM-III diagnoses and therapy outcome of 30 patients who had outpatient psychotherapy. We were interested in what range of DSM-III diagnoses was represented by patients in outpatient therapy; whether judgments of diagnosis and outcome could be made reliably from clinical records; how well patients in the therapy fit DSM-III diagnoses; if patients did not fit well, why not? We found that an exploration of the relationship between DSM-III diagnosis and outcome from clinical records is feasible; a relatively wide range (13) of DSM-III diagnoses was represented by the 30 patients; 80% of the patients fit well or moderately well into a DSM-III diagnosis; most of the 20% who did not fit well represent the class of problems of living, which does not mean, however, that their problems were minor or unimportant; in some cases the diagnosis--even when it fit the patient well--did not express the essence of the problem for which he or she was to be treated; there was a small correlation (.19) between the patient's rating on axis V and therapy outcome. The findings are discussed in terms of the pro and con arguments that have been made about DSM-III.\r"

This cross-cultural replication of earlier research findings in London and southern California suggests that critical, hostile, or emotionally overinvolved attitudes and behaviors may be general major stressors that adversely influence the fragile adaptation of schizophrenic individuals in diverse cultural settings. The finding of a lower prevalence of high levels of expressed emotion among Mexican-American compared to Anglo-American and British households lends support to the hypothesis that intrafamilial behaviors may account for different schizophrenic outcomes in different cultures.\r"

Patients were evaluated multidimensionally at index admission and after 21 to 33 months, at which time 19 cooperated in follow-up involving clinical, functional, psychometric, and objective outcome measures. Multiple regression analysis found that combinations of 3 to 4 index variables significantly predicted 13 of 14 outcome measures, yielding multiple R values between .63 and .93 (X = .78). In total, a set of eight parameters contributed in explaining the outcome variance. The strongest overall predictor of favorable outcome was baseline negative syndrome. Other significant predictors were good premorbid school functioning, favorable prior disposition, sudden onset of illness, nonparanoid subdiagnosis, family history of alcoholism, psychomotor retardation, and depression. Accordingly, a patient's premorbid adjustment, course of illness, and presenting clinical profile provided nonoverlapping sources of outcome prediction. Of these three dimensions, it was proposed that the prognostic significance of the clinical profile may be phase specific, carrying different implications when assessed in the acute vs. chronic stage of illness.\r"

Most assaults were not a significant threat to the attacked person, but a small number were highly dangerous. Assaultive patients were significantly younger, and a greater proportion had a previous history of violence, compared with nonassaultive patients. A previous history of violent behavior was linked to more previous hospitalizations, indicating that such behavior might be associated with a poor prognosis.\r"

A pharmacological mechanism for the rapid amelioration of pathological affect by tricyclic medications and its possible relationship to the newly discovered descending motor systems of the brain that use norepinephrine and serotonin as neurotransmitters is offered. These cases also suggest that pathological affect is a valuable clinical indicator of an underlying major depression in some brain-injured patients.\r"

The latter, however, more often exhibited family and personal history of psychiatric illness, early awakening, guilt, suicidal ideas, shorter index episodes of depression, and better response to treatment. The three samples were followed up for a period of up to 5 years. The index sample did worse on follow-up than did the depressed and the neurological samples. The disease profiles of both the index and neurological samples were similar, but there were more cases of epilepsy in the former.

Electrogustometric values both in patients before and after surgery for trigeminal neuralgia and in patients with trigeminal sensory neuropathy were determined.

Electrogustometry is a convenient method for clinically assessing taste.\r"

Stimuli consisted of short dorsiflexions of the index finger during background force and in tilting (toe up) of a movable platform on which the subject stood. The most important findings were increased long latency responses in upper and lower extremities. For hand muscles it was the late part of the long latency complex, which was increased. For leg muscles it was the long latency response in the anterior tibialis muscle, the antagonist of the stretched triceps surae. The medium latency response in the triceps surae was unaffected. Latencies of the early segmental reflexes and the long latency responses were normal except for cases with peripheral neuropathy (moderate increase in latency of all EMG responses) and diseases affecting both the peripheral nerves and the dorsal columns (for example Friedreich's ataxia). The latter leads to a pronounced delay of the short latency response and a massive delay of the long latency complex in the first dorsal interosseus and of the long latency response in the anterior tibialis muscle.\r"

Confluent monolayers of cells positive for Factor VIII-related antigen were obtained by seven days in culture. The cells were: incubated in media containing 1 M, 2 M or 3 M urea and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for various periods of time and then examined by transmission electron microscopy. Exposed to hypertonic urea solutions and 14C-3-O-methyl-D-glucose for determination of the intracellular water space. In control cultures endothelial cells were bound together by tight junctional complexes over 91% of which excluded HRP. In experimental cultures 82% of the interendothelial clefts became permeable to HRP after one minute of incubation with 3 M urea. The degree of cell shrinkage corresponded well with the extent of junctional opening. In monolayers examined 24 hours following removal of urea from the media more than 63% of the intercellular clefts were impermeable to HRP. These observations indicate that hyperosmotic solutions of urea reversibly open the tight junctions between brain microvessel endothelial cells in tissue culture. Decrease in cell volume appears to be linked to the increased junctional permeability.\r"

  ".W": "Excessive tissue lactic acidosis is considered to be detrimental to the central nervous system (CNS) and may adversely affect recovery from anoxia, ischemia, trauma and epilepsy. Since astrocytes are believed to play a role in pH regulation in the CNS, we studied the effect of this acid on primary astrocyte cultures. Cells exposed to lactic acid showed chromatin clumping, an increase of lipid and dense bodies, a loss of polyribosomal clusters, slightly increased cytoplasmic lucency, swollen mitochondria and tangled intermediate filaments. These alterations progressed with lower pH and longer exposure. Irreversible changes occurred one to two hours after exposure at pH 6; after 30 to 60 minutes (min) at pH 5.5 and after ten to 30 min at pH 5. Comparable results were obtained with the use of other weak acids indicating that the observed changes were due to increased hydrogen ion concentration rather than secondary to lactate per se. Additionally, various concentrations of lactic acid adjusted to identical pH produced similar morphologic alterations. Thus, while lactic acid caused marked and at times irreversible alterations in astrocytes, severe and prolonged acidosis was required to produce such injurious effects. This relative resistance of astrocytes to acidosis is in keeping with their potential role in pH regulation in brain.\r"

  ".U": "87140147\r", 
  ".W": "Eight additional cases of tangled masses of unmyelinated fine axons occurring in the brain stem in association with cystic infarcts or traumatic cysts are described. Because they are solely composed of bare axons and because of their consistent association with old, destructive lesions, they are called axonomas in lieu of the previous designation as non-myelinated neuromas. Axonomas were located at the border of the associated lesions exclusively in or near the central tegmental tract of the midbrain, pons or medulla. Their occurrence in the restricted region is considered as the reason for their rarity and for the failure to observe them in the past. The discrete, compact, mass formation, the occurrence of a large number in groups, the exclusive occurrence in specific regions of the central nervous system (CNS), and the consistent association with old axonal injury are presented as circumstantial evidence that axonomas represent regenerative growths of central axons. Based on the restricted site of predilection, it is inferred that axonomas originate from a special group or groups of CNS neurons which may have an exceptionally high capacity to regenerate. In other words, certain central neurons in man are not only capable of abundant regenerative sprouting but also are able to sustain the newly formed sprouts in the form of axonomas for years or perhaps permanently, but the specific neurons are not yet identified.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated whether vacuolated cervical anterior horn cells of the wobbler mouse maintain axons to the periphery, and if these morphologically abnormal neurons are capable of supporting axonal regeneration. Using retrograde axonal transport, we applied horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to peripheral nerves or muscles and with electron microscopy sought evidence for perikaryal labeling in vacuolated neurons in 23 wobbler mice. When HRP was injected into forelimb muscles, 12 of 36 vacuolated neurons became positively labeled indicating that these neurons have axons in continuity with the periphery. In regeneration studies, after nerve crush at the brachial plexus, 23 out of 85 vacuolated neurons were labeled after HRP application at the elbow level. However, after a sufficient regeneration period, none of the 36 vacuolated neurons were labeled if HRP was applied in muscles below the elbow. In all experiments, morphologically normal neurons were always labeled. Our studies indicate that some vacuolated neurons of wobbler mice not only maintain axons into the periphery, but are also capable of supporting regeneration. However, the overall function of these vacuolated neurons appears marginal compared with the majority of morphologically normal neurons in this motor neuron disease.\r"

Whereas there was an elevated helper T/suppressor T ratio in CSF of patients with NID (Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, cerebral vasculitis), no other significant differences could be detected between the different groups of patients. Our results suggest that analysis of these mononuclear cell subsets in CSF is not helpful in discriminating between MS and other neurological diseases and that in MS patients changes in disease activity are not clearly indicated by fluctuations in the different CSF cell subsets. Further studies will be needed to confirm our findings in NID patients and to understand the diagnostic and theoretical implications.\r"

Examination of the patient 2.5 years later revealed the presence of the crocodile tears syndrome, mucus secretion and the salivary atropine paradox, i.e. severe hyperaemia of the paretic half of the face during intense salivation in response to atropine. Other patients who suffered similar trauma but had no operation demonstrated the same syndrome. The crocodile tears syndrome is considered to be a result of an ephaptic union of the central portion of the damaged lesser superficial petrosal nerve (SPN) with the peripheral portion of the greater SPN. The salivary atropine paradox is then due to the loss of the peripheral portion of the former nerve combined with denervation of the salivary parotid gland. Facial hyperaemia during intense salivation after atropine administration is explained as a result of the intensified release of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide from the gland, stimulated by atropine, into the blood circulation.\r"

Finally, specific antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay. The diagnosis of a borreliosis was not considered initially because there was no history of tick-bite or erythema chronicum migrans, and the neurological involvement of the central nervous system seemed unusual. The latency between the first symptoms and diagnosis varied from 3 months to 5 years. After a parenteral, high-dose therapy with penicillin, there was a significant improvement in all patients. In two cases, there was evidence of intrathecally produced antibodies to myelin basic protein.\r"

The enzyme, in situ, was visualized under the electron microscope by incubating ultrathin frozen sections of fibroblasts with antibodies against glucocerebrosidase, followed by a second incubation with goat anti- (rabbit IgG) coupled to colloidal gold. In control cells, most of the gold label was found in lysosomes, associated with the membrane. Labelling of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and Golgi complex was also observed. In fibroblasts from three Gaucher's disease patients without neurological symptoms (type 1 disease), a near normal amount of cross-reactive material (CRM) was detected in lysosomes, but in a fourth such patient, the lysosomal CRM was reduced. Little lysosomal glucocerebrosidase was detected in cells from patients with the acute neuronopathic form (type 2) or the subacute neuronopathic form (type 3) of Gaucher's disease. CRM in lysosomes correlates with amount of mature, 59 kDA glucocerebrosidase which is undetectable in type 2 and type 3 Gaucher's disease cell lines. These findings demonstrate that different mutations in the gene for glucocerebrosidase result in mutant proteins that have different intracellular localizations. They also suggest that there is a relationship between the amount of cross-reactive material in the lysosomes and the phenotypic expression of the disease.\r"

Using both the mechanical and the electromyographic devices, we recorded the times for first return of twitch, as well as for 25% and 75% recovery of twitch height compared with prerelaxant twitch baseline values and compared the values by calculating least-squares regression lines. Times given by the electromyographic device for these measures of returning neuromuscular function were notably longer than those given by the mechanical evoked force monitor. No such findings have been reported in previous studies that compared these two techniques for monitoring of muscle recovery from nondepolarizing relaxants.

The thromboelastogram, by providing information on the interaction of all the coagulation precursors, gives more clinically useful information on coagulation than that available from the coagulation profile or the activated clotting time alone. This study was done to assess the usefulness of thromboelastography in open-heart surgery. Thirty-eight patients (29 undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and 9 undergoing valve replacement) were studied with activated clotting time, thromboelastography, and coagulation profiles during three periods: before bypass, during bypass, and after protamine administration. Thromboelastography was a significantly better predictor (87% accuracy) of postoperative hemorrhage and need for reoperation than was the activated clotting time (30%) or coagulation profile (51%). Thromboelastography is easy to use and provides diagnostic data within 30 minutes of blood sampling.\r"

We define VO2max in these patients as an increase in VO2 of less than 1 ml/min/kg despite an increment in work load. The value for VO2max indicates the patient's aerobic capacity; it also predicts the maximal cardiac output during exercise and therefore serves as an estimate of cardiac reserve and of the severity of cardiac or circulatory failure. Symptom-limited VO2 during exercise, termed maximum oxygen uptake but more appropriately peak VO2, bears no relationship to VO2max. The two terms should not be used interchangeably.\r"

The author believes that such monitoring should not replace the use of a \"wake-up\" test during these procedures because of the recognized possible occurrence of false negative results (i.e., normal evoked potentials despite abnormal spinal cord function). Another apparent established practice is monitoring of brainstem auditory evoked potentials to recognize the onset of disturbance in the auditory system. It has not been established that other recommended evoked potential monitoring practices, such as somatosensory evoked potential monitoring for such purposes as recognizing cerebral ischemia, or brainstem auditory evoked potential monitoring for recognizing untoward medullary stimulation, are as good as or better for these purposes than currently recognized and simpler monitors.\r"

To assess the accuracy of this device, we anesthetized 4 dogs and monitored them continuously with arterial catheters and an intraarterial optode probe, and intermittently with arterial blood gas analysis. The inspired oxygen fraction was varied from 1.0 to 0.1, and arterial blood gases were measured for comparison with the optode reading. Two hundred ninety data sets yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.96, with a linear regression slope of 0.98 and intercept of 5.1 mm Hg. In the 72 data sets from the last dog, the bias and precision of the optode arterial oxygen tension values were -10.3 mm Hg and 20.0 mm Hg, respectively. The optode probe was easily inserted through a 20-gauge catheter and did not interfere with continuous arterial pressure measurement or blood sampling. This study suggests that the optode has great potential as a continuous, real-time monitor of arterial oxygen tension.\r"

Measurements were made by the arterial volume-clamp method of Penaz. The FINAP measurements were compared with pressure data obtained ipsilaterally from a radial artery catheter-transducer system (intraarterial pressure [IAP]) to find optimal recording conditions and to document factors affecting FINAP readings. The thumb, with a specially designed cuff, gave the most accurate results. The mean FINAP - IAP difference for the thumb was -4.8 mm Hg for systolic pressure, 1.49 mm Hg for diastolic pressure, and 0.29 mm Hg for mean pressure. The differences were statistically significant for systolic and diastolic pressure but not for mean pressure. The regression slope for thumb systolic FINAP/IAP was 0.979, that for thumb diastolic FINAP/IAP was 0.963, and that for mean thumb FINAP/IAP was 0.996, whereas the intercepts were 7.499 for systolic pressure, 0.802 for diastolic pressure, and 0.083 for mean pressure. The correlation coefficients were 0.945 (systolic), 0.884 (diastolic), and 0.949 (mean). The correlation coefficients with the other fingers ranged from 0.502 to 0.922 for systolic pressure, 0.757 to 0.932 for diastolic pressure, and 0.767 to 0.892 for mean pressure. The slopes for the various finger-cuff combinations ranged from 0.537 to 0.996, and the intercepts ranged from 0.083 to 32.387 from mean pressure. In 3 patients (6%) the FINAP measurement was not possible because of insufficient peripheral circulation. In 9 other patients (18%) the FINAP measurements were not accurate during some periods of time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-nine evaluable patients under 65 years of age with measurable metastatic breast cancer and without prior chemotherapy were randomly assigned to treatment with fluorouracil, Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and cyclophosphamide (FAC) at standard or high doses (100% to 260% higher than standard FAC) following a dose escalation schedule. Patients randomized to the high-dose FAC received the first three cycles of therapy within a protected environment. Subsequent cycles for this group were administered at standard doses of FAC in an ambulatory setting, the same as for the control group. After reaching 450 mg/m2 of Adriamycin, patients in both groups continued treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil until there was disease progression. Analysis of pretreatment patient characteristics showed an even distribution for most known pretreatment factors, although the control group had slightly (but nonsignificantly) more favorable prognostic characteristics. Fourteen patients (24%) achieved a complete remission (CR) and 32 (54%) achieved a partial remission (PR), for an overall major response rate of 78%. There were no differences in overall, CR, or PR rates between the high-dose FAC and control groups. The median response durations were 11 and 10 months for the protected environment and control groups, respectively, and the median survival was 20 months for both groups. Hematologic, gastrointestinal (GI), and infection-related complications were significantly more frequent and severe in the group treated with high-dose chemotherapy. Stomatitis, diarrhea, and skin toxicity were dose-limiting. However, there were no treatment-related deaths. High-dose induction combination chemotherapy with the agents used in this study failed to increase the response rate or survival duration, and resulted in a substantial increase in toxicity.\r"

Multivariate analyses, through a stepwise procedure, showed that the most important prognostic variables are Hb, hepatomegaly, lymph node involvement, PB lymphocytosis, and age and sex of patients. Further covariates would produce an improvement having a nonsignificant P value. Based on the results of multivariate analyses, a four-step staging using the significant variables of the Cox model is proposed.\r"

A total of 208 patients with recurrent lymphoma were treated with this regimen. Response rates were 24% for complete remission and 36% for partial remission. The MIME regimen was more effective in patients who were treated after being off front-line therapy for longer than 6 months. However, responses were also seen in patients with disease clearly resistant to front-line therapy, suggesting that MIME was at least partially non-cross-resistant with front-line doxorubicin-containing regimens. The 15-month median relapse-free survival of complete responders and the 9-month overall median survival time for all patients treated were both similar to results from previous ifosfamide-VP-16 combination use. This regimen has been effective in the treatment of patients with recurrent or refractory lymphoma, but cannot be considered curative in the majority of cases.\r"

The median survival in NN-lymphocytic poorly differentiated (LPD) was 77.2 months v 44.3 months for ND-LPD.

Therefore, we began a phase II trial of the combination of HU and ara-C to determine the efficacy and toxicity of this combination in treatment of patients with refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Chemotherapy began with HU 500 mg administered orally every six hours for four doses. Twelve hours following the fourth HU dose, ara-C 100 mg/m2/d was administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for three days. Concomitantly with the three-day ara-C infusion, patients again received HU 500 mg orally every four hours. Cycles of therapy were repeated every 28 days. Twenty-five patients ranging in age from 26 to 70 years were enrolled in the study. Of 21 patients evaluable for response, nine (43%) obtained complete (CR) or partial remissions (PR). Most responding patients had either large-cell or cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and all but two had a performance status of 0 to 1 at entry in the study. The median survival for all responding patients was 13 months compared with 2.5 months for nonresponders. Patients obtaining a CR had a median survival of 27.5 months, and two of the four CRs remain alive and in remission at 10+ and 30+ months from achievement of CR status. The primary toxic effect of this regimen was bone marrow suppression. The median WBC nadir was 2,200 cells/microL, and the median platelet nadir was 80,000/microL. Other toxicities included mild nausea and vomiting and diffuse maculopapular rash. This biochemically rational approach to enhancing ara-C activity may have significant clinical utility and should be further explored in treatment of patients with large-cell and cutaneous T cell lymphomas.\r"

Eight of 14 (57%) patients with mediastinal and retroperitoneal GCTs achieved complete remission (CR), and five (36%) remain alive and free of disease. Fourteen of 27 patients (52%) with poor-risk testicular cancer achieved CR, and ten (37%) remain alive and free of disease. Two patients with seminoma, one each with a testicular and extragonadal primary tumor, achieved durable CRs. Toxicity was tolerable, but greater than that of VAB-6 alone. The response and survival of the 39 patients with nonseminomatous tumors were found to be identical to the results of 29 patients with nonseminomatous GCTs and poor-risk characteristics who were treated with VAB-6 alone. Thus, this 6-month schedule of alternating months of chemotherapy is not recommended for patients with poor-risk GCTs. Patients with such tumors should be referred to centers conducting prospective trials, so that research seeking better therapy may continue.\r"

There were 74 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and 29 patients with anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). AZQ plus BCNU produced partial (PR) or unequivocal responses in seven of 32 (21.9%) patients with GBMs and three of ten (30%) patients with AAs. Two patients with GBMs (6.3%) and five patients with AAs (50%) showed stable disease (SD). AZQ plus procarbazine produced PRs or unequivocal responses in five of 42 (11.9%) patients with GBMs and nine of 19 (47.4%) patients with AAs. Eight patients with GBMs (19%) and one patient with an AA (5.2%) showed SD. In addition to histologic diagnosis, only the Karnofsky performance-status (KPS) rating independently influenced response and survival. Differences in response rates between the two regimens were not significant, although estimated median survival after adjusting for performance status was slightly better with AZQ plus BCNU than with AZQ plus procarbazine (P = .031). Neither age nor prior chemotherapy were significant independent risk factors. Toxicity was mild and primarily hematologic. We conclude that these AZQ-based regimens have activity in patients with recurrent anaplastic gliomas, but that they are not clearly superior to other agents in current use. The histologic diagnosis of GBM is associated with a significantly worse prognosis than AA, and we believe that this important distinction must be recognized in phase II as well as phase III trials.\r"

AGP measurements identified limited-disease patients more frequently than LDH or CEA, and a combination of markers (AGP and LDH) improves the accuracy of correctly classifying patients with active disease. Each of the markers correctly tracked the clinical response to therapy in approximately two thirds of the subjects. The use of a combination of markers should be considered for monitoring the therapy of SCLC in future clinical trials.\r"

Fifty-four cases from the eligible group were entered into a randomized prospective trial of the efficacy of BRT in decreasing local recurrence. In the eligible patients, major wound complications occurred in nine of 41 (22%) of the BRT cases, compared with two of 64 (3%) of the non-BRT patients, which was a significant increase (P = .002). The combined frequency of major and moderate wound complications was also significantly increased in the BRT (18 of 41, 44%) compared with the non-BRT (nine of 64, 14%) patients (P = .0006). The median duration to complete resolution of these complications was 189 days (14 to 597) in the BRT, compared with 49 (11 to 170) days in the non-BRT group (P = .0005); however, no amputations were required, and only 14% of the BRT-associated wound complications were of prolonged duration, ie, greater than 200 days. In the randomized study, both the total number of complications, and the combination of major and moderate complications were increased significantly in the BRT v the non-BRT patients. Adjuvant Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) administered in 60 mg/m2 increments to a cumulative dose of 540 mg/m2 did not appear to impair wound healing even when administered within 15 days of operation. Significant wound complications occur in major resections of extremity and superficial truncal sarcomas. If the addition of adjuvant BRT produces a decrease in local recurrence, then either patient selection will have to be more rigidly applied, especially in wounds where skin flap blood supply is tenuous, or the technique will need to be modified to balance the short-term aim of reducing wound complications with the long-term goal of local tumor control.\r"

Site specific patient management guidelines (PMGs) were developed by physicians who saw a majority of cancer patients in each community and represent a consensus of the most current information on pretreatment evaluation and management for each cancer site. There was the potential for PMGs to have a strong effect on physician practice patterns. A patterns of care study (POC) was conducted in the 17 CHOPs to determine the influence of guidelines on practice patterns. The practice elements examined in this report are clinical staging for breast and small-cell lung cancer, medical oncology consultation for breast cancer patients with positive lymph nodes, and radiation therapy consultation for rectal and small-cell lung cancer. These elements were in all CHOP guidelines. Except for physicians most active in the CHOP, the data provide no evidence of diffusion of guideline principles to the majority of practicing physicians. Although all guidelines contained discussion of the importance of staging before definitive treatment for breast cancer, only 33% of the 1,922 charts examined had a stage recorded. In small-cell lung cancer, 67% of the 388 charts examined had stage recorded. The years in practice of the primary physician had an inverse relationship to practice patterns as defined by the guidelines. Physician specialty was also a determinant of practice patterns for small-cell lung cancer. However, participation in guideline development and their dissemination did not significantly influence the patterns of care elements examined in this study.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years, it has become evident that the most common form of arteriovenous malformation to involve the spinal cord in adults is a low-flow fistula with its nidus located on the dura in relation to the dorsal nerve root. This lesion, termed \"radiculomeningeal fistula\" (RMF), is drained by the intradural coronal venous system and most likely causes neurological deficits due to raised venous pressure within the spinal cord. The therapy that was formerly recommended was multilevel laminectomy with microsurgical stripping of the intradural vessels. However, that procedure focused on the draining veins rather than the nidus, and it has been replaced by direct treatment of the nidus or by disconnecting the nidus from the coronal venous system. This paper reports variants of RMF's that show a wider spectrum of the clinical and radiological findings than has been previously reported. Three patients presenting with extradural venous drainage, intraspinal hemorrhage, and/or sudden non-hemorrhagic neurological decline are reported. A more complete understanding of RMF facilitates the radiological and clinical evaluation of these patients and enables the surgeon to modify the therapy in a significant way.\r"

  ".W": "Hypertrophy of the posterior spinal elements leading to compromise of the spinal canal and its neural elements is a well-recognized pathological entity affecting the lumbar or cervical spine. Such stenosis of the thoracic spine in the absence of a generalized rheumatological, metabolic, or orthopedic disorder, or a history of trauma is generally considered to be rare. Over a 2-year period the authors have treated six cases of thoracic myelopathy associated with thoracic canal stenosis. In four patients the deficits developed gradually and painlessly. The three older patients had a clinical profile characterized by complaints of pseudoclaudication, spastic lower limbs, and evidence of posterior column dysfunction. Two patients were younger adults with low thoracic myelopathy associated with local back pain after minor trauma. Both patients also had congenital narrowing of the thoracic spinal canal. Oil and metrizamide contrast myelography in the prone position were of limited value in diagnosing this condition; in fact, myelography may be misleading and result in erroneous diagnosis of thoracic disc protrusion, when the principal problem is dorsal and lateral compression from hypertrophied facets. Magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography sector scanning were more useful in the diagnosis of this disorder than was myelography. Thoracic canal stenosis may be more common than is currently recognized and account for a portion of the failures in anterior and lateral decompression of thoracic disc herniations.\r"

A standardized interhemispheric approach through the posterior corpus callosum and into the atrium of the lateral ventricle was utilized for the surgical removal of these AVM's. Total removal was confirmed by angiography in 18 patients; removal was subtotal in four cases. There were no deaths in this group of patients. Disturbances of recent memory pre- and postoperatively were seen in half of the patients, but most of these deficits were temporary. Other complications included: postoperative homonymous hemianopsia (six cases), transient hemiparesis (three cases), hemisensory loss (two cases), Parinaud's syndrome (one case), and recurrent hemorrhage 2 years after surgery (one case). All 22 patients returned to their previous occupations and are leading independent lives. The results of this experience indicate that thalamocaudate AVM's can be effectively treated by resection.\r"

Of 915 patients 18 years of age or older who had a pathological diagnosis of malignant glioma and an initial Karnofsky performance scale score of 60% or higher, 36 (4%) developed venous thromboembolism 6 to 246 weeks postoperatively and 22 were treated with anticoagulant drugs. Anticoagulant therapy usually consisted of intravenous heparin for 7 to 10 days, followed for at least 3 to 6 months by either subcutaneous heparin (5000 to 8000 U twice daily) or oral warfarin. All patients were closely monitored to ensure control of hypertension, compliance with therapy, maintenance of prothrombin time within the therapeutic range, and early recognition of adverse side effects. No patient had an intracranial hemorrhage. Thus, anticoagulant agents can be safely administered after intracranial operations for malignant gliomas without increased risk of morbidity or mortality if the patients are carefully monitored according to established guidelines.\r"

Seventy-five patients (53%) were considered to be cured because the cysts or nodules disappeared or became calcified following praziquantel treatment and the patients were asymptomatic at the end of a 5-year follow-up period. An additional 35 patients (24.8%) improved clinically and radiographically. The intraventricular Cysticercus cysts of five patients in this group were not affected by praziquantel and had to be surgically removed. The remaining 31 patients (21.9%) were unchanged or became worse probably because, prior to therapy, Cysticercus larvae had caused tissue damage. The fact that praziquantel did not affect intraventricular cysts suggests a low concentration of the drug in the cerebrospinal fluid. Surgery continues to be an important tool in the treatment of cysticercosis to remove parasites that do not respond to praziquantel therapy as well as for the relief of intracranial hypertension.\r"

All patients had a decreased conductance to outflow (C out) of cerebrospinal fluid as measured by lumboventricular perfusion (C out less than 0.12 ml X mm Hg-1 X min-1). Computerized tomography (CT) scanning, clinical assessment, and neuropsychological grading were performed pre- and postoperatively. The preoperative CBF studies revealed abnormal flow patterns in all patients. Fourteen patients showed moderate-sized, large, or very large central low-flow areas, and four patients had reduced flow bilaterally in the occipital and contiguous temporoparietal regions. After shunting, six patients had a significant reduction in the size of the central low-flow area on the CBF map, agreeing well with the changes of ventricular size on the CT scan. All six patients showed an improvement in either clinical or neuropsychological grading. In 10 of the remaining 11 patients flow patterns were essentially unchanged; one patient deteriorated further. Four of these 11 patients improved on postoperative clinical or neuropsychological testing. Thus, a positive correlation was found between the changes in CBF and the reduction of the ventricular size on the CT scan, but changes in CBF as measured by the present technique did not accompany improvement in the functional state in all patients.\r"

Metabolic indices were prospectively evaluated for the first 5 days postinjury in six patients who received steroids and 10 patients who did not. Patients were carefully screened to eliminate those with associated injuries as well as those with abnormalities due to sepsis. Other than steroid administration, a uniform treatment regimen was used in both groups. Metabolic indices measured on postinjury Days 1, 3, and 5 were analyzed. In addition, data were compared to results in large data banks obtained both from overnight-fasted patients (fasted controls) and from polytrauma victims (stressed controls). Both treatment groups were comparable with respect to age, mean Glasgow Coma Scale scores on admission and on Day 5, and initial intracranial pressure. Metabolic data indicated significantly higher levels of nitrogen excretion and somatic protein mobilization in steroid-treated patients than in patients not receiving steroids. In both groups, glucose levels, the lactate/pyruvate ratio, and branched-chain amino acid levels (all metabolic indices that correlate well with level of stress) initially corresponded to values for stressed controls. By Day 5, values for these variables were similar to fasted controls for the group not receiving steroids. In patients receiving steroids, however, the data remained similar to those for stressed controls. It is concluded that steroids prolong the metabolic abnormalities associated with the initial phase of head injury. In view of inconclusive data regarding benefit from steroid administration, serious questions must be raised regarding the use of these catabolic agents in this setting.\r"

Of the 283 patients, 14 deteriorated neurologically during acute hospital management. In 12 of the 14, the decline in neurological function could be associated with a specific management event, and in nine of these 12 the injury involved the cervical cord. Nine of the 14 patients who deteriorated had cervical injuries, three had thoracic cord injuries, and two had thoracolumbar junction injuries. Management intervention was identified as the cause of deterioration in four of 134 patients undergoing operative intervention, in three of 60 with skeletal traction application, in two of 68 with halo vest application, in two of 56 undergoing Stryker frame rotation, and in one of 57 undergoing rotobed rotation. Early surgery on the cervical spine when cord injury is present appears hazardous, since each of the three patients with a cervical cord injury who deteriorated was operated on within the first 5 days. No such deterioration was observed following surgery performed from the 6th day on. In two other patients, deterioration did not appear to be related to management but was a direct product of the underlying disease or of systemic complications. Deterioration following hospitalization for spinal cord injury is relatively uncommon--4.9% in this large series. In most instances, decline in function could be attributed to specific management procedures. These changes must not be interpreted as representing failure to provide optimal care but rather should be seen as the inevitable product of an attempt to manage patients with spinal cord and column injuries, many of which are clearly unstable.\r"

  ".W": "Several investigators have detected progesterone receptors in a high percentage of meningioma specimens and have noted progesterone receptors to be more common than estrogen receptors in these specimens. However, a functional significance of such hormone receptor positivity in control of meningioma growth has not been described. This paper describes a paired test of the estrogen and progesterone receptor assay as the biochemical assay and of the human tumor stem-cell clonogenic assay (HTSCCA) as the functional assay in 17 meningioma specimens. Only one (6%) of the 17 specimens was estrogen receptor-positive, while 11 (69%) of 16 specimens were progesterone receptor-positive. The HTSCCA revealed that only two (15%) of 13 specimens were sensitive to estradiol while five (31%) of 16 specimens were sensitive to progesterone. Comparison of progesterone results for the 15 specimens on which both hormone receptor assay and HTSCCA were performed revealed correlation in a majority of cases; four specimens were positive for both assays and five specimens were negative for both assays. No specimen that was negative for progesterone receptors was sensitive to progesterone by HTSCCA. These results suggest that the hormone receptor and sensitivity pattern of meningiomas may differ from that of breast cancer, and that progesterone addition or ablation may be a reasonable therapeutic approach for meningiomas.\r"

Forty-eight cases of infants and young children with this diagnosis seen between 1978 and 1985 at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia were reviewed. All patients had a presenting history thought to be suspicious for child abuse, and either retinal hemorrhages with subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhages or a computerized tomography scan showing subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhages with interhemispheric blood. The physical examination and presence of associated trauma were analyzed; autopsy findings for the 13 fatalities were reviewed. All fatal cases had signs of blunt impact to the head, although in more than half of them these findings were noted only at autopsy. All deaths were associated with uncontrollably increased intracranial pressure. Models of 1-month-old infants with various neck and skull parameters were instrumented with accelerometers and shaken and impacted against padded or unpadded surfaces. Angular accelerations for shakes were smaller than those for impacts by a factor of 50. All shakes fell below injury thresholds established for subhuman primates scaled for the same brain mass, while impacts spanned concussion, subdural hematoma, and diffuse axonal injury ranges. It was concluded that severe head injuries commonly diagnosed as shaking injuries require impact to occur and that shaking alone in an otherwise normal baby is unlikely to cause the shaken baby syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of complete clot removal 24 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the prevention of chronic cerebral vasospasm was evaluated in monkeys in a blind randomized controlled trial. Twenty-four monkeys were randomized to one of three groups to undergo sham-operation (sham-operated group), clot placement only (clot group), or clot placement and removal (clot-removal group). By means of standard microsurgical techniques, the major cerebral vessels bilaterally were dissected free of arachnoid. An autologous hematoma averaging 5 gm was placed around the vessels in the subarachnoid spaces in the clot and clot-removal groups. Saline solution was instilled in the subarachnoid spaces of the sham-operated group. All animals underwent reoperation 24 hours after the first procedure. In the clot-removal group, the hematoma was evacuated. In the sham-operated and clot groups, the incision was simply closed again after 3 hours of anesthesia. Indices monitored before and 7 days after SAH induction included neurological status, angiographic cerebral vessel caliber, and arterial blood pressure. All animals were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); representative animals were evaluated with computerized tomography (CT) brain scans. There were no neurological deficits in either the sham-operated or the clot-removal groups. One animal in the clot group developed a progressive delayed ischemic deficit on Day 5 after SAH. A second animal in this group died suddenly on Day 4 post-SAH. An autopsy revealed a recent infarct in the territory of the superior cerebellar artery. Clinical findings correlated with MRI and CT images. Significant vasospasm (25% to 100% reduction in vessel caliber) was present on Day 7 in 100% of the clot animals (p less than 0.01). There was no significant vasospasm (p greater than 0.05) on Day 7 in either the sham-operated or the clot-removal groups. A large volume of clot placed bilaterally resulted in a 25% incidence of delayed ischemic deficit. Evacuation of subarachnoid hematoma within 24 hours of SAH prevented the development of chronic vasospasm and delayed ischemic deficit in the primate model.\r"

  ".U": "87140275\r", 
  ".W": "The normal rat spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) has been shown to increase after administration of nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker. The present study investigates the capability of nimodipine to improve SCBF, as measured by the hydrogen clearance technique, after a 53.0-gm clip compression injury to the T-1 segment of the rat spinal cord. The profound drop in mean systemic arterial blood pressure (MSAP) after cervical cord injury precluded any improvement in posttraumatic SCBF by nimodipine alone. Hence, in a randomized controlled study with five rats per group, pressor agents (whole blood, angiotensin, or adrenaline) were infused to maintain MSAP between 100 and 120 mm Hg after injury. Control animals received only a saline infusion. Nimodipine at the optimal dose found in normal animals (1.5 microgram/kg/min) was added to the pressor agents. The MSAP and other physiological parameters were measured in rats receiving the pressor agents only and in those receiving pressor agents combined with nimodipine. In rats receiving whole blood, angiotensin, or adrenaline the posttraumatic MSAP improved to between 100 and 120 mm Hg, but there was no improvement in SCBF compared to the saline group. The addition of nimodipine decreased MSAP and SCBF in all groups except those animals also receiving adrenaline, where the MSAP was maintained at 109 +/- 5 mm Hg. In these animals a significant increase in posttraumatic SCBF from 16.5 +/- 2.1 to 20.2 +/- 2.3 ml/100 gm/min (mean +/- standard error of the mean) occurred at the site of injury with the addition of nimodipine. The maintenance of an adequate MSAP by a pressor agent was crucial for nimodipine to improve posttraumatic SCBF by its ability to dilate the spinal vascular bed. Adrenaline was the only pressor agent that could fulfill the above criteria, although other pressor agents need to be investigated. Experiments are underway with the combination of adrenaline and nimodipine to further verify these encouraging results demonstrating an improvement in posttraumatic ischemia of the spinal cord.\r"

Samples were taken 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 4 hours, and 6 weeks after injury. Utilization ratios (metabolite/transmitter) were calculated from the data. Turnover rates for NE and DA were also calculated at 30 minutes using the alpha-methylparatyrosine method. Trauma resulted in rapid and sustained elevations in 5-HT concentration at and around the injury site. The catecholamines were depleted slightly at the injury site. Levels of 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid were elevated at 30 minutes but fell to baseline by 4 hours, resulting in a decrease in the 5-HT utilization ratio. The utilization and turnover of NE was increased at the injury site, while DA function was not affected. The large short-term increase in 5-HT levels may have been due to extravasation of platelet 5-HT stores into spinal tissue, rather than due to changes in neuronal 5-HT metabolism. At 6 weeks after injury, each monoamine and metabolite appeared to accumulate in spinal cord tissue proximal to the insult. Distal to the injury, depleted amine stores displayed augmented utilization. The data are discussed in terms of a serotonergic hypothesis of the progression of neural damage after trauma, with the interaction of 5-HT with raphe-spinal nerve terminals as a principal event.\r"

On the ventral surface of the spinal cord, the anterior spinal artery and the anterior spinal vein ran parallel along the anterior median fissure. Many central arteries branching from the anterior spinal artery coursed in a wavelike manner in the anterior median fissure. The number of central arteries was lowest in the thoracic spinal cord. Central arteries at some spinal cord levels revealed well-developed anastomoses with other central arteries in the anterior median fissure. These well-developed anastomotic central arteries were frequently observed in the thoracic spinal cord, in which the number of central arteries was lowest. On the dorsal surface of the spinal cord, the posterior spinal vein ran longitudinally at the midline and was drained by circumferential veins and posterior central veins. This vein formed a characteristic anastomotic plexus. Small arterioles (20 microns in diameter) in the spinal parenchyma revealed a ring-like compression at the branching site.\r"

None of these patients had any scintigraphic evidence of pheochromocytoma at the time of study or on subsequent clinical follow-up. A quantitative approach was taken to calculate the adrenal medullary uptake of [123I]MIBG in these patients. Three different methods of quantitation were evaluated using data acquired from an anthropomorphic phantom and analysed by three independent observers. In the patient studies 34 out of 35 adrenal medullas were visualized with uptake in the range of 0.01-0.22% of the administered dose 22 hr postinjection which was calculated using the preferred quantitation method. This is an appropriate control group range for comparison with patients who have proven norepinephrine and epinephrine secreting tumors. A quantitative approach to [123I]MIBG imaging provides an important tool for studying adrenomedullary pathophysiology.\r"

This uptake was independent of the pH of the injected solution. Accumulation in these organs suggests a potential role for [Mn]DTPA as a paramagnetic contrast agent for NMR imaging. With the exception of the kidneys, [153Gd]DTPA showed no evidence of tissue specific uptake over the course of 4 hr, consistent with it being an extracellular ion that is cleared by glomerular filtration.\r"

The [123I]HIPDM can be prepared by a simple aqueous exchange reaction in a kit form. We synthesized unlabeled HIPDM by condensation of 2-hydroxy-3-methyl-5-iodobezaldehyde and N,N,N'-trimethyl-1,3-propanediamine, followed by a sodium borohydride reduction reaction. The kinetics of the radioactive iodine exchange reaction for the preparation of [123I]HIDM is controlled by the pH, the temperature, and the presence of reductant (sodium bisulfite), and oxidant (sodium iodate). The reaction is a second order iodine-iodine exchange with an activation energy of 30.6 kcal/mole. The mechanism of this reaction probably involves the formation of an active 1+ or iodine free radical, which is sensitive to the presence of a reductant, such as sodium bisulfite.\r"

This is analogous to previously published SPS techniques of effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) in adults and children and GFR SPS techniques in adults. As a reference standard, GFR has been calculated from compartment analysis of injected radiopharmaceuticals (Sapirstein Method). Theoretical volumes of distribution were calculated at various times after injection (Vt) by dividing the total injected counts (I) by the plasma concentration (Ct) expressed in liters, determined by counting an aliquot of plasma in a well type scintillation counter. Errors of predicting GFR from the various Vt values were determined as the standard error of estimate (Sy.x) in ml/min. They were found to be relatively high early after injection and to fall to a nadir of 3.9 ml/min at 91 min. The Sy.x Vt relationship was examined in linear, quadratic, and exponential form, but the simpler linear relationship was found to yield the lowest error. Other data calculated from the compartment analysis of the reference plasma disappearance curves are presented, but at this time have apparently little clinical relevance.\r"

  ".W": "A previously described mathematical model that simulates the metabolism of absorbed nutrients was used to examine factors influencing the efficiency of utilization of acetate in a sheep weighing 25 kg. A significant component of the model was a function representing substrate cycles that degraded ATP when its concentration reached twice initial levels. Acetate utilization was simulated when up to 2 g mol/d were added to four diets (representing forages and concentrates) that supplied varying proportions of absorbed volatile fatty acids, glucose and protein. The basal diets provided either 4.375 (near energy balance) or 8.75 MJ/d absorbed energy. The predicted net efficiency of utilization (kf) of the energy in added acetate was high (0.58-0.70) for all combinations of absorbed nutrients at the low level of energy absorption, whereas at the higher level, it ranged from 0.16 (forage) to 0.49 (high protein concentrate). Low kf values were always associated with a considerable flux of ATP through the degradation pathway. The increase in ATP concentration that caused this pathway to operate was linked to an inhibition in the utilization of acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis and an increase in its oxidation. The simulated addition of exogenous NADPH or its precursors (particularly glucose and propionate) to these diets repartitioned acetyl-CoA flux towards fatty acid synthesis instead of oxidation, decreased the flux of ATP through the degradation pathway and increased the kf of added acetate. Although a negative relationship was predicted between kf of added acetate and NADPH production for diets with increasing protein content, kf still depended on ATP flux through the degradation pathway. Addition of glucose to the high protein diets decreased this flux by decreasing acetyl-CoA oxidation and increasing fatty acid synthesis. The predictions suggest that the efficiency of acetate utilization in ruminants may be influenced by NADPH availability when a considerable amount of absorbed energy is derived from acetate. Increased absorption of glucose or propionate enhanced NADPH production, but the major effect on acetate utilization of increasing dietary protein was not through NADPH production.\r"

  ".W": "A previously described mathematical model that simulates the metabolism of absorbed nutrients in a sheep weighing 25 kg was used to examine the effects of altering lipid and amino acid absorption, and the potential of the animal to deposit protein on the efficiency of utilization (kf) of metabolizable energy. The predicted kf of energy from lipid added to several diets ranged from 0.65 to 0.74 and was influenced by both the protein and glucose content of the diet. The highest efficiency occurred when body protein deposition was limited by amino acid absorption. Lower values occurred with high protein diets when the proportion of body energy deposited as fat declined and, with low protein diets, when NADPH supply limited the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA. Predicted kf of energy from amino acid added to several diets ranged from 0.003 to 0.47. Low values occurred when protein synthesis was limited by amino acid absorption; an increase in amino acid supply increased ATP utilization for protein synthesis and substantially reduced fat deposition with little resulting change in energy retention. The higher values occurred when most of the additional amino acid was oxidized. Glucose supply increased the kf of added amino acid primarily by reducing the synthesis of glucose from amino acids. Predicted kf of a whole diet generally declined as the proportion of protein in the diet increased. However, when the balance of absorbed nutrients was such that fat synthesis was limited by the supply of NADPH, kf increased with increasing dietary protein. Predicted kf of a diet also declined when the proportion of body energy deposited as protein increased, except when fat synthesis was limited by the supply of NADPH. The predictions suggest that kf is determined primarily by the energetic efficiency of biochemical reactions for maintenance and growth. However, most kf values less than 0.5 were associated with a flux of more than 1 g mol/d of ATP through the degradation pathway (representing substrate cycles) that occurred when NADPH supply limited the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA.\r"

Cassava is a surprisingly effective source of energy which interferes little or not at all with digestion of added protein and fat in weaning diets.

  ".W": "The impact of maternal starvation in late gestation on development of some enzymatic mechanisms concerned with neurotransmission and polyamine synthesis was studied in fetal rat brain. Between 17 and 20 d, acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase activity increased in fetal brains of fed dams, whereas maternal starvation from day 17 to day 20 resulted in heightened acetylcholinesterase but not choline acetyltransferase activity. Ornithine decarboxylase activity on a per-gram wet-weight basis fell between 17 and 20 d in fetal brain from fed dams. Increasing the duration of maternal starvation resulted in a progressive increase in fetal brain ornithine decarboxylase. Arginine and putrescine levels in the brain were lower in fetuses of starved mothers while spermidine and spermine concentrations were unchanged. Since the Km of ornithine decarboxylase for ornithine was found to vary directly with levels of putrescine in fetal brain, lower concentrations of putrescine and greater ornithine decarboxylase activity in fetal brains from starved mothers suggested that levels of this enzyme may be controlled in part by putrescine. Changes in the maternal nutritional state had no effect on the activity of glutamate decarboxylase in fetal brain, and tissue levels of the product, gamma-aminobutyric acid, were unchanged. Thus changes in ornithine decarboxylase and acetylcholinesterase activity in fetal brain may uniquely reflect biochemical alterations consequent to maternal starvation.\r"

BG response to the test meal was significantly and consistently lower after the first week of consuming bran, with a maximum drop after 3 wk. After 1 wk of bran, when compared with the prebran values, SLI secretion was decreased, and glucagon response was significantly enhanced at 120 and 180 min after the meal. IRI secretion did not change significantly until the third week. After consuming bran for 7 wk, postprandial SLI concentrations returned to prebran values, and glucagon levels were not significantly different from those of the first meal. IRI during the fourth test meal (after 7 wk of bran consumption) was significantly higher than after the third meal (after 3 wk of bran ingestion), at 60 min and at 120 min. BG levels remained low. Chronic bran ingestion was therefore associated with an improved glucose tolerance. Its effects on pancreatic hormones varied with time for each hormone, and somatostatin was the only one to return to the prebran values.\r"

There were large differences in the major serum lipids between the control obese and lean rats. Obese rats were characterized by high levels of the various categories of lipids, especially of triglycerides. Thyroidectomized rats had higher serum concentrations of total lipids and cholesterol than controls in both obese and lean rats. The serum concentration of triglycerides was higher in the thyroidectomized lean rats than in lean controls but lower in their thyroidectomized obese littermates than in obese controls. The T3 treatment resulted in a marked reduction in serum total lipid, cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipid levels in both thyroidectomized and control obese rats. The same treatment given to thyroidectomized and control lean rats also produced a lower concentration in serum total lipid, cholesterol and triglyceride levels but had no significant effect on serum phospholipid levels. The serum concentration of free fatty acid was not significantly affected by T3 administration in either obese or lean rats. Thyroidectomy induced a lower body weight gain in both obese and lean rats. The T3 treatment restored the body weight gain in the thyroidectomized lean rats but not in the thyroidectomized obese rats, although the food intake was increased by T3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Gluconeogenesis from dihydroxyacetone (DHA), glycerol, lactate, pyruvate or alanine was studied in the absence or in the presence of glucagon in hepatocytes isolated from starved rats or from rats fed a high protein diet for 2-48 h. In both groups, gluconeogenesis from DHA, glycerol, lactate and pyruvate exhibited similar changes over 48 h; the rates of glucose production increased progressively until 24 h and then plateaued. During the early phase (2-11 h), gluconeogenesis from DHA and glycerol were higher than gluconeogenesis from lactate and pyruvate. During the first 24 h of the experiment, gluconeogenesis from alanine displays a kinetic similar to that from lactate or pyruvate. After feeding a high protein diet for 24 to 48 h, gluconeogenesis from alanine was slightly higher than that in starved rats and paralleled the increase in alanine aminotransferase activity. Glucagon stimulated gluconeogenesis from DHA up to 48 h, but with glycerol this effect occurred only during the early phase (2-11 h). Glucagon stimulated gluconeogenesis from lactate, pyruvate or alanine by 1.35-fold throughout the experimental period. These findings suggest that the development of gluconeogenesis during starvation or after feeding a high protein diet displays different kinetics, depending on the substrate used and on the level of entry in the gluconeogenic pathway: triose phosphates or pyruvate.\r"

Two experiments were done. There were four groups of C57BL/6 female mice in experiment 1: the iron-deficient (ID), pair-fed (PF), control (C) and the high iron (HI) groups. In experiment 2, there were three ID groups (severe to moderate anemia), three PF, one C and four ID groups that were fed adequate iron for 14 (R-14), 7 (R-7), 3 (R-3) days before or on the day of PVP injection (R-0). The overall rate of PVP clearance from blood was lower in ID than in C or PF groups. This clearance is expressed by a constant, K, calculated from natural log (ln) of the cpm and the time postadministration of PVP that blood was drawn. The theoretical individual macrophages function (alpha PVP), derived from K and the weights of body, spleen and liver, was also lower in ID than in C or PF groups. The impairment was most severe with the most severe iron deficiency. Repletion for 7 to 15 d before PVP administration resulted in a partial correction of the clearance. Moderate undernutrition in the PF group had no effect.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier studies have demonstrated that zinc deprivation, when begun in young NZB mice, can retard the development of autoimmunity and result in an increased life span. The present study evaluated the possible benefits of zinc deprivation in NZB mice with established disease, as this model is more relevant to the human patient. Female NZB mice aged 6-8 mo were fed diets containing either 80 micrograms Zn/g and 10 micrograms Cu/g (control) or 1 microgram Zn/g and 10 micrograms Cu/g (zinc-deficient) for 4 mo. In addition, another group was fed a diet containing 1 microgram Zn/g and 100 micrograms Cu/g to determine whether zinc deficiency could be exacerbated by high dietary copper through a competition of copper with zinc at the intestinal level (zinc deficient + high copper). A fourth group of mice was fed the control diet at the same intake as that of the zinc-deficient group in order to control for the inanition associated with zinc deficiency (restricted intake). Regardless of dietary treatment, all mice developed antierythrocyte antibodies at the same rate. At the end of 4 mo, 82% of the control and the restricted-intake groups had survived, whereas the zinc-deficient group had a 38% survival rate and the zinc-deficient + high copper group had a 50% survival rate. These observations show that, in contrast to findings with younger NZB mice, zinc deprivation of adult NZB mice with established autoimmunity will not improve survival. Indeed, severe zinc deficiency increased the mortality rate, demonstrating the need to consider the potential hazards of dietary extremes.\r"

Mutant hepatocytes also exhibited a greater level of MT-1 mRNA in both untreated and zinc-treated cultures compared to wild-type. Despite these measures of MT synthesis, untreated lm/lm hepatocytes exhibited twofold-reduced 6-h uptake of 65Zn compared to wild-type, zinc and copper levels in soluble fractions of lm/lm hepatocytes were equivalent to wild-type levels and lm/lm hepatocytes showed increased susceptibility to zinc toxicity as measured by zinc-induced detachment of cells from the culture dishes. These results suggest that the elevated MT synthesis observed in lethal milk mice does not, as previously reported in wild-type hepatocytes (1-3), increase zinc uptake or protect against heavy-metal toxicity (4, 5). Taken together with studies in vivo, our results suggest that an alteration in MT synthesis is probably a secondary affect of the lethal milk mutation.\r"

Using the line of birds derived from the cross, the incidence of the lesion, defined as a spinal curve greater than 20 degrees, was influenced by deficiencies of copper, manganese or vitamin B-6. In the cross, scoliosis was expressed in 40-50% of birds. Vitamin B-6, manganese or copper deficiency, however, caused an increase in expression to 60-75% of birds. In contrast, protein deficiency, mild vitamin A deprivation, pantothenic deficiency, food restriction or calcium deficiency did not influence expression. Also, the addition of zinc (400 micrograms/g) or cadmium (5 micrograms/g) to a commercial nonpurified diet did not influence expression. That vitamin B-6, manganese and copper are dietary factors important to the expression of scoliosis may be related to their roles in the formation of connective tissue components, such as matrix glycoproteins, collagen or proteoglycans. For example, alterations and abnormalities in connective tissue may partly underlie progression of scoliosis and its potential for expression.\r"

Except for the daily fasting there was little effect of fasting on 20-d body weight or gain per feed intake. Fasting increased the percent bone ash in the tibia in all experiments. Fasting had no effect on total calcium, ultrafilterable calcium, dialyzable phosphorus or growth hormone levels in plasma taken from the birds the 18th and 19th day. The hour of the day that the birds were bled had a significant influence on the plasma total calcium, dialyzable phosphorus and growth hormone levels.\r"

After parturition all groups received a diet with calcium adequate for lactation. Jugular blood samples from 21, 14, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 d prepartum through 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 d postpartum were assayed for concentration of parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus. Heifers and cows receiving high calcium diets had higher calcium and lower parathyroid hormone in blood serum before parturition than animals receiving the low calcium diets. Cows, but not heifers, fed high calcium diets exhibited severe hypocalcemia at parturition, remained hypocalcemic for 3 d and had low serum calcitonin. Regardless of dietary group, concentrations of parathyroid hormone and magnesium in serum increased after the first week of lactation. Feed intake during lactation, corrected for metabolic body weight, was similar for both dietary treatments and ages. Milk production per kilogram metabolic body weight was highest during the first week of lactation for cows fed low calcium diets before parturition. There was no correlation between hypocalcemia and loss of calcium in colostrum or milk. Feeding low dietary calcium to cows in the prepartum period was effective in the prevention of severe hypocalcemia at parturition. In contrast, dietary treatment of heifers had no effect on serum calcium concentration at parturition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The dystrophic RCS rat is one of the most important animal models available for investigating retinal degeneration. In addition to the characteristic progressive loss of neural retina the strain is hampered by a high rate of mortality during the first week of life. Death rate during this period is greatly influenced by diet. A 69% reduction in mortality was achieved by supplementing a purified diet with double the amount of AIN-76 vitamin mix. The objective of this study was to identify vitamin(s) in the AIN-76 mix responsible for the enhanced survival. The experiment determined the effect on survival of independently doubling the concentration of each vitamin present in the AIN-76 vitamin mix. This was done by single addition of individual vitamins to a complete purified diet. Survival was determined in litters whose mothers and grandmothers had been provided the supplemented diets as their sole source of food. Supplementation with riboflavin increased mortality by 19%, whereas RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate supplementation reduced the mortality by 73%. The effect of RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate was equivalent to that achieved by supplementation with complete vitamin mix. First-week survival of pups (born alive) rose from 72.3% +/- 11.0 to 92.5% +/- 3.8 when the level of vitamin E was increased from 50 to 100 IU/kg diet.\r"

Close correlation between serum tryptophan, brain tryptophan and 5-hydroxyindoles were observed regardless of diet fed. When a large neutral amino acid (LNAA such as methionine, threonine, leucine or phenylalanine) was added to the control diet, brain 5-hydroxyindole concentration was lower than when the control diet was fed; however, when tryptophan was added, brain 5-hydroxyindole concentration was significantly higher. Lysine supplementation did not affect brain 5-hydroxyindole concentration. Leucine supplementation caused a lower tyrosine concentration in hypothalamus than the control diet, but phenylalanine supplementation caused higher hypothalamus level of tyrosine. There was no correlation between tyrosine and norepinephrine concentrations in hypothalamus (norepinephrine turnover might also be changed by the nutritional state). These observations indicate that the supplementation of an amino acid at two- or fourfold of the requirement to a low protein diet can generate major changes in the concentrations of neurotransmitters in rats.\r"

  ".W": "Microbial organic matter associated with rumen particulate and fluid phases was quantified using 15N as the microbial marker in two rumen fistulated cows fed a 65% alfalfa haylage diet. During two collection periods, feed was removed 1 h after initiation of feeding, and cows were dosed with (15NH4)2SO4. Whole rumen contents were sampled before feeding and at various times up to 12 h after feeding. Fluid microorganisms were those that passed through eight layers of cheesecloth. Particle-associated microorganisms were obtained by chilling squeezed particles prior to seven successive extractions with saline solution. The amount of microorganisms removed from particles ranged from 32.1 to 59.9% as measured by 15N. Organic matter (mg/mL strained rumen fluid equivalent) of fluid and particle-associated microorganisms was respectively: 10.7 and 47.5; 12.5 and 35.5; 12.2 and 30.1; 10.7 and 26.1; 10.9 and 26.7; and 8.9 and 20.6, at 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 11 h after initiation of feeding. These ratios indicated that 70-80% of microbial organic matter in whole rumen contents was associated with the particulate phase and that particle-associated microbial organic matter was greatest soon after feeding. Analysis of 15N in extracted rumen particles indicated that 50-65% of particle nitrogen and 17-27% of particle dry matter was of microbial origin. These results provide evidence that particle-associated microorganisms make up a major proportion of the total microorganisms in ruminal ingesta and that a large proportion of ingesta particle N can be of microbial origin.\r"

They were then fed a high (70 cal%) starch (HST) purified diet for up to 4 wk. Body weights of both age groups were greater in rats fed the LST than in those fed nonpurified diet throughout. The young, but not the middle-aged, group continued this gain while consuming HST. The levels of activity of intestinal disaccharidases of upper (proximal one-third) and lower (middle one-third) jejunum, and pancreatic alpha-amylase were lower in rats fed LST diet in both age groups than in rats fed HST. Similar increases of specific (per protein or DNA) activity were observed in both age groups throughout the first three (disaccharidase) to four (pancreatic alpha-amylase) days of feeding HST. Values of specific activity of the middle-aged group returned to initial levels with continued feeding of HST. In contrast, values in the young group tended to plateau (disaccharidases) or continued to increase (alpha-amylase). Differences in adaptability over 1 mo were most dramatic for alpha-amylase and sucrase, but negligible for lactase.\r"

These effects were observed for both retinol and retinyl esters, measured by high pressure liquid chromatography. By contrast, lung levels of retinol and retinyl esters were significantly higher in rats treated with ethanol, but remained unchanged in rats treated with phenobarbital or butylated hydroxytoluene compared with control animals.\r"

Despite the initial deficiency, by 3 d of age suckling lm/lm pups exhibited higher levels of hepatic zinc than did lm/lm-nursed wild-type pups. Intestinal zinc and copper concentrations were normal in 1-d-old lm/lm pups, but by 3 d of age were also higher in lm/lm pups than in wild-type pups foster-nursed on lm/lm dams. Contrary to a previous report, we found that zinc concentration in milk of lm/lm dams was not significantly different from those of controls, between 4-20 d postpartum. Mutant milk showed normal zinc distribution as determined by gel-filtration chromatography or by DEAE-cellulose chromatography of zinc-binding ligands derived from EDTA-dissociated micelles, normal copper levels, normal amounts of citrate, a zinc (II) and copper (II)-binding ligand and normal amounts of glutamate, a proposed copper (II)-binding ligand. Total mammary glands and mammary gland cytosols from lm/lm mice exhibited normal zinc concentrations. Copper levels, however, were higher in lm/lm mammary gland cytosols than in controls. These results suggest that an increased uptake and/or retention of zinc and copper in the tissues studied may underlie the signs of zinc deficiency seen in lethal milk mutant mice.\r"

The rats were killed by decapitation while anesthetized with ether, and tissues were assayed for glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and selenocysteine lyase activities, and for Se content. Dietary Se had no effect upon the activity of tissue selenocysteine lyase. This activity was highest in the liver, followed by kidney, muscle and testis in decreasing order. Although the GPx activity was lower in tissues of the Se-deficient rats, there were no significant differences in its activity between animals given the different chemical forms of dietary Se. Except for the kidney, the tissue Se concentrations were similar in rats fed selenite or SeCys, but the Se content in testis, muscle, pancreas, heart, spleen, whole blood, erythrocytes and plasma was significantly higher in rats fed SeMet than in those fed either selenite or SeCys. The greatest increase due to SeMet compared with the selenite and SeCys treatments was about 10-fold in the muscle compared with 1.3- to 3.6-fold for the other tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Selenium deficiency has several known biochemical effects. In the rat, these effects include loss of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, increased plasma glutathione concentration and increased liver glutathione S-transferase (GSH S-Tr) activity. The time course of the development of these changes in rats fed selenium-deficient diets and the time course of reversal of these changes in selenium-deficient rats fed graded levels of selenium were determined. As selenium deficiency was produced, liver cytosolic and plasma GSH-Px activities decreased first and were less than 5% of control when plasma glutathione concentration and liver GSH S-Tr activity began to increase. Elevated liver GSH S-Tr activity in selenium-deficient rats was corrected by refeeding selenium at the lowest level of supplementation (0.015 ppm) for 4 wk. GSH-Px activity required a supplementation of 0.10 ppm selenium for correction to control levels in 4 wk. Based on these studies a classification of the severity of selenium deficiency into mild, moderate and severe categories is proposed. In addition, the effect of dietary sulfur amino acid supplementation on plasma glutathione concentration was studied.\r"

They considered themselves to have benefited by their MDMA experience, with no evidence of harm. There were moderate, consistent biochemical, cardiovascular and neurobehavioral changes within normal limits that peaked between one and two hours following ingestion, returning to predrug levels within 24 hours. This experimental situation produced no observed or reported psychological or physiological damage, either during the 24-hour study period or during the three-month follow-up period. While the subjects are not typical of the general population, the findings support the general impression among knowledgeable professionals that MDMA is reasonably safe, produces positive mood changes in users, does not cause negative problems (if used sparingly and episodically) and is without evidence of abuse. Certainly, any drug that causes ataxia, elevates blood pressure and pulse is potentially unsafe. One can say little about safety when effects and side effects are studied for only 24 hours and then a blood cytology is obtained after three months. In this study, safety must exclude long-term toxicity. Not enough is known about MDMA's long-range effects other than information from random anecdotal evidence supplied by a few clinicians plus self-reports by unselected and unsupervised users. From the information presented here, one can only say that MDMA, at the doses tested, has remarkably consistent and predictable psychological effects that are transient and free of clinically apparent major toxicity. The experimental subjects believed that MDMA is both safe and beneficial, but there is insufficient evidence to accurately judge either the drug's potential harm or benefit.\r"

Growth rate was subnormal in all. Mean 24-hour GH concentration ranged from 1.2 to 7.7 ng/mL, and was significantly greater in pubertal than in prepubertal children (P less than 0.01). In both groups, GH concentration during sleep was significantly greater than during wakeful hours (P less than 0.0005); 24-hour GH concentration correlated significantly with sleep-induced GH peak. A decrease in 24-hour GH concentration and sleep-induced GH peak were noted in four pubertal children with stimulated GH less than 15 ng/mL. A progressive and significant increase in somatomedin C (SmC) level was noted with increasing age and sexual development. No correlations were found between 24-hour GH concentration and rate of growth, age, or bone age. Serum SmC values correlated significantly with age and bone age (P less than 0.01), and with 24-hour GH concentration only in prepubertal children (P less than 0.05). A strong correlation between SmC and growth rate was noted only in pubertal children (P less than 0.01). Growth velocity increased significantly during GH therapy regardless of the 24-hour GH concentration. Our results indicate that in children with growth retardation there is a wide variation in 24-hour GH concentration and a significant increase in GH concentration during puberty; the GH concentration during nocturnal sleep, rather than an entire 24-hour GH concentration, can be used for evaluation; during puberty the SmC level reflects sexual development more than GH reserve; and GH therapy appears to increase growth velocity in both non-GH-deficient and partially GH-deficient short children.\r"

Girls with central precocious puberty had significantly greater mean 24-hour levels of growth hormone in comparison with normal prepubertal girls (5.1 +/- 0.5 SEM vs 3.4 +/- 0.3 ng/mL, P less than 0.005). Mean 24-hour growth hormone levels did not differ significantly between boys with central precocious puberty and normal prepubertal boys (4.4 +/- 1.2 vs 3.0 +/- 0.4 ng/mL). Serum somatomedin C levels were significantly correlated with mean 24-hour growth hormone levels in the girls only. Height age advancement (expressed as height age/chronologic age) was significantly correlated with mean 24-hour growth hormone levels in both boys and girls with central precocious puberty. We conclude that spontaneous 24-hour growth hormone secretion in girls with precocious puberty is greater than that of normal prepubertal girls and may mediate at least in part the increased growth rate in this disorder.\r"

With a thyrotropin binding inhibition immunoglobulin (TBII) assay, TRAb were found in serum from 25 (93%) of 27 patients with untreated, active Graves disease. The TRAb values remained positive in 20 (72%) of 29 patients during the first 6 months of antithyroid therapy and in 13 (54%) of 24 patients during the second 6 months. After discontinuation of antithyroid therapy, 15 patients experienced 18 episodes of relapse of thyrotoxicosis; during relapse TRAb values were positive in all but one patient. Among 19 patients who remained clinically and biochemically euthyroid after cessation of antithyroid therapy, TRAb were not detected in 28 (78%) of 36 serum specimens. Of the eight positive values from six patients, no antiidiotypic antibodies were found, and thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) were not detected in four specimens. The TRAb determination correctly predicted the subsequent clinical course in 26 (72%) of 36 patients. Furthermore, TRAb values and results of triiodothyronine suppression tests were in agreement in 27 of 36 patients, or 75% of the time. TSI were present in serum from only 19 (73%) of 26 patients with active disease; however, TSI were negative in all patients with inactive Graves disease. During the management of Graves disease, TRAb measurements by TBII determinations are valuable in the diagnosis of active disease, assist in the decision to discontinue antithyroid drug therapy, and are useful as the T3 suppression test to predict the clinical course of the disease. The TSI measurement is most useful to determine the activity of the disease when TRAb values are positive in a euthyroid patient.\r"

This systematic approach enables the physician to reach the final diagnosis in a logical way without subjecting the child to unnecessary and possibly hazardous investigations. The algorithm is based on the following measurements as required by each patient: concentrations of blood glucose, lactate, ketone bodies, and glucose-regulating hormones. These measurements are performed with the patient in the fasting state and after loading tests (glycerol and galactose) as needed. If indicated, an enzymatic test is performed to establish the final diagnosis. Eighteen children aged 1 month to 7 years who had persistent or recurrent hypoglycemia have been examined according to this algorithm. The correct diagnosis was arrived at in 17 patients. The diagnosis was not reached in one neonate who had glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency and initially did not have lactic acidosis; once lactic acidosis developed, his illness fitted perfectly into the algorithm.\r"

  ".W": "Four women with classic phenylketonuria (blood phenylalanine greater than 1200 mumol/L) were given a phenylalanine-restricted diet; three also received L-tyrosine supplements. Biochemical measures of nutrition were normal except for iron deficiency anemia, and in one woman folate deficiency. One pregnancy in which treatment began before conception and another treated from 8 weeks gestation, both with blood phenylalanine levels maintained at 120 to 730 mumol/L, resulted in normal newborn infants whose postnatal growth and development have also been normal. A third pregnancy, treated from 6 gestational weeks, was marked by poor dietary compliance until the middle of the second trimester; fetal microcephaly was identified by ultrasonography at 28 weeks but not at 21 weeks. The child has microcephaly and motor delay. The fourth pregnancy, not treated until the third trimester, produced a child with microcephaly, mental retardation, hyperactivity, and neurologic deficits. It is likely that fetal damage from maternal phenylketonuria can be largely and perhaps entirely prevented by dietary therapy, but therapy must begin before conception for the best chance of a normal infant.\r"

  ".W": "We report four patients with Kawasaki disease in whom characteristic coronary artery abnormalities developed after illnesses that did not meet diagnostic criteria. An additional patient lacked a history of acute manifestations of Kawasaki disease, but severe Kawasaki-like arterial changes were noted at autopsy. Fever was present in four of the five patients, in three lasting from 7 to 14 days. Despite manifestation of few classic acute clinical features of Kawasaki disease, three of four patients had desquamation of the fingers and toes 10 to 14 days after onset of illness, and the fifth had desquamation several months prior to death. These patients were seen over a 2-year period during which 22 other children were seen with Kawasaki disease with coronary artery abnormalities. Thus, strict adherence to currently accepted criteria for diagnosis of Kawasaki disease may lead to failure to recognize incomplete forms of this illness, with potential sequelae of myocardial infarction or sudden death. This finding suggests that children with prolonged unexplained febrile illnesses, especially those associated with subsequent peripheral desquamation, should undergo echocardiography 3 to 4 weeks after onset of the illness. This practice would help to identify those patients with illnesses characterized by incomplete diagnostic criteria but in whom significant coronary abnormalities develop.\r"
