TRISS analysis resulted in no statistically significant difference in predicted outcome between any of the four pediatric groups and the adult baseline group. There were only seven misclassified children (0.69%) with respect to survival/death outcome, indicating the usefulness of TRISS to characterize pediatric blunt trauma. In addition, TRISS was used to delineate the injury severity mix of the pediatric population. A TS less than or equal to 14 and ISS greater than 15 was found to serve as a useful definition of severity in this group of injured children.\r"

They suggest competition for leucine for nutritional utilization may be responsible. To test this hypothesis, a branched-chain enriched (46.6%) amino acid mixture (BCAA) was administered on a prospective randomized basis with standard TPN therapy to 16 septic post-trauma patients. After sepsis was diagnosed, a randomized therapy (control-TPN or BCAA-TPN) was given for 12 days, or until death occurred. Total calories and amino acid nitrogen (N) administered were not different in the two groups (t-test) and q 8 h (347 study periods) amino acid clearances, urinary urea nitrogen excretion, muscle proteolysis from 3-methyl-histidine (3-MH) excretion, and standard indices of sepsis severity and hepatic function were measured, as well as platelets (PLAT), leucocytes (WBC), albumin (ALB), and six acute-phase proteins: C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1TRIP), fibrinogen (FIBRIN), alpha-2-macroglobulin (AMACRO), ceruloplasmin (CERUL), and transferrin (TRANS). Using Scheffe analysis of all contrasts the data showed: BCAA resulted in a fall in 24-hour urea N excretion (24.0 to 20.0 gm/24 hr) and in proteolysis (138 to 126 gm/24 hr) (p less than 0.0001). Prestudy CRP levels were all elevated, but compared to control where APP reprioritization occurred, over the initial 10 days of therapy BCAA patients had a more rapid fall in CRP with a more rapid rise in FIBRIN, TRANS, CERUL, ALBUMIN, AMACRO, and A1TRIP (all p less than 0.0001) relative to CRP. Also, the sepsis-reduced clearances of glutamine and glutamate, alanine, and proline were increased (p less than 0.0001) during BCAA even though urea nitrogen production was reduced (p less than 0.0001). The increase in leucine clearance with BCAA-enriched TPN was positively correlated (r2 = 0.601; p less than 0.0001) with the increase in the sum of all APP and ALB and was also associated with an increase both in FIBRIN and in platelets (p less than 0.0001). The BCAA-related increase in FIBRIN (9.1 to 11.9 mg/ml) occurred at the same time as a fall in prothrombin time (p less than 0.0001). BCAA-enriched TPN reduced proteolysis and amino acid catabolism and appeared to increase the levels of the more rapidly appearing anti-inflammatory and nutritional hepatic APP and formed coagulation elements in post-traumatic sepsis.\r"

Tissue PG levels were analyzed by radiochromatographic analysis of microsomal membrane fractions prepared from the ileum in each group. Total cyclooxygenase activity in the normal and control groups was modest, with low levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGE2, PGF2 alpha, thromboxane B2, PGA2, and PGD2 being produced. Hemorrhage, reperfusion, and maintenance on hyperalimentation for 5 days markedly induced total cyclooxygenase activity in the female rat ileum. Ileal microsomal membrane fractions obtained from the mild hemorrhage group synthesized levels of individual PGs three- to seven-fold higher than the normal or control groups, with 6-keto- PGF1 alpha (breakdown product of prostacyclin), PGE2, and PGA2 demonstrating the highest levels of biosynthesis. These data suggest that the gastrointestinal tract could serve as a source for the elevated PGs known to occur in various shock models.\r"

The purpose was to study the clinical significance of the ectopic bone and identify etiologic factors of bone formation. This group consisted of 59 patients with 60 locked intramedullary nails who were reviewed after prospective clinical and radiologic followup. Ectopic bone around the proximal end of the nail was classified with respect to quantity and clinical importance. A number of parameters were evaluated and a multifactorial analysis was performed. There were 52 males and seven females. Heterotopic bone was graded as: none--32%; minimal--20%, mild--28%; moderate--15%; and severe--5%. There was a positive correlation between bone formation and head injury, Injury Severity Score, and ventilator and ICU days. Prominence of the nail was not significant.\r"

During the period of study, 636 additional trauma patients under the age of 65 were admitted. For all trauma victims, hospital costs exceeded projected reimbursement by $2.55 million ($98,000 per month). In the elderly population, mean hospital costs dramatically exceeded mean projected reimbursement in patients over the age of 80 ($18,197 +/- 3,682 vs. $7,069 +/- 700; p less than 0.001), in patients with severe overall injury ($18,992 +/- 3,540 vs. $8,508 +/- 643; p less than 0.001), and in patients with more than one complication ($25,504 +/- 3,959 vs. $7,247 +/- 626; p less than 0.001). Hospital costs were also increased in elderly patients discharged to a nursing home ($22,811 +/- 3,664) primarily as a result of prolonged hospital stay in older patients with more severe injury and with more frequent complications. The daily cost for trauma care in elderly patients who died was a staggering $1,735 +/- 366, reflecting the aggressive care given these patients. In the elderly trauma population, the number of complications was the only factor that correlated with hospital costs (r = 0.63; p less than 0.001). There was no significant correlation between hospital costs and projected DRG reimbursement, suggesting that the current DRG system is a very poor predictor of actual costs for trauma care in this population. The data suggest that the present DRG system grossly underestimates hospital costs in patients more than 65 years old with severe injury and with complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most of the patients are cared for at Level I trauma centers which may not have a dedicated rehabilitation facility. Long-term rehabilitation, nursing care, and financial support remain difficult areas in the overall management of these injuries. Seventy-one cervical spine fracture patients were admitted to this medical center over a 2-year period. Twenty-two patients had a neurologic injury, 15 quadriplegic patients, and seven with incomplete deficits. Vehicular trauma was the etiology in 14 injuries; gunshot wounds in five; falls in three. Twelve of these 22 patients had associated injuries, including chest and abdominal trauma. Prolonged stays in the intensive care unit were common (avg. = 13.5 days). Bronchoscopy (8/22 patients) and aggressive pulmonary care were constantly needed. Six patients died in the intensive care unit. The average hospital stay of the survivors was 45 days. Three of the 16 surviving patients were ventilator dependent at the time of discharge. Ten patients were discharged to a rehabilitation center, one to a nursing home, and five went home (one on a ventilator). The total hospital charges were $1,250,000. No financial resources were available for five of the 16 surviving patients. Four patients had resources which covered less than 50% of the total charges. Average hospital charges for survivors were $50,370. Maximum reimbursement using all outlier days under DRG 5 would be $12,385. The financial support of initial hospitalization, rehabilitation, and nursing care for these quadriplegic patients is a serious national health care issue.\r"

The absence of adequate objective parameters on which to base the decision for salvage results in delayed amputations in many cases. The present study was undertaken to review the medical and economic impact of delayed versus primary amputations following severe open fractures of the tibia. From January 1980 to August 1986, 263 patients with grade III open tibia fractures were treated at a major trauma center: 43 ultimately had amputations. This group included 38 males and five females with an average age of 31 years (range, 15-73). All patients were taken to the operating suite for consideration of limb salvage procedures including debridement, fasciotomy, revascularization, or rigid fixation. The standard subjective criteria including color, consistency, bleeding, and contractility were used to determine muscle viability at the time of debridement. If substantial muscle mass was found to be nonviable then amputation was considered. Fourteen (32.6%) of the patients had primary amputations. They averaged 22.3 days hospitalization, 1.6 surgical procedures to the involved lower extremity, and $28,964 hospital costs (range, $5,344-$81,282). The 29 patients with delayed amputations had an average of 53.4 days hospitalization, 6.9 surgical procedures, and $53,462 hospital costs (range, $14,574-$102,434). Six (20.7%) of the delayed amputation patients developed sepsis secondary to their involved lower extremity and died; no patient in the primary amputation group developed sepsis or died.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An animal model (weanling CD-1 rats) was utilized to evaluate these prophylactic measures. One hundred sixty rats underwent splenectomy and were divided into four treatment groups: I) sham vaccination; II) pneumococcal vaccination; III) vaccination and IM penicillin 24 hours after intraperitoneal inoculation of 10(6) Streptococcus pneumoniae type III; IV) vaccination and IM penicillin starting 3 days before IP inoculation. Six days following the bacterial challenge survival rates by group were: I) 5%; II) 25%; III) 100%; IV) 100% (p less than 0.001 by phi 2 likelihood ratio). Mantel- Cox log rank analysis of survival curves yielded significant differences between all groups except III and IV (p less than 0.001). This study in weanling rats supports the use of penicillin in the asplenic host. Daily prophyactic penicillin or penicillin started at the first sign of infection appears to be equally effective. Randomized studies in humans would determine the best regimen.\r"

In vitro dose response studies with adriamycin, mitomycin C and thiotepa showed dose dependent antiproliferative activity over a concentration range of .001 microgram./ml. to 10 microgram./ml. Interferon also exhibited dose dependent inhibition over a dose range of 250 units/ml. to 4000 units/ml. Comparative in vitro antiproliferative studies showed adriamycin to consistently be the most inhibitory cytotoxic drug followed by mitomycin C and thiotepa. Interferon and thiotepa produce similar (35%) inhibition at the highest concentrations studied. In vitro studies assessing the effects of interferon (1000 units/ml.) combined with each cytotoxic drug (0.01 to 1.0 microgram./ml.) were performed. The most effective combination was observed to be interferon and adriamycin. In three of four experiments either additivity or synergism was observed while consistently augmented activity was not observed with interferon combined with either thiotepa or mitomycin C. In vivo studies on MBT-2 tumors implanted intravesically showed no antitumor activity for adriamycin alone, interferon alone or a combination of both. These results show that combination intravesical therapy with interferon and adriamycin is not an effective treatment regimen in the mouse model when administered as described in this report. These data further suggest that combinations of interferon and cytotoxic drugs may not provide improved response rates in patients treated for superficial bladder tumors.\r"

Although these contrast media represent small episodic costs, they may add up to an aggregate expenditure of nearly $1 billion per year if used for all contrast injections. As a result, this technology raises a number of important medical, economic, legal, and public policy questions. Our cost-effectiveness analysis and an analysis of the medical evidence suggest that LOCM should be limited to high-risk patients. We discuss in this article how the legal system might respond to such limitations, and we consider various public policy options for adopting restrictions on use. We conclude that the medical profession should take the lead in developing protocols for appropriate assessment, reimbursement, and use of LOCM.\r"

At the time of admission to the intensive care unit, the house staff and nurse responsible for each patient were asked to estimate the patient's hospital mortality risk. The patient's APACHE II score was calculated and a prediction of the patient's hospital mortality risk was then computed on the basis of this score. A total of 366 patients were studied. Mortality predictions were obtained from 57 physicians and 33 critical care nurses. We were unable to demonstrate a significant difference in the accuracy of APACHE II predictions compared with either physicians' or nurses' predictions.

This study of all cardiothoracic surgical patients (N = 1825) treated during a 2-year period at an academic medical center demonstrated that patients within cardiothoracic diagnostic related groups could be stratified as to resource consumption (i.e., hospital cost) by four clinical variables: intensive care unit or emergency admission and blood and plasma product utilization. Patients within each diagnostic related group with the variable had higher hospital costs as follows: intensive care unit (100% of patients had higher costs per diagnostic related group for intensive care unit versus non-intensive care unit admissions), blood (100% of patients), plasma product (100%), and emergency admission (92.2%). In addition, hospital costs increased as the factors accumulated. This study demonstrates that costs within cardiothoracic diagnostic related groups may be grouped by four clinical parameters that occur during the patient's hospital stay. One of these variables (i.e., emergency admission) may be suitable to modify diagnostic related group payment. The other variables could segment higher cost patients within a diagnostic related group; cost containment efforts directed at these patients might then provide savings for the hospital.\r"

Twenty-four nonobese and 18 moderately obese adults underwent body potassium (40K) counting, as well as tritiated water space measurement and indirect calorimetry. LBM values predicted from 40K counting and tritiated water space measurements were highly correlated (P = 0.001; r = 0.88). Resting energy expenditure was closely related to LBM (P less than 0.0001; r = 0.78): kcal/day = 622 kcal + (LBM.20.0 kcal/kg LBM). In this relationship, the obese subjects did not differ from nonobese subjects. In summary, the Mayo whole-body counter can accurately measure LBM, and moderate obesity has no detectable effect on corrected resting energy expenditure.\r"

It is important for clinicians to be able to distinguish these organic disorders from primary idiopathic mania (bipolar disorder). The cardinal symptom of organic mania is an abnormally and persistently elevated or irritable mood. Organic mania usually develops in patients who are older than 35 years of age, whereas bipolar disorder generally has its onset between late adolescence and age 25 years. In patients with the first episode of mania, the clinician should thoroughly elicit information about current symptoms, recent infections, use of drugs, and past or family history of psychiatric disorders. In addition, a complete medical examination, computed tomography of the head, electroencephalography, and screening for drugs and toxins should be done. Treatment of organic mania includes correcting the underlying disorder when possible.\r"

  ".W": "With a large segment of the adult population now undergoing routine screening tests on a periodic basis, findings such as rouleaux when the complete blood count is performed or an elevated total protein and globulin fraction on serum chemistries often lead to the performance of a serum protein electrophoresis. When a monoclonal gammopathy is confirmed, the clinician is faced with a broad differential diagnosis that includes a variety of distinct malignant plasma cell disorders and lymphoproliferative diseases, as well as the high incidence of MGUS in the otherwise healthy adult population. Other benign causes of secondary monoclonal gammopathy, such as underlying inflammatory or infectious disorders or drug reactions, may add to the diagnostic dilemma in some patients. By following a systematic plan of laboratory evaluation such as that described here, however, and always keeping the patient's clinical status as a primary focus, the clinician should be able to arrive at a diagnosis and formulate a therapeutic plan in most instances. The most common differential diagnosis, that of MGUS versus PCM, still is difficult in some cases, and it is emphasized that careful follow up over time remains the best method at present for differentiating these two conditions. Once the basic laboratory evaluation of monoclonal gammopathy has been completed, further work-up will need to be individualized. In some cases, the preliminary evaluation will reveal a key feature, such as a monoclonal gammopathy that is IgM, which will lead to a rapid diagnosis of WMG and alert the clinician to investigate other nonroutine aspects of the laboratory evaluation, such as a serum viscosity or specific tests of hemostatic function. In other patients, the initial laboratory evaluation of monoclonal gammopathy may lead to other recommendations, such as lymph node biopsy for evaluation of possible lymphoma, or tissue biopsy to confirm the suspicion of amyloidosis. Overall, the evaluation of monoclonal gammopathy remains a challenging one, but one in which the clinician usually is rewarded with a diagnosis that will allow him to make appropriate management plans for his patient.\r"

However, the incidence of stroke was similar--1.1% in the rt-PA group and 1.0% in the placebo group. Subset analysis showed that patients who had a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) at the time of randomisation (17.5% of the whole trial population) had a low case fatality rate (1.6% in those given rt-PA compared with 3.0% in those given placebo). In those with an abnormal ECG at entry, rt-PA was associated with a 24.5% relative reduction in 1 month fatality (95% confidence interval 9-37%).\r"

  ".W": "Studies in animals suggest that the bispiperazinedione ICRF-187 can prevent the development of dose-related doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity. In a randomized trial in 92 women with advanced breast cancer, we compared treatment with fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FDC), given every 21 days, with the same regimen preceded by administration of ICRF-187 (FDC + ICRF-187). Patients were withdrawn from the study when cardiac toxicity developed or the cancer progressed. The mean cumulative dose of doxorubicin tolerated by patients withdrawn from study was 397.2 mg per square meter of body-surface area in the FDC group and 466.3 mg in the FDC + ICRF-187 group (no significant difference). Eleven patients on the FDC + ICRF-187 arm received cumulative doxorubicin doses above 600 mg per square meter, whereas one receiving FDC was able to remain in the study beyond this dose. Antitumor response rates were similar (FDC vs. FDC + ICRF-187, 3 vs. 4 complete responses; 17 vs. 17 partial responses; and 9.3 vs. 10.3 months to disease progression). Although myelosuppression was slightly greater in the FDC + ICRF-187 group, the incidence of fever, infections, alopecia, nausea and vomiting, or death due to toxicity did not differ between the groups. Cardiac toxicity was evaluated by clinical examination, determination of the left ventricular ejection fraction by multigated nuclear scans, and endomyocardial biopsy. In comparisons of the FDC group with the FDC + ICRF-187 group, clinical congestive heart failure was observed in 11 as compared with 2 patients; the mean decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction was 7 vs. 1 percent when the cumulative dose of doxorubicin was 250 to 399 mg per square meter (P = 0.02), 16 vs. 1 percent at 400 to 499 mg (P = 0.001), and 16 vs. 3 percent at 500 to 599 mg (P = 0.003); and the Billingham biopsy score was 2 or more in 5 of 13 patients undergoing biopsy vs. none of 13 (P = 0.03). We conclude that ICRF-187 offers significant protection against cardiac toxicity caused by doxorubicin, without affecting the antitumor effect of doxorubicin or the incidence of noncardiac toxic reactions.\r"

Of the Listeria monocytogenes isolates available for study, 82 percent (86 of 105) were serotype 4b, of which 63 of 86 (73 percent) were the same phage type. A case-control study implicated Mexican-style soft cheese (odds ratio, 5.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 24.8) as the vehicle of infection; a second case-control study showed an association with one brand (Brand A) of Mexican-style soft cheese (odds ratio, 8.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.4 to 26.2). Laboratory study confirmed the presence of L. monocytogenes serogroup 4b of the epidemic phage type in Brand A Mexican-style cheese. In mid-June, all Brand A cheese was recalled and the factory was closed. An investigation of the cheese plant suggested that the cheese was commonly contaminated with unpasteurized milk. We conclude that the epidemic of listeriosis was caused by ingestion of Brand A cheese contaminated by one phage type of L. monocytogenes serotype 4b.\r"

Their amino acid sequences have only 26% similarity, but their biological activities are comparable, with a few exceptions; indeed, both molecules appear to act at the same receptor. As IL-1 release prostaglandins which sensitize nociceptors in man and in experimental animals, we tested IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta in rats for hyperalgesic (nociceptive) activity. Our results show that IL-1 beta given systemically is an extremely potent hyperalgesic agent with a probable peripheral site of action; IL-1 alpha is approximately 3,000 times less active than IL-1 beta. We have delineated the region of IL-1 beta mediating the hyperalgesic effect and developed an analgesic tripeptide analogue of IL-1 beta which antagonizes hyperalgesia evoked by IL-1 beta and by the inflammatory agent carrageenan.\r"

  ".W": "Membrane-bound G proteins carry information from receptors on the outside of cells to effector proteins inside cells. The alpha subunits of these heterotrimeric proteins bind and hydrolyse GTP and control the specificity of interactions with receptor and effector elements. Signalling by G proteins involves a cycle in which the inactive alpha beta gamma-GDP complex dissociates to produce alpha*-GTP, which is capable of activating the effector enzyme or ion channel; the alpha*-GTP complex hydrolyses bound GTP and reassociates with beta gamma to form the inactive complex. We have characterized a mutation that interrupts this GTP-driven cycle in alpha s, the alpha-chain of Gs, the G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase. The mutation converts a glycine to an alanine residue in the presumed GDP-binding domain of alpha s. The location and biochemical consequences of this mutation suggest a common mechanism by which binding of GTP or ATP may induce changes in the conformation of a number of nucleoside triphosphate binding proteins.\r"

  ".W": "A variety of clinical syndromes, including AIDS and neurological disorders, may follow as a consequence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). It is not yet clear, however, to what extent the destruction of lymphocytes and neural cells associated with these conditions is caused by adverse immune responses to HIV-1 or how much is due to cytopathic effects of the virus itself. Here we document the existence of HLA-restricted, HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid of two AIDS patients manifesting neurologic disorders. These cytotoxic T lymphocytes showed dual specificity, recognizing target cells coated with purified HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp 120) or inactivated HIV-1 in the context of HLA antigens. Cytotoxic T-cell clones derived from one of the AIDS patients revealed restriction specificities representing both HLA class I and HLA class II antigens. Considerable phenotypic heterogeneity was observed amongst these clones, some expressing conventional combinations of cytotoxic T-cell surface markers, and others displaying unusual phenotypes. The presence of HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in AIDS patients, and in particular in their cerebrospinal fluid, suggests that these cytotoxic effectors may participate in the lymphoid cell and/or neurologic damage observed in such patients.\r"

  ".W": "The genomic organization of HIV-1 and the family of HIV-2 and SIV viruses is similar. However, there is an open reading frame, orf-x, that is present in HIV-2 and SIV, but not in HIV-1. The extent of protein sequence conservation in orf-x between HIV-2ROD and SIVMAC suggests that this open reading frame encodes a gene that may be important for infectivity or replication. Here, we show that the orf-x products of SIVMAC and HIV-2SBL-6669 are virion-associated and that the introduction of a premature stop codon into orf-x, did not abrogate virus infectivity and replication in vitro. Antibody reactivity to the orf-x product was detected in 35 of 42 HIV-2 positive serum samples and 11 of 52 SIV seropositive monkeys. No such antibodies were detected in HIV-1 positive donors, blood donors seronegative for both HIV-2 and HIV-1, or SIV seronegative monkeys. This suggests that orf-x is dispensable for in vitro replication of SIVMAC and that the orf-x gene product of HIV-2 or its antibody can be used to distinguish HIV-2 from HIV-1 infection.\r"

More than 100 alleles exist in natural populations in the mouse at each of the functional class I and class II alleles, all alleles occurring at frequencies that cannot be explained by recurrent mutations. Some of the alleles differ by approximately 70 nucleotides in the coding region alone and some of the products of the allelic genes differ by more than 50 amino acids. It has generally been assumed that these differences accumulated after species inception. Here, we present evidence for an alternative explanation of the origin of MHC polymorphism: a large part of the MHC polymorphism pre-dates speciation and is passed on from species to species. We describe allelic differences that must have arisen before the separation of mice and rats from a common ancestor more than 10 million years ago.\r"

The patients were able to respond to verbal stimuli during all seizures and, later, could clearly recall ictal events. To determine whether the EEG changes in simple partial seizures could be reliably observed, a reader blindly reviewed four EEGs of equal duration for each seizure. These EEGs consisted of one ictal and three nonictal recordings obtained at predetermined times before the seizure. There were 27 motor seizures (mean duration, 86 seconds; range, 2 to 250 seconds), all involving clonic movements of the head and/or upper extremities; 8 (30%) of these had a sensory component (pain in 6, paresthesia in 2). An EEG change, usually localized spikes or sharp waves over the contralateral or both rolandic regions, was identifiable in nine (33%) of the motor seizures. The 60 nonmotor seizures (mean duration, 63 seconds; range, 8 to 375 seconds) involved a variety of symptoms, including somatosensory/special sensory (3 seizures), autonomic (26 seizures), cognitive (1 seizure), affective (14 seizures), and mixed, or more than one category of nonmotor symptoms (16 seizures). In only nine (15%) of the nonmotor seizures was there an ictal EEG change, usually localized spikes or paroxysmal theta activity over the temporal region. Overall, among the 87 simple partial seizures, only 18 (21%) revealed ictal EEG changes. Thus, a normal EEG is common during simple partial seizures and does not exclude the diagnosis.\r"

A full-length cDNA clone encoding the monooxygenase cytochrome P-450IIB1 under control of the simian virus 40 early promoter was constructed and cointroduced with the selection marker neomycin phosphotransferase (conferring resistance to G418) into V79 Chinese hamster cells. G418-resistant cells were selected, established as cell lines, and tested for cytochrome P-450IIB1 expression and enzymatic activity. Two cell lines (SD1 and SD3) were found that stably produce cytochrome P-450IIB1. Although purified cytochromes P-450 possess monooxygenase activity only after reconstitution with cytochrome P-450 reductase and phospholipid, the gene product of the construct exhibited this activity. This implies that the gene product is intracellularly localized in a way that allows access to the required components. If compared with V79 cells, the mutation rate for the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus in SD1 cells is markedly increased when exposed to aflatoxin B1, which is activated by this enzyme.\r"

The enzyme consists of a single approximately equal to 35-kDa polypeptide that binds one heme B molecule, one heme A molecule, and two Cu ions. Optical spectra suggest the presence of cytochrome b, cytochrome a3, and CuA in this protein. Quantitative EPR and Mossbauer studies of the oxidized protein indicate the presence of one low-spin ferric heme, which is assigned to cytochrome b. Mossbauer studies of the reduced protein show the presence of one low-spin ferrous heme, assigned to cytochrome b, and a predominant high-spin ferrous heme that reacts quantitatively with CO to yield an additional low-spin ferrous heme. The latter Fe atom is associated with the heme A and is designated cytochrome a3. The EPR spectrum of the oxidized protein also reveals the presence of a CuA-type center that accounts for half the total Cu. The remainder of the Cu would appear to be present as CuB that is magnetically coupled to the heme A. Amino acid analyses of cytochrome ba3 show the presence of eight to nine histidine residues and one cysteine residue.\r"

  ".W": "The thylakoid membrane cytochrome b6-f complex (plastoquinol:oxidized-plastocyanin oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.99.1) catalyzes electron-transfer and proton-translocation reactions essential for oxygenic photosynthesis. We have isolated and determined the nucleotide sequences of the petC and petA genes encoding the Rieske Fe-S and cytochrome f polypeptides from the filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc PCC 7906. These genes occur as single genomic copies, are tightly linked, and, as indicated by hybridization of gene-specific probes to Nostoc RNA, are cotranscribed as a 2.0-kilobase message. The Rieske Fe-S/cytochrome f gene pair thus represents an example of clustering and cotranscription in cyanobacteria of functionally related genes that, in photosynthetic eukaryotes, reside on separate nuclear and plastid genomes. These data are consistent with the progressive degeneration of the modern chloroplast genome from the ancestral, cyanobacterial-like genome of an endosymbiont. The Rieske Fe-S and the mature cytochrome f apoproteins are encoded by 537 and 867 nucleotides and have molecular masses of 19.2 and 31.2 kDa, respectively. They show 59% and 60% protein sequence identity, respectively, relative to spinach. Forty-four amino acids (4.7 kDa) resembling a prokaryotic signal sequence precede apocytochrome f. In contrast, the Rieske Fe-S protein appears to be translated without a presequence. The 183 bases separating the Rieske Fe-S and preapocytochrome f genes contain two families of 7- to 9-base tandem repeats, and some part of this sequence is highly reiterated in the genome. The C terminus of the Rieske Fe-S protein contains cysteine and histidine residues (probable ligands for the Fe2S2 center) in two peptides, Cys-Thr-His-Leu-Gly-Cys-Val and Cys-Pro-Cys-His-Gly-Ser, which have been conserved in spinach and in the five available Rieske Fe-S sequences from the mitochondrial-type cytochrome b-c1 complexes. Cytochrome f shows the heme binding residues Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-His near its N terminus. Single, long hydrophobic stretches occur near the N and C termini, respectively, of the Rieske Fe-S and cytochrome f proteins and may form membrane-spanning helices.\r"

Purified alpha and beta gamma subunits of the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein have each been reported to open the K+ channel. We have reported that nanomolar concentrations of purified brain beta gamma subunits activated IK.ACh in chicken embryonic atrial patches. In contrast, J. Codina, A. Yatani, D. Grenet, A.M. Brown, and L. Birnbaumer [(1987) Science 236, 442-445] subsequently reported that picomolar concentrations of activated erythrocyte alpha subunits (i.e., the 40-kDa alpha subunit that the authors call alpha K) opened K+ channels in guinea pig atrial patches. In this paper, we further explore the specificity of various beta gamma and alpha subunits in embryonic chicken and neonatal rat atrial patches. Beta gamma subunits from either human placenta (beta 35 gamma) or bovine brain (beta 35,36 gamma) activated IK.ACh whereas transducin beta gamma (beta 36 gamma) did not. The beta gamma activation was consistent in rat and chicken patches [118 of 123 patches (97%)]. Beta gamma subunits opened K+ channels at concentrations greater than or equal to 200 pM and maximally activated the channel at 10 nM. Beta gamma or guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma-S]) channel activation could be reversed by alpha 41-GDP. The purified brain beta gamma preparation was contaminated with less than 0.01% unactivated alpha. The detergent (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; CHAPS), used to suspend the hydrophobic beta gamma, did not activate IK.ACh alone, with buffer, with heat-inactivated beta gamma, or with transducin beta gamma. Unactivated alpha subunits did not open K+ channels. Activated, alpha subunits purified from human erythrocytes (alpha 40-GTP[gamma-S]) or bovine brain (alpha 39-GTP[gamma-S]) at concentrations of 10 pM or higher (up to 1 nM) opened K+ channels less frequently in chicken atrial patches [5 of 27 patches (19%) and 9 of 35 patches (26%), respectively] than in rat atrial patches [5 of 11 patches (45%) and 11 of 19 patches (58%), respectively]. Negative results were not due to patch vesicle formation. Other experiments indicated that alpha and beta gamma activated the same population of channels. Activation of the channel by both beta gamma and alpha subunits implies a more complicated scheme for guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein action than previously proposed.\r"

We have identified three such proteins and their binding sites and correlate them with enhancer function. Mutation of nucleotide (nt) 5140 in the enhancer alters the binding site (TGACTAA, nt 5139-5145) for polyomavirus enhancer A binding protein 1 (PEA1), a murine homolog of the human transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP1). This mutation simultaneously reduces polyomavirus transcription and DNA replication. Reversion of this mutation simultaneously restores binding of PEA1 and both DNA replication and transcription. Binding of a second protein, PEA2, adjacent to the PEA1 site at nt 5147-5155 is enhanced by PEA1 binding, suggesting that these proteins interact. A third protein, PEA3, binds to the sequence AGGAAG (nt 5133-5138) adjacent to the PEA1 binding site; integrity of this late-proximal PEA3 binding site or an additional early-proximal site (nt 5228-5233) is important for enhancer function. We correlate binding of PEA1 and PEA2 with the induction of a DNase I-hypersensitive site in polyomavirus minichromosomes isolated from mouse fibroblasts.\r"

In addition, it is less sensitive to interference from nucleases or ligases than previous assays. The assay was used to partially purify an ATP-independent strand-transfer activity from a crude nuclear extract of Drosophila melanogaster embryos. We have also tested the efficiency with which various short double-stranded DNA segments are assembled into plectonemic joints by RecA protein with this assay and found 5- to 10-fold differences.

In this study, 21 tissues from lactating and virgin transgenic female mice containing the WAP-tPA hybrid gene were screened for the distribution of murine WAP and human tPA transcripts. Like the endogenous WAP RNA, WAP-tPA RNA was expressed predominantly in mammary gland tissue and appeared to be inducible by lactation. Whereas WAP transcripts were not detected in 22 tissues of virgin mice, low levels of WAP-tPA RNA, which were not modulated during lactation, were found in tongue, kidney, and sublingual gland. These studies demonstrate that the WAP gene promoter can target the expression of a transgene to the mammary gland and that this expression is inducible during lactation.\r"

Platelets were disrupted by a cycle of freezing and thawing in the presence of a hyposmotic buffer containing protease inhibitors. In both fractions, the A subunit of cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates two proteins with molecular masses of 42 and 44 kDa, whereas pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylates a 41-kDa polypeptide. Two antisera against the alpha subunit of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein recognize only the 42-kDa polypeptide. Cholera toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation of the 42- and 44-kDa proteins is reduced by pretreatment of platelets with iloprost, a prostacyclin analog. The 44-kDa protein, which is substrate of cholera toxin, could be extracted completely from the membrane and recovered in the cytosolic fraction when the cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization and the pellet was extensively washed. A 44-kDa protein can also be labeled with 8-azidoguanosine 5'-[alpha-32P]triphosphate in the cytosol and membranes. These findings indicate that cholera and pertussis toxins produced covalent modifications of proteins present in particulate and cytosolic platelet fractions.

  ".W": "We present evidence that Tn10 transposition, or a closely correlated event, induces expression of bacterial SOS functions. We have found that lambda prophage induction is increased in Escherichia coli lambda lysogens containing increased Tn10 transposase function plus single or multiple copies of an appropriate pair of transposon ends. This increase occurs by the normal pathway for prophage induction, which involves RecA-mediated cleavage of the phage lambda repressor protein. We also present evidence that Tn10 promotes induction of expression of the E. coli sfiA gene. Tn10 transposes by a nonreplicative mechanism. We propose that the signal for RecA protease activation and SOS induction is generated by degradation of the transposon donor molecule and suggest that SOS induction is biologically important in helping a cell undergoing transposition to repair and/or recover from damage to the transposon donor chromosome.\r"

In contrast, the same vector only harboring c-myc or v-Ha-ras was virtually ineffective. RIM-induced plasmacytomas expressed retroviral myc and ras genes while their endogenous c-myc alleles were unrearranged and transcriptionally inactive. These plasmacytomas were clonal as each possessed a unique immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining region rearrangement and a single recombinant provirus. Moloney murine leukemia helper virus did not play an obligatory role in tumorigenesis since insertions of Moloney murine leukemia proviruses were found in only 6 of 24 plasmacytomas induced in adult mice. Taken together, these findings support the view that the v-Ha-ras oncogene can cooperate with an activated myc gene in pristane plasmacytomagenesis.\r"

  ".W": "T lymphocytes are stimulated to proliferate in an autocrine/paracrine manner by the lymphokine interleukin 2 (IL-2). In seeking further insight into the mechanisms by which IL-2 induces progression of T cells through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, studies were performed with agents that increase cellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), a well-known inhibitor of lymphocyte growth. The addition of dibutyryl-cAMP, cholera toxin, forskolin, or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine to an IL-2-dependent murine T-cell line evoked a dose-related suppression of S-phase transition without affecting cellular viability. Moreover, elevation of cAMP levels led to an accumulation of uniformly small cells, suggesting an arrest in early G1. Consistent with these findings, dibutyryl-cAMP inhibited the incorporation of both [3H]-uridine and [3H]thymidine by IL-2-stimulated, synchronized normal human T cells. Furthermore, maximal inhibition occurred during early G1, as indicated by experiments where the addition of dibutyryl-cAMP was delayed with respect to IL-2 stimulation. Quantitative flow cytometric analysis of RNA and DNA content of IL-2-stimulated cells affirmed that increased cAMP inhibits RNA accumulation and S-phase transition. In addition, exposure of IL-2-dependent, asynchronously proliferating normal human T cells to dibutyryl-cAMP resulted in uniform growth arrest in early G1, the point at which cycling T cells accumulate when they are deprived of IL-2. These results indicate that increased cAMP inhibits G1 progression stimulated by IL-2 and provide a rationale for the use of cAMP analogues as pharmacologic probes for the dissection of molecular events occurring during IL-2 signaling and T-cell G1 transit. They also suggest the possibility of therapeutic immunosuppression by a combination of agents that act at different stages of the T-cell cycle.\r"

Combination of recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IFN-gamma resulted in a synergistic enhancement of DR mRNA and protein induction in both cell lines. TNF alone increased the constitutive expression of the DR gene in THP-1 cells. In the HLA class II-negative U937 cells, TNF used alone was not able to induce DR gene expression. Such a negative result was not due to a lack of TNF receptor expression in U937 cells, since TNF clearly induced HLA class I and TNF gene expression in this cell line. THP-1, but not U937, cells secreted TNF under the influence of IFN-gamma. Neutralization of TNF by a specific antibody decreased IFN-gamma-induced DR antigen expression in THP-1 cultures. These observations indicate that TNF is not able to directly induce DR gene expression, but rather amplifies ongoing expression of this gene, whether constitutive or induced by IFN-gamma. In the two cell lines tested, the level of DR inducibility under the influence of IFN-gamma used alone depended on a different inducibility of TNF secretion by IFN-gamma. Altogether, our observations indicate that TNF, whether exogenous or endogenously produced under the influence of IFN-gamma, amplifies DR gene expression in monocytes, a phenomenon that may provide to such antigen-presenting cells a selective sensitivity to the DR-inducing effects of IFN-gamma.\r"

It is widely used as a marker to distinguish peripheral T cells from B cells in mice. We show here that, in five distinct mouse strains, recombinant interleukin 4 (IL-4/B-cell stimulatory factor 1) strikingly induces membrane expression of Thy-1 on the vast majority of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated normal murine B cells. Thy-1+ B cells are precursors for immunoglobulin-secreting cells. RNA blot analysis indicates that B cells express a Thy-1 mRNA of 1.8 kilobases, the same size as that found in T cells. Cell mixing experiments show that only cells derived from Thy-1.2+ donors express Thy-1.2, indicating that B cells expressing Thy-1 have not passively absorbed the glycoprotein from another cell source. Recombinant interferon-gamma inhibits Thy-1 induction by B cells stimulated with LPS and IL-4. Thy-1 is also induced on B cells that have been stimulated as a result of the specific activation of an IL-4-producing T-helper clone. Anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody inhibits the induction of B-cell Thy-1 in this T-cell-B-cell interaction.\r"

A series of deletions of each fragment was constructed and tested by immunoblotting for the binding of alloantibody and autoantibody inhibitors. Analysis of derivatives of the 80-kDa fragment showed that six inhibitors recognized a major epitope(s) within the carboxyl-terminal 17.3 kDa of factor VIII. These inhibitors also recognized weaker epitopes nearby and one inhibitor recognized epitopes scattered throughout the 80-kDa fragment. Deletions within the heavy chain fragment revealed one epitope-containing region confined to the amino-terminal 18.3 kDa recognized by six inhibitors. Bacterially produced factor VIII fragments containing the major epitopes were capable of neutralizing inhibitors in vitro but fragments containing weaker or no epitopes did not. These data suggest a potential therapeutic use of factor VIII fragments for neutralization of inhibitor antibodies.\r"

  ".U": "88320403\r", 
  ".W": "1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a potent dopaminergic neurotoxin that causes biochemical, pharmacological, and pathological deficits in experimental animals similar to those seen in human parkinsonian patients. All of the deficits can be prevented by treating mice with selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), including deprenyl, prior to MPTP administration. We now report that the dopaminergic neurotoxicity of two potent MPTP analogs, namely the 2'-methyl and 2'-ethyl derivatives (2'-MeMPTP and 2'-EtMPTP), cannot be prevented by deprenyl pretreatment. However, the neurotoxicity of these two analogs can be prevented by pretreatment with a combination of deprenyl and the selective MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline at doses that are sufficient to almost completely inhibit both MAO-B and MAO-A activities. Moreover, the neurotoxicity of 2'-EtMPTP (but not of 2'-MeMPTP and MPTP) can be significantly attenuated by clorgyline alone. There was a parallel between the capacity of the MAO inhibitors to decrease the brain content of the pyridinium species after administration of the tetrahydropyridines and the capacity of the MAO inhibitors to protect against the neurotoxic action of the tetrahydropyridines. The data support the conclusion that both 2'-MeMPTP and 2'-EtMPTP are bioactivated to pyridinium species to a significant extent by MAO-A. Further, it appears that the formation of the pyridinium species plays an important role in the neurotoxic process.\r"

  ".W": "The amino acid sequence of the Alzheimer disease amyloid precursor (ADAP) has been deduced from the corresponding cDNA, and hydropathy analysis of the sequence suggests a receptor-like structure with a single transmembrane domain. The putative cytoplasmic domain of ADAP contains potential sites for serine and threonine phosphorylation. In the present study, synthetic peptides derived from this domain were used as model substrates for various purified protein kinases. Protein kinase C rapidly catalyzed the phosphorylation of a peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 645-661 of ADAP [ADAP peptide(645-661)] on Ser-655. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylated ADAP peptide (645-661) on Thr-654 and Ser-655. This peptide was virtually ineffective as a substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, casein kinase II, or insulin receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. When a homogenate of rat cerebral cortex was used as the source of protein kinase, phosphorylation of ADAP peptide(645-661) was stimulated by calcium/phosphatidylserine/diolein to a level 4.6-fold above the basal level of phosphorylation, consistent with a prominent stimulation by protein kinase C. Using rat cerebral cortex synaptosomes prelabeled with 32Pi, a 32P-labeled phosphoprotein of approximately equal to 135 kDa was immunoprecipitated by using antisera prepared against ADAP peptide(597-624), consistent with the possibility that the holoform of ADAP in rat brain is a phosphoprotein. Based on analogy with the effect of phosphorylation by protein kinase C of juxtamembrane residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor and the interleukin 2 receptor, phosphorylation of ADAP may target it for internalization.\r"

Activation reached a maximum level (140% of control value) within 5 min of addition and returned to control levels within 20 min. The effect of insulin was dose-dependent with half-maximal activation occurring at approximately 5 nM insulin. This activity could be completely inhibited by addition of the heat-stable protein inhibitor 2, which suggests the presence of an activated type-1 phosphatase. Similar effects on phosphatase activity were seen when epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor were tested. These results suggest that some of the intracellular effects caused by insulin and growth factors are mediated through the activation of a protein phosphatase.\r"

Sequential wheat germ agglutinin and ligand affinity chromatography of membranes extracted with octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside resulted in at least a 680-fold purification of the receptor, as measured by precipitating it in association with liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine. The purified receptor bound 125I-labeled recombinant mouse interferon gamma (rMuIFN-gamma) with a Kd of 10 nM, a value comparable to that obtained with isolated membranes (3.5 nM). PAGE analysis of radiolabeled (with either 35S or 125I) receptor preparations consistently revealed a major band of 95 kDa. This species was degraded with time to smaller fragments, principally one of 60 +/- 5 kDa. Treatment with peptide:N-glycosidase F reduced the apparent molecular masses of the proteins in the 95- and 60-kDa regions by 15-20 kDa each. GR-20, a monoclonal antibody against the receptor, completely inhibited specific binding of 125I-labeled rMuIFN-gamma to WEHI-3 cells, blocked the induction of priming by rMuIFN-gamma of macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing, removed binding activity for 125I-labeled rMuIFN-gamma from solubilized membranes, and immunoprecipitated a single 95-kDa protein from the extract of surface labeled (125I) WEHI-3 cells. Cross-linking of 125I-labeled rMuIFN-gamma to its receptor yielded a complex of 125 +/- 5 kDa, consistent with the binding of the dimeric form of mouse interferon gamma (32 kDa) to a membrane protein of 95 kDa. These data suggest that the receptor for mouse interferon gamma (or a ligand-binding subunit thereof) is a glycoprotein of 95 kDa.\r"

Half-maximal stimulation occurred at 0.5 pM IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta, and both interleukins were equally effective, with maximal stimulation occurring in response to 5-10 pM IL-1. In contrast to IL-1, bradykinin stimulation of prostaglandin E2 synthesis is rapid; its effect is maximal by 5 min. In cells that had been pretreated with IL-1 for 24 hr, prostaglandin E2 synthesis in response to bradykinin was amplified more than 10-fold. IL-1 also amplified the receptor-mediated formation of prostaglandin E2 by bombesin and thrombin. The lymphokine did not affect bradykinin receptor number or affinity. IL-1 treatment induced phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase but not phospholipase C or prostaglandin E isomerase. It also enhanced bradykinin-stimulated GTPase activity, suggesting possible induction of the GTP-binding regulatory protein coupled to the bradykinin receptor. Thus, IL-1 enhanced receptor-mediated release of prostaglandin E2 in response to bradykinin, bombesin, and thrombin by increasing the cellular levels of phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase, and GTP-binding regulatory protein(s).\r"

IFN-alpha does not induce the myristoylation of the 48-kDa protein, and IFN-beta does so very poorly. Neither IFN-alpha nor IFN-beta has any effect on IFN-gamma-induced myristoylation of the 48-kDa protein. The 48-kDa protein is constitutively myristoylated in murine macrophages that have been activated in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of Corynebacterium parvum, suggesting that it may be an early intermediate in the activation of macrophages.\r"

The tubulin-stimulated reaction exhibits no extra incorporation of water-derived oxygens over a wide range of ATP and tubulin concentrations, indicating that Pi release is faster than the reversal of hydrolysis. ADP release, however, is slow for the basal reaction and its release is rate limiting as indicated by the very tight ADP binding (Ki less than 5 nM), the retention of a stoichiometric level of bound ADP through ion-exchange chromatography and dialysis, and the reversible labeling of a bound ADP by [14C]ATP at the steady-state ATPase rate as shown by centrifuge gel filtration and inaccessibility to pyruvate kinase. Tubulin accelerates the release of the bound ADP consistent with its activation of the net ATPase reaction. The detailed kinetics of ADP release in the presence of tubulin are biphasic indicating apparent heterogeneity with a fraction of the kinesin active sites being unaffected by tubulin.\r"

Insertions and deletions of up to 30 base pairs were made in the nonessential regions between the H1 and H2 protein binding sites. Recombination was found to occur in substrates with changes of integral multiples of a DNA helical repeat, whereas recombination was defective in substrates with nonintegral changes. The lambda recombinogenic complex is especially interesting because two different proteins are involved: integration host factor (IHF), which has been shown to bend DNA, and the phage-encoded integrase protein (Int), which has been shown to have two distinct DNA-binding domains. The importance of angular displacement of protein binding sites was confirmed by addition of ethidium bromide to defective substrates. Significant stimulation of recombination was observed when sufficient drug intercalated and unwound the DNA to allow improved orientation of sites. The orientation effects are dependent on supercoiling, as spacing is less important in conditions where supercoiling and the P1-H1 sites are not required for recombination.\r"

  ".W": "Autophosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II converts the enzyme to a Ca2+-independent form. The time course for this conversion correlates with the autophosphorylation of a threonine residue located within a thermolytic phosphopeptide common to the alpha and beta/beta' subunits. In the present study, this site was identified in the alpha subunit. After autophosphorylation under conditions that produced near-maximal Ca2+-independent activity, the alpha and beta/beta' subunits were separated by NaDodSO4/PAGE, and the alpha subunit was cleaved with cyanogen bromide. The major phosphopeptide (CB-1), containing phosphothreonine as the only radiolabeled amino acid, was purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and subjected to automated gas-phase Edman degradation. The sequence obtained, Xaa-Arg-Gln-Glu-Thr-Val-Asp-Xaa-Leu-Lys-Lys-Phe-Asn-Ala-Arg-Arg-Lys-Leu, represented the NH2-terminal 18 residues (residues 282-299) of a 26-amino acid cyanogen bromide peptide predicted from the deduced primary structure of the alpha subunit and contained a consensus sequence for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II phosphorylation that included Thr-286. The sequences obtained for two phosphopeptides derived from secondary chymotryptic digestion of CB-1 confirmed that Thr-286 was the phosphorylated residue.\r"

Specifically, we have corrected a chromosomal immunoglobulin gene mutation by transferring pSV2neo vectors encoding the constant region of the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain to mutant hybridoma cells that bear a 2-base-pair deletion in the third constant region exon of their chromosomal mu gene. After DNA transfer, we detected G418-resistant transformants that produce normal IgM. Analysis of the DNA structure of the mu gene in these transformants indicates that in four of five cases the mu gene has been restored as a result of the integration of a single copy of the transfer vector by a reciprocal homologous recombination event; the fifth case seems to have resulted from gene conversion or double crossover. These results suggest that this technology might be adapted for mapping immunoglobulin gene mutations by marker rescue and for more convenient engineering of specifically altered immunoglobulin.\r"

One of the mutants analyzed, y76d28, results from the insertion of a P element into the 5'-transcribed, untranslated portion of the y gene. Sequence analysis of several revertants of y76d28 shows that P excision occurs imprecisely. These events result in insertion of additional ATG codons in the y locus mRNA but are without phenotypic effect. In addition, we describe the molecular structure of P-associated mutations induced in a near wild-type revertant of y76d28 that carries an internally deleted 0.4-kilobase P element in the 5' noncoding region. Sequence analysis of two of these mutants demonstrates that they arose as a result of the integration of a larger P element at the exact location as in the parental stock without the 8-base-pair additional duplication associated with P insertions. The phenotype of these y alleles is dependent on the size and orientation of the integrated P element. We infer that P-element replacement in these mutants has occurred by a recombination/gene conversion mechanism.\r"

Anti-Tac was added to an antigen-nonspecific suppressor system in which Con A-induced suppressor T cells were generated during a preculture period, and their effects on immunoglobulin production were assessed in second, indicator cultures containing pokeweed mitogen and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Anti-Tac added during the preculture period inhibited Con A-induced suppressor T-cell generation. Cells activated by a short (2-day) preculture period to become effectors of suppression were primarily of the Tac-positive, T8 (CD8)-positive phenotype. Tac-positive, T8-negative T cells might also contribute to the suppressor activity. Our studies indicate that anti-Tac, by producing a functional blockade of human high-affinity IL-2 receptors, inhibits the generation of antigen-nonspecific suppressor T cells.\r"

In situ hybridization has been used to determine the frequency of cells competent to express the interleukin 2 (IL-2) gene after short-term stimulation with various polyclonal activators. The effects of the T-cell receptor ligands Con A and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody were compared with those of a calcium ionophore that bypasses membrane receptors altogether. Induction with a calcium ionophore and phorbol ester revealed that potential IL-2 producers not only constitute greater than 85% of the cells with a CD4+ \"helper/inducer\" phenotype but also constitute over half of the cells with a CD8+ \"killer/suppressor\" phenotype. There is no defect in the ability of these CD8+ cells to accumulate IL-2 transcripts under these conditions. By contrast, in response to phorbol ester and either Con A or anti-CD3, the CD8+ cells show an abortive IL-2 production response with rapid disappearance of IL-2 mRNA. This results in substantially lower yields of IL-2 per cell than is made by CD4+ cells in response to the same stimuli. The extent to which these populations appear to have diverged in function thus depends on the stimulus used to trigger the response. The results suggest that differences in signal transduction or posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms, rather than effector gene inducibility per se, may initially underlie the commitment of CD4+ and CD8+ cells to distinct functional roles.\r"

  ".W": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) manifests a range of phenotypes in culture that may be important in understanding its relationship to non-SCLCs and to tumor progression events in patients. Most SCLC-derived cell lines, termed \"classic\" SCLC lines, have properties similar to SCLC tumors in patients, including high expression of neuroendocrine markers and low c-myc oncogene expression. A significant number of SCLC lines characterized as \"biochemical or morphologic variant\" SCLC lines have decreased levels of endocrine differentiation markers associated with increased proliferative indices, amplification of the c-myc oncogene, and growth patterns and biochemical markers more typical of non-SCLCs. To delineate further the relationships between these phenotypes and the molecular events involved, we have inserted the v-Ha-ras gene in SCLC cell lines with (biochemical variant) and without (classic) an amplified c-myc gene. These two SCLC subtypes had markedly different phenotypic responses to similar levels of expression of v-Ha-ras RNA. No biochemical or morphologic changes were observed in classic SCLC cells. In contrast, in biochemical variant SCLC cells, v-Ha-ras expression induced features typical of large cell undifferentiated lung carcinoma, including adherent monolayer growth patterns, increased cloning efficiency, increased levels of non-SCLC cell markers, ultrastructural characteristics and an acquired resistance to polyamine depletion typical of large cell carcinoma, but not SCLC, in vitro. Expression of v-Ha-ras in biochemical variant SCLC cells directly demonstrates that important transitions can occur between phenotypes of human lung cancer cells and that these may play a critical role in tumor progression events in patients. The findings provide a model system to study molecular events involved in tumor progression steps within a series of related tumor types.\r"

The compound 1-(2-nitro-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N,N,N',N'-tetrakis[(oxycarbonyl)me thyl]-1,2-ethanediamine (DM-nitrophen) binds Ca2+ (Kd approximately 5.0 x 10(-9) M) and Mg2+ (Kd approximately 2.5 x 10(-6) M) with relatively high affinities. On exposure of the DM-nitrophen-Ca2+ complex to UV light in the 350-nm range, the chelator is cleaved yielding iminodiacetic products with a much lower affinity for Ca (Kd approximately 3 x 10(-3) M) and the free [Ca2+] increases. The quantum yield for Ca2+ release is 0.18. In experiments with chemically skinned skeletal muscle fibers, a fully relaxed fiber equilibrated with DM-nitrophen-Ca2+ complex produced maximal contraction after a single flash from a frequency-doubled ruby laser (347 nm). Half-maximal tension was achieved in approximately 40 ms, some 5 times faster than that obtained after a rapid solution change from a Ca2+-free to a Ca2+-containing solution. In experiments with resealed human erythrocyte ghosts, irradiation of ghosts containing the DM-nitrophen-Ca2+ complex activates a Ca2+-dependent K+ efflux pathway, which is not observed in the absence of illumination. DM-nitrophen is sufficiently stable and photolabile to be used as a caged Ca (or caged Mg) for the rapid photoinitiation of divalent cation-dependent processes over a wide concentration range with a significant increase in temporal resolution over conventional mixing methods.\r"

We describe here an in vitro assay system for identifying and characterizing such interactions. Such interactions are difficult to study in vivo. We have translated synthetic, nonmethyl-capped RNAs in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system. The translation products were allowed to interact posttranslationally to form protein-protein complexes. The chemical nature of the protein interaction(s) was determined by coimmunoprecipitation of associating proteins, sedimentation through sucrose gradients, followed by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or by nonreducing NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The system has been utilized to show the self-assembly of monomeric VP1, the major structural protein of simian virus 40, into disulfide-linked pentamers and to show the noncovalent interaction of another structural protein, VP3, with VP1 at low monomer concentrations. Additionally, we show that the carboxyl-terminal 40 amino acids of VP3 are essential and sufficient for its interaction with VP1 in vitro. The in vitro assay system described here provides a method for identifying the domains involved in, and the molecular nature of, protein-protein interactions, which play an important role in such biological phenomena as replication, transcription, translation, transport, ligand binding, and assembly.\r"

Biochemical and genetic studies contend that the scrapie isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc) is a major component of the prion. Limited proteinase K digestion of PrPSc produced a protein of 27-30 kDa. After dispersion of brain microsomes isolated from scrapie-infected hamsters into detergent-lipid-protein complexes, copurification of PrPSc and scrapie infectivity was obtained with scrapie prion protein of 27-30 kDa monoclonal antibody-affinity columns. PrPSc was enriched approximately equal to 5700-fold with respect to total brain protein, whereas scrapie prion infectivity was enriched approximately equal to 4000-fold. The ratio of prion titer to PrPSc remained constant throughout purification. Heterologous monoclonal antibody columns failed to bind either PrPSc or scrapie infectivity. Polyclonal rabbit prion protein antiserum raised against NaDodSO4/PAGE-purified scrapie prion protein of 27-30 kDa reduced scrapie infectivity dispersed into detergent-lipid-protein complexes by a factor of 100. These results represent direct immunologic and chromatographic demonstrations of a relationship between PrPSc and prion infectivity as well as providing additional support for the contention that PrPSc is a major component of the infectious scrapie particle. That PrPSc is a host-encoded protein is an important feature distinguishing prions from viruses.\r"

Using 14C-labeled lambda P protein we showed that the DnaK and DnaJ heat shock proteins function together to release lambda P protein from the preprimosomal complex consisting of lambda origin of replication-lambda O-lambda P-DnaB protein. Hydrolysis of ATP, catalyzed presumably by DnaK, is required during this reaction. Substitution of DnaK protein with that of the mutant DnaK756 protein blocks lambda P release. After DnaK and DnaJ action, the preprimosomal complex, isolated on Sepharose 4B, can support lambda dv DNA replication without any additional prepriming proteins. Using DnaK-affinity chromatography we showed that both lambda O and lambda P proteins bind to DnaK protein. The lambda P protein interacts with DnaK protein in a salt-resistant, hydrophobic manner, and ATP hydrolysis is necessary to elute at least part of lambda P protein from the DnaK-affinity column. The proposed mechanism of action of the prokaryotic DnaK and DnaJ heat shock proteins agrees with the hypothesis that Hsp70, the DnaK analogue of eukaryotes, uses ATP to disrupt hydrophobic aggregates [Pelham, H. R. B. (1986) Cell 46, 959-961].\r"

The larger subunit was only digested to a limited extent (from an apparent Mr 45,000 to Mr 43,000), and the spectral properties were preserved relative to the native enzyme (a reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum with maxima at 447 and 607 nm in the Soret and alpha region, respectively). As judged from CO-reduced spectra this proteolytically digested, one-fragment oxidase was found to contain an equal amount of cytochromes a and a3. The enzymatic activity with reduced cytochrome c as substrate in the presence of Triton X-100 proceeded with equal affinity (apparent Km = 0.5-1.0 microM) and with a Vmax of approximately 20% (40 s-1) of that found with the native enzyme (200 s-1). When the assay system was supplemented with soybean phospholipids, the Km became 2 microM for both enzymes and the Vmax became 730 and 170 s-1 for the native and the digested enzyme, respectively. Thus subunit I of P. denitrificans oxidase, and most probably of the other cytochrome c oxidases as well, contains both hemes and at least one Cu atom and has significant enzymatic activity.\r"

This exchange corresponds to a single base mutation in the codon GAG to AAG and accords with the slow mobility of the three albumins at pH 8.6. Each of the three alloalbumins had been reported to be a new variant, yet they have the same substitution. These results emphasize the need for structural study of genetic variants that have been differentiated only by nonspecific physical criteria such as dye binding and electrophoretic mobility. We know of no other description of the substitution involved in an alloalbumin originating from the Indian subcontinent. However, the same change of glutamic acid----lysine at position 501 may be present in several other named variants reported for populations in north India and the surrounding regions.\r"

Magnesium depletion of the erythrocytes considerably decreases the outward rate of both aminophospholipids to values close to that of phosphatidylcholine. These results suggest that the outward aminophospholipid translocation is, at least partly, protein mediated.

We have investigated the localization of the antiporter in a cloned cell line of porcine renal origin, LLC-PK1/Cl4, which is often considered to be a useful model of the proximal tubule. Transport measurements were performed with differentiated monolayers grown on Nuclepore filters, permitting independent access to the apical and basolateral cell surfaces. In control experiments with LLC-PK1/Cl4 monolayers, three marker transport systems showed the expected polarity: 87% of ouabain-sensitive Rb uptake was at the basolateral surface, and 99% of Na-dependent alpha-methylglucoside transport and 93% of Na-dependent D-aspartate (L-glutamate) transport were at the apical surface. By contrast, the monolayers displayed significant Na/H antiporter activity (assayed as ethylisopropylamiloride-sensitive 22Na uptake) at both cell surfaces, with an apical uptake rate amounting to 44% and a basolateral rate amounting to 56% of the total. Significantly, the apical and basolateral antiporters could readily be distinguished from one another on the basis of ethylispropylamiloride sensitivity. The apical system had an IC50 of 13 microM, close to that reported for kidney brush border vesicle preparations, whereas the basolateral system had an IC50 of 44 nM, similar to values seen in undifferentiated LLC-PK1 cells and other cultured cell lines. The PKE20 mutant, previously selected from LLC-PK1/Cl4 on the basis of resistance to ethylisopropylamiloride, was found to overexpress the more resistant antiporter both during rapid growth and on its apical cell surface at confluence; normal amounts of the more sensitive antiporter were seen on the basolateral surface of confluent PKE20 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that there are two distinct forms of the Na/H antiporter, which are under separate genetic control.\r"

The primary translation product of TYB is a TYA/TYB fusion protein whose expression has been inferred to occur by translational frameshifting within the overlap region. We show that the event leading to expression of TYB is very efficient, resulting in 20% read-through into TYB from TYA. We demonstrate that the Ty mRNA is colinear with the DNA sequence of the element, eliminating any pretranslational model for TYB expression. Frameshifting requires no particular sequence of the upstream TYA gene, nor any global RNA structure. Surprisingly, it can be promoted by a 14-base-pair oligonucleotide of the overlap region. The ability of this oligonucleotide to function is inhibited when it is positioned immediately downstream of an initiator AUG. We conclude that the TYB gene is expressed by an efficient ribosomal frameshifting event requiring a small oligonucleotide sequence derived from the TYA/TYB overlap region.\r"

By using shuttle mutagenesis to insert a selectable marker close to the PI structural gene, evidence was obtained from transformation experiments to demonstrate that the PI structural gene is equivalent to the defined locus nmp and that the genes for PI class A and PI class B are alleles of the same locus. The PI class B gene of strain MS11 was cloned and sequenced, and comparison of this sequence with the gene sequence of PI class A of FA19 revealed a number of regions of significant divergence. By selection for the closely linked marker in transformations between the two strains, a series of strains with a hybrid PI was obtained. Analysis of these strains with monoclonal antibodies and oligonucleotides specific to PI class A or PI class B elucidated the nature and location of some of the surface-exposed epitopes, a thorough characterization of which is a prerequisite for understanding the role of PI in gonococcal pathogenesis and its possible use as a component of a vaccine.\r"

Enzyme replacement therapy is an attractive approach to treatment of this disease. To this aim we constructed retroviral vectors containing a human PNP cDNA and a selectable gene encoding neomycin phosphotransferase. PNP expression was controlled by either the early promoter from simian virus 40, the immediate early promoter from human cytomegalovirus, or the retroviral promoter. Cultured skin fibroblasts from two unrelated PNP-deficient patients that were infected with these vectors expressed mean PNP activities of 0.03, 0.74, and 5.9 mumol/hr per mg of protein, respectively. The latter infectants had PNP activities eight times the level of 0.74 mumol/hr per mg of protein observed in normal skin fibroblasts, enabling rapid metabolism of exogenous deoxyguanosine, the cytotoxic metabolite that accumulates in the plasma of PNP-deficient patients. These experiments indicate that viral long terminal repeat was the strongest promoter for expression of PNP and suggest the potential of human skin fibroblasts as vehicles for therapeutic gene expression.\r"

Two members of the Hawaiian picture-winged Drosophila, D. affinidisjuncta and D. hawaiiensis, display markedly different levels of alcohol dehydrogenase (alcohol: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.1) in the larval midgut and Malpighian tubules. To analyze the regulation of the alcohol dehydrogenase genes from these two species, their homologous alcohol dehydrogenase genes were cloned and introduced, via P element-mediated transformation, into the germ line of Drosophila melanogaster. Histochemical and electrophoretic analyses of larval transformants demonstrate that major differences in the tissue-specific levels of alcohol dehydrogenase production are characteristic of the alcohol dehydrogenase genes themselves. While these results do not directly address possible species-specific differences in the tissue distribution of trans-acting regulatory components, they indicate that demonstrable differences in cis-dominant regulatory information are sufficient to account for the observed regulatory variation.\r"

IL-4 preferentially induced IgE synthesis in vitro. In addition, a low induction of IgG production was observed, whereas IL-4 had no effect on IgA and IgM synthesis. The IL-4-induced IgE production by B cells required T cells and monocytes but was specifically inhibited by an anti-IL-4 antiserum indicating that, although IL-4 acts indirectly, it is responsible for the induction of IgE synthesis. IL-4-induced IgE production was blocked in a dose-dependent way by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interferon alpha (IFN-alpha), and prostaglandin E2. IFN-gamma also inhibited IL-4-induced IgG production. These inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha on IgE production cannot be attributed to toxic effects since IFN-alpha induced IgM production in the presence of IL-4, whereas IFN-gamma was ineffective in inhibiting IgG production induced by IL-2. IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, and prostaglandin E2 also inhibited IL-4-induced expression of the low-affinity receptor for the Fc portion of IgE (CD23) on B cells, indicating that there is an association between CD23 expression and IL-4-induced IgE production. This theory was supported by the finding that IL-4-induced IgE production was inhibited by F(ab')2 fragments of an anti-CD23 monoclonal antibody.\r"

The protein sequence predicted by the B29 coding region contains a leader sequence and a single extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain, followed by a hydrophobic transmembrane segment and a charged intracytoplasmic domain. The immunoglobulin-like domain contains cysteines and other conserved amino acids characteristic of light chain variable and joining regions, but overall the sequence is only distantly related to immunoglobulins. Each of these domains is encoded in separate exons in the B29 gene, in analogy to other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The conserved structural features of the immunoglobulin-like domain in the B29 gene product resemble those of other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily involved in cell recognition and adhesion.\r"

These conserved residues enable folding of the polypeptide segments into the characteristic immunoglobulin fold domains and are the major controllers of interactions between domains. However, crystallographic studies of some immunoglobulin light-chain dimers have suggested and the crystallographic structure of the Fab in an Fab-neuraminidase complex may have proven that antibodies are not restricted to a single, invariant relative positioning of the two variable domains. We propose that in some cases the detailed quaternary structural relationships between the variable domains of heavy and light chains are not restricted to those of the canonical Fab. It is unclear whether alterations of these relationships occur only after complex formation with antigen or, if in ligand-free solution, Fab conformers might coexist in relative concentrations determined by isomerization rates. In the latter case, antibody-presenting lymphocytes may be polyspecific, and the specificity of lymphocytes might be modulated by anti-idiotopic antibodies complexed to cell surface receptors. In either case, the idiotopic repertoire displayed by an antibody or lymphocyte surface receptor might be changed by the presence or absence of antigen.\r"

The effect of phorbol esters on TdT and ADA mRNA levels can be attributed to an apparent decrease in the stability of the mRNAs. The changes in ADA, TdT, and PNP mRNAs closely simulate changes in the activities of these enzymes that occur during T-cell differentiation in vivo, suggesting a role for protein kinase C activation in the regulation of the expression of these genes during intrathymic T-cell differentiation. A role for these purine degradation enzymes in the regulation of intracellular pools of the deoxynucleotide substrates of TdT is discussed.\r"

The DQB sequence inserted into this plasmid was active as an enhancer in Raji cells (human Burkitt lymphoma cells) but not active in Jurkat cells (human T-cell leukemia cells) or in HeLa cells (human cervical carcinoma cells). This cell-type specificity suggests that this enhancer activity may be involved in the tissue specificity of the DQB gene that is normally expressed only in mature B cells, macrophages, and thymic epithelial cells. Deletion analysis showed that both X and Y box sequences are essential for the full activity of the enhancer sequence and that these two sequences may function in a cooperative manner as cis-acting elements. Further deletions were used to define the 5' border of the X element. These results suggest that previously characterized protein factors that bind to X and Y include transcription factors involved in the cell-type specificity of this enhancer activity.\r"

Concomitant with this change in IgM signaling capacity is the appearance of surface IgD, which has been proposed to modulate the response elicited by the mu heavy chain. In an attempt to gain insight into the mechanism(s) by which surface IgM is able to generate such disparate responses, delta heavy chain gene transfectants of the murine B-cell lymphoma line WEHI-231 were established. WEHI-231 cells resemble phenotypically immature B cells, in addition to being highly susceptible to the growth-inhibitory effect of surface IgM cross-linking. Endogenous mu and exogenous delta heavy chains expressed on the surface of the transfectants were compared for their role in cell proliferation and on gene expression. Our results indicate that the growth-inhibitory response is associated only with the mu heavy chain and that surface IgD does not mediate such a response. Furthermore, in contrast to IgM, IgD molecules appear to have an inductive effect on the expression of Myc and the endogenous mu and exogenous delta Ig heavy chain genes but not on the expression of the housekeeping gene encoding beta 2-microglobulin. These findings suggest that IgM and IgD are functionally distinct when expressed on the surface of an immature B cell.\r"

The nucleotide sequences of active segments were determined and compared; these sequences contained the sequence 5' GCCGTCTGAA 3' in common. Subcloning studies confirmed the identity of this sequence as the gonococcal DNA recognition site. The three instances of the recognition sequence isolated from N. gonorrhoeae chromosomal DNA contain the sequence in the immediate neighborhood of its inverted repeat. Because a single copy of the sequence functions as a recognition site, the inverted duplication is not required for specific binding. The dyad symmetric arrangements of the chromosomal recognition sequences may form stable stem-loop structures that can function as terminators or attenuators of transcription. These inverted repeats are located at the boundaries of long open reading frames. The recognition sequence also constitutes part of two other probable terminators of gonococcal genes. We conclude that the signal for recognition of transforming DNA by gonococci is a frequent component of transcriptional terminator sequences. This regulatory function might account for the origin and maintenance of recognition sequences in the chromosomes of Gram-negative transformable bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "Reconstitution of purified mu opioid receptors with purified guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) was investigated. mu opioid receptors were purified by 6-succinylmorphine AF-AminoTOYOPEARL 650M affinity chromatography and by PBE isoelectric chromatography. The purified mu opioid receptor (pI 5.6) migrated as a single Mr 58,000 polypeptide by NaDodSO4/PAGE, a value identical to that obtained by affinity cross-linking purified mu receptors. When purified mu receptors were reconstituted with purified Gi, the G protein that mediates the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, the displacement of [3H]naloxone (a mu opioid antagonist) binding by [D-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (a mu opioid agonist) was increased 215-fold; this increase was abolished by adding 100 microM (guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate. Similar increases in agonist displacement of [3H]naloxone binding (33-fold) and its abolition by guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate were observed with Go, the G protein of unknown function, but not with the v-Ki-ras protein p21. In reconstituted preparations with Gi or Go, neither [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (a delta opioid agonist; where Pen is penicillamine) nor U-69,593 (a kappa opioid agonist) showed displacement of the [3H]naloxone binding. In addition, the mu agonist stimulated both [3H]guanosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate binding (in exchange for GDP) and the low-Km GTPase in such reconstituted preparations, with Gi and Go but not with the v-Ki-ras protein p21, in a naloxone-reversible manner. The stoichiometry was such that the stimulation of 1 mol of mu receptor led to the binding of [3H]guanosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate to 2.5 mol of Gi or to 1.37 mol of Go. These results suggest that the purified mu opioid receptor is functionally coupled to Gi and Go in the reconstituted phospholipid vesicles.\r"

A major goal of pharmacology has been to develop drugs that are more specific for a particular subtype of excitability molecule. DNA cloning has revealed that many excitability proteins are encoded by multigene families and that the diversity of previously recognized pharmacological subtypes is matched, and probably surpassed, by the diversity of messenger RNAs that encode excitability molecules. In general, the diverse subtypes retain their properties when the excitability proteins are expressed in foreign cells such as oocytes and mammalian cell lines. Such heterologous expression may therefore become a tool for testing drugs against specific subtypes. In a systematic research program to exploit this possibility, major considerations include alternative processing of messenger RNA for excitability proteins, coupling to second-messenger systems, and expression of enough protein to provide material for structural studies.\r"

  ".W": "In situ hybridization was used to assess total amyloid protein precursor (APP) messenger RNA and the subset of APP mRNA containing the Kunitz protease inhibitor (KPI) insert in 11 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 7 control brains. In AD, a significant twofold increase was observed in total APP mRNA in nucleus basalis and locus ceruleus neurons but not in hippocampal subicular neurons, neurons of the basis pontis, or occipital cortical neurons. The increase in total APP mRNA in locus ceruleus and nucleus basalis neurons was due exclusively to an increase in APP mRNA lacking the KPI domain. These findings suggest that increased production of APP lacking the KPI domain in nucleus basalis and locus ceruleus neurons may play an important role in the deposition of cerebral amyloid that occurs in AD.\r"

  ".W": "Mapping and manipulation of very large genomes, including the human genome, would be facilitated by the availability of a DNA cleavage method with very high site specificity. Therefore, a general method was devised that extends the effective recognition sequences well beyond the present 8-base pair limit by combining the specificity of the restriction endonuclease with that of another sequence-specific protein that binds tightly to DNA. It was shown that the tightly binding lac or lambda repressor protects a restriction site within the operator from specific modification methylases, M.Hha I or M.Hph I, while all other similar sites are methylated and thus rendered uncleavable. A plasmid containing a symmetric lac operator was specifically cleaved by Hha I, only at the site within the operator, after M.Hha I methylation in the presence of the lac repressor, whereas the remaining 31 Hha I sites on this plasmid were methylated and thus not cleaved. Analogous results were obtained with the Hae II site within the lac operator, which was similarly protected by the lac repressor, and with the Hph I site within the phage lambda oL operator, which was protected by lambda repressor from M.Hph I methylation.\r"

Virtually all CD3-positive T cells derived from transgenic mice express beta chains containing the transgene-encoded V beta 8.2 variable region on their surfaces and do not express endogenous beta-chain variable regions. Expression of endogenous V beta genes is inhibited at the level of somatic recombination during thymic ontogeny. Furthermore, rearrangements of the TCR gamma-chain genes are also markedly inhibited in these transgenic animals. Hence expression of the TCR beta transgene has led to allelic exclusion of alpha beta receptors and isotypic exclusion of gamma delta T cell receptors.\r"

Mutants defective in the synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans also did not form tumors, whereas mutants with altered chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were tumorigenic. Tumors arose from mixtures of wild-type and nontumorigenic mutant cells and contained both cell types, suggesting that wild-type cell proteoglycans enabled mutant cells to survive. The failure of heparan sulfate-deficient mutants to form tumors depended on the ability of the host to mount a B cell-mediated immune reaction.\r"

In the experiments reported here, this hypothesis was tested by studying cell lineage in the rat cortex with a retroviral vector carrying the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene, which can be easily visualized. Labeled, clonally related cortical neurons did not occur in simple columnar arrays. Instead, clonally related neurons entered several different radial columns, apparently by migrating along different radial glial fibers.\r"

The alpha-chain repertoire was dissected at different stages of the selection process by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to amplify only those transcripts of a particular variable region gene (V58). Sequences from these V58 cDNAs reveal the predominant expression of four joining (J) segments by T cells in the adult thymus, suggesting that molecular or cellular processes select particular V alpha J alpha combinations during development. T cells expressing one of these V58J alpha chains appear to have been negatively selected at a later stage, since these transcripts were present in the spleen at approximately one-tenth the level in the thymus. Results also indicate that residues present at the V alpha J alpha junction may be important in an early selection process.\r"

Also, those with the layer-type hematoma on computed tomographic images had higher t-PA levels than those with any other types. The t-PA level in the draining fluid decreased after surgery. In three patients showing a gradual increase of t-PA, subdural fluid reaccumulated and the general condition remained unchanged after surgery. Overproduction of t-PA is considered to initiate intermittent hemorrhage by conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and results in persistence or enlargement of chronic subdural hematoma.\r"

However, the demonstration of volume depletion and natriuresis in some patients has suggested that salt wasting is a more likely etiology. Atrial natriuretic factor appears to play a role in both central and peripheral regulation of sodium homeostasis. To investigate the behavior of circulating atrial natriuretic factor following subarachnoid hemorrhage, we studied 25 patients with intracranial aneurysms: 21 after acute subarachnoid hemorrhage and four without evidence of recent rupture. Atrial natriuretic factor was measured by radioimmunoassay of extracted plasma (normal value, 20.8 +/- 24.6, mean +/- 3 SD). Mean +/- SEM plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration was elevated to 84 +/- 25 pg/ml on Day 1, rose to 134 +/- 29 pg/ml on Day 3, and fell to 86 +/- 17 pg/ml by Day 7 after subarachnoid hemorrhage (p less than 0.01). In two patients (9.5%) who developed hyponatremia after aneurysm rupture, plasma concentrations were no different from that in the group as a whole; concentrations in patients with no evidence of recent subarachnoid hemorrhage were not elevated. Neither fluid administration nor timing of surgery could account for the elevated concentrations. We conclude that concentrations of circulating atrial natriuretic factor are elevated after subarachnoid hemorrhage but do not solely account for the accompanying hyponatremia.\r"

This figure includes physician training expenses, professional fees, personnel, equipment and maintenance costs, costs for exams repeated due to technical error, and costs for additional consultation by a radiologist. Previously, all exams were referred to other consultants, and the charge was $185 per exam. Thus, in-office ultrasound exams performed by family physicians can provide cost savings while maintaining high standards of obstetric care.\r"

Transient increases in plasma ANP, in four cardiac recipients 3-10-fold their basal levels, could neither be related to rejection episodes nor to cardiac dysfunction, but rather to signs of fluid and sodium retention.

In addition, 12 of the normotensive, 7 of the hypertensive patients and 11 of the control subjects were studied with the same parameters after an exercise test (Study 2). Study 1 showed that supine ANP, AII and Aldo did not differ significantly between the groups. In Study 2, ANP increased after exercise in the normotensive patients (8.4 vs. 11.4 pmol/l (median), p less than 0.05) and control subjects (7.6 vs. 9.3 pmol/l, p less than 0.02) but not in the hypertensives (7.6 vs. 7.9 pmol/l, p greater than 0.10), and after exercise ANP was increased in the normotensive patients compared with the controls (p less than 0.02). After exercise, an enhanced increase of Aldo was found in the hypertensives but not in the normotensive patients compared with the controls, whereas the increase of AII did not differ significantly between the groups. It is concluded that patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and relatively well preserved renal function do not have major abnormalities of ANP at rest or during exercise. In the normotensive patients, however, ANP increased to a higher level than in the controls, but the difference was small and further studies are needed to define the role of ANP in blood pressure regulation of early stage chronic glomerulonephritis.\r"

In the supine position, although activation of the various neurohumoral systems tended to occur in the same patients, there was little correlation between activation of any of the neurohumoral systems, as reflected by circulating levels, and systemic vascular resistance. There was also little correlation between changes in circulating neurohormones and changes in either mean arterial pressure or systemic vascular resistance in the standing position. Acutely reducing the activity of the renin-angiotensin system with the use of captopril did not improve the correlation between other neurohumoral and hemodynamic variables. In fact there was no correlation between the effects of acute captopril therapy and baseline renin values. These results support the concept that activation of one or another vasoconstrictor neurohumoral system varies from patient to patient and that the effects of their activation are tempered by activation of parallel vasodilator systems and by attenuation of neurohormone release and effector organ response.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the role of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in unstable angina, it was compared with placebo in a randomized, double-blind trial. Forty patients with angina at rest and provocable ischemia (pacing induced) had baseline coronary angiography, study drug infusion and then repeat angiography at 20 +/- 9 hours. All patients received diltiazem, nitrates, beta blockers, aspirin and intravenous heparin. During study drug infusion (150 mg over 8 hours), refractory ischemia necessitating emergency bypass surgery (CABG) or coronary angioplasty (PTCA) occurred in 4 of 20 t-PA patients compared with 1 of 20 placebo patients (p = 0.21). Before discharge, revascularization for persistent, provocable ischemia and a residual stenosis greater than or equal to 60% was as follows: t-PA patients, 8 PTCA and 7 CABG; placebo patients, 11 PTCA and 8 CABG (p = 0.39). Quantitative angiographic percent diameter stenosis of the culprit artery at baseline and follow-up was: t-PA 71 +/- 17 and 63 +/- 22; placebo 70 +/- 19 and 67 +/- 22 (difference not significant). However, 3 t-PA patients compared with no placebo patients demonstrated an insignificant (less than 60% diameter) residual stenosis and averted PTCA (p = 0.14). There were no complications of PTCA in the 8 t-PA patients; in contrast, 3 of 11 placebo patients had abrupt closure, necessitating emergency CABG in 2 (p = 0.23). Thus, intravenous t-PA in unstable angina can eliminate the need for PTCA in a few patients, does not appear to decrease the overall or emergency rate of revascularization procedures and may facilitate the safety of PTCA.\r"

In addition, its use has been associated with prolonged bleeding times and hemorrhagic complications. Despite these experimental and clinical observations, no significant antiplatelet effect of nitroglycerin has been observed ex vivo during intravenous nitroglycerin administration to patients. Because the in vitro antiplatelet effects of nitroglycerin have been shown by one of the investigators participating in this study to depend on the presence of sufficient stores of reduced intracellular thiol--which are readily depleted ex vivo by nitroglycerin in the formation of S-nitrosothiols--an attempt was made to unmask nitroglycerin-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation by exposing platelets taken from patients treated with nitroglycerin to the reduced thiol N-acetylcysteine ex vivo. The obtained data demonstrate that platelets taken from patients treated with intravenous nitroglycerin manifest attenuated aggregation responses ex vivo when thiol stores are repleted. It is therefore proposed that the mechanism of action of nitroglycerin is mediated in part by its antiplatelet effect and that this effect depends on the adequacy of reduced intracellular thiol stores.\r"

  ".W": "The degree of activation of neurohormonal mechanisms appears to depend on the severity and acuteness of cardiac impairment as well as the status of the extracellular fluid volume. Vasoconstrictive antinatriuretic mechanisms are markedly activated in severe decompensated cardiac failure. These are accompanied by parallel increases in endogenous vasodilatory natriuretic activities that modulate the powerful vasoconstrictive mechanisms. During chronic compensation, many of these neuroendocrine mechanisms returned to the baseline normal level. In addition to endocrine and neurogenic mechanisms, local autocrine-paracrine systems in the blood vessel wall may also contribute to the regulation of vascular tone. The role of these systems in congestive heart failure has not been systematically studied. It is possible that they may contribute to the long-term regulation of vascular tone and therefore may play an increasing role in the pathogenesis of ventricular remodeling, dilatation and progressive congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Pressure or volume overload of the myocardium increases the wall stress, particularly of the subendocardium, and leads to hypertrophy. Even though cardiac hypertrophy is viewed as a beneficial compensatory process that normalizes wall stress, the increased muscle mass carries with it the need of increased blood supply. Overall flow per unit mass is similar at rest in hypertrophic and normal hearts but a reduction of flow to the subendocardium and an increase in minimal coronary vascular resistance have been described. Thus, the potential exists for a vasodilator-induced steal mechanism shunting blood away from potentially ischemic areas. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduced myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary blood flow in parallel manner in some studies, indicating preserved coronary autoregulation, but there is also some evidence of a coronary vasodilator effect. Calcium antagonists reduce coronary vascular resistance and improve the myocardial demand-supply ratio, but the clinical usefulness of the newer compounds with supposedly little or no negative inotropic effects remains to be established. Hydralazine improved the myocardial oxygen demand-supply ratio in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, but metabolic function may deteriorate more often after hydralazine than after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with coronary heart disease. Similar observations have been made using alpha-adrenergic blockers. Although progress has been made in the understanding of the coronary circulation and the influence of vasodilators in congestive heart failure, many questions await clarification using refined or new methodology.\r"

Although natriuresis associated with SVT may be secondary to the augmented secretion of ANP, whether or not physiologic changes other than natriuresis can be attributed to the release of ANP has not been determined. In the present study, plasma ANP levels in 10 patients with SVT were found to be significantly (p less than 0.05) increased, from 37 +/- 11 pg/ml (mean +/- standard error of the mean) during the control period to 160 +/- 54 pg/ml at 60 minutes after the induction of SVT. Urinary sodium excretion, although insignificant, tended to increase during the 30-minute period after SVT termination. The filtration fraction determined by the ratio of creatinine to para-aminohippurate clearance significantly increased during SVT. An increase in capillary permeability seemed to have occurred as there was a rise of hematocrit, the changes of which showed a different time course from that of the urine volume. The ratio of plasma aldosterone concentration to plasma renin activity significantly decreased during SVT. As the same effects are observed after ANP infusion, these changes were attributed to ANP activity.\r"

An electrophysiologic study was performed before and after intravenous flecainide acetate, 2 mg/kg body weight, was infused over 15 minutes and was followed by a maintenance infusion of 1.6 mg/kg given over 1 hour to 26 patients and during oral treatment to 15. Treatment with oral flecainide acetate was continued for 14 +/- 5 months. Intravenous flecainide acetate terminated AV nodal tachycardia by blocking the retrograde fast pathway conduction in 7 of 7 patients and AV tachycardia by blocking retrograde conduction in the extranodal pathway in 10 of 10 patients. AV nodal tachycardia and AV tachycardia were noninducible in 8 of 9 patients (90%, p less than 0.001) and 11 of 17 patients (65%, p less than 0.001), respectively. Long-term treatment with oral flecainide acetate suppressed AV nodal tachycardia and AV tachycardia in 8 of 9 patients (90%, p less than 0.001) and 11 of 17 patients (65%, p less than 0.001), respectively. A favorable outcome was associated with block in the accessory pathway after intravenous flecainide acetate and noninducibility during oral treatment. Recurrences preferentially occurred in the younger patients. Flecainide acetate is effective in the acute and long-term management of paroxysmal supraventricular reentry tachycardia by suppressing conduction through the retrograde fast limb of the tachycardia circuit. The clinical effect can be predicted by electrophysiologic testing.\r"

Carnitine infusion did not significantly affect nitrogen balance, protein content of liver and muscle, plasma concentrations of BCAA and branched-chain keto acid, or leucine oxidation and incorporation into liver and muscle proteins of either starved or fed rats. Despite a two- to threefold increase in plasma carnitine level, tissue concentrations of carnitine and its acyl-derivatives were not significantly affected by carnitine infusion. Of the amount of carnitine infused, 91% was lost in the urine of starved rats and 87% in the urine of fed rats. We conclude that intravenous carnitine infusion does not affect protein and BCAA metabolism and that this lack of effect may be related to the failure of carnitine infusion to enrich tissue pools of carnitine.\r"

We investigated the effect of intravenous P on urinary and fecal Ca loss in intravenously fed normal and thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rats to assess the role of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and endogenous fecal Ca losses. Doubling the intravenous P load during TPN decreased urinary Ca losses by 54% (0.299 vs 0.137 mmol/d) in intact rats and by 43% (0.514 vs 0.294 mmol/d) in TPTX rats. Increased P load in normal rats had no effect on urinary cyclic AMP excretion, serum Ca, serum P, serum 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, or endogenous fecal Ca losses. These observations suggest that the hypocalciuric effect of P during TPN is independent of PTH and is not caused by a repartitioning of obligatory Ca losses from the renal to the intestinal route.\r"

A significant inverse relationship was found between PaCO2 and body weight; a parallel decrease of both somatic proteins and body-energy stores of fat appears to be paired with decreasing body weight. Deterioration of nutritional status occurred in the COPD patients considered despite seemingly adequate calorie and protein intakes, although in patients with more severe impairment of pulmonary gas exchange, calorie intake was significantly lower compared with basal energy expenditure. In the course of hypercapnic-hypoxemic COPD malnutrition is common, it is related to the severity of the disease as judged by the need for hospitalization and degree of impairment of gas exchange, and it may be present despite apparently adequate nutrient intake.\r"

Spuriously high blood phenylalanine levels occurred in four babies who were receiving ampicillin and whose specimens were collected on filter paper and autoclaved in preparation for the BIA.

If blood donors could be tested for their ALT levels before blood donation, unnecessary discarding of blood and related expenses could be eliminated. Therefore, the authors evaluated a table-top ALT analyzer for screening donors before blood donation. The method was precise and linear and correlated well with the SMAC-II analyzer. Based on a cost-savings analysis, the authors found it to be financially beneficial to perform predonation ALT testing. Because the cost of labor and reagents may vary from institution to institution, however, other facilities should perform their own cost-savings analyses before implementing predonation ALT testing.\r"

In portal areas, the OKT4:OKT8 ratio reversed because of the relative increase of OKT8+ cells. The mean intraportal T4:T8 ratio was significantly lower in HBV-associated chronic active hepatitis (CAH) than in chronic persistent hepatitis induced by HBV or NANB viruses. OKT8+ cells were predominant in the infiltrates of periportal areas (piecemeal necrosis) and lobules. As to the activation status of the infiltrates, T10 was found much more frequently on mononuclear infiltrates of piecemeal necrosis and peripheral portion of portal areas in CAH cases, regardless of viral etiology, and its existence was correlated with the severity of CAH. Natural killer cells, killer cells, and B-cells played little role in the pathogenesis of hepatocytolysis. We conclude that T-cell cytotoxicity is the main mechanism of hepatocytolysis, either in lobules or in periportal regions, and that T10 antigen defines a group of cells which may play an important role associated with the formation of piecemeal necrosis.\r"

The hospital industry contends that DRGs are underpaying for hospital care, especially for certain types of patients. Analysis of 2,500 gastroenterology patients by outcome (i.e., survivors vs mortalities) demonstrated that the 122 mortalities had a much greater intensity of hospital resource utilization, and generated substantial financial risk under DRG pricing schemes, compared with the 2,378 survivors. Only mortalities that occurred within 1 wk of admission to the hospital were profitable under DRGs. A long hospital length of stay (LOS) for mortalities was very unprofitable (mortalities with more than a 60-day LOS generated $20,210 loss per patient). Emergency gastroenterology admissions who died had greater financial risk under DRGs, compared to nonemergency mortalities. Those mortalities referred to gastroenterology from other clinical services tended to have greater resource utilization and financial risk under DRGs, compared with nonreferred mortalities. These data suggest significant inequities in the current DRG prospective payment system vis-a-vis gastrotenterology mortalities. Predictive variables of greater hospital resource utilization for gastroenterology mortalities include longer hospital lengths of stay, emergency admission, and referral from another clinical service. If equity of DRG payment is not improved by the federal government, certain groups of patients likely to be mortalities may suffer a decline in access and/or the quality of medical care in the future.\r"

It has frequently been suggested that fragile sites may be involved in chromosome breakage and recombination events. We and others have previously shown that fragile sites predispose to intrachromosomal recombination as measured by sister-chromatid exchanges. These findings suggested that fragile site expression often, if not always, is accompanied by DNA strand breakage. In the present report, fragile sites are shown to predispose to deletions and interchromosomal recombination. By use of somatic cell hybrids containing either human chromosome 3 or the fragile X chromosome, deletions and translocations were induced by FUdR or aphidicolin with breakpoints at the fragile sites Xq27 or 3p14.2 (FRA3B) or at points so close to the fragile sites as to be cytogenetically indistinguishable. Southern blot analysis of DNA from a panel of chromosome 3 deletion and translocation hybrids was then utilized to detect loss or retention of markers flanking FRA3B and to corroborate the cytogenetic evidence that the breakpoints were at this fragile site. One cell line with a reciprocal translocation between human chromosome 3 (with breakpoint at 3p14.2) and a hamster chromosome showed cytogenetically that the fragile site was expressed on both derivative chromosomes, supporting the hypothesis that the fragile site represents a repeated sequence. The approach described provides a means of generating specific rearrangements in somatic cell hybrids with a breakpoint at a fragile site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a case of sporadic hemophilia, associated with a partial deletion of the factor VIII gene, an unexpected inheritance pattern of gene rearrangements was observed. The factor VIII gene was found to be partially duplicated in the hemophiliac's mother. A pedigree analysis indicates that the mother has contributed both aberrant genes as well as the normal gene to her offspring. One simple model for the evolution of the deletion in this family is that the duplication is the precursor to the deletion.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Little attention has been paid to the importance of clinical factors associated with bleeding complications caused by the use of thrombolytic agents. The goal of our study was to examine clinical and hematologic factors associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a prospectively observed population that received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for acute myocardial infarction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bleeding complications were evaluated in 386 consecutive patients treated with 150 mg of tissue plasminogen activator over six to eight hours for acute myocardial infarction. All patients also underwent immediate cardiac catheterization. RESULTS: Quantitation of blood loss during the patients' hospital stay included a median drop in hematocrit of 11.4 points, a median nadir hematocrit of 31.2, a 14 percent rate of significant clinically evident bleeding, and a 31 percent rate of transfusion of two or more units of blood. All of these parameters were much more severe in patients treated with coronary artery bypass surgery. Access site hematoma was the most common source of bleeding (45 percent of patients), whereas 8 percent had gastrointestinal bleeding, two patients had retroperitoneal bleeding, and two patients had intracranial bleeding. The median nadir fibrinogen was 1.3 g/liter. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the relationship between clinical variables, including multiple hematologic measurements, and measures of the amount of blood loss. The use of coronary artery bypass grafting was the variable most closely associated with hemorrhage. Other invasive procedures (angioplasty and intra-aortic balloon pumping) were also associated with increased bleeding. Among the patient descriptors examined, lighter weight, older age, female sex, and history of hypertension were associated with greater blood loss. Of laboratory coagulation parameters, only nadir fibrinogen levels were significantly associated with more bleeding. CONCLUSION: Careful clinical evaluation may improve assessment of the risk/benefit ratio of thrombolytic therapy.\r"

  ".U": "88324507\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: It is possible that abnormalities in atrial natriuretic peptide may be involved in the pathogenesis of sodium retention in edema states. We performed a study in a group of 12 sodium-retaining cirrhotic subjects to determine the role of this peptide in mediating differences in the natriuretic response to central volume expansion induced by head-out water immersion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Each patient was maintained for seven days on a 20-mmol sodium intake, and then studied on both control and immersion days. On each day, measurements of the following were obtained: plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, hematocrit, electrolytes, creatinine, plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone, urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), blood pressure, and pulse rate. RESULTS: In six subjects, immersion resulted in a marked natriuresis sufficient to induce negative sodium balance by the third hour, and these subjects were termed \"responders.\" In these six patients, baseline pre-immersion levels of plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone were all below 3 ng/liter/second and 4 nmol/liter, respectively. In the other six subjects, the natriuretic response to immersion was markedly blunted and insufficient to induce negative sodium balance, and these subjects were termed \"non-responders.\" In these subjects, baseline pre-immersion levels of plasma renin activity and aldosterone were all above 3.5 ng/liter/second and 5 nmol/liter, respectively, and were significantly elevated compared with the responders, and compared with the normal range for control subjects consuming the same sodium intake. In both groups of cirrhotic subjects, baseline levels of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and cGMP excretion were significantly and comparably elevated compared with the normal range for control subjects ingesting the same sodium intake. Despite the marked difference in the natriuretic response to immersion in both responders and non-responders, there was a significant and comparable further elevation of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and urinary cGMP excretion during immersion, compared with the control day. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the relative resistance to the natriuretic action of atrial natriuretic peptide in the non-responders compared with the responders is mediated by anti-natriuretic factors acting at a level parallel with or beyond atrial natriuretic peptide release or coupling to its cGMP-linked receptors.\r"

  ".U": "88324590\r", 
  ".W": "Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (KC) grown under conditions that maintain the undifferentiated state are highly motile. Migration of these cells as measured in two different assays (migration out of an agarose drop explant, and into micropore filters in a modified Boyden chamber), is stimulated by fibronectin (FN) and to a lesser extent by thrombospondin (TSP). In contrast, laminin (LN) inhibits KC migration. Cultivation of the cells for 1 day under conditions that induce differentiation (ie, in the presence of 1.4 mM Ca2+) suppresses KC motility. A number of soluble growth modulating polypeptide factors also influence KC migration. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulate KC motility. These factors simultaneously induce KC production of FN and a significant portion of the stimulated motility can be inhibited with antibodies to FN. EGF and somatomedin-C (SM-C), but not TGF-beta, also stimulate TSP production while EGF and SM-C (but not TGF-beta) induce KC proliferation. In contrast to these factors, interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) inhibits KC production of both FN and TSP and concomitantly inhibits both motility and proliferation. These data suggest that KC properties essential for normal wound healing (ie, motility and proliferation) are regulated by both extracellular matrix molecules and soluble peptide factors. Finally, these effects of various growth promoting and antiproliferative factors on KCs may, in part, be mediated through alteration in the endogenous production of extracellular matrix molecules by KCs.\r"

The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of six infrared-based capnometers and one multiplexed mass spectrometer available at our institution at increasing frequency. Capnometers studied were the Datascope Accucap, Hewlett-Packard 47210A capnometer, Narkomed 3 Capnomed, Novametrix Capnogard model 1250, Perkin-Elmer Advantage, Puritan-Bennett Datex CO2 monitor, and Traverse Medical Monitor model 2200 capnometer. Changes in CO2 concentration were generated by a solenoid valve switching between 100% O2 and 7% CO2 in O2. Frequencies, 8-101 cycles/min were chosen to stimulate a range that might be generated by children during general endotracheal anesthesia. At every rate the displayed PETCO2 was recorded. Differences in displayed PETCO2 from known CO2 ranged from -16.4 to +6.6. At or below frequencies of 31 cycles/min, four capnometers overreported and three underreported PETCO2. At frequencies above 31 cycles/min, six capnometers underreported and one overreported PETCO2. Errors may be clinically significant if they influence ventilator settings for patients.\r"

A standardized sequential treatment approach was followed for evacuation of the pneumothorax and maintenance of lung reexpansion. The protocol involved catheter placement using a Seldinger technique, aspirations, and documentation of reexpansion by chest radiography and observation. Reaccumulation of air was treated with Heimlich valve attachment to the catheter at intrapleural pressure and further observation. Continued air leak following Heimlich valve attachment was treated with chest catheter suction using a Pleurovac at -20 cm H2O pressure. Chest tube thoracostomy was performed for continued failure of reexpansion. In 22 of the 37 pneumothoraces (59%) simple catheter aspiration maintained lung reexpansion without complications. In the remaining 15 pneumothoraces (41%), seven (47%) responded to Heimlich valve attachment, and three (20%) maintained expansion with chest catheter suction. Chest tube thoracotomy was required to maintain expansion in 33% (five) of those who failed catheter suction (14% of all pneumothoraces studied). Patients treated successfully with simple catheter aspiration were sent home. Patients requiring a Heimlich valve, chest catheter suction, or chest tube thoracostomy were hospitalized. Use of these catheter techniques resulted in lower cost and was associated with shorter hospitalizations than in chest tube thoracostomy. Our study suggests that sequential treatment of simple pneumothorax should be considered as a cost-effective and therapeutically successful alternative to immediate chest thoracostomy in selected cases.\r"

The objective diagnosis-related group (DRG) criteria for admission were compared retrospectively with the physician's clinical judgment of need for hospitalization. Clinical outcome was used to establish the correctness of the decision to hospitalize. Clinical judgment was compared with objective DRG criteria for reliability in predicting the presence of serious pathology necessitating acute care hospitalization; respective values were sensitivity, 100% vs 76%; specificity, 86% vs 80%; positive predictive value, 75% vs 62%; and negative predictive value, 100% vs 89%. The difference between the sensitivity of the two admission criteria was highly significant (P less than 10(-8); chi 2, 26.12). We conclude that the physician's clinical judgment outperforms DRG objective criteria in identifying which patients with critical diagnostic syndromes need acute care hospitalization for emergency medical or surgical therapy.\r"

This data suggests that the current DRG classification scheme may be inequitable vis-a-vis older Medicare patients in the non-age stratified surgical DRGs, and could provide financial disincentives that limit both their access and quality of care in the future.\r"

Experience with four patients with long term Foley feeding gastrostomies revealed two types of complications that occurred 23 times, a) the rupture of the balloon fourteen times allowing the catheter to slip out and b) distal migration of the balloon causing intestinal obstruction nine times. Since long term feeding gastrostomies using a Foley catheter will continue to be used and probably increase with the recent modifications of the PEG it is essential that physicians and emergency room personnel be informed of those two complications. If and when either rupture of the balloon or distal migration occur, the Foley should be replaced with a mushroom catheter. Once the gastrocutaneous fistula is mature, usually after 2 weeks, it is safe to insert a mushroom catheter, which is not subject to those complications.\r"

The activity in unstimulated monocytes cultured for 24 and 48 hours was found to be higher than normal in 56% of patients with active relapsing MS, 29% of patients with RA, and 7% of patients in the MG/MND group. While the enzyme activity was reduced after cultivation of the cells with recombinant interferon-gamma (gamma-IFN) in all of the groups studied, the percentage reduction was significantly greater in monocytes from patients with active relapsing MS who were in relapse at the time of sampling (p = 0.03). HLA-DR expression was monitored using immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibody and showed that similar numbers of monocytes in all patient and control groups expressed this antigen. Thus, while high monocyte 5'NT activity was found principally in patients with active relapsing MS and in some patients with RA, the monocytes from patients with MS were, in addition, exquisitely sensitive to stimulation with gamma-IFN.\r"

This procedure, however, carries an unacceptable 33% risk of late complications due to cerebral hemosiderosis. Anatomically partial but functionally complete hemispherectomy was devised to avoid these complications. The frontal or occipital lobes, or both, were left in place with the blood supply intact but with connections to commissures and brainstem divided. The central strip and parietal and temporal lobes were removed. Twenty patients were so treated with a follow-up of 4 to 13 years (average, 7.3 years) in 14. Ten of these are seizure free, 1 had a single nocturnal seizure, 1 had occasional focal twitching, and 2 had a worthwhile but lesser reduction in the seizure tendency. None has developed cerebral hemosiderosis, to date. In appropriately selected patients, functional hemispherectomy is an effective procedure preferable to callosotomy or to partial hemispherectomy. When there is no independent ictal discharge from the opposite hemisphere, arrest of seizures may be expected, leading to improvement in cognitive functioning (mean increase, 10 IQ points), social behavior, and a reduction in or discontinuation of anticonvulsant medication. In these patients, gait and hand use remain unchanged.\r"

Unlike cationic detergents, such as chlorhexidine, they did not cause disruption of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane over a short time period.

In rabbits treated for 3 days, daptomycin significantly reduced bacterial counts of vegetations compared with no therapy but was significantly less effective than penicillin G procaine or vancomycin. Daptomycin-gentamicin significantly reduced bacterial counts of vegetations compared with daptomycin alone but was significantly less effective than vancomycin plus gentamicin. The efficacy of daptomycin-gentamicin did not differ significantly from that of penicillin G procaine-gentamicin. The lack of enterococcal killing by daptomycin alone in serum and in experimental endocarditis is probably related to the high protein binding of the agent.\r"

We have compared the activities of these drugs and other antimicrobial agents in an immunosuppressed rat model of P. carinii pneumonia. Diminazene, imidocarb, amicarbalide, quinapyramine, and isometamidium showed efficacy greater than or equal to that of pentamidine in the therapy of P. carinii infection, whereas ethidium and methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) were only slightly active against the organism. Diminazene and pentamidine also exhibited comparable efficacy in P. carinii prophylaxis, alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a polyamine inhibitor, was ineffective therapy when used alone and did not improve the effectiveness of pentamidine or diminazene. Quinine, quinidine, quinacrine, chlorpromazine, spiramycin, Pentostam, Astiban, dehydroemetine, ampicillin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and spectinomycin also showed little or no activity against the organism. Thus, in this model anti-P. carinii activity appears to be a common property of veterinary cationic trypanocidal compounds. This should be important in studying structure-activity relationships and in developing new drugs for the treatment of P. carinii infection in humans.\r"

These changes correlated significantly with the increase in fetal haemoglobin and packed cell volume. Five transfusions were associated with complications within six hours: intrauterine death in two, fetal-distress necessitating delivery in two, and preterm labour in one.

If costs are related to outcome up to the age of 4 they get progressively less over the three year study period. After the age of 4 the costs of special education and residential care dominate, and the cost trend is reversed.\r"

A potentially significant discrepancy (arbitrarily defined as 0.05 units for pH. 1 kPa for PCO2, and 3 kPa for PO2) was found in 19 (24%) of cases for pH, in 9 (11%) for PCO2 and in 21 (26%) for PO2. Warming the heel produced no significant improvement in results. We conclude that capillary blood provides satisfactory measurements of pH and PCO2 for all but the most critical purposes, but that the usefulness of capillary PO2 estimations is limited to the exclusion of hypoxia.\r"

  ".W": "Current reports indicate that collagen fiber disruption resulting from cyclic leaflet bending is a factor determining long-term durability of bioprosthetic heart valves. Examination of the opening characteristics of porcine xenografts has shown two areas of high bending curvature that correlate well with sites of leaflet tearing. These are at the free edge and near the attachment of the leaflets to the aortic root. To determine the potential effects of sharp bends in leaflet material, we examined 15 strips each of fresh and glutaraldehyde-treated porcine aortic valve tissue. Leaflet strips were bent to curvatures of 0.18 mm-1 to 6.67 mm-1, histologically processed, sectioned, and examined under a light microscope. We observed severe compressive buckling in the samples taken from bioprosthetic valves but little in the fresh-tissue samples. At physiological curvatures (less than 0.28 mm-1), no buckling occurred in the fresh tissue; at high bending curvatures (2.0 mm-1), the depth of buckling observed in the treated tissue was 100% greater than that in the fresh. We believe that porcine xenograft failure is related to compressive buckling of the aldehyde-treated tissue and is mediated by the systematic breaking of collagen fibers at the site of buckling. We suggest that alternative valve designs and preservation techniques be employed to prevent such abnormal leaflet deformations.\r"

Covalent binding of aminopropanehydroxy-diphosphonate (APDP) to residual glutaraldehyde in pericardial BPHV tissue was studied as an approach for the inhibition of calcification. BPHV tissue was preincubated in 0.14 M APDP at pH 7.4, 9.0, and 11.0 for various durations (1 hour to 8 days). The need for NaBH4 stabilization of the tissue-bound APDP was also examined in vitro. The bound APDP was determined using 14C-labeled APDP. APDP uptake was dependent on incubation duration and pH. Calcification of APDP-pretreated BPHV was studied using 21-day rat subdermal implants. Calcification inhibition was directly related to the amount of tissue APDP incorporation. Inhibition of calcification to less than 15% of control was achieved with a concentration of bound APDP of greater than or equal to 30 nM/mg dry tissue with more than 1 hour of incubation at pH 11.0 (bound APDP, 33.55 nM/mg; BPHV calcium content = 3.1 +/- 0.9 micrograms/mg). No adverse effects such as rat growth inhibition or disruption of bone architecture were observed after any treatment. Additionally, in vitro, NaBH4 stabilized tissue-bound APDP. In conclusion, APDP covalently bound to residual aldehyde functions markedly inhibited calcification of BPHV tissue. This inhibition was dependent on the amount of APDP incorporated. NaBH4 stabilized APDP-glutaraldehyde covalent bonds.\r"

  ".W": "We performed an observational study to determine the prevalence of severe dementia in a general medicine unit, the categories of acute medical care provided to these patients, the process by which treatment decisions are made, and their cost implications. The prevalence of severe dementia was 4.4%. The patients from whom some form of acute medical care was withheld (26 [45.6%] of 57) were more severely ill at admission and had a mortality rate five times higher than those who received full care. Physicians cited family wishes in 75.9% of the decisions to limit care but in only 10.9% of the decisions to give full care. The only differences in charges incurred were due to differential mortality rates in individuals from whom care was withheld. We recommend that hospitals develop and implement protocols for decision making in the care of the severely demented to promote open discussions among providers and families and to increase family contributions to decision making. We believe that the extension of this consultative approach to decisions involving severely demented patients may have the virtue of combining more humane care with more cost-effective care.\r"

  ".W": "A comprehensive control program for utilization of anti-microbial agents in a large tertiary university teaching hospital regulates both dosage and duration of therapy and requires the prior approval of an infectious disease specialist for utilization of restricted antimicrobial agents. Benefits of the program include more cost-effective antimicrobial therapy and increased physician education in the use of these drugs. Gross savings in pharmacy costs for antibiotics during the first year of the program (1985) amounted to +483,032 for an average monthly savings of +40,252. Gross savings for 1986 were +211,786 with monthly savings of +17,648. The control of the use of one agent may lead to overuse of another agent. Antimicrobial prescribing patterns of physicians are quickly influenced by changing regulations of the program. An ongoing surveillance and review program of in-hospital utilization of antimicrobial agents is necessary to maintain effective and flexible controls.\r"

Performance of these laboratories on the ABO and Rh challenges was good, with 99.7% to 99.9% of the participants reporting the correct response. Antibody identification showed less consistency (45.4% to 97.5%). These challenges consisted of two serum samples with multiple antibodies, one serum sample with antibody to a high-incidence antigen, and one serum sample with anti-M. Performance on the cross match ranged from 95.0% to 99.8% correct, with one exception. This exception was an intended incompatible cross match with the serum containing anti-M, which was reported as incompatible by 56.2% of participants. The antigen-typing challenges ranged from 98.3% to 100% correct, but three typings proved to be a problem. Two samples, when typed for the c antigen, were correctly typed 70.4% of the time and 50.1% of the time. One of these samples, when typed for the E antigen, was correctly typed only 30% of the time. This discrepancy proved to be the result of inadvertent pooling of units of different phenotypes in the sample preparation process.\r"

Liver biopsies of 93 patients who were concurrently receiving TPN were compared with a control group of 35 patients. The control patients were matched for extent of preexisting liver disease and degree of illness. The liver biopsy specimens were blindly graded on 19 histopathologic findings, including fatty change, portal inflammation, and cholestasis. Twenty-seven clinical variables, such as preexisting liver disease, the presence or absence of sepsis or shock, and number of days receiving TPN before biopsy, were recorded. Individual and partial correlations were established between the clinical variables and histopathologic findings. The control and TPN groups proved to have been closely matched regarding the extent of risk factors for hepatic histopathologic features. Positive correlations were repeatedly found between abnormal hepatic histologic features and preexisting liver disease, abdominal sepsis, renal failure, and blood transfusion but not with the administration of TPN. We conclude that clinical phenomena, such as existing liver disease, renal failure, and abdominal sepsis, rather than administration of TPN, had a predominant effect on histopathologic features in this group of patients.\r"

The effect of injury on ventilatory function was significantly greater in the patients with tracheobronchial injury in whom an elevated PCO2 at the time of admission was associated with a poor prognosis. Conventional ventilatory management with endotracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation causing increased air leakage produced further deterioration of pulmonary function in four of the patients with tracheobronchial disruption. The use of a double-lumen endobronchial tube in two patients with tracheobronchial rupture facilitated ventilatory support and subsequent operative management.\r"

Both young and adult SHR had undetectable ANP binding in superior cervical and stellate sympathetic ganglia, pituitary gland, thymus and spleen, and lower binding in subfornical organ and choroid plexus. Conversely, in young SHRs and WKY rats, ANP binding site density was similar in adrenal zona glomerulosa, kidney glomeruli, and papilla. The SHRs have notable tissue specific decrease in ANP binding site concentration. This alteration may relate to the pathophysiology of genetic hypertension.\r"

The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of CGRP in the feline mesenteric vascular bed under conditions of controlled blood flow. Bolus injections of CGRP decreased mesenteric perfusion pressure in a dose-related fashion. When compared with nitroglycerin, CGRP possesses markedly greater vasodilator activity in the intestinal vascular bed of the cat. Because circulating levels of CGRP have been identified, the present data suggest CGRP may play a role in the regulation of systemic vasomotor tone and regional hemodynamics, as well as involve altered calcium metabolism seen with other calcium-regulating hormones in hypertensive states.\r"

Of 98 patients enrolled, 73 completed the study and were deemed valid for efficacy analyses; 36 in the ISRP group and 37 in the HCTZ group. Monotherapy with ISRP significantly (P less than 0.001) decreased (mean +/- SD) sitting systolic blood pressure (BP) from 146 +/- 11 mm Hg to 128 +/- 11 mm Hg and diastolic BP from 100 +/- 4 mm Hg to 83 +/- 5 mm Hg. Heart rate during the plateau period was not significantly different (76 +/- 11 vs 78 +/- 11 bpm) between the ISRP and HCTZ groups. These reductions in BP were comparable to monotherapy with HCTZ. The mean reduction in diastolic BP with ISRP (17 +/- 6 mm Hg) was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than that with HCTZ (14 +/- 5 mm Hg). The mean doses for ISRP and HCTZ were 12 mg/day and 60 mg/day, respectively. There was no significant difference in frequency of common side effects (headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, palpitations) between the two groups. However, transient or intermittent peripheral edema occurred more frequently in ISRP group. Four patients in ISRP group (two due to edema and two due to palpitations) and two patients in HCTZ group (due to poor BP control) were discontinued from the study. Our results indicate that ISRP in doses of 5 to 10 mg bid is as effective as HCTZ as monotherapy in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.\r"

Unfortunately, because of the unknown structure and lack of biochemical characterization, some discrepancies have arisen. In this study we report a method to obtain extracts from human plasma that are able to inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase in vitro. Preliminary characterization was carried out, which showed that the extracts are able to inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase, pNPPase, and [3H]ouabain binding to red blood cells. The enzyme inhibition is not due to vanadate, FFA, or bivalent cations, and it seems to be reversible, dose-dependent, and largely prevented in E1 conformation of the enzyme. These results seem to support the hypothesis that human plasma contains a sodium pump inhibitor with many characteristics of a \"ouabainlike\" compound.\r"

An average of 10(6) cells per hypothalamus was obtained, and heat-treated (80 degrees C for 10 minutes) culture medium (120 ml) after lyophilization yielded 0.8 g of material. After Sephadex G-15 chromatography, 0.5 g of lyophilized medium from fetal hypothalamic neurons of spontaneously hypertensive rats yielded 254 +/- 47 arbitrarily defined units of Na+ + K+-ATPase inhibitory activity compared with 238 +/- 59 units from identical material of normotensive source.

The concentration at which the probability of no response was 0.5 (Cp50) for laryngoscopy was 356 ng ml-1, for opening the peritoneum 295 ng ml-1 and for closing the peritoneum 254 ng ml-1. The average Cp50 for the intra-abdominal part of the operation was 268 +/- 97 ng ml-1. The Cp50 for needing naloxone was 174 ng ml-1.

Adenosine produced an increase in cardiac output (CO), maintained blood flow to the cerebrum, cerebellum, heart, kidneys and adrenal glands and increased blood flow to the spinal cord and splanchnic organs, except the spleen. SNP and TNG decreased CO, but blood flow to the aforementioned organs (except the spleen) was maintained. Urine flow was greatly impaired during the infusion of adenosine.\r"

All patients had detectable levels of the serum antigen, which in its soluble nonreduced form appeared to be a 52-Kd homodimer as compared with the 66-Kd surface membrane component on most thymocytes and on a subset of functionally distinct T cells (suppressor/cytotoxic). Increased serum levels of CD8 in leukemia patients were significantly related to recognized high-risk prognostic features: high leukocyte count, large liver and spleen size, high serum lactic dehydrogenase level, T-cell immunophenotype, presence of a mediastinal mass, pseudodiploid karyotype, DNA index less than 1.16, and chromosomal translocation. Children with serum CD8 levels greater than or equal to 450 U/mL were more likely to fail treatment than were those with lower levels (P = .002), even in the group with non-T-cell leukemia (P = .003). In a multivariate analysis, serum CD8 antigen contributed independent prognostic information beyond that conveyed by age, leukocyte count, and race (P = .02). High serum CD8 antigen levels also correlated with advanced stages of disease in children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or B-cell leukemia. Children with higher serum CD8 antigen levels (greater than or equal to 700 U/mL) had a poorer treatment outcome (P = .003), even after results were adjusted for disease stage and serum lactic dehydrogenase level (P = .05). Measurement of serum levels of CD8 antigen not only has important prognostic value in childhood lymphoid malignancies but also could be useful in assessing the immunoregulatory role of T cells in patients with cancer.\r"

  ".U": "88327107\r", 
  ".W": "Hemophilia A is caused by a defect in coagulation factor VIII, a protein that undergoes extensive proteolysis during its activation and inactivation. To determine whether some cases of hemophilia are caused by mutations in important cleavage sites, we screened patient DNA samples for mutations in these sites by a two-step process. Regions of interest were amplified from genomic DNA by repeated rounds of primer-directed DNA synthesis. The amplified DNAs were then screened for mutations by discriminant hybridization using oligonucleotide probes. Two cleavage site mutations were found in a survey of 215 patients. A nonsense mutation in the activated protein C cleavage site at amino acid 336 was discovered in a patient with severe hemophilia. In another severely affected patient, a mis-sense mutation results in a substitution of cysteine for arginine in the thrombin activation site at amino acid 1689. This defect is associated with no detectable factor VIII activity, but with normal levels of factor VIII antigen. The severe hemophilia in this patient was sporadic; analysis of the mother suggested that the mutation originated in her gametes or during her embryogenesis. The results demonstrate that this approach can be used to identify factor VIII gene mutations in regions of the molecule known to be important for function.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of action responsible for the beneficial effect of alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) in patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is still unknown. Direct antineoplastic and immunomodulating effects on both the host immune system and the hairy cells themselves have been implicated. To evaluate whether lymphokines have any regulatory effect on antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on hairy cells and whether this corresponds to prognostic clinical parameters, we studied splenic hairy cells from ten previously untreated patients. The samples were incubated with recombinant human alpha-IFN, gamma-IFN (gamma-IFN), and interleukin-2 (IL-2). In an indirect staining procedure, cells were labeled with monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to HLA ABC and HLA DR surface structures and subjected to cytofluorimetric analysis. Results concerning the expression of MHC class I and HLA DR antigens were mixed for incubation of hairy cells with gamma-IFN and IL-2, whereas alpha-IFN had a distinct effect on HLA DR antigen expression. alpha-IFN strongly enhanced the intensity of staining with HLA DR MoAb in six patients, and it increased the percentage of MoAb-positive cells in five of these samples. In contrast, the staining intensity in samples from four patients was reduced considerably on alpha-IFN treatment. In this group, two samples showed a sharp alpha-IFN-induced decrease in the number of HLA DR MoAb-positive cells from originally high values, and in one sample the very low percentage of positive cells was unaffected by alpha-IFN exposure. These two groups of patients whose hairy cells displayed contrasting HLA DR expression on incubation with alpha-IFN in vitro, were found to differ in their subsequent clinical course.\r"

Previous work by the investigators has shown that IL-1 induced circulating CSF in normal mice and, when used after sublethal irradiation, accelerated the recovery of endogenous splenic colonies. Therefore, IL-1, as well as IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), G-CSF, and GM-CSF, were evaluated as potential therapeutic agents in irradiated C3H-HeN mice. A single intraperitoneal injection, administered within three hours after a lethal dose (LD)95/30 of irradiation that would kill 95% of mice within 30 days, protected in a dose-dependent manner up to 100% of mice from radiation-induced death due to hematopoietic syndrome. Significant therapeutic effects were also achieved with a single dose of IFN-gamma or of TNF. In contrast, GM-CSF and G-CSF, administered shortly after irradiation, had no effect in the doses used on mice survival.\r"

Only 5 micrograms of total cellular RNA is needed and the chimeric bcr/abl message can be detected at a dilution of 1:100,000. We also detected residual chimeric bcr/abl transcripts in the remission samples from two Ph1-positive CML patients. This technique has the potential to identify a subpopulation of Ph1-positive CML patients in remission who are at high risk of relapse.\r"

The time lapse from the last stimulus was up to 13 years. Mononuclear cells from immunized women were stimulated by Rh(D)-positive erythrocyte stroma. Maximum transformation was observed on the sixth day of culture, with a stroma protein concentration of 8 micrograms/mL of culture medium. The stimulation index (SI) in cells from 11 immunized women was 6.8 +/- 3.1 (mean +/- SD), with a range from 3.1 to 15.0. In five different sets of control cultures, the SI ranged from 0.9 +/- 0.2 to 1.3 +/- 0.4. There was no overlap between stimulated and control cultures. No anti-D could be demonstrated in the serum of four of the 11 immunized cases studied. Also, transformation was observed in mononuclear cells from Rh(D)-negative immunized women with Rh(D)-positive erythrocytes. The findings demonstrate that lymphocytes from isoimmunized Rh(D)-negative subjects maintain the immune memory and are transformed in vitro by the Rh(D) isoantigen.\r"

A total of three hundred and fifty-six patients undergoing total hip replacement were randomized into three groups and 316 patients were analysed. All thrombi were verified by ascending phlebography. One-third of the patients developed deep vein thrombosis in group A and B, differing significantly from group C. The operative blood loss in group B was higher than that in groups A and C. However, the number of patients transfused and their transfusion requirements did not differ. Severe bleeding occurred in one patient in each group. No deaths were registered during the study. Our study indicates that prophylactic treatment against postoperative deep vein thrombosis with low molecular weight heparin + dihydroergotamine once daily is as effective and safe as conventional low-dose heparin + dihydroergotamine twice daily in patients undergoing total hip replacement. The once-daily regimen has the advantage of better patient acceptance and less nursing time.\r"

DESIGN--Non-randomised cohort study of postmenopausal women treated with oral or depot oestrogens and postmenopausal controls. SETTING--Gynaecological endocrine clinic in tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS--Oral treatment group of 37 postmenopausal women (mean age 57.5 years, median 8.75 years from last menstrual period), compared with 41 women given oestrogen implants (mean age 56.2 years, median 9.5 years from last menstrual period) and 36 controls (mean age 51.8 years, median 2.0 years from last menstrual period). Weight was not significantly different among the groups. INTERVENTIONS--Oral treatment group was given continuous treatment with cyclic oestrogen and progesterone preparations (Prempak C or Cycloprogynova) for a median of 8.0 years. Implant group was given subcutaneous implants of oestradiol 50 mg combined with testosterone 100 mg, on average six monthly for a median of 8.5 years. Controls were not treated. END POINT--Significant increase in bone density. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Bone density measured by dual beam photon absorptiometry was 1.02 (SD 0.13) g hydroxyapatite/cm2 in implant group versus 0.89 (0.11) in oral group (p less than 0.01) and 0.87 (0.14) in controls (p less than 0.01). Serum oestradiol concentration in implant group was (median) 725 pmol/l versus 170 pmol/l in oral group (p less than 0.01) and 99 pmol/l in controls (p less than 0.01). Serum follicular stimulating hormone was median 1 IU/l (range 1-11) in implant group (equivalent to premenopausal values) versus 43 (4-94) IU/l in oral group (p less than 0.01) and 72 (28-99) IU/l in controls (p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS--Subcutaneous oestrogen is more effective than oral oestrogen in preventing osteoporosis, probably owing to the more physiological (premenopausal) serum oestradiol concentrations achieved. It also avoids problems of compliance that occur with oral treatment.\r"

  ".U": "88327429\r", 
  ".W": "Recombinant interferon alpha has now been established as having a distinct if narrow role when used as a single agent in cancer therapy. The responses to single-agent therapy can be grouped as shown in Table 7. Interferon is likely to be the treatment of choice for hairy cell leukemia and possibly also for symptomatic nodular lymphoma. Interferon is very useful in treating papillomas and condylomas, and its role as a local agent will probably expand. The list of responding cancers for alpha interferon or other subtypes as a single agent is unlikely to expand greatly over the next few years. Nevertheless, in both melanoma and renal carcinoma, meaningful responses do occur. It is important to be aware of the possibility of both delayed and increasing extent of response with duration of treatment; adequate trials of interferon may therefore require longer periods of treatment than does conventional chemotherapy. Furthermore, because prior failure to respond to chemotherapy does not predict response to interferon, its use as a second-line agent should also be considered. The future of such biological agents, however, clearly lies in combination with other agents as the \"fourth arm\" of cancer therapy. The challenge is to define what the role of that fourth arm will be. There seems to be a clear choice with the interferons. They can be used at pharmacological doses, in which case their antiproliferative effect is likely to be due to induction of certain enzymes that result in a cytostatic effect in susceptible cancers, of which there are a limited but therapeutically important number. Alternatively, the interferons can be used at physiological doses, which are more likely to cause immunological and cell membrane effects such as NK-cell stimulation, as well as Fc-receptor and tumor-antigen expression. Thus, combination with cytotoxic agents may well require high doses, whereas combination with other biological agents, such as monoclonal antibodies or LAK cells, may be most effective at much lower doses. Over the next few years it will be important to establish the optimal biological doses of the interferons, so that we can maximize their usefulness in therapy and avoid the trap of thinking of them as purely cytotoxic agents.\r"

  ".W": "Normal Swiss Webster mice were treated with monocrotaline or high doses of three antitumor alkylating agents (BCNU, cyclophosphamide, or mitomycin C), all of which have been connected with hepatic veno-occlusive disease at our clinic. Prior administration of WR-2721 did not improve the survival of monocrotaline-treated animals. Glutathione (GSH) improved the survival of these animals to a small degree. Glutathione monoethyl ester (GSHet) almost completely protected animals from the toxicity of monocrotaline. Pretreatment with WR-2721 produced moderate increases in survival at the highest doses of BCNU, and at the lower BCNU doses none of the animals pretreated with WR-2721 died before they were killed on day 150. Pretreatment with GSHet gave good protection from BCNU toxicity at the highest dose of the drug, and there were no deaths in the groups of animals treated with GSHet 1 hour before BCNU. On a multiple dose schedule, GSH provided some protection from cyclophosphamide toxicity; GSHet gave a very good level of protection from cyclophosphamide. In none of these treatment groups were lesions suggestive of hepatic or pulmonary venoocclusive disease identified. In all three experimental protocols (monocrotaline, BCNU, and cyclophosphamide), there was a consistent decrease in hepatic toxicity after GSHet pretreatment; this was not observed in GSH- or WR-2721-pretreated animals. There was no evidence of protection of the FSaIIC fibrosarcoma growing in C3H mice as assayed by tumor growth delay or tumor cell survival in groups treated with two different doses of GSHet 1 hour before each drug injection compared to those treated with the BCNU or cyclophosphamide alone, or BCNU with cyclophosphamide. Pretreatment with GSHet did not alter the toxicity of these drugs to bone marrow. GSHet appears to be an effective protector of critical normal tissue and does not appear to protect tumor.\r"

Patients with hydronephrosis who were treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy demonstrated a slight early improvement in renal function followed by a fall, in contrast to those treated with carboplatin-based chemotherapy in whom renal function improved. Patients with hydronephrosis who showed no improvement in glomerular filtration rate after the first course of chemotherapy were at an increased risk of renal atrophy and chronic renal damage developing. Long-term renal toxicity may be avoided in these patients either by the use of carboplatin or by the use of drainage procedures such as ureteric stenting or nephrostomy.\r"

Retrospective, uncontrolled comparison before and after the acquisition of a home nebulizer showed significant decreases both in hospital admissions (1.7 vs 0.7; p less than 0.001) and total in-patient days (4.1 vs 1.7; p less than 0.0001).

  ".W": "After 20 mg sublingual nifedipine in 12 men with clinical stable chronic cor pulmonale the mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance fell, cardiac index rose, and mean pulmonary arterial (Ppa) and wedge (Ppaw) pressures, right atrial pressure, and PaO2 remained unchanged. After 20 mg orally every 6 hours for 24 hours in 11 patients, the mean arterial pressure fell further, systemic vascular resistance remained low, and the cardiac index returned to baseline, whereas the Ppa and Ppaw decreased, but the pulmonary vascular driving pressure (Ppa-Ppaw), right atrial pressure, PaO2, and spirometry and ejection fractions remained unchanged. Of eight patients receiving maintenance therapy four developed untoward side effects in 1 to 3 weeks and one was noncompliant. The remaining three patients evaluated at 6 weeks failed to improve and had unchanged resting hemodynamics. Thus in the absence of a potentially reversible hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, nifedipine may not improve pulmonary arterial pressure and cardiac function in clinically stable patients with cor pulmonale.\r"

Plasma drug concentrations, subjective self-ratings, and the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) were evaluated during 24 hours after dosage. Alprazolam was absorbed rapidly and produced correspondingly rapid sedation and impaired DSST performance. These effects also resolved rapidly, being similar to placebo by 4 to 6 hours after dosage. Sedative and DSST-impairing effects of lorazepam were of slower onset but longer duration than those of alprazolam. After oral prazepam, appearance of desmethyldiazepam in plasma was slow, with minimal sedative and DSST-impairing effects. Twenty-four hours after dosage, both alprazolam and lorazepam significantly impaired recall of a list of 16 words learned previously 3 hours after dosage. Thus benzodiazepines with approximately equivalent clinical anxiolytic properties may have different sedative, performance-impairing, and amnesic profiles after single doses in healthy volunteers; these differences are explained at least in part by pharmacokinetic variations.\r"

Vamin 14 infusion increased whole-body leucine flux (P less than 0.001), leucine employed for protein synthesis (P less than 0.001), leucine oxidation (P less than 0.001), metabolic clearance rate of alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (P less than 0.05) and levels of all three branched-chain amino acids (P less than 0.001) compared with the basal situation. In contrast, whole-body proteolysis was reduced (P less than 0.05). 3. Resting metabolic rate was increased during Vamin 14 infusion (P less than 0.05) and was positively correlated with whole-body protein synthesis (n = 16, r = 0.6342, P less than 0.01; y = 0.605x + 173.7), as was the change in metabolic rate with the change in protein synthesis (n = 8, r = 0.772, P less than 0.05; y = 0.493x - 10.85). 4.

These data lend a measure of support to the hypothesis that the apparent increase in whole-body protein synthesis in insulin-dependent diabetic (type I) subjects during insulin withdrawal may be substrate related.\r"

In order to examine the potential role of endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in modulating the increased sodium excretion per nephron in chronic renal failure, we studied healthy subjects with normal renal function (group I) and patients with moderate (group II) or severe chronic renal failure (group III) before, during and after administration of an intravenous sodium load. All subjects had been on a controlled diet containing 120 mmol of sodium per day for 5 days before the study. 2. Under basal conditions, plasma ANP and fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) were highest in group III. Both parameters increased in response to the sodium load in the three groups studied (P less than 0.001). Changes with time differed from group to group (P less than 0.05), the more marked response for both parameters being observed in group III. After adjustment with respect to plasma ANP (analysis of covariance), FENa was no longer modified in response to the sodium load, whereas adjustment of FENa with respect to mean blood pressure was without consequence on the significance of its change with time. This demonstrates that plasma ANP, but not mean blood pressure, represents the main factor producing variation in FENa during and after the sodium load. 3. These results suggest an important role for plasma ANP in promoting adaptation of short-term sodium excretion in response to an acute sodium load in patients with chronic renal failure who ingest a normal sodium intake.\r"

We have previously shown that the ratio (RWBP) of incorporation of label from 2-ketoisocaproate (KIC) into the leucine of whole-body protein to the simultaneous incorporation of label from leucine itself into protein is a measure of the nutritional efficiency of KIC as a substitute for leucine. 2. In order to determine whether RWBP can be estimated indirectly from measurement of labelled CO2 excretion, rats were injected orally or intravenously with [4,5-3H]leucine and either [1-14C]leucine or [1-14C]KIC. Expired CO2 was collected for 6 h. 3. The results show that 9-14% of KIC underwent first-pass oxidation after oral administration. When isotopes were given intravenously, the mean rate of excretion of 14CO2 from KIC, after 20 min, remained 1.8 times the mean rate of excretion of 14CO2 from leucine. 4. Mean RWBP, measured in whole-body protein in rats given isotopes orally or intravenously along with small or large doses of carriers, was the same as mean RWBP estimated from mean cumulative CO2 excretion. 5. We conclude (1) that nutritional efficiency of KIC relative to leucine can be estimated from measurement of labelled CO2 excretion, and (2) that the relative inefficiency of KIC as a substitute for leucine in the rat is attributable to first-pass oxidation of 9-14% (when given orally) and 80% greater susceptibility to systemic oxidation than leucine.\r"

The renin concentration was two orders of magnitude lower in urine than in plasma, but it increased after intraperitoneal injection of submandibular mouse renin. No correlation between the plasma renin concentration and the urinary renin concentration and renin excretion rate could be demonstrated. 3. Blockade of the tubular reabsorption of proteins by intraperitoneal injection of the basic amino acid lysine increased the urinary renin concentration, renin excretion rate and renin clearance two to three orders of magnitude, without affecting the plasma renin concentration. 4. This finding demonstrates that ultrafiltered renin is reabsorbed almost completely in the renal tubules and that the mechanism most likely is the same as for other filtered proteins. 5. The large renal renin clearance obtained after intraperitoneal lysine is in accordance with a major role of the kidneys in the elimination of renin from the circulation, by a glomerular ultrafiltration and tubular reabsorption and metabolization of renin.\r"

Cutaneous disease was reported in apprentices, active embalmers and inactive embalmers in decreasing order of frequency. Positive patch test reactions to formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde were found in 4% and 7% of the exposed workers, but in none of the controls. Although exposure to glutaraldehyde was less frequent, the prevalence of positive patch test reactions did not differ.

We studied the capacity of this formulation to repeatedly block the GH secretion induced by administration of GRF-(1-29)NH2 (GRF) on different days. Male rats anesthetized with pentobarbital were injected iv with 2.5 micrograms/kg BW GRF-(1-29)NH2 or saline. Five minutes later, blood samples were taken for GH measurement, and the animals were injected im with RC-160 microcapsules at a dose calculated to release 25 micrograms/day of the analog for 7 days or with the vehicle. The GRF stimuli were repeated 48 h, 96 h, and 8 days after administration of SS analog in microcapsules. GRF administration increased GH levels at the four times tested (P less than 0.01) in the control group injected with vehicle, while RC-160 microcapsules inhibited the GH response for more than 96 h (P less than 0.01). The GH levels augmented by pentobarbital were also decreased by the RC-160 microcapsules (P less than 0.01). Animals treated with microcapsules showed smaller increases in their body weight than untreated rats (P less than 0.05). We also investigated the effect of RC-160 microcapsules on hyperprolactinemic female rats implanted with pituitary glands under the kidney capsules. High PRL levels in rats bearing pituitary grafts showed a significant decrease when measured 4 days after the administration of RC-160 microcapsules. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the long-acting delivery system of the SS analog RC-160 and suggest the possible clinical usefulness of this formulation for lowering GH and PRL levels.\r"

  ".W": "It has been postulated that fetal hormonal signals act upon amnion to trigger labor via prostaglandin (PG) production. Human amnion epithelial cell cultures were established to test the effects of potential activators of the inositol phospholipid-protein kinase-C effector system on intracellular inositol phosphate turnover, intracellular free calcium ([ Ca2+]i), and PGE2 production. Oxytocin provoked 3-, 2.5-, and 4-fold increases in inositol triphosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol monophosphate, respectively. [Ca2+]i, measured with the fluorescent dye fura-2, was stimulated by oxytocin and vasopressin (oxytocin greater than vasopressin) in a dose-dependent manner. The [Ca2+]i transient produced by oxytocin reached a peak in 15 sec, followed by a slow return to baseline over 10 min. Preincubation with phorbol 12-myristate-13 acetate (PMA) markedly blunted the oxytocin-induced transient. No [Ca2+]i transient was seen with leukotrienes, PG, serotonin, angiotensin, or alpha- or beta-adrenergic agents. PGE2 production increased 30- to 50-fold with phospholipase-C and PMA, and 10-fold with the calcium ionophore A23187. Oxytocin and vasopressin produced 10- and 3-fold PGE2 increases, respectively. Increased PGE2 production induced by PMA, oxytocin, and A23187 was first seen after 8 hr of incubation and reached maximal levels at 24 h. Minimal PGE2 stimulation occurred with agents that produced no [Ca2+]i transient. Direct activators of the inositol phospholipid-protein kinase-C system in human amnion induce large increases in PGE2 in human amnion cells. Oxytocin and vasopressin are hormonal activators of this system in these cells, as demonstrated by their effects on inositol phosphate turnover and [Ca2+]i. These hormones also increase PGE2 production and may influence labor by stimulating PGE2 production in amnion through the inositol phospholipid-protein kinase-C system.\r"

  ".U": "88328939\r", 
  ".W": "Sex steroid-binding protein (SBP) is a plasma glycoprotein which, in man and many other mammals, binds significant amounts of circulating testosterone (T) with high affinity. To evaluate the effects of T binding by SBP on the control of reproductive function in males, SBP was purified from human plasma and administered by chronic infusion to castrated T-treated rats, animals that lack endogenous SBP. Plasma T concentrations in males implanted with 20-mm T capsules and infused with vehicle for 48 h were maintained at 1.37 +/- 0.14 ng/ml, and plasma LH and FSH concentrations remained at intact levels. Castrates implanted with identical T capsules but infused with human (h) SBP at a rate that produced a steady state plasma hSBP concentration of 75 nM, had markedly higher plasma T concentrations (3.44 +/- 0.32 ng/ml); however, circulating LH and FSH concentrations were not significantly different from those of the vehicle-infused controls. Similarly, the pituitary LH response to a bolus injection of LHRH was not affected by hSBP infusions. Measurements of tissue concentrations of T, dihydrotestosterone, and 3 alpha-androstanediol in the ventral prostate and seminal vesicles, as well as the weights of these organs, failed to reveal any effects of hSBP infusions on the uptake, metabolism, or action of T. Analysis of T distribution in plasma showed that the hSBP infusions produced marked increases in total plasma T levels but resulted in only marginal reduction in the concentration of T not bound to hSBP. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that T not bound to SBP is the major feedback-effective moiety and that under conditions of constant release of T into the circulation, an increase in plasma T binding by SBP increases the total plasma T concentration but does not appear to significantly alter the feedback-effective levels of T in the circulation. Therefore, it would appear that moderate changes in the amount of high affinity binding of T in the circulation would have little, if any, effect on androgen balance in adult males.\r"

  ".U": "88328940\r", 
  ".W": "The role of calcium ion mobilization in modulation of secretion of the ovarian protein hormone relaxin by porcine luteal cells was examined by use of a reverse hemolytic plaque assay. In this assay, luteal cells were cocultured in monolayers with protein-A-coupled ovine erythrocytes. In the presence of porcine relaxin antiserum and complement, a zone of hemolysis, a plaque, developed around relaxin-releasing luteal cells. The rate of development of plaques in time-course experiments was used in this study as an index of the rate of relaxin release. Exposure of luteal cell-containing monolayers to the calcium-mobilizing agent A23187 (40 nM to 5 microM) resulted in a dose-related increase in the rate of relaxin-plaque formation. This effect [and the influence of a stimulatory secretagogue, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; 1 microM)] was suppressed by coculture with Co2+ (5 mM), a calcium channel blocker. These results are consistent with the view that calcium ion redistribution within porcine luteal cells forms a pathway that subserves, at least in part, the rates of basal and stimulated relaxin release in vitro. However, A23187 was equally effective in enhancing the rate of plaque formation when the monolayers were bathed in a low calcium medium (mean +/- SEM, 6.61 +/- 0.92 microM Ca2+), rather than a calcium-replete medium (1.56 +/- 0.09 mM Ca2+). Likewise, neither basal nor PGE2-stimulated (1 microM) relaxin secretion was abrogated by culture of monolayers in low calcium medium. These data suggest that the stimulatory effect of A23187 (and perhaps PGE2) arose predominantly through redistribution of calcium stored within intracellular sites in luteal cells, rather than entrance of calcium into the cell from the extracellular medium. Yet, incompatible with this interpretation, we observed that TMB-8 [8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride; a putative inhibitor of intracellular calcium redistribution] enhanced rather than blocked A23187- or PGE2-stimulated relaxin release. This result is consistent with the possibility that TMB-8 mobilized (rather than blocked) calcium in this cell system or that it acted via calcium-independent mechanisms. We conclude that calcium mobilization has the potential to act as a molecular pathway that transduces secretion of an ovarian peptide hormone, relaxin. However, the exact nature and physiological role(s) of the Ca2+ pathway in the control of relaxin secretion and the interrelationships of this mechanism with other intracellular messengers that may also modulate ovarian peptide secretion remain to be more clearly defined.\r"

We studied the following three models on GRF secretion: 1) pulsatile GRF secreted at 1-h intervals, 2) pulsatile GRF secreted at 3-h intervals, and 3) GRF continuously secreted. When 5-min pulses of 20 nM GRF were delivered at 1-h intervals, the responses to GRF gradually declined. The addition of continuous 20 nM SRIF with short pauses prevented this attenuated response and produced high peaks of GH at 3-h intervals. When 5-min pulses of 20 nM GRF were delivered at 3-h intervals, three high peaks of GH were observed regardless of the addition of SRIF. Pretreatment with GRF pulses enhanced the peaks of GH during SRIF pauses. When 20 nM GRF was continuously delivered, a rapid attenuated response to GRF was observed. Although the addition of continuous 20 nM SRIF with short pauses produced three small peaks of GH, these results were caused by the post-SRIF rebound release. These observations suggest that preexposure to prolonged SRIF can prevent an attenuated response to repeated GRF pulses, and that pretreatment with GRF pulses enhances post-SRIF rebound release.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) preparations to potentiate FSH-mediated LH receptor induction in rat granulosa cell cultures was shown to be due to a component distinct from PDGF. Purification of heat-treated platelet lysate by carboxymethyl-Sephadex C-50 and Cibacron blue-Sepharose chromatography, followed by Bio-Gel P-60 chromatography, resulted in the separation of two activities: 1) a growth-promoting activity, P60-PDGF, defined on the basis of increased DNA synthesis in BALB/c-3T3 cells, and 2) a differentiation-promoting activity which enhanced FSH-dependent LH receptor induction in granulosa cells. On the basis of electrophoretic mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, inhibition of tritiated thymidine uptake by epithelial cells, and attenuation of LH/hCG receptor expression in the presence of antitransforming growth factor-beta (anti-TGF beta) immunoglobulin G, the differentiation-promoting component of the preparations appears to be TGF beta. The Bio-Gel fractions that contained TGF beta did not stimulate LH receptor induction of cAMP production in the absence of FSH. PDGF prepared free of TGF beta did not potentiate receptor induction. We conclude, therefore, that the differentiative effects of PDGF previously described in this system are due to TGF beta.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that FSH modulates the Ca++-, phospholipid-dependent pathway was studied in cultured rat Sertoli cells. Cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]myoinositol, and accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates [( 3H]inositol mono-, di-, and trisphosphates) was measured by extraction and fractionation on ion exchange chromatography. Fetal bovine serum increased Sertoli cell phosphoinositide (PI) turnover in a time and concentration-dependent manner (ED50 = 2-3% vol/vol). FSH by itself had no significant effect on the accumulation of inositol phosphates. On the other hand, FSH inhibited, in a concentration-dependent manner, the serum-stimulated accumulation of inositol phosphates by more than 50%. HPLC ion exchange chromatography of the inositol phosphates showed that all isomers present in serum-stimulated extracts were reduced to the same extent after treatment with FSH. The treatment of the cells with either forskolin, the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, or (Bu)2cAMP also inhibited the PI turnover stimulated by fetal bovine serum. FSH inhibition was not detected in mature Sertoli cells, in which FSH no longer stimulates cAMP accumulation. These results demonstrate that FSH, via formation of cAMP, exerts inhibitory effects on the PI turnover of the Sertoli cell. Thus, while stimulating the cAMP-dependent pathway, at the same time FSH inhibits the Ca++-, phospholipid-dependent pathway.\r"

  ".U": "88328963\r", 
  ".W": "Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is stored in atrial myocytes as a 15-17K prohormone, but circulates in plasma as a 3K, carboxy (C)-terminal fragment of the prohormone. The tissue location at which the cleavage of pro-ANF to its hormonal form occurs is unknown. In the present study, an immunological approach was taken to address this question. A polyclonal antiserum was generated which recognizes the hormonal form of ANF [ANF-(99-126)] only after its cleavage from the prohormone. This was accomplished by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the seven amino (N)-terminal residues of ANF-(99-126) coupled to carrier protein via a C-terminal cysteine. This antiserum, anti-ANF-(99-105), demonstrated high affinity for ANF-(99-126) (IC50 = 170 pM), but displayed 100-fold less affinity for recombinant pro-ANF [ANF-(2-126)]. The N-terminal specificity of anti-ANF-(99-105) was evident by its failure to bind ANF-(103-126) at concentrations up to 100 nM. The specificity of anti-ANF-(99-105) for the hormonal form of ANF was examined by using thrombin to cleave pro-ANF and testing for the generation of anti-ANF-(99-105) immunoreactivity. Cleavage of atrial pro-ANF or 35S biosynthetically-labeled pro-ANF resulted in the production of immunoreactive material from the prohormone, whereas pro-ANF itself demonstrated no cross-reactivity with anti-ANF-(99-105). Anti-ANF-(99-105) could also recognize ANF released from the isolated perfused rat heart. When anti-ANF-(99-105) was used in immunohistochemical studies of rat atrial myocardium, no staining was observed in unfixed frozen sections. This suggests that proteolytic processing of pro-ANF is not an intracardiocytic event.\r"

Twenty-two-week gestation, histologically confirmed, human fetal thyroid was collagenase digested, cultured as a monolayer, and infected directly with 12S or 13S E1A-containing retrovirus constructs. Infected clones (n = 30) were selected in a hormone-supplemented medium containing bovine TSH (bTSH; 1 mU/ml), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5 mg/ml G418 antibiotic. A rapidly growing clone (designated 12S) was chosen for detailed analysis over 18 months of continuous culture. The 12S clone was sensitive to less than 10 microU/ml bTSH when assessed by extracellular accumulation of cAMP, but TSH had no influence on 72-h incorporation of [3H]thymidine. Clone 12S responded to recombinant human gamma-interferon (1-10(4) U/ml) by induction of HLA DR alpha-chain-specific mRNA and the surface expression of HLA-DR antigen detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody to nonpolymorphic HLA-DR regions using flow cytometry. These studies indicate the potential for immortalizing human thyroid cells for use as targets of anti-TSH receptor immune responses and for long term studies of human throcyte HLA gene regulation.\r"

Sertoli cells were also used to measure apical efflux of 86Rb+ by loading the cells with the isotope to steady state and then incubating cells so that the apical surfaces were in contact with medium not containing 86Rb+, from which samples were taken. Basal efflux was measured in the same way except that the opposite surface of the cells was in contact with the medium. Cells grown on filters treated with collagen IV plus fibronectin showed transcellular transport of 86Rb+; t1/2 for equilibration across the cells was 9-12 min. The rate of transport was accelerated by addition of (Bu)2cAMP, forskolin, or FSH to the incubation medium. Half-maximal responses were seen with (Bu)2cAMP at 0.2 mM and with forskolin at 20 microM. Apical efflux (t1/2 9.8 +/- 2.1 min) was not influenced by the presence or absence of K+ in the medium nor by azide or (Bu)2cAMP. Basal efflux showed similar values for t1/2 in the presence of K+ (9.7 +/- 1.9 min) and values of 21.4 +/- 4.2 min in the absence of K+. Vectorial transport of 86Rb+ by these cells may account for the K+ gradient seen in the seminiferous tubule and appears to result from a basolateral potassium pump together with an apical membrane that is permeable to K+.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the role of peritubular cell-Sertoli cell interactions in the control of Sertoli cell function by androgens. Decreased FSH-inducible aromatase activity and increased secretion of androgen-binding protein (ABP) were used as parameters of androgen action on Sertoli cells. It is demonstrated that coculturing Sertoli cells with limited amounts of peritubular cells (20%) has only marginal effects on inducible aromatase activity or ABP secretion, but markedly increases the response of these parameters to androgens. Conditioned media derived from peritubular cells pretreated with androgens mimick the effects observed in the coculture system. Evidence is presented that androgen action on peritubular cells is mediated by an androgen receptor and that the concentration of this receptor is increased up to 3-fold by androgens. Preliminary experiments suggest some analogy between the peritubular cell factors that stimulate ABP production and those that inhibit aromatase induction. The active principles responsible for both activities are thermolabile trypsine-sensitive proteins with a mol wt between 50,000-100,000, and androgen induction by both activities shows an identical time course, characterized by a 4-day latent period. Nonetheless, much higher concentrations of peritubular cell secretion products seem to be required to inhibit aromatase induction than to stimulate ABP production, indicating that the active principles are not necessarily identical. It is concluded that peritubular cell secretion products mimick and mediate not only stimulatory but also inhibitory effects of androgens on Sertoli cells.\r"

  ".W": "Agonist analogs of GnRH, after an initial period of stimulation, down-regulate gonadotropin secretion in both man and experimental animals. To study the pretranslational changes in LH subunits during GnRH agonist (GnRH-A) treatment in vivo, 55-day-old male Wistar rats were divided into two groups as follows: 1) sham operated, and 2) testosterone (T)-replaced castrated animals. T replacement was given by 20-mm T implants. Each group was subdivided into two subgroups to receive either saline or 1 microgram GnRH-A (D-Leu6,Des,Gly10-GnRH Net) by daily sc injection. Pituitaries were harvested after 1, 7, and 28 days of GnRH-A treatment for measurements of LH subunit mRNAs by dot hybridization assay. Serum LH concentrations were measured by a RIA. In intact animals, serum LH concentrations, measured 24 h after the GnRH-A injection, were higher in the GnRH-A group than in saline controls on day 1, but not on days 7 and 28. However, alpha and LH beta mRNA levels were higher in the GnRH-A-treated animals than in saline controls only on day 28, but not on days 1 and 7, however, in T-replaced castrated rats, in which testicular feedback to the pituitary was clamped by orchiectomy and replacement with a fixed dose of exogenous T, GnRH-A decreased serum LH and LH beta mRNA levels compared to those in saline controls. alpha mRNA levels were, however, not different between GnRH-A- and saline-treated animals at any time. We conclude that 1) an early increase in serum LH after 1 day of GnRH-A treatment probably reflects the release of preformed LH rather than increased synthesis; 2) in T-replaced castrated animals where the testicular feedback is clamped, GnRH-A-induced down-regulation of LH can be explained by a decrease in LH beta mRNA; and 3) differences in the LH subunit responses of intact and T-replaced castrated animals provide further evidence for testicular modulation of the LH response to GnRH-A.\r"

  ".W": "Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), pituitary FSH content and FSH beta subunit mRNA concentrations were measured at 1 to 3h intervals throughout the 4 day estrous cycle in rats. Serum FSH was stable (range 200-320 ng/ml) apart from the biphasic proestrus surge (5 fold elevation) which was present from 1800 h of proestrus through 0800 h on estrus. Basal FSH beta mRNA concentrations from late metestrus through the afternoon of proestrus were 0.10 +/- 0.04 f mol cDNA bound/100 micrograms pituitary DNA. The major increase in FSH beta mRNA began at 2000 h on proestrus, 2 h after the initial rise in serum FSH and peak mRNA concentrations (0.43 +/- 0.08 f mol cDNA bound) occurred at 0200 h on estrus. FSH beta subunit mRNA concentrations were again increased at 2300 h on estrus (peak 0.24 f mol cDNA bound) and remained elevated through 1700 h on metestrus. Pituitary FSH content was transiently increased during metestrus and diestrus, but was elevated at 1000 h through 1900 h on proestrus (peak 5-fold increase). FSH content fell rapidly at 2000 h and remained low until 1400 h on estrus when values again rose. These data show that FSH beta mRNA is increased 4-5 fold during the proestrus FSH surge, and a smaller increase occurs on metestrus in the absence of elevated FSH secretion. The increased concentrations of FSH beta mRNA occurred at different times to the previously reported changes in alpha and LH beta mRNAs. Therefore, the data suggest that different mechanisms are involved in the regulation of LH and FSH beta subunit gene expression during the 4-day estrous cycle in rats.\r"

Glycosaminoglycans were isolated from GBM purified from control, streptozocin-induced diabetic, and sorbinil-treated diabetic rats and analyzed for sulfate and uronate content. Glomerular yields from diabetic kidneys were greater than those from control animals, but the amount of sulfate per glomerulus in diabetic samples, both untreated and sorbinil treated, did not differ significantly from that in control samples. However, the sulfate-to-uronate ratio in heparan sulfate isolated from diabetic GBM (0.34 +/- 0.08) was significantly less than in control samples (0.69 +/- 0.11), and treatment of diabetic rats with an aldose reductase inhibitor did not correct this reduced ratio (0.36 +/- 0.06). The results indicate that there is an undersulfation of heparan sulfate of GBM in experimental diabetes, an abnormality that may contribute to loss of anionic sites and decreased charge selectivity of the glomerular filtration barrier. The findings further suggest that this abnormality results from disturbances in glycosaminoglycan synthesis and/or metabolism in diabetes that are independent of polyol-pathway activation in the renal glomerulus.\r"

Our data confirm that sciatic nerve Na+-K+-ATPase abnormalities are present very early in ALX-D rats, similar to results previously described in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats, spontaneously diabetic BB Wistar rats, and ALX-D rabbits. Na+-K+-ATPase activity decreased by 26-47% in ALX-D rats compared with age-matched controls. Ganglioside treatment (10 mg/kg i.p. for 10 or 30 days starting 1 wk after ALX injection) completely impeded the enzyme reduction. The effect observed at the end of either 10 or 30 days of treatment lasted greater than or equal to 1 mo. Chronic diabetic groups treated for 30 days before killing also presented normal ATPase activity at the end of treatment. Therefore, gangliosides are effective on Na+-K+-ATPase even in animals with a longer duration of diabetes. The maintenance of fairly normal ATPase activity by ganglioside treatment could mirror a more general recovery from early metabolic dysfunction and/or late structural abnormalities in diabetic nerve fibers.\r"

In an in vivo transplantation system in which islet grafts were made in the presence or absence of the BDC-2.5 T-lymphocytes, it was found that incorporation of the islet-specific T-lymphocytes into the graft site resulted in complete destruction of the transplanted tissue.

We measured bile acid synthesis as release of 14CO2 from [26-14C]cholesterol every 2 hr in three normal volunteers during five separate 24-hr periods. Data were fitted by computer to a cosine curve to estimate amplitude and acrophase of the circadian rhythm. In an additional six volunteers, we measured synthesis every 2 hr from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. only. During the control period, amplitude (expressed as percentage of mean synthesis) averaged 52% and acrophase averaged 6:49 a.m. During administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (15 mg per kg per day), synthesis averaged 126% of baseline (p less than 0.1), amplitude averaged 43% and acrophase averaged 6:20 a.m. During administration of chenodeoxycholic acid (15 mg per kg per day), synthesis averaged 43% of baseline (p less than 0.001), amplitude averaged 53% and acrophase averaged 9:04 a.m. Addition of prednisone to this regimen of chenodeoxycholic acid to eliminate release of 14CO2 from corticosteroid hormone synthesis resulted in a mean amplitude of 62% and a mean acrophase of 6:50 a.m., values very similar to those in the baseline period. Administration of prednisone alone also did not significantly alter the baseline amplitude (40%) or acrophase (6:28 a.m.). We conclude that neither chenodeoxycholic acid nor ursodeoxycholic acid significantly alters the circadian rhythm of bile acid synthesis in man.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88329957\r", 
  ".W": "Renal sodium and water retention and plasma volume expansion have been shown to precede ascites formation in experimental cirrhosis. The classical \"underfilling\" theory, in which ascites formation causes hypovolemia and initiates secondary renal sodium and water retention, thus seems unlikely. While the occurrence of primary renal sodium and water retention and plasma volume expansion prior to ascites formation favors the \"overflow\" hypothesis, the stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, vasopressin release and sympathetic nervous system associated with cirrhosis is not consonant with primary volume expansion. In this present article, the \"Peripheral Arterial Vasodilation Hypothesis\" is proposed as the initiator of sodium and water retention in cirrhosis. Peripheral arterial vasodilation is one of the earliest observations in the cirrhotic patient and experimental animals with cirrhosis. Arterial vasodilators and arteriovenous fistula are other examples in which renal sodium and water retention occur secondary to a decreased filling of the arterial vascular tree. An increase in cardiac output and hormonal stimulation are common features of cirrhosis, arteriovenous fistula and drug-induced peripheral arterial vasodilation. However, a predilection for the retained sodium and water to transudate into the abdominal cavity occurs with cirrhosis because of the presence of portal hypertension. The Peripheral Arterial Vasodilation Hypothesis also explains the continuum from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis to the hepatorenal syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Hospital administrators, nurses, and physicians must strive to improve efficiency as new payment systems constrain health care spending. Our purpose in this project was to confirm the hypothesis that four clinical variables (emergency or intensive care unit [ICU] admission, and blood or plasma product use) could predict hospital costs and outcome for adult patients with hypertension. We analyzed hospital costs (exclusive of physician fees) for all patients with either a primary or secondary diagnosis of hypertension (N = 4289) receiving treatment during a 2-year period at an academic medical center. In addition to predicting outcome (i.e., whether the patient lived or died), these four clinical variables predicted differences in hospital cost per patient, and financial risk per Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) as measured by percentage of \"outliers\" (patients whose length of stay exceeds the cutoff point) or profit/loss per patient under DRG prospective hospital payment. The cost and predictive effect on cost and mortality of the variables were also cumulative; patients with hypertension with one variable had two times the cost of patients with no variables; patients with hypertension with two variables, 2.2 times the cost; patients with three variables, 4.3 times; and patients with four variables, 6.8 times. The mortality of patients with no variables was 0.8%; one variable, 7.7%; two variables, 12.7%; three variables, 15.7%; and four variables, 25.8%. Patients with hypertension can thus be stratified by cost and outcome by clinical events that occur during the patient's hospital stay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence of heterotopic ossification in the eighteen irradiated limbs was much lower than in the twenty patients who comprised the control group (50 per cent compared with 90 per cent). Only two of the irradiated limbs had Class-3 heterotopic ossification as described by Brooker et al., and no patient had Class-4 (ankylosis of the hip). Of the twenty control-group patients, ten had severe heterotopic ossification: Class 3 in seven and Class 4 in three. The difference in the incidence of severe (Class-3 or 4) heterotopic ossification between the two groups of patients was significant (p less than 0.01).\r"

In this study, seven New Zealand-specific pathogen-free male rabbits were inflicted with a burn to 27% of the total body surface area; another seven rabbits underwent a sham procedure. Plasma triglyceride levels rose markedly in the thermally injured group, and the hypertriglyceridemia persisted for ten days. Total plasma apolipoprotein B levels increased markedly by three days postburn and remained elevated for a period longer than the hypertriglyceridemia. In contrast, apolipoprotein E levels slowly increased, reaching a peak by day 10, and declined thereafter. Plasma levels of apolipoprotein A-I increased rapidly and remained elevated for two months. Thus, hypertriglyceridemia and concomitant changes in levels of apolipoproteins B, E, and A-I could be induced in rabbits by thermal injury. Plasma triglyceride levels were elevated for some time and then returned to normal, whereas apolipoprotein levels remained elevated for a longer time. These abnormalities may impair normal lipid transport in the postburn phase.\r"

Serum testosterone and estradiol, basal LH, and the LH response to GnRH were measured before and at the end of each treatment period, until maximal suppression of estradiol and testosterone occurred. Leuprolide was then continued for a total of 6 months to assess its clinical efficacy. Hirsutism scores and hair growth rates were determined before and after therapy. Serum estradiol and the LH response to GnRH were maximally or near-maximally suppressed in all women by the lowest doses of leuprolide used. Basal serum LH was not maximally suppressed in all women until a dose of 15 micrograms/kg.day was reached, and maximal testosterone suppression required 15 micrograms/kg.day or more in 7 of the 10 women. The addition of 0.5 mg dexamethasone daily for 4 weeks at the end of the study in 5 of the women reduced serum testosterone to undetectable levels. Symptomatic improvement in hirsutism occurred in 9 women, hirsutism scores decreased by at least 3 points in 5 women, and hair growth rates decreased in 8 women. These data indicate that low doses of leuprolide were sufficient to maximally suppress serum estradiol and the LH response to exogenous GnRH. Higher leuprolide doses were needed to maximally suppress serum testosterone and the basal LH levels. Leuprolide (20 micrograms/kg.day) effectively reduced hair growth in the majority of these women.\r"

Serum inhibin concentrations were strongly correlated with age and serum FSH, LH, testosterone, and estradiol; all hormones increased in parallel in both boys and girls. After adjustment for age, the partial correlation coefficients remained significant only for testosterone in the boys.

  ".W": "While compelling evidence indicates a pivotal role for endogenous opioids in the regulation of GnRH-LH pulsatile activity during the late follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, the participation, if any, of the opioidergic mechanism in the initiation of the midcycle surge has not been examined. Accordingly, we measured serum LH, FSH, estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) levels daily during 2 consecutive cycles in 12 normal cycling women. After a control cycle, each woman was infused with naloxone (30 micrograms/kg.h) for 24 h starting 3 days before the anticipated spontaneous midcycle surge. Blood samples were obtained at 15-min intervals for 8 h before, during, and 16 h after the naloxone infusion. Serum LH and FSH concentrations were measured in all samples, and serum E2 and P4 concentrations at 2-h intervals. Pulsatile LH secretion was analyzed using the cluster program. The opioidergic blockade elicited a robust increase in LH pulsatile activity and a 3-fold rise in serum FSH levels in 6 of the 12 women. This increased gonadotropin secretion lasted more than 24 h and was characterized by a progressive increase in LH pulse amplitude, which was 9-fold greater during the last 8 h of naloxone infusion [mean LH pulse amplitude, 36.5 +/- 4.5 (+/- SE) vs. 4.1 +/- 0.4 IU/L; P less than 0.001]. This increase was accompanied by a corresponding increase in transverse mean serum LH levels (83.3 +/- 13 vs. 20.7 +/- 3.2 IU/L; P less than 0.001), but no alteration of the interpulse interval (93 +/- 11 vs. 85 +/- 4 min). The peak serum LH concentrations exceeded 100 IU/L in all 6 of these women. This naloxone-advanced gonadotropin surge, resembling closely the spontaneous midcycle surge, resulted in a significantly shortened (P less than 0.001) follicular phase and a more than 2-fold elevation of serum P4, followed by assumed ovulation and normal luteal function. These 6 women had serum E2 levels immediately before naloxone infusion that were comparable to those during the preovulatory peak during the control cycle. In the 6 women who did not have a naloxone-induced increase in gonadotropin secretion the preinfusion serum E2 levels were substantially lower (P less than 0.001) than the values during the control cycle. These findings suggest that a transient decrease in opioidergic activity may contribute to the initiation of the midcycle gonadotropin surge in women.\r"

  ".W": "T4-binding globulin (TBG) is a glycoprotein of hepatic origin which transports thyroid hormone in serum. Inherited TBG defects in man are X-chromosome linked and are expressed in hemizygotes as complete deficiency, partial deficiency, or excess. Since TBG is not necessary for thyroid hormone action, affected subjects are healthy. Using DNA probes for human TBG, we searched for restriction fragment length polymorphisms in six affected males belonging to 6 unrelated families with inherited complete TBG deficiency and an equal number of normal males. TBG could not be detected in the serum of any of the TBG-deficient males by a specific and sensitive RIA capable of detecting as little as 5 micrograms TBG/L or 0.031% of the average normal serum TBG concentration. DNA isolated from white blood cells was digested with 11 restriction endonucleases, and the digests were submitted to DNA blot analysis using two cloned TBG-DNA probes which together covered the entire protein coding and the 5'-flanking sequences of the TBG gene. A total of 26 different bands were detected on DNA blots, identifying 18 restriction sites located within the 4.2-kilobase TBG gene, which includes intronic, exonic, and 5'-flanking sequences. This analysis, which sampled 2.3% of the total TBG genome, failed to reveal differences in fragment size among the 6 TBG-deficient and 6 normal males examined. One restriction endonuclease (NcoI) identified normal sequences at the putative promoter region of the gene, and four other endonucleases (TaqI, SstII, MspI, and HpaII) recognized the cytosine-guanine dinucleotide phosphate sequences representing potential mutation hot spots. Although C was methylated at these sites, no C to T (thymidine) transitions were found. These data suggest that large deletions, insertions, or rearrangements of the TBG gene, or mutations at sites of methylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotide phosphate dimers are not common mechanisms for inherited complete TBG deficiency in man.\r"

  ".U": "88331317\r", 
  ".W": "The association between insulin resistance and ovarian hyperstimulation has led to a hypothesis that insulin stimulates ovarian steroidogenesis. This possible effect of insulin on the ovary could be mediated by either the insulin receptor or the type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor, both of which have been described in the human ovary. We examined the in vitro regulation of insulin receptors by LH, FSH, multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA), and insulin in ovarian stromal fragments from 24 women. [125I]Insulin binding was measured in the presence and absence of increasing concentrations of insulin, IGF-I, LH, and FSH. Neither LH nor FSH competed with [125I]insulin for binding sites, but preincubation with LH or FSH reduced [125I]insulin binding by 19-38%. Preincubation with MSA reduced [125I]insulin binding by 34-48%. The affinity of the insulin receptors, determined by Scatchard analysis, did not change (Ka = 3.3 X 10(8) mol-1). A concentration of 10 ng/mL insulin in the preincubation medium reduced [125I]insulin binding by 40%, whereas an insulin concentration of 50 or 500 ng/mL completely obliterated specific [125I]insulin binding. [125I]Insulin binding fully recovered, however, 4 h after termination of tissue exposure to insulin. The specificity of [125I] insulin binding was confirmed by studies with IGF-I. We conclude that of the hormones examined, insulin is the most potent regulator of human ovarian insulin receptors in vitro. Down-regulation of insulin receptors by insulin was reversed within 4 h after withdrawal of insulin. MSA, FSH, and LH also down-regulated the number of human ovarian insulin receptors in vitro, but were less potent. These phenomena, if also present in vivo, could be important factors in the regulation of ovarian function by insulin in normal and pathological states.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that exogenous pulsatile administration of GnRH will increase serum bioactive FSH (bFSH) levels, we studied four boys with suspected idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). These boys presumably secreted relatively little GnRH. By virtue of their low baseline serum gonadotropin levels yet responsive pituitary gonadotrophs, these boys with IHH proved to be an excellent clinical model to test this hypothesis. Administration of GnRH (0.025 microgram/kg.dose) iv at 1- or 2-h intervals for 3-5 days resulted in an increase in serum bFSH after 91% of the GnRH doses. Serum immunoreactive FSH (iFSH) and LH (iLH) levels increased after 42% and 64% of the GnRH doses, respectively. Ninety percent of the iLH responses were concordant with bFSH responses, but only 33% of the iLH responses were concordant with iFSH responses. The serum bFSH responses occurred consistently within 20 min after GnRH administration and resulted in an increased serum bioactive to immunoreactive FSH ratio. By 60 min, serum bFSH levels had returned to preinjection levels. Serum testosterone and estradiol levels did not change during the period of GnRH administration in three of the four boys. We conclude that pulsatile, low dose iv GnRH administration in boys with IHH elicits significant serum bFSH increases by 20 min; the newly secreted FSH is preferentially enriched with increased in vitro FSH bioactivity, and it is rapidly cleared from serum (60 min). Therefore, serum bFSH measurements may provide a sensitive index of GnRH effects on the gonadotrophs.\r"

MR imaging revealed transection of the pituitary stalk in all patients and the formation of an ectopic posterior lobe at the proximal stump in 9 patients, none of whom had polydipsia or polyuria. Three patients without an ectopic posterior lobe had diabetes insipidus. The 5 patients who had small pituitary glands (less than 2 mm in height) had hypothyroidism with low serum TSH concentrations and low serum cortisol responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia; however, 7 patients with normal-sized pituitary glands had normal thyroid and adrenal function. The serum GH response to GHRH did not correlate with the size of the pituitary gland. The patients with small pituitary glands had delayed or prolonged serum TSH responses to TRH and impaired serum LH and FSH responses to GnRH; 4 of the patients with normal-sized pituitary glands had normal serum TSH, LH, and FSH responses. Only 2 patients had high basal serum PRL concentrations. The endocrinological data suggest that reestablishment of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal circulation, which cannot be seen by MR imaging, may occur. We suggest that the primary cause of idiopathic pituitary dwarfism in many patients is injury to the pituitary stalk at birth.\r"

In addition, plasma ir-GHRH and GH concentrations were determined before and after the administration of clonidine in six younger men, aged 19-25 yr. GHRH was extracted from plasma using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges and measured with a mid-portion-specific GHRH antiserum. The mean plasma ir-GHRH and GH levels ranged from 9-11 ng/L and 0.5-1.5 microgram/L, respectively, in the older men during a 2-h control study. After GHRH administration, the mean plasma ir-GHRH concentration increased to a peak of 512.5 ng/L at 3 min and GH to a peak of 9.2 micrograms/L at 10 min. Clonidine resulted in a significant increase in mean plasma GH levels (P less than 0.05) in the younger men, but not in the older men. Plasma ir-GHRH concentrations did not change after clonidine. L-Dopa increased plasma ir-GHRH at 60 min (P less than 0.05) and GH at 60-120 min (P less than 0.05). Insulin-induced hypoglycemia increased plasma GH levels (to a mean of 23.8 micrograms/L at 60 min; P less than 0.001), whereas plasma ir-GHRH levels did not change.

  ".W": "The inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) effects net sodium reabsorption under the control of volume regulatory hormones, including atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP). These studies examined the mechanisms of sodium transport and its regulation by ANP in fresh suspensions of IMCD cells. Sodium uptake was inhibited by amiloride but insensitive to furosemide, bu-metanide, and hydrochlorthiazide. These results are consistent with uptake mediated by a sodium channel or Na+/H+ exchange. To determine the role of sodium channels, cells were hyperpolarized by preincubation in high potassium medium followed by dilution into potassium-free medium. Membrane potential measurements using the cyanine dye, Di(S)-C3-5 verified a striking hyperpolarization of IMCD cells using this protocol. Hyperpolarization increased the apparent initial rate of sodium uptake fourfold. Amiloride and ANP inhibited potential-stimulated sodium uptake 73% and 65%, respectively; the two agents together were not additive. Addition of 5 mM sodium to hyperpolarized cells resulted in a significant amiloride-sensitive depolarization. Half-maximal inhibition of potential-driven sodium uptake occurred at 3 X 10(-7) M amiloride, and 5 X 10(-11) M ANP. We conclude that sodium enters IMCD cells via a conductive, amiloride-sensitive sodium channel, which is regulated by ANP. ANP inhibition of luminal sodium entry in the IMCD appears to contribute to the marked natriuretic effect of this hormone in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Current concepts of the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis suggest that the expanded numbers of activated T-helper/inducer cells at sites of disease activity result, at least in part, from their proliferation in the local milieu. Normal clonal proliferation of T cells involves activation and expression of the IL 2 receptor (IL 2R) gene. Thus, knowing that IL 2R mRNA transcripts are relatively long lived, we hypothesized that sarcoid blood T cells may contain IL 2R mRNA transcripts and express functional surface IL 2R, although the cells are probably activated elsewhere. Northern analysis using a 32P-labeled cDNA probe for the IL 2R p55 protein demonstrated that blood T cells of patients with active sarcoidosis, but not of normal patients, express 3.5- and 1.5-kb IL 2R mRNA transcripts, the same as those observed in normal T cells activated in vitro. Consistent with this, using flow cytometry and an MAb directed against the IL 2R p55 protein (2A3), we observed detectable levels of IL 2R surface protein on increased numbers of blood T cells of active sarcoidosis patients (4.7 +/- 0.9%) compared with blood T cells of normal patients (0.9 +/- 0.2%). Importantly, when the sarcoid blood T cells were exposed to IL 2 in vitro, they proliferated at a rate greater than that of normal blood T cells under the same conditions, suggesting that the IL 2R spontaneously expressed by sarcoid blood T cells were functionally active. In the context of the known compartmentalization of spontaneous IL 2 production and T cell proliferation at sites of disease in active pulmonary sarcoidosis, these IL 2R positive blood T cells would probably have a proliferative advantage if they trafficked to sites of active sarcoidosis, such as the lower respiratory tract.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the genetic origin of autoantibody production in several strains of mice that spontaneously develop a systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of gene loci encoding kappa light chain variable regions (Igk-V) demonstrated, as shown previously for the Ig heavy chain locus, that autoantibody production and disease occur in different Igk-V haplotypes. Moreover, autoimmune mice with known genetic derivation inherited their Igk-V loci essentially unaltered from their nonautoimmune ancestors. New Zealand black lupus mice, with unknown genetic derivation, had a possibly recombinant Igk-V haplotype, composed of V kappa loci that were primarily indistinguishable from those of nonautoimmune strains from either of the two potential donor haplotypes. The heavy and light chain gene segments (variable, diversity, joining) encoding anti-DNA antibodies were diverse and often closely related, or even identical, to those found in antibodies to foreign antigens in normal mice. Only 1 of 11 sequenced variable region genes could not be assigned to existing variable region gene families; however, corresponding germline genes were present in the genome of normal mice as well. These data argue against abnormalities in the genes and mechanisms generating antibody diversity in lupus mice and suggest a remarkable genetic and structural diversity in the generation of anti-DNA binding sites.\r"

Freshly isolated human peripheral blood monocytes were unable to ingest unopsonized P. aeruginosa; ingestion did not occur until the cells had been in culture for 2 d and it became maximal after 4 d. Macrophages plated on coverslips derivatized with anti-BSA IgG or with human gamma-globulin lost the capacity to phagocytose unopsonized P. aeruginosa, unopsonized zymosan, and EIgG but bound C3bi-coated erythrocytes normally. Each of the four human IgG subclasses and Fc fragments of anti-BSA IgG inhibited phagocytosis of both unopsonized P. aeruginosa and EIgG. Phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa and zymosan was markedly impaired and EIgG minimally inhibited if macrophages were plated on coverslips derivatized with mannan or when mannan was added to the phagocytosis buffer. Phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa and zymosan, and binding of EC3bi was dependent on the presence of divalent cations, but phagocytosis of EIgG was not. The macrophage phagocytic receptor for unopsonized P. aeruginosa was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes. Phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa was inhibited by D-mannose, L-fucose, and alpha methyl mannoside, but not by L-mannose, D-fucose, or D-glucose. The same sugars inhibited phagocytosis of unopsonized zymosan. We conclude that phagocytosis of unopsonized P. aeruginosa by human monocyte-derived macrophages is facilitated by mannose receptors.\r"

  ".U": "88331398\r", 
  ".W": "The glycoprotein hormone inhibin is produced by the Sertoli cells of the testis under the influence of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and is postulated in turn to inhibit FSH secretion. Luteinizing hormone (LH) is not recognized to have an important role in the control of inhibin secretion in any species. To determine the relative roles of FSH and LH in the control of inhibin secretion in man, we examined the effects of selective FSH and LH replacement on serum inhibin levels in normal men whose endogenous gonadotropins were suppressed by testosterone (T). After a 3-mo control period, nine men received 200 mg T enanthate i.m. weekly for 3-9 mo. During T treatment, serum LH and FSH levels were markedly suppressed and serum inhibin levels fell to 40% of control values. While continuing T, 3-5 mo of treatment with purified hFSH (n = 4) or hLH (n = 4) increased the respective serum gonadotropin level into the upper normal range and significantly increased inhibin levels back to 64 and 55% of control values, respectively. Supraphysiological LH replacement with high doses of human chorionic gonadotropin (n = 3) returned serum inhibin levels to 63% of control values. In no case did inhibin levels return fully to control levels. In conclusion, serum inhibin levels fell during gonadotropin suppression and were partially and approximately equally restored by either FSH or LH treatment. FSH presumably acts directly on the Sertoli cell to increase inhibin secretion whereas LH may act via increases in intratesticular T levels and/or other factor(s).\r"

These parameters were determined in vivo in resting control, 2-d-fasted, and hypocalorically fed rats and in animals similarly hypocalorically fed and then refed. The ATP, Pi, and intracellular Mg2+ levels were comparable in the four groups. When the fasted and underfed animals were compared with the control and refed animals, there were falls in the ratios of CrP/Pi and CrP/ATP, in the calculated CrP, and the free-energy change of ATP hydrolysis, but a rise in the calculated free ADP. In the hypocaloric group, intracellular pH fell significantly and a large peak was noted in the phosphodiester region. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that ATP levels are maintained at the cost of CrP, suggesting that ATP production is disturbed by aerobic and anaerobic mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "By preventing macrophages from destroying phagocytized microorganisms, glucocorticoids lower natural resistance of the host against many pathogens. gamma-Interferon has an opposite effect and restores activity of dexamethasone-treated mononuclear phagocytes against some but not all microorganisms. In the present studies we show that dexamethasone impairs activity of human blood monocytes kept in culture for 36 h against Listeria monocytogenes, without impairing H2O2 or O2- secretion. Likewise dexamethasone does not interfere with activation of systems generating oxygen metabolites by lymphokines. Thus gamma-interferon increases three- to fivefold the capacity of dexamethasone-treated monocytes to secrete O2- or H2O2 upon stimulation by opsonized zymosan, live bacteria, or phorbol myristate acetate. Concurrently gamma-interferon restores listericidal activity of dexamethasone-treated monocytes. After gradual activation by exposure to gamma-interferon for progressive time periods, listericidal activity becomes tightly correlated (r = 0.922-0.994) with the amount of H2O2 or O2- secreted by dexamethasone-treated monocytes. Activation of oxidative systems by the lymphokine is, however, not correlated with the restoration of activity against Aspergillus spores, lost during dexamethasone treatment, which does not depend on antimicrobial oxygen metabolites. Taken together, these observations lend to the hypothesis that glucocorticoids impair nonoxidative defense mechanisms of \"resting\" macrophages, while gamma-interferon restores macrophage function impaired by glucocorticoids by activating alternate killing systems, which are at least partly of oxidative nature.\r"

These prevalence estimates generally show higher rates of disability for females than males. Unfortunately, prevalence estimates can be misleading when one attempts to assess the risks of certain types of health event transitions for individuals. This study directly examined the individual transitions both into and out of functionally impaired states using longitudinal data from the 1982 and 1984 National Long Term Care Surveys (NLTCS). The data show that, even at very high levels of impairment, there are significant numbers of community residents who apparently manifest long-term improvement in functioning. The longitudinal data also show that the risks of becoming disabled are roughly the same for males and females. This suggests that sex differences in the national prevalence of disabilities arise from the greater longevity of females at any given level of age and functional impairment.\r"

Patients in both groups were of comparable demography. Healing was significantly quicker with ranitidine. Of patients randomized to treatment, healing (intention-to-treat analysis) at 4 weeks was E 47% and R 69%, and at 6 weeks it was E 66% and R 88%. In patients who met all protocol criteria and completed treatment, healing at 4 weeks was E 58% and R 80%, and at 6 weeks it was E 81% and R 92%. Early relief of pain, both during the day and at night, was significantly quicker with ranitidine. Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain occurred more often with enprostil. There were no clinically important abnormalities in hematology or biochemistry. Relapse rates were similar. In conclusion, enprostil is not as effective as ranitidine in healing duodenal ulcers.\r"

Prospective incidence surveillance of nursing home acquired infections was conducted over a 12-month period, during which time denominator information on census and patient care days was also collected. Monthly infection rates were calculated based on (a) census (number infections per month/average monthly census), and (b) care duration (number infections per month/average monthly resident stay days). Results showed average monthly infection incidence of 27.4 episodes, (range 19-37), with average monthly census of 166.2 (range 160.0-180.0) and average monthly patient days of 5056 (range 4631-5583). The average census based monthly infection rate was 16.5 (range 11.9-22.4); average care duration based monthly infection rate was 5.4 (range 3.8-7.2) episodes per 1000 patient care days. Results indicate care duration based rates demonstrate less marked rate fluctuation than census based findings, and that duration based rates are more similar to values observed in acute care hospital nosocomial infection rates, thus are less likely to be misunderstood or misinterpreted by staff. Institutions should consider analyzing their methods for depicting infection data to provide consistency and clarity in data reporting.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were conducted to determine the influence of immunologic stress on methionine and lysine requirements of growing chicks. Immunologic stress was elicited by injection of either Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide or heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus every other day for 6 d. In the first experiment, diets were formulated to provide methionine levels of 0.30, 0.50 and 0.70%. In the second experiment, diets contained 0.75, 0.90 or 1.2% lysine. In chicks fed amino acid-sufficient diets, those chicks injected with immunogens had slower growth, lower feed intake and poorer efficiency of feed utilization than those injected with saline. The decreases due to immunogens were diminished in chicks fed amino acid-deficient diets. The methionine requirements of saline- and immunogen-injected chicks were above 0.5% and between 0.3 and 0.5%, respectively; the lysine requirements were greater than 0.95% and between 0.7 and 0.95%, respectively. Thus immunogen injection decreased methionine and lysine requirements, probably because of a decreased need of amino acids for growth and tissue accretion. Immunogen-induced depression in serum zinc and increase in serum copper levels were ameliorated by lysine or methionine deficiencies. Compared with saline-injected chicks, immunogen-injected chicks had significantly higher serum interleukin-1 (IL-1) activity by 53% when fed the methionine-sufficient diet, but they did not have significantly greater IL-1 levels when fed the methionine-deficient diet. These observations indicate that the diminished expression of immunologic stress in amino acid-deficient chicks is due to an impaired immune response.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of ethanol on the beta adrenergic receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase system were examined in vitro using membranes prepared from S49 lymphoma cells. Ethanol caused a dose-dependent increase in adenylate cyclase activity in membranes prepared from wild-type cells when the activity was measured in the presence of GTP. Activity measured in the presence of isoproterenol was also increased by ethanol, but the fold-stimulation by isoproterenol was lower in the presence of ethanol. Ethanol also shifted the dose-response curve for stimulation of the enzyme by isoproterenol to the right. This shift was due to a decrease in the affinity of the beta adrenergic receptor for isoproterenol. A decrease in the affinity of the receptor for the antagonists [125I]iodopindolol and propranolol was also observed, but the magnitude of this effect was less than that seen with the agonist isoproterenol. The density of binding sites for [125I]iodopindolol was not affected by ethanol. Dose-response curves for NaF and guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), both of which stimulate adenylate cyclase activity through an effect on the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gs), were shifted to the left by the addition of ethanol. In membranes prepared from the CYC- variant of S49 cells, which lacks the alpha subunit of Gs, guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. The inhibition by guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) was not affected by ethanol. In membranes prepared from both wild-type and CYC- S49 cells, ethanol inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Whereas the inhibition of this activity by GTP was greatly attenuated in membranes prepared from CYC- S49 cells which had been pretreated with pertussis toxin, the inhibition by ethanol was not affected by pretreatment with pertussis toxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effects of chronic midazolam (8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H- imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine) administration on discriminative motor control, rats were trained to hold a force transducer operated with a paw so that it remained between upper and lower limits of a force band for a continuous 1.5-sec period to deliver each food pellet. Acute doses of midazolam (0.75-3.0 mg/kg s.c.) impaired indices of motor performance as well as session work rate, a measure of sedation. Separate groups received chronic midazolam injections either pressession (Before Group) or postsession (After Group), or presession vehicle (Vehicle Group). The After and Vehicle Groups indicated that neither chronic postsession midazolam, its withdrawal, nor time alone, changed motor performance. The Before Group was affected, and although complete tolerance to work-rate decrements developed rapidly to chronic dosing (3.0 mg/kg), tolerance to motor impairment was incomplete even after 4 months. Presession drug probes with midazolam to the After Group revealed that, although tolerance to work-rate decrement had developed, no tolerance had developed with respect to the capacity for midazolam to impair motor performance. During the chronic phase of midazolam injection to the Before Group, sessions that omitted midazolam, or antagonized it with Ro 15-1788, led to improved motor performance (a drug-purge effect). Precipitated withdrawal was not produced by Ro 15-1788, although simple drug withdrawal did disrupt Before Group motor performance after 4 months of chronic dosing. Ensuing sessions showed a marked improvement in motor performance which returned to the original, prechronic, base-line level.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is known to potentiate the pressor effect of norepinephrine. In the present work, we evaluated in unanesthetized normotensive rats the effect of NPY on blood pressure responsiveness not only to norepinephrine, but also to tyramine, a sympathomimetic agent acting indirectly to B-HT933, a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulant, to angiotensin II and vasopressin. Dose-response curves to the various pressor agents were established starting at the 45th min of an i.v. infusion with either NPY (0.025 and 0.1 microgram/min) or its vehicle. The two doses of NPY increased blood pressure by an average of approximately 6 mm Hg, which was not significantly different from the vehicle-induced blood pressure changes. NPY significantly enhanced the pressor effect of norepinephrine, tyramine and angiotensin II, but not that of B-HT933 and vasopressin. We also tested whether NPY inhibits the enzyme activity of Na, K-adenosine triphosphatase using a purified toad kidney preparation. Concentrations of NPY from 10(-14) M up to 10(-6) M had no effect on the enzyme activity. It appears therefore that the blood pressure potentiating effect of NPY is not restricted to alpha adrenoceptor stimulation with norepinephrine, but involves also the vasoconstrictor hormone angiotensin II. This NPY-induced potentiation does not seem to depend upon stimulation of alpha-2 adrenoceptors or inhibition of Na,K-adenosine triphosphatase.\r"

  ".W": "We have demonstrated previously that ethanol increases the in vitro synthesis and release of prolactin by the anterior pituitary gland. In the present study we have examined the possible role of calcium and calmodulin in the ethanol-stimulation of in vitro prolactin release from hemipituitary glands. We also investigated the effect of inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism on the release of prolactin induced by ethanol. In addition we studied the effect of ethanol on the release of prostaglandins and the conversion of arachidonic acid to hydroperoxides. Basal and ethanol-stimulated prolactin release was almost blocked completely by omitting calcium from the incubation medium. In vitro addition of calmodulin-blocking agents such as pimozide and trifluoperazine reduced basal and ethanol-induced prolactin release. Acetylsalicylic acid, an inhibitor of the cycloxygenase pathway, had no effect on prolactin release. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid, an inhibitor of the lipoxygenase pathway, blocked completely the release of prolactin induced by ethanol. Ethanol (5 and 10 mM) significantly increased the release of prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha and the conversion of [14C]arachidonic acid to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. The results of this study show that ethanol increases prolactin release by a calcium-dependent mechanism. Besides, our data suggest that arachidonic acid metabolism is involved in ethanol-stimulated prolactin secretion and that lipoxygenase pathway metabolites are at least partially responsible for this effect.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, we have characterized the effects of guanine nucleotides on agonist and antagonist binding to A1 adenosine receptors, which mediate inhibition of adenylate cyclase via the inhibitory G protein (Gi) in adipocytes. Our data indicate that guanosine-triphosphate (GTP) and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) enhance the binding of 8-(4-[(([(2-amino-ethyl)amino]carbonyl) methyl)oxyl]phenyl)-1,3-dipropylxanthine ([3H]XAC) to adipocyte membranes in a dose-dependent manner, with EC50 values being 1.8 and 2.2 microM, respectively. The stimulatory effect of GTP was abolished in pertussis toxin-intoxicated membranes, implying a role of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein in mediating this effect. Furthermore, the ranked order of efficacy for a series of guanine nucleotides to enhance [3H]XAC binding was GTP = Gpp(NH)p greater than GDP greater than GDP beta S = cGMP, which paralleled their ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Saturation isotherms performed in the absence and presence of GTP and Gpp(NH)p indicate that the guanine nucleotide decreased the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) but had no effect on the maximal binding (Bmax) of [3H]XAC. In contrast, Gpp(NH)p decreased agonist binding as manifested by a decrease in the percentage of A1 adenosine receptors in the agonist high affinity state (from 81% to 27%) without changing the high (KH) and low (KL) affinity constants. Kinetic experiments conducted to assess the effect of guanine nucleotide on [3H]XAC binding parameters demonstrate that Gpp(NH)p enhanced the observed rate of association (Kobs) of the radioligand with the receptor by 2-fold but had no effect on the rate of dissociation (K-1) of the radioligand-receptor complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The goal of this study was to make functional comparisons between muscarinic receptors mediating endothelial-dependent relaxation responses in the rabbit ear artery and receptors mediating endothelial-independent contractile responses. Ring segments of the bovine coronary artery with the endothelium removed proved to be an excellent model for studying the properties of muscarinic receptors mediating vascular smooth muscle contraction. Although endothelial-dependent relaxation responses could be seen with the calcium ionophore A-23187, no relaxation responses to cholinergic agonists were seen in the bovine coronary artery, whether or not the endothelium was present or in the presence or absence of smooth muscle tone. In ring segments of the bovine coronary artery or the rabbit ear artery, the cholinergic agonists, acetylcholine, methacholine and carbachol, proved to be approximately equipotent in evoking contraction or relaxation, respectively. In contrast, the putative M1 selective agonist McN-A-343 did not produce any effect in either tissue; nor did McN-A-343 have any effect on a perfused rabbit ear artery segment. Measurement of antagonist affinities indicated that the bovine coronary artery muscarinic receptors show low affinity for both pirenzepine (pKB = 6.9) and AF-DX 116 (11-2-[[2-[diethylaminomethyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one) (pKB = 6.3). Pirenzepine affinity was also low in the perfused rabbit ear artery preparation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Furthermore, ANF-induced vasodilatation and hypotension may limit the assessment of its own renal physiological effects. We infused ANF (human ANF 102-126) to anesthetized portal vein-ligated rats, a model with prehepatic portal hypertension. Arterial pressure was reduced by 17%, but portal pressure was unaffected. Diuresis and natriuresis were explained in part by an increase in glomerular filtration rate; in addition, renal vascular resistance was significantly decreased. The natriuretic response to ANF was slightly, but significantly, decreased in portal hypertensive rats as compared to controls (fractional excretion of sodium, 1.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.3; P less than .05). The addition of Phe-Ile-Orn-vasopressin, a V1 receptor agonist, normalized arterial pressure but induced a significant decrease in portal pressure (15 +/- 0.9 mm Hg base line vs. 12.8 +/- 0.7 combination group; P less than .01). Furthermore, the combination of both drugs markedly potentiated the natriuretic effects (0.4 +/- 0.1 microEq/min of control vs. 10.0 +/- 2.3 ANF vs. 32.2 +/- 3.3 combination group; P less than .001). The natriuretic potentiation resulted from increments in glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow. Normalization of arterial pressure may enhance the renal physiological effects of ANF, in this portal hypertensive model.\r"
