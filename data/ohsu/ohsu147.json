The SAH was produced by a single injection of fresh autologous arterial blood (1 ml/kg body weight) into the cisterna magna. The density (the averaged number of nerve fibers in a unit area) of VIP-, SP-, and NPY-immunoreactive perivascular nerve fibers in the M1 segment and the BA was markedly decreased (5% to 40% of the normal value) immediately after the injection. The density of VIP- and SP-immunoreactive perivascular fibers increased 2 or 3 weeks after SAH and became normal by the 63rd day after injection. On the other hand, no substantial recovery was observed in the density of NPY-immunoreactive perivascular fibers by 63 days after injection.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental microvascular anastomosis using a glutide copolymer (lactide:glycolide, 80:20) as an external splint was undertaken in 33 rats between the carotid artery and the jugular vein. Both vessels were dissected free over a 1-cm length and cut at the cranial end of the dissected part. The carotid artery was then introduced into a glutide pipe-splint. The arterial wall was turned 180 degrees over the edge of the splint. This reflected artery wall and the glutide were covered by the freed-up jugular vein. One stitch was made around the vein, the artery, and the glutide in a manner similar to binding steel wire over a barrel. Thus, the \"one-knot anastomosis\" was completed. The patency rate at the anastomosed site was 100%, confirmed by angiography in 30 rats and by direct surgery in three. The time required to produce the anastomosis was between 5 and 7 minutes. Light microscopic observation showed that there was no obstruction by thrombus formation at 1 and 5 weeks after the anastomotic surgery. This technique may be clinically applicable for extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery, reconstruction of venous sinuses, and other vascular procedures.\r"

The procedures described are suggested as possible alternatives to extensive bone repositioning procedures. They have the advantage of being quicker and are therefore potentially safer operations. Acrylic is malleable and does not resorb; thus, permanent superior esthetic results may be achieved. The two most serious risks when using this technique are infection and limitation of growth. The risk of infection may be reduced by attaching the acrylic implant securely to surrounding bone, under sterile conditions, beneath well-vascularized skin. Growth limitation may be obviated by not placing acrylic across sutures in children with enlarging skulls.\r"

Histological analysis of 195 biopsy specimens obtained from various locations within the volumes defined by CT and MRI revealed that: contrast enhancement most often corresponded to tumor tissue without intervening parenchyma; hypodensity corresponded to parenchyma infiltrated by isolated tumor cells or in some instances to tumor tissue in low-grade gliomas or to simple edema; and isolated tumor cell infiltration extended at least as far as T2 prolongation on magnetic resonance images. This information may be useful in planning surgical procedures and radiation therapy in patients with intracranial glial neoplasms.\r"

This usually is due to variables such as the degree of dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system or ureter, the degree of bladder distention, the diuretic dose, and the state of hydration. We developed the volume expansion diuretic renal scan (VEDRS) to overcome these variables and to improve the accuracy of the technique. Twelve patients who had obstructive patterns on the diuretic renal scan were evaluated. Ten patients were shown to be dilated but not obstructed. Two patients were confirmed as obstructed. This technique improves the accuracy of the diuretic renal scan.\r"

  ".W": "The precise measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (ERPF) usually requires continuous intravenous administration of adequate substances, with multiple blood and urine analysis, and does not allow measurement of separate renal function. Schlegel et al. and Gates described isotopic methods for the measurement of global and unilateral GFR and ERPF based on the determination by scintillation camera of the fraction of the injected dose ([99mTc]DTPA-[131I]hippuran) present in the kidneys 1-3 min after its administration. These methods require counting of the injected dose and correction for attenuation, but no blood or urine sampling. We have validated these techniques by simultaneous infusion of inulin and PAH in patients with various levels of global renal function (anuric to normal). To better define unilateral renal function we have also studied nine kidneys in patients either nephrectomized or with a nephrostomy enabling unilateral function measurement. A good correlation between inulin or PAH clearances and fractional uptake of [99mTc]DTPA or [131I]hippuran by the kidney was observed. Very good reproducibility of both isotopic techniques was shown. We conclude that determination of the fractional uptake of [99mTc]DTPA and [131I]hippuran between 1 and 3 min allows good and reproducible prediction of global and especially of unilateral kidney function with great rapidity and simplicity, rendering this technique suitable for clinical practice.\r"

To evaluate whether it is necessary to correct these measurements for radioactivity in the chest wall and pulmonary vasculature five patients with no ventilation to one hemithorax were studied. After inhaling a submicronic aerosol of [99mTc]DTPA a gamma camera measured count rates over both hemithoraces for 20 min. The observed T1/2 for clearance from the normal hemithorax was 56 min (range 18-115 min), and when this was corrected for chest wall contribution (derived from the abnormal hemithorax) the average T1/2 was 52 min (range 17-107 min). To simulate infinitely permeable lungs we measured thoracic radioactivity in two adults and six children who were injected i.v. with a known amount of [99mTc]DTPA. The count rate over the thorax was only 8.1% (range 2.7%-11%) of that obtained when a similar amount of aerosolized [99mTc]DTPA was deposited in the lungs during a subsequent study. We conclude that it is not necessary to correct for nonpulmonary epithelial radioactivity during the measurement of [99mTc]DTPA clearance rate from the lungs.\r"

To investigate the effect of species variation, the plasma clearance of [99mTc]PAHIDA was investigated in dogs. The plasma disappearance of the renal agent approached that of [99mTc]DTPA and was significantly less than that of OIH.

Data suggesting that the inhibition by ethanol involves its oxidation to acetate were obtained with rat hepatocytes maintained in primary culture. Ethanol, acetaldehyde and acetate were approximately equally effective inhibitors of [14C]pantothenate conversion to CoA (46-71%) and had no effect on uptake of [14C]pantothenate by hepatocytes. In the presence of saturating levels of acetate, acetaldehyde had no additional inhibitory effect. Cyanamide and diethyldithiocarbamate decreased the inhibition by acetaldehyde at the same concentration (10 microM), which saturated their ability to inhibit acetaldehyde oxidation. Studies with an isolated pantothenate kinase preparation showed that, of the ethanol metabolites, only acetyl-CoA was an effective inhibitor. Acetate and butyrate, which were both inhibitors of [14C]pantothenate conversion to CoA, increased the acetyl-CoA and decreased the free, unacylated CoA (CoASH) content of the cultured hepatocytes. The data were consistent with a mechanism for the inhibitory effect of ethanol that involves inhibition of pantothenate kinase by acetyl-CoA, but did not exclude a possible role of additional regulatory factors.\r"

Immature albino rats were fed a low zinc (less than 1 ppm) diet based on soybean protein, a similar control diet (100 ppm) ad libitum or the control diet, pair-fed. After 3 wk, the carotid arteries were catheterized for blood pressure measurement and graded doses of the vasodilators were injected as a bolus into a branch of the femoral vein. In one experiment graded doses (0-8 micrograms/kg body wt) of Bk and in another graded doses (0-400 ng/kg body wt) of PGI2 were injected. In a third experiment the PGI2 doses ranged from 0 to 1000 ng/kg and, in addition to the 3-wk depletion group, two groups were repleted by feeding the control diet for 1 or 4 d. The low zinc diet induced zinc deficiency as evidenced by low rates of gain and low plasma zinc levels and significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased the blood pressure response (Emax) to both BK and PGI2. Pair feeding had no significant effect on the response; the Emax values as determined by double-reciprocal plots of the data were unchanged by the quantity of control diet consumed. Short-term repletion did not restore the PGI2 response to control values. The data are interpreted as suggesting that zinc deficiency impairs the function of vasodilator receptors in the rat vasculature.\r"

Male weanling rats were fed isoenergetic diets containing either 27% (wt/wt) fructose or glucose for 11 wk. During the final 4 wk, rats in each group were either untreated (control) or treated orally with 20 mg/kg body wt levamisole or 0.5 ppm vanadate via their drinking water. Basal glucose oxidation to CO2 was 45% higher in the fructose-control than in the glucose-control group. Insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation in both control groups was not higher than the basal rate in fructose-fed rats. Basal lipogenesis was 31% lower in the fructose-control than in the glucose-control group. Insulin-stimulated lipogenesis was much higher than basal, but was not different between fructose- and glucose-control groups. Levamisole increased basal lipogenesis in fructose-fed rats. Vanadate acted synergistically with fructose in greatly diminishing insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation. Fasting plasma insulin levels were lower and fasting plasma glucose and triglycerides were higher in fructose- than in glucose-fed rats, irrespective of treatment. Results suggest that adaptation to dietary fructose enhances basal oxidative capacity in an insulin-like fashion and reduces the basal lipogenic capacity of adipose tissue. Treatment with levamisole and vanadate lowers the overall rate of glucose metabolism and alters the effects of fructose.\r"

The grafted cleft area was followed radiographically for three to six months postsurgery. Although it was difficult to quantitate, it was both clinically and radiographically apparent at three months that bone bridging and filling of the cleft had occurred in 100% of the cases. From this study, it appears that allogeneic bone is a viable alternative for repairing alveolar clefts and that its use has a significant benefit to the patient by eliminating the morbidity of a second operative site.\r"

Thirty mongrel dogs underwent ridge augmentation with 3 ml of HA alone (HAO), HA combined with autogenous bone (HAB), or HA combined with demineralized bone (HAD). Bone was not found in the HAO augmented ridges through 52 weeks; bone was found in the HAB augmented ridges by 12 weeks, and the HAD augmented ridges had bone formation after 26 weeks. This study demonstrates that demineralized bone can induce osteogenesis within the HA augmented dog ridge, but it is delayed when compared to HAB augmentations.\r"

  ".W": "The buccal contour of the mandible was augmented in 17 dogs with 5 X 7.5 X 20 mm blocks of porous hydroxylapatite (HA) on one side and two-layered split rib autografts on the other. Both specimens were retrieved at three, six, 12, 24, and 48 months. Undecalcified sections were prepared for microradiography, light and UV microscopy, and histometry. A transmitted light video image digitizing system was used to trace implant and graft perimeters and calculate cross sectional areas. This system was also used to measure graft density and calculate bone and soft tissue compositions. The HA matrix, bone and soft tissue compositions of implant specimens were measured with a backscattered scanning electron microscope imaging digitizing system. All grafts became increasingly resorbed with time whereas all implants remained intact. Mature osteotonic bone ingrowth was present in all implants except one which failed to unite with the mandibular cortex. The mean graft areas decreased from 30.8 mm2 at three months to 0.7 mm2 at 48 months, while the implant areas averaged 35.5 mm2 and remained stable. The graft specimens were composed of 46.6% bone and 53.4% soft tissue or fluid space. The implant specimens were composed of 34.5% HA matrix, 28.6% bone, and 33.9% soft tissue. The HA matrix had a surface area of 9.8 mm2/mm3 that was 61.9% covered with bone ingrowth and 38.1% covered with soft tissue or fluid space. In contrast to the rapid resorption of graft onlays, the porous HA matrix demonstrated a long-term permanence with maintenance of contour and osseous incorporation over the four-year duration of this study.\r"

  ".W": "The pathophysiology of SIDS remains unknown. Although a multifactorial cause appears plausible on the basis of available data, new data are needed to determine which components of this multifactorial hypothesis are most important and whether other factors need to be added. We need to better understand control of breathing in the newborn infant and the manner in which maturation of cardiorespiratory control progresses during infancy. The unique period of vulnerability for SIDS, in which risk is less in the neonate than at 2 to 6 months of age, remains unexplained. Is there a worsening in some aspect of cardiorespiratory control in infants destined to die of SIDS? An improved understanding of the increased risk in black infants, preterm infants, and infants with intrauterine drug exposure, although only a small percentage of all SIDS deaths, should contribute substantially to our understanding. Appropriately designed and well-controlled prospective studies are needed in asymptomatic infants at risk, to determine the true contemporary nonintervention rate of SIDS and the extent to which any assessment or intervention lowers this rate. Prospective pneumogram screening studies have demonstrated significant group differences in respiratory patterns in normal infants compared with later SIDS victims, but have failed to achieve sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be useful for populationwide prospective screening. To assess aspects of brainstem cardiorespiratory control in addition to those assessed by a conventional pneumogram, future studies will need to be based on an expanded or modified technology. On the basis of both physiologic considerations and available technology, addition of an oxygen saturation channel offers the most promise for providing a more comprehensive assessment of cardiorespiratory control. If there is an underlying deficiency in asphyxic arousal responsiveness, for example, with or without other respiratory control deficits, continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation as part of a second-generation pneumogram system currently has the greatest promise for providing a modified pneumogram assessment of greater clinical use. The use of continuous oxygen saturation as a home monitoring technique should also be investigated. Power spectrum analysis of cardiorespiratory variability also appears to have potential advantages over conventional pneumogram analyses, and needs to be evaluated in prospective studies. The following statements summarize our current knowledge regarding SIDS, apnea, pneumograms, and home monitors: The cause(s) of SIDS remains unknown.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The total febrile period and the duration of fever after treatment were significantly shorter in the gammaglobulin group than in the aspirin group (P less than 0.001). The incidence of coronary artery lesions and of coronary artery aneurysms was significantly lower in the gammaglobulin group than in the aspirin group up to 30 days after the onset of Kawasaki disease (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively). In 16 of 69 patients given gammaglobulin, fever persisted for longer than 3 days, and there was a higher incidence of coronary artery lesions among them. The effectiveness of high doses of gammaglobulin in preventing coronary artery lesions has been demonstrated, but the indications and the optimal dose of gammaglobulin remain to be determined.\r"

The treatment failure rate was 21% in those with immunologically significant infection, versus 8% in those without antibody rises (P greater than 0.1). All group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABS) strains isolated from patients with treatment failure, both before and after benzathine penicillin G therapy, were exquisitely susceptible to penicillin G (minimum inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0.02 microgram/mL), and none showed evidence of tolerance (minimum bactericidal concentration less than or equal to 0.04 microgram/mL). Thus, we found GABS eradication rates to exceed 10% in children given benzathine penicillin G. The failure rate did not appear to be related to enrichment of the patient population with a high proportion of asymptomatic carriers nor to the presence of penicillin-tolerant GABS.\r"

In vitro it has a Ki value of 0.7 microM vs. [3H]leukotriene D4 ([3H]-LTD4) binding to membranes from guinea pig lung. Against LTC4-, LTD4- and LTE4-induced contractions of guinea pig parenchymal strips, it has Kb values of ca 3 microM and was relatively ineffective against contractions induced by other spasmogens. The peptiodoleukotriene-antagonist activity is also demonstrable against the hemodynamic and vasoconstriction effects of LTD4 in isolated guinea pig hearts. Oral antagonist activity has been shown with an LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction model and with an LTD4-induced wheal response model in guinea pigs. Unlike other reported antagonists, REV 5901 is ineffective against the multiple forms of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. Thus, in addition to its previously reported activity as a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, REV 5901 is a p.o. active antagonist of peptidoleukotrienes and represents a good tool for understanding the role of peptidoleukotrienes in disease.\r"

In both groups data were obtained at rest and during submaximal treadmill exercise during alternate infusion of captopril and saline. In the congestive heart failure group captopril reduced systemic vascular resistance, mean arterial pressure and left ventricular systolic pressure (P less than .05 each). Blood flow to the renal, gastrointestinal and coronary circulations was reduced in the heart failure group treated with saline vehicle. Flow to the renal and gastrointestinal beds of heart failure animals was enhanced to values similar to those observed in sham animals during captopril treatment. Left ventricular coronary flow was also increased significantly by captopril in both sham and heart failure animals. The most prominent effects of captopril occurred in the renal circulation of the heart failure group in which blood flow increased by 55%. Blood flow to skeletal muscle and skin was unchanged by captopril both in sham and heart failure animals at rest and during exercise. Maximal oxygen consumption was not affected by captopril treatment. Thus, captopril induced a differential pattern of vasodilation with the greatest effect in the renal bed and a less intensive effect in the gastrointestinal and coronary beds. The unchanged flow to skeletal muscle may explain the failure of captopril to improve exercise capacity after short-term administration.\r"

  ".W": "Although the discriminative stimulus effects of the clinically useful ergot derivative lisuride have previously been related to dopamine (DA) neuronal systems, the involvement of DA D1 and D2 receptor subtypes in the lisuride cue has been characterized for the first time in the present experiment. In rats trained to discriminate lisuride (0.04 mg/kg) from saline, appropriate doses of the putative D2 agonist LY 171555 (0.008-0.063 mg/kg) substituted completely whereas the D1 agonist SKF 38393 (2.0-16.0 mg/kg) evoked primarily saline-lever responding. When given in combination with lisuride (0.04 mg/kg), the D2 antagonist (-)-sulpiride (5-30 mg/kg), but not the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 (0.125-0.5 mg/kg), blocked the lisuride cue. Combination tests also suggested that bromuride and pirenperone have DA antagonist properties. Although the specificity of these agents is not fully known, these results support the conclusion that D2 but not D1 receptors play an important role in the stimulus effects of lisuride. Although a role for serotonin in the similar stimulus properties of lisuride and SCH 23390 cannot be ruled out, partial substitution of SCH 23390 (0.0625-0.35 mg/kg; administered alone) for lisuride complements previous observations which suggest that the two DA subtypes may be functionally linked in vivo.\r"

After acquisition of the discrimination (average = 161 sessions), they were tested with a series of compounds selected to characterize the neuronal mechanism(s) of the discrimination and to determine whether the site of action was central or peripheral. APO produced a dose-related increase in the percentage of responses that occurred on the drug lever during test sessions. The D2 dopamine (DA) agonist piribedil substituted completely for APO and the D2 DA antagonist pimozide antagonized the APO discriminative stimulus in a manner consistent with a competitive antagonism. On the other hand, the D1 agonist SKF 38393 engendered principally saline lever responding in all monkeys, whereas the D1 DA antagonist SCH 23390 was ineffective as an APO antagonist. The APO effect was neither mimicked by DA nor blocked by the D2DA antagonist domperidone, both of which fail to cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent. In substitution tests the norepinephrine reuptake blocker nisoxetine, the serotonin agonist quipazine and the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine, as well as d-amphetamine, cocaine and morphine engendered principally saline lever responding up to doses that substantially reduced rate of responding. Taken together these results suggest that the APO discriminative stimulus is based principally upon an action at a D2 receptor in the central nervous system and that this preparation can be used for studying the functional properties of central nervous system D2 receptors.\r"

The objective of the present investigation was to examine the influence of tyramine in these monoamine oxidase-inhibited dogs on the kinetics of Tc-99m-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Tc-99m-DTPA) during its first passage through the brain by nuclear imaging techniques. The study began with anesthetized mongrel dogs (n = 10) in a supine position over the camera detector. Data acquisition was started simultaneously after the rapid intracarotid injection of Tc-99m-DTPA (5 mCi) and 60 0.5-sec images of the brain were taken. Tyramine induced increased uptake with a concomitant impairment in the elimination of Tc-99m-DTPA from the brain of these phenelzine-treated animals with hepatic injury (n = 5) as compared to pretreated animals serving as a control group or phenelzine-treated animals without liver disease. This was accompanied by an appreciable reduction in hemispheric cerebral blood flow (50.5 +/- 19.3 vs. 110 +/- 16 ml/100 g/min), respectively. Increased cerebrovascular permeability of Tc-99m-DTPA and decreased cerebral blood flow occurred concomitantly with increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure and elevation in cerebrospinal fluid catecholamines of monoamine oxidase-inhibited animals with hepatic injury.\r"

In contrast, prior administration of beta-FNA produced no appreciable shift in the analgesic dose-response curve of the selective kappa agonist, U-50, 488H. These results suggest that beta-FNA is selective for mu over kappa receptors under the conditions used in this study. The dose-response curves for ethylketazocine and proxorphan were affected only to a small extent by beta-FNA pretreatment, suggesting that these compounds have analgesic actions mediated primarily through nonmu, probably kappa receptors. The dose-response curves for cyclazocine, buprenorphine, butorphanol, nalorphine and nalbuphine were shifted markedly to the right and frequently not in a parallel fashion by the prior administration of beta-FNA. These results seem to indicate a major role for the mu receptor in the analgesic actions of these compounds.\r"

Two approaches were used at supraspinal and spinal sites: determination of possible cross-tolerance between morphine and a variety of receptor selective/nonselective agonists (DPDPE, [D-Pen2, L-Pen5]enkephalin (DPLPE), [D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin, [D-Ala2, Met5]enkephalin amide, [D-Ser2, Leu5, Thr6]enkephalin and [D-Thr2 Leu, Thr6]enkephalin) and possible potentiation of morphine (mu) analgesia by proposed delta agonists (DPDPE, DPLPE and [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin) in naive and morphine-tolerant mice. Additionally, proposed mu (morphine) and delta (DPDPE) agonists were evaluated for their i.c.v. analgesic effectiveness in the absence, and in the presence, of the proposed delta antagonist ICI 174,864. The present communication now reports that after i.c.v. administration analgesic cross-tolerance could be demonstrated between morphine and a variety of relatively selective or nonselective opioids but not to the highly delta selective DPDPE and DPLPE. This result was consistent with direct antagonism of i.c.v. DPDPE, but not morphine analgesia, by ICI 174,864. Furthermore, i.c.v. DPDPE and DPLPE were able to potentiate morphine analgesia in either naive or morphine-tolerant mice. In contrast, after intrathecal administration, cross-tolerance could be demonstrated between DPDPE or DPLPE and morphine, and no potentiation of morphine by DPDPE could be observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists can constrict the kidneys of dogs, cats and rabbits in vivo. Because alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction is often difficult to demonstrate in vitro, and both subtypes of alpha agonists cause large increases in peripheral resistance in pithed rats, we tested the hypothesis that both alpha-1 and alpha-2 agonists would also constrict the rat kidney in vivo. Cannulation of the suprarenal artery and utilization of a high pressure liquid chromatography valve enabled random and reproducible intrarenal arterial bolus injections of agonists, and renal blood flow was monitored using Doppler flowmetry. Cirazoline, phenylephrine and norepinephrine bitartrate caused large renal vasopressor responses with minimal systemic effects. Although administered in a dosage range 100 to 1000 times that of alpha-1 agonists, the alpha-2 agonists (B-HT 920, UK 14,304 and guanabenz) produced only minimal renal vasoconstriction before systemic pressor effects. The low potency and efficacy of alpha-2 agonists could not be attributed to concomitant vasodilatory effects of these agents. Rat renal resistance vessels were less responsive to alpha-2 agonists than other species that have been examined. These studies are consistent with conclusions from in vitro examinations that only alpha-1 adrenoceptors mediate changes in renal vascular resistance and also autoradiographic studies reporting the localization of alpha-2 binding sites to rat renal tubules.\r"

  ".W": "Selective breeding (selection) was used to bidirectionally alter gene frequencies affecting levorphanol antinociception on the hot-plate assay in mice. After 12 generations of selective breeding, the high antinociceptive response line exhibited about 7 times steeper dose-response curve than did the low antinociceptive response line whereas only small differences were seen with saline alone. The authors sought to determine whether these large, genetically mediated differences in sensitivity bred into the high and low antinociceptive response lines (lineages) with levorphanol would also be evident with other analgesics. Should this occur with any particular drug, this would imply common mechanisms of action between that drug and levorphanol mediated by common gene action. This was found to be the case with morphine, but progressively less similarity to levorphanol was seen with other analgesics with the following rank order: morphine greater than pentazocine greater than ethylketocyclazocine greater than U-50488H greater than clonidine. Thus, the mechanisms of action for the latter compounds are different from levorphanol in varying degrees. The role of sedation produced by some of these drugs was also evaluated and was found to be independent of the antinociceptive effects. Thus, the latter was not confounded by the former in these genetic lines of mice.\r"

  ".U": "87198243\r", 
  ".W": "The interaction of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC) and related cannabinoids with opioid receptors of neuronal membranes has been investigated. Treatment of membranes with delta 9-THC consistently decreased specific in vitro binding of [3H]dihydromorphine (mu opioid) in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar dose-dependent changes were elicited by cannabidiol and (+/-)-hexahydrocannabinol. Equilibrium binding studies in which brain membranes were titrated with [3H]dihydromorphine in the presence of delta 9-THC demonstrated that the decrease in [3H]dihydromorphine binding is due to a reduction in the number of binding sites, with no significant alteration in receptor affinity. This result suggests that the interaction of delta 9-THC with opioid receptors is a noncompetitive one. Delta 9-THC also inhibited the binding of the delta opioid [3H]D-Pen2, D-Pen5-enkephalin and the opioid antagonist [3H]naloxone (Ki = 16 and 19 microM, respectively) but failed to inhibit the binding of the kappa opioid [3H]ethylketocyclazocine (after suppression of mu and delta receptor binding), the phencyclidine analog [3H]N-(1-[2-theinyl]cyclohexyl)piperidine, the dopamine antagonist [3H]spiroperidol or the muscarinic antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate. Moreover, delta 9-THC inhibited the binding of [3H]etorphine (potent opioid agonist) to solubilized, partially purified opioid receptors with a Ki value similar to that observed for the membrane-bound receptors. This finding indicates that the allosteric modulation of the opioid receptor by delta 9-THC is the result of a direct interaction with the receptor protein or with a specific protein-lipid complex and not merely the result of a perturbation of the lipid bilayer of the membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87198251\r", 
  ".W": "The longitudinal muscle of the guinea pig ileum is well known to contract in response to stimulation of either muscarinic or histamine H1 receptors. However, we found that simultaneous application of agonists to both receptors, methacholine (MeCh) and histamine (Hist), at their maximum concentrations (both at 10(-5) M), induced a contraction of the muscle with a pattern very similar to that observed with MeCh alone. In the muscle contracted by MeCh, a muscarinic antagonist, atropine, caused a transient relaxation, but a histamine H1 blocker, pyrilamine, had no effect on the tension. Experiments using pirenzepine indicated that muscarinic-M1 receptors did not seem to be involved in the mechanism of this phenomenon. The atropine-induced relaxation was not affected by phentolamine (10(-6) M), propranolol (10(-6) M) or tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M). After pretreatment of the muscle with 10(-5) M MeCh for 10 min, the contractile effect of 10(-5) M Hist was suppressed intensely for a certain time period, but that of 10(-5) M MeCh was not diminished. On the other hand, pretreatment of the muscle with 10(-5) M Hist for 10 min did not influence the contraction by either MeCh or Hist. The suppression by MeCh of the Hist action developed dependently on the concentration of MeCh and the time length of exposure to MeCh, and the persistence was temperature-dependent. Furthermore, this suppression was not surmounted by the elevation of Hist concentration. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the muscle which was immersed in the nutrient solution without CaCl2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Typically it results in progressive cervical dilatation, leading to a painless second- or early-third-trimester abortion. In most instances cervical incompetence is the result of previous obstetric or gynecologic trauma; a congenital etiology is unusual. Despite the various reported diagnostic procedures, the obstetric history and frequent visual and digital examinations during pregnancy remain the most important factors in arriving at the correct diagnosis. In spite of the fact that numerous procedures have been advocated as treatment, the McDonald purse string closure technique is by far the most simple and effective corrective surgical technique, yielding an overwhelming number of successful pregnancies.\r"

As a direct approach to establish the validity of this hypothesis, we have prepared a glycoprotein fraction (GP1) from rabbit bladder mucosal tissue and shown that it may be involved in the prevention of bacterial adherence. Immunohistochemical studies using fluorescence have demonstrated that murine antibodies raised to rabbit GP1 can be used as a semiquantitative index of glycoprotein production. The present investigation addresses the question of the species restriction of the glycoprotein--whether it is confined to the rabbit or whether a similar or identical substance occurs in other species. Using an immunoperoxidase staining technique, we have examined the genitourinary tracts of Sprague Dawley rats, Golden hamsters, and Hartley guinea pigs. Mouse anti-rabbit GP1 was used as the primary antibody with an avidin-biotin complexing system. All three species reacted well with the murine antiserum but were negative with normal sera. Semiquantitative estimates of the relative amounts of this material in different areas of the genitourinary tract showed that the distal renal tubules, renal pelvic mucosa, ureters and bladders were rich in this glycoprotein while urethra and vagina were not.\r"

Of these 9 patients 3 had temporary hemodialysis and 6 resumed continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis with the indwelling catheter. Two postoperative complications clearly were related to the continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis catheter: 1 patient required abdominal exploration for control of bleeding related to disruption of peritoneal adhesions at the time the continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis catheter was removed and 1 suffered an abscess at the catheter site 1 month after the catheter was removed. No patient experienced peritonitis during immunosuppression after transplantation. We support leaving the continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis catheter during and after transplantation to simplify pre-transplantation patient care and to avoid the possible need for temporary post-transplantation hemodialysis in many patients.\r"

We studied 53 patients with excretory urography and ultrasonography before prostatectomy. Patients with a history of microscopic or macroscopic hematuria, urolithiasis, renal failure or upper urinary tract anomalies were excluded from our study. Ultrasonography proved to be more accurate in defining prostatic size and configuration. Bladder wall thickness also was quantified more clearly with ultrasonography. We found 17 renal masses incidentally with excretory urography, although ultrasound was essential and superior to excretory urography in defining these masses in each case. We recommend that ultrasonography be used in lieu of excretory urography when imaging of the urinary tract is indicated before prostatectomy.\r"

Two patients remain on therapy for more than 30 months. The remainder have ceased treatment owing to subsequent progressive disease (5 patients), side effects (6) or noncompliance. Eleven patients who had relapse after previous endocrine ablative therapy were treated with ketoconazole. Subjective responses were frequent but long-term objective responses were rare. There was a high incidence of side effects, particularly nausea. Ketoconazole may have limited usefulness as initial therapy in patients with endocrine responsive advanced prostatic cancer. The drug can be palliative in some patients who have failed previous therapeutic modalities. Analogues of the drug should prove to have better efficacy and fewer side effects.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with heparin-induced platelet activation who are reexposed to heparin may have recurrent thrombocytopenia, intravascular thrombosis, arterial emboli, or sudden death. To permit carotid endarterectomy in two patients with confirmed heparin-induced platelet activation, we compared the efficacies of aspirin and iloprost, a stable analogue of prostacyclin, in preventing heparin-induced platelet activation. In the first patient, although aspirin prevented both in vitro heparin-induced platelet aggregation (70% without and 7.5% with aspirin) and 14C serotonin release (48% without and 0% with aspirin), intraoperative administration of heparin resulted in an increase in plasma levels of platelet factor 4 from 8 to 260 ng/ml and beta-thromboglobulin levels from 29 to 39 ng/ml. In addition, the circulating platelet count decreased from 221,000 to 174,000 microliters, and 15% spontaneous platelet aggregation was observed. Fortunately, fibrinopeptide A levels remained less than 10 ng/ml intraoperatively, and no thrombotic complications occurred. In the second patient, aspirin did not prevent heparin-induced platelet aggregation in vitro (65% without and 41% with aspirin); however, iloprost (0.01 mumol/L) prevented both in vitro heparin-induced platelet aggregation (59.5% without and 0.0% with iloprost) and 14C serotonin release (56.7% without and 0.0% with iloprost). Therefore, a continuous infusion of iloprost was begun before administration of heparin and was continued until 20 minutes after reversal of heparin with protamine. After intraoperative administration of heparin, plasma levels of platelet factor 4 increased from 19 to 200 ng/ml, and beta-thromboglobulin levels increased from 56 to 76 ng/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Carotid endarterectomy was performed in 152 patients during a 27-month period. The first 82 patients had primary closure of the arteriotomy, whereas the subsequent 70 patients underwent closure with Dacron patch angioplasty. Duplex scanning was undertaken postoperatively in 102 of these patients with a mean follow-up period of 17 months. Perioperative thrombosis occurred in two patients (1.3%), late postoperative recurrent stenosis in 14 patients (13.7%), and late postoperative occlusion in three patients (2.9%). Of the various factors investigated for their correlation with late recurrent stenosis or occlusion, only three were significant: the female sex (recurrent stenosis in 29% vs. 8%, p less than 0.05), a small (less than 4 mm) internal carotid artery (37% vs. 12%, p less than 0.05), and failure to close the arteriotomy with a patch (29% vs. 6%, p less than 0.05). The development of recurrent carotid lesions appeared independent of smoking history, antiplatelet therapy, use of a shunt, or extent of carotid plaque. These data suggest that patients with small internal carotid arteries, specifically female patients, are at greater risk for recurrent carotid stenosis. Patch angioplasty may decrease this risk and should be considered in these patients.\r"

A duplex scan was also performed 2 years postoperatively in 75 cases. Moreover, the state of the endarterectomized carotid bifurcations was documented by intravenous digital subtraction angiography during hospitalization and at 12 months. At 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after operation the rate of significant recurrent stenosis was 6%, 12%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. Approximately half of the arteries with a significant stenosis at 1 year already demonstrated this lesion with intravenous digital subtraction angiography performed 1 week after operation. Persistent significant recurrent stenosis in the remaining arteries was probably the result of excessive myointimal proliferation. This occurred with a higher frequency in women (14.8%) than in men (4.1%). The greater number of the arteries with minimally or mildly disturbed spectral waveforms 3 months after endarterectomy spontaneously normalized or remained stable during the follow-up period. On the other hand, 40% of the arteries with a significant stenosis (diameter reduction of 50% or more) at the three-month control follow-up period increased to a more severe degree of stenosis during the first postoperative year. Most of the operated arteries did not significantly change during the second year.\r"

Included in this report is a review and analysis of a 22-year experience in the vascular trauma literature with missile injuries resulting in cardioarterial or arterioarterial embolization. In-depth analysis of this collective literature review revealed small weapon caliber (79%), usually .22. Soft tissue tamponade at the injury site in the form of mediastinal hematoma, retroperitoneal hematoma, or hemopericardium preventing exsanguination occurred in 37% of cases. Cardiac and thoracic aortic entry sites represented 70% of the series with distinct patterns of peripheral vascular embolization found resulting from anatomic relationships and laminar flow. Diagnostic evaluation by means of remote x-ray screening documented 86% of the emboli and was supplemented with arteriographic studies in 36%. Direct transverse arteriotomy overlying the projectile was favored; most of the delayed embolectomies stemmed from a failure to recognize those patients with peripheral embolization and a compensated asymptomatic limb. An appropriate management plan and diagnostic algorithm for this rare vascular phenomenon have been generated by this study.\r"

These infections are characteristically foul-smelling and create immense tissue destruction. Occasionally, despite the absence of clostridial organisms, subcutaneous gas may be present. The importance of adequate surgical debridement has been emphasized. In the event of advancing, unremitting infection involving the foot, ankle guillotine amputation may be a life-saving technique. Finally, the role of host-defense mechanism in diabetes is important. Polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis and phagocytosis are energy-dependent processes that are deficient in the diabetic. Better diabetic control with maintenance of normal blood sugars and avoidance of ketoacidosis may be the key to prevention of these morbid, lower extremity infections.\r"

Successful treatment must be directed at these three primary pathologic situations. Since a limb-threatening infection carries a 25% risk of major amputation, early and prompt recognition and reporting of all foot problems are essential. Neuropathy requires total rest of the injured part. An altered host defense requires knowledge of the bacteria involved and proper use of antibiotics. It requires strict adherence to sound surgical principles that ensure debridement of all necrotic material and adequate dependent drainage of the wound while conserving as much viable skin and tissue for later revision or conservative amputations. Once sepsis is controlled, ischemic extremities can be revascularized. Because of the peculiar nature of the diabetic's vascular disease, revascularization procedures require the maximum skill and experience of the operating vascular surgeon. After revascularization, revisions or more conservative distal amputations can be achieved. Patient and physician education and understanding still remain essential not only to prevention but to successful management of all diabetic foot-related problems.\r"

A 22-year-long series of 259 vascular procedures with 100% follow-up (57% in diabetic individuals) is examined to compare these results with those of non-diabetic patients. Extensive review of predisposing factors, operative indications, preoperative medical evaluation, as well as techniques and peculiarities of angiography is rendered. Peripheral arterial case mix between the two groups is examined. The high utilization rate of solely venous conduits (94%) in diabetics compared with 76% in nondiabetics, along with anastomosis site selection, provides the most reasonable explanation for the successful outcome in both groups. Modifications in revascularization techniques contributing to successful outcome are presented. In the diabetic patients, both the cumulative graft patency rate (63%) and the limb salvage rate (77%) at 6 years were superior to those of the non-diabetics (52% and 65%, respectively). Diabetes mellitus does not predispose the person requiring revascularization for limb salvage to a lesser likelihood of success.\r"

The first (parallel) portion of the study covered 434 woman-weeks among sponge users and 494 woman-weeks among nonusers. As compared with women not using the sponge, sponge users were found to be less likely to become infected with chlamydia (relative rate, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 1.07) and gonorrhea (relative rate, 0.31 [0.16 to 0.60]) but more likely to become infected with Candida (relative rate, 2.76 [0.96 to 7.98]). Women who continued in the study were crossed over to the alternate group, with former nonusers starting to employ the sponge and vice versa. The results of this second phase were similar to those of the larger parallel study. Overall, these results suggest that women using the sponge are protected against the two most common sexually transmitted pathogens, which are also those with the most serious health consequences. However, women using the sponge should be advised they may have an increased likelihood of a vaginal infection with Candida.\r"

Members of the intervention group received a GCT consultation and were routinely followed up throughout their hospitalization.

The type and rate of hospital-acquired complications in the intervention and control groups were not significantly different. Functional status on admission and admission to the psychiatry service were predictive for the occurrence of a hospital-acquired complication. In a broadly selected population such as this, the intensity of care available through a GCT was unable to reduce the occurrence of hospital-acquired complications. However, since this is only one aspect of a GCT function, and others may be of great importance, such aspects, and more targeted populations, must be evaluated before final conclusions can be reached about GCT efficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Predictive indexes for atherosclerotic risk are imperfect, suggesting that there are predictive factors not commonly considered. Such a factor may be the white blood cell (WBC) count. Epidemiologic studies have shown correlations between the WBC count and the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. The risk of acute myocardial infarction is approximately four times as great in persons with WBC counts high in the normal range (greater than 9000/microL [9 X 10(9)/L]) as in persons with WBC counts low in the normal range (less than 6000/microL [6 X 10(9)/L]); only 50% to 65% of the excess risk of the high-count individuals is explainable by tobacco smoking (which covaries with WBC count). A high WBC count also predicts greater risk of reinfarction and of in-hospital death. Less rigorously studied, the constitutional neutropenia of Yemenite Jews appears to afford protection against atherosclerotic disease. Among WBC types, the strongest epidemiologic association has been with the neutrophil count. Such a predictive value of WBC count is plausible and satisfying, because WBCs make a major contribution to the rheologic properties of blood; alter adhesive properties under stress--including the stress of ischemia, enhancing their rheologic importance; and participate in endothelial injury, both acutely and chronically, by adhering to endothelium and damaging it with toxic oxygen compounds and proteolytic enzymes. Techniques newly developed or under development may allow us to refine the predictive value of the WBC count by combining it with measures of cell activation and/or activatability.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated whether altered insulin metabolism is a key factor behind weight loss during sarcoma growth in nongrowing mice (C57BL/6J). Fasted sarcoma-bearing mice had decreased blood glucose concentrations but unchanged levels of insulin, compared with those in pair-weighed and freely fed controls. During refeeding, insulin levels were inappropriately low for the degree of glycemia in sarcoma-bearing mice compared with those of pair-weighed and freely fed controls. Injections ip of glucose to tumor-bearing animals resulted in insulin levels comparable to postabsorptive values in healthy control animals, indicating that hypoinsulinemia in freely eating tumor-bearing animals was due to a reduced glycemic sensitivity for pancreatic insulin release. Insulin supplementation at doses [4 IU/100 g (body wt)] that increase body fat in normal animals could not protect the tumor-bearing host from progressive loss of body fat or lean tissues. Exogenous insulin in excess of endogenous insulin production did not stimulate tumor growth. Nitrogen and RNA-DNA content were significantly decreased in the quadriceps muscle of tumor-bearing mice. This reduction was independent of altered insulin levels and could not be prevented by exogenous insulin. The depressed capacity of protein synthesis in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle could be entirely attributed to the state of malnutrition in tumor-bearing animals. The sensitivity and responsiveness of protein synthesis in EDL muscles to insulin were normal in tumor-bearing mice, regardless of whether exogenous insulin exerted its effect in vivo or in vitro. This study confirms insulin resistance for glucose metabolism in an experimental sarcoma animal model. Such changes are concluded to be secondary to anorexia and necessary to counteract hypoglycemia. In non-growing sarcoma-bearing mice, malnutrition and anorexia account entirely for depressed muscle protein synthesis, which is not explained by insulin resistance at the translational level. Insulin metabolism is not a key factor behind progression of wasting in sarcoma-bearing mice, but anorexia is.\r"

Prostacyclin inhibited in a dose-dependent manner tumor cell-induced release of platelet dense granules and alpha-granules concomitant with an inhibition of platelet aggregation. Release was determined by assay of biochemical markers (serotonin for dense granules and beta-thromboglobulin for alpha-granules). A tenfold higher concentration of prostacyclin was required to inhibit completely serotonin release as compared to the concentration required for beta-thromboglobulin release. Correlative ultrastructural studies demonstrated that prostacyclin at doses of over 10 ng/ml inhibited the ultrastructural changes associated with tumor cell-induced platelet shape change and platelet granule release. Platelet aggregates exhibited the retention of granule reservoirs that could potentially be involved in long-term release of biologically active substances.\r"

  ".W": "Immunofluorescence studies have demonstrated the presence of fib (a group of fibrinogen- and fibrin-related proteins that react with antibodies raised against fibrinogen) in the stroma of several transplantable animal and autochthonous human tumors. Acceptance of these reports was tempered by the possibility of artifactual clotting and fibrinolysis associated with tumor removal or tumor transplantation and by the relatively poor histology inevitable when immunofluorescence is performed on frozen tissue sections. An immunoperoxidase study therefore was undertaken of the ductal pancreatic carcinomas induced in female LGV Syrian hamsters by N-nitroso-bis(2-oxopropyl)amine [(BOP) CAS: 60599-38-4]. Artifactual clotting and fibrinolysis associated with tumor removal were avoided by systemic anticoagulation and antifibrinolysis. Fibronectin and residual fib were prominent components of tumor stroma. Prominent fib deposits also were found in a new location: the basement membrane zones of atypical pancreatic ducts and invasive carcinomas. In contrast, fib deposits were never found in the basement membranes of blood vessels, nerves, or pancreatic acini of BOP-treated or normal animals, or in the ductal basement membranes in the normal pancreas. Ducts with marked atypicality and invasive pancreatic carcinomas frequently exhibited discontinuous basement membrane staining for fib, which often paralleled loss of staining for the integral basement membrane proteins--type IV collagen and laminin. Loss of acquired fib basement membrane staining with malignant disease progression may serve as a new marker for local tumor invasion.\r"

This demonstrates that the lamina densa is a size restrictive barrier, cationic molecules with a Stokes-Einstein radius exceeding a value between 6 to 12 nm are excluded. Monomeric and dimeric cationic ferritins were handled differently in the lamina rara externa; monomer accumulated perferentially immediately below the slit membrane whereas dimer was found within the inner regions of the rara externa, nearer to the lamina densa.\r"

  ".W": "Blood coagulation function was serially studied in 84 children with nephrotic syndrome. Fifty-eight had minimal change disease, six had focal glomerulosclerosis and 20 had other forms of renal disease associated with the nephrotic syndrome. Qualitatively similar abnormalities in fibrinogen metabolism were present in all groups with clinically overt nephrotic syndrome; plasma fibrinogen concentration and high molecular weight fibrin(ogen) complexes (HMWFC) were grossly elevated (P less than 0.001 in most groups). With disease remission fibrinogen and HMWFC concentrations decreased to the normal range, usually with concomitant transient increase in plasma fibrinolytic activity (P less than 0.02). Alterations in concentrations of other proteins involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis differed depending on the underlying cause for the nephrotic syndrome. Antithrombin III concentration was normal except in the focal glomerulosclerosis group. The results demonstrate that a coagulopathy characterized by pathological degree of thrombin action on fibrinogen complicates the nephrotic state and may be initiated by different mechanisms. It is suggested that this coagulopathy, which remits with clinical improvement, is consequent upon local intrarenal activation of the blood coagulation system.\r"

This form of crescentic glomerulonephritis is further distinguished from RPGN by frequent hypertension and the nephrotic syndrome, the absence of oligo-anuria and progression to renal failure over many months or even years.\r"

Both sera had circulating antibodies that reacted by ELISA with extracts of tubular basement membrane from several species, but failed to react significantly with extracts of glomerular basement membrane. Reactive antigen was solubilized with 6 M guanidine-HCl, 6 M urea, with reduction and alkylation, and with sodium dodecylsulfate. Digestion of the basement membrane with collagenase released relatively small quantities of antigen from the membrane, and trypsin and pepsin destroyed its antigenicity. The antigenic activity was characterized with respect to its size distribution by gel filtration and by immuno-overlay analysis of protein blots. Collectively, the results indicate that the major reactivity of both sera is directed towards a Mr 58,000 component that is unique to the tubular basement membrane. Minor reactivities toward high molecular weight components common to both glomerular and tubular basement membranes were detected by immuno-overlay analysis. This study identifies an antigen that is involved in human anti-tubular-basement-membrane-mediated tubulointerstitial nephritis, and demonstrates an advantage of the use of denaturing extraction over proteolytic methods to prepare the antigen.\r"

  ".U": "87199692\r", 
  ".W": "It has been suggested that AII-mediated renal mechanisms limit the efficacy of moderate sodium restriction in the lowering of blood pressure (BP) in hypertension. We therefore studied renal hemodynamics and sodium handling in nine essential hypertensives in balance on 200 and on a 50 mmol sodium diet, before and during ACE-inhibition (enalapril 10 mg bid for 8 days) in a cross-over fashion. BP was similar on 50 and 200 mmol Na before enalapril, the fall in BP during enalapril was significantly more pronounced on 50 mmol Na. On 50 mmol Na, GFR and filtered Na were significantly lower, and tubular reabsorption was significantly higher than on 200 mmol Na. GFR increased during enalapril in 50 but not on 200 mmol Na. Consequently, the differences in GFR and filtered load elicited by sodium restriction were no longer present during ACE-inhibition. In contrast, the differences in tubular reabsorption between 50 and 200 mmol Na persisted during enalapril. In conclusion, moderate sodium restriction, not affecting BP, can elicit a renal hemodynamic response. As this response is blunted by ACE-inhibition it is probably mediated by AII. This blunting may contribute to the increased sodium sensitivity of BP during ACE-inhibition. The adaptation of tubular sodium reabsorption is not affected by ACE-inhibition.\r"

MAb DF.3 demonstrated a P less than .01 correlation of right-sided vs left-sided reactivity. This suggested that MAb DF.3 could be used as a biologic marker for synchronous bilateral breast cancer. We hypothesized that the majority of clinically asynchronous breast cancers are really biologically synchronous. We used the immunoperoxidase technique in a similar fashion on bilateral metachronous tumors in 17 patients. DF.3 antigen expression correlated (right to left side) at P less than .01 value. This data, supported by previous information, suggests that the term \"metachronous\" breast cancer is a clinically arbitrary definition but that biologically most \"metachronous\" cancers may well be synchronous.\r"

This can be achieved by cystopexy and/or by creating a pelvic sling with a knitted polypropylene mesh. Three cases are presented in which radiotherapy was satisfactorily delivered with these techniques.\r"

  ".W": "A new method has been developed that permits constant postoperative monitoring of mean and phasic cardiac output in patients after correction of congenital heart defects. A miniature ultrasound probe is attached to the adventitia of the ascending aorta at the conclusion of the operative procedure. This is connected to the monitoring equipment by means of polyurethane-covered wires that exit the chest wall through a small stab wound. The probe can easily be removed by gentle traction when the patient's condition is stable. The technique was developed, validated, and refined in extensive animal studies, and this report describes the first series of 20 consecutive human implants, performed between August 1984 and September 1985, in which the absolute cardiac output determination obtained with the ultrasound probe at the time of its application was correlated with cardiac output as measured with a standard electromagnetic flow probe. Fourteen male and six female patients (mean age 5.5 years) were studied. Operations performed included eight atrial septal defect repairs, four procedures for tetralogy of Fallot, three ventricular septal defect repairs, three stenotic valve corrections, and two Senning operations. One operative death occurred, but no complications were related to probe application or removal. The average cardiac output in the 20 patients as measured with the ultrasound probe was 2.2 +/- 1.1 L/min (range 0.67 to 5.27 L/min). This is nearly identical to the results noted with the electromagnetic flow probe, where the mean cardiac output was 2.3 +/- 1.2 L/min (range 0.7 to 6 L/min). Regression analysis revealed a high linear correlation (r = 0.9) between the two techniques. A monitor can display the cardiac output trend with 1 minute updates, which greatly enhance management of intravenous drug therapy and volume administration. In conclusion, this new extraluminal removable probe allows virtually continuous monitoring of the postoperative cardiac output after correction of congenital heart defects and should become a standard technique in the postoperative care of these patients.\r"

All hearts were arrested in situ by perfusing 4 degrees C cardioplegic solution into the aortic root and were stored by a nonperfused cold storage technique for 5 hours at 4 degrees C. The hearts were then transplanted orthotopically with the use of topical iced slush alone or with infusions of either blood cardioplegic solution or one of two crystalloid cardioplegic solutions after each atrial anastomosis. Five dog hearts were included in each group. Biopsy samples to test for adenylates were taken before the arrest, at the end of storage, before cross-clamp removal, and 3.5 hours after cross-clamp removal. The dogs were removed from cardiopulmonary bypass, and with the chest open, left ventricular function curves were measured at 1, 2, and 3 hours after cross-clamp removal. At 3.5 hours of reperfusion time, a full-width section was obtained from the left ventricle for measurement of tissue sodium and water content. No differences in tissue water, sodium, or potassium content were found among the groups. Left ventricular function was significantly better in the blood cardioplegia group than in any other groups. Adenosine triphosphate levels were significantly reduced 3.5 hours after reperfusion in the crystalloid cardioplegia groups but were not significantly depressed at any other measurement time. Excellent early graft function was observed after crystalloid cardioplegic arrest and blood cardioplegic reperfusion during graft implantation.\r"

Early attempts at human xenotransplantation achieved minimal success. However, the effectiveness of cyclosporine in nonhuman xenotransplant models has received little experimental investigation. We have therefore studied the effect of cyclosporine-based immunosuppression in primate cardiac xenograft models using cynomolgus monkey donors and baboon recipients. Donor hearts were transplanted heterotopically into the necks of recipients or in the orthotopic position. Recipients were treated with no immunosuppression (controls), cyclosporine and steroids, or cyclosporine, steroids, azathioprine, and antithymocyte globulin. Statistically significant prolongation of graft survival compared to the control group was observed in the heterotopic groups. Mean survival time of the cyclosporine-treated and steroid-treated heterotopic grafts was 61 days compared to 6 days for grafts in the control group (p = 0.01); the addition of azathioprine and antithymocyte globulin yielded a mean survival of 84 days (p less than 0.01). No significant increase in graft survival was noted in the orthotopic groups treated with either immunosuppressive regimen. Although long-term use of human xenografts as an alternative for heart replacement is not supported by these data, further investigation of the orthotopic model is clearly justified.\r"

In the open chest group, application of positive end-expiratory pressure produced only a slight decrease of cardiac index. After right ventricular damage a decrease of cardiac index of more than 25% occurred only when higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure were applied. In contrast to the open chest group, the closed chest group showed more distinct cardiovascular responses after positive end-expiratory pressure. In the damaged right ventricle with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 16 cm H2O, right ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased more than 100%. With positive end-expiratory pressure, cardiac index decreased 34% before and 47% after right ventricular damage. We conclude that positive end-expiratory pressure induces a more pronounced decrease in cardiac index if right ventricular function is impaired. During open chest conditions with lower levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, these changes are only small, however, and probably irrelevant. During closed chest conditions, the hemodynamic changes are much more pronounced. High right ventricular end-diastolic pressures resulting from impaired right ventricular contractility as well as from high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure may have an impact on biventricular function and right ventricular coronary driving pressure.\r"

The ultimate goal of DNA-based diagnosis is the determination of the causative mutation, but, in general, this is possible only for large deletions, insertions, or certain nonsense mutation that, in most diseases, involve only a few percent of affected families. If direct diagnosis of the carrier state or fetal disease state is not feasible, indirect diagnosis can be performed by following the segregation of linked polymorphisms through the family pedigree. For such indirect diagnosis, DNA from multiple family members must be analyzed. Although this procedure is highly accurate in many families, errors can potentially occur because of meiotic recombination, genetic heterogeneity, new mutations, and nonpaternity. In this review, a general introduction to DNA-based diagnosis of mendelian diseases is presented and the methods and strategy are outlined. The use of these techniques for the diagnosis of hemophilia A is then described to illustrate the principles of diagnosis and to highlight some of the complexities encountered. DNA-based diagnosis is in its infancy and has the potential to revolutionize preventive medicine.\r"

The EMIT-dau screening test with a sensitivity limit of 20 ng/ml is highly satisfactory for screening for the absence of marijuana in the urine. This test has a virtual 100% true-negative rate as long as an unadulterated urine specimen is analyzed. Positive results by the EMIT-dau procedure are presumptive because the test seems to produce false-positive results when applied to a random population of suspected drug users. In a population in a specific clinical environment such as in drug-treatment programs in which 20 of every 100 specimens will yield positive THC-COOH results by EMIT-dau screening, 3 (15%) of the 20 positive results will likely be false-positive. Our experience with the EMIT-dau suggests that of 100 test results, 3 will be false-positive, an overall 3% false-positive rate. If a positive test result will put the patient in considerable jeopardy and the screening result is the only evidence of drug use, confirmatory testing is imperative. Of the confirmatory tests, GC/MS seems to have the specificity necessary to provide a high level of confidence in the results. A combination of the EMIT procedure with a sensitivity level of 20 ng/ml and GC/MS confirmation yields virtually 100% accuracy in detection of marijuana abuse.\r"

  ".W": "Because of the increasing application of stereotactic neurosurgical techniques not only in the diagnosis but also in the treatment of brain tumors, a demand for data regarding the spatial delimitation of gliomas is being created. Traditional histologic criteria were not established for detecting isolated tumor cells located at the boundaries of gliomas. Standard histologic techniques used for processing surgical specimens result in preparations of insufficient quality to allow the detection of minimal tumor infiltrates within normal brain parenchyma. Consequently, histologic examination has been considered an unreliable method of determining the boundaries of gliomas. In this study, we describe in detail an improved technique of biopsy specimen preparation that involves the use of glutaraldehyde-fixed and hemalum-phloxine-stained paraffin sections as well as alcohol-fixed and hemalum-phloxine-stained smears. In concert, these methods allow visualization of delicate cytologic details and are complementary in assessing the presence of isolated tumor cells at the periphery of gliomas. We define morphologic criteria for the accurate identification of isolated neoplastic cells and for their distinction from normal or reactive glial elements. These morphologic criteria include classic cytologic features of malignant lesions (such as nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromasia) as well as the assessment of tumor architecture and cellular spatial relationships.\r"

The 39 patients were classified as having one of three types of tumor: type I (1 patient), which consisted only of circumscribed tumor tissue; type II (26 patients), which consisted of tumor tissue and isolated tumor cells; or type III (11 patients), which consisted of intact parenchyma infiltrated by isolated tumor cells. (In one patient, the biopsy sampling was inadequate for determining the type of tumor.) In high-grade lesions, tumor tissue was obtained from CT contrast-enhancing regions, and the area of enhancement accurately defined the tumor tissue volume. In low-grade lesions, tumor tissue was hypodense and indistinguishable from parenchyma infiltrated by isolated tumor cells on both CT and MRI. Isolated tumor cells usually extended as far as the prolongation of T2 on T2-weighted MRI of high-grade and low-grade tumors. CT and MRI detection of boundaries and stereotactic serial biopsies are necessary for the demarcation of glial neoplasms into tumor tissue and isolated tumor cell volumes as well as for the determination of the spatial extent of each component. This information is important for determining appropriate treatment.\r"

  ".W": "After occlusion of the right common carotid artery in the gerbil, we monitored the progression of ischemic damage and postischemic damage and the repair process in the brain immunohistochemically by using tubulin, creatine kinase BB-isoenzyme (CK-BB), and neuron-specific enolase as the neuronal markers and astroprotein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and CK-BB as the astrocytic markers. The earliest ischemic lesion was detected in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex after ischemia for 5 minutes as loss of the reaction in the neuropil, nerve cell bodies, and dendrites. The reaction disappeared more promptly in the dendrites than in the nerve cell bodies. The reaction for tubulin was the most sensitive for detection of the neuronal ischemic damage. After an ischemic period of 30 minutes and subsequent reestablishment of cerebral circulation, the immunohistochemical lesions affecting the neuronal structure expanded during the first 3 hours and then slowly afterward for up to 12 hours. Reactive astrocytes were already identified 24 hours after reperfusion. The current investigation demonstrated that early ischemic damage can be clearly visualized by use of the immunohistochemical technique soon after the onset of cerebral ischemia but that considerable heterogeneity exists not only in different anatomic regions but also within the neuronal structure. This technique has potential for further investigation of cerebral ischemia or other pathophysiologic conditions when used in combination with other morphologic, physiologic, or biochemical techniques.\r"

Isoproterenol and atropine induced small decreases in total respiratory resistance at most frequencies, and isoproterenol decreased resonant frequency slightly (P less than 0.01). After administration of both methacholine and histamine, resonance frequency increased (P less than 0.01) and total respiratory resistance became more frequency-dependent, increasing mainly in the lower frequency range. In six of the subjects, we attempted to produce central deposition of methacholine by rapid, shallow breathing and peripheral deposition of the drug by slow, deep breathing. Only two subjects had suggestive evidence of central bronchoconstriction. No difference was noted, however, in the impedance behavior with either type of breathing. In awake humans, impedance analysis does not seem to distinguish between central and peripheral airway constriction.\r"

The major clinical features were dyspnea, cough, fever, and chest pain. Chest roentgenograms usually showed bilateral symmetric alveolar infiltrates, but asymmetric, unilateral, and chronic patchy patterns were also noted. Diagnosis was established by thoracotomy-lung biopsy in 26 patients. Histologic analysis revealed uniform filling of the alveoli by periodic acid-Schiff-positive material and maintenance of normal alveolar architecture. Electron microscopy showed enlarged alveolar macrophages with lamellar osmiophilic inclusions, dense granules, and myeloid bodies. Of the 21 patients who underwent therapeutic bronchoalveolar lavage, 13 had no recurrence of the disease during a mean follow-up of 8.8 years. In patients who underwent pulmonary function testing both before and after lavage, significant restrictive dysfunctions present before the procedure were alleviated afterward. Three deaths occurred among the 34 patients. Pulmonary alveolar phospholipoproteinosis may result from defective clearance of phospholipids by the alveolar macrophages, excessive production of phospholipids by type II pneumocytes, or both. It is likely a nonspecific response to a variety of injuries to the alveolar macrophage or type II pneumocyte or both, including exposure to certain dusts and chemicals and occurrence of hematologic diseases or infections. The uncommon occurrence of this disorder suggests individual susceptibility.\r"

Once a patient is so identified, preoperative pulmonary-function studies are indicated. The optimal screening studies for most patients are spirometry and arterial blood gas analysis. Patients who are identified as having marginal function by screening techniques should be studied further by more specialized studies, including radioisotopic evaluation of regional lung function. If a patient is identified as an operative candidate, but one who has increased risk of postoperative morbidity, prophylactic measures should be instituted to reduce postoperative complications. The essence of such measures is increased care preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. The use of preoperative evaluation of pulmonary function presents a different magnitude of problem in defining the risk of morbidity in contrast to that of mortality. Available data provide a firm basis for the identification of the patient at increased risk of morbidity. After 23 years and dozens of spirometric studies involving thousands of patients, it is apparent that there is no spirometric number, percentage, or category that will absolutely separate the operable from the inoperable patient. There are estimates of risk--guidelines, to be sure--but no absolutes. The patient whose lung function would have been considered to prohibit lung resection in the 1950s has been successfully operated on in the 1980s. In dealing with the risk of mortality, the physician should always bear in mind that, although statistics apply to groups, they often do not apply to individual patients.\r"

Controversial therapies, such as the use of corticosteroids and the utility of newer pharmacologic approaches, are beginning to be properly tested in multicenter trials. Improvements in technology (e.g., development of monoclonal antibodies), biochemistry, and pharmacology have resulted in the development of exciting, new pharmacologic avenues for the management of the critically ill perioperative patient.\r"

Sometimes, however, surgery will not be considered in a geriatric patient because of mistaken underestimation of life expectancy. The medical consultant is charged with confirming that surgery represents the consequence of the patient's informed decision, a task that is usually time consuming and often difficult. The medical consultant next identifies patient-related and procedure-related factors that affect surgical morbidity and mortality. General physiologic declines in all organ systems are characteristic of aging, but the most important ones affecting surgical risk are those of cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunologic, and central nervous systems. These systems must be assessed by an orderly preoperative evaluation that aims to optimize the patient's status and anticipate and minimize postoperative complication.\r"

Adverse factors were age, amyloidosis, ischaemic heart disease, convulsions, and acute presentation. Beneficial variables were male sex, parenthood, pyelonephritis, and residence in Leicestershire. By correcting for the influence of these variables and using time-dependent treatment co-variates, the bias adjusted estimates of the relative risk of death were 1 for patients on CAPD, 1.30 for those on haemodialysis, and 1.09 for patients who received transplants. These risks do not differ significantly from one another and suggest that CAPD is at least as effective as haemodialysis or transplantation at preserving life.\r"

The CO2 miliwatt laser offers the advantages of tissue welding, as well as cutting and ablation by virtue of the small spot size produced combined with low power output. Potential applications include microvascular and microneural anastomoses. The milliwatt laser can be used endoscopically for tissue resection with a high degree of precision with power densities comparable to current CO2 lasers. Moreover, the milliwatt laser can be applied to otology for cutting and welding of the tympanic membrane, tissue removal, and stapedotomy.\r"

Therefore, age should not be viewed as a bona fide occupational qualification. Instead, each individual should be judged on the basis of his or her functional capabilities. This paper discusses the concept of functional or physiologic age and then considers how functional age can be determined in a specific job-related context. Physiologic age is viewed as a generalized measure of senescence that would be a useful tool for research studies on aging. Functional age could employ many of the marker variables used in the physiologic age (VO2max, strength, etc.) in a task-specific manner. However, since all the variables involve assumptions concerning the rate of decline with age, they may not stand up in a courtroom test. Therefore, the regular use of job-related tests is recommended as an alternative to the use of chronologic or functional age to determine a person's ability to perform on the job.\r"

  ".W": "Most rheumatologic and vasculitic syndromes can affect the central nervous system (CNS). In the vast majority of cases, however, the systemic disease is present at the time of first CNS manifestations. Certain of these diseases, including SLE, PSS, Behcet syndrome, cryoglobulinemia and lymphomatoid granulomatoses can present with CNS findings in the absence of any peripheral evidence of the underlying process. The CNS presentations of these and the other rheumatologic and vasculitic syndromes which may affect the CNS are discussed. Isolated CNS vasculitis may be due to granulomatous angiitis of the nervous system (GANS) or delayed contralateral hemiplegia following HZO. These are distinct clinical entities which can be differentiated by clinical and angiographic findings. The former is often severe and diffuse in nature, whereas the latter is usually milder and more focal. There are few if any peripheral findings in either syndrome. The cause of GANS is unknown, but the hemiplegia following HZO is clearly due to a virus-induced vasculitis spread from the overlying Gasserian nucleus; the history of preceding herpes zoster ophthalmicus strongly suggests the diagnosis. The collected evidence suggests that an aggressive evaluation, including meningeal biopsy, and early therapy with steroids (and perhaps cytotoxic agents) can alter the prognosis in GANS. It is not clear that hemiplegia following HZO requires treatment. GANS and HZO-associated CNS damage should be considered in the differential diagnosis of isolated CNS dysfunction in the absence of history, signs, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of systemic disease.\r"

We investigated the sucrose-splitting effect of viable yeast cells in eight children with congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency, by means of the sucrose hydrogen breath test. This test is based on the fact that hydrogen is released from the malabsorbed sucrose by the colonic microflora. We found that 0.3 g of lyophilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae, given after loading with 2 g of sucrose per kilogram of body weight, reduced hydrogen excretion in all patients, on average by 70 percent, in parallel with a complete loss or evident reduction of clinical symptoms. In vitro, lyophilized and fresh S. cerevisiae (fresh baker's yeast) had appreciable sucrase activity, a low isomaltase and maltase activity, and virtually no lactase activity. The sucrase activity was more inhibited by undiluted than by diluted gastric juice. We conclude that patients with congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency who intentionally or unintentionally consume sucrose can ameliorate the malabsorption by subsequently ingesting a small amount of viable yeast cells, preferably on a full stomach.\r"

  ".W": "We infused small doses of insulin (0.3 mU per kilogram of body weight per minute; range, 0.9 to 1.7 U per hour) for three hours into 8 subjects who did not have diabetes, 11 patients with well-controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1, 7.6 +/- 0.7 percent), and 10 patients with poorly controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1, 11.5 +/- 1.7 percent) to simulate the mild peripheral hyperinsulinemia observed during insulin treatment. Normoglycemia was established in the patients during the night before study. During the insulin infusion, the plasma glucose level stabilized at 60 to 70 mg per deciliter (3.3 to 3.9 mmol per liter) in the subjects without diabetes and the patients with poorly controlled diabetes, because of a rebound increase in hepatic glucose production. In contrast, hypoglycemia developed in the patients with well-controlled diabetes (42 +/- 2 mg of glucose per deciliter, or 2.3 +/- 0.1 mmol per liter, P less than 0.01) as glucose production remained suppressed. The hypoglycemia in the patients with well-controlled diabetes was associated with a lowering of the plasma threshold of glucose that triggered a release of epinephrine (less than 45 mg of glucose per deciliter, or 2.5 mmol per liter, vs. greater than 55 mg per deciliter, or 3.1 mmol per liter, in the other groups, P less than 0.01) as well as an enhanced sensitivity to the suppressive effects of insulin on hepatic glucose production. Nearly identical disturbances in glucose counterregulation and decreased perception of hypoglycemia developed when four of the subjects with poorly controlled diabetes were restudied after intensive treatment. We conclude that strict control of diabetes induces physiologic alterations (delayed release of epinephrine and persistent suppression of glucose production) that impair glucose counterregulation to doses of insulin in the therapeutic range. These defects may contribute to the increased incidence of severe hypoglycemia reported during intensive insulin therapy.\r"

In a randomized clinical trial in 261 men with disseminated germ-cell tumors, we substituted etoposide for the vinblastine in this regimen in half the patients to compare the efficacy and toxicity of the two treatments. Among 244 patients who could be evaluated for a response, 74 percent of those receiving the regimen including vinblastine and 83 percent of those receiving the regimen including etoposide became disease-free with or without subsequent surgery (P not significant). Among the 157 patients with high tumor volume, 61 percent became disease-free on the regimen that included vinblastine, as compared with 77 percent on the regimen that included etoposide (P less than 0.05). Survival among the patients who received etoposide was higher (P = 0.048). The regimens were similar in terms of myelosuppressive effects and pulmonary toxicity. However, the etoposide regimen caused substantially fewer paresthesias (P = 0.02), abdominal cramps (P = 0.0008), and myalgias (P = 0.00002). We conclude that etoposide with cisplatin and bleomycin is superior to vinblastine with cisplatin and bleomycin in the treatment of disseminated germ-cell tumors because of diminished neuromuscular toxicity and, among patients with advanced disease, better efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "Although the presence in the recipient of preformed antibodies to HLA antigens in the kidney of a renal-transplant donor may be associated with early graft failure, such grafts are often well tolerated. We have investigated the possibility that anti-anti-HLA (antiidiotypic) antibodies influence the outcome of renal transplantation in recipients with a history of presensitization to their donor's HLA antigens. A retrospective analysis of 20 such cases showed that in 10 patients the transplanted kidney was rejected within one month, whereas in the remaining 10 the graft was tolerated for more than a year. Nine of the 10 patients in whom the graft was tolerated had anti-anti-HLA antibodies at the time of transplantation. Nine of the 10 patients in whom the graft was rejected had antibodies that potentiated, rather than blocked, the cytotoxic activity of anti-donor-HLA antibodies. These results suggest that patients with anti-anti-HLA antibodies specific for a potential donor can safely undergo transplantation, despite a prior history of anti-HLA antibodies. At the time of transplantation, patients who have antibodies that potentiate the cytotoxic activity of a historically positive serum are at high risk of graft rejection within a short period. Taking these considerations into account may improve the reliability of cross-matching in renal transplantation.\r"

To understand how T cells develop in the thymus, it is important to determine the lineage relationships among these subpopulations. In particular, the status of double positives, which make up approximately 80% of the total thymocyte population, has long been controversial. Some purpose that double positives are 'dead-end cells' that all die in the thymus, perhaps because they have been rejected by some selection process. Others suggest that, although most double positives die in the thymus, some develop into the more mature single positives that leave the thymus. The experiments presented here show that repeated injections of anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies block the development of CD4+ cells, demonstrating that these cells develop from CD8+ precursors, probably double positive thymocytes, in vivo.\r"

Phosphofructokinase in Escherichia coli is such an enzyme, being inhibited by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and activated by ADP and GDP. How do individual interactions with effectors affect the balance between activation and inhibition, especially when both ligands share aspects of the same binding site? We find that mutation of a single residue in the effector site, Glu----Ala 187, leads to PEP being an activator rather than an inhibitor. With low concentrations of the substrate fructose-6-phosphate, the mutant enzyme is more than one hundred times more active than wild-type enzyme at millimolar concentrations of PEP. The classical Monod-Wyman-Changeux two-state model is too simple to account for the properties of the mutant enzyme.\r"

  ".W": "The repressor of phage 434 binds to six operator sites on the phage chromosome. A comparison of the sequences of these 14-base-pair (bp) operator sites reveals a striking pattern: at five of the six sites, the symmetrically arrayed outer eight base pairs (four in each half-site) are identical and the remaining site differs at only one position (Fig. 1b). In contrast, the sequences of the inner four base pairs are highly variable. Crystallographic analysis of the repressor-operator complex shows that at each half-site, the 'recognition alpha-helix' of the repressor is positioned in the major groove such that it could contact the outermost five base pairs, but not the innermost two (Fig. 1a). We show in this paper that the sequence of the central base pairs of the operator (two in each half-site) have a significant role in determining operator affinity for repressor, despite the evidence presented here and in the accompanying paper that these base pairs are not contacted by repressor. We also show that these central base pairs influence operator affinity for Cro, a second gene regulatory protein encoded by phage 434. We discuss the likely structural basis for this evidently indirect, but sequence-dependent, effect of the central base pairs of the operator on its affinity for the two regulatory proteins.\r"

We have identified an amino acid-base pair contact that determines (in part) the DNA-binding specificity of 434 repressor. The identification is based on the properties of a 'new-specificity' mutant, named Repressor [Ala 28], which bears the substitution of Ala for Gln at the first residue of its recognition alpha-helix. Repressor [Ala 28] binds with high affinity to a particular doubly mutant operator bearing the same substitution at position 1 in each half-site, but does not bind to either the wild-type operator or to other mutant operators. We describe molecular models of residue 28-base pair 1 interactions that account for the binding specificities of both the mutant and wild-type proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Regularly spaced repeated morphological structures are a common developmental theme among higher eukaryotes. In Drosophila, this is evident in the repeated segments of the larval and the adult cuticle. It has been demonstrated through cell transplantation and more recently through molecular techniques that these repeated segmental units are established as early as nuclear cycle 14 in the blastoderm embryo. A number of genes have been shown to express their transcripts, and in two instances their protein products, in a spatially restricted manner at this early stage. Immunofluorescence probes against the protein product of one such gene, fushi tarazu (ftz), reveal that it is distributed in seven evenly spaced stripes across the cellularized cycle-14 blastoderm embryo. The mechanisms that determine such spatial patterns of gene expression are of fundamental importance for the development of multicellular organisms, but in no case are they well understood. Here we examine the ftz pattern on blastoderm embryos derived from maternal-haploid 1182 (mh 1182) and daughterless-abo-like (dal) females which possess cell densities and sizes both above and below the wild-type levels. The number, spacing and width of the ftz protein positive bands are not altered in these abnormal embryos relative to the wild-type pattern, suggesting that the mechanism by which distance is measured with respect to the ftz protein is independent of cell size and density.\r"

  ".U": "87201963\r", 
  ".W": "One of the most important inhibitory modulators of synaptic transmission in mammalian brain is adenosine. At some cholinergic terminals, adenosine is known to inhibit further release of acetylcholine. It is unclear whether adenosine is released directly at the synapse or whether ATP is co-released with transmitter and hydrolysed to adenosine in the synaptic cleft. Methods used in the past for isolating nerve terminals have not yielded homogeneous preparations, making it impossible to determine whether sufficient ATP or adenosine is released at specific synapses for inhibition of transmitter release to occur. Immunoaffinity purification techniques have recently permitted the preparation of homogeneous populations of cholinergic nerve terminals, which release ATP upon stimulation. We now report that in immunoisolated cholinergic nerve terminals from the striatum synaptic ectophosphohydrolases convert this ATP to adenosine, which inhibits further acetylcholine release, but this inhibitory effect is not seen in cortical cholinergic terminals lacking the complete ectophosphohydrolase pathway. Therefore the differing adenosine-mediated modulation in different brain areas is controlled by the presence and activity of synaptic ectophosphohydrolases.\r"

Stereotactic aspiration allows evacuation of pus, accurate bacteriological diagnosis, selection of an optimal antibiotic regimen, and instillation of antibiotics directly into the abscess cavity. In two of the three cases described here, the abscess reaccumulated after initial aspiration despite appropriate maximal medical therapy. A repeat aspiration was required before resolution occurred. We conclude that medical management alone is not adequate for some cases of brain stem abscess. There was no morbidity that could be attributed to the procedure, suggesting that the risk of stereotactic aspiration is probably quite low and is likely to be less than the risk of incorrect diagnosis, suboptimal choice of antibiotics, or progression of the lesion despite appropriate maximal medical therapy.\r"

Metaplasias, atypical hyperplasias, dysplasias, and in situ carcinomas characteristically rested on an essentially intact basement membrane, although minor disruptions were seen, occasionally in association with inflammation. Superficially and deeply invasive adenocarcinomas and squamous carcinomas exhibited impaired laminin production. In well differentiated carcinomas of the endometrium and cervix, an intact basement membrane was often seen around infiltrating glandular and squamous elements, although focal reduplications and small disruptions were seen in all cases. In high-grade carcinomas, considerable impairment of basement membrane integrity was seen, but immunostainable laminin was still evident, at least focally, in all cases. The findings confirm that endometrial and cervical carcinomas, even those of high histologic grade, are capable of basement membrane production.\r"

For Chlamydia trachomatis, the predictive value of a positive test ranged from 0.40-1.00. Cytologic diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases has not been studied adequately, but the available literature suggests that its sensitivity is low. In general, the Papanicolaou smear should not be used to diagnose sexually transmitted diseases, and treatment should not be based on cytologic findings alone. At best, cytologic indications of sexually transmitted diseases should prompt a definitive laboratory test.\r"

It is recommended that the magnitude of the cardiac circumference as a function of any or all of these variables be used as an index of organ size when assessing fetuses at risk for anomalous cardiac development.\r"

To evaluate its efficacy and side effects, we conducted a double-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing Lamicel with multiple laminaria for cervical dilation in 219 patients before second-trimester abortion. A single Lamicel produced significantly less initial dilation (two-tailed P value = .03) than did multiple laminaria, but the techniques had comparable degrees of difficulty in subsequent dilation to 43 French units (two-tailed P value greater than .05) and rates of achieving dilation of 43 French units with rigid dilators (relative risk 1.0; 95% confidence interval 0.9-1.1). Lamicel removal resulted in a significantly lower rate of bleeding from the os (relative risk 0.3; 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.5). Because of its greater convenience, lower cost per patient, and comparable efficacy, Lamicel appears to be an attractive alternative to multiple laminaria for cervical dilation before abortion at 14-16 menstrual weeks' gestation.\r"

Fetal age was confirmed by biparietal diameter (BPD) measurements obtained before 21 weeks. Pourcelot's Index, calculated from Doppler sonograms recorded with a noninvasive technique from small arteries in the myometrium and from an umbilical cord artery, did not correlate with the duration of the pregnancy beyond term. However, this \"resistance index\" of Pourcelot was higher in the umbilical cord arteries of fetuses with a worse clinical outcome. Doppler blood cell velocity in the fetal descending aorta correlated significantly and negatively with the prolongation of gestation. Fetal aortic velocities appeared to be lower in fetuses who passed meconium before delivery. Our findings suggest that fetal compromise in prolonged pregnancy is more a fetal-placental problem than a uteroplacental problem.\r"

  ".W": "A noninvasive pulsed Doppler ultrasound technique was used to characterize blood flow in the descending thoracic aorta and the intra-abdominal part of the umbilical vein in 159 fetuses suspected of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) on the basis of ultrasound fetometry. From this group, 74 infants with IUGR (defined as gestational age-related birth weight of 2 standard deviations [SD] or more below the population mean) were born. The blood flow results were not available to the clinicians managing the pregnancies. Blood flow mean velocity in the fetal aorta was lower, pulsatility index and rising slope higher, and umbilical volume flow and umbilical flow per 100 g placental tissue were lower in the pregnancies with IUGR than in 21 normal pregnancies. The waveform of the maximum aortic velocity envelope was related to operative delivery for fetal distress, Apgar score, and umbilical cord blood pH. The pulsatility index and the configurational assessment of the diastolic part of the waveform were combined to form a new concept, the blood flow class. The blood flow class was abnormal in 57% of the fetuses classified as having IUGR at birth and in 93% of those growth-retarded fetuses who subsequently developed signs of fetal distress requiring operative delivery. Waveform analysis, in terms of blood flow class, seems to be a useful tool in the surveillance of fetuses when IUGR is suspected. Abnormal blood flow class is a marker of fetal distress and probably gives an earlier indication than antenatal nonstressed cardiotocography. The results of this study point to a strong association between IUGR and impaired fetal blood flow. The aortic volume blood flow, unlike waveform analysis, does not seem to be a variable sensitive enough to predict fetal outcome in the individual pregnancy.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether antepartum fetal assessment can predict whether a postterm fetus with heavy meconium in early labor is at low or high risk for an adverse perinatal outcome. Eight hundred thirty-nine postterm patients were followed with antepartum testing, consisting of twice-weekly fetal heart rate (FHR) testing and ultrasonic amniotic fluid volume estimation. Overall, patients with heavy meconium in early labor had a significantly greater frequency of fetal distress. However, when women with heavy meconium in early labor were separated according to their antepartum testing results, those with normal results were found to have no greater risk for fetal distress or perinatal morbidity than women with normal testing and subsequently clear amniotic fluid. These findings suggest that postterm patients with heavy meconium in early labor and normal antepartum testing can be managed in labor in the same manner as low-risk patients without meconium.\r"

Using high-resolution ultrasound equipment, it is possible to demonstrate physiologic herniation of the midgut, which usually occurs between eight and nine weeks' gestation (calculated by last menstrual period). Fourteen cases have been studied with weekly ultrasound examinations between seven and 12 weeks' gestation. This herniation varied to a large extent in the different embryos depending on the amount of protruding intestine. In embryologic terms, the return of the intestine into the peritoneal cavity, and its rotation and fixation to the posterior abdominal wall, should be concluded at ten to 12 weeks. In all cases studied, the persistence of umbilical herniation could be ruled out by sonographic visualization of the umbilical cord insertion between ten and 12 weeks. Therefore, the suspicion of a severe congenital abdominal wall defect, such as omphalocele, umbilical herniation, or gastroschisis can reliably be confirmed only after 12 weeks' gestation.\r"

Plasma androstenedione was augmented by 27-39% at physiologic insulin concentrations in the normal subjects and the obese group, and by 25% at hyperinsulinemic levels in the insulin-resistant group with acanthosis nigricans. The increased androstenedione concentrations achieved in the normal females and obese females were similar to the hyperandrogenemic levels seen in the acanthotic subjects in the basal state. Plasma cortisol also increased in all groups from 19% in normal females to 135% in obese females during the insulin infusions, but these changes did not reach statistical significance.

We have reviewed in detail the literature published since 1974 and estimated the probabilities of various outcomes after different treatment strategies. We conclude that a policy of selected vaginal delivery will result in four perinatal deaths for every 1000 patients delivered. A similar probability of neurologic handicap, at least until discharge from hospital, can also be attributed to this method of delivery. These unfavorable outcomes were reported less frequently in more recent reports covering the years since 1974. In these cases, the probability of fetal death due to a trial of vaginal delivery is approximately two in 1000. Cesarean section rates have risen, however, and 18-40% of trials of labor for breech presentation now result in \"emergency\" cesarean section. Decision analysis has demonstrated that a policy of elective cesarean section for all cases would not necessarily increase maternal mortality and morbidity. Thus the greater dangers of emergency compared with nonelective surgery may abolish the advantages of attempting a vaginal delivery. Depending on the relative dangers of elective and emergency cesarean section, planned delivery becomes the safer option when 16-30% of trials of vaginal breech delivery are unsuccessful. The strength and limitations of this probabilistic approach to the breech presentation are discussed in detail.\r"

The mean donor age in the Ventilator group (26.4 years) was significantly less than in the Control group (45.8 years, P less than 0.0001). Mean time on the ventilator was 99.4 hours (range, 4 hours to 21 days). Overall graft survival rates in the Ventilator and Control groups were similar (P greater than or equal to 0.72). Time on the ventilator did not affect graft survival. Cultures of corneoscleral donor rims were positive more often in the Ventilator group than in Controls (39.7 versus 23.1%), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.09). Prolonged ventilator time was not associated with a higher rate of positive corneoscleral rim cultures, nor did positive cultures affect graft survival. The most common cause of graft failure in both groups was allograft rejection. In no case could postoperative bacterial infection be attributed to contamination of the donor material. One case of primary donor failure occurred in the Ventilator group, but the incidence (1.2%) is similar to that of previously reported studies. The data indicate that corneal tissue from ventilator-supported donors should be considered for use in penetrating keratoplasty.\r"

An unusual finding was a localized equatorial nodule in the right eye that stained with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies, and showed lipid infiltrates in its margin and base. The equatorial retina showed marked gliosis of the outer layers. Photoreceptor cells were present only in the posterior retina, macula, and focally, in the far periphery.

Greater than 94% sensitivity and 99% specificity was achieved with each of the ELISA test kits using cadaveric sera. The Western blot method gave 97.1% sensitivity compared with the autopsy-proven diagnosis of AIDS. Positive results were obtained on sera from AIDS cadavers even if the time of blood draw was delayed 35 hours from death and the time of sera preparation was delayed up to 176 days. False-negative or false-positive ELISA results did not appear to correlate with hemolysis or any parameter of sera preparation. In contrast to the high sensitivity in testing sera, only 16 to 26% of aqueous humor samples from AIDS cadavers were ELISA-positive and 79% were positive by Western blot. These results indicate that three commercially available ELISA test kits are an effective means of screening cadaveric sera for antibodies to HIV, but that aqueous humor cannot be reliably substituted for cadaveric sera to screen potential cornea donors by an ELISA assay.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy institutionalized severely and profoundly retarded patients were administered intramuscular butorphanol, 1.0 to 4.0 mg, for premedication prior to dental procedures. These patients had been refractory to previous combined chloral hydrate and diphenhydramine treatment. Clinical efficacy was categorized according to the extent that adjunctive restraints were required to accomplish the dental procedure. A total of 151 butorphanol trials were recorded. Butorphanol was observed to be clinically effective in 74.8% of the administrations and sedation was observed in 28.2% of the trials. Dosage titration increased efficacy to 85.0%. Contribution of concurrent central nervous system depressant medication to clinical efficacy and dose requirements lacked statistical significance; however, a strong trend (p = 0.068) was found in the medication-free group with higher dosage. Vomiting (2.6%) was the most frequent adverse effect observed. One patient had marked cardiorespiratory depression that was promptly reversed by intravenous naloxone. Two patients experienced mild hypotensive episodes immediately following injection, but they recovered uneventfully. Butorphanol was shown to be a safe and effective agent for dental premedication in this difficult patient population.\r"

Some of the behavioral literature presents an inaccurate picture of amputees who have phantom pain. This apparently happened because many of the data were gathered from those amputees requesting treatment for phantom pain who were referred to mental health professionals. We conclude that phantom pain is similar to other chronic pain syndromes in that episodes are greatly influenced by psychological factors such as stress and depression. Repeated requests for treatment are influenced by personality structure. There is no convincing evidence that major personality disorders are important in the etiology of chronic phantom pain nor that they are more prevalent among those amputees reporting phantom pain than among those not reporting it.\r"

These infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis and lung abscesses. The indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. These direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.\r"

These complications occur more often in association with chronic sinusitis and chronic otitis media. Because symptoms and signs of the intracranial complications can be nonspecific, a high index of suspicion by the physician is important for early diagnosis. The routine cerebrospinal fluid examination often does not distinguish between the various complications, and radiologic procedures such as radionuclide brain scan, arteriography and computer-assisted tomographic scan should be used. Computer-assisted tomographic scan is very useful in detecting early complications allowing trial with medical treatment alone. Appropriate selection of antibiotics must be made on the basis of the likely pathogens in the particular setting and the ability of the antibiotic to penetrate the affected area. Appropriate early management of suppurative intracranial complications should result in a favorable outcome.\r"

Parents in the intervention group received a three-part individualized course in child safety that required active parental participation. Parts 1, 2, and 3 were given at the 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month well-child visits, respectively. Parents in the control group received routine safety education as provided at well-child visits. The educational phase of the study was completed by 129 families, 65 in the intervention group and 64 in the control group. Safety knowledge, number of hazards in the home, and reported accidents were assessed by a \"blinded\" community health worker approximately 1 month after the 12-month well-child visit. A total of 109 home visits were made, 55 for the intervention group and 54 for the control group. Parental safety knowledge was assessed based upon pictorial hazard recognition. Of 13 possible hazards, the mean number of hazards recognized by the intervention group parents was 9.4 (n = 55) v 8.4 (n = 50) by the control group parents (t = 2.1, P less than .05, two-tailed). A hazard score was determined for each family based on nine possible hazards observed at the home visit. The mean hazard score for the intervention group was 2.4 (n = 55 v 3.0 (n = 54) for the control group (t = 2.4, P less than .02, two-tailed). Parentally reported accidents and accidents reported in hospital records were similar for both groups. Results of this study suggest that age-appropriate safety education that is repetitive and individualized and that requires active parental participation results in an increase in parental knowledge and an improvement in certain safety practices.\r"

The Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Sore Risk was described. Methods for measuring predictive validity and for calculating sensitivity, specificity, and per cent predictive value of positive and negative tests were discussed. Sixty consecutively admitted AICU patients who were pressure sore free were rated for pressure sore risk within 24 to 72 hours after admission. The skin condition of each patient was systematically assessed every 2 days. Twenty-four subjects developed pressure sores during the study period. The critical cut-off point at which the patient could be judged to be at risk for pressure sore formation was a Braden Scale score equal to or less than 16. The sensitivity and specificity of the scale at this score were 83 to 64 per cent, respectively. The per cent predictive value of a positive and negative test were 61 and 85 per cent, respectively. The Braden Scale compared favorably with the Norton Scale in respect to sensitivity. The specificity, or the tendency of a scale to overpredict, was greater for the Norton than for the Braden Scale. The Norton Scale overpredicted by 64 per cent, whereas the Braden Scale overpredicted by 36 per cent. This difference may be important clinically if all patients who were judged to be at risk received additional nursing care or protective devices. A greater number of patients may receive unnecessary and expensive treatments using the Norton Scale.\r"

Theoretically, second-generation agents are more advantageous than first-generation agents because they do not interact with other drugs. I do not believe that they are more efficacious, however, and they probably do not have fewer side effects if chlorpropamide (Diabinese) is eliminated from consideration. Future well-designed crossover studies may help to clarify this issue. Combined insulin and sulfonylurea therapy can be tried in obese patients resistant to large doses of insulin, although results are not dramatic. In all patients the goal is to reach acceptable fasting glucose levels and near-normal glycosylated hemoglobin values.\r"

Primary or metastatic cancer may also be the cause. Cervical metastasis often presents as a neck mass. Although a primary tumor may not be found immediately when a neck mass is being evaluated, one is often discovered later. Other types of malignancy that may be present are histiocytic lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, rhabdomyosarcoma, thyroid cancer, and a salivary (most often parotid) gland tumor. Symptomatic treatment is sometimes adequate for infectious disease, but administration of antituberculous drugs or antibiotics may also be necessary. Incision and drainage are required for some nodes and abscesses. For neck masses caused by neoplasms, fine-needle aspiration cytology or biopsy is performed. Depending on the diagnosis, treatment consists of dissection, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma of normal human individuals was shown to contain an inhibitor of Trypanosoma cruzi neuraminidase (NAase; acylneuraminyl hydrolase, sialidase, EC 3.2.1.18). The inhibitor has been purified to homogeneity by PEG precipitation, CM Affi-Gel Blue Sepharose chromatography, and gel filtration. The purified preparation inhibits T. cruzi NAase at a concentration as low as 10(-9) M and has no effect at concentrations at least 100 times higher on any of the other NAases tested, including those from influenza virus, the closely related trypanosome Trypanosoma rangeli, and mammalian NAases. The inhibitor is unique in that it prevents T. cruzi desialylation of intact mammalian cells but does not prevent desialylation of soluble glycoconjugates. In addition, the isolated material is effective in inhibiting the T. cruzi NAase whether the enzyme is on the parasite outer membrane or in solution. Molecular characterization indicates that the inhibitor is a glycoprotein with a Mr of 246,000 +/- 20,000 composed of subunits of Mr 28,000 +/- 2000. Its plasma concentration is at least 60 micrograms/ml. The mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, but it appears to be noncompetitive. Attempts to match the isolated NAase inhibitor with known plasma glycoproteins have not been successful. In view of this and of the specificity of the inhibitor for T. cruzi, we have named the inhibitor \"cruzin.\" This finding suggests a different approach in investigating the role that NAase plays in host-parasite interaction.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-dependent ATPase activity of recA protein. This activity is distinguished from the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-dependent ATPase activity by the presence of a pronounced lag time before the onset of steady-state ATP hydrolysis. During the lag phase there is little ATP hydrolysis. The duration of the lag phase, referred to as the lag time, is found to increase with the thermal stability of the dsDNA substrate. Increasing either the MgCl2 or NaCl concentration increases the lag time, whereas increasing the temperature decreases the lag time. The lag time shows little dependence on recA protein concentration but is strongly dependent on ATP concentration. After the lag phase, a steady-state ATP hydrolysis rate is achieved that approaches the rate observed with ssDNA. The steady-state phase of the reaction is proportional to the concentration of recA protein-DNA complex and shows saturation behavior at approximately equal to 5 +/- 1 base pairs per recA protein monomer. These results suggest that the lag phase represents a rate-limiting step in the dsDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis reaction that requires a structural transition in the dsDNA and that involves a ternary complex of ATP, recA protein, and DNA. We propose that this transition involves the transient denaturation of the dsDNA to form regions of ssDNA. Elsewhere we demonstrate that the dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity is proportional to the rate of recA protein-catalyzed branch migration. We suggest that this activity is responsible for a polar polymerization that drives the branch migration reaction.\r"

  ".W": "The insulin receptor possesses protein kinase activity, which may play a role in mediating insulin action. Recently, we have identified a glycoprotein (pp120) in rat liver plasma membranes that is phosphorylated by the solubilized insulin receptor in a cell-free system. We now report that insulin stimulates phosphorylation of pp120 in intact H-35 cells. H-35 cells were preloaded with [32P]orthophosphate to label the intracellular ATP pool. Insulin caused a 10-fold increase in the phosphorylation of its receptor and a 2-fold increase in phosphorylation of pp120 (P less than 0.001). The time course of insulin's stimulation of pp120 closely paralleled that of insulin receptor phosphorylation over the time period investigated (15-45 min). This effect had the specificity corresponding to the insulin receptor. Epidermal growth factor was inactive, and insulin-like growth factor I had approximately equal to 1% the potency of insulin in this regard. Insulin increased 32P incorporation into pp120 in a linkage that was stable to alkaline hydrolysis, as would be expected for tyrosine-specific phosphorylation. Direct phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed that insulin increased 32P incorporation into phosphotyrosine residues in pp120.\r"

  ".W": "The G domain of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), representing the N-terminal half of the factor according to its three-dimensional model traced at high resolution, has been isolated by genetic manipulation of tufA and purified to homogeneity. The G domain, whose primary structure shares homology with the eukaryotic protein p21, is capable of supporting the basic activities of the intact molecule (guanine nucleotide binding in 1:1 molar ratio and GTPase activity). However, it is no longer exposed to the allosteric mechanisms regulating EF-Tu. The G-domain complexes with GTP and GDP display similar K'd values in the microM range, in contrast to EF-Tu that binds GDP much more tightly than GTP. Its GTPase shows the characteristics of a slow turnover reaction (0.1 mmol X sec-1 X mol-1 of G domain), whose rate closely corresponds to the initial hydrolysis rate of EF-Tu X GTP in the absence of effectors and lies in the typical range of GTPase of the p21 protein. Of the EF-Tu ligands only the ribosome displays a clear effect enhancing the G-domain GTPase. Our results suggest that the middle and C-terminal domain play an essential role in regulating the activity of the N-terminal domain of the intact molecule as well as in the interactions of EF-Tu with aminoacylated tRNA, elongation factor Ts, and kirromycin. With the isolation of the G domain of EF-Tu, a model protein has been constructed for studying and comparing common characteristics of the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins.\r"

Translation of gene fusions between N-terminal parts of fdhF with lacZ depends on the availability of selenium in the medium when the hybrid gene contains the UGA codon; it is independent of the presence of selenium when an fdhF portion upstream of the UGA position is fused to lacZ. Transcription does not require the presence of selenium in either case. By localized mutagenesis, the UGA codon was converted into serine (UCA) and cysteine (UGC and UGU) codons. Each mutation relieved the selenium dependency of fdhF mRNA translation. Selenium incorporation was completely abolished in the case of the UCA insertion and was reduced to about 10% when the UGA was replaced by a cysteine codon. Insertion of UCA yielded an inactive fdhF gene product, while insertion of UGC and UGU resulted in polypeptides with lowered activities as components in the system formerly known as formate hydrogenlyase. Altogether the results indicate that the UGA codon at position 140 directs the cotranslational insertion of selenocysteine into the fdhF polypeptide chain.\r"

This brings the total number of tRNA genes that we have so far characterized in this organism to 14, 6 of which code for tRNAs that read the codons of family boxes. In each of these latter cases, we found only one gene per family box, and the gene sequence contains a thymidine in the position corresponding to the wobble nucleotide, with the exception of the arginine tRNA gene that has an adenosine in this position. Furthermore, all of the tRNA structures reported here have an unsubstituted uridine in the wobble position. These findings are similar to those reported for mitochondria, especially yeast mitochondria, that contain an arginine tRNA with the anticodon ACG. However, the resemblance is not complete since we have demonstrated the presence of two isoacceptor tRNAs for threonine having uridine and adenosine, respectively, in the wobble position. It is suggested that in the M. mycoides at least some of the family codon boxes are read by only one tRNA each, using an unconventional method without discrimination between the nucleotides in the third codon position.\r"

The induction was blocked by chloramphenicol. Increases of 3-fold or more were also seen with plumbagin, menadione, and phenazine methosulfate. H2O2 produced no more than a 2-fold increase in endonuclease IV activity. The following agents had no significant effect: streptonigrin, nitrofurantoin, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, gamma rays, 260-nm UV radiation, methyl methanesulfonate, mitomycin C, and ascorbate. Paraquat, plumbagin, menadione, and phenazine methosulfate are known to generate superoxide radical anions via redox cycling in vivo. A mutant lacking superoxide dismutase was unusually sensitive to induction by paraquat. In addition, endonuclease IV could be induced by merely growing the mutant in pure O2. The levels of endonuclease IV in uninduced or paraquat-treated cells were unaffected by mutations of oxyR, a H2O2-inducible gene that governs an oxidative-stress regulon. The results indicate that endonuclease IV is an inducible DNA-repair enzyme and that its induction can be mediated via the production of superoxide radicals.\r"

Direct analysis of lac transcripts was used to show that the DNA sequence alone does not provide the signal to end the repressor mRNA and to establish that of the proteins with specific binding sites on control region DNA only the lac repressor has a striking effect on the continuity of lacI gene transcription. RNAs with 3' ends in the control region sequence are major mRNA species produced from a repressor-bound template, reflecting as much as a 50-fold increase over their levels in the repressor's absence. Repressor binding to the operator thus has a dual function. In addition to blocking initiation of transcription from the lacZ promoter, repressor serves as a termination factor by setting the length of its own transcript and separating lacI and lacZYA into two distinct transcription units.\r"

The function of p21ras in these tumors and the distribution and role of p21ras in corresponding normal tissues are unclear. This immunohistochemical study examined the relationship between p21ras expression and malignant transformation, cellular differentiation, and proliferative activity in vivo. p21ras was found to be widely expressed in normal tissues, but within those tissues expression was often sharply restricted to cells at specific stages of differentiation; terminally differentiated cells generally showed stronger reactivity with antibodies to p21ras than did rapidly proliferating cells. Fetal and adult tissues had corresponding patterns of p21ras expression, and the distribution of p21ras in neoplasms paralleled the pattern in normal tissue from which they were derived. Thus, p21ras seems to play a role in many fully differentiated cell types, and levels of p21ras expression do not correlate with proliferative activity in normal cell or, in contrast to past reports, with the transformed phenotype.\r"

Luciferase is derived from the firefly (Photinus pyralis) and is synthesized and stored in the cells of the firefly's lantern organ, where it is also found in peroxisomes.

The 39-bp junction sequence is tandemly repeated in one of our clones. The association of tandemly repetitive sequences with Mst II elements or the putative superfamily is probably nonrandom; a search of DNA sequence data bases revealed that approximately 80 bp of the Mst II left arm occurs immediately adjacent to the tandem repeat that comprises the human homologue to the BK virus enhancer. The fortuitous occurrence of a gene duplication event involving an Mst II repeat has allowed us to estimate a mutation rate for human DNA.\r"

The amino acid sequences of APRTs have been highly conserved throughout evolution. The human enzyme is 82%, 90%, and 40% identical to the mouse, hamster, and Escherichia coli enzymes, respectively. The promoter region of the human APRT gene, like that of several other \"housekeeping\" genes, lacks \"TATA\" and \"CCAAT\" boxes but contains five GC boxes that are potential binding sites for the Sp1 transcription factor. The distal three, however, are dispensable for gene expression. Comparison between human and mouse APRT gene nucleotide sequences reveals a high degree of homology within protein coding regions but an absence of significant homology in 5' flanking, 3' untranslated, and intron sequences, except for similarly positioned GC boxes in the promoter region and a 26-base-pair region in intron 3. This 26-base-pair sequence is 92% identical with a similarly positioned sequence in the mouse gene and is also found in intron 3 of the hamster gene, suggesting that its retention may be a consequence of stringent selection. The positions of all introns have been precisely retained in the human and both rodent genes, as has an unusual AG/GC donor splice site in intron 2. Particularly striking is the distribution of CpG dinucleotides within human and rodent APRT genes. Although the nucleotide sequences of intron 1 and the 5' flanking regions of human and mouse APRT genes have no substantial homology, they have a frequency of CpG dinucleotides that is much higher than expected and nonrandom considering the G + C content of the gene. Retention of an elevated CpG dinucleotide content, despite loss of sequence homology, suggests that there may be selection for CpG dinucleotides in these regions and that their maintenance may be important for APRT gene function.\r"

The mouse cells carry the Escherichia coli xanthine (guanine) phosphoribosyltransferase (gpt) gene in a retroviral shuttle vector integrated into chromosomal DNA in a proviral form. Cells with spontaneous mutations in the gpt gene were selected as resistant to 6-thioguanine and then were fused with COS cells for recovery of the mutant genes. Out of a total of 77 independent 6-thioguanine-resistant cell lines isolated in this study, vector sequences could be rescued from 43 of the mutant lines, and the base sequences were determined for the gpt genes in all 43 of these lines. There was a variety of mutational events among the mutant gpt genes sequenced. The most frequent mutational event was a deletion (in 29 of the 43 mutant genes), and the next most frequent event was a base substitution mutation (in 11 of the 43 mutant genes). Among the deletion mutants, the great majority represent deletions of less than 10 base pairs. In fact, 19 of the 29 deletion mutants had deletions of 3 base pairs, and among the mutants with 3-base-pair deletions, there was a very strong deletion hot spot appearing in 16 independent mutants. All 19 of the 3-base-pair deletions resulted in the \"in frame\" loss of an aspartic acid codon. Among the base substitution mutations, transitions and transversions occurred with approximately equal frequency. Our results raise the possibility that small deletions represent the predominant mechanisms by which spontaneous mutations occur in mammalian cells.\r"

Mucus-secreting cells from remaining parts of the gastrointestinal tract and other mucus-secreting organs such as respiratory, genitourinary tracts, salivary and mammary glands did not show any reactivity to 7E6A5. These findings indicate that the antigen recognized by 7E6A5 is shared by the goblet cells of both the small and large intestines and is unique to them. The monoclonal antibody may be useful in the study of function of mucus-secreting goblet cells and may represent an important tool in the evaluation of diseases such as ulcerative colitis, colon cancer, and intestinal metaplasia in gastric mucosa that are associated with quantitative changes in goblet cell numbers or with qualitative differences in mucin secretion.\r"

Although blood glucose levels serve as the major stimulus of insulin secretion in mammals, insulin release is also modulated by amino acids, catecholamines, glucagon, and other, intestinal hormones. The identification of factors that modulate insulin production has engendered much interest because of their potential importance in the altered dynamics of insulin secretion in response to glucose characteristic of maturity-onset diabetes mellitus. Decoding of the glucagon gene has uncovered two additional glucagon-like peptides encoded in proglucagon, the polypeptide precursor of glucagon. One of these peptides, glucagon-like peptide I, is processed from proglucagon in two forms, of 31 and 37 amino acids. We report that the smaller of the two glucagon-like peptides potently increases cAMP levels, insulin mRNA transcripts, and insulin release in cultured rat insulinoma cells. These results indicate that glucagon-like peptide I may be a physiologic modulator of insulin gene expression.\r"

Unlike insulin, the antibodies failed to stimulate receptor autophosphorylation in both intact IM-9 lymphocytes and purified human placental insulin receptors. Moreover, unlike insulin, the antibodies failed to stimulate receptor-mediated phosphorylation of exogenous substrates. However, like insulin, two of the three antibodies stimulated glucose transport in isolated human adipocytes. One antibody, on a molar basis, was as potent as insulin. These studies indicate, therefore, that monoclonal antibodies to the insulin receptor can mimic a major function of insulin without activating receptor kinase activity. They also raise the possibility that certain actions of insulin such as stimulation of glucose transport may not require the activation of receptor kinase activity.\r"

A crude cell extract was partially dissociated into fimbriae and an adhesin-enriched fraction by heating to 70 degrees C. From the latter, adhesin was purified to apparent homogeneity (by fast protein liquid chromatography, immunoblot, and NaDodSO4/PAGE) by differential ammonium sulfate precipitation, dissociation in 8 M guanidine hydrochloride, and high-resolution anion-exchange chromatography in 8 M urea. The purified adhesin formed an aggregate of Mr approximately 10(6) that was made up of one type of 12-kDa polypeptide (fimbrillin is 16.5 kDa). It had pI value of 4.7 (fimbriae has a pI value of 6). Adhesin and fimbrillin had different amino acid compositions. The purified adhesins agglutinated human and bovine erythrocytes with the same specificity as the whole bacteria; purified fimbriae were not adhesive. Monoclonal anti-adhesin and anti-fimbriae antibodies were obtained. Monoclonal anti-adhesin, but none of the anti-fimbriae, antibodies inhibited the agglutination of erythrocytes. The anti-adhesive antibodies were used in immuno-gold electron microscopy to localize adhesin exclusively on the fimbriae, with a possible preference to their tips.\r"

Immunoblot analysis of purified human epidermal keratin and hamster brain homogenate confirms the reactivity of this antibody to epidermal keratin polypeptides. All the major epidermal keratins were recognized by this antibody. It did not bind to the remaining major intermediate filament proteins. These findings suggest that monoclonal antibody 34C9 recognizes a cytoskeletal structure connected with intermediate filaments.

We report here that NPY-immunoreactive neurons are also abundant in three cranial parasympathetic ganglia, the otic, sphenopalatine, and ciliary, in the rat. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of the immunoreactive material present in the otic ganglion indicates that this material is very similar to porcine NPY and indistinguishable from the NPY-like immunoreactivity present in rat sympathetic neurons. These findings raise the possibility that NPY acts as a neuromodulator in the parasympathetic as well as the sympathetic nervous system. In contrast to what has been observed for sympathetic neurons, NPY-immunoreactive neurons in cranial parasympathetic ganglia do not contain detectable catecholamines or tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.2) immunoreactivity, and many do contain immunoreactivity for vasoactive intestinal peptide and/or choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6). These findings suggest that there is no simple rule governing coexpression of NPY with norepinephrine, acetylcholine, or vasoactive intestinal peptide in autonomic neurons. Further, while functional studies have indicated that NPY exerts actions on the peripheral vasculature which are antagonistic to those of acetylcholine and vasoactive intestinal peptide, the present results raise the possibility that these three substances may have complementary effects on other target tissues.\r"

  ".U": "87204188\r", 
  ".W": "Expression of a transforming Harvey or Kirsten ras gene caused opposing effects in the ability of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and bradykinin to activate phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. In [3H]inositol-labeled rat-1 fibroblasts, PDGF (5 ng/ml) resulted in a 2-fold increase in the level of [3H]inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) after 2 min and, in the presence of LiCl, a 3- to 8-fold increase in the level of [3H]inositol monophosphate (InsP1) after 30 min. However, in EJ-ras-transfected rat-1 cells, which exhibit near normal levels of PDGF receptors, PDGF resulted in little or no accumulation of either [3H]InsP3 or [3H]InsP1. Similarly, marked stimulations by PDGF were observed in NIH 3T3 cells, as well as in v-src-transformed 3T3 cells, but not in 3T3 cells transformed by Kirsten sarcoma virus or by transfection with v-Ha-ras DNA. This diminished phosphoinositide response in ras-transformed cells was associated with a markedly attenuated mitogenic response to PDGF. On the other hand, both phosphoinositide metabolism and DNA synthesis in ras-transformed fibroblasts were stimulated several-fold by serum. In NIH 3T3 cells carrying a glucocorticoid-inducible v-Ha-ras gene, a close correlation was found between the expression of p21ras and the loss of PDGF-stimulated [3H]InsP1 accumulation. In contrast to this ras-induced desensitization to PDGF, ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells exhibited an enhanced sensitivity to bradykinin; this effect was associated with an elevated level of high-affinity [3H]bradykinin binding. We propose that a ras gene product (p21) can, directly or indirectly, influence growth factor-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, as well as DNA synthesis, via alterations in the properties of specific growth factor receptors.\r"

A phosphatidylinositol-glycan-specific phospholipase C that catalyzed this reaction was found in the plasma-membrane fraction of rat liver. The enzymatic activity was measured by the release of diacylglycerol from the glycosylated-phosphatidylinositol-membrane-anchored variant surface glycoproteins of African trypanosomes. The enzyme also catalyzed the production of an inositol phosphate-glycan from an insulin-sensitive phosphatidylinositol-glycan precursor. The enzyme was solubilized with neutral nonionic detergent and purified to near homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, followed by hydrophobic chromatography on butyl-agarose. The resulting enzyme preparation was purified approximately 20,000-fold from whole liver and exhibited one major silver-stained band of Mr 52,000 on NaDodSO4/PAGE. Gel permeation chromatography of the purified activity revealed a Stokes radius of 35 A and an apparent molecular weight of 62,000, suggesting that the enzyme was tightly associated with lipid or detergent but existed as a monomer in its active form. The enzyme was specific for glycosylated phosphatidylinositol; no hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, or phosphatidylcholine was observed. The enzyme was calcium independent and thiol activated. These data suggest a role for the phosphatidylinositol-glycan-specific phospholipase C as an effector for some of the metabolic actions of insulin.\r"

This increase of pHi in the tumorigenic CHEF cells is not due to autocrine growth factor production or to the persistent activation of pathways previously shown to modulate Na+/H+-antiporter activity present in the CHEF/18 line. These findings suggest that the defect in pHi regulation in the tumorigenic CHEF/18 derivatives lies in the Na+/H+ antiporter itself. Further studies to determine the biological significance of an increased pHi show that the external pH (pHo)-dependence curve for initiation of DNA synthesis in the tumorigenic CHEF lines is shifted by approximately 0.2 pH unit toward acidic values relative to that of the nontumorigenic CHEF/18 parent. These data show a critical role for pHi in the regulation of DNA synthesis in Chinese hamster embryo fibroblasts and demonstrate that aberrations in pHi can contribute to the acquisition of altered growth properties.\r"

  ".W": "The structure of the gene for protein C, an anticoagulant serine protease, was analyzed in 29 unrelated patients with hereditary thrombophilia and protein C deficiency. Gene deletion(s) or gross rearrangement(s) was not demonstrable by Southern blot hybridization to cDNA probes. However, two unrelated patients showed a variant restriction pattern after Pvu II or BamHI digestion, due to mutations in the last exon: analysis of their pedigrees, including three or seven heterozygotes, respectively, with approximately 50% reduction of both enzymatic and antigen level, showed the abnormal restriction pattern in all heterozygous individuals, but not in normal relatives. Cloning of protein C gene and sequencing of the last exon allowed us to identify a nonsense and a missense mutation, respectively. In the first case, codon 306 (CGA, arginine) is mutated to an inframe stop codon, thus generating a new Pvu II recognition site. In the second case, a missense mutation in the BamHI palindrome (GGATCC----GCATCC) leads to substitution of a key amino acid (a tryptophan to cysteine substitution at position 402), invariantly conserved in eukaryotic serine proteases. These point mutations may explain the protein C-deficiency phenotype of heterozygotes in the two pedigrees.\r"

  ".W": "Seven mutations that yield thermolabile DNA polymerases have been isolated in the DNA polymerase I gene, POL1, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Strains carrying the mutant genes are temperature sensitive for growth. The pol1 mutants were identified by a method that has general applicability for identification of both temperature-sensitive and null mutations. A plasmid containing a mutagenized pol1 gene was transformed into a strain in which the only functional copy of the POL1 gene was carried on an unstable plasmid. The genes conferring temperature-sensitive growth were detected after elimination of the unstable plasmid containing the wild-type gene. DNA polymerase I isolated from each of the mutants is defective at both 23 degrees C and 36 degrees C. DNA synthesis is deficient in vivo at 36 degrees C in all the mutants, while RNA synthesis is normal in all but one of the mutants. The terminal phenotype of pol1 temperature-sensitive mutants is dumbbell-shaped cells in which the nucleus has migrated to, but apparently not entered, the isthmus separating the mother and the daughter. The POL1 gene is located on chromosome XIV approximately 2 centimorgans away from met4.\r"

  ".W": "GCN4 encodes a transcriptional activator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is regulated at the translational level. We show that an approximately 240-nucleotide segment from the GCN4 mRNA leader containing four AUG codons is sufficient to confer translational control typical of GCN4 upon a GAL1-lacZ fusion transcript. Regulation of the hybrid transcript is dependent upon multiple positive (GCN) and negative (GCD) trans-acting factors shown to regulate GCN4 expression post-transcriptionally. This result limits the target sequences for these factors to a small internal segment of the GCN4 mRNA leader. The elimination of AUG codons within this segment substantially reduces the usual derepressing effect of mutations in five GCD genes upon GCN4-lacZ expression. This supports the idea that the products of these negative regulatory genes act by modulating the effects of the upstream AUG codons on translation of GCN4 mRNA.\r"

When MNNG-adapted xthA- bacteria are challenged with a high dose of MNNG, more xthA(-)-dependent SOS-dependent mutations are induced, and transversions are enhanced relative to transitions. The mutations induced by challenge are eliminated in xthA- alkA- bacteria, which are also deficient for 3-methyladenine glycosylase II activity. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that AP sites, at least some of which are produced by glycosylase activity, are mutagenic intermediates following cellular DNA alkylation.\r"

All four monoclonal antibodies reacted in immunohistochemistry with structures present on parathyroid epithelial cells and proximal-tubule cells of the kidney but were unreactive with all other human tissues investigated. Immunofluorescence microscopy on suspended human parathyroid cells showed that the antibodies reacted with structures present on the cell surface. Two of these antibodies efficiently blocked the increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration of parathyroid cells that is normally associated with increased concentrations of extracellular calcium. The results indicate that these two antibodies interfere with a calcium-sensing mechanism of parathyroid cells--i.e., a potential calcium receptor by which extracellular calcium regulates cytoplasmic calcium and hormone release in these cells.\r"
