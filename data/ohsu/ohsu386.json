Because of the superb exposure it offers, its wide clinical application, and its overall safety, the thoracoabdominal incision should continue to be a viable surgical option in current thoracic surgical practice.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have indicated that some hypertensive patients, following a period of effective treatment with certain antihypertensive drugs, may experience prolonged normotension after drug withdrawal. We have studied the ability of carteolol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, to produce such remissions of hypertension. Thirty-four patients whose diastolic blood pressure was controlled at 90 mm Hg or less with carteolol monotherapy (2.5 to 5.0 mg/d for an average of 328 days) were randomized to a nine-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled drug-withdrawal trial. Those patients randomized to continue carteolol therapy had initially responded to carteolol treatment with reduction in blood pressure from 151 +/- 4/99 +/- 2 to 132 +/- 4/80 +/- 2 mm Hg. Those randomized to treatment with placebo had initially responded with blood pressure reductions from 154 +/- 4/97 +/- 2 to 137 +/- 4/81 +/- 2 mm Hg. Changes in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg +/- SEM) from baseline during carteolol therapy to the final visit at nine months were not different for patients receiving placebo (13 +/- 5/6 +/- 4 mm Hg, recumbent; 11 +/- 6/4 mm Hg, standing) or carteolol (11 +/- 5/7 +/- 3 mm Hg, recumbent; 12 +/- 6/7 +/- 3 mm Hg, standing). The final mean recumbent diastolic blood pressure (86.9 mm Hg) was the same in both groups. Prolonged normotension may follow a period of carteolol treatment, again suggesting the potential importance of periodic withdrawal of antihypertensive medication.\r"

Furthermore, combination therapy with sulfonylurea and insulin is effective in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. Therefore, to assess the efficacy of this type of combination therapy in type I diabetes, we conducted a double-blind clinical trial with tolazamide and insulin in 15 subjects with type I diabetes. The diagnosis of type I diabetes was confirmed by previous episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis and undetectable C-peptide levels in serum samples from blood drawn from patients two hours after breakfast. During the study protocol, placebo or tolazamide was randomly added to insulin and the combination therapy was continued for three months. In the placebo group, levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) did not alter significantly at the end of the study period. However, in the tolazamide group, levels of FPG and HbA1c markedly improved after administration of tolazamide (FPG levels before therapy, 10.8 +/- 0.9 mmol/L [mean +/- SEM]; after therapy, 6.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/L; HbA1c levels before therapy, 10.9% +/- 0.6%; after therapy, 9.6% +/- 0.5%). Therefore, adjuvant therapy with tolazamide and insulin may be beneficial in achieving adequate metabolic control in type I diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an important cause of preventable death in older persons. Persistently high rupture mortality rates indicate that these deaths can be prevented only by early detection and treatment of AAA. In an effort to develop an effective and efficient program of AAA detection, we selectively screened a high-risk population. Men aged 60 to 75 years with hypertension and/or coronary artery disease were randomly selected from a general medicine clinic and screened with physical examination and ultrasound. Eighteen previously unsuspected aneurysms, 3.6 to 5.9 cm in size (mean, 4.4 cm), were detected in 201 patients, for a prevalence of 9% (95% confidence interval: 4.7% to 13.3%). The specificity and positive predictive value of ultrasound were each 100%. Abdominal palpation detected only half of these aneurysms, but missed none in patients with an abdominal girth less than 100 cm (n = 6). This degree of sensitivity did not occur with \"routine\" examinations and requires that the examination be directed specifically toward AAA detection. We conclude that undiagnosed AAAs are common in this large subgroup of the clinic population, that ultrasound is an excellent screening test for AAAs, and that physical examination may be adequate for screening thin patients. We recommend that every two or three years persons over the age of 50 years undergo careful abdominal palpation aimed at detecting AAAs, as part of the periodic health examination. We further recommend that obese older men at high risk for AAA have at least one-time screening with abdominal ultrasound, regardless of findings on physical examination.\r"

Thromboembolism related to atrial fibrillation without valvular heart disease was the probable source of cerebral ischemia in 25 (80%) of 31 patients with stroke and coexisting atherosclerotic disease at the carotid artery bifurcation in six (20%). Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation was the probable source of symptoms in nine (70%) of 13 of patients with transient cerebral ischemia, while coexisting carotid artery disease was present in four (30%). Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation accounted for the symptoms in four of five patients with amaurosis fugax, with atherosclerotic carotid artery disease present in one. The remaining 24 patients had nonhemispheric symptoms of cerebrovascular disease, including vertebrobasilar insufficiency, dizziness, and syncope, and only one had a carotid lesion. A significantly higher proportion of patients with focal hemispheric symptoms had coexisting carotid disease than patients with nonfocal symptoms had, suggesting that atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease contributes to stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Noninvasive carotid artery testing may be helpful in identifying atherosclerotic lesions at the carotid artery bifurcation in patients with atrial fibrillation and cerebrovascular disease, because different therapeutic modalities may be appropriate when two potential sources of cerebral ischemia are present.\r"

  ".W": "Serum concentrations of magnesium, potassium, calcium, and sodium were determined on admission of 224 patients to the hospital and after 2, 4, and 6 days in hospital; all were admitted to the hospital with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI). On admission, the patients were randomly allocated to 48 hours of treatment with magnesium intravenously or placebo. One hundred twenty-three patients had AMI (of whom 53 [43%] were treated with magnesium) and 101 had their suspected AMI disproven (of whom 51 [50%] were treated with magnesium). In a supplementary study, serum and urine levels of magnesium, potassium, calcium, and sodium, together with serum levels of parathyroid hormone, were determined before and after intravenous magnesium treatment in six patients with AMI and six patients with ischemic heart disease but without AMI. In both studies, magnesium therapy was associated with significant alterations in extracellular ion homeostasis. Serum concentrations of potassium decreased during the initial days of hospitalization in the patients treated with placebo, but increased slightly in the patients treated with magnesium infusions. These increments in the serum concentrations of magnesium and potassium correlated significantly. The increase in the serum concentration of potassium after magnesium infusions was due to a reduced renal potassium excretion level (from 71.3 to 49.4 mmol/24 h), indicating the existence of a divalent-monovalent cation exchange mechanism in the nephron. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that renal sodium excretion likewise decreased after magnesium infusions (from 83.2 to 59.2 mmol/24 h). Serum concentration of calcium decreased significantly after magnesium treatment (from 2.35 mmol/L on admission to 2.15 mmol/L after 24 hours in the hospital) in the AMI group, in contrast to the placebo-treated patients, where no significant fluctuations in serum concentration of calcium were detected during the initial six days. This decrease in serum concentration of calcium was due to a marked increase in renal calcium excretion (from 3.43 mmol/24 h before to 6.59 mmol/24 h after magnesium infusion). A correlation between increments in serum magnesium concentration and decrements in serum calcium concentration was detected. No change in serum levels of parathyroid hormone was found before and after magnesium infusions. Both serum and urine levels of magnesium significantly increased after magnesium treatment to levels above the upper normal limits (serum magnesium concentration increased from 0.81 to 1.21 mmol/L, urine magnesium excretion levels from 3.57 to 16.57 mmol/24 h for both serum and urine changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The role of organized medicine and science in events leading to passage of federal legislation is discussed. Past efforts of the American Medical Association and the American physician have been critical in numerous successful efforts at the local, state, and national level to prevent the passage of laws which restricted animal use for health research and impeded medical progress. This article demonstrates that current initiatives by physicians to preserve biomedical research are a reaffirmation of their traditional role.\r"

We administered three concentrations of apraclonidine (0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%) and vehicle alone bilaterally every 12 hours for one week. Patients were examined 2, 5, and 8 hours after the initial dose, and then on day 2 and day 8. We studied IOP, pupillary diameter, interpalpebral fissure width, blood pressure, and pulse. There was a two-week washout period after each one-week session. All concentrations of apraclonidine significantly lowered IOP. The 0.5% and 0.25% concentrations had equal maximal effects, lowering IOP in each patient by an average of 27% relative to vehicle alone. This corresponded to a mean decrease in IOP of 8.7 mm Hg, from a baseline of 24.9 mm Hg to 16.2 mm Hg. The 0.5% and 0.25% concentrations were significantly more effective than the 0.125% concentration at two and eight hours. Mean interpalpebral fissure width increased in a dose-dependent fashion; the pupillary effect was minimal. Blood pressure and pulse were unchanged. Thirty percent of subjects reported transient dry nose or dry mouth. These symptoms may be dose-dependent.\r"

Previous studies have shown that VIP-like immunoreactive nerves are present in the uveal tissues of the human eye. The distribution of VIP-like immunoreactivity of the human lacrimal gland and sphenopalatine ganglion was studied. A lacy network of VIP-like immunoreactive nerve fibers was found in the lacrimal gland and was predominantly located along the basilar surface of the acinar epithelium and in the interstitial connective tissue of the gland. This pattern of innervation was nearly identical to the distribution of cholinesterase-positive fibers in human lacrimal glands. The VIP-like immunoreactive cell bodies were found throughout the sphenopalatine ganglion obtained at autopsy. The distribution of VIP-like immunoreactive nerves in the human lacrimal gland and sphenopalatine ganglion was generally similar to that described in mammalian and avian systems, although some differences were noted. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide may represent an important cotransmitter or neuromodulator for the facial parasympathetic nerves that supply the eye and the lacrimal gland.\r"

In spite of a comparable fall in blood pressure, the effects of the two drugs on forearm hemodynamics were quite different. Enalapril induced a fall in vascular resistance and an increase in brachial artery diameter, flow, and compliance, while atenolol failed to modify all these parameters. In the enalapril group the improvement in forearm vascular resistance and brachial artery compliance persisted after the 2-week washout period.

Prospectively, the study compared the extent to which systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) pressure during long-term converting-enzyme inhibition (CEI) and the ipsi- to contralateral renal vein renin ratio (RVR) predicted success of PTRA, defined as SBP less than 160 mmHg and DBP less than 95 mmHg. Both SBP and DBP after PTRA were positively correlated with pressure during CEI (P less than 0.001) and negatively with RVR (P less than 0.03). In multiple regression these associations were independent and remained statistically significant. In discriminant analysis, a SBP during CEI less than 160 mmHg, a DBP during CEI less than 95 mmHg, and a RVR greater than or equal to 1.5 identified with equal accuracy the success of PTRA. Furthermore, in patients with a SBP during CEI less than 160 mmHg, the demonstration of a RVR greater than or equal to 1.5 increased (P less than 0.05) the prediction of a positive outcome from 50 to 67%. In contrast, in 92% of the patients with a SBP during CEI greater than 160 mmHg, PTRA was not successful. Thus, blood pressure measurements during long-term CEI predict the curability by PTRA of renovascular hypertension and can be employed either alone or in association with the RVR.\r"

This examination should be performed on days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 after onset of paralysis. If the percentage of surviving axons falls below 10% within the first 14 days, an incomplete recovery is suggested. Electromyography may assist in prognosticating a functional return, determining neural conduction across the site of injury and following reinervation in the recovery period. The persistence or early return of an absent R1 component of the blink reflex may qualitatively suggest a satisfactory functional outcome in facial paralysis. Supramaximally exciting the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen and comparing the clinical response on the affected and nonaffected side, maximum stimulation test, can also predict eventual seventh nerve return. Observing a minimal twitch, utilizing the nerve excitability test or measuring the facial nerve latency have yielded poor correlations with functional return and are of limited usefulness in the prognostication of acute facial palsies. Trigeminal somatosensory evoked potentials can be employed to evaluate the status of the trigeminal nerve as approximately 50% of patients with Bell's palsy also have lesions involving the fifth nerve. Side-to-side amplitude comparison and electromyography are the two most valuable electrophysiologic methods of assessing facial nerve functioning.\r"

Forty eight patients completed the study; 16 of the 21 dithranol only patients cleared in a mean of 19.5 days compared with 20 of the 27 dithranol + UVB patients who cleared in a mean of 20.3 days. These differences were not significant. Similarly there was no significant difference in response between the dithranol only and dithranol UVB group as measured by the change in plaque thickness measured using Harpenden calipers, and the severity of psoriasis assessed by the extent of the rash, the degree of scaling, redness and induration. Thirteen of the 16 dithranol only patients who cleared relapsed in a mean of 10.6 weeks compared with 14 of the 20 dithranol UVB patients who relapsed after a mean of 18.9 weeks (P less than 0.05). Comparison of pre- and post-treatment full blood count, biochemical screen and urinalysis showed no evidence of systemic toxicity due to SCDT. This study shows that UVB therapy does not improve the clearance of psoriasis in SCDT, but does significantly postpone relapse.\r"

The overall preterm delivery rate was 30%. The results for those allocated cerclage were marginally statistically significant, more favourable in terms of fewer deliveries before 33 weeks [59 (13%) compared with 82 (18%), P = 0.03] and correspondingly for birthweight under 1500 g [48 (11%) compared with 73 (16%), P = 0.01] and for miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death [37 (8%) compared with 54 (12%), P = 0.06]. There were similar numbers of deliveries between 33 and 36 weeks [65 (14%) compared with 64 (14%)]. These results suggest that the operation had an important beneficial effect in one in 20 to 25 cases in the trial. But because the observed differences are not strongly statistically significant and because no such benefit has been seen in other randomized trials, there remains uncertainty about how much (if any) of this apparent benefit is real. So, the trial still remains open for randomization of more women whose obstetricians are uncertain about the advisability of cerclage.\r"

  ".W": "Markedly elevated serum IgE levels have been noted following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and have been correlated with graft-v-host disease (GVHD) in several studies. To investigate this phenomenon, we measured serum IgE levels in 387 allogeneic, 143 autologous, and 21 syngeneic BMT recipients before and at intervals after BMT. As a population, allogeneic BMT recipients displayed a biphasic elevation in IgE levels, with peak levels occurring either early (days 15 to 19) or late (days 80 to 89) posttransplant. Only in individuals in whom peak levels occurred early did IgE level correlate with liver disease, histological changes, and overall clinical stage of GVHD. The association of IgE elevation and GVHD does not appear to be direct since recipients of syngeneic (monozygotic twin) grafts had the highest incidence of IgE hyperresponsiveness as well as the highest absolute IgE levels. Similarly, 22 recipients of autologous marrow not treated with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide had elevated IgE levels comparable to those seen in allogeneic graft recipients. We hypothesize that augmented IgE synthesis and its subsequent resolution is the natural consequence of immune reconstitution in the presence of potentially reaginic agents such as antibiotics and infectious agents. As such, IgE hyperresponsiveness in syngeneic graft recipients may reflect the maturational sequence of IgE regulatory elements in the absence of interference by GVHD, GVHD therapy, or minor histocompatibility disparities. The cell populations required for IgE response (T cells, B cells, and antigen-presenting cells) may be reconstituted in advance of the regulatory elements that limit IgE production in healthy subjects. Although this temporal relationship does not appear to hold in allogeneic BMT, the balance between positive and negative factors, which determines the rates of IgE synthesis and catabolism, may be altered by GVHD, infection, and liver dysfunction acting alone or in combination.\r"

Renal biopsies were performed in two patients at the onset of kidney disease and showed mesangiolysis with intraglomerular capillary aneurysm formation, mesangial proliferation, and focal thickening and splitting of the glomerular basement membranes. The clinical presentation, time to onset of renal disease, and biopsy material are consistent with a diagnosis of radiation nephritis, a previously uncommon finding in this patient group.

Recently isolated peripheral blood monocytes that contain no demonstrable tissue factor activity can be induced to express tissue factor activity by a number of stimulatory agents. Monocyte-associated tissue factor activity transiently increases in response to adherence to tissue culture plates and, consistent with other reports, markedly increases after the isolated monocytes are treated with endotoxin. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induced an increase in tissue factor activity at low doses (10(-11) to 10(-12) mol/L). Conversely, concentrations of PMA that stimulate release of oxygen metabolites or that cause the cytosol-to-membrane translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L) resulted in a rapid decrease in both adherence-induced and endotoxin-induced monocyte tissue factor activity. The effects of PMA on monocytes were time- and dose-dependent with respect to PKC translocation, release of oxygen metabolites, and changes in tissue factor activity. Immunofluorescent staining of monocytes with monoclonal antibody (MoAb) HTF1-7B8, directed against human tissue factor, revealed that tissue factor antigen was induced concurrently with tissue factor activity by adherence and endotoxin and that tissue factor antigen decreased after PMA stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "We review 15 cases of secondary B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders that occurred among 2,475 patients who received allogeneic bone marrow transplants (BMTs) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle) between 1969 and 1987. The histopathologic findings in 14 of the 15 patients spanned a wide spectrum of lymphoproliferative lesions. One patient had features characteristic of angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomic sequences were identified by Southern blot analysis in each of the 13 patients evaluated. Ten of the 12 lesions evaluated originated in donor cells. In two patients, who had mixed chimerism after transplantation, the lesions originated in host cells. The combined evidence from immunoglobulin light chain staining and the analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement indicated that the lesions in most patients represented polyclonal proliferations that gave rise to clonal subpopulations. The results indicate an overall actuarial incidence of 0.6% for this complication in BMT recipients. Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) treatment of acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) and T cell depletion of the donor marrow were statistically significant risk factors, and GVHD appeared to play a contributing role, particularly in the setting of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity. Two patients had no identifiable risk factors. Prophylaxis or treatment with acyclovir had no detectable effect in the patients; all but two died with uncontrolled lymphoproliferation.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind comparison of prednisone and placebo (group I) v prednisone and azathioprine (1.5 mg/kg/day) (group II) as early treatment of extensive chronic graft-v-host disease (GVHD). Patients with platelet counts less than 100,000/microL were placed into therapy with prednisone alone (group III). All three groups received identical doses of prednisone (1 mg/kg every other day) and one double-strength trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) tablet twice daily. Between January 1980 and December 1983, 179 previously untreated patients were enrolled and 164 were evaluable. Patients randomized to group I (n = 63) and group II (n = 63) were well matched for prognostic factors; those placed into group III (n = 38) had more frequent acute GVHD and progressive onset of chronic GVHD. Median duration of therapy was 2 years. Complications included diabetes (5%), aseptic necrosis (5%) and infection. For groups I, II, and III, the respective incidence of infection was disseminated varicella, 11%, 24%, 34%; bacteremia, 6%, 11%, 34%; and interstitial pneumonia, 5%, 14%, 18%. Recurrent malignancy was the most frequent cause of death and did not differ significantly across the groups. Nonrelapse mortality, however, did differ: 21% in group I, 40% in group II, and 58% in group III (I v II, P = .003; I v III, P = .001). Forty patients in group I, 30 in group II, and 10 in group III survive with a minimum follow-up of 3.8 years. Karnofsky performance scores for 68 survivors are 90% to 100%, scores for seven survivors are 70% to 89% and scores for five survivors are less than 70%. Actuarial survival at 5 years after transplant is 61% in group I, 47% in group II, and 26% in group III (I v II, P = .03; I v III, P = .0001). Treatment with prednisone alone results in fewer infections and better survival than prednisone and azathioprine in standard-risk chronic GVHD. Treatment with prednisone alone is less effective in high-risk patients with thrombocytopenia, and other strategies are required.\r"

Survival at 5 years after marrow transplant is only 26% in such patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and every other day with prednisone. Since October 1982, 61 patients with high-risk extensive chronic GVHD were treated with a new alternating-day regimen of prednisone (1 mg/kg every other day) and oral cyclosporine (6 mg/kg every 12 hours every other day) with one double-strength TMP-SMX tablet twice daily. Forty patients (group I) received primary treatment of thrombocytopenic chronic GVHD (median platelet count 35 [range 7 to 87] x 10(3)/microL). Twenty-one patients (group II) received salvage treatment after failing initial prednisone +/- azathioprine. Twenty-one patients in group I and 15 in group II survive with a minimum of 2 years and a median of 3.7 years follow-up. At 4 years after transplant, actuarial survival is 51% (group I) and 67% (group II). Causes of death included interstitial pneumonia (six), relapse (five), GVHD without infection (five), infection (four), organ failure (three), and hemorrhage (two). Mortality increased with the progressive type onset of chronic GVHD and treatment failure. Toxicity included hypertension (13), nephrotoxicity (nine), nausea (seven), aseptic necrosis (five), neurologic abnormalities (four), and diabetes (three). Median cyclosporine levels at four and 36 hours were 296 and 64 ng/mL, respectively. Four patients required permanent discontinuation of cyclosporine, but none required renal dialysis. Karnofsky performance scores for 25 survivors are 90% to 100%, scores for six survivors are 70% to 89%, and scores for five survivors are less than 70%. Alternating-day cyclosporine and prednisone has acceptable toxicity and appears to improve survival in patients with high-risk chronic GVHD.\r"

GM-CSF has a stimulatory effect on a number of neutrophil functions, but the effect on macrophage function is less clear. We investigated the effect of purified murine recombinant GM-CSF on murine peritoneal macrophage oxidative metabolism, Fc-dependent phagocytosis, anti-Toxoplasma activity, and expression of class II major histocompatibility antigen (Iad). GM-CSF significantly increased phorbol myristate acetate- and zymosan-elicited H2O2 release by resident and thioglycollate-elicited macrophages after 48 hours in vitro. The effect of recombinant GM-CSF was blocked by polyclonal anti-GM-CSF antibody and was not altered by lipopolysaccharide (0.01 to 1.0 microgram/mL). GM-CSF also stimulated Fc-dependent phagocytosis by peritoneal macrophages, although the stimulation of resident macrophages (1.4-fold) was less dramatic than that of thioglycollate-elicited cells (2.1-fold). GM-CSF (at doses up to 100 U/mL) had no effect on macrophage anti-Toxoplasma activity or on expression of Iad. In addition to stimulating macrophage growth, GM-CSF selectively promotes the functional capacity of tissue-derived macrophages.\r"

Seven patients had BrOb. All seven died, and BrOb was a contributing cause of death in six patients. Only recipients of allogeneic BMT were at risk for developing BrOb (2% incidence). Three cases were incidentally discovered at autopsy in patients who died less than 120 days after BMT from ventilatory failure owing to interstitial pneumonitis. Four cases were patients who died greater than 120 days after BMT. Of this latter group, all had overt chronic graft-v-host disease (CGVHD). Among 120 day survivors of allogeneic BMT, 6% of those with CGVHD developed BrOb as compared with none of those without CGVHD (P = .008). Five percent of patients with reduced IgG levels at day 120 developed BrOb as compared with none of those with normal IgG (P = .04). The incidence of BrOb in 120-day survivors was 14% (4 of 29) in patients with both CGVHD and decreased serum IgG, whereas patients with CGVHD only (0 of 25), those with decreased IgG levels only (0 of 53), and those with no CGVHD and normal IgG levels (0 of 70) did not develop BrOb.\r"

The B-enriched fractions of peripheral blood from ten normal subjects and 22 autografted patients (11 patients after ABMT, eight patients after ABSCT, and three patients after ABSCT followed by ABMT) were investigated. Time postgrafting ranged from 1 to 34 months. Proliferative responses to anti-mu antibody, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 (SAC), and low molecular weight (mol wt) 12-Kd B-cell growth factor (BCGF) were measured. Differentiative responses to the same factors were assessed by quantifying in vitro immunoglobulin (IgG/IgM) production. The authors found no difference in B-cell function between the ABMT and the ABSCT patient groups. Compared to the B cells of normal subjects, only five out of 22 autografted patients showed a normal proliferative response to all agents used, while nine out of 22 did not respond to any signals. Eight out of 22 patients displayed various defects of B-cell response. However, in vitro IgG/IgM secretion of predominantly IgG subclass was normal in 19 out of 22 patients. This in vitro ability to produce Ig was reflected by the patients' normal serum IgG/IgM levels, whereas serum IgA levels were low. The authors speculate that there may be 2 B-cell populations: the normal in vitro Ig production and in vivo serum IgG may come from the stimulation of a small number of re-infused pre-committed memory B cells while, in parallel, immature B cells develop from autografted hematopoietic progenitor cells.\r"

  ".U": "88294330\r", 
  ".W": "The CD11b (Mol) molecule is a member of a family of surface glycoproteins that are essential for adhesion-dependent granulocyte functions. Brief exposure of granulocytes to human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in vitro increases the surface expression of CD11b and increases granulocyte adhesiveness. To assess the possible in vivo significance of these observations we studied the effect of GM-CSF on CD11b, CD11a (LFA-1), and CD11c (gp 150, 95) expression on granulocytes from nine adult patients with sarcoma who were receiving GM-CSF as part of a phase I trial. GM-CSF was administered as a continuous infusion at a dose of 32 or 64 micrograms/kg/d. Granulocyte CD11b, CD11a, and CD11c expression was determined by indirect immunofluorescence staining of whole blood, thereby minimizing in vitro manipulation. A transient leukopenia developed within 15 minutes of initiation of GM-CSF treatment that was associated with a marked increase in the surface antigen density of CD11b. A mean 1.7-fold increase (P = .001) in the percentage of CD11b-positive granulocytes and a mean 2.1-fold increase (P = .002) in CD11b surface antigen density was noted after 12 hours of treatment. No change in CD11a or CD11c expression was observed over the first 12 hours. The level of CD11b expression was followed in six patients for up to 5 days of treatment with GM-CSF. Compared with the 12-hour value, three of six patients showed a subsequent decrease in CD11b expression, two remained constant, and one showed a continued increase in CD11b surface density. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of granulocytes into high- and low-density CD11b-positive groups revealed a preponderance of immature myeloid forms in the low-density CD11b fraction, which suggests that the late decrease in CD11b expression in some patients may be related to a greater proportion of circulating immature myeloid forms in the peripheral blood. This study suggests that GM-CSF administered as a continuous infusion rapidly upregulates the expression of granulocyte CD11b in vivo. The influence of this phenomenon on in vivo granulocyte aggregation may be clinically relevant with regard to the toxicity of GM-CSF and deserves further investigation.\r"

Doses ranging from 15 to 480 micrograms/m2 were administered as a one-hour or four-hour intravenous infusion daily for 7 days or as a 12-hour infusion for 14 days. Temporary improvements were seen in granulocyte counts, monocyte counts, and reticulocyte counts in six of eight patients with aplastic anemia and five of seven patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. The patients with myelodysplastic syndromes had larger increases in granulocyte, monocyte, and reticulocyte counts than did those with aplastic anemia, and they also had increases in the numbers of eosinophils (two of seven), immature myeloid cells (two of seven), and myeloblasts (two of seven) that were not observed in patients with aplastic anemia. There was no reduction in erythrocyte transfusion requirements, and no effect was observed on platelet counts. There was only minimal toxicity consisting of transient low-back discomfort, anorexia, myalgias/arthralgias, and low-grade fever. Our data suggest that GM-CSF is well tolerated and is more likely to result in elevations of blood counts in patients with myelodysplasia than in patients with aplastic anemia, but the role of GM-CSF therapy in these disorders remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "The authors conjugated, by a disulphide bond, the antihuman T-lymphocyte (CD5) monoclonal antibody (MoAb) OKT1 to the saporin-6 (SAP) ribosome-inactivating protein of the plant Saponaria officinalis. The resulting OKT1-SAP immunotoxin bound to CD5-expressing target cells and under standard culture conditions specifically suppressed mitogen-induced-T-lymphocyte DNA and protein synthesis in a dose-related manner. T-lymphocyte killing was achieved by five-minute exposure of the target cells to OKT1-SAP. The concentration inhibiting 50% (IC50) of T-lymphocyte DNA synthesis was 0.32 nmol/L. The potency of OKT1-SAP was moderately enhanced by amantadine (IC50 0.08 nmol/L) but not by ammonium chloride or chloroquine. Whole blood components did not interfere with the efficacy of OKT1-SAP, as in vitro treatment of fresh whole blood resulted in effective elimination of clonable peripheral blood T-lymphocytes assessed by a limiting dilution assay. Because these characteristics of T-lymphocyte killing by OKT1-SAP (ie, rapidity of action, potency also without potentiators) and lack of inhibition by whole blood components may be relevant for the use of an immunotoxin as a therapeutic agent in humans, the authors evaluated the stability in vivo and the circulatory clearance of OKT1-SAP in cynomolgus monkeys. Following a single intravenous (IV) injection of nontoxic dosages (0.16 to 1.3 mg/kg), an initial rapid decline (t1/2 alpha = 1.0 to 4.1 hours) was followed by a long-lasting slower decrease (t1/2 beta = 11.6 to 20.6 hours) of OKT1-SAP plasma concentrations as detected by double-antibody solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. Not only did OKT1-SAP remain intact immunologically but it also retained its biological activity, as measured by the ability of plasma samples from monkeys given immunotoxin to inhibit DNA synthesis in human T-lymphocytes. Taken together the findings presented in this article indicate the feasibility of using OKT1-SAP as a therapeutic tool and provide information that will facilitate the rational use of immunotoxins as a treatment modality in humans.\r"

Seventy-four percent of 23 patients with active MM had higher p21 fluorescence in aneuploid tumor cells than were observed in normal donor or myeloma remission bone marrows; 39% of the 23 patients also showed high H-ras p21 expression in diploid cells. There was an inverse relationship between p21 levels and the presence of trisomy 11; especially high p21 levels were noted in patient without trisomy 11. The frequent elevation of p21 protein in aneuploid plasma cells suggests the involvement of the H-ras oncogene in the pathophysiology of MM, which is further supported by a shorter survival among patients with high p21 levels.\r"

Inflammatory gut lesions were found in 65% of the patients with reactive arthritis (ReA) and in 57% of the patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), especially in those with peripheral arthritis. The controls had a normal gut. This finding would suggest that exogenous factors causing inflammation of the gut lead to a disturbed permeability of the gut wall or to a deficient local immunological defence mechanism permitting antigens to enter the circulation, inducing the joint and tendon inflammation. Support for this hypothesis was provided by the results of a repeat ileocolonoscopy, disclosing a strong association between the presence of gut inflammation on biopsy and the persistence of joint inflammation. Patients presenting some of the histological lesions found on biopsy (especially active chronic lesions) and patients with proven Crohn's disease were found to share a genetic marker (HLA-BW62). This would suggest that some of the patients with seronegative spondylarthropathies suffer from a subclinical form of Crohn's disease of which the joint symptoms are the unique clinical manifestation.\r"

This has resulted because of rule changes and their enforcement, equipment modifications, improved coaching and training techniques, and educational programs for coaches, trainers, and team physicians on the early recognition of head and neck injuries. However, morbidity data is not as complete, particularly as it applies to concussion, the most frequent type of head injury in contact sports. Questions on this condition that still need to be answered before a sound medical disposition can be made are the possible cumulative damage from repeated concussions, and whether one concussion renders a player more susceptible to a second. Presently, decisions on when to allow a football player to return to a game or participate in future contests are arbitrary and based primarily on the experience of the team physician. Data on the incidence, mechanisms, and prognosis of transient spinal cord signs and symptoms, such as spinal cord concussion and the central core symptoms, is also incomplete. What is the long-term prognosis for players who suffer frequent \"burners\"? Certainly, further studies are essential before these questions can be answered. Thus, the pioneer work of Richard Schneider needs to be continued.\r"

Each of these entities can be successfully treated with guided physical therapy following conservative management with rest, anti-inflammatory medications, and ice massage until the patient is pain free. Epiphyseal, diaphyseal, or pathologic fractures are rare entities that are secondary to violent trauma. These injuries are severe and often require operative intervention. Femoral neck fractures have a high rate of complications from avascular necrosis, nonunion, or malunion. Pelvic fractures have frequent associated genitourinary, abdominal, neurologic, and musculoskeletal injuries. Pathologic fractures are most commonly secondary to benign lesions, such as unicameral bone cysts, and less likely owing to malignancy. Finally, in children with hip pain during athletic activities, even with antecedent trauma, the sports clinician must screen for slipped capital femoral epiphysis, Perthes' disease, congenital subluxation of the hip, toxic synovitis, systemic neoplasia, or infectious process.\r"

In the management of ligament injuries and internal derangements, arthroscopy has profoundly changed diagnosis and treatment. Pathology can be precisely identified and the appropriate treatment initiated to preserve an athletic career and possibly prevent degenerative arthritis in adulthood. Lastly, patellofemoral pain continues to be a difficult problem to treat, but a more scientific approach is evolving.

After the diagnosis of a soft-tissue injury (sprain, strain, or contusion) has been made, treatment must include an initial 24- to 48-hour period of RICE. Appropriate splinting may be required. Rehabilitation then proceeds aggressively, with early restoration of strength, flexibility, and joint range of motion. Prior to return to full athletic activity, the athlete should meet the criteria outlined in this article. Protective taping or bracing may be necessary upon return to full activity. The treatment of soft-tissue injuries should start with prophylaxis. All predisposing factors to the development of injury should be sought on preparticipation physical examinations and corrected prior to allowing the young athlete to compete. Using the program described as a guide to treating the injured athlete should result in early return to function with low recurrence rates of injury.\r"

The amniotic fluid can be obtained and cultured. Combining the reported populations sampled, the procedural and cytogenetic failure rate were 2.0% and 0.3% respectively. The necessary information for prenatal diagnosis in the situations listed previously can be obtained. The one exception to this would be the patient at increased risk for NTD. As noted above, diagnostic levels for AFAFP have been established beginning at 13 weeks gestation. Therefore, amniocentesis before 13 weeks gestation should not be considered an option for these patients. The majority of the findings in these \"pilot\" studies have been promising, but the issue regarding the safety of EA has not been answered. Harrison et al. theorized that the function of the physiology hydramnios was to \"provide a distention growth stimulus to the uterus ... and conversely to share in the maintenance of uterine inhibition.\" The amniotic fluid is constantly being replaced, having a complete turnover approximately every 3 hours. Does the reduction in volume, for even a short period of time, change the \"distensive forces\" enough to increase the pregnancy loss rate? Later publications have associated MA with increased rates of congenital orthopedic anomalies and neonatal pulmonary compromise. The true existence of these complications continues to be debated in the literature. Two of the authors have indicated that none of the reported neonates exposed to EA have had such anomalies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The new antibiotics include interesting compounds--extended-spectrum cephalosporins and penicillins, combinations of older antibiotics plus beta-lactamase inhibitors, and new classes such as the monobactams and fluoroquinolones. In addition to extended spectrums, some of these compounds offer more favorable kinetics, less toxicity, or decreased cost. Several general conclusions might help place this array of new antibiotics in a useful clinical perspective. The newer antibiotics discussed here are no more effective than what is currently used. However, several have very good in-vitro activity against pelvic pathogens and are reasonable single-agent therapy in mild to moderate postpartum and postoperative infections. These antibiotics include cefoxitin, cefotetan, and piperacillin. Although moxalactam has good activity, its use is limited by concerns regarding bleeding disorders. Cefotaxime and cefoperazone have somewhat less favorable spectra, especially against anaerobes, yet in limited clinical trials are as effective as those cited above. Penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations are currently being evaluated and appear to be reasonable choices. Although imipenem has an excellent in-vitro spectrum, it should probably be reserved for resistant cases. Aztreonam offers an alternative to gentamicin. However, in view of its greater cost, its use should be limited to patients in whom renal toxicity is a concern. For serious infections, combination therapy with clindamycin and gentamicin is our preference. For pelvic inflammatory disease, none of the agents is recommended as sole therapy due to the lack of coverage for chlamydia and frequent suboptimal coverage for anaerobes. Many of these agents have been effective for prophylaxis, but none has been shown to be superior to the older, less expensive agents such as cefazolin. Although many are effective in single doses, it is also likely that cefazolin is equally effective as a single dose. In addition, while most of the newer antibiotics are resistant to beta-lactamases themselves, they may induce their formation. This may ultimately result in limitations to the use of the relatively inexpensive prophylactic antibiotics.\r"

During the period of neurologic recovery definitive surgical procedures are avoided. Techniques to temporarily reduce spasticity include the implantation of a MicroPort reservoir and catheter for repeated branchial plexus blocks and phenol nerve blocks, which provide longer lasting relief of noxious muscle tone. Percutaneous blocks of the musculocutaneous and recurrent median nerves and motor point blocks of the pectoralis major, the brachioradialis, and forearm flexor muscles are easily performed at bedside. The motor branch of the ulnar nerve can be injected surgically with phenol to diminish intrinsic spasticity. When neurologic recovery has plateaued, hand placement can be improved in many patients following proximal release of the brachioradialis muscle and lengthening of the biceps and branchialis tendons. Hand function is enhanced by fractional lengthening of spastic wrist and finger flexors. Intrinsic spasticity must be addressed at the same time by phenol block or intrinic release. When extensor function is lacking, a tenodesis of the wrist extensors is helpful. The thumb-in-palm deformity requires proximal release of the thenar muscles as well as lengthening of the flexor pollicis longus. Contracture releases in the nonfunctional arm improve hygiene and ease care.\r"

Chronic stimulation (12-24 hours per day for six weeks) results in a well-defined progression of changes in which a \"fast\" muscle becomes a typical \"slow\" muscle with a large decrease in force-generating capacity.

  ".U": "88295550\r", 
  ".W": "An organic phase is closely associated with the mineral substance is all calcified matrices, where it can be demonstrated as crystal-bound proteins by biochemical methods and as crystal ghosts by electron microscopy. Interest in crystal ghosts derives chiefly from the observation that they have the same shape, arrangement, and orientation as inorganic crystallites, which suggests they may have a role in their formation. Histochemically, crystal ghosts of epiphyseal cartilage react with colloidal iron (pH 2.0), acidic phosphotungstic acid, ruthenium red, and a number of cations including calcium, barium, magnesium, lanthanum, strontium, and terbium chloride. Their reactivity is removed by methylation and only incompletely restored by saponification. Moreover, the crystal ghosts located at the periphery of the calcified areas contain vic-glycol groups, as shown by their reactivity with periodic acid-silver nitrate and periodic acid-thiosemicarbazide-osmium. All these reactions show that the crystal ghosts of epiphyseal cartilage contain acidic, probably sulfate groups and, at least initially, vic-glycol groups. Their reactivity decreases as the calcification process is completed. Although the available data are not sufficient to allow a full understanding of the nature and function of these structures, they seem to play an important role in calcification. The hypothesis is presented that crystal ghosts are preformed in calcifying matrices and are activated by the unmasking of the reactive groups in their polymeric molecule; the unmasked groups then link up with inorganic ions in such a way to form organic-inorganic structures the inorganic ions of which are arranged in an apatitelike configuration and the filamentlike shape of which is the same as that of the polymeric molecule.\r"

The current clinical system consists of a shoulder position transducer controlling an external microprocessor-based stimulator, which excites paralyzed muscle via the peripheral nerve using percutaneous leads or a multichannel, implantable stimulator. Tendon transfer surgery of paralyzed but innervated muscle may augment the neurologically deficient upper extremity by allowing the substitution of stronger motors or the addition of new motors where flaccid paralysis (dennervation) eliminates the usual muscle from a grasp pattern. Sensory feedback in the form of machine state and cognitive information can be provided to the normally innervated C5 dermatome skin by subcutaneous electrodes. C5- and C6-level tetraplegics using FNS can independently perform single-hand manipulative tasks at a level similar to that of subjects with intact C7 roots, although they lack the elbow control.\r"

The left and right hind limbs of the test and control animals were instrumented and fractured identically. DMSO was applied daily to the skin of only one limb in the test animals. DMSO reduced postinjury ankle stiffness in both ankles of the test rabbits by 41% but had no effect on limb swelling compared to control rabbits. Postulated mechanisms of decreased joint stiffness include oxygen-free radical scavenging and inhibition of fibroblast proliferation.\r"

Later, improved modified cow's milk preparations became commercially available and were well tolerated by most infants. As a result, near cessation of ecological breastfeeding occurred toward the middle of the century. The decline in ecological breastfeeding was associated with early postpartum ovulation and shortened child-spacing of about 1 year. The endocrinology of breastfeeding is now known in considerable detail. Prolactin is secreted promptly in response to nipple stimulation and is a reliable marker of the endocrine alterations occurring postpartum. Success of lactation in suppression of ovulation was found to occur when infants sucked frequently and when only small amounts of selected foods were introduced gradually after the infants were about 6 months of age.\r"

During a 14-month period, 58 patients with suspected AMI were evaluated by their GP using a protocol with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The GP alerted a special mobile intervention team which administered APSAC at home in 13 of the 19 patients. Coronary reperfusion was achieved in ten of these 13 patients. Apart from short and easily treated episodes of bradycardia and/or hypotension after the injection of the thrombolytic drug in four of 13 patients, no major adverse events were noted in the early treatment period. The estimated time gain by treating the patient at home instead of starting the treatment in the coronary care unit was 46 +/- 14 min. Therefore, at-home initiation of thrombolytic treatment seems feasible, fast, and safe.\r"

Every 96 h, all catheters were semiquantitatively (SQ) cultured and the percutaneous entry site was swab cultured. Sites were used indefinitely by exchanging the catheters over a guide-wire every 96 h as long as arterial monitoring was necessary and SQ cultures remained negative (less than or equal to 15 colonies). No sites used less than 96 h developed skin colonization, while 14/51 (27%) sites used greater than 96 h developed positive swab cultures. No SQ cultures were positive in sites with negative swab cultures (p less than .001). Catheter-related infection (a positive SQ culture) developed in 4/42 (9.5%) radial or femoral sites compared to 4/9 (44%) axillary sites used greater than 96 h (p less than .01). It is concluded that arterial catheter-related infection develops in less than 10% of radial or femoral sites used greater than 96 h, and 90% of radial and femoral sites may be used safely for prolonged periods if skin colonization at the percutaneous sites is controlled and SQ catheter cultures remain negative. Skin site swab cultures may be useful for determining when arterial catheters should be removed and SQ cultured.\r"

Recently, a role for free radicals has been proposed in the mortality associated with Gram-negative bacterial sepsis. To determine if pretreatment with free radical scavengers can prevent endotoxin-induced mortality, mice rendered sensitive to endotoxin with actinomycin D were treated with either superoxide dismutase (SOD), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or saline and were then challenged with a dose of endotoxin calculated to cause a mortality of greater than 80%. Mortality was assessed at 12-h intervals after challenge. Increased survival was seen in the SOD-treated group compared to the control group (p less than or equal to .05). In contrast, survival in mice treated with NAC, another potential scavenger, was not significantly different from the control group. These results support the hypothesis that superoxide and hydroxyl radicals contribute to mortality in Gram-negative bacterial sepsis.\r"

We examined whether four commonly used pressure-limited, constant flow ventilators limit pressure reliably during simulated active expiration against the inspiratory stroke of the ventilator. Three machines of each type were tested at 13 different expiratory flow rates (2 to 14 L/min). Flow-dependent pressure overshoot above a dialed pressure limit of 20 cm H2O was observed in all machines. However, the magnitude differed significantly between ventilators from different manufacturers (p = .0009). Pressure overshoot above 20 cm H2O was consistently lowest in the Healthdyne (0.8 cm H2O at 2 L/min, 3.6 cm H2O at 14 L/min) and highest in the Bourns BP200 (3.0 cm H2O at 2 L/min, 15.4 cm H2O at 14 L/min). We conclude that peak inspiratory pressure overshoots on pressure-limited ventilators occur during asynchronous expiration. This shortcoming may contribute to barotrauma in newborn infants who \"fight\" positive-pressure ventilation.\r"

Five hundred fifty-six patients underwent a modified Whitehead hemorrhoidectomy, performed by one author (C.E.C.), between 1963 and 1983. Seventy-two of these patients had unclaimed follow-up letters, leaving 484 patients available for review. Four hundred forty of these patients were followed for over three years. Postoperative complications included fistula or abscess in 1.1 percent, flap loss in 6.9 percent, and a nonhealing wound in one patient. There were no recurrences and there was no ectropion formation, or \"Whitehead deformity.\" Mortality was zero and total morbidity, including 7.2 percent flap detachment, was 12.2%. A modified Whitehead technique has become the authors' procedure of choice for circumferential prolapsing and bleeding hemorrhoids and mucosa.\r"

High-resolution ultrasound clearly depicted five- or seven-layer echographic structures in the normal rectal wall, and demonstrated cancer as a hypoechoic lesion. These layer structures provided an important feature in determining the depth of cancer invasion. Rectal cancers of 122 patients were examined thoroughly by endorectal ultrasound. In 95 of these patients (77.9 percent), ultrasonic assessment of the depth of cancer invasion as classified in four groups was correct, corresponding accurately to the microscopic findings. Ultrasonography overestimated the depth of cancer invasion in 21 patients, however, and underestimated it in six patients. This study indicated that a cause of the overestimation was inflammatory cell infiltration around cancer, and that one possible cause of underestimation was microscopically minimal invasion of cancer. Although there are certain limitations of endorectal ultrasound, this ultrasound technique will provide valuable information to determine the preoperative staging of rectal cancer.\r"

The updated answers to all these questions are given through an extensive review of the world literature and confronted with the authors' experience of eight years of follow-up in a series of 170 colorectal cancer patients treated for cure. Although the future might be more promising, past world experience suggests only a few patients could be saved. It is concluded that there is no place for incomplete and disperse screening tests, and only comprehensive, intensive, and very well-coordinated follow-up programs should be undertaken if better results are hoped to be achieved.\r"

We have found that a short period of intense exercise (80% VO2max) in normal lean subjects produces sustained postexercise hyperglycemia 20% above basal with a corresponding 100% increase in plasma insulin. In people with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) incapable of this insulin response, it was predicted that postexercise hyperglycemia would be of greater magnitude and/or duration. To investigate this possibility, the effects of the same intense exercise (80% VO2max) were studied in 8 IDDM subjects (2 on 2 occasions) in the postabsorptive state with continuous subcutaneous (abdominal) insulin infusion (CSII). When the preexercise plasma glucose was normal (n = 6, 86 +/- 4 mg/dl), there ensued a postexercise hyperglycemia to 127 +/- 7 mg/dl (P less than .001) sustained for 2 h postexhaustion. Plasma free immunoreactive insulin (IRI) was 1.43 +/- 0.12 ng/ml before exercise and did not change postexercise. When mean preexercise plasma glucose was 149 +/- 9 mg/dl (n = 4), it rose progressively throughout the 2 h of recovery to 229 +/- 28 mg/dl (P less than .025). A small but statistically significant decrease in free IRI occurred during the last 80 min of recovery. Hyperglycemia in the diabetic subjects was not explained by abnormal or differing responses of glucagon or catecholamines. Thus, with intense exercise, diabetic control deteriorates rather than improves. Therefore, different therapeutic strategies may be required for intense compared with moderate exercise in IDDM patients.\r"

Absolute differences between two consecutive fasting C-peptide concentrations in insulin-requiring patients were less than 0.1 nM in all but 1 patient, in whom the difference was 0.18 nM. In subjects treated with oral hypoglycemic agents the median difference was 0.12 nM (range 0-0.38 nM). Absolute differences between two consecutive postprandial C-peptide concentrations were all less than 0.1 nM in insulin-requiring patients. No significant difference was found between postprandial C-peptide concentrations with or without preceding administration of oral hypoglycemic agents (medians 1.35 and 1.30 nM, respectively). Glucagon-stimulated C-peptide concentrations were somewhat higher than the postprandial values. However, equal discrimination between insulin-requiring and non-insulin-requiring diabetic patients was found by measuring postprandial or glucagon-stimulated C-peptide concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Although plasma glucose and insulin responses have been shown to vary considerably when either normal subjects or patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) consume different carbohydrate-rich foods, it has been difficult to demonstrate this phenomenon when the same foods have been incorporated into a single mixed meal. To pursue this issue further, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were determined at hourly intervals from 0800 to 2100 h in NIDDM patients in response to three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) calculated to be of low-, intermediate-, and high-glycemic potency. The total integrated glucose response (mean +/- SE) during the day the low-glycemic meals were ingested was approximately 7% lower (2500 +/- 246 mg.dl-1.h-1) than on the days patients ate either the intermediate- (2701 +/- 280 mg.dl-1.h-1) or high- (2718 +/- 311 mg.dl-1.h-1) glycemic meals. When these data were analyzed by meal, it became apparent that the plasma glucose response to breakfast and dinner were essentially identical after consumption of the meals of either low-, intermediate-, or high-glycemic potency. Thus, the modest attenuation of the day-long glycemic response on the day patients ate the low-glycemic meal was due to a reduction in plasma glucose concentration after lunch. The day-long plasma insulin responses to the meals of different glycemic potency were qualitatively similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Using the artificial beta-cell (Biostator), we determined the insulin requirements in five nonobese type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects who received isocaloric 40 and 60% mixed-carbohydrate diets in a crossover randomized fashion for 4 days, each day consisting of four equal meals. This was followed on day 5 by a \"Big Mac Attack\" lunch consisting of a Big Mac, french fries, and milk shake. Insulin requirements to maintain normoglycemia were calculated for each 24-h period and for the 2 h after each meal. The mean 24-h insulin requirements to maintain normoglycemia was greater for the 60% carbohydrate diet than the 40% diet. Although the four meals were of equal size, in all patients the insulin required to cover breakfast greater than lunch greater than dinner greater than or equal to snack. Expressed as milliunits per kilocalorie, the amount of insulin to cover breakfast was greater for the 60% (P less than .05) than the 40% carbohydrate diet and greater for breakfast than the other meals (P less than .01). Insulin requirements for the Big Mac (43% carbohydrate) were 58% greater than for the 40% carbohydrate diet, even after correction for caloric differences. In summary, 1) increasing dietary carbohydrate from 40 to 60% results in an increased insulin requirement for meals only; 2) insulin requirements are greater in the morning than in the evening, even when meal size is constant; and 3) very large meals with high fat and carbohydrate content result in a major increase in insulin requirement. These data indicate that diet has an important impact on insulin requirements in diabetes.\r"

Treatment periods (4 wk) were separated by a 2-wk washout period. During the last week of each treatment period, three test meals (TMs) were administered: 60 g starch (TM1), 25 g sucrose (TM2), and combined 60 g starch and 25 g sucrose (TM3). Twelve subjects completed the study. The peak postprandial blood glucose, lactate, and pyruvate levels (means +/- SE) were significantly lower with active drug after all test meals, particularly TM2 (11.3 +/- 1.0 vs. 14.3 +/- 1.4 mM, P less than .001; 1.53 +/- 0.20 vs. 2.48 +/- 0.17 mM, P less than .001; and 105.1 +/- 17.6 vs. 147.6 +/- 11.1 microM, P less than) less than .001; and 105.1 +/- 17.6 vs. 147.6 +/- 11.1 microM, P less than .05, respectively. Peak blood glucose levels were significantly delayed. However, fasting blood glucose, HbA1, fructosamine, and cholesterol did not change during active treatment (10.0 +/- 1.0 vs. 9.9 +/- 1.0 mM, 10.0 +/- 0.7 vs. 9.4 +/- 0.7%, 2.44 +/- 0.10 vs. 2.37 +/- 0.07 mmol/100 g protein, and 6.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 6.5 +/- 0.3 mM, P NS). Flatulence and diarrhea were severe in 2 subjects, requiring termination of study. Thus, in NIDDM, BAYm 1099 was effective in diminishing and delaying postprandial excursions of blood glucose, lactate, and pyruvate after high- and low-sucrose meals, but overall metabolic control remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Forty-eight patients (20 diabetic, 28 nondiabetic) with angiographically confirmed peripheral vascular disease (PVD) were examined to discover whether the measurement of pulse reappearance time (PRT) during reactive hyperemia is a more useful method than the measurement of peripheral systolic blood pressure (ankle pressure index; API) for making a specific diagnosis of PVD. Specific diagnosis refers to the degree and localization of occlusive atherosclerosis determined by Doppler ultrasound techniques for both measurements. We found that PRT and API both provided accurate qualitative proof of a peripheral blood flow deficit in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. However, in relation to the angiographically defined degree and localization of sclerotic lesions, there were significant differences. The sclerotic degree of occlusive PVD in diabetic subjects was correlated with the results of the PRT (P less than .001), whereas the API was not (P greater than .05). The occlusion localization could only be distinguished by PRT measurements in both diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. Compared with control subjects (4.1 s) the half-maximum PRT of blood flow velocity was delayed in stenotic PVD to 5.7 s, in occlusive PVD of the upper leg to 14.3 s, in occlusive PVD of the lower leg to 29.6 s, and in multilevel disease to 45.0 s (P less than .0005 vs. control). The results show that Doppler sonographic measurement of the peripheral systolic blood pressure is only useful for an overall diagnosis of PVD in diabetic subjects, whereas PRT measurement, by quantifying the degree and localization of sclerotic lesions, can be used additionally either to confirm or to specify this diagnosis.\r"

Of this group, 219 youngsters had a full 3-yr period of observation. At each clinic visit, blood was obtained for fasting blood glucose and HbA1 and, once a year, cholesterol and triglycerides were also measured. Patient and parent accuracy in measuring CBG was found to be adequate. The changes over time in HbA1 were nondifferential across age and sex, and there was no difference in the level of HbA1 between age and sex groups, the number of tests reported to have been done by the patients, the number of injections of insulin per day, or the serum cholesterol. There was a significant relationship between the HbA1 and the fasting blood glucose (P less than .001) measured by the laboratory as well as with the serum triglyceride (P less than .01). The failure to improve diabetic control, despite measures that would have been expected to do so, was believed to relate more to a lack of compliance than to a flaw in the therapeutic approach. It was interesting to note that the adolescent patients in the study were in no worse control than the younger children in the group. Although better technical skills are available today to manage diabetes, the psychosocial approach to patient motivation requires improvement.\r"

In 8 nondiabetic subjects, salivary insulin levels increased after an oral glucose load but with a delay in peak concentrations of approximately 45 min in comparison with serum insulin levels. There was a significant correlation (r = .810, P less than .01) between mean serum insulin and the salivary insulin 30 min later. In 12 type I diabetic patients, day profiles of saliva and serum insulin were obtained during usual insulin treatment, diet, and physical activity. In serum, the mean (+/- SE) percentage of bound insulin was 58.8 +/- 5.2%, and in saliva it was 45 +/- 3.5%. The mean ratio of salivary to serum free insulin throughout the day was 1:1.6. Although there was a significant correlation (r = .913, P less than .001) between mean serum free insulin for all patients and the corresponding mean free salivary insulin, several individual profiles showed marked discrepancies between the timing and magnitude of insulin changes in the two compartments. We would not, therefore, recommend salivary insulin concentrations as a reliable index of insulinemia in individuals with type I diabetes.\r"

Blood glucose levels were significantly improved in clofibrate-treated groups at all time points during OGTT, whereas there was no change in insulin levels. Improvement of fasting glucose levels required 8 wk of clofibrate treatment. Insulin binding to erythrocytes demonstrated no significant change in the clofibrate-treated subjects. These results suggest that clofibrate improves glucose tolerance in NIDDM subjects without a change in insulin receptors and that clofibrate increases insulin sensitivity through an unknown postreceptor mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "States of hyperinsulinemia with resistance to insulin action on glucose disposal are frequently associated with proliferative tissue abnormalities of the skin (acanthosis nigricans), ovary, and heart. That insulin may be involved in the pathogenesis of these growth-related abnormalities despite resistance to its metabolic effects mediated through the insulin receptor is suggested by the known ability of high concentrations of insulin to stimulate DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in vitro through the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor. IGF-I receptors are present in skin keratinocytes, some ovarian tissue compartments, and in the heart. Furthermore, ovarian tissue from hyperinsulinemic insulin-resistant women responds to supraphysiologic insulin concentrations in vitro by enhanced steroidogenesis. Cultured, transformed T-lymphocytes from an infant with leprechaunism fail to augment basal-colony formation in response to physiologic insulin concentrations in vitro (compared to a doubling seen in normal subjects), but respond normally to supraphysiologic insulin concentrations, the effect of which is competitively inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to the IGF-I receptor. Thus, insulin action mediated through the IGF-I receptor may initiate growth-promoting tissue effects in the face of limited insulin effect on glucose metabolism. Such spillover actions may add to the morbidity associated with states of clinical insulin resistance.\r"

Fetal rat pituitary primordia were explanted at 14 days gestation and cultured for 7 days in medium supplemented with cortisol (50-500 nM), and either T3 (0.67 nM) or glucagon (0.5 nM). Also, to determine the time of first appearance of the somatotropes, explants were cultured 4, 5, or 6 days with cortisol alone. Immunoreactive somatotropes were detected by immunohistochemistry, and their size and number were estimated for each medium. GH was measured by RIA in explants and media. Immunoreactive somatotropes first appear at 18-19 days gestation. Their size and number depend on cortisol concentration: no cells at 50 nM, a few small ones at 100 nM, and many large ones at 250-500 nM. This progression was reflected by RIA of GH in explants and media, although small quantities were detected with 50 nM. The effect of T3 was only visible with a low dose of cortisol. With 100 nM cortisol, it increased the size and number of cells. Differentiation was also triggered with 50 nM cortisol plus T3. RIA detected significantly higher GH content and secretion after T3 stimulation. The decreases in number, size, and GH secretion and content elicited by glucagon were not significant, probably due to the high variability. Both techniques used provide similar information on somatotrope differentiation: stimulation by cortisol alone, or alternatively by a synergistic action between cortisol and T3.\r"

Plasma ACTH levels increased at 30 and 60 min, while ME CRF content decreased at 30 and 60 min, then returned to the control level at 90 min. Hybridization with a cRNA probe revealed a single size class of CRF mRNA in the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex (approximately 1300 nucleotides), and the size of CRF mRNA in these tissues did not change during the experimental period. CRF mRNA levels in the hypothalamus increased to 130% of the control value at 30 min and reached a peak (186% of the control value) at 120 min, but these levels in the cerebral cortex did not change. These results suggest that insulin-induced hypoglycemia stimulates CRF synthesis by increasing CRF mRNA levels in the hypothalamus as well as CRF release, and that release and synthesis of CRF in the cerebral cortex are independent of those in the hypothalamus.\r"

Using an N-terminal and C-terminal synthetic peptide, we developed two sensitive and specific RIAs for the detection of pancreastatin-like immunoreactivity (PLI) in porcine and human tissue extracts. PLI was present throughout the gastrointestinal tract and in most endocrine and neuronal tissues. Highest concentrations were measured in the pituitary, adrenal gland, and pancreas (1200-4000 pmol/g), similar to the distribution of chromogranin-A. PLI was also detected in human endocrine tumors, with large quantities in some carcinoids (up to 14 nmol/g). HPLC revealed that extracts from porcine pituitary and pancreas contained small pancreastatin-like peptides, whereas in adrenal medulla large chromogranin-A-like molecular forms predominated. Human endocrine tumors showed a different pattern, with intermediate forms distinct from chromogranin-A and pancreastatin. Biochemical analysis was confirmed by immunocytochemistry localizing PLI in pancreatic islets, adrenal medulla, pituitary, duodenum, and human endocrine tumors. Pancreastatin is present in a variety of gastrointestinal, endocrine, and neuronal tissues and may represent a novel peptide of unknown physiological function, derived from chromogranin-A by proteolytic cleavage.\r"

  ".U": "88296343\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that in rat H4 hepatoma cells insulin enhances the nuclear transcription of p33 mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with no alteration in mRNA half-time (t1/2). Presumably, this effect is mediated by the cell surface receptor. In this report, we have investigated the effect of putative insulin mediator fractions which act to control metabolic events on p33 mRNA accumulation in these cells. Initial experiments originally demonstrated an insulin-like effect of an added putative metabolic fraction to enhance p33 mRNA concentrations. However, when the fetal calf serum supply was changed, the effect of insulin remained, but that of added mediator was no longer observed. After a series of experimental approaches designed to alter the permeability of the cell membrane, it was found that in the presence of increased Ca2+, the effect of mediator could again be observed. The present data demonstrate that the partially purified cAMP-dependent protein kinase/adenylate cyclase inhibitory putative mediator fractions from liver and muscle enhance p33 mRNA accumulation in intact H4 hepatoma cells by a mechanism that is differentiated from that of insulin. The action of the putative mediator is inhibited by cycloheximide, while the action of insulin itself is not. These results suggest that insulin may control nuclear transcription by multiple signaling mechanisms. Alternatively, the added putative metabolic mediator may not enter the cell in the presence of cycloheximide or is inactive as such within the cell and must first be converted to an active species by a step requiring protein synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "A naturally occurring pituitary peptide, human (h) GH-(1-43) potentiates insulin action. The present study has compared the effects of acute (30-60 min) and chronic (3-6 days) injections of synthetic hGH-(1-43), hGH, and insulin in normal, diabetic, hypophysectomized, and diabetic-hypophysectomized rats. Male rats (150-250 g) received injections of saline, insulin (50-200 mU), hGH (200 micrograms), or hGH-(1-43) (200-400 micrograms) with or without insulin. Hormone and glucose were injected simultaneously for glucose tolerance tests. Basal and insulin-stimulated [U-14C]glucose oxidation to 14CO2 in adipose tissue were measured in vitro after in vivo treatments; insulin release by isolated pancreatic islets was determined in vitro. Acute injections of hGH-(1-43) with insulin dramatically increased glucose clearance in diabetic (P less than 0.05) and hypophysectomized (P less than 0.01) rats. In diabetic-hypophysectomized rats acute injections of hGH-(1-43) significantly lowered the elevated basal blood glucose level (P less than 0.025) and stimulated [U-14C]glucose oxidation to 14CO2 in adipose tissue (P less than 0.05); it did not increase the glucose clearance rate during glucose administration. Chronic treatment of diabetic rats with hGH-(1-43) did not lower the elevated blood glucose level significantly, but it stimulated [U-14C]glucose oxidation to 14CO2 in adipose tissue; the oxidation was further stimulated by treatment with insulin. Chronic injections of hGH-(1-43) slightly lowered blood glucose levels in hypophysectomized rats (P less than 0.025) despite a diminished release in vitro of insulin from pancreatic islets (P less than 0.05). Therefore, these experiments show hGH-(1-43) to be an insulin potentiator that increases insulin-stimulated glucose clearance and glucose oxidation without an increase in insulin secretion, and they suggest that the peptide may have a physiological role in regulating carbohydrate metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "This study demonstrates that the threshold of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion can be regulated in vivo by long term hormonal and nutrient modifications. The sensitivity of the pancreatic B-cell to glucose stimulation was determined by examining the pattern of insulin release from pancreases perfused with linear glucose gradients. Male rats infused with ovine PRL for 4 days and rats receiving five hourly injections of glucose had a lower threshold and enhanced rates of insulin release at all stimulatory glucose concentrations. Infusion of bGH for 4 days was without effect on glucose gradient-stimulated insulin release. Fasting the rats for 48 h resulted in an elevation of the threshold and a substantial reduction in the extent of insulin release. To determine possible processes involved in these long term modifications of the threshold of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, the in vitro effect of potentiators of insulin release was examined. Forskolin, glucagon, cholecystokinin, and carbamylcholine were able to lower the threshold and increase the extent of insulin release. This suggests that the long term regulation of insulin secretion may modulate processes controlling cAMP concentrations and the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides in pancreatic B-cells. Also, the proposed incretin gastric inhibitory polypeptide was capable of lowering the threshold and increasing insulin secretion at stimulatory glucose concentrations. The consequences of a decreased threshold is a markedly enhanced insulin secretion at normal serum glucose concentrations.\r"

  ".U": "88296348\r", 
  ".W": "Equine Cushing's disease is caused by an adenomatous hyperplasia of the intermediate pituitary which secretes high levels of beta-endorphin, ACTH, and other peptide derivatives of POMC. In the present study we found that plasma and cerebrospinal fluid immunoreactive beta-endorphin (i beta-endorphin) levels were 60- and 120-fold higher than control values in horses with Cushing's disease. There were no significant differences in intermediate lobe i beta-endorphin concentrations, although anterior lobe i beta-endorphin was significantly reduced in Cushing's horses, presumably because high levels of circulating glucocorticoids inhibit POMC biosynthesis in corticotrophs. Although the i beta-endorphin concentration of the tumors was not different from that in normal tissue, the posttranslational processing of beta-endorphin in the two tissues differed significantly. In controls, beta-endorphin-(1-31) was extensively processed to N-acetyl-beta-endorphin-(1-31), -(1-27), and -(1-26) and des-acetyl beta-endorphin-(1-27). N-Acetyl-beta-endorphin-(1-27) was the predominant form, constituting 57% of the total i beta-endorphin, whereas beta-endorphin-(1-31) was quantitatively minor (less than 7% of the total immunoreactivity. In adenomatous pituitaries, the processing of beta-endorphin was restricted, significantly increasing the proportions of beta-endorphin-(1-31) and N-acetyl-beta-endorphin-(1-31) and lowering the amounts of N-acetyl-beta-endorphin-(1-27) and -(1-26). These changes in peptide processing were associated with markedly reduced levels of dopamine, suggesting that the dopaminergic neurons that normally control intermediate lobe secretion no longer innervate the hyperplastic tissue. These findings are consistent with evidence that the dopaminergic innervation of the intermediate pituitary regulates the posttranslational processing and release of beta-endorphin.\r"

Although GnRH message levels were lowest on the morning of proestrus, they rose nearly two-fold by 1900h that evening and remained high during the day of estrus. These data support the hypothesis that GnRH synthesis is coupled to GnRH release, and indicate that GnRH biosynthesis is not stimulated on the morning of proestrus in preparation for the ovulatory surge release of GnRH and LH in the afternoon.\r"

Other measures are worth considering and, if instituted, will reduce the frequency of severe complications from long-term catheterization and improve quality of life.\r"

Liver glycogen content decreased 22.4 mg/g in saline-infused rats compared with 13.6 mg/g in glucose-infused rats during the first 40 min of treadmill running (21 m/min, 15% grade). Liver adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) concentration was significantly lower in the glucose-infused rats during the exercise bout. The concentration of hepatic fructose 2,6-bisphosphate remained elevated throughout the exercise bout in glucose-infused rats but decreased markedly in saline-infused rats. Plasma insulin concentration was higher and plasma glucagon concentration lower in glucose-infused rats than in saline-infused rats during exercise. Early in exercise, liver glycogenolysis proceeds in the glucose-infused rats despite the fact that glucose and insulin concentrations are markedly elevated and liver cAMP is unchanged from resting values. These observations suggest the existence of a cAMP-independent feedforward system for activation of liver glycogenolysis that can override classical negative feedback mechanisms during exercise.\r"

However, the value of the mouse for the analysis of pulmonary pathophysiology has been limited by the lack of methods for measuring lung function in the living animal. We report here the first method for measuring pulmonary conductance (GL) and compliance (Cdyn) in tracheostomized mechanically ventilated mice. We used this method to characterize the mouse's pulmonary responses to several putative bronchoconstrictor agonists. GL and Cdyn were decreased by intravenous infusions of methacholine, norepinephrine, or serotonin. Reproducible responses were not detected after infusions of histamine, prostaglandins D2 or F2 alpha, leukotrienes C4 or D4, substance P, or platelet-activating factor. The pattern of airway responsiveness to these agonists in the mouse is similar to that reported for the rat; in contrast to the rat, the mouse has many well-characterized strains or mutants with deficiencies of immunologic or inflammatory cells or mediators. As a result, this model offers unique advantages for identifying the roles of individual inflammatory cell types or mediators in pulmonary processes, including pulmonary anaphylaxis.\r"

Seven moderately trained human male subjects serving as their own controls participated in two bicycle exercise sessions (120 min, 50% of VO2max). The second exercise was preceded by 5 days of oral carnitine supplementation (CS; 5 g daily). Despite a doubling of plasma carnitine levels, with CS, there were no effects on exercise-induced changes in arterial levels and turnover of FFA, the relation between leg FFA inflow and FFA uptake, or the leg exchange of other substrates. Heart rate during exercise after CS decreased 7-8%, but O2 uptake was unchanged. Exercise before CS induced a fall from 33.4 +/- 1.6 to 30.8 +/- 1.0 (SE) mumol/l in free plasma carnitine despite a release (2.5 +/- 0.9 mumol/min) from the leg. Simultaneously, acylated plasma carnitine rose from 5.0 +/- 1.0 to 14.2 +/- 1.4 mumol/l, with no evidence of leg release. Consequently, total plasma carnitine increased. We concluded that in healthy subjects CS does not influence muscle substrate utilization either at rest or during prolonged exercise and that free carnitine released from muscle during exercise is presumably acylated in the liver and released to plasma.\r"

  ".W": "Goats were divided into three groups and given infusions of live Escherichia coli bacteria. Group I received no treatment, group II was treated with indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor), and group III with dazoxiben (a thromboxane synthase inhibitor). Double indicator-dilution extravascular lung water (EVLW) in group I was significantly different from the treated groups. There was an early increase in EVLW in group I and group III but not in group II animals. At 6 h EVLW's in group I, group II, and group III were 100, 45, and 30% above base line, respectively. Lymph flow (QL) and lymph-to-plasma protein ratio (L/P) was not statistically different between groups. Estimated total fluid filtration [QL + d(EVLW)/dt] in group I and III was markedly elevated between 0 and 1.5-2 h after E. coli infusion. Cardiac output (QT) decreased to 40% of base line in group I, and it decreased slightly in group II because of the indomethacin but did not decrease after E. coli. QT decreased in group III but recovered more rapidly than group I. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased more rapidly in group I and reached a higher peak than either treated group. At 6 h these groups had similar pulmonary arterial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures. We conclude that 1) indomethacin but not dazoxiben blocks the early increase in total fluid filtration after bacterial infusion, 2) dazoxiben does not prevent the increased endothelial permeability resulting from infusion of live bacteria, and 3) indomethacin may somewhat ameliorate the endothelial permeability change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All were skin-test-negative to 29 aeroallergens and had base-line pulmonary function values greater than 80% predicted. Fourteen (28%) subjects had a drop in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 20% or greater at a provocative dose (PD20FEV1) less than or equal to 225 breath units. Moreover, when these subjects were compared with 21 asymptomatic allergic asthmatics, there was significant overlap between the two groups in concentration of methacholine causing this decline in FEV1. A positive MBPC at methacholine concentrations less than or equal to 5 mg/ml was not diagnostic of asthma, and a negative MBPC at methacholine concentrations greater than or equal to 10 mg/ml did not rule out asthma. These data strongly suggest that MBPC should not be used as the sole factor for the diagnosis of clinically significant asthma. A positive MBPC is one indication of the presence of airway hyperresponsiveness and thus is only one of many factors that must be considered in the diagnosis of asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Ferret tracheal segments were infected with human influenza virus A/Taiwan/86 (H1N1) in vitro. After 4 days, the smooth muscle contractile responses to acetylcholine and to substance P were measured. The response to substance P was markedly accentuated, with a threefold increase in force of contraction at a substance P concentration of 10(-5) M, the highest concentration tested. In contrast, the response to acetylcholine was not affected by viral infection. Histological examination of tissues revealed extensive epithelial desquamation. Activity of enkephalinase (neutral metallo-endopeptidase, EC.3.4.24.11), an enzyme that degrades substance P, was decreased by 50% in infected tissues. Inhibiting enkephalinase activity by pretreating with thiorphan (10(-5) M) increased the response to substance P to the same final level in both infected and control tissues. Inhibiting other substance P-degrading enzymes including kininase II (angiotensin-converting enzyme), serine proteases, and aminopeptidases did not affect the response to substance P. Inhibiting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activity using indomethacin and BW 755c did not affect hyperresponsiveness to substance P. Pretreating tissues with antagonists of alpha-adrenoceptors, beta-adrenoceptors, and H1 histamine receptors (phentolamine 10(-5) M, propranolol 5 X 10(-6) M, and pyrilamine 10(-5) M, respectively) had no effect on substance P-induced contraction. These results demonstrate that infection of ferret airway tissues with influenza virus increases the contractile response of airway smooth muscle to substance P. This effect is caused by decreased enkephalinase activity in infected tissues.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to investigate the interaction between carotid sinus baroreceptors and cardiopulmonary receptors in the reflex control of renal nerve activity (RNA) during positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in anesthetized dogs. PEEP at two different levels (10 and 20 cmH2O) was applied to the following groups: animals with neuraxis intact (I group, n = 12); vagal and aortic nerve denervated animals with carotid sinus nerves intact (V group, n = 6); carotid sinus denervated animals with vagal and aortic nerves intact (SD group, n = 6); and carotid sinus denervated animals also having severed vagal and aortic nerves (SAV group, n = 12). Mean blood pressure (MBP), central venous pressure, and mean airway pressure were also simultaneously measured. In the I group, no significant alterations in RNA occurred during PEEP at both levels, even when MBP fell significantly. Although the drop in MBP in the SD group was similar to that in the I group, RNA decreased significantly 10 s after intervention at both PEEP levels, followed by a recovery of RNA toward the control level. In contrast, a significant increase in RNA, which continued until the end of PEEP, appeared in the V group immediately after each intervention. In the SAV group, RNA responses to PEEP, which were observed in the other groups, were abolished. These results provide evidence that during PEEP, renal nerve activity is modified by an interaction between carotid sinus baroreceptors and cardiopulmonary receptors; excitatory effects occur via carotid sinus nerves and inhibitory effects occur via vagal afferents.\r"

  ".W": "Because in vitro studies indicate that pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM's) filled with phospholipid vesicles have depressed microbicidal capacity, we tested the intrapulmonary bactericidal activity of newborn PAM's after surfactant treatment. Term newborn rabbits received intratracheally either homologous surfactant or one of two artificial phospholipid vesicle preparations followed by pulmonary aerosol infection with group B streptococci (GBS). Four hours after lung infection, phagocytic killing of GBS was reduced by 70-90% in animals treated with the homologous and one of the artificial surfactants compared with untreated animals or animals that received intrapulmonary injections of the surfactant vehicle (P less than 0.02). The other artificial phospholipid preparation decreased intrapulmonary inactivation of GBS by 30-40% compared with the controls. The phospholipid vesicles in the three preparations were avidly ingested and processed by newborn PAM's. The diminished in vivo killing of GBS was not attributed to decreased viability or phagocytic behavior of the PAM's toward GBS. The bactericidal defect that was evident in the newborn PAM's appeared related to the uptake of large phospholipid vesicles in the preparations rather than to the phospholipid content of the surfactants themselves. When in vitro conditions that stimulated the alveolar environment were used, the natural surfactant preparation promoted GBS proliferation, whereas the artificial preparations did not. Our findings indicate that surfactant administration reduces the bactericidal activity of neonatal PAM's. We conclude that additional investigations are needed to ascertain the effect of surfactant replacement therapy on lost defenses of the lung.\r"

A control group of dogs and a group of dogs in which dextran was infused created all levels of pulmonary edema. In an emboli group 0.125 g/kg of starch microemboli (63-74 micron diam) were infused. In groups with emboli and CPPV, starch emboli were infused and CPPV was then applied at 15 cmH2O. In an airway saline group measured amounts of saline were poured into the airway. In all groups postmortem pulmonary extravascular tissue weight (PETW) was determined and compared with the last ETVL. Emboli created an increased scatter when the last ETVL is compared with PETW because 1) blood trapped distal to emboli was included in the ETVL measurement, and/or 2) diffusion limitations for the thermal indicator were exceeded. Emboli and CPPV decreased ETVL/PETW. Airway saline (80 +/- 5%) was measured by ETVL. In conclusion, the ETVL technique is reliable in well-perfused lungs but loses accuracy in measuring lung water after emboli of any size or with large amounts of airway fluid.\r"

Adrenalectomized rats were injected with corticosterone (ADX Cort) or corn oil (ADX) 5 min before exercise. Rats were killed at rest or after running on a treadmill (21 m/min, 15% grade) until exhaustion. SO rats ran 138 +/- 6 min compared with 114 +/- 9 min for ADX Cort and 89 +/- 8 min for ADX. All differences in run times were significant (P less than 0.05). Corticosterone levels were similar in exhausted SO and ADX Cort groups. ADX exhausted rats had corticosterone levels similar to resting values in SO and ADX rats. Inhibition of the rise in glucocorticoids during exercise had no effect on liver glycogen, liver adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, plasma insulin, blood glucose, lactate, glycerol, or 3-hydroxybutyrate, plasma norepinephrine, or red quadriceps and soleus glycogen. Plasma free fatty acids were significantly depressed at exhaustion in ADX rats compared with SO. These data show that glucocorticoids exert effects within the time frame of a prolonged exercise bout and play a role in increasing endurance.\r"

Pupil diameter measured in dark and light test conditions declined with age (Pearson's r = -0.54 and -0.36). Pupillary alpha-adrenergic responsiveness (expressed as the concentration of phenylephrine required to dilate the pupil 1 mm) was significantly correlated with age. Older subjects required lower concentrations for dilation and therefore were more sensitive to phenylephrine. Pupillary cholinergic responsiveness (the concentration of carbachol required for 1-mm constriction) was not significantly correlated with age. Therefore the significantly smaller baseline pupil size in the elderly cannot be explained by failure of alpha-adrenergic receptor responses or by increased pupillary cholinergic responsiveness. We found no significant correlation of methacholine bronchial reactivity with age. In addition, there was no relation between airway reactivity and pupillary alpha-adrenergic or cholinergic responsiveness in this sample of healthy adults. These findings, taken with others in the literature, suggest that the contribution of alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic responsiveness to nonspecific airway reactivity in healthy persons is small, if it exists at all, and that there is no significant change in airway reactivity with age in healthy adults.\r"

During successful trials VE and arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) were sustained at base-line levels, and an increase in peak integrated diaphragmatic EMG activity and peak inspiratory Paw occurred. In contrast, during ventilatory failure runs, VE decreased and PaCO2 rose compared with their respective base-line values. The fall in VE occurred secondary to a significant decline in breathing frequency. Tidal volume was sustained at base-line levels during all trials (both successful and failed groups). Inspiratory Paw's and peak moving time average EMG were sustained at elevated levels during ventilatory failure runs, suggesting that the respiratory muscles did not fail as pressure generators. Furthermore, the EMG Fc did not change from base line during either successful or failed trials. These data suggest that peripheral muscle fatigue did not occur, although in the absence of a more direct test of muscle performance, i.e., a force-frequency curve, we cannot rule out the possibility that a component of peripheral failure contributed to our results. Ventilatory failure during severe IRL in the infant monkey was most clearly associated with an alteration in the respiratory center timing mechanism, i.e., such failure was a function of a decline in respiratory frequency.\r"

Six adult males were dehydrated to 2.3% of their body weight by an exercise-heat regimen, followed by rehydration (180 min) with tap water (H2O-R) or 0.45% NaCl solution (Na-R). We measured plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone levels (PA) before dehydration (control), after dehydration, and at 60, 120, and 180 min of rehydration. During the 3-h rehydration period, subjects, restored 51% of the water lost during H2O-R and 71% during Na-R (P less than 0.05). Plasma volume was reduced by an average of 4.5% after dehydration. After 180 min of rehydration, plasma volume restoration during Na-R was to 174% of that lost, and during H2O-R it was to 78% of that lost. We found significant correlations between the change in plasma volume and PRA (r = -0.70, P less than 0.001) and between PRA and PA (r = 0.71, P less than 0.001). In both recovery conditions, PRA increased significantly after dehydration (P less than 0.05) and decreased almost to the control level by 180 min of rehydration, at which time the plasma volume deficit was restored. The change in PA paralleled that in PRA. The rate of sodium excretion was correlated with PA levels in both groups (r = -0.58, P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Salmonella enteritidis endotoxin (2 and 20 mg/kg) acutely increased both plasma reduced glutathione and GSSG with a rise in the ratio of GSSG to total glutathione. This increase in GSSG was enhanced by pretreatment with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)1-nitrosourea (BCNU), an inhibitor of the glutathione reductase enzyme. However, there was no significant arteriovenous difference in plasma GSSG across the lung, and lung tissue GSSG did not increase after endotoxin treatment. The increase in plasma GSSG was not blocked by vinblastine-induced neutropenia and could not be reproduced by incubating rat blood in vitro with endotoxin. Receptor antagonists of platelet-activating factor (PAF), at a dose that previously inhibited endotoxin-induced lung injury, attenuated the endotoxin-induced increase in plasma GSSG. We conclude that endotoxin causes neutrophil-independent oxidative stress in rats, which may be enhanced by the action of platelet-activating factor.\r"

The pressure signal observed invariably exhibits two distinct phases. The first phase is a very rapid jump, designated delta Pinit, which occurs immediately on interruption of flow. The second phase is designated delta Pdif and is a further pressure change in the same direction as delta Pinit but evolving over several seconds. The physiological interpretations of delta Pinit and delta Pdif have been somewhat unclear. Delta Pinit has been taken to equal the pressure drop across the pulmonary airways, possibly with a contribution from the tissues of the respiratory system. Delta Pdif can arise, in principle, from two sources: gas redistribution throughout the lung after interruption of flow and stress recovery within the tissues. To resolve these issues we performed interruption experiments on anesthetized paralyzed, tracheotomized, open-chest normal dogs during passive expiration while measuring alveolar pressures at three sites with alveolar capsules. We found that, in the absence of the chest wall, delta Pinit reflects only the resistance of the airways and that delta Pdif can be ascribed almost entirely to the stress recovery properties of lung tissues.\r"

This exercise consisted of alternative opening and closing of both hands at a frequency of approximately 1/s for a duration of 3 min. This exercise was performed twice by each subject. Forearm blood flow (FBF) by plethysmography increased from 2.64 +/- 0.49 (rest) to 31.11 +/- 9.95 ml.100 ml-1.min-1 (immediately after exercise) (P less than 0.001). No statistically significant postexercise increase was observed in LDF measured on the dorsal (110 +/- 21 to 105 +/- 21 mV) or ventral surface (266 +/- 113 to 246 +/- 77 mV) of the forearm. LDF measured from the chest also showed no significant change, indicating that the exercise was too mild to have reflex effects on SkBF. Moreover, the slope of the logarithmic linear regression and the half-time for recovery during the postexercise period for FBF were not reflected in LDF measurements from any of the three sites. We conclude that LDF measured from the skin surface is not influenced by blood flow to underlying skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Repair of cortical bone was studied in 2.4-millimeter-diameter mid-diaphyseal femoral and tibial defects in young New Zealand White rabbits using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and histomorphometry. The initial source of repair tissue is the marrow. Vessels grow into the defect, accompanied by undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. Woven bone is synthesized initially at the periphery of the defect on pre-existing cortex. Differentiating mesenchymal osteoblasts surround themselves with osteoid in a woven conformation. Once a scaffold has formed, surface osteoblasts align themselves in a regular array on the woven matrix surface and synthesize osteoid in a lamellar conformation. The long axes of the repair vessels, lamellae, and osteocyte lacunae are perpendicular to the long axis of the bone. Polarized-light microscopy showed maintenance of this pattern at six, eight, and twelve weeks, even when the defect was filled with lamellar bone. Remodeling is performed slowly by osteoclast cutting cones over a period of several months. The lacunar-canalicular system is clearly demonstrated in plastic-embedded, toluidine blue-stained sections. A canaliculus passes into or away from a lacuna every 1.9 micrometers over the entire osteocyte perimeter. Undifferentiated mesenchymal cells have no processes, as seen by transmission electron microscopy, but soon sprout a florid array of processes as differentiation to early mesenchymal osteoblasts proceeds. Osteoblast and osteocyte cell processes are packed with intermediate filaments that are continuous with those in the cell bodies. Intercellular gap junctions are seen between surface osteoblasts, between osteoblasts and underlying osteocytes, and between osteocyte cell processes in the canaliculi.\r"

Neither the preoperative existence of necrosis of the proximal fragment nor the location of the fracture affected the results. When there was mild radiocarpal arthritis preoperatively, it did not progress postoperatively; if there was moderate radiocarpal arthritis preoperatively, progression seldom was seen if a radial styloidectomy was done. Displaced and unstable ununited fractures healed even if the deformity was not corrected completely. The principal benefit of the procedure was relief of pain rather than an increase either in motion of the wrist or in strength of grip.\r"

The recognition of nerve compression by a false aneurysm is important, since in these cases, vascular repair alone may not give recovery and neurolysis may be necessary. The overall results of operation were good; lesions of C5 and C6 roots recovered better than those of more distal roots.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the potential role of the parasympathetic nervous system in human glucoregulatory physiology, responses to the muscarinic cholinergic agonist bethanechol (5.0 mg s.c.) and antagonist atropine (1.0 mg i.v.) were measured in normal humans. There were no changes in the plasma glucose concentration or rates of glucose production or utilization following atropine administration. After bethanechol administration there were no changes in the plasma glucose concentration or fluxes despite increments in plasma glucagon (75 +/- 7 to 103 +/- 10 pg/ml, P less than 0.02). There were no changes in insulin or C-peptide levels. To test the hypothesis that direct muscarinic inhibition of glucose production was offset by an indirect action of the agonist, specifically increased glucagon secretion with consequent stimulation of glucose production, bethanechol was administered while glucagon levels were held constant with the islet clamp technique (somatostatin infusion with insulin, glucagon and growth hormone replacement at fixed rates). Under that condition the muscarinic agonist induced a 25% decrement in the plasma glucose concentration (101 +/- 8 to 75 +/- 8 mg/dl, P less than 0.05). When compared with separate clamp control studies (with placebo rather than bethanechol injection) both the rate of glucose production and the glucose concentration were reduced (P less than 0.05) following bethanechol injection; the rate of glucose utilization was unaltered. Thus, we conclude: Withdrawal of parasympathetic tone does not appear to be an important glucoregulatory process in humans. Direct muscarinic cholinergic inhibition of hepatic glucose production occurs in humans but during generalized muscarinic activation this is offset by an indirect muscarinic action, increased glucagon secretion with consequent stimulation of glucose production. Thus, particularly if regional neuronal firing occurs, the parasympathetic nervous system may play an important role in human glucoregulatory physiology.\r"

Several recent studies using cells in primary culture suggest that hepatocytes are the source of much of the collagen in normal rat liver. In view of other data indicating that lipocytes produce substantial amounts of this protein, we have reexamined collagen biosynthesis in hepatocyte cultures that have been carefully characterized with respect to the presence of lipocytes. We find that routinely prepared hepatocyte isolates contain, by number, approximately 10% lipocytes. Lipocytes in early culture are difficult to visualize by phase-contrast microscopy but after 4 d proliferate and eventually replace the parenchymal cells. The size of the lipocyte subpopulation in these cultures correlates positively with collagen production. Similarly, removal of lipocytes by further processing of the initial hepatocyte isolate significantly reduces collagen production. Moreover, the only cells within hepatocyte cultures that display type I collagen by immunohistochemistry are lipocytes. We conclude that lipocytes are the principal source of collagen in primary hepatocyte cultures. The findings indicate also that these cells are the previously described \"fibroblast\" that appear in relatively long-term hepatocyte cultures.\r"

In both models an early (2-4 d) and transient expression of three major stress proteins (heat shock protein [HSP] HSP 70, HSP 68, and HSP 58) was observed together with an increased synthesis of putative ribosomal proteins. Only traces of 35S-labeled HSPs were detected in controls and sham-operated animals. The three stress proteins were identified by their migration in two-dimensional gels, by comigration with HSPs, which had been induced in myocytes by incubation at 41 degrees C and immunoblot analysis using antisera directed against the 70-kD protein. Immunohistochemical staining of HSP 70 in rod-shaped myocytes and detection by immunoblot showed that HSP 70 was equally present and distributed in both sham-operated and overloaded hearts, and provided no evidence for a subpopulation of myocytes acutely involved in the increased expression of HSP 70. It is suggested that the transient expression of HSPs that occurs during the early adaptation of the myocardial cells to overload could confer some degree of protection to the actively growing myocytes.\r"

Measurement of cAMP, cGMP, and free cytosolic Ca2+ in response to STa suggested that cGMP alone mediated the Cl- secretory response. Studies utilizing blockers of the Na+,K+-ATPase pump, a Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport system, a K+ channel, and a Cl- channel suggest that all of them participate in the Cl- secretory process induced by STa. The results suggest that the Cl- secretory response induced by STa is mediated by cGMP after the enterotoxin binds to its receptor on the apical membrane. The enterotoxin, by increasing cGMP, opens a K+ channel on the basolateral membrane as well as a Cl- channel on the apical membrane. The activation of these ion exit mechanisms, together with activations of the Na+,K+,Cl- cotransporter and the Na+,K+-ATPase pump drives Cl- exit through the Cl- channel on the apical membrane.\r"

Immunoreactive CGRP was recognized in rat renal cortical nerve fibers, and intact rat CGRP was identified in extracts of the rat renal cortex. Because CGRP containing sensory nerve fibers are seen in the region of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, it would seem that the release of CGRP from these afferent nerves may be involved in the physiological control of renin secretion.\r"

We have studied the mechanism of CEA membrane attachment and release using the human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line LS-174T, specimens of human colon cancers, and serum from colon cancer patients. CEA release by cells in vitro and in vivo is associated with the conversion of CEA from a membrane-bound, hydrophobic molecule to a soluble, hydrophilic form with no apparent decrease in molecular mass. When LS-174T cell membranes were incubated with various buffers, proteases, and phospholipases, the only agents that released CEA and converted it to the hydrophilic form were preparations of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Both [3H]ethanolamine and [3H]palmitate could be incorporated metabolically into CEA but only palmitate was released by treatment with PI-PLC, consistent with the presence of a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. PI-PLC treatment also release significant quantities of CEA from living monolayers and from seven human colon cancer specimens. These experiments suggest that cellular CEA is anchored to membranes by a covalent linkage to a membrane phosphatidylinositol molecule, and that an endogenous phospholipase may be important for releasing CEA in vitro and in vivo.\r"

The current study showed that membrane surface p150,95 also expressed iC3b-receptor activity and was probably the same as the neutrophil receptor for iC3b- or C3dg-coated erythrocytes (EC3bi or EC3dg) that had been previously designated CR4. Normal neutrophil and macrophage CR4-dependent EC3bi rosettes were inhibited by monoclonal anti-p150,95, and cells from a patient with CD18 deficiency did not form CR4-dependent EC3bi rosettes. With neutrophils that bore large amounts of CR1 and CR3 and little p150,95, EC3bi were found primarily via CR1 and CR3, and demonstration of p150,95-dependent rosettes required large amounts of fixed iC3b, low-ionic strength buffer, and antibody blockade of CR1 and CR3. By contrast, culture-derived macrophages expressed eight times more p150,95 than did monocytes and EC3bi were bound to both p150,95 and CR3 when EC3bi bore small amounts of fixed iC3b and assays were carried out in isotonic buffer. Comparison of the amounts of CR1, CR3, and CR4 in various tissues by immunoperoxidase staining revealed that CR4 was the most abundant C3 receptor molecule on tissue macrophages, and suggested that CR4 might be involved in clearance of C3-opsonized particles or immune complexes.\r"

  ".U": "88299181\r", 
  ".W": "The various physiological processes that constitute liver function are compartmentalized within the hepatic acinus. The molecular mechanisms modulating the development and maintenance of this hepatocyte heterogeneity have not been defined. The objective of this study was to determine whether transcriptional or posttranscriptional zonal modulation of cytochromes P-450b,e gene expression was responsible for the heterogeneous induction of the P-450 proteins, which is observed after phenobarbital (PB) administration. The exact localization in liver tissue of hepatocytes responding to PB with induction of either P-450b,e mRNA or proteins was established by in situ hybridization and by immunofluorescence, respectively. As demonstrated by quantitative assessment of autoradiographs of approximately 20 hepatocytes located between a terminal portal venule and a hepatic venule, PB induced the P-450b,e mRNA up to sixfold in the 12-15 hepatocytes located closer to the hepatic venules (zones 2 and 3). In contrast, there was only a twofold induction in the 4-6 hepatocytes surrounding the terminal portal venules (zone 1). Quantitative immunofluorescence using an MAb showed that the acinar distribution of PB-induced P-450b,e proteins was similar to that of the mRNA. This combined approach indicated that, most likely, an increased rate of transcription of cytochromes P-450b,e genes in hepatocytes of zones 2 and 3 concomitantly, with a relative lack of activation, or repression, of these genes in hepatocytes of zone 1, were responsible for the heterogeneous phenotype observed after PB administration. Therefore, modulation of gene expression among hepatocytes of the liver acinus is one mechanism by which the functional heterogeneity of hepatocytes is attained. Experiments in which the induction of cytochromes P-450b,e genes was studied after administration of either PB or para-hydroxyphenobarbital, a main hepatic metabolite of PB, suggested that the species involved in the inductive process is the parent PB molecule rather than para-hydroxyphenobarbital.\r"

In some of these patients, xanthomas also develop and provide cutaneous markers for the lipoprotein disorder. As advances in molecular biology refine our understanding of lipoprotein metabolism, it has become increasingly clear that several types of xanthomas are associated with specific disease states. This article presents a differential diagnosis of xanthomas that incorporates contemporary thinking about lipoprotein disorders and focuses on the relationship between abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism, content, or structure and the development of specific xanthomas.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and urokinase on patency and early reocclusion of infarct-related coronary arteries were investigated in a single blind, randomized multicenter trial in 246 patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than 6 h duration. Both 70 mg of single chain rt-PA with an initial bolus of 10 mg and 3 million units of urokinase with an initial bolus of 1.5 million units were given intravenously over 90 min. The first angiographic study at the end of the infusion revealed a patent infarct-related artery (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial [TIMI] grade 2 or 3) in 69.4% of 121 patients given rt-PA versus 65.8% of 117 patients given urokinase (p = NS). Among patients treated within 3 h from symptom onset a patent infarct-related artery was found in 63.9% of 72 patients given rt-PA versus 70% of 70 patients given urokinase (p = NS). There were five cardiac deaths in each group and one fatal intracranial hemorrhage in the rt-PA group. The in-hospital reinfarction rate was 8.9% versus 13.2% for patients treated with rt-PA and urokinase, respectively. There was no difference in left ventricular function at baseline and follow-up catheterization studies. Both drugs were well tolerated and there was no significant difference in cardiovascular or bleeding complications between the two groups. It is concluded that rt-PA and urokinase in the dosages used provide similar efficacy and safety in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Reocclusion during the first 24 h may be less frequent after urokinase treatment.\r"

  ".W": "This article reviews what is known of endothelium-derived relaxing factor and its possible physiologic and pathophysiologic roles. This relaxing factor is now thought to be nitric oxide or a ready source of it. It acts as an endogenous nitrovasodilator, stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase to increase cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) levels in vascular smooth muscle and platelets, with consequent relaxant and anti-aggregatory effects (predominantly when stimulated through receptor-operated channels). Its actions are thus synergistic with those of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-mediated stimulation (for example, adenosine, prostacyclin). Endothelium-derived relaxing factor is unstable and is thought to act only very locally in vivo. Its release is continuous in the basal state and is stimulated by a number of neuropeptides and by agents released during platelet activation and thrombosis--with large differences in activity among different vessels. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor activity is also flow related, thereby coordinating vasomotor behavior in an intact vascular tree in response to changes in flow. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor activity is reduced in several pathologic states, including atherosclerosis.\r"

BAL was tolerated well by all patients with only one patient experiencing mild wheezing. BAL fluid recovery averaged 40%, and total cells/lavage were 22.3 x 10(6) (range 3.5 to 49.5 x 10(6)). Cell viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, averaged 48% (range 34% to 60%). Mean values for cellular elements were macrophages, 62%; epithelial cells, 12%; lymphocytes, 16%; neutrophils (PMN), 4%; and eosinophils, 6%. Isotypic antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) in BAL and serum were detected by an amplified indirect ELISA. Antibodies to Af in BAL expressed as optical density/albumin (milligrams per milliliter) were compared to BAL from six nonatopic patients. IgE-Af and IgA-Af in BAL were elevated in patients with ABPA compared with six nonatopic patients. The ratios of Ig-Af in BAL to peripheral blood in patients with ABPA were 48 (range 18 to 75) for IgE-Af, 96 (range 37 to 159) for IgA-Af, and 0.94 (range 0.24 to 1.40) for IgG-Af, suggesting local production of IgE-Af and IgA-Af in the bronchoalveolar compartment. Total serum IgE correlated directly with IgE-Af in BAL (rs = 0.67; p less than 0.02). However, the ratio of total BAL IgE/albumin divided by total serum IgE/albumin was 0.93 +/- 0.94, suggesting that the bronchoalveolar compartment is not the source of the significant elevations in total serum IgE in ABPA.\r"

Four subjects had clinical features of hypersensitivity pneumonitis after exposure to moldy hay. The other three subjects had no clinical disease in spite of similar exposure. Although serum precipitins were found in most subjects, a biotin-avidin-linked immunosorbent assay revealed high levels of F. rectivirgula-specific antibodies only in the symptomatic subjects. In addition, numerous precipitin arcs were present in the sera of the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic subjects by antigen-antibody crossed immunoelectrophoresis. No clear distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects could be made on the basis of lymphocyte phenotype studies, and antigen-induced lymphocyte transformation was not detected in any subjects. The results indicate that F. rectivirgula-specific antibody levels as detected by biotin-avidin-linked immunosorbent assay and by the presence of precipitin arcs in crossed immunoelectrophoresis may differentiate symptomatic and asymptomatic farmers.\r"

  ".U": "88299434\r", 
  ".W": "A 43-year-old woman developed asthma 6 years after beginning work in a food-processing plant in which soybean flour was used as a protein extender. Symptoms of sneezing, coughing, and wheezing would begin within minutes of exposure to soybean flour and resolve 2 hours after exposure ceased. Skin tests were positive to a soy extract prepared from the flour. Airway hyperreactivity was confirmed by a positive bronchial challenge to methacholine. Bronchial challenge with soybean flour produced an immediate increase in specific airway resistance from 5.0 to 22.7 L. cm of H2O/L/sec. There was no response to challenge with lactose. The patient's allergic response to soy-flour extract was further characterized by several immunologic methods. IgE binding to soy-flour protein by direct RAST was 5.98 times that of a normal control serum. The soy-flour extract was separated by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Twenty-four protein bands were detected in the crude soy-flour extract. After immunoblotting and subsequent autoradiography, nine proteins with molecular weights ranging from 54,500 to 14,875 were found. Cross-reactivity studies with other legumes demonstrated apparent immunologic identity between a component in green pea extract and a soybean protein with a molecular weight of 17,000. The clinical significance of this cross-reactivity is not known. We conclude that in this case of occupational asthma to soybean flour, multiple allergens were involved. Immunoblotting may be useful in identifying the allergens involved in occupational asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Dermal blood flow was evaluated after skin prick test with histamine and allergen in six patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Blood flow was registered continuously for 60 minutes after the test procedure with laser doppler flowmetry, which allows noninvasive measurements. Blood flow was measured close to the skin test in the wheal obtained, and at a greater distance from the prick in the flare reaction. Tests were performed with preloaded skin test needles with histamine and the appropriate allergen freeze-dried on the point of the lancet, as well as with the appropriate negative control. The prick test procedure, by itself, induced a transient increase in blood flow that was normalized again after 9 minutes for the closest measurement. Histamine induced a rapid increase in blood flow in both the flare and wheal reaction that was normalized after about 45 minutes. The increase was significantly higher in the flare compared to the wheal for the time points from 6 1/2 to 13 minutes. Allergen induced a similar increase in blood flow. However, the increase was not noticeable until 2 1/2 minutes after the allergen application and was not completely abolished within 60 minutes. Furthermore, the difference between the flare and wheal reaction, with the higher values for the flare reaction, was present for a longer period of time than for the equivalent histamine measurements. In conclusion, laser doppler flowmetry appears useful for continuous evaluation of vascular changes induced at skin prick tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Naloxone produced mild behavioral effects with slight cognitive impairment after the 2.0 mg/kg dose only. The threshold, dose dependency, characteristics, and magnitude of these behavioral effects were similar to what has previously been reported in young normal subjects, but markedly different from those observed in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) matched in age to the current study sample. These data suggest that the metabolic fate of naloxone is not substantially affected by age within the range studied. The findings of this study provide further support for a role for endogenous opiate systems in the modulation of behavior and cognition, and suggest that the unusual behavioral sensitivity of patients with DAT to naloxone cannot be accounted for by the effect of age.\r"

  ".W": "Until now, no self-rated depression scale had been validated as a screening measure for major depression in the older patient hospitalized with medical illness. The present report establishes the validity of two brief, easily administered depression screening tests, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Brief Carroll Depression Rating Scale (BCDRS), in this population. Structured psychiatric interviews were performed and self-rated depression measures administered to 128 men, aged 70 and over, consecutively admitted to medical and neurological services of a VA hospital. The GDS and BCDRS were both shown to have high sensitivity and specificity for detecting major depression in this setting. Optimal cut-off scores determined by the receiver operating curve characteristics of these tests were 11 for the GDS and 6 for the BCDRS. At a cutoff score of 11, the GDS had a sensitivity of 92%, a specificity of 89%, and a negative predictive value of 99%; lowering the break point to 8 did not increase sensitivity. At a cutoff score of 6, the BCDRS achieved a 100% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and 100% negative predictive value. Whether clinicians decide to implement either of these depression screens in their practice will depend to a large degree on the importance ascribed to the detection of these disorders and on attitudes toward the benefits of treatment.\r"

We have conducted a retrospective study during a 12-month period analyzing the clinical correlates of bacteremia in 533 chronically institutionalized, predominantly male patients, with an average age of 69 years. Thirty-four men had forty-two bacteremic illnesses during this period. The incidence rate was 0.30 episodes per 1000 patient care days, and the mortality rate was 21%. The urinary tract was the most frequently identified tissue source (56%), followed by respiratory tract (7%) and skin (7%). Providencia stuartii was the most common gram-negative organism, while Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus were the frequent gram-positive microbes. Gram-negative bacteremia accounted for 63% of the episodes (15% mortality rate), and gram-positive bacteremia accounted for 27% (18% mortality rate); 10% of the bacteremias were polymicrobial (25% mortality rate). Most of the isolated organisms were sensitive to available antimicrobial agents. The leading risk factor for bacteremia was an indwelling urinary catheter (odds ratio 39, 95% confidence limits 16 to 97). Patients with urinary catheters at the beginning of the study constituted only 5% of the population, but accounted for 40% of the gram-negative bacteremias during the year of observation.\r"

Comparing nursing home mortality data for 1982 and 1985, we found a 16.6% increase in overall nursing home mortality rates. The increased mortality rates occurred in the sample SNFs regardless of ownership, Medicare certification, bed size, metropolitan area and hospital affiliation. There were two explanations for the increased mortality rates. First, the number of residents dying within 30 days after nursing home admission increased 59%. The majority of these short-lived residents had been discharged from hospitals indicating a transfer of terminally ill patients into nursing homes just prior to death. Second, there was a 27% increase in the mortality rate of residents living in the nursing home for 1 to 5 years suggesting that the population had become sicker between 1982 and 1985. These data reflect both the impact of Medicares Prospective Payment System (PPS) on the study nursing homes and an increase in the severity of illness of Wisconsin's nursing home population between 1982 and 1985. The findings document an increased role for nursing homes in caring for more acutely ill patients since the passage of the PPS, and have implications for nursing home reimbursement policies and quality of care.\r"

The protective activity of postimmunization serum resided solely in IgM antibody, whereas IgG antibody exhibited no protective activity. IgM antibody to the Re mutant was protective against bacterial challenge with both test strains of bacteria and S. typhi LPS. IgM antibody, at approximately the same concentration present in postimmunization serum, increased the LD50 of K. pneumoniae from less than 8.0 x 10(2) to greater than 2.0 x 10(4).

Febrile reactions, usually mild, occurred after 7% of injections with the highest doses (2.0 and 3.0 x 10(10) organisms), and mild local soreness and tenderness were noted after approximately one-third of injections. Passive immunization of mice with sera from immunized subjects demonstrated that protective activity against challenge with both heterologous, viable gram-negative bacilli and endotoxin developed. Although measuring serum protective activity, developing a serological assay that correlates with protective activity, and potential vaccine toxicity remain problems, immunization of humans with the Re mutant results in serum protective activity against endotoxin and viable bacilli and has the potential for clinical usefulness.\r"

Patients were 18 mo to 42 y of age (geometric mean, 10.2 y), and the 19 patients in each group were comparable on admission. All patients received intravenous quinine therapy. Four patients (21%) in each group died. There were no significant differences between the placebo- and dexamethasone-treated groups in time until patients became afebrile (median, 51 vs. 19 h), the level of consciousness became normal (mean, 80 vs. 83 h), or parasitemia was cleared (mean, 2.1 vs. 3.4 d) or in the incidence of complications. Coma or hyperparasitemia (greater than or equal to 5% of erythrocytes parasitized) at the time of admission and hypoglycemia at any time during hospitalization were significantly correlated with a fatal outcome, which was not improved by using dexamethasone. We conclude that high-dose dexamethasone is not indicated for treating cerebral malaria.\r"

Rabbits with combined tricuspid and aortic endocarditis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa received single intravenous doses of either ceftazidime (50 mg/kg) or amikacin (15 or 40 mg/kg). For each antibiotic regimen, areas under the time-concentration curves and percent vegetation penetrances were significantly greater for tricuspid than aortic vegetations (P less than .001). Time-concentration curves for aortic vegetations paralleled those for plasma; curves for the tricuspid vegetations resembled those for subcutaneous fibrin clots. The times above the minimum bactericidal concentration for tricuspid vegetations were significantly longer than those achieved within aortic vegetations for ceftazidime (P less than .01) and amikacin at 15 mg/kg (P less than .001). Antimicrobial pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may be more favorable within tricuspid than aortic vegetations; this difference may, in part, explain more salutary outcomes in bacterial endocarditis involving the right side of the heart.\r"

The 24,770 persons who ingested two or more doses of BS-WC vaccine were compared with 24,842 controls who took two or more doses of killed whole-cell (WC) oral cholera vaccine. Sixty-seven percent fewer episodes of LT-ETEC diarrhea were noted in the BS-WC group than in the WC group during short-term (three-month) follow-up (P less than .01), but no reduction was evident during the ensuing nine months. Short-term protection was particularly notable against LT-ETEC diarrhea causing life-threatening dehydration (protective efficacy, 86%; P less than .05).\r"

Chitotriose, N-acetylglucosamine, D-mannose, alpha-methyl-mannoside, and L-fucose, but not D-galactose, were effective inhibitors of conidial binding. This pattern of reduction of conidial binding was consistent with that for the mannosylfucosyl receptor. In addition, conidial binding may be mediated by another lectin on the macrophage membrane, one that recognizes chitin components, because N-acetylglucosamine and chitotriose exhibited greater inhibition than expected for the mannosyl-fucosyl lectin.\r"

The ELISA was rapid, simple to perform, and able to detect less than 10 ng of antigen/mL of serum. The model was also used to evaluate the effect of temporary and persistent immunosuppression on experimental disease. Antigen levels rose progressively in untreated control rabbits; all 15 animals had significant antigenemia. Treated animals had markedly reduced antigen levels, but nine of 13 rabbits had detectable antigen after 72 h of therapy, a result that correlated with persistent disease. Therapy begun 24 h after challenge in temporarily immunosuppressed animals was more likely to sterilize tissues than was therapy begun 48 h after challenge. Therapy in persistently immunosuppressed rabbits was less effective and may require improved antifungal regimens to be successful.\r"

In immunologically normal patients, virus was detected in five of nine who died five days or less after the onset of rash but in none of 11 who died later. Virus was localized to epithelial cells of lung, gut, bile duct, bladder, and skin and to lymphoid organs. Neither viral antigen nor RNA was detected in brain sections from 14 patients, including seven with acute encephalomyelitis and four with virus identified in other tissues, a finding supporting an indirect pathogenesis of post-measles encephalomyelitis. These data show that measles virus replicates in cells previously not recognized to be involved (capillary endothelium of lymph node and thymus, Hassall's corpuscles, and hepatic duct epithelium) and that invasion of the brain parenchyma during acute measles is uncommon.\r"

Gardnerella vaginalis, once thought to be the sole etiologic agent, is probably one of several endogenous members of the vaginal flora that overgrow in women with bacterial vaginosis. Whether the growth of anaerobes or a primary decrease in lactobacilli is the initial pathogenic event remains unclear. Epidemiological studies have revealed that current or previous infections caused by Trichomonas organisms, increased sexual activity, and intrauterine device use are risk factors for this condition. Studies have indicated that bacterial vaginosis, previously thought to be a benign illness, is associated with some morbidity in pregnant women. Symptoms remain unreliable in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Diagnostic efficacy is best achieved by utilizing clinical signs. Assessment of cure is best accomplished by Gram stain, not clinical criteria. Metronidazole, 500 mg orally for seven days, remains the treatment of choice; however, a 2-g single dose of metronidazole represents a reasonable alternative if cost and compliance issues predominate in a clinical situation. Although a recent study supports the contention that treatment of the male sexual partner of women with bacterial vaginosis is effective, a general recommendation cannot be made with confidence on the issue of sexual partner treatment until other supporting work is done.\r"

It is mainly composed of structurally altered neurofilament, and occurs wherever there is excessive loss of neurons. It occurs in some elderly individuals and rarely in other degenerative diseases of the central nervous system. In 273 brains of patients dying from disorders other than Parkinson's disease, the age-specific prevalence of Lewy bodies increased from 3.8% to 12.8% between the sixth and ninth decades. Associated pathological findings suggest that these cases of incidental Lewy body disease are presymptomatic cases of Parkinson's disease, and confirm the importance of age (time) in the evolution of the disease. In view of the common and widespread occurrence of this disorder we propose that endogenous mechanisms operating in early life may be more important than environmental agents in the pathogenesis of Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a simple in vitro method for the semiquantitative assessment of the radiolabeled antibody binding to cancer and normal tissues. Indium-111-labeled F(ab')2 fragments of 17-1A and 19-9 monoclonal antibodies with well-characterized specificity for gastrointestinal cancer demonstrated similar binding properties between cultured cancer cells and membrane fractions of homogenates prepared from tumor tissues. All of the 17 colon cancer specimens and seven (64%) of 11 gastric cancer specimens obtained by surgery showed positive binding with 17-1A. Specific binding of 19-9 was observed in 9 (53%) colon cancers and 4 (36%) gastric cancers. However, some normal colon tissues were also positive with 111In-labeled 17-1A. Relative levels of CA 19-9 antigen expression, determined by the binding with radiolabeled antibodies, correlated with percent positive cells determined by the immunohistochemical assays. Furthermore, membrane fractions could be cryopreserved without losing antibody-binding activity. These results indicate that this assay can be used for testing the immunoreactivity of radiolabeled anti-tumor antibodies and in vitro binding properties to cancer and normal tissues.\r"

  ".U": "88300262\r", 
  ".W": "The cafeteria diet involves feeding experimental animals a choice of palatable human food items to stimulate energy intake, and has been used extensively to study diet-induced thermogenesis. In a recent commentary Moore has argued that this feeding regime is inappropriate for such studies because the nutrient composition cannot be controlled, many of the effects seen are due to protein or nutrient deficiency and accurate measurements of energy intake are difficult to achieve. We argue that all of these criticisms can be overcome by careful use of the feeding regime and well-controlled experiments. Gross nutrient composition of cafeteria diets can be modified over a wide range, and such studies demonstrate that the effects of protein deficiency can be clearly dissociated from those of hyperphagia. There is no experimental evidence for nutritional deficiency in cafeteria-fed animals even over very long periods of time. Furthermore, the alternatives suggested by Moore, i.e., presenting sucrose solutions to drink or high fat diets, suffer the same drawbacks of altered and often uncontrolled nutrient intake and yet produce little or no increase in energy intake. Criticism of the cafeteria diet is not justified simply because of its misuse by nutritionally naive experimenters. The value and validity of this feeding regime is further supported by the enormous impact it has made on our understanding of energy balance regulation and thermogenesis.\r"

Seventy-four patients, 65 years old or older, who were followed at a university hospital medical clinic were randomly allocated to an intervention or a control group. The intervention was a detailed discussion with the patient's physician of the patient's wishes about decision making and life support therapy in the event of extreme or incapacitating illness. A blinded interviewer then asked all consenting patients how they felt about the physician, the clinic visit, and their medical care. Intervention-group patients were questioned about their reactions to the physician and the discussion. Four important findings emerged: 1) Some emotional uncertainty was created when doctors raised these questions unexpectedly: one patient became visibly upset during the discussion, and three who gave consent to be interviewed afterward said that the discussion had made them wonder about their health. Nonetheless, all patients who received the intervention and completed the study were pleased that their doctor had asked. 2) Only 44% of all consenting patients reported having discussed these issues previously; only one had done so with a doctor. 3) 97% of patients who responded wanted to be kept informed by the doctor about their medical situations in times of serious illness. 4) Patients' replies to specific questions about life-sustaining therapy in the event of their own severe illnesses were quite variable. During routine clinic visits doctors can encourage most elderly patients to begin specific planning for potential severe illnesses.\r"

  ".W": "Rabbit antibodies were generated against five unique epitopes of phencyclidine (PCP)-like molecules to determine the molecular requirements for arylcyclohexylamine binding to the PCP receptor. Three of the haptens contained the three ring structures of PCP. A fourth hapten was synthesized from a derivative of the highly potent PCP analog, 1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine. The fifth hapten, 5-[N-(1'-phenylcyclohexyl)amino]pentanoic acid, was used as a haptenic model for N-ethyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine, one of the most potent arylcyclohexylamines. These haptens were bound covalently to bovine serum albumin and were then used as antigens to immunize rabbits. The affinities and cross-reactivity patterns of the resulting five antibodies were studied in a [3H]PCP radioimmunoassay using standard curves of various arylcyclohexylamines. The dissociation constants ranged from 1.9 to 51.6 nM. From the average IC50 values of the radioimmunoassay dose-response curves, the relative potency of each ligand to PCP was determined. Least-squares linear regression was used to correlate these data with relative potency data from two [3H]PCP receptor binding assays and a PCP drug discrimination assay in the rat. Only relative potency data from the anti-5[N-(1'-phenylcyclohexyl)amino]pentanoic acid antibody showed a significant correlation with data from the three pharmacological studies (r2 = 0.80, 0.57 and 0.78, respectively; p less than .05 in all cases). These data indicated the 5-[N-(1'-phenylcyclohexyl)amino]pentanoic acid hapten contained the pharmacologically active features needed for arylcyclohexylamine binding to the PCP receptor.\r"

The selective loss of the tail-flick reflex was investigated using electrophysiologic methods and a dose of dynorphin effective in 90% of the rats. These studies revealed that intrathecal administration of dynorphin resulted in loss of the C-fiber initiated reflex when assayed 1 to 30 days after injection. On the other hand, reflexes initiated by Group I and III afferents were not obviously different from those seen in saline-injected animals. Application of dynorphin in situ on to the cord during stimulation of the dorsal root and recording of ventral root potentials demonstrated a rapid onset of peptide action. Initially the C-fiber evoked reflex was potentiated selectively with a decrease in conduction time. These responses were followed by inhibition of all reflexes for a short period of time after which the reflexes initiated by Group I and III afferents reappeared whereas the C-fiber reflex did not recover. This time course paralleled closely the time course of the loss of the tail-flick reflex suggesting that the two effects may be causally related. Furthermore, the selective N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate applied directly to the spinal cord during recording resulted in a reversible inhibition of the C-fiber-initiated reflex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Results from studies utilizing intrathecal administration of adenosine or adenosine analogs, in particular, suggest that endogenous adenosine may inhibit the transmission of nociceptive impulses at spinal sites. The present investigations were performed to extend our understanding of the role of adenosine in antinociception by examining the effect of adenosine agonists on behavior induced by two putative spinal nociceptive neurotransmitters, substance P and N-methyl-D-aspartate. Coadministration of each of several adenosine agonists with substance P or N-methyl-D-aspartate intrathecally significantly decreased the intensity of behaviors induced by putative nociceptive neurotransmitters in mice. Adenosine agonist-mediated inhibition was antagonized by theophylline supporting adenosine agonist interactions with cell membrane surface adenosine receptors. Rank order potencies were determined for several adenosine analogs with varying selectivity for A1 and A2 adenosine receptor subtypes. However, rank order potencies did not correlate well with rank order potencies reported previously for adenosine receptor subtypes in biochemical assays. The results of these investigations demonstrate that adenosine inhibits behavior induced by nociceptive neurotransmitters interacting with spinal substance P or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Furthermore, observations provide additional support for endogenous antinociceptive pathways that utilize adenosine at spinal sites.\r"

Treatment with yohimbine (10(-9) and 10(-8) M) potentiated the response to nerve stimulation dose-dependently in the dog arteries, but rather attenuated the response of the primate arteries. Yohimbine (10(-8) M) attenuated the contraction caused by exogenous norepinephrine in the dog and monkey arteries. Angiotensin (ANG) II (2 X 10(-10) M) and ANG I (10(-9) M) potentiated the response to transmural stimulation in the dog and monkey arteries, whereas the response to norepinephrine was unaffected. The ANG I-induced potentiation was suppressed by treatment with ANG converting enzyme inhibitors. 3H-Overflow evoked by transmural stimulation in tissues prelabeled with [3H] norepinephrine was increased by yohimbine in the superfused dog arteries but was not increased significantly in the monkey arteries. The overflow was increased significantly by ANG II in the dog and monkey arteries. It may be concluded that prejunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors mediating the inhibition of transmitter release do not function significantly in human gastroepiploic and monkey mesenteric arteries, and postjunctional alpha-2 receptors are involved partly in contractions of the monkey arteries due to adrenergic nerve stimulation. ANG II appears to be synthesized from ANG I via ANG converting enzyme in the primate arteries; the octapeptide potentiates the contraction caused by adrenergic nerve stimulation, possibly due to prejunctional ANG receptor activation and increased norepinephrine release.\r"

Diclofenac significantly increased (P less than .05) the area under the curve in tissue-cage fluid of ceftriaxone and cefotiam-treated animals, and the terminal half-life of ceftriaxone in their sera (3.45 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.5 hr). Diclofenac reduced urinary excretion of cefotiam only. Cefmenoxime pharmacokinetics remained unchanged by diclofenac. The alteration of ceftriaxone kinetics appeared to be due to nonrenal mechanisms and could suggest reduction of biliary excretion. In Escherichia coli endocarditis, diclofenac enhanced the concentration (P less than .05) of cefotiam (23 +/- 16 vs. 8.9 +/- 5 micrograms/g) and ceftriaxone (13.2 +/- 3 vs. 8.5 +/- 4 micrograms/g) in infected vegetations, but not that of cefmenoxime. The antibacterial effect of ceftriaxone increased with diclofenac (5.5 +/- 1 vs. 7.2 +/- 1 log10 colony forming unit/g of vegetation). In vitro, neither protein binding to rabbit serum proteins nor intrinsic activity on the E. coli strain of each antibiotic was modified by diclofenac. These results suggest that anti-inflammatory drugs could increase antibiotic efficacy by altering their pharmacokinetics. The renal and nonrenal site of interaction may be involved for drugs belonging to the same class. Results obtained in tissue-cage fluid were predictive of the interference at the infected site.\r"

  ".W": "125I-Tyr8-substance P binding was examined in a plasma membrane enriched fraction from the circular muscle of canine small intestine. The binding was quick in onset, reversible and saturable to a single high affinity binding site; KD and maximum receptor concentration were 0.50 = 0.06 nM and 742 +/- 173 fmol/mg of protein, respectively. KD values from kinetic and saturation studies were in agreement. The rank order of potency of the tachykinins and related compounds in displacing this binding was consistent with that of a neurokinin (NK)-P (NK-1) type binding site. 125I-eledoisin did not bind specifically to these membranes and eledoisin was relatively ineffective in displacing the 125I-Tyr8 substance P. Kassinin was totally ineffective. Based on relative agonist potencies, the tachykinins appeared to contract the circular muscle of canine small intestine in vitro by a mechanism which also could be considered to be a NK-P (NK-1) type receptor. However, a comparison of data obtained by these two techniques suggests that the NK-P (NK-1) type binding site and the receptor(s) responsible for contractile responses are not identical. There were discrepancies in relative orders of potency and in absolute potencies. The simplest explanation is that there is also an NK-A (NK-2) receptor which is functional but not labeled by our ligands. Possible reasons for these discrepancies are discussed.\r"

Similarities and differences were noted in the EEG dose-response curves. At lower doses of PCP and its analogs, low-amplitude theta waves predominated; however, at higher doses, high-amplitude, lower-frequency waves predominated. Qualitatively, the N-piperidine derivatives were similar to PCP and differed primarily in potency. The benzomorphan (+/-)-SKF 10047 produced only theta activity at doses up to 12.8 mg/kg. These EEG effects occurred in conjunction with overt behaviors including locomotion, stereotypy and ataxia, concurrently assessed via observer-based rating scales. A strong correlation (r = 0.98) was obtained between the EEG and behavioral effects and the IC50 values from [3H]PCP displacement experiments using crude rat brain homogenates.\r"

As a specialty established less than 20 years ago, family practice has successfully surmounted several obstacles to achieve recognition within the medical community and among the public. However, the Council has identified new challenges and opportunities facing this specialty. In particular, the areas of graduate medical education, reimbursement, professional liability, and several health-related societal and ethical issues will pose challenges for and place constraints on family physicians. Family practice will encounter a number of opportunities in the evolving environment of medicine, due in part to demographic trends in the population and the growth in managed care.

  ".W": "Insulin secretion may be impaired in chronic renal failure (CRF) and available data suggest that this abnormality may be related to the state of secondary hyperparathyroidism of renal failure. We directly measured insulin release from isolated islets of Langerhans obtained from normal rats, CRF-control and CRF-PTX (parathyroidectomized) rats, and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-treated animals. Both early and total glucose-induced insulin release from islets of CRF-control were markedly and significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than from islets of normal rats. Insulin release from islets of CRF-PTX rats was significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than that from islets of CRF-control rats, and not different from insulin release from islets of normal rats. Forskolin and IBMX, which cause a rise in cAMP, significantly stimulated glucose-induced insulin release from islets of normal, CRF-control and CRF-PTX rats, but the increments from baseline were not significantly different between the three groups. Both early and total insulin release from islets obtained from PTH-treated rats with normal renal function were markedly and significantly (P less than 0.01) lower than values obtained from normal rats. Calcium contents of the pancreas of CRF-control and PTH-treated rats were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than that in pancreas of normal rats and CRF-PTX animals, and values in the latter two groups of animals were not significantly different. The results show that: 1) CRF impairs insulin release from pancreatic islets; 2) this abnormality is reversed by prior parathyroidectomy; and 3) hyperparathyroidism induced by PTH-treatment in normal rats impairs insulin release from pancreatic islets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We used a human renin antiserum and an immunoperoxidase method to investigate the distribution of renin-containing cells in 19 adult polycystic kidneys: 9 autopsy and 10 nephrectomy cases. These cells were present in residual normal kidney, in scarred renal parenchyma and in area of fibrous tissue. They were situated mainly in juxtaglomerular apparatuses (JGAs) and in the walls of arteries and arterioles. A semi-quantitative analysis showed hyperplasia of JGA renin-containing cells in the untreated autopsy cases. In both groups there was an abnormal distribution of renin-containing cells; only 50% were located in the JGAs the remainder were mainly in the walls of small arteries. These were often thin, attenuated vessels in the walls of cysts. Cells containing renin were also found isolated in fibrous tissue separate from the arterial tree. This abnormal location of the renin-containing cells suggests that they may respond to different stimuli than those in normal kidneys, and their abnormal distribution could affect both the intrarenal action of renin and also its release into the blood.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 29 patients affected by acute renal failure due to multiple myeloma with Bence-Jones proteinuria greater than 1 g/day to evaluate the effectiveness of plasma exchange in the treatment of severe myeloma nephropathy. Renal failure was severe enough to require dialysis in 24 cases, while the remaining 5 patients showed serum creatinine levels greater than 5 mg/dl. The patients were randomly allocated to Group I (15 patients undergoing plasma exchange together with corticosteroids, cytotoxic drug, hemodialysis only when needed) or to Group II (14 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis together with corticosteroids and cytotoxic drug). In Group I Bence-Jones proteinuria decreased dramatically (P less than 0.01) with a significant increase in urine output (P less than 0.001), while Group II presented a slight reduction in Bence-Jones proteinuria without a significant increase in daily diuresis. Thirteen out the 15 Group I patients recovered renal function reaching serum creatinine levels less than or equal to 2.5 mg/dl in most cases. Only two patients in Group II improved renal failure well enough to stop dialysis. The one-year survival rate was significantly higher in Group I (66%) than in Group II (28%, P less than 0.01). We conclude that plasma exchange associated to chemotherapy rapidly removes large amounts of light chains, improves both renal function and long-term survival expectancies.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1979 and 1981 the UK Trial of Early Detection of Breast Cancer enrolled women aged 45-64 living in eight locations in the United Kingdom. Annual screening by clinical examination of the breast, with mammography in alternate years, was provided over 7 years for 45,841 women; 63,636 were offered teaching in breast self-examination and were provided with a self-referral clinic; and 127,117, for whom no extra services were provided, form a comparison population. Over the 7 years from the start of the trial a reduction in the risk of dying from breast cancer in women offered screening relative to that in the comparison population was observed. The reduction was 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.69-1.08) when no allowance was made for underlying differences in breast cancer mortality between the populations, but rose to 20% (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-1.01) when adjusted for differences in pretrial mortality rates. These differences fall short of statistical significance. No reduction in mortality was observed during the first 5 years but thereafter the gap widens. These results, though in themselves inconclusive, are consistent with the hypothesis that screening can achieve a worthwhile mortality reduction. No difference in mortality has so far been observed between women offered teaching in breast self-examination and the comparison population.\r"

The resultant strain, CVD 103, evaluated for safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy as a live oral vaccine, was highly attenuated and elicited strong antibacterial and antitoxic immune responses; a single dose significantly protected volunteers against challenge with pathogenic V cholerae O1 of either serotype or biotype. A further derivative, CVD 103-HgR, which has an Hg++-resistance gene to differentiate it from wild-type vibrios, was also well-tolerated, immunogenic, and protective; moreover, faecal excretion of this derivative was significantly lower than that of CVD 103, which should minimise environmental spread of the vaccine. CVD 103-HgR is a candidate for expanded clinical trials in endemic areas.\r"

This therapeutic approach to radiation-induced granulocytopenia may therefore be useful after radiation and nuclear accidents.\r"

A survey of sequences corresponding to all or part of the known topo I binding sequence AGAACTTAGAGAAAATTTAAA in four fibrillar collagen genes (three of them dermal) and sixteen non-collagen genes showed a striking preponderance of the tetramer 5'-CTTA-3', comprising the core of this binding sequence, at the exon-intron junctions of the fibrillar collagen genes (59% compared with 16% in the control group). In addition, a non-random clustering of three potential topo I binding sites was seen within 350 base-pairs of 5' flanking DNA in the dermal collagen gene alpha 2(I), and a fourth site occurred in the promoter region of the alpha 1(III) gene. The findings suggest that a selective vulnerability to the action of Sc1-70/topo I is built into the structure of the dermal collagen genes.\r"

The resultant improvements in our understanding of the genetic basis of Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and DMD serve as models for similar investigation of other heritable disorders. These genetic advances have outpaced concurrent work on the molecular pathogenesis of the dystrophic process, with the curious result that inferences about the DMD protein's amino acid sequence have preceded any information about its function or intracellular localization. In recognition that this foundation sets the stage for the rapid elucidation of the disease's pathogenesis, we review the experimental basis of such advances, with reference to relevant progress in basic myology, pathology, and molecular biology. We conclude with a view towards the ultimate clinical implications of these experimental breakthroughs.\r"
