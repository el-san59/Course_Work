  ".W": "In order to investigate the mechanisms of the hyperreactivity of the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) the resetting of TGF by chronic dietary NaCl loading was studied in SHR and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). This treatment is known to reset the TGF by an inhibitory factor in tubular fluid and not by alterations of the intrinsic characteristics of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA). TGF reactivity, and its resetting, were determined by loop of Henle perfusion with artificial late proximal tubular fluid and with harvested endogenous tubular fluid respectively. Dietary effects of the high sodium intake were measured by means of the systolic blood pressure (SBP), plasma volume (PV), and renal sodium excretion. The 4-week dietary treatment had no significant influence on SBP in WKY, whereas it accelerated the rise of SBP in SHR significantly. After 1 week of treatment, PV was increased in both WKY and SHR as compared with the control groups kept on the normal diet. Whereas PV in WKY declined to control values over the next 3 weeks, SHR remained expanded. GFR was similar in all groups, whereas urinary sodium excretion was significantly increased in salt-loaded SHR and WKY. Dietary salt loading was paralleled by the appearance of a TGF-inhibiting substance in the tubular fluid in SHR and WKY. However, when assayed with artificial late proximal tubular fluid, hyperreactivity was similar in normal and salt-loaded SHR as compared with WKY. Thus, in SHR TGF hyperreactivity is maintained in spite of volume expansion and TGF resetting by a humoral factor in tubular fluid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This upward shift of the TGF response curve together with maintenance of an RBF autoregulation during plasma expansion lead to the conclusion that the TGF mechanism apparently plays a significant role in the control of glomerular hemodynamics, despite the marked vasodilation occurring during acute volume expansion.\r"

Hence local blood flow may be involved in the baroreceptor control of renin release.

Immediately after entering the glomerulus the afferent arteriole splits into superficially located branches which supply the lobules. The capillaries of each lobule first run towards the urinary pole; these parts of each lobule establish the afferent domain. The capillaries of each lobule running back towards the vascular pole establish the efferent domain. The afferent domain represents the major part of the tuft; it has the shape of an incomplete globe with a deep depression on one side within which the efferent domain is situated. The efferent arteriole is established inside the glomerular tuft within the efferent capillary domain. Generally tributaries from each lobule converge to form the intraglomerular segment of the efferent arteriole, which leaves the tuft by passing through the mesangium of the glomerular stalk. At this site the intraglomerular segment of the efferent arteriole is fully surrounded by the mesangium; consequently, it is exposed to the intramesangial pressure.\r"

  ".W": "While the contribution of angiotensin (Ang) II to the regulation of various renal functions is recognized, evidence exists that the kidney also is a major site for the production of Ang II. Since circulating renin in plasma accounts for only a small portion of intrarenally produced Ang II, we investigated juxtaglomerular (JG) cells as a source of Ang I and II. Light and electronmicroscopic immunohistochemical methods revealed highly concentrated Ang I and II in JG cells. This finding was supported by the demonstration of colocalization of renin, Ang I, and Ang II in cultured JG cells and in dense granular fractions of rat kidney separated by gradient centrifugation of rat kidney homogenate. Perfusion of rat kidney with Krebs-Ringer buffer containing bovine serum albumin showed that Ang I and Ang II are released in the perfusate in quantities which may account for a greater part of the intrarenal generation of Ang II observed in vivo. These results support the hypothesis that Ang II is intrarenally synthesized inside the JG cells, thereby contributing to the regulation of certain renal functions.\r"

Since the major functional side effects of cyclosporine are systemic vasoconstriction and renal vasoconstriction, the renin-angiotensin system could be involved. Also, an infrequent complication in man, vasculopathy, develops only in the afferent arteriole, where renin production is most abundant. Hence, this information is now reviewed and incorporated into a single pathophysiological concept, with the implication that renin activation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of cyclosporine-induced functional and structural lesions, merits further attention.\r"

  ".W": "As a target site for angiotensin II (A-II), renal proximal tubule is unique in that it may be equipped with a local A-II generating system and that both basolateral and apical membranes may be accessible for the action of A-II. We have recently conducted studies to examine these possibilities. With in vitro cultured proximal tubular cells, we have demonstrated de novo synthesis of angiotensinogen and renin. With isolated renal brush border membrane (BBM), we have confirmed the presence of A-II receptors and found that A-II directly stimulated BBM Na+/H+ exchange. In search of the signal transduction mechanism, we have found that A-II also activated BBM phospholipase A2 (PLA) and that BBM contained a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide binding protein (G-protein) which mediates the effects of A-II. Further studies showed that prevention of PLA activation abolished the effect of A-II on Na+/H+ exchange, and that activation of PLA by mellitin and the addition of arachidonic acid similarly enhanced BBM Na+/H+ exchange activity, suggesting that PLA activation may mediate the stimulatory effect of A-II on BBM Na+/H+ exchange. These results thus indicate that a local signal transduction mechanism involving G-protein mediated PLA activation exists in renal BBM which mediates the effect of A-II on Na+/H+ exchange. Taken together, we propose that, independent of A-II in the circulation, local luminal A-II may serve as an important regulatory system on sodium transport in renal proximal tubule.\r"

To study this step, we measured macula densa (MD) cell volume and membrane potentials in the isolated perfused ascending limb of the loop of Henle with attached glomerulus with MD segments (cTAL-MD). Addition of furosemide reduced cell volume rapidly and the effect could be reversed on removal of the drug. From the time course of cell volume changes hydraulic conductivity could be measured both in the basolateral and apical cell membrane. It was found that the apical cell membrane constituted the main barrier for water flow with a low hydraulic conductance, while the basolateral hydraulic conductance was quite high. Measurements of the basolateral electrical potential in the MD cells have shown a mean electrical potential of -56 mV. This potential was hyperpolarized by the addition of furosemide, the Cl channel blocker NPPB, or during a reduction of luminal NaCl from 150 to 30 mM, and depolarized when bath Cl concentration was reduced from 150 to 30 mM. These results are consistent with the following model for electrolytes transported and similar to the one described in the cTAL [15]. In the luminal cell membrane there is an Na-K-2Cl cotransporter that takes these ions into the MD cells and there is a potassium recycling through a K channel. On the basolateral membrane side there is an Na-K pump and a Cl channel through which chloride is transported out of the MD cell. The Na-K pump activity seems to be only 1/40 of that in the cTAL cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Another step is transport through basolateral Cl- channels. In the present study the intracellular Cl- concentration, [Cl-]i, was measured in the MD and cortical thick ascending limb (cTAL) cells, and the concentration changes elicited by blocking the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport with furosemide or by lowering the luminal NaCl concentration determined. We also investigated the effects of blocking the basolateral Cl- channels. A preparation consisting of a segment of the cTAL, MD cells, and the attached glomerulus was dissected from rabbit kidneys. The preparation was loaded with the Cl(-)-sensitive fluorophore SPQ, and perfused by using the isolated and perfused tubule technique. The intracellular chloride concentration was determined with a video system using digital imaging that measured the intensity of the emitted SPQ fluorescence. The T 1/2 of the leakage of SPQ was found to be (197 +/- 60) min (n = 9). With 150 mM NaCl in the lumen and bath, [Cl-]i in MD cells was 47 +/- 13 mM (n = 8) and 54 +/- 13 mM (n = 5) in cTAL cells.

This study also indicates that no large changes in MD [Ca+2]i can be observed under maneuvers that are known to affect the autoregulatory mechanisms of single nephron glomerular filtration rate. Therefore, it is less likely that MD [Ca+2]i could be a link in the transmission of the signal from the MD cells to the rest of the cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus for the release of the TGF mechanism and/or renin. Possibly some other mechanism like the electrolyte transport itself, that can alter the solute concentration and tonicity of the Goormaghtigh cell field (juxtaglomerular interstitium), may be the signal to proceed with the rest of the events developed by the juxtaglomerular apparatus to control single nephron glomerular filtration rate.\r"

Earlier studies have shown a reabsorption-dependent chloride concentration on the basolateral side of the epithelium (juxtaglomerular interstitium, JGI) at the site of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. In the present study measurements were made of chloride activities in the immediate vicinity of the basolateral side of the tubular epithelial cells at high and low tubular perfusion rates. Extremely high chloride activities (2451 +/- 625 mM (SE), n = 7) were found in the JGI at maximal reabsorption, while more plasma-like values were noted at zero tubular flow. The flow-dependent salt reabsorption may be a powerful signal for tubuloglomerular feedback from the tubular lumen to the effector cells.\r"

  ".W": "Tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) is generally regarded as being mediated by a single, humoral vasoconstrictor acting on the afferent arteriole. Examination of the literature reveals, however, that acute activation or blockade of TGF may, under certain circumstances, be associated with vasomotion of the efferent arteriole, either in the same or in the opposite direction as the afferent arteriole. The former appears to be the case particularly when myogenic autoregulation is attenuated, for example, with application of calcium channel blockers. Experiments in which the TGF signal is chronically lost by preventing tubular fluid flow at the macula densa also suggest participation of the efferent arteriole. Under these circumstances, stop flow pressure and single nephron filtration rate increase and glomerular blood flow falls. TGF activity at this stage is modestly enhanced. Taken together, these findings suggest efferent vasoconstriction. After a delay of some hours, vasoconstriction is also apparent in the afferent arteriole. It is not clear whether the mechanism involved in this response is related to the \"normal\" TGF response. Together, these findings are hard to reconcile with the hypothesis of a single vasoconstrictor acting on the afferent arteriole.\r"

In fact, previous evidence has suggested a role for both adenosine and angiotensin in the TGF mechanism. Acceleration of adenosine deamination as well as adenosine receptor blockade markedly reduced the effect of distal NaCl concentration on SNGFR or PSF. Conversely, inhibition of adenosine breakdown or cellular adenosine uptake, two interventions which are likely to increase interstitial adenosine levels, augmented TGF responses. The same effect was seen when adenosine1-receptor analogs were locally applied by microinfusion. The administration of A-II-converting-enzyme blockers or A-II-receptor antagonists reduced TGF responses, while peritubular or intravenous administration of A-II augmented them. Furthermore, the inhibition of TGF responses caused by volume expansion-induced reductions in plasma A-II concentrations could be restored to normal by A-II infusion. The present results raise the possibility that normal TGF responsiveness depends upon the availability of both adenosine and A-II in sufficiently high concentrations. Figure 1 outlines a mechanism of this mutual dependency. One may assume that adenosine is generated as a consequence of NaCl-dependent changes in NaCl transport by macula densa cells or by TALH cells in the immediate vicinity of the macula densa. The absence of capillaries in the juxtaglomerular interstitium could permit an accumulation of the autacoid to an extent not possible in other regions of the renal interstitium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To establish whether a further species possesses these morphological features, the JGA region was examined in the human kidney. Tissue was obtained by needle biopsy from patients and conventional electron-microscopical procedures including serial sections were utilized to reevaluate the morphology of JGA. Both the endothelial fenestration in the wall of the afferent arteriole and protrusions with filtration slits of urinary space into the lacis, were observed with remarkable heterogeneity. The occurrence of these features of JGA in such diverse mammalian species as rat, mouse, Tupaia, and man suggests that these structures may be involved in regulatory process and the proposed \"short loop\" feedback mechanism may be a general phenomenon.\r"

The high frequency component most likely represents an intrinsic vascular, myogenic, mechanism. The gain maximum of the admittance in the frequency range corresponding to the autonomous tubular oscillations indicates that the dynamic characteristics responsible for the occurrence of the spontaneous tubular oscillations must be common to a significant fraction of the total nephron population.\r"

There was no hospital mortality and only one patient had any notable degree of air trapping in the native lung. Substantial improvement in pulmonary function was seen as early as 2 weeks after transplantation, with significant functional improvement seen by 6 weeks, despite some residual ventilation-perfusion mismatch. We have demonstrated the utility and safety of single lung transplantation for patients with end-stage emphysema, and it is our operation of choice in recipients more than 50 years of age.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have provided conflicting evidence as to whether an increased risk of mediastinitis is associated with use of the internal mammary artery as a coronary bypass graft. In this study the effects of internal mammary artery grafts on wound complications were analyzed in a prospective, nonrandomized fashion. At New York University Medical Center from January 1985 through May 1988, 2356 patients underwent isolated coronary revascularization. Among these patients 1394 received one or more internal mammary artery grafts (group I) and 962 had vein grafts only (group II). Group I had a mean age of 59.5 years versus 67.7 years in group II; diabetes was equally present in both groups (22.7% versus 24.7%). Operative mortality rate was 1.3% in group I and 5.6% in group II. Sternal infection was significantly more prevalent in group I (2.2%, 31/1394) than in group II (0.8%, 8/962). Multivariate analysis revealed that aortic crossclamp time, use of a single internal mammary artery graft, use of a double mammary graft, and diabetes were associated with increased risk of sternal infection. The use of bilateral internal mammary artery grafting doubled the odds ratio of the risk compared with use of a single mammary graft, and the combination of diabetes and double internal mammary artery grafts increased the odds ratio 13.9-fold. Patients with an internal mammary artery graft who had sternal infection had a longer period of hospitalization than patients without a mammary artery graft who had sternal infection. We conclude that the risk of sternal infection is increased by the use of an internal mammary artery graft, especially use of double mammary grafts in the presence of diabetes.\r"

All patients had repeated cycles of mapping and resection of arrhythmogenic foci in the normothermic beating heart until ventricular tachycardia was no longer inducible. Eighty-six patients (93%) survived to hospital discharge. The survival rate in patients normotensive at the time of operation was 98% and in patients in shock at the time of operation, 43%. By Cox regression analysis, preoperative shock was the significant predictor (p less than 0.001) of operative mortality. Seventy-four of the 86 operative survivors (86%) had no sustained ventricular tachycardia at initial postoperative electrophysiologic study when receiving no antiarrhythmic drugs. Eighty-three of the 86 operative survivors (97%) had no sustained ventricular tachycardia at final postoperative electrophysiologic study when using antiarrhythmic drugs as needed. After a median follow-up of 21 months (range 1 to 79 months) there were 4 sudden cardiac deaths, 12 other cardiac deaths, and 3 noncardiac deaths. There were no documented nonfatal episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia after hospital discharge. Use of the sequential endocardial resection technique is effective in curing ventricular tachycardia with low operative morbidity and mortality.\r"

Twenty-six patients had acute type A, 7 had acute type B, 7 had chronic type A, and 7 had chronic type B aortic dissections. Of the 33 patients with acute dissections, 11 (7 acute type A and 4 acute type B) underwent concomitant arch repair with an operative (less than or equal to 30 days) mortality rate of 55% (35% to 73%, +/- 1 asymmetric 70% confidence limit) (2 of 7 acute type A and 4 of 4 acute type B). Concomitant arch repair was omitted in 22 patients with acute dissections (19 acute type A and 3 acute type B); the operative mortality rate was 41% (29% to 54%) (7 of 19 acute type A and 2 of 3 acute type B) (p = not significant versus arch repair). The overall survival rate for those with arch repair was 45% +/- 15% (+/- 1 standard error of the estimate) at 4 years, compared with 43% +/- 11% for patients without arch repair (p = not significant). Considering the type of dissection, the 4-year survival estimate for patients with acute type A dissections who underwent arch repair (5 hemiarch and 2 total arch) was 71% +/- 17% (versus 44% +/- 12% for acute type A patients without arch repair). There were no survivors among the 4 patients with acute type B dissections who had an arch repair (1 hemiarch and 3 total arch), whereas patients with acute type B dissections who did not undergo concomitant arch repair had a 4-year survival estimate of 33% +/- 27% (p = not significant versus arch repair). Four other patients with acute type B dissections resulting from an arch tear were managed medically and tended to have a slightly better prognosis (2-year survival estimate of 75% +/- 22% versus 14% +/- 13% for all surgically treated acute type B patients), but again this difference was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis of the 47 surgical patients revealed that advanced age (p = 0.0008), preoperative dissection complications (p = 0.02), and other coexistent medical problems (p = 0.03) were the only significant, independent determinants of overall mortality. Initial arch repair was not a significant predictor. Nine percent (2/22) of patients with acute type A dissections who initially underwent isolated ascending aortic replacement required subsequent arch replacement; 1 died after reoperation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

At each study interval during endothelial cell regeneration, vascular smooth muscle contracted and relaxed normally to direct stimulation with norepinephrine and sodium nitroprusside. Endothelium-dependent contractions to serotonin returned to normal at 1 week and developed into a hypercontractile response at 8 weeks. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine returned to normal at 8 weeks, but endothelium-dependent relaxations to adenosine diphosphate remained impaired. These experiments demonstrate that regenerating endothelium regains the ability to produce contracting factor before relaxing factor, and it even exhibits potentiated contractile activity 8 weeks after injury. Thus, after direct arterial injury, regenerating endothelium has abnormal endothelium-dependent function that predisposes the vessel to vasospasm and thrombosis.\r"

  ".W": "The endothelium modulates vascular tone by releasing a variety of vasoactive compounds that relax or contract the underlying vascular smooth muscle. We have previously demonstrated that regenerated endothelium exhibits endothelium-dependent hypercontraction to the platelet-derived compound serotonin (or 5-HT). To determine if this hypercontraction is mediated by superoxide anion produced by the endothelium, we performed balloon catheter denudation on the thoracic and abdominal aorta of male Lewis rats. Eight weeks after arterial injury, endothelium-dependent responses to serotonin were examined in tissue bath experiments. Vascular rings (5 mm in length), with and without endothelium, were contracted with norepinephrine and then exposed to serotonin (10(-9) to 3 x 10(-5) mol/L). Vascular rings with regenerated endothelium exhibited hypercontraction to serotonin (251% +/- 25% of initial norepinephrine contraction; p less than 0.05 compared with control rings, 175% +/- 13%). Removal of the endothelium (133% +/- 6%) or treatment with superoxide dismutase (184% +/- 7%), with or without catalase, prevented the endothelium-dependent constrictor effect of the serotonin. Ketanserin suppressed the vasoconstrictor effect of serotonin on control (93% +/- 15%) and regenerated (105% +/- 9%) rings with endothelium, indicating that the serotonin effect is mediated through the 5-HT2-serotonergic receptor. Deferoxamine or heat-inactivated superoxide dismutase did not modify the response. These observations support the hypothesis that superoxide anion is an endothelium-derived contracting factor produced by regenerated endothelium after intimal injury.\r"

Of 46 children who have undergone heart transplantation at our institution between June 1984 and February 1990, 7 (15%; mean age 8 +/- 3 years; range 1 to 18 years) have previously undergone such operations: right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit/homograft for levo-transposition of the great arteries (2), Waterston shunt for tricuspid and pulmonary atresia (1), pulmonary artery banding for single ventricle (1), Fontan procedure for single ventricle (1), first-stage Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (1), and classic right Blalock-Taussig shunt for atrioventricular canal with pulmonic stenosis (1). Three categories of pulmonary artery anatomy that require different approaches to reconstruction at the time of transplantation are recognized: abnormalities of position, pulmonary outflow obstruction, and previous systemic- or atrial-pulmonary connections. At operation, individualized pulmonary arterial reconstruction was employed, including use of previously created right ventricular-pulmonary artery conduits/homografts and angioplasty (with and without pericardial patches). Transplantation was successful in all patients. Posttransplant right ventricular-pulmonary artery pressure gradients and pulmonary vascular resistance indices were acceptable, with a tendency to decrease with time. Two patients had critical right ventricular failure postoperatively; one of them required support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. There was no perioperative mortality, with three deaths occurring from 5 to 39 months after transplantation. All surviving patients are in New York Heart Association functional class I. Techniques borrowed from the repair of congenital cardiac lesions can be applied to subgroups of children undergoing heart transplantation. Additional length of donor aorta and pulmonary artery should be harvested for possible use in designing pulmonary artery connections. Previous palliative operations involving the pulmonary arteries with associated complex pulmonary artery anatomy are not of themselves an insurmountable obstacle to successful heart transplantation.\r"

  ".U": "91350829\r", 
  ".W": "The intention of this study was to determine whether glucose is beneficial in a cardioplegic solution when the end products of metabolism produced during the ischemic period are intermittently removed. The experimental model used was the isolated working rat heart, with a 3-hour hypothermic 10 degrees C cardioplegic arrest period. Cardioplegic solutions tested were the St. Thomas' Hospital No. 2 and a modified Krebs-Henseleit cardioplegic solution. Glucose (11 mmol/L) was beneficial when multidose cardioplegia was administered every 30 minutes. Including glucose in Krebs-Henseleit cardioplegic solution improved postischemic recovery of aortic output from 57.0% +/- 1.8% to 65.8% +/- 2.2%; p less than 0.025. The addition of glucose to St. Thomas' Hospital No. 2 cardioplegic solution improved aortic output from 74.6% +/- 1.9% to 87.4% +/- 1.9%; p less than 0.005. Furthermore, a dose-response curve showed that a glucose concentration of 20 mmol/L gave no better recovery than 0 mmol/L, and glucose in St. Thomas Hospital No. 2 cardioplegic solution was beneficial only in the range of 7 to 11 mmol/L. In addition, we showed that multidose cardioplegia was beneficial independent of glucose. Multidose St. Thomas' Hospital No. 2 cardioplegia, as opposed to single-dose cardioplegia, improved aortic output recovery from 57.4% +/- 5.2% to 74.6% +/- 1.9%; p less than 0.025, and with St. Thomas' Hospital No. 2 cardioplegic solution plus glucose (11 mmol/L) aortic output recovery improved from 65.9% +/- 2.9% to 87.4% +/- 1.9%; p less than 0.005. Hence, at least in this screening model, the St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution should contain glucose in the range of 7 mmol/L to 11 mmol/L, provided multidose cardioplegia is given. We cautiously suggest extrapolation to the human heart, on the basis of supporting clinical arguments that appear general enough to apply to both rat and human metabolisms.\r"

The chest radiograph and echocardiogram were useful pointers to the diagnosis, but the electrocardiogram was not reliable. Antibiotics, surgical drainage, and pericardiectomy were used in all 12 cases. There was one death (8.3%), which occurred in a patient who was seen late. A review of the literature dealing with the diagnosis and management of this condition is presented. The importance of early diagnosis before a significant degree of cardiac tamponade occurs is noted. Although there is general agreement that surgical drainage is mandatory, the approach, methods of drainage, and extent of pericardial resection have been the subject of some discussion, and at least seven techniques are available. We conclude that pericardiectomy has a definite place in the management of purulent pericarditis.\r"

To settle this issue, we used deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry. Deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy patterns of tumors were able to be analyzed in 14 patients with two simultaneous pulmonary tumors resected by operation. These two tumors, with completely different patterns of deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy, were defined as synchronous lung cancers. Tumors were defined as lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis when both tumors showed diploidy or when at least one deoxyribonucleic acid index of abnormal clones between two aneuploid tumors was the same or almost identical. Tumors of the five patients with stage I disease were classified as synchronous lung cancers according to the criteria involving deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry. Both tumors were adenocarcinomas in four patients and large-cell and squamous cell carcinomas in one. Both tumors in four patients were located in the same lobe but different segments. All but one patient with different histologic types are alive without recurrence from 24 to 100 months after operation. Tumors of the nine patients with stage III disease in whom intrapulmonary metastasis was clinically suspected were classified as lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis according to the criteria. These data suggest that deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry of tumors may have diagnostic value in determining synchronous lung cancers.\r"

Complete excision of bulky residual masses may sometimes be difficult because of problems with exposure in the region of the great vessels and important nerves. Two cases are presented in which the Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (Valleylab Inc., Surgical Systems Division, Stamford, Conn.) facilitated excision of large masses after intensive chemotherapy. We found that the collapsed pseudocapsule remaining after aspiration of tumor mass allowed early improved exposure and safer dissection from neighboring vessels and neural structures. Complete excisions were accomplished and no viable tumor was found, so that the patients were spared the immediate need for further therapy. Both had uneventful recoveries.\r"

Chest roentgenography was the main method of diagnosis. Among the total of 508 surgical procedures performed, pulmonary cystectomy was the most common (61.4%), whereas pulmonary resection was used in 31.4% of patients. The arc 5 test was used to confirm the diagnosis. Results were positive in 85% of the patients in whom it was done. There were 12.9% immediate postoperative complications in 12.9%, with late complications occurring in 4.10% and an overall mortality rate of 4.21%. These data suggest that hydatid cyst is still a common disease in our country, causing an important number of hospital admissions and a high percentage of complications.\r"

Short-term experiments consisted of 30 tubular grafts (35 x 8 mm), either of tanned collagen or polytetrafluoroethylene, that were sutured in the infrarenal inferior vena cava of pigs and removed 1 hour after implantation. There was no significant difference between the extent of the thrombus-lined graft surface in the biologic group and that in the polytetrafluoroethylene group. The amount of inner thrombus on tanned collagen grafts was significantly correlated to platelet activity. Long-term experiments involved 30 similar segments of both materials, which were sutured in the inferior vena cava and harvested 7, 14, 28, 56, and 112 days after operation. The 112-day patency rate of collagen grafts was 67%. The 56-day patency rate of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts was 16%. The difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Collagen grafts were lined by a thin neointima (200 micron) in all but two cases. The neointima was completely endothelialized within 4 weeks from implantation. In conclusion, tanned collagen grafts may represent a suitable material for venous replacement.\r"

  ".W": "The objectives of this study were to determine whether veins subjected to barotrauma in situ undergo lipid uptake and morphologic changes to the same extent as veins grafted into the arterial circulation. Saphenous veins in seven stump-tailed macaque monkeys were exposed bilaterally and were circumferentially dissected free from surrounding tissue only at isolated sites. Segments of the veins were distended for 1 minute at hydrostatic pressures of 125 or 350 mm Hg. An undistended segment served as control. A cephalic vein graft was interposed in the femoral artery for comparison with in situ veins. The animals were fed a diet that sustains plasma cholesterol levels of approximately 225 mg/dl. Saphenous veins and the cephalic vein grafts were explanted at 3 months for biochemical and histologic analyses. Cholesterol content in undistended saphenous veins was similar to that in veins distended at 125 or 350 mm Hg--105 +/- 15, 122 +/- 14, and 109 +/- 30 micrograms/100 mg wet tissue weight, respectively. Cholesterol content in cephalic vein grafts, 473 +/- 122 micrograms/100 mg, was greater (p less than 0.001) than in saphenous veins at all distention pressures studied. There was no difference among the distention pressures in the intimal fraction of saphenous vein wall, with the pooled value being 20% +/- 12%. This contrasted with the value of 59% +/- 11% in cephalic vein grafts (p less than 0.01). Endothelial coverage of the luminal surface in saphenous veins was similar among the levels of barotrauma, with the pooled value being 83% +/- 15%. Less of the lumen was covered with endothelium in cephalic vein grafts, 46% +/- 18% (p less than 0.01). Slightly more medial fibrosis was observed in cephalic vein grafts as compared with saphenous veins (p less than 0.05). These data demonstrate that barotrauma alone does not cause veins that remain in the venous system to undergo the lipid uptake or morphologic changes that occur in veins grafted into the arterial circulation in nonhuman primates.\r"

Biosynthetic growth hormone (GH) was given to 20 prepubertal children (eleven boys, nine girls; mean age 9.5 years, range 4-16) with CRF and severe growth retardation in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial. 6 months of subcutaneous injection of GH (4 IU/m2 per day) was either preceded or followed by 6 months of placebo injection. The patients had a full examination every 3 months. Sixteen children completed the study. Height velocity improved significantly with GH therapy (p less than 0.0001) and placebo (p less than 0.04), but the GH-induced height-velocity increase exceeded that of placebo by 2.9 cm per 6 months. There was a positive relationship between prestudy height velocity and height-velocity increase. Bone maturation was not affected. GH caused a significant increase in IGF-I and a moderate increase in IGF-II plasma concentrations. The pretreatment elevation of IGF-binding protein-1 decreased by almost 50% during GH therapy, while IGF-binding protein-3 increased significantly in concentration, although this increase was significantly smaller than the GH-induced increase in IGF-I. Fructosamine, lipid, and parathyroid concentrations remained constant. Renal function deterioration did not accelerate. Impressive height-velocity increase can be achieved with GH therapy in children with CRF and growth retardation without changes in renal function. Bone maturation appears unaffected suggesting improved final height. Treatment is best started before growth retardation becomes considerable.\r"

Peripheral blood cytokine concentrations were measured in twenty adults with severe, acute asthma, ten with mild asthma (intermittent inhaled beta-agonists), twelve with chronic asthma (high-dose inhaled steroids), and in sixteen healthy subjects. Interleukin-1 beta, tumour necrosis factor, and interferon gamma were not detected in most subjects. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor concentrations were higher in patients with severe asthma than in healthy subjects (median 179 vs 80 pg/ml; 95% confidence interval for difference 16-168; p = 0.009). Plasma concentrations of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were similar in all asthma groups (geometric mean in severe acute group 570 U/ml, mild group 559 U/ml, and chronic group 560 U/ml) and higher than those in healthy controls (361 U/ml, p less than 0.01). Sequential sIL-2R measurements were done in fifteen of the patients with severe acute asthma. There was no difference between baseline concentrations and those after 2 days of steroid treatment but by day 7 they had fallen significantly (ratio day 7/day 3 = 0.74, [95% CI 0.67-0.82]; p less than 0.001); however, there was no correlation with improvement in peak expiratory flow. This study provides further evidence for T-lymphocyte activation in asthma but shows that plasma sIL-2R is not a useful marker of disease activity.\r"

To clarify the features of this disorder 36 patients, aged 15 months to 37 years (median 7) with this syndrome were investigated; 91% were from rural areas. In 47%, a prodromal illness was reported in the preceding 4 weeks. Leg weakness and resistance to neck flexion were the earliest symptoms. The weakness ascended rapidly and symmetrically to affect the arms and respiratory muscles, with maximum weakness occurring a mean of 6 days after onset of weakness. Bulbar weakness occurred in 61% of patients, but only 1 had extraocular paresis. Respiratory assistance was needed by 31% of patients. Tendon reflexes were lost as weakness developed. 42% of patients had raised concentrations of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the mean cell count was 3 cells/microliters (range 0-12/microliters). Electrodiagnostic studies in 22 patients showed severe reductions in motor evoked amplitudes from distal stimulation. Sensory action potentials were normal. Electromyography revealed denervation potentials in limb muscles. The distinctive epidemiological, clinical, and neurophysiological characteristics of this illness suggest that the disorder is different from both Guillain-Barre syndrome and poliomyelitis. The neurophysiological findings support the hypothesis that the disorder is a reversible distal motor nerve terminal or anterior horn cell lesion.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of sinus venous thrombosis (SVT) is controversial. Although heparin has been used for this condition, many investigators have opposed its use because of the frequent occurrence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and SVT. Therefore we have evaluated anticoagulation with adjusted-dose intravenous heparin for treatment of aseptic SVT in a randomised, blinded (patient and observer), placebo-controlled study in 20 patients (10 heparin, 10 placebo). The clinical course of the two groups, as judged by a newly designed SVT-severity scale, started to differ in favour of the heparin group after 3 days of treatment (p less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test) and the difference remained significant (p less than 0.01) after 8 days of treatment. After 3 months, 8 of the heparin-treated patients had a complete clinical recovery and 2 had slight residual neurological deficits. In the placebo group, only 1 patient had a complete recovery, 6 patients had neurological deficits, and 3 patients died (p less than 0.01, modified Fisher's exact test). An additional retrospective study on the relation between heparin treatment and ICH in SVT patients was based on 102 patients, 43 of whom had an ICH. 27 of these patients were treated with dose-adjusted, intravenous heparin after the ICH. Of these 27 patients, 4 died (mortality 15%), and 14 patients completely recovered. Of the 13 patients that did not receive heparin after ICH, 9 died (mortality 69%) and only 3 patients completely recovered. We conclude that anticoagulation with dose-adjusted intravenous heparin is an effective treatment in patients with SVT and that ICH is not a contraindication to heparin treatment in these patients.\r"

Men with a palpably suspicious prostate or a serum PSA greater than 4 ng/ml were referred for transrectal ultrasonography and, if indicated, biopsy. 472 men (58%) were screened; of these 68 underwent transrectal ultrasonography and 29 biopsy. In 7 the biopsy specimen showed carcinoma. Serum PSA was better than digital examination as a screening test--all men with prostate cancer had raised concentrations of serum PSA, whereas only 1 had a palpably abnormal prostate. All 7 had localised disease, and 5 underwent radical prostatectomy. The best methods of patient recruitment were to send an appointment for screening and to \"tag\" the patient's notes.\r"

  ".W": "The increased number of medical negligence claims against obstetricians and gynaecologists has led to concerns about a trend towards defensive medical practice in the UK. The attitudes of obstetricians in the British Isles to tests of fetal and maternal wellbeing, which may influence decisions about patient care, were investigated in 3194 Fellows and Members of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Perceived accuracy of tests ranged from 86.3% for fetal blood sampling to 25.9% for biochemical tests. Despite some tests being perceived as having poor accuracy, all were widely used even by those who deemed them inaccurate. The most frequent explanations given for this paradoxical finding were that such tests were an aid to clinical judgement and were necessary for medicolegal reasons. Our data indicate that tests deemed to be inaccurate are used in clinical practice because some obstetricians fear litigation. Our findings were not influenced by age, gender, grade of doctor, or site of practice.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Measurement of adrenocorticotropin levels in plasma from the inferior petrosal sinuses of patients with Cushing's syndrome can distinguish adrenocorticotropin-secreting pituitary tumors (Cushing's disease) from other causes of the syndrome, principally ectopic adrenocorticotropin secretion from an occult tumor. However, it is unknown whether such measurement consistently identifies patients with Cushing's disease and whether testing with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) enhances the value of the procedure. METHODS. We prospectively studied 281 patients with Cushing's syndrome to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the procedure. Bilateral sampling was successfully accomplished in 278 patients, with no major morbidity; 262 of these patients underwent sampling before and after administration of ovine CRH. The adrenocorticotropin levels in the samples were used to calculate the ratio of the concentration in plasma from the inferior petrosal sinuses to the concentration in peripheral-blood plasma (the IPS:P ratio). RESULTS. The diagnosis of 246 patients was confirmed surgically as Cushing's disease in 215, as ectopic adrenocorticotropin syndrome in 20, and as primary adrenal disease in 11. An IPS:P ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 in basal samples identified 205 of the 215 patients with Cushing's disease (sensitivity, 95 percent), with no false positive results (specificity, 100 percent). A peak IPS:P ratio greater than or equal to 3.0 after CRH administration identified all 203 of the patients with Cushing's disease who received CRH (sensitivity, 100 percent), with no false positive results (specificity, 100 percent). The sensitivity was much lower when the adrenocorticotropin concentrations in the samples from one sinus were considered alone. In patients with Cushing's disease a difference of greater than or equal to 1.4-fold between the concentrations in the two sinuses (the adrenocorticotropin gradient) predicted the location of the microadenoma in 68 percent of 104 patients during basal sampling and in 71 percent of 105 patients after CRH administration. CONCLUSIONS. Simultaneous bilateral sampling of plasma from the inferior petrosal sinuses, with the adjunctive use of CRH, distinguishes patients with Cushing's disease from those with ectopic adrenocorticotropin secretion with high diagnostic accuracy.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has been identified as a cause of cutaneous or ocular infection among athletes involved in contact sports; in this context it is known as herpes gladiatorum. In July 1989, we investigated an outbreak among 175 high-school wrestlers attending a four-week intensive-training camp. Cases of infection were identified by review of medical records, interview and examination of the wrestlers, and culture of skin lesions. Oropharyngeal swabs were obtained for HSV-1 culture, and serum samples for HSV-1 serologic studies. HSV-1 isolates were compared by restriction-endonuclease analysis. RESULTS. HSV-1 infection was diagnosed in 60 wrestlers (34 percent). The lesions were on the head in 73 percent of the wrestlers, the extremities in 42 percent, and the trunk in 28 percent. HSV-1 was isolated from 21 wrestlers (35 percent), and in 39 (65 percent) infection was identified by clinical criteria. Five had conjunctivitis or blepharitis; none had keratitis. Constitutional symptoms were common, including fever (25 percent), chills (27 percent), sore throat (40 percent), and headache (22 percent). The attack rate varied significantly among the three practice groups, ranging from 25 percent for practice group 1 (lightweights) to 67 percent for group 3 (heavyweights). Restriction-endonuclease analysis identified four strains of HSV-1 among the 21 isolates. All 10 isolates from practice group 3 were identical (strain A), and 5 of 7 isolates from practice group 2 (middleweights) were identical (strain B), which suggested concurrent transmission of different strains within different groups. HSV-1 was not isolated from any oropharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSIONS. Herpes gladiatorum may cause substantial morbidity among wrestlers, and it is primarily transmitted by direct skin-to-skin contact. Prompt identification and exclusion of wrestlers with skin lesions may reduce transmission.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. It is not clear to what extent maternal metabolism during pregnancy affects the cognitive and behavioral function of the offspring by altering brain development in utero. To investigate this question, we correlated measures of metabolism in pregnant diabetic and nondiabetic women with the intellectual development of their offspring. METHODS. The study included 223 pregnant women and their singleton offspring: 89 women had diabetes before pregnancy (pregestational diabetes mellitus), 99 had the onset of diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus), and 35 had normal carbohydrate metabolism during their pregnancy. We correlated measures of maternal glucose and lipid metabolism (fasting plasma glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c levels, episodes of hypoglycemia, episodes of acetonuria, and plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acid levels) with two measures of intellectual development in the offspring--the mental development index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, given at the age of two years, and the Stanford--Binet Intelligence Scale, given at the ages of three, four, and five years and expressed as an average of the three scores. RESULTS. After correction for socioeconomic status, race or ethnic origin, and patient group, the children's mental-development-index scores at the age of two years correlated inversely with the mothers' third-trimester plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (r = -0.21, P less than 0.01); the average Stanford-Binet scores correlated inversely with third-trimester plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (r = -0.20, P less than 0.02) and free fatty acid (r = -0.27, P less than 0.002) levels. No other correlations were significant. Including various perinatal events (e.g., prematurity and acidemia) in the analyses did not alter the results. CONCLUSIONS. Maternal diabetes during pregnancy may affect behavioral and intellectual development in the offspring. The associations between gestational ketonemia in the mother and a lower IQ in the child warrant continued efforts to avoid ketoacidosis and accelerated starvation in all pregnant women.\r"

  ".U": "91351251\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hyperinflation of the lungs, dysfunction of the diaphragm may contribute to respiratory decompensation. We evaluated the contractile function of the diaphragm in well-nourished patients with stable COPD, using supramaximal, bilateral phrenic-nerve stimulation, which provides information about the strength and inspiratory action of the diaphragm. METHODS. In eight patients with COPD and five control subjects of similar age, the transdiaphragmatic pressure generated by the twitch response to phrenic-nerve stimulation was recorded at various base-line lung volumes, from functional residual capacity to total lung capacity, and during relaxation and graded voluntary efforts at functional residual capacity (twitch occlusion). RESULTS. At functional residual capacity, the twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure ranged from 10.9 to 26.6 cm of water (1.07 to 2.60 kPa) in the patients and from 19.8 to 37.1 cm of water (1.94 to 3.64 kPa) in the controls, indicating considerable overlap between the two groups. The ratio of esophageal pressure to twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure, an index of the inspiratory action of the diaphragm, was -0.50 +/- 0.05 in the patients, as compared with -0.43 +/- 0.02 in the controls (indicating more efficient inspiratory action in the patients than in the controls). At comparable volumes, the twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure and esophageal-to-transdiaphragmatic pressure ratio were higher in the patients than in normal subjects, indicating that the strength and inspiratory action of the diaphragm in the patients were actually better than in the controls. Twitch occlusion (a measure of the maximal activation of the diaphragm) indicated near-maximal activation in the patients with COPD, and the maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure was 106.9 +/- 13.8 cm of water (10.48 +/- 1.35 kPa). CONCLUSIONS. The functioning of the diaphragms of the patients with stable COPD is as good as in normal subjects at the same lung volume. Compensatory phenomena appear to counterbalance the deleterious effects of hyperinflation on the contractility and inspiratory action of the diaphragm in patients with COPD. Our findings cast doubt on the existence of chronic fatigue of the diaphragm in such patients and therefore on the need for therapeutic interventions aimed at improving diaphragm function.\r"

By starlight, a single class of photoreceptors, the rods, function, whereas by daylight, three classes, the blue-, green- and red-sensitive cones, are active and provide colour vision. Only by comparing the rates of quantal absorption in more than one photoreceptor class is colour vision possible. Although the comparisons generally take place between the cones, they can involve the rods as well. Here we investigate the wavelength discrimination of an extremely rare group of individuals, blue-cone monochromats, who have only rods and one class of cones. We find that these individuals can distinguish wavelengths (440 to 500 nm) in the twilight region where the rods and blue-sensitive cones are simultaneously active.\r"

  ".W": "Membrane depolarization causes many kinds of ion channels to open, a process termed activation. For both Na+ channels and Ca2+ channels, kinetic analysis of current has suggested that during activation the channel undergoes several conformational changes before reaching the open state. Structurally, these channels share a common motif: the central element is a large polypeptide with four repeating units of homology (repeats I-IV), each containing a voltage-sensing region, the S4 segment. This suggests that the distinct conformational transitions inferred from kinetic analysis may be equated with conformational changes of the individual structural repeats. To investigate the molecular basis of channel activation, we constructed complementary DNAs encoding chimaeric Ca2+ channels in which one or more of the four repeats of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor are replaced by the corresponding repeats derived from the cardiac dihydropyridine receptor. We report here that repeat I determines whether the chimaeric Ca2+ channel shows slow (skeletal muscle-like) or rapid (cardiac-like) activation.\r"

  ".W": "Mutations at the steel (sl) and dominant white spotting (W) loci in the mouse affect primordial germ cells (PGC), melanoblasts and haemopoietic stem cells. The W gene encodes a cell-surface receptor of the tyrosine kinase family, the proto-oncogene c-kit. In situ analysis has shown c-kit messenger RNA expression in PGC in the early genital ridges. The Sl gene encodes the ligand for this receptor, a peptide growth factor, called here stem cell factor (SCF). SCF mRNA is expressed in many regions of the early mouse embryo, including the areas of migration of these cell types. It is important now to identify the role of the Sl-W interaction in the development of these migratory embryonic stem cell populations. Using an in vitro assay system, we show that SCF increases both the overall numbers and colony sizes of migratory PGC isolated from wild-type mouse embryos, and cultured on irradiated feeder layers of STO cells (a mouse embryonic fibroblast line). In the absence of feeder cells, SCF causes a large increase in the initial survival and apparent motility of PGC in culture. But labelling with bromodeoxyuridine shows that SCF is not, by itself, a mitogen for PGC. SCF does not exert a chemotropic effect on PGC in in vitro assays. These results suggest that SCF in vivo is an essential requirement for PGC survival. This demonstrates the control of the early germ-line population by a specific trophic factor.\r"

Mutations at both these loci affect mast cells, primordial germ cells (PGCs), haemopoietic stem cells and melanocytes. In many Sl and W mutants, the rapid proliferation of PGC that normally occurs between day 7 and 13.5 of embryonic development fails to occur. As c-kit is expressed in PGCs while MGF is expressed in the surrounding mesenchyme, MGF might promote the proliferation of PGCs. Here we report that MGF is essential for PGC survival in culture, but does not stimulate PGC proliferation. Moreover, whereas both the transmembrane and soluble proteolytic cleavage forms of MGF stimulate mast-cell proliferation, soluble MGF has a relatively limited ability to support survival of PGCs in culture, thus explaining the sterility in mice carrying the steel-dickie (Sld) mutation, which encodes only a soluble form of MGF, and providing a functional role for a transmembrane growth factor.\r"

The glp-1 product is required for induction of germ-line proliferation and for embryogenesis. By contrast, lin-12 mediates somatic cell interactions, including those between the precursor cells that form the vulval hypodermis (VPCs). Here we analyse an unusual allele of glp-1, glp-1(q35), which displays a semidominant multivulva phenotype (Muv), as well as the typical recessive, loss-of-function Glp phenotypes (sterility and embryonic lethality). We find that the effects of glp-1(q35) on VPC development mimic those of dominant lin-12 mutations, even in the absence of lin-12 activity. The glp-1(q35) gene bears a nonsense mutation predicted to eliminate the 122 C-terminal amino acids, including a ProGluSerThr (PEST) sequence thought to destabilize proteins. We suggest that the carboxy terminus bears a negative regulatory domain which normally inactivates glp-1 in the VPCs. We propose that inappropriate glp-1(q35) activity can substitute for lin-12 to determine vulval fate, perhaps by driving the VPCs to proliferate.\r"

One approach to treatment would be to introduce the normal dystrophin gene into diseased muscle cells. When pure plasmid DNA is injected into rodent skeletal or cardiac muscle, the cells express reporter genes. We now show that a 12-kilobase full-length human dystrophin complementary DNA gene and a 6.3-kilobase Becker-like gene can be expressed in cultured cells and in vivo. When the human dystrophin expression plasmids are injected intramuscularly into dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, the human dystrophin proteins are present in the cytoplasm and sarcolemma of approximately 1% of the myofibres. Myofibres expressing human dystrophin contain an increased proportion of peripheral nuclei. The results indicate that transfer of the dystrophin gene into the myofibres of DMD patients could be beneficial, but a larger number of genetically modified myofibres will be necessary for clinical efficacy.\r"

Assembly of the spliceosome involves the stepwise binding of snRNPs and protein factors to the pre-mRNA through a poorly understood mechanism which probably involves specific RNA-RNA, RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Of particular interest are the interactions between snRNPs, which are likely to be important not only for assembly of the spliceosome but also for catalysis. U1 snRNP interacts with the 5' splice site and U2 snRNP with the branch site of the pre-mRNA; both of these interactions involve Watson-Crick base pairing. But very little is known about how other factors such as the U4/U6 and U5 snRNPs reach the spliceosome and function in splicing. Here we report evidence that U6 snRNA interacts directly with U2 snRNA by a mechanism involving base-pairing, and that this interaction can be necessary for splicing of a mammalian pre-mRNA in vivo.\r"

We have begun a genetic analysis of mammalian U2 snRNA by making second-site mutations in a suppressor U2 snRNA. Here we find that several mutations in the 5' end of U2 (nucleotides 3-8) are deleterious and that one of these can be rescued by compensatory base changes in the 3' end of U6 (nucleotides 92-95). The results demonstrate genetically that the base-pairing interaction between U2 (nucleotides 3-11) and U6 snRNA (nucleotides 87-95), originally proposed on the basis of psoralen photocrosslinking experiments, can influence the efficiency of mRNA splicing in mammals. The U2/U6 interaction in yeast, however, is fairly tolerant to mutation (D.J. Field and J.D. Friesen, personal communication), emphasizing the potential for facultative RNA interactions within the spliceosome.\r"

  ".U": "91351310\r", 
  ".W": "A vertebrate neurotoxin, alpha-latrotoxin, from black widow spider venom causes synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals. Although the mechanism of action of alpha-latrotoxin is not known, it does require binding of alpha-latrotoxin to a high-affinity receptor on the presynaptic plasma membrane. The alpha-latrotoxin receptor seems to be exclusively at the presynaptic plasmamembrane. Here we report that the alpha-latrotoxin receptor specifically binds to a synaptic vesicle protein, synaptotagmin, and modulates its phosphorylation. Synaptotagmin is a synaptic vesicle-specific membrane protein that binds negatively charged phospholipids and contains two copies of a putative Ca(2+)-binding domain from protein kinase C (the C2-domain), suggesting a regulatory role in synaptic vesicle fusion. Our findings suggest that a physiological role of the alpha-latrotoxin receptor may be the docking of synaptic vesicles at the active zone. The direct interaction of the alpha-latrotoxin receptor with a synaptic vesicle protein also suggests a mechanism of action for this toxin in causing neurotransmitter release.\r"

Intraerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum parasites can endocytose dextrans, protein A and an IgG2a antibody. Here we show that these macromolecules do not cross the erythrocyte or parasitophorous vacuolar membranes, but rather gain direct access to the aqueous space surrounding the parasite through a parasitophorous duct. Evidence for this structure includes visualization of membranes that are continuous between the parasitophorous vacuolar and erythrocyte membranes, and surface labelling of the parasite with fluorescent macromolecules under conditions that block endocytosis. The parasite can internalize by fluid-phase endocytosis macromolecules from the aqueous compartment surrounding it. Thus, surface antigens on trophozoites and schizonts should be considered as targets for antibody-directed parasiticidal agents.\r"

  ".U": "91351315\r", 
  ".W": "The calcium-independent neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM is expressed transiently during development in many tissues, including epithelia. The three naturally occurring principal isoforms of N-CAM differ in the way in which they associate with the membrane and in their cytoplasmic domains. These isoforms are generated by developmentally regulated alternative splicing of a single gene: the large cytoplasmic domain (ld) form (relative molecular mass 180,000 (Mr 180K] is specific for post-mitotic neurons; the 120K small cytoplasmic domain (ssd) and 140K small surface domain (sd) forms also occur on other cell types. One function of the different isoforms could be to specify cellular localization; for example, glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-membrane anchoring acts as a targeting signal for expression on the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. Neurons and epithelial cells may use similar mechanisms for polarizing their plasma membrane proteins. We have therefore investigated the targeting of GPI-anchored (ssd N-CAM, 120K) and transmembrane forms of N-CAM (sd N-CAM, 140K; ld N-CAM, 180K) by comparing the expression of each after transfection of the appropriate complementary DNAs into polarized epithelial cells. We find that isoforms with alternative modes of membrane association are targeted to different surfaces of polarized epithelial cells: ssd N-CAM is expressed on the apical surface, whereas sd and ld N-CAM are expressed on the basolateral surface. These results suggest that the different isoforms of N-CAM determine their own diverse cellular destinations. They also support the hypothesis that the GPI anchor acts as an apical targeting signal in epithelia.\r"

Four point mutations in the regulatory domain were assumed to be responsible for its oncogenicity and unusual preference for membrane localization. Here, we report that overexpression of the reported mutant PKC alpha complementary DNA in three fibroblast cell lines, including BALB/c 3T3, does not enable these cells to grow in soft agar or nude mice. In addition, this mutant PKC alpha form seems to be indistinguishable from the wild-type PKC alpha with respect to its dependence on cofactors, phorbol ester binding, subcellular distribution and its effects on growth and morphology. These results fail to confirm the previous study and indicate that overexpression of either the wild-type or the reported mutant form of PKC alpha does not transform rodent fibroblasts.\r"

WEE1Hu encodes a protein homologous to the S. pombe wee1+ and mik1+ (a functionally redundant sibling of wee1+) kinases and effectively rescues a wee1 mutation. We report here that overexpression of WEE1Hu in fission yeast generates very elongated cells as a result of inhibition of the G2-M transition in the cell cycle. In addition, we detected a 3-kilobase-long WEE1Hu messenger RNA in all the human cell lines we examined. We conclude that a wee1(+)-like gene exists and is expressed in human cells.\r"

One of the factors reacts with a sequence overlapping with a potential Sp1 recognition sequence in the promoter region of the gene, the other with a nearby ATF recognition sequence. We have identified two naturally occurring point mutations in these recognition sequences that cause hereditary retinoblastoma. The nuclear factors do not bind to the mutant sequences.

  ".U": "91351320\r", 
  ".W": "Inactivation of ion channels is important in the control of membrane excitability. For example, delayed-rectifier K+ channels, which regulate action potential repolarization, are inactivated only slowly, whereas A-type K+ channels, which affect action potential duration and firing frequency, have both fast and slow inactivation. Fast inactivation of Na+ and K+ channels may result from the blocking of the permeation pathway by a positively charged cytoplasmic gate such as the one encoded by the first 20 amino acids of the Shaker B (ShB) K+ channel. We report here that mutation of five highly conserved residues between the proposed membrane-spanning segments S4 and S5 (also termed H4) of ShB affects the stability of the inactivated state and alters channel conductance. One such mutation stabilizes the inactivated state of ShB as well as the inactivated state induced in the delayed-rectifier type K+ channel drk1 by the cytoplasmic application of the ShB N-terminal peptide. The S4-S5 loop, therefore, probably forms part of a receptor for the inactivation gate and lies near the channel's permeation pathway.\r"

But picornaviral mRNAs do not have a 5' terminal cap structure and are translated by internal ribosome binding. A cellular mRNA, encoding the immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein, can be translated in poliovirus-infected cells at a time when cap-dependent translation of host cell mRNAs is inhibited. We report here that the 5' leader of the binding protein mRNA can directly confer internal ribosome binding to an mRNA in mammalian cells, indicating that translation initiation by an internal ribosome-binding mechanism is used by eukaryotic mRNAs.\r"

All had been receiving glucocorticoid therapy for at least 1 year and required at least 5 mg/d of prednisolone (usually as 10 mg every 2 days). Thirty-one children completed the study. Bone density trends were measured in the spine by dual photon absorptiometry and in the forearm by single photon quantitative computed tomography at 3-monthly intervals. Trends (velocities) in bone and soft tissue growth were calculated. In the spine, bone growth correlated well with indices of soft tissue growth, but covariance analysis showed a significant advantage (P less than .007) of deflazacort when spinal bone mineral growth was compared to body surface area and weight. In part this was due to a temporary interruption in weight by children receiving deflazacort, whose gain in height was comparable with that of the prednisone group. Some children in both groups improved clinically and showed catch-up growth; in these children relative spinal bone mineral growth velocities were about twice those observed for height and weight. It is concluded that during the first year of deflazacort, their spinal bone mineral content at a level that was appropriate for their height and weight. Further observations are required to establish whether this advantage can be maintained subsequently. The anti-inflammatory effects of the two glucocorticoids appeared similar.\r"

Of 251 mother-neonate pairs, 122 were randomized to the control group and 129 to the intervention group. Outcome variables included health care utilization and results of maternal interviews. More mothers in the intervention group made a scheduled clinic visit in the first 30 days (P = .003), were more likely to seek some form of care at the clinic (P = .006), and tried to reach their physician by phone more often than the control group (P less than .001). There were no differences between the groups' emergency room utilization, the percent who received immunizations by 90 days of age, maternal knowledge of infant care, maternal anxiety, or postpartum depression. The intervention succeeded in improving some measures of health care utilization and results suggest that the relationship between the mother and clinician was strengthened.\r"

  ".W": "This study describes 56 infants who presented to the Emergency Department of The Children's Hospital of Denver during a 1-year period with an episode of excessive, prolonged crying, without fever and without a cause that was apparent to the parents. The final diagnoses included a broad array of conditions, of which 61% were considered serious. The history provided clues to the final diagnosis in 20% of cases. Physical examination revealed the final diagnosis in 41% and provided clues to the diagnosis in another 13%. Accurate diagnosis requires a thorough physical examination, which should include careful skin inspection underneath all clothing, palpation of all large bones, fluorescein staining of the cornea, eversion of eyelids, rectal examination, retinal examination, and thorough neurologic examination. \"Screening\" laboratory tests, except for urinalysis and urine culture, were of little help. This study indicates that for those patients in whom the physical examination is not diagnostic, the persistence of excessive crying after the initial examination predicts the presence of a serious cause. Those infants who cease crying before or during the initial assessment are unlikely to have a serious cause. Recommendations for a stepwise assessment are offered.\r"

A sample of 880 2- through 12-year-old children screened to exclude those with a history of sexual abuse were rated by their mothers using several questionnaire measures. The frequency of different behaviors varied widely, with more aggressive sexual behaviors and behaviors imitative of adults being rare. Older children (both boys and girls) were less sexual than younger children. Sexuality was found to be related to the level of general behavior problems, as measured by the Achenbach Internalizing and Externalizing T scores and to a measure of family nudity. It was not related to socioeconomic variables.\r"

Often, for families and physicians, the clinical dilemma is whether fatigue, arthritis/arthralgias, a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and tick exposure, but no evidence of erythema chronicum migrans, are sufficient to diagnose and treat Lyme disease. Patients with discordant ELISA and Western blot (WB) assay results for Borrelia burgdorferi were studied to determine whether there was sufficient clinical evidence to support a diagnosis of Lyme disease. Of 650 consecutive sera analyzed by ELISA in a laboratory within a 1-year period, 77 were subsequently tested by WB. The clinical data from these patients were then analyzed. The study population was divided into three groups: group 1 (positive ELISA, positive WB), group 2 (positive ELISA, negative WB), and group 3 (negative ELISA, negative WB). Findings included the following: (1) Patients with a strong clinical history of Lyme disease were usually positive by both WB and ELISA (group 1). (2) All patients with erythema chronicum migrans had both positive WB and ELISA tests. (3) Ninety-one percent of group 2 had a rheumatic or inflammatory condition other than Lyme disease. (4) A definite response to antibiotics occurred in 75% of patients wherein both ELISA and WB were positive but in only 11% of cases with a positive ELISA but a negative WB. (5) History of tick exposure and degree of fever were not significantly different among the three serologic groups, and thus they were not diagnostically helpful.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Based on these reviews, two clinicians and two pediatric radiologists rated the likelihood that the fracture was either accidental or due to child abuse. Long-bone fractures were strongly associated with abuse. This report focuses on the 39 children with either humeral or femoral fractures. Fourteen children had humerus fractures. Eleven were considered to be the result of child abuse, and 3 the result of accidents. The latter 3 were supracondylar elbow fractures in children who fell from a tricycle, a rocking horse, or downstairs. Humerus fractures other than supracondylar fractures were all found to be due to abuse. There were 25 femur fractures. Nine were found to be from abuse, 14 were found to be from accidents, and 2 could not be rated. Sixty percent of femur fractions in infants younger than 1 year of age were due to abuse. Although it is taught that femur fractures in young children are inflicted unless proven otherwise, in this study it was found that femur fractures often are accidental and that the femur can be fractured when the running child trips and falls.\r"

Postictal serum prolactin and cortisol levels were measured in 17 children with epilepsy, 23 with febrile seizures, and 10 with syncope or breath-holding spells. The levels were compared with those of 30 children with nonspecific fever, and 23 afebrile children served as control subjects. Significantly higher (P less than .01) prolactin levels (26.5 +/- 3.3 ng/mL, mean +/- SEM) were found in the epileptic group, compared with levels in children with febrile seizures (13.2 +/- 1.0 ng/mL), fever (11.2 +/- 0.9 ng/mL), syncope (7.3 +/- 0.9 ng/mL), and the control group (7.9 +/- 0.6 ng/mL). In contrast, serum cortisol levels were nonspecifically elevated in the epileptics and patients with febrile seizures or fever only. These findings suggest that elevated prolactin levels may be found after epileptic seizures and much less after febrile seizures, but not after breath-holding spells or syncopal events. Cortisol secretion appears to be nonselectively triggered by all stressful events, such as epileptic and febrile seizures, and fever. Elevated prolactin levels (greater than 15 ng/mL) associated with seizures may help in differentiating epileptic from febrile seizures or syncope.\r"

Few data are available on how to reduce the psychological morbidity that occurs in the presence of chronic childhood illness. An earlier report of a randomized controlled trial of a pediatric home care program demonstrated that this program, combining comprehensive biomedical and psychosocial care, reduced the short-term psychological morbidity of those receiving home care. However, data have not previously been available on whether the short-term improvement in adjustment is associated with any long-term benefits. This report presents long-term follow-up data collected 4 1/2 to 5 years after enrollment on 68% of the original sample. After this interval there were even larger differences between the experimental and control groups than those previously observed at 6 months and 1 year. This finding provides strong evidence that a comprehensive family-oriented outreach program for youngsters with chronic physical disorders can have long-term mental health benefits. It should encourage clinicians to develop similar programs and investigators to look for long-term effects of other interventions.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier reports of a randomized controlled trial of the Pediatric Home Care (PHC) program for children with chronic physical illness demonstrated overall benefits for the group enrolled in the PHC program. This paper examines which subgroups benefited most (relative to control subjects) and which benefited least from the PHC intervention. Prior to the randomized controlled trial, PHC served those with the most burdensome medical conditions from the families with the fewest coping resources. However, data from the randomized controlled trial (N = 219) show that these were not the subjects who benefited most. Maximal benefit was evident when illness burden was small, but coping resources were low (social, educational, financial, and personal). Analyses of covariance show that subjects in PHC with both low burden and low resources had consistently better outcomes than similar subjects in Standard Care. When the illness burden was similarly low, but resources were more abundant, those in Standard Care appear to have had better outcomes than those in PHC. For those whose illness burden was more severe, the results were mixed. These findings suggest that the conventional priority of allocating existing intervention resources to the medically most burdensome cases may not always be maximally beneficial. Those with less burdensome conditions may derive greater benefit relative to control subjects from an intervention than those with extreme needs. Both medical and social factors should enter into the decision regarding the allocation of scarce resources.\r"

The physicians gave very detailed information about diagnosis in 77% of cases whereas 39% of the parents recalled diagnostic information in great detail. Respective percentages for prognosis were 16 and 33; for current management (eg, investigation, therapy), 28 and 66; and for cause of illness, 16 and 18. The statistical significance of the differences between the very detailed information int he physician-parent conferences and in the parent-investigator interviews was, by category, less than .002, less than .041, less than .004, and not significant, respectively. Information in the respective categories was described as \"most helpful\" by 20%, 67%, 90%, and 8% of parents. All but one of the parents stated that they wanted the whole truth. Physician uncertainty in providing information was significantly associated with severity of illness. It is concluded that while parents wanted information in all categories, they paid most attention to that relating to management. Physician-parent discordances with respect to information about management, diagnosis, and prognosis suggest directions for future investigation of the optimal content of information for parents in this context.\r"

While a history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was a risk factor for rehospitalization (45% compared with 25% of those without bronchopulmonary dysplasia, P less than .05), preterm infants with no history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia still showed a 10-fold increase compared with control infants.

In addition, expenditures associated with transportation and child care presented an added substantial burden, although only the former were significantly higher for the VLBW infants. Clinicians may need to inquire specifically about the burden on family resources because, despite the economic burden and evidence of less social support, the parents of VLBW infants were less likely to perceive their child's care as having an impact on the family than were the parents of term children.\r"

Of the original 80 subjects, 49 were reassessed at a mean age of 74.7 months. As observed previously, physiotherapy until 1 year did not influence subsequent outcome in either normal or at-risk children. At-risk and normal children had similar mean developmental quotients at 6 years, but the locomotor score of at-risk children was significantly below that of normal children. Cerebral palsy occurred in 6 of 24 at-risk vs 0 of 25 normal subjects (P less than .01) and remedial therapy was recommended in 17 of 24 at-risk subjects vs 6 of 25 normal subjects (P less than .001).

Fifty mothers of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 50 control mothers, along with 21 children with ADHD and 20 control children, read a case vignette of an 8-year-old boy with ADHD and descriptions of the three treatment conditions. Subjects then rated the acceptability of each treatment. The mothers of children with ADHD were reassessed 3.5 months later, after experience with interventions for their children. Both ADHD and control families rated behavior modification as the most acceptable, methylphenidate as least acceptable, and the combined condition intermediate between the other two. At follow-up, there was a significant improvement in the acceptability of methylphenidate and the combined condition. The increased acceptability of methylphenidate at follow-up was related to increases in parents' knowledge about ADHD but not to the significant improvements that occurred in the children's hyperactive behavior.\r"

Twenty-seven HIV-infected children were individually matched with paired control subjects and followed up for 543 months (mean 19.4 +/- 11). Data collected were evaluated considering HIV-infected children both as a whole and as P1 and P2 patients according to Centers for Disease Control classification. During the observation period, 46 episodes of AOM were diagnosed in 15 HIV patients and 22 in 16 control children: 11 P1 had 27 AOM episodes vs 17 in 13 control children; 6 P2 had 19 AOM episodes vs 5 in 4 control children. Human immunodeficiency virus infection does not seem to modify the occurrence of AOM. Recurrent AOM (3 or more episodes in 6 months) was, however, significantly more common in P2 children. Amoxicillin, to which the bacteria isolated in P2 children were sensitive in vitro, cured 33 of 46 episodes in HIV-infected children compared with 20 of 22 in control children. Cure rate was similar in P1 children compared with control children but was significantly lower in P2 versus control children (47.3% vs 100%). Reasons for higher occurrence of failures in P2 children remain to be investigated.\r"

In 1977, 80% of homes had tap water temperatures greater than 54 degrees C. Mean temperature in 1988 was 50 degrees C compared with 61 degrees C in 1977. Both changes were significant compared with 1977 temperatures. Few people increased their heater temperature after installation. Eighteen burn victims were identified from July 1979 through May 1988, for an average admission rate of 2.4 per year, compared with 5.5 per year in the 1970s. Compared with the 1970s, total body surface area burned, mortality, grafting, scarring, and length of hospital stay were all reduced, while the likelihood that scald burns were the result of child abuse increased to 50%. Both education campaigns and legislation have resulted in significantly safer water temperatures. Further, this change seems to have resulted in a reduction in frequency, morbidity, and mortality of tap water burn injuries in children. Lower water heater settings proved acceptable to the consumer.\r"

  ".W": "The epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection was studied in 245 healthy children (between 3 and 20 years of age) who presented for day surgery at Arkansas Children's Hospital. H pylori infection was identified serologically using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the presence of IgG against the high molecular weight, cell-associated antigens of H pylori. Demographic information collected included age, gender, race, family income, type of housing, location of housing, water supply, health status, upper gastrointestinal symptoms, and keeping pets. One hundred eighty-nine white children and 56 black children were studied; 139 were boys and 106 were girls. The data were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. H pylori infection increased significantly with age (P less than .05). The frequency of H pylori infection was higher in blacks than whites (P less than .01), and this difference remained after adjusting for age, gender, and family income. Family income was used as a measure of socioeconomic class and was an important factor related to infection; the rate of acquisition of H pylori in those children with family income less than +5000/year was twice that of those with incomes greater than +75,000/year (P less than .001). There were no significant differences in H pylori infection related to gender, type of housing, location of housing, or source of water supply. It is concluded that the rate of acquisition of H pylori infection increases with age, is higher in blacks than whites, and is inversely related to socioeconomic class.\r"

The 27 survivors were followed up at a mean of 31 months. The outcome was unfavorable in 70%. The rate of epilepsy was 56%, of developmental delay 67%, and of cerebral palsy 63%. The etiology of seizures was an important factor influencing the outcome. Other clinical factors that showed a significant relationship with global or specific aspects of the neurologic outcome included the age at the onset of seizures, birth weight, and neurologic examination results. The EEG parameters that significantly predicted the neurologic outcome were interictal EEG background, increased seizure frequency, and decreased seizure duration.\r"

A national survey of children's hospitals determined the critical limits used for emergency notification of critical laboratory results. Mean low and high critical limits for children for the tests listed most frequently were as follows (millimoles per liter): glucose, 2.6 and 24.7; potassium, 2.8 and 6.4; calcium, 1.62 and 3.17; and sodium 121 and 156. For newborns, significantly different (P less than .01) critical limits were glucose, 1.8 and 18.2; and potassium, 7.8. Hematology mean critical limits for children included hemoglobin, 69 and 208 g/L; platelets, 53 and 916 x 10(9)/L; hematocrit, 0.20 and 0.62 L/L; and white blood cell counts, 2.1 and 42.9 x 10(9)/L. Critical limits for pH were 7.21 and 7.59; for PCO2, 21 and 66 mm Hg; and for PO2, 45 and 124 mm Hg. Important qualitative critical results included blasts on the blood smear and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid findings. In comparison with other medical centers, children's hospitals maintained tighter critical limits for surveillance of renal function, hemostasis dysfunction, and newborn hypokalemia. Use of these results to eliminate outliers can help reduce unnecessary statim notification and improve resource utilization for the acute diagnosis and treatment of critically ill newborns and children.\r"

Sera from the day of and 6 weeks postvaccination were tested for varicella antibody by gpELISA. Parents recorded clinical events occurring in the 6 weeks following vaccination. In the 132 evaluable children, the mean prevaccination titer was 0.3 gpELISA units for both groups. Sixty-three (97%) of the 65 receiving varicella vaccine by the subcutaneous route seroconverted compared with 67 (100%) of 67 immunized intramuscularly. Postvaccination geometric mean titer in the subcutaneous group was 6.9 +/- 7.0 gpELISA units and did not differ significantly from the geometric mean titer of 10.5 +/- 4.4 in the intramuscular group. Varicella vaccine was generally well tolerated by either route; 21% of both groups complained of reactions at the injection site and 7% had a varicella-like rash. Although varicella vaccine is recommended to be given subcutaneously, the results of this study indicate that inadvertent intramuscular administration of varicella vaccine is not reason for revaccination.\r"

Differences in the understanding of these concepts in healthy children vs children with a chronic illness have not been clearly delineated. This study included 49 children with a seizure disorder, 47 children with an orthopaedic condition, and 96 healthy children, all with normal intelligence and ranging in age from 5 to 16 years. It demonstrates systematic differences in children's general reasoning skills and in their understanding of concepts about illness causality and bodily functioning, as a function of their age and experience of illness. At all ages, children who had a condition with orthopaedic involvement reported less sophisticated general reasoning and concepts about illness than did healthy children; children with a seizure disorder reported similar general reasoning skills to those of healthy children, but considerably less sophisticated concepts about illness. Children's concepts about body functioning did not differ as a function of the presence of a chronic illness. When their different levels of general cognitive reasoning were statistically controlled, children with a chronic illness had somewhat more sophisticated concepts about bodily functioning than did healthy children. Differences in conceptual development among children with different types of illnesses lead to interesting speculations with regard to the effects of particular illness characteristics on children's cognitive development.\r"

The attempters differed significantly from control subjects on a large number of variables, particularly in the areas of substance abuse, depression, self-image, interpersonal relationships, communication patterns, family support, and problem behaviors. Only three items--the Beck Hopelessness Scale score, the SCL-90-R Positive Symptom Distress Index, and a history of suicidal ideation--differentiated the attempters from the at-risk adolescents. A discriminant analysis revealed that hopelessness and suicidal ideation were able to identify 93% of the suicide attempters.\r"

Validation of B-mode ultrasonography as a method for quantitative imaging of the extracranial carotid arteries has made it possible to identify risk factors for extracranial carotid atherosclerosis and its progression and to test pharmacologic agents for their ability to retard that progression. Extent of atherosclerosis in the extracranial carotid arteries has been shown to be a risk factor or \"marker\" for symptomatic CAD. In addition, CAD has been identified as an important predictor of progression of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis.\r"

Antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the number of episodes of acute otitis media in children at high risk for recurrent infection. There is no perfect antibiotic to prevent acute otitis media. However, the risks associated with the drugs described in this article are low. Prophylaxis with antibiotics does not prevent all episodes of acute otitis media but can reduce the number of episodes by 50%.\r"

Similar inhibition of IFN-inducible CAT activity was observed in cells that were cotransfected with the same reporter genes and plasmids expressing either the E1A 289- or 243-amino acid protein. These proteins also prevented the induction of CAT activity by IFN-gamma from a cotransfected HLA-DR alpha-CAT gene. Experiments with E1A mutants mapped the inhibitory activity to amino acid residues 38-65 of these proteins. In a HeLa cell line permanently expressing the E1A 289-amino acid protein, the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus was not inhibited by IFN-alpha, suggesting a global blockade of IFN responses. In accord with this theory, induction of 561, 1-8, and (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase mRNAs by IFN was blocked in these cells at the transcriptional level. The observed transcriptional inhibition could be attributed to the lack of formation of the crucial IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcriptional complex. As shown by mobility shift assays, this complex was not formed in the nuclear extracts of IFN-treated adenovirus-infected cells or IFN-treated E1A-producing cells. These nuclear extracts were deficient in both ISGF3 alpha and ISGF3 gamma subunits. However, they did not block the formation of ISGF3 complex from exogenously added components.\r"

Our experiments have shown that the synthetic analog binds and cleaves DNA, albeit without any sequence selectivity and with less efficiency than the natural compound. We propose that a key element in the sequence recognition process is the thiobenzoate ring present in the natural compound. We have demonstrated by one-dimensional NMR that there is direct hydrogen abstraction from DNA by calicheamicinone, with enhanced binding affinity contributed by the carbohydrate domain. The reduced efficiency of hydrogen abstraction from DNA by bound calicheamicinone, compared with the natural compound, implicates the carbohydrate moiety in positioning the drug for hydrogen abstraction.\r"

Interpolation of new data into a map is possible only when the length is known, including the distances from centromere and telomeres to the nearest markers. Current evidence on physical parameters including the reliable measurements of relative lengths from flow cytometry but only a crude estimate of genome size (3200 megabases).

We and others have reported varying biologic activity of different preparations of IGFBP-1 that appeared to have identical amino acid sequences and molecular sizes. This observation prompted us to determine whether IGFBP-1 undergoes posttranslational modifications. Immunoprecipitation was used to show that Chinese hamster ovary cells (transfected with a human IGFBP-1 cDNA construct) and human hepatoma (HepG2) cells secrete 32P-labeled IGFBP-1 following incubation with [32P]orthophosphate. Phospho amino acid analysis of 32P-labeled IGFBP-1 revealed only phosphoserine residues. A method was developed that could separate nonphosphorylated IGFBP-1 from four or five phosphorylated isoforms. Using this technique we demonstrated that human amniotic fluid and human fetal serum contain a large proportion of nonphosphorylated IGFBP-1, as well as phosphorylated forms. In contrast, HepG2 cells and human decidual cells secrete predominantly the phosphorylated isoforms. These observations suggest that IGFBP-1 is secreted as a phosphoprotein and is subsequently dephosphorylated in vivo. Binding studies showed that the phosphorylated IGFBP-1 secreted by HepG2 cells has a 6-fold higher affinity for IGF-I than it does after dephosphorylation. We conclude that IGFBP-1 is phosphorylated and that this phosphorylation is a physiologically important posttranslational modification.\r"

  ".U": "91352013\r", 
  ".W": "There are two types of cDNA clones (designated alpha 1 and alpha 2) encoding the alpha subunit of carp gonadotropin. These two cDNAs are derived from different genes and encode proteins that differ by seven amino acid residues (three in the signal peptide and four in the mature polypeptide). Expression of these two cDNAs in insect cells by recombinant baculovirus revealed that the alpha 1 subunit, after noncovalent association with the beta subunit, has the same potency as the native alpha subunit purified from the pituitary. In contrast, the alpha 2 subunit can associate with the beta subunit, but only to form an inactive gonadotropin. Competition of the alpha 2 subunit with the alpha 1 subunit for association with the beta subunit decreases the gonadotropin activity of the alpha/beta complex. In addition, both alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits are secreted into the culture medium by insect cells and have an apparent molecular mass approximately 5 kDa higher than that of the native alpha subunit. These results indicate that the insect cell-derived alpha 1 subunit is biologically active and that those four amino acid changes in the mature of alpha 2 protein affect the biological activity and thus provide valuable clues for the study of the structure-function relationship of the alpha subunit of glycoprotein hormones.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple D1 dopaminergic receptor subtypes have been postulated on the basis of pharmacological, biochemical, and genetic studies. We describe the isolation and characterization of a rat gene encoding a dopamine receptor that is structurally and functionally similar to the D1 dopamine receptor. The coding region, which is intronless, encodes a protein of 475 amino acids (Mr 52,834) with structural features that are consistent with receptors coupled to guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins. The expressed protein binds dopaminergic ligands and mediates stimulation of adenylyl cyclase with pharmacological properties similar to those of the D1 dopamine receptor. The gene encoding the human homologue of this receptor subtype is located to the short arm of chromosome 4 (4p16.3), the same region as the Huntington disease gene. In striking contrast to the previously cloned D1 receptor, little or no mRNA for the receptor described here was observed in striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and frontal cortex. High levels of mRNA for this receptor were found in distinct layers of the hippocampus, the mammillary nuclei, and the anterior pretectal nuclei, brain regions that have been shown to exhibit little or no D1 dopamine receptor binding. On the basis of its properties we propose that this dopamine receptor subtype be called D1B.\r"

  ".W": "A cAMP-inducible chloride permeability has been detected in mouse fibroblast (L cell) lines upon stable integration of a full-length cDNA encoding the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). As indicated by a Cl(-)-indicator dye, the Cl- permeability of the plasma membrane increases by 10- to 30-fold within 2 min after treatment of the cells with forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase. The properties of the conductance are similar to those described in secretory epithelial cells; the whole-cell current-voltage relationship is linear and there is no evidence of voltage-dependent inactivation or activation. In contrast, this cAMP-dependent Cl- flux is undetectable in the untransfected cells or cells harboring defective cDNA constructs, including one with a phenylalanine deletion at amino acid position 508 (delta F508), the most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the CFTR is a cAMP-dependent Cl- channel. The availability of a heterologous (nonepithelial) cell type expressing the CFTR offers an excellent system to understand the basic mechanisms underlying this CFTR-associated ion permeability and to study the structure and function of the CFTR.\r"

Tissue sections were investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy using specific polyclonal antisera against each receptor. The receptor originally identified and characterized in the oviduct strongly stained liver and ovary; localized staining was observed in the brain (especially endothelial cells). Staining of breast muscle and heart tissue occurred only in occasional interstitial cells. Antiserum against oviduct transferrin receptor did not stain erythrocytes, either from embryos or from mature animals. On the other hand, the antiserum directed against the embryonic erythrocyte receptor stained embryonic erythrocytes; it did not stain any other tissues. The fluorescence microscopy observations were confirmed by Western blot analysis. The strong staining of oviduct, liver, and ovary suggests a major role for the oviduct transferrin receptor in oogenesis.\r"

In two assays, formation of initiation complexes and transcription in vitro, the RNA polymerase II-associated proteins behaved identically to a fraction containing transcription factors IIE and IIF. Both fractions greatly stabilized the association of polymerase with the promoter and were required for the formation of complete initiation complexes. By using the DNA-cleaving reagent phenanthroline.copper in footprinting reactions, the RNA polymerase II-associated proteins were shown to be required for a DNA conformation change near the initiation site of the promoter. Based on similarity to the prokaryotic transcription complex, this conformation change is likely to represent a transition from a closed to an open complex.\r"

Recently, we have shown that ES cells can produce all of the cells of the developing fetus after aggregation with developmentally compromised tetraploid embryos. Completely ES cell-derived embryos die perinatally, but the liver of these embryos is a source of entirely ES cell-derived hematopoietic progenitors. We have taken 14- to 15-day fetal liver cells from ES cell-tetraploid chimeras and reconstituted the hematopoietic system of lethally irradiated adult recipient mice. ES cell-derived hematopoietic stem cells were capable of long-term (greater than 6 months) repopulation of irradiated recipients, and all hematopoietic cell lineages analyzed (erythrocytes, T cells, mast cells, and macrophages) were derived exclusively from ES cells in such recipients. Thus, ES cells retain the capacity to differentiate into all hematopoietic cell types after prolonged passage in culture. This approach should provide a direct route to the production of mice whose hematopoietic cells carry genetic alterations that would be lethal if passed through the germ line.\r"

  ".W": "A distinctive variable region 14-positive (V14+) alpha chain (V alpha 14+) of the T-cell antigen receptor is predominantly expressed in multiple mouse subspecies. The V alpha 14 family has two members, V alpha 14.1 and V alpha 14.2, which differ by only three amino acids at positions 50-52. Based on the EcoRI restriction fragment length polymorphism of the gene encoding V alpha 14, mice can be divided into three groups: type I with an 11.2-kilobase (kb) fragment, type II with a 2.0-kb fragment, and type III with the 2.0-kb and 11.2-kb fragments. Usage of V alpha 14-J alpha 281, where J alpha 281 is an alpha-chain joining segment, with a one-base N region dominates at the level of 0.02-1.5% of alpha chains in all laboratory strains, Mus musculus castaneus, and Mus musculus domesticus but not in Mus musculus molossinus, Mus musculus musculus, and Mus spicilegus samples. The preferential V alpha 14-J alpha 281 expression seems to be due to positive selection because the V-J junctional region is always glycine, despite the ability of the V alpha 14 gene to associate with J alpha other than J alpha 281. As V alpha 14-J alpha 281 expression is independent of known major histocompatibility complex antigens, including H-2, TLA, Qa, and HMT, the selecting ligand must be a monomorphic molecule of the mouse, expressed in a subspecies-specific manner. Additional observations, such as the expression of homogeneous V alpha 14-J alpha 281 in athymic mice, suggest that the positive selection of V alpha 14+ T cells occurs extrathymically.\r"

By using deletion and mutation analyses, we have identified a cis-acting \"repressor\" element located immediately upstream of the proximal Sp1 binding site in the ADA gene promoter. This repressor element was localized to a binding site for the immediate-early, serum-responsive, DNA binding factor Zif268. This Zif268 binding site partially overlaps a binding site for the general transcription activator Sp1. Disruption of the Zif268 binding site without disturbing the Sp1 binding motif abolished Zif268 binding and resulted in significantly elevated promoter function. Conversely, disruption of the proximal consensus Sp1 binding motif without disturbing the Zif268 binding site resulted in a loss of Sp1 binding at that region and greatly reduced promoter activity. Our results suggest that one function of Zif268 may be to down-regulate this type of mammalian gene promoter by competing with Sp1 for binding to the overlapping binding motif.\r"

  ".W": "There is controversy as to whether deletional rearrangement occurs between the IgM and IgE switch regions (S mu and S epsilon, respectively) during switching to the IgE isotype. We have addressed the issue by stimulating normal human B cells, sorted for lack of expression of surface IgE, to produce IgE by infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the presence of interleukin 4 (IL-4). Genomic DNA was amplified for S mu/S epsilon switch junction fragments by utilizing the nested-primer polymerase chain reaction. Switch junction fragments were amplified from B cells infected with EBV in the presence of IL-4 but not from B cells infected with EBV alone. The DNA sequence of these \"switch fragments\" revealed direct joining of S mu to S epsilon in each case. The recombination sites within S mu were clustered within 900 base pairs at the 5' end of the switch region, suggesting that there are \"hot spots\" for recombination within S mu. The S epsilon recombination sites were scattered throughout the S epsilon region. These findings indicate that IL-4-induced isotype switching to IgE production in human B cells is accompanied by DNA rearrangements with joining of S mu to S epsilon.\r"

Eleven human T-cell clones (9 alpha beta TCR and 2 gamma delta TCR clones) of different antigenic specificities were tested for their capacity to proliferate in response to toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) and two SEs, SEA and SEB. In the absence of accessory cells, only 4 alpha beta TCR clones were stimulated to proliferate, each by a single SE, and to mobilize intracellular free Ca2+ in response to that SE, events indicative of TCR engagement and, presumably, recognition restricted by the beta-chain variable region. In the presence of accessory cells, each of the 11 T-cell clones was stimulated to proliferate by any one of the three SEs tested. This apparently TCR-unrestricted SE-mediated polyclonal proliferation of T-cell clones occurred in the absence of an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ and was not dependent on the presence of MHC class II expression on accessory cells. In contrast, SE-mediated polyclonal proliferation did not occur in 3 alpha beta TCR clones derived from an MHC class II-deficient patient. Furthermore, all of the three SEs induced the proliferation of 4 natural-killer-cell clones, suggesting that expression of TCR/CD3 complex is not essential for SE-mediated polyclonal proliferation of activated lymphocytes. These results indicate that MHC class II molecules transduce activation signals to human T- and natural-killer-cell clones.\r"

LECAM-1 is rapidly shed while Mac-1 expression is dramatically increased upon neutrophil activation, suggesting functionally distinct roles for these molecules. Using intravital video microscopy, we have compared the effect of antibodies against LECAM-1 and CD18 on leukocyte interactions with rabbit mesenteric venules. Anti-LECAM-1 monoclonal antibody and its Fab fragments inhibited initial reversible leukocyte rolling along the vascular wall. Anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody had no effect on rolling but prevented subsequent firm attachment of leukocytes to venular endothelium. These results support a two-step model of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions: reversible rolling mediated in part by LECAM-1 facilitates leukocyte recruitment by the local microenvironment and precedes activation-dependent firm attachment involving beta 2 integrins.\r"

The cloned cell lines express F4/80 molecules, exert phagocytosis, have nonspecific esterase activity, and express class II molecules after interferon gamma activation. The macrophage clones are diploid and their karyotypes have remained stable for greater than 3 years in culture. After the macrophage clones were activated, their pattern of cytokine production was investigated. Functional heterogeneity in cytokine transcription was demonstrated: one of six liposaccharide-activated macrophages was unable to transcribe interleukin 1 alpha, whereas all of the liposaccharide-activated clones were able to transcribe tumor necrosis factor alpha. Interleukin 6 production was detected in three of six clones. The production of nitrite and tumor necrosis factor alpha as effector molecules of cytotoxicity was detected in all clones, thus showing that a single macrophage can exert more than one cytotoxic mechanism. The results indicate that immortalized and cloned macrophages have a differentially regulated expression of cytokine genes, adding further evidence for the existence of functional heterogeneity among cloned macrophages. This heterogeneity seems to derive from differentiation-related mechanisms rather than from external constraints.\r"

  ".W": "Using differential radiation sensitivity of components of mouse embryonal thymus, an in vitro method for studying T-cell differentiation from hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the G0 phase was established. Intrathymic T-cell precursors present in embryonal thymus were found to be quite radioresistant (up to 20 Gy), and consequently 25-Gy-irradiated embryonal thymic lobes were used. Thymic lobes (25-Gy irradiated) taken from mouse fetuses (gestation day 15) were placed in Millipore-HA culture plates supported on squares of gelatin foam sponge in 24-well culture plates in which neonatal thymus stromal cells were cultured. HSCs (10(5) cells per well) in the G0 phase were added to these thymic lobes and cocultured at 37 degrees C in a 5% CO2/95% air incubator. Half the culture medium was changed every week. After 3 weeks, a large number of colonies had formed. Immunohistochemical studies and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses revealed that the colonizing cells regularly develop and exhibit surface markers characteristic of T cells (Thy-1, IL-2R, L3T4, Lyt-2, etc.). In situ hybridization analyses revealed that mRNA expression for T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chains occurred within colonizing cells. Using a monoclonal antibody (F23.1), expression of TCR beta-chain variable domain (V beta 8) on the surface of these developing T cells was demonstrated. These cells responded to interleukin 2 and/or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, indicating functional T cells. This method will be useful in studying T-cell differentiation pathways from pluripotent HSCs and in clarifying the mechanisms involved in negative and positive selection of T cells within the thymus.\r"

The agonists kainate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxasolepropionic acid define a class of glutamate receptors termed kainate receptors. We have isolated and sequenced a human glutamate receptor (GluHI) cDNA and determined the chromosomal localization of its gene. The DNA sequence of GluHI would encode a 907-amino acid protein that has a 97% identity to one of the rodent kainate receptor subunits. Many of the changes between the predicted amino acid sequence of GluHI and the most similar rodent kainate receptor (GluRI) occur in a region of the protein encoded in rodents by an alternatively spliced exon. The extreme conservation between the human and rat kainate receptor subunits suggests that a similar gene family will encode human kainate receptors. The GluHI mRNA is widely expressed in human brain. The human gene encoding the GluHI subunit is located at 5q33. While the GluHI gene is not located near a chromosomal region associated with any human neurogenetic disorders, the homologous region on mouse chromosome 11 contains the sites of five neurologic mutations.\r"

We have used DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction to study the PLP gene coding regions from 17 patients in 15 unrelated families with similar Pelizaeus-Merzbacher phenotype. In one case amplification of peripheral nerve PLP/DM20 cDNAs revealed that a silent T----C transition was unrelated to the disease. In one family a nonsilent mutation was identified that leads to a phenylalanine substitution for valine-218 in PLP/DM20 proteins. We investigated the inheritance of the mutant allele in 19 subjects of this four-generation family and found a strict cosegregation of the Phe218 substitution with transmission and expression of the disease. The effect of the Val218----Phe mutation is discussed in the frame of a recently suggested topological model of PLP/DM20, according to which Val218 is part of an extracellular loop that connects the last two of four membrane-spanning alpha-helices.\r"

We used selective ligands for the AT1 and AT2 types of AII receptors to investigate the expression of functional receptor subtypes in astrocyte cultures and neuron cultures from 1-day-old (neonatal) rat brain. In astrocyte cultures, competition of 125I-labeled AII (125I-AII) specific binding with AT1 (DuP753) or AT2 (PD123177, CGP42112A, [Phe(p-NH2)6]AII) selective receptor ligands revealed a potency series of AII greater than DuP753 much greater than CGP42112A greater than [Phe(p-NH2)6]AII greater than PD123177. These results suggest a predominance of the AT1 receptor subtype in neonatal astrocytes. Also, in astrocyte cultures, AII stimulated increases in inositolphospholipid hydrolysis that were significantly reduced by the AT1 receptor antagonist DuP753 but not altered by the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123177. In neonatal neuron cultures, competition of 125I-AII specific binding with the above ligands revealed a potency series of CGP42112A = AII greater than [Phe(p- NH2)6]AII greater than PD123177 much greater than DuP753. 125I-AII specific binding to neonate neuronal cultures was reduced 73-84% by 1 microM PD123177, and the residual 125I-AII specific binding was eliminated by DuP753. Also, in neuron cultures, AII induced decreases in basal cGMP that were completely blocked by PD123177 or CGP42112A but not by DuP753. Our results suggest that astrocyte cultures from neonatal rat brains contain predominantly AT1 receptors that are coupled to a stimulation of inositophospholipid hydrolysis. In contrast, neuron cultures from neonatal rat brain contain mostly AT2 receptors that are coupled to a reduction in basal cGMP levels, but a smaller population of AT1 receptors is also present in these neurons.\r"

However, before the animals were 4 months old, visual responsiveness was found in inferior temporal cortex only in awake monkeys performing a behavioral task and not in anesthetized ones, suggesting that extraretinal factors profoundly influence function in \"association\" cortex in developing as well as mature animals.\r"

  ".U": "91352031\r", 
  ".W": "The pineal hormone melatonin is thought to mediate the effects of the pineal gland on seasonal reproduction by altering the release of gonadotropins. The mechanism by which melatonin controls gonadotropin secretion has been obscure. Recently, labeled 2-iodomelatonin was used to localize melatonin receptors in brain by radioautography. The highest concentration of melatonin receptors was found in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland of mammals. Pituitary hormones, in particular luteinizing hormone (LH), have been localized in cells of the pars tuberalis. Consequently, we hypothesized that melatonin might act on its receptors in the pars tuberalis to alter the release of LH. It would then be possible for this LH to diffuse into the overlying median eminence, there to alter the release of LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) from the axons of the LHRH neurons. To evaluate this hypothesis, we incubated median eminence-pars tuberalis tissue from male rats in vitro. After preincubation in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 30 min, test substances were added to fresh medium and the incubation was continued for 30 min. LHRH or LH released into the medium was measured by radioimmunoassay. Melatonin induced a dose-related release of LHRH with the maximum response at the greatest concentration tested (1 microM). This concentration of melatonin also significantly reduced the release of LH into the medium. The increased release of LHRH induced by melatonin (10 microM) was completely blocked by the addition of LH (50 ng/ml), which by itself had no significant effect on LHRH release. Rat LH antiserum (final dilution, 1:1800) significantly elevated LHRH output, whereas normal rabbit serum at a similar dilution had no effect. Finally, LHRH (0.1 microM) induced a significant release of LH from median eminence-pars tuberalis tissue that was completely blocked by melatonin (10 microM). The results support the hypothesis that LH released from the pars tuberalis diffuses to the LHRH terminals in the median eminence to suppress LHRH release. Melatonin acts on its receptors in the pars tuberalis to inhibit LH release, thereby stimulating the release of LHRH from its terminals in the median eminence. The negative short-loop feedback of LH inhibits basal LHRH release in vitro since antiserum against LH increased LHRH release. The results suggest a concept concerning the mechanism by which melatonin can affect the release of pituitary hormones from the pars tuberalis. It is likely that these pituitary hormones diffuse into the median eminence to modify the release of hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting peptides, thereby altering plasma pituitary hormone concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the role of kinase-mediated mechanisms in regulating mammalian cell proliferation, we determined the effects of the general protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine on the proliferation of a series of nontransformed and transformed cultured rodent and human cells. Levels of staurosporine as low as 1 ng/ml prevented nontransformed cells from entering S phase (i.e., induced G1 arrest), indicating that kinase-mediated processes are essential for commitment to DNA replication in normal cells. At higher concentrations of staurosporine (50-75 ng/ml), nontransformed mammalian cells were arrested in both G1 and G2. The period of sensitivity of nontransformed human diploid fibroblasts to low levels of the drug commenced 3 hr later than the G0/G1 boundary and extended through the G1/S boundary. Interference with activity of the G1-essential kinase(s) caused nontransformed human cells traversing mid-to-late G1 at the time of staurosporine addition to be \"set back\" to the initial staurosporine block point, suggesting the existence of a kinase-dependent \"G1 clock\" mechanism that must function continuously throughout the early cycle in normal cells. The initial staurosporine block point at 3 hr into G1 corresponds to neither the serum nor the amino acid restriction point. In marked contrast to the behavior of nontransformed cells, neither low nor high concentrations of staurosporine affected G1 progression in transformed cultures; high drug concentrations caused transformed cells to be arrested solely in G2. These results indicate that kinase-mediated regulation of DNA replication is lost as the result of neoplastic transformation, but the G2-arrest mechanism remains intact.\r"

In plasma, stomach, heart, and intestine, the [S]oligonucleotide was degraded by only 15%, whereas in the kidney and liver degradation was about 50% in 48 hr. The surprising observation was made that chain length extension of administered [S]oligonucleotide occurred in kidney, liver, and intestine.

ADH isozymes encoded by these genes are grouped in three distinct classes in terms of their enzymological properties. A moderate structural similarity is observed between the members of different classes. We isolated an additional member of the ADH gene family by means of cross-hybridization with the ADH2 (class I) cDNA probe. cDNA clones corresponding to this gene were derived from PCR-amplified libraries as well. The coding sequence of a 368-amino-acid-long open reading frame was interrupted by introns into eight exons and spanned approximately 17 kilobases on the genome. The gene contains a glucocorticoid response element at the 5' region. The transcript was detected in the stomach and liver. The deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame showed about 60% positional identity with known human ADHs. This extent of homology is comparable to interclass similarity in the human ADH family. Thus, the newly identified gene, which is designated ADH6, governs the synthesis of an enzyme that belongs to another class of ADHs presumably with a distinct physiological role.\r"

To assess the role of DNA ligase function in the etiology of BS, we have cloned the DNA ligase I cDNA from normal human cells by a PCR strategy using degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on conserved regions of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe DNA ligase genes. Human DNA ligase I cDNAs from normal and BS cells complemented a S. cerevisiae DNA ligase mutation, and protein extracts prepared from S. cerevisiae transformants expressing normal and BS cDNA contained comparable levels of DNA ligase I activity. DNA sequencing and Northern blot analysis of DNA ligase I expression in two BS human fibroblast lines representing each of the two aberrant DNA ligase I molecular phenotypes demonstrated that this gene was unchanged in BS cells. Thus, another factor may be responsible for the observed reduction in DNA ligase I activity associated with this chromosomal breakage syndrome.\r"

The codons corresponding to His-295, His-299, or Glu-318 were replaced by codons encoding tyrosine, tyrosine, and glutamine, respectively. The mutated cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the three mutated proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity. None of these mutants contained significant amounts of zinc, as determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, and all of them were practically devoid of both LTA4 hydrolase and peptidase enzyme activities. Nevertheless, the mutated proteins could be positively identified by their immunoreactivities with an antiserum for human LTA4 hydrolase in immunoblot analysis. Site-directed mutagenesis was also carried out on human LTA4 hydrolase cDNA. Codons encoding His-295, His-299, and Glu-318 were replaced by ones encoding tyrosine, leucine, and alanine, respectively, and the three mutants were expressed in E. coli. The LTA4 hydrolase activities of the total soluble proteins produced in these expressions were less than 10% of that obtained for bacteria harboring nonmutated cDNA. In agreement with earlier predictions, our experimental data demonstrate that His-295, His-299, and Glu-318 constitute the three ligands of the intrinsic zinc atom in LTA4 hydrolase. Additionally, the combined loss of enzyme activities and zinc content in the purified mutated mouse proteins, emphasizes the critical role of the zinc atom for catalysis, whereas the virtually identical chromatographic behaviors of the mutated and nonmutated mouse LTA4 hydrolase proteins suggest that the metal is of limited importance for the maintenance of the enzyme tertiary structure.\r"

By RNase protection analysis we have analyzed the expression of FGFR-1 mRNA in various tissues and cell lines and demonstrated that all of the cell lines studied expressed at least two different forms of the FGFR-1 at similar levels. Although muscle and heart express forms having either two [FGFR-1 short (FGFR-1S)] or three [FGFR-1 long (FGFR-1L)] Ig-like domains, the developing brain and adult brain express only mRNA encoding the longer form. The two forms of the receptor were characterized further by stably introducing expression vectors expressing them into Rat-2 fibroblasts and FDC-P1 myeloid cells. Treatment of the transfected Rat-2 cells with acidic FGF (aFGF) or basic FGF (bFGF) resulted in focus formation. The transformed phenotype was observed even without addition of ligand after growth in culture for greater than 2 months. Cross-linking of 125I-labeled bFGF (125I-bFGF) to Rat-2 cells expressing either FGFR-1L or FGFR-1S yielded two similar complexes of 150 and 110 kDa. Although Rat-2 cells expressing FGFR-1L yielded similar complexes with 125I-labeled aFGF (125I-aFGF), only the 150-kDa complex was formed with cells expressing FGFR-1S. The 150-kDa complex was also observed when 125I-aFGF or 125I-bFGF was cross-linked to FDC-P1 cells expressing FGFR-1L. Significantly, these complexes were only observed when heparin was present in the cross-linking reaction. FDC-P1 cells expressing FGFR-1 bound aFGF and bFGF with high affinity but only in the presence of heparin. The factor dependence of these cells could be switched from interleukin 3 to FGF in the presence of heparin.\r"

The availability of growth factors and biomolecular techniques have prompted a renewed attempt to find evidence of virus infection in these patients. We report here the successful culture of blood lymphocytes of 17 patients with mycosis fungoides and 1 patient with the Sezary syndrome. The cells of 2 additional patients failed to grow after 4-6 weeks in vitro. Ultrastructural analysis of the cultures showed an abundance of HTLV-like particles in the specimens of 18 of the 20 patients. Preliminary immunohistochemical studies carried out with various antisera directed against HTLV-I and the polymerase chain reaction utilizing a probe for a conserved region of the pol gene of HTLV-I were positive on only a portion of the specimens.

Several lines of evidence implicate both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and c-myc activation in the pathogenesis of a major subset of these tumors. These observations prompted our investigation of interactions among EBV, c-myc, and HIV in primary B cells. We show that nonimmortalized peripheral B lymphocytes from EBV-seropositive, HIV-seronegative donors can be infected by HIV and that a subset of these lymphocytes become transformed. Malignant transformation was documented by several criteria. These cells displayed altered growth properties, propagating in 1% serum and cloning in soft agar, and formed invasive tumors of Burkitt lymphoma phenotype after subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Such cells revealed marked enhancement of EBV DNA and RNA and of endogenous c-myc transcripts and protein. HIV-1 infection of already immortalized B-cell lines led to a similar upregulation of EBV and c-myc transcripts. These data indicate that HIV has properties of a transforming retrovirus, as it mediates two events linked to B-cell neoplasia: deregulation of c-myc and activation of EBV. They also raise the possibility of a role for HIV, apart from induction of immune suppression, in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\r"

The construct was modeled after sporadic in-frame deletions of collagen genes that cause synthesis of shortened pro alpha chains that associate with normal pro alpha chains and thereby cause degradation of the shortened and normal pro alpha chains through a process called procollagen suicide. The gene construct was used to prepare five lines of transgenic mice expressing the minigene. A large proportion of the mice expressing the minigene developed a phenotype of a chondrodysplasia with dwarfism, short and thick limbs, a short snout, a cranial bulge, a cleft palate, and delayed mineralization of bone. A number of mice died shortly after birth. Microscopic examination of cartilage revealed decreased density and organization of collagen fibrils. In cultured chondrocytes from the transgenic mice, the minigene was expressed as shortened pro alpha 1(II) chains that were disulfide-linked to normal mouse pro alpha 1(II) chains. Therefore, the phenotype is probably explained by depletion of the endogenous mouse type II procollagen through the phenomenon of procollagen suicide.\r"

Both genes give similar nervous system expression patterns and map to an indistinguishable site at 33F on the cytological map. Transcription of the genes is first observed in the cellular blastoderm. In the course of embryonic development, expression is observed in the neuroectoderm, with subsets of neuroblasts in the procephalic and germband central nervous system as well as a subset of peripheral nervous system elements.

W. (1983) in Excitotoxins, eds. Fuxe, K., Roberts, P. J. & Schwartch, R. (Wenner-Gren International Symposium Series, Macmillan, London), Vol. 39, pp. 82-96; and Rothman, S. M. & Olney, J. W. (1986) Ann. Neurol. 19, 105-111] predicts an imbalance between excitation and inhibition, which occurs probably as a result of hyperactivity in afferent pathways or impaired inhibition. In the present study, we investigated whether the enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated (GABAergic) inhibition of neurotransmission by blocking the GABA-metabolizing enzyme, GABA transaminase, could influence the histopathological and/or the behavioral outcome in this epilepsy model. We demonstrate that the loss of pyramidal cells and hilar somatostatin-containing neurons can be abolished by enhancing the level of synaptically released GABA, and that the preservation of hippocampal structure is accompanied by a significant sparing of spatial memory as compared with placebo-treated controls. These results suggest that enhanced GABAergic inhibition can effectively block the pathophysiological processes that lead to excitotoxic cell death and, as a result, protect the brain from seizure-induced cognitive impairment.\r"

  ".W": "Nuclear extracts from teniposide (VM-26)-resistant sublines of the human leukemic cell line CCRF-CEM have decreased levels of DNA topoisomerase II catalytic activity and decreased capacity to form drug-stabilized covalent protein-DNA complexes. The ATP concentration required for equivalent activity in a DNA-unknotting assay is 2- to 8-fold higher in nuclear extracts from drug-resistant cell lines as compared with the parental line. When adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate is substituted for ATP in complex-formation assays, no significant change is seen with drug-sensitive cells, but a 50-65% reduction is seen with VM-26-resistant cells. Collectively, these results indicate that an alteration in ATP binding may be involved in the resistance phenotype. Therefore, we identified regions of the topoisomerase II sequence that conform to previously identified nucleotide-binding sites. Starting with cDNA as the template we determined the sequence of the topoisomerase II mRNA surrounding these sites by sequencing DNA fragments produced by the polymerase chain reaction. In the region corresponding to the consensus B ATP-binding sequence described by Walker et al. [Walker, J. E., Saraste, M., Runswick, M. J. & Gay, N. J. (1982) EMBO J. 1, 945-951], the cDNA from the two VM-26-resistant sublines contained an altered sequence having a G----A base change. This base substitution results in the replacement of the conserved arginine at position 449 with a glutamine. Hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides confirmed the presence of both the normal and the altered sequence in the resistant cell lines, whereas only the normal sequence was found in the sensitive CEM cells. A chemical mismatch cleavage procedure for the detection of mispaired bases in DNA duplexes identified no other alterations in the 5' third of the mRNA coding sequence, which contains the complete ATP-binding domain of topoisomerase II. The presence of mRNA encoding topoisomerase II with Gln449 correlates both with the presence of a topoisomerase II protein whose interaction with ATP is altered and with increased resistance to the cytotoxicity of VM-26.\r"

Factors secreted by the motor neuron may mediate activity-independent regulation, including the postnatal switch from alpha 2 beta gamma delta (embryonic type) to alpha 2 beta epsilon delta (adult type) receptors. We have investigated the effect of putative trophic factors, agents affecting second-messenger systems, and muscle activity on the levels of acetylcholine receptor subunit mRNAs in primary mouse muscle cultures. We found that ARIA (acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity), a 42-kDa glycoprotein purified on the basis of its ability to increase the synthesis of acetylcholine receptors in chick myotubes, increases epsilon-subunit mRNA levels up to 10-fold. In addition, ARIA stimulated alpha-, gamma-, and delta-subunit mRNA levels 2-fold but had no effect on the expression of the beta-subunit gene. These effects of ARIA were independent of muscle activity, and they were not mimicked by calcitonin gene-related peptide nor by thyroxine, forskolin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, the calcium ionophore A23187, basic fibroblast growth factor, or transforming growth factor beta. Based on these data, we suggest that ARIA may act at the mammalian neuromuscular junction to induce adult-type acetylcholine receptors.\r"

  ".W": "We provide biochemical evidence for the existence of a transcriptional intermediary factor (TIF) in HeLa whole-cell extracts (WCE) that is distinct from the basic transcription factors and that is required for transcriptional stimulation by the chimeric acidic activator GAL-VP16. We have fractionated HeLa WCE by heparin-agarose chromatography. Of transcriptionally active fractions eluting in a step between 0.24 and 0.6 M KCl, the initial fractions are refractory to GAL-VP16 stimulation, whereas subsequent fractions are strongly stimulated by the activator. Aliquots of GAL-VP16-responsive fractions efficiently complement refractory fractions for transcriptional stimulation. Aliquots of responsive fractions are also far more efficient than those of refractory fractions in overcoming transcriptional inhibition that is brought about by high concentrations of GAL-VP16. Experiments performed with heat-treated WCE support the idea that HeLa cells contain a TIF that is essential for GAL-VP16 stimulation, but that is not required for basal transcription. Addition of recombinant yeast or human transcription factor TFIID (rTFIIDY and rTFIIDH, respectively) to a WCE heated at 48 degrees C for 15 min restores basal transcription, but in neither case is the reconstituted system activated by GAL-VP16. However, a 45 degrees C heat-treated WCE reconstituted with either rTFIIDH or rTFIIDY is stimulated by GAL-VP16, suggesting that a HeLa TIF can be selectively inactivated by heating at 48 degrees C, but not at 45 degrees C. Interestingly, a TFIID fraction partially purified from HeLa cell extracts, but not rTFIIDH, efficiently relieves transcriptional inhibition by GAL-VP16, suggesting that there may be an association between TIF(s) and TFIID and, moreover, that TIF(s) may be the direct target of the acidic domain of GAL-VP16. In summary, our results support the existence of a TIF that is not essential for basal transcription but that is required to mediate the stimulatory activity of the acidic activator GAL-VP16.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin, traditionally regarded as a metabolic hormone, also can potently stimulate growth and differentiation in many cell types. To study further the potential role of insulin during early embryogenesis, we have used the amphibian Xenopus laevis, a versatile model of vertebrate development. Using (i) nucleotide sequences of two previously cloned cDNAs that correspond to two different nonallelic Xenopus insulin genes (both of which are expressed in the adult pancreas) and (ii) a modification of the highly sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method developed in our laboratory, designated RNA template-specific PCR (RS-PCR), we now find that mRNAs for both Xenopus insulins I and II are present in mature (stage VI) oocytes but not in less-mature oocytes (stages I and IV) or in unfertilized eggs. The Xenopus insulin II gene is differentially expressed during early neurulation (stage 13), while only the insulin I gene is expressed at stage 21, when the neural tube is closing and cephalization is beginning. During later stages (i.e., stage 26) there is a region in the head that appears to be transcribing only the insulin I gene, while mRNAs for both insulins I and II are present in the body region. These findings show that the two nonallelic insulin genes are expressed differentially in Xenopus embryos in a stage- and region-specific manner; because appropriate receptors are also present, we suggest a role for insulin during early nervous system development well before the emergence of pancreatic beta cells.\r"

Their nucleotide sequences and putative secondary structures were determined in order to understand the nature of the elements involved in intramolecular recombination. Multiple deletions, involving the same portion of Neurospora mtDNA, were identified in six independently isolated mutants. A 9-nucleotide repeat element, CCCCNCCCC, was found to be involved in these and other Neurospora mitochondrial recombination events. The repeat elements were clustered as hot spots on the Neurospora mtDNA and were associated with palindromic DNA sequences. The palindromes have a potential to generate hairpin structures. A much lower free energy of the putative hairpins at the 5' end of the recombination site, and the possible formation of non-B-DNA structure by polypyrimidine tracks, may be important in the initiation of recombination. Using PCR, we found low levels of a specific mitochondrial deletion in certain Neurospora mutants. Their presence in low amounts in a population with a much larger number of normal mtDNA is unexpected. Contrary to earlier belief, this finding supports the view that deleted, smaller DNA molecules are not always suppressive relative to normal mtDNAs.\r"

CD1-2-3-4-7+8-45+ pro-T cells isolated from postnatal thymi via immunoselection with a panel of specific monoclonal antibodies are already committed to the T-cell lineage because most of them transcribe the genes encoding the delta and epsilon chains of the CD3 complex. About half of such pro-T cells synthesize IL-4 mRNA in the absence of any exogenous stimulation. Upon culture with IL-4, pro-T cells extensively proliferate and differentiate into functionally competent, mature gamma delta T cells expressing a T-cell receptor repertoire similar to that of gamma delta T cells that can be found in postnatal thymus. The IL-4 response of pro-T cells is not mediated by induction of the interleukin 2 (IL-2)-IL-2 receptor pathway and, unlike IL-2-driven T-cell differentiation, does not require the presence of stromal cells. Taken altogether, these findings suggest that an autocrine IL-4-mediated pathway might be implicated in early thymocyte differentiation--namely, in the generation of T cells bearing the gamma delta T-cell receptor.\r"

Unlike isolates of HTLV-I from Japan, the West Indies, the Americas, and Africa, which share greater than or equal to 97% sequence homology, the Melanesian strains of HTLV-I were only 91.8%-92.5% identical with a prototype Japanese HTLV-IATK-1. The nucleotide sequence of proviral DNA from the Solomon Islander with HTLV-I myeloneuropathy also diverged markedly from that of HTLV-I isolated from Japanese patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy and from Jamaican patients with tropical spastic paraparesis, suggesting that these variant viruses are capable of causing disease. The HTLV-I variants from Papua New Guineans, in turn, differed by nearly 4% from the Melanesian variants from Solomon Islanders, indicating the existence of another HTLV-I quasi-species. By contrast, HTLV-I strains from two residents of Bellona Island, a Polynesian Outlier within the Solomon Islands, were closely related to cosmopolitan prototype HTLV-I (greater than or equal to 97% sequence identity), suggesting recent introduction, possibly during this century. These findings are consistent with a proto-Melanesian HTLV-I strain of archaic presence, which evolved independently of contemporary cosmopolitan strains, and pose new questions about the origin and global dissemination of HTLV-I.\r"

The temperature of maximum stability (tmax) as determined by circular dichroism (CD) was 18.1 degrees C, and the midpoints of the thermal unfolding transitions (tm) were 0.6 degrees C and 30.0 degrees C. These values may be compared with the tm of 52.5 degrees C for wild-type staphylococcal nuclease, for which no cold denaturation was observed under these conditions. When the stability of the mutant was examined in 2H2O by NMR, CD, or fluorescence, a substantial increase in the amount of folded protein at the tmax was noted as well as a decrease in tmax, reflecting increased stability.\r"

The double-strand break initiates a recombination event that leads to intron transfer. We found previously that I-TevI cleaves td delta In target DNA 23-26 nucleotides upstream of the intron insertion site. DNase I-footprinting experiments and gel-shift assays indicate that I-TevI makes primary contacts around the intron insertion site. A synthetic DNA duplex spanning the insertion site but lacking the cleavage site was shown to bind I-TevI specifically, and when cloned, to direct cleavage into vector sequences. The behavior of the cloned duplex and that of deletion and insertion mutants support a primary role for sequences surrounding the insertion site in directing I-TevI binding, conferring cleavage ability, and determining cleavage polarity. On the other hand, sequences around the cleavage site were shown to influence cleavage efficiency and cut-site selection. The role of cleavage-site sequences in determining cleavage distance argues against a strict \"ruler\" mechanism for cleavage by I-TevI. The complex nature of the homing site recognized by this unusual type of endonuclease is considered in the context of intron spread.\r"

The predicted protein is homologous to the seven transmembrane G protein-coupled superfamily of receptors. Bradykinin and its analogs stimulate a Cl- current oocytes expressing the receptor with the rank order of potency: bradykinin approximately Lys-bradykinin greater than [Tyr8]-bradykinin much greater than [Phe6]bradykinin. This is the rank order of potency observed for these compounds in competitive binding assays on soluble receptor from rat uterus. Des-Arg9-bradykinin (10 microM) elicits no response when applied to oocytes expressing the receptor; thus, the cDNA encodes a B2 type bradykinin receptor. [Thi5,8,DPhe7]bradykinin, where Thi is beta-(2-thienyl)-alanine, is a very weak partial agonist and inhibits the bradykinin-mediated ion flux, suggesting the cDNA encodes a smooth muscle, rather than a neuronal, B2 receptor subtype. Receptor message has a distribution consistent with previous reports of bradykinin function and/or binding in several tissues and is found in rat uterus, vas deferens, kidney, lung, heart, ileum, testis, and brain. Receptor subtypes are a possibility because several tissues contain two or three message species (4.0, 5.7, and 6.5 kilobases). Southern blot high-stringency analysis demonstrated that the rat, guinea pig, and human genomes contain a single gene. As bradykinin is a key mediator of pain, knowledge of the primary structure of this receptor will allow a molecular understanding of the receptor and aid the design of antagonists for pain relief.\r"

  ".W": "We have cloned the cDNA of the heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase (HRI) of rabbit reticulocytes. In vitro translation of mRNA transcribed from the HRI cDNA yields a 90-kDa polypeptide that exhibits eIF-2 alpha kinase activity and is recognized by a monoclonal antibody directed against authentic HRI. The open reading frame sequence of the HRI cDNA contains all 11 catalytic domains of protein kinases with consensus sequences of protein-serine/threonine kinases in conserved catalytic domains VI and VIII. The HRI cDNA also contains an insert of approximately 140 amino acids between catalytic domains V and VI. The HRI cDNA coding sequence has extensive homology to GCN2 protein kinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to human double-stranded-RNA-dependent eIF-2 alpha kinase. This observation suggests that GCN2 protein kinase may be an eIF-2 alpha kinase in yeast. In addition, HRI has an unusually high degree of homology to three protein kinases (NimA, Wee1, and CDC2) that are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle.\r"

Here we present evidence that Rev is a stable oligomer both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of Rev mutants indicates that oligomerization is essential for RNA binding and hence Rev function. The oligomerization and RNA binding domains overlap over 47 amino acids. Within this region is a short arginine-rich motif found in a large class of RNA binding proteins. Substitution of multiple residues within the arginine-rich motif abolishes oligomerization, whereas several single-amino-acid substitution mutants oligomerize but do not bind RNA. Thus, Rev's arginine-rich motif participates in two distinct functions: oligomerization and RNA binding.\r"

This study sought to determine whether functional isoforms of the receptor exist that may be important in generating this diversity of cellular response. We have isolated a cDNA encoding an isoform of the low-affinity human GMR that is a product of alternative splicing of the GMR gene and results in a predicted 410-amino acid protein with a cytoplasmic domain that is rich in serine residues, a feature of regions critical in signal transduction for other receptors of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily. This receptor bound ligand and was functionally active when introduced into a murine factor-dependent cell line; mRNA transcripts representative of this isoform were coexpressed with those for a previously isolated 400-amino acid isoform of the GMR in normal hematopoietic and leukemic cells. In view of the recent isolation of a cDNA, designated GM-CSF R beta, that confers high-affinity binding of GM-CSF in cotransfection experiments with the low-affinity receptor, we suggest that the previously isolated low-affinity receptor be designated GM-CSF R alpha 1 and the one described in this report be designated GM-CSF R alpha 2.\r"

  ".W": "The repressor/activator protein 1 (RAP1) binds to the upstream activating sites of many genes, the silencer elements flanking the unexpressed mating-type loci HMR and HML, and the poly(C1-3A) sequences at telomeres, suggesting that RAP1 might have three distinct regulatory functions. To determine the in vivo role of RAP1 in repression of the HMR silent locus, we developed a screen to isolate rap1 mutants specifically defective in silencing. Fifteen independent mutants defining four different rap1 alleles were isolated. These alleles are defective to different extents in repression of an HMR locus containing a mutated, but fully functional, silencer. All four alleles are missense mutations in only three codons within a small C-terminal region of the gene. These silencing-defective mutants have no apparent growth defects, indicating that expression of the large number of essential genes that have promoters containing RAP1-binding sites is normal. A transcriptional silencing function of RAP1 can therefore be genetically separated from its presumably essential activation functions. Surprisingly, three of the silencing-defective rap1 alleles have significantly longer telomeres, suggesting that the function of RAP1 in both transcriptional silencing and telomere-length regulation may be related. In addition, we have demonstrated that increased gene dosage of either SIR1 or SIR4, two other factors required for silencing, suppresses the silencing defect of the rap1 mutants. The properties of SIR4 dosage suppression suggest that SIR4 protein may interact directly with RAP1 at silencers.\r"

  ".W": "Stable resistance to the anthelmintic hycanthone can be produced in the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni by exposing immature parasites in mice to the drug. Within a single generation, genomic rearrangements, detected as rRNA-encoding DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), accompany the appearance of resistance in this model. One of these RFLPs, an approximately 3.6-kilobase BamHI fragment, was shown previously to associate consistently with resistance in independent generations of the JHU strain of S. mansoni. To characterize the genetic changes responsible for this RFLP, the fragment was cloned and sequenced. A comparison of the cloned fragment with a normal 18S rRNA gene demonstrated that the drug resistance-associated RFLP fragment arises through the addition of 732 base pairs into an 18S rRNA gene, 134 base pairs downstream of the junction of the intergenic spacer and the mature 18S rRNA gene. The mutation is nonrandom, targets one, or a few only, of the 100 or so copies of the ribosomal genes, and may represent the incomplete duplication of the gene since the inserted element is identical in sequence to the region contiguous to it. The sequence spanning the junction of the insertion and the original 18S rRNA gene was used as a specific primer for the BamHI RFLP in PCR experiments. The analysis conclusively demonstrated that the mutation is induced rather than selected by the drug since the junctional sequence was not detectable in the drug-sensitive parent population of schistosomes. In addition, analysis of four, independently derived, resistant lines indicated that the same region of the gene was mutated each time. Together, these data demonstrate that reproducible changes are induced during the acquisition of resistance in schistosomes and suggest that the resistant phenotype is induced rather than selected from preexisting forms.\r"

  ".U": "91352069\r", 
  ".W": "We have tested the hypothesis that the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene product, called the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), mediates anion transport in normal human sweat duct cells. Sweat duct cells in primary culture were treated with oligodeoxynucleotides that were antisense to the CFTR gene transcript in order to block the expression of the wild-type CFTR. Anion transport in CFTR transcript antisense-treated cells was then assessed with a halide-specific dye, 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium, and fluorescent digital imaging microscopy to monitor halide influx and efflux from single sweat duct cells. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide treatment (3.9 or 1.3 microM) for 24 hr virtually abolished Cl- transport in sweat duct cells compared with untreated cells or control cells treated with sense oligodeoxynucleotides. Br- uptake into sweat duct cells was also blocked after a 24-hr CFTR transcript antisense treatment, but not after treatment for only 4 hr. Lower concentrations of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were less effective at inhibiting Cl- transport. These results indicate that oligodeoxynucleotides that are antisense to CFTR transcript inhibit sweat duct Cl- permeability in both a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. This approach provides evidence that inhibition of the expression of the wild-type CFTR gene in a normal, untransfected epithelial cell results in an inhibition of Cl- permeability.\r"

One percent of the yeast in the original library contained HSA21-derived YACs; between 45% and 54% of the yeast recovered after transformation with ISV vectors contained human YACs. Integrative selection provides a rapid means of obtaining a highly enriched population of human chromosome-specific YACs by eliminating the labor-intensive steps of isolating and screening primary transformants. The procedure is biased toward the selection of YACs that contain a large number of targets for homologous recombinations; thus, libraries constructed by this procedure will be composed primarily of the largest YACs in the population.\r"

AR is also functionally related to this family of growth regulatory molecules and is able to bind and activate the 170-kDa EGF receptor (EGFR). Human EGFR-3 (HER3)/ERBB3 is a recently identified protein related to the EGFR that is widely expressed in breast carcinomas and is a candidate receptor for EGF-like growth factors. Differential expression of these putative ligands and receptors in transformed cells suggests that they may function in an autocrine manner to regulate tumor cell growth. Specific mRNA transcripts for TGF-alpha [4.8 kilobases (kb)], AR (1.4 kb), cripto (2.2 kb), and HER3 (6.2 kb) were expressed in a majority of human colon cancer cell lines. HER3 mRNA was detected in 55% of primary or metastatic human colorectal carcinomas but in only 22% of normal colon mucosa and 32% of normal liver samples. In contrast, cripto and AR mRNA were expressed in 60-70% of primary or metastatic human colorectal cancers but in only 2-7% of normal human colonic mucosa. Immunostaining also detected AR protein in primary and metastatic colorectal tumors but not in normal colon or uninvolved liver. These findings suggest that cripto and AR may be useful markers to discriminate between normal and malignant colonic epithelium and may provide a selective growth advantage for colorectal carcinomas.\r"

Transfection of human kidney cells with NO synthase cDNA elicits NADPH diaphorase staining. The ratio of NO synthase to NADPH diaphorase staining in the transfected cells is the same as in neurons, indicating that NO synthase fully accounts for observed NADPH staining.

  ".U": "91352080\r", 
  ".W": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) variant patients show the clinical characteristics of the disease, with increased frequencies of skin cancer, but their cells have a normal, or nearly normal, rate of nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced DNA damage and are only slightly more sensitive than normal cells to the cytotoxic effect of UV radiation. However, they are significantly more sensitive to its mutagenic effect. To examine the mechanisms responsible for this hypermutability, we transfected an XP variant cell line with a UV-irradiated (at 254 nm) shuttle vector carrying the supF gene as a target for mutations, allowed replication of the plasmid, determined the frequency and spectrum of mutations induced, and compared the results with those obtained previously when irradiated plasmids carrying the same target gene replicated in a normal cell line [Bredberg, A., Kraemer, K. H. & Seidman, M. M. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 8273-8277]. The frequency of mutants increased linearly with dose, but with a slope 5 times steeper than that seen with normal cells. Sequence analysis of the supF gene showed that 52 of 53 independent mutants generated in the XP variant cells contained base substitutions, with 62 of 64 of the substitutions involving a dipyrimidine. Twenty-eight percent of the mutations involved A.T base pairs, with the majority found at position 136, the middle of a run of three A.T base pairs. (In the normal cells, this value was only 11%.) If the rate of excision of lesions from supF in the two cell lines is equal, our data suggest that XP variant cells are less likely than normal cells to incorporate dAMP opposite bases involved in photo-products. If such incorporation also occurs during replication of chromosomal DNA, this could account for the hypermutability of XP variant cells with UV irradiation.\r"

  ".W": "The insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4 was immunolocalized in rat cardiac muscle under conditions of basal and stimulated glucose uptake, achieved by fasting and a combined exercise/insulin stimulus, respectively. In basal myocytes there was very little (less than 1%) GLUT4 in the different domains of the plasma membrane (sarcolemma, intercalated disk, and transverse tubular system). GLUT4 was localized in small tubulo-vesicular elements that occur predominantly near the sarcolemma and the transverse tubular system and in the trans-Golgi region. Upon stimulation approximately 42% of GLUT4 was found in the plasma membrane. Each domain of the plasma membrane contributed equally to this effect. GLUT4-positive, clathrin-coated pits were also present at each cell surface domain. The remainder of the labeling was in tubulo-vesicular elements at the same sites as in basal cells and in the intercalated disk areas. The localization of GLUT4 in cardiac myocytes is essentially the same as in brown adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and white adipocytes. We conclude that increased glucose transport in muscle and fat is accounted for by translocation of GLUT4 from the intracellular tubulo-vesicular elements to the plasma membrane. The labeling of coated pits indicates that in stimulated myocytes, as in adipocytes, GLUT4 recycles constantly between the endosomal compartment and the plasma membrane and that stimulation of the exocytotic rate constant is likely the major mechanism for GLUT4 translocation.\r"

  ".U": "91352082\r", 
  ".W": "Although GPC has long been recognized as a degradation product of phosphatidylcholine, only recently is there wide appreciation of its role as a compatible and counteracting osmolyte that protects cells from osmotic stress. GPC is osmotically regulated in renal cells. Its level varies directly with extracellular osmolality. Cells in the kidney medulla in vivo and in renal epithelial cell cultures (MDCK) accumulate large amounts of GPC when exposed to high concentrations of NaCl and urea. Osmotic regulation of GPC requires choline in the medium, presumably as a precursor for synthesis of GPC. Choline transport into the cells, however, is not osmoregulated. The purpose of the present studies was to use MDCK cell cultures as a defined model to distinguish whether osmotically induced accumulation of GPC results from increased GPC synthesis or decreased GPC disappearance. The rate of incorporation of 14C from [14C]choline into GPC, the steady-state GPC synthesis rate, and the activity of phospholipase A2 (which can catalyze a step in the synthesis of GPC from phosphatidylcholine) are not increased by high NaCl and urea. In fact all are decreased by approximately one-third. Therefore, we find no evidence that high NaCl and urea increases the GPC synthesis rate. On the other hand, the rate coefficient for cellular GPC disappearance and the activity of GPC:choline phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.2), which catalyzes degradation of GPC, are decreased by approximately two-thirds by high NaCl and urea. We conclude that high NaCl and urea increase the level of GPC by inhibiting its enzymatic degradation.\r"

This is the most common region of previously described somatic p53 mutations in tumor specimens and of the germ-line p53 mutations in patients with the Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome. Evaluation of the patient's family revealed several direct maternal and paternal relatives who had died at a young age from different types of cancer. The association of a germ-line p53 mutation with an intracranial malignancy and a strong family history of cancer suggests that p53 gene mutations predispose a person to malignancy and, like retinoblastoma mutations, may be inherited.\r"

  ".W": "Individual rat hippocampal neurons, grown in isolation from other neurons on small spots of permissive substrate, were studied in order to characterize the electrical properties of the synapses that such cells formed with themselves (autapses). Excitatory (probably glutamatergic) or inhibitory (probably type A gamma-aminobutyratergic) autapses were frequently found. Excitatory autaptic currents reversed near the potential expected for monovalent cations were blocked by the glutamatergic antagonist kynurenic acid, and possessed a slow component with the pharmacological profile of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type channels. These currents also exhibited trial-to-trial statistical fluctuations in their amplitudes, this being well-described by quantal analysis. Inhibitory autaptic currents reversed at hyperpolarized potentials, as expected for chloride-permeable pores and were blocked by picrotoxin, a type A gamma-aminobutyric receptor antagonist. It is concluded that autaptic currents in culture are identical to those found at synapses.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies indicated that the erythroidtype (GLUT1) glucose transporter isoform contributes to basal but not insulin-stimulated hexose transport in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In the present studies it was found that basal hexose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was about 50% lower than that in 3T3-L1 or CHO-K1 fibroblasts. Intrinsic catalytic activities of GLUT1 transporters in CHO-K1 and 3T3-L1 cells were compared by normalizing these hexose transport rates to GLUT1 content on the cell surface, as measured by two independent methods. Cell surface GLUT1 levels in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes were about 10- and 25-fold higher, respectively, than in CHO-K1 fibroblasts, as assessed with an anti-GLUT1 exofacial domain antiserum, delta. The large excess of cell surface GLUT1 transporters in 3T3-L1 adipocytes relative to CHO-K1 fibroblasts was confirmed by GLUT1 protein immunoblot analysis and by photoaffinity labelling (with 3-[125I]iodo-4-azidophenethylamido-7-O-succinyldeacetylforskoli n) of glucose transporters in isolated plasma membranes. Thus, GLUT1 intrinsic activity is markedly reduced in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts compared with the CHO-K1 fibroblasts, and further reduction occurs upon differentiation to adipocytes. Intrinsic catalytic activities specifically associated with heterologously expressed human GLUT1 protein in transfected CHO-K1 versus 3T3-L1 cells were determined by subtracting appropriate control cell values for hexose transport and delta-antibody binding from those determined in the transfected cells expressing high levels of human GLUT1. The results confirmed a greater than 90% inhibition of the intrinsic catalytic activity of human GLUT1 transporters on the surface of mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes relative to CHO-K1 fibroblasts. We conclude that a mechanism that markedly suppresses basal hexose transport catalyzed by GLUT1 is a major contributor to the dramatic insulin sensitivity of glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of platelets with thrombin and other agonists causes a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of multiple proteins on tyrosine. To identify candidate protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs; EC 2.7.1.112) that may be responsible for these phosphorylation events, we analyzed the expression of seven Src-family PTKs and examined the association of these kinases with known platelet membrane glycoproteins. Five Src-related PTKs were detected in platelets: pp60SRC, pp60FYN, pp62YES, pp61HCK, and two LYN products of Mr 54,000 and 58,000. The Fgr and Lck PTKs were not detected. Although strict comparative quantification of protein levels was not possible, pp60SRC was detected at higher levels than any of the other kinases. In addition, glycoprotein IV (GPIV, CD36), one of the major platelet membrane glycoproteins, was associated in a complex with the Fyn, Yes, and Lyn proteins in platelet lysates. Similar complexes were also found in two GPIV-expressing cell lines, C32 melanoma cells and HEL cells. Since PTKs appear to be involved in stimulus-response coupling at the plasma membrane, these results suggest that ligand interaction with GPIV may activate signaling pathways that are triggered by tyrosine phosphorylation.\r"

Soluble growth factors activate chemical signaling pathways and stimulate proliferation by binding to transmembrane receptors. Insoluble fibronectin also binds to cell-surface receptors; however, it is thought to act primarily via effects on the cytoskeleton and cell shape. We recently demonstrated that cell spreading on surface-adsorbed fibronectin activates the Na/H antiporter and that inhibition of this chemical-signaling pathway suppresses growth. We now show that insoluble fibronectin activates the Na/H antiporter by clustering and immobilizing integrin alpha 5 beta 1, independent of effects on cell shape. These results show that an extracellular matrix receptor can behave similarly to a growth factor receptor to activate a signaling pathway implicated in growth control.\r"

Genomic clones encoding the VCAM1 gene were isolated and the organization of the gene was determined. The gene, which is present in a single copy in the human genome, contains 9 exons spanning approximately 25 kilobases of DNA. Exons 2-8 contain C2 or H-type immunoglobulin domains. At least two different VCAM-1 precursors can be generated from the human gene as a result of alternative mRNA splicing events, which include or exclude exon 5. A consensus TATAA element is located upstream of the transcriptional start site. The VCAM1 promoter contains consensus binding sites for NF-kappa B, the GATA family of transcription factors, as well as an AP1 site. The VCAM1 gene was assigned to the 1p31-32 region of chromosome 1 based on the analysis of human-mouse hybrid cell lines and in situ hybridization. Structural analysis of the human VCAM1 gene provides the basis for alternative mRNA splicing and an initial approach to elucidating the regulation of VCAM-1 expression.\r"

The abundance of ABF2 and the phenotype of abf2- null mutants argue that this protein plays a key role in the structure, maintenance, and expression of the yeast mitochondrial genome. The predicted amino acid sequence of ABF2 is closely related to the high-mobility group proteins HMG1 and HMG2 from vertebrate cell nuclei and to several other DNA-binding proteins. Additionally, ABF2 and the other HMG-related proteins are related to a globular domain from the heat shock protein hsp70 family. ABF2 interacts with DNA both nonspecifically and in a specific manner within regulatory regions, suggesting a mechanism whereby it may aid in compacting the mitochondrial genome without interfering with expression.\r"

In antisense-injected eggs, maturation-promoting factor was not reactivated after the completion of meiosis I, leading to the formation of nuclei containing decondensed chromatin within 2-3 hr after polar body extrusion. This was correlated with a failure of the injected eggs to accumulate newly synthesized cyclin B. The c-mos protooncogene thus appears to affect the pathway that regulates cyclin B stability during meiosis of mouse eggs.\r"

Physical mapping of the human MAP-1B locus places its chromosomal location at 5q13, in proximity to the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) locus. SMA is a degenerative disorder primarily affecting motor neurons. Genetic linkage analysis of SMA families using a human dinucleotide repeat polymorphism just 3' of the MAP-1B gene has shown tight linkage to SMA mutations. These mapping data together with the postulated role of MAP-1B in neuronal morphogenesis and its localization in anterior horn motor neurons suggest a possible association with SMA.\r"
