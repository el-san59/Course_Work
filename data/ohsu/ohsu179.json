  ".W": "It has been reported that intravenous fat emulsions, because of their isotonicity and neutral pH, support microbial growth, but traditional parenteral nutrition solutions, being hypertonic and more acidic, are not as supportive. To date, few studies have documented microbial growth in total nutrient admixtures (TNA) containing dextrose, amino acids, fat, electrolytes, vitamins, and trace elements. This study was undertaken to analyze the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and four gram-negative enteric bacilli in three different nutrient admixtures, with and without the inclusion of 5% fat emulsion. The composition of the admixtures was either 5, 10, or 25% dextrose; either 0 or 5% fat; and 3% amino acids, electrolytes, vitamins, and trace elements. All admixtures were innoculated with 100 colony-forming units per milliliter, incubated at room (25 degrees C) or refrigerated (4 degrees C) temperature, with samples withdrawn at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours and plated in triplicate. Only C. albicans demonstrated any significant growth regardless of fat content. The pH of the admixtures was similar (acidic), and all solutions were hypertonic and found to inhibit bacterial growth. Conclusions suggest that TNA, when formulated with normal concentrations of additives, is no more likely to support growth of contaminant organisms than the traditional solutions. This contradicts the notion that the addition of fat to total parenteral nutrition will enhance the ability of these admixtures to support microbial growth.\r"

In addition, we recorded the number of nitroglycerin tablets taken and angina attacks reported per treatment course. Each treatment course was one month long, with each patient participating for a total of three months. This allowed all patients to be exposed to each of the three products for one treatment course, thereby serving as their own controls. Thirty-eight patients completed the three-phase crossover and expressed a preference. Results showed that Transderm-Nitro was significantly preferred over both Nitro-Dur and Nitrodisc (p less than 0.005). Most of the preferences were based on cosmetic appearances or adhesive qualities. Additionally, results showed that there was no difference in efficacy among the three products when number of angina attacks reported and number of nitroglycerin tablets taken were compared.\r"

  ".U": "87276624\r", 
  ".W": "During pubertal development in girls, the attainment of regular ovulatory menstrual cycles usually is preceded by cycles that are either anovulatory or show a defective luteal phase. It is not known whether these defective cycles are caused by inadequate luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) secretion or by an inadequate response of the pituitary-ovarian axis to LH-RH stimulation. To shed new light on this matter, the authors analyzed endocrine data from 12 menstrual cycles induced by pulsatile LH-RH therapy in five women with primary amenorrhea of hypothalamic origin. Anovulatory cycles occurred with and without an increase in estrogen excretion and with and without a luteinizing hormone surge. In addition, ovulatory cycles with and without deficient corpus luteum function were observed. Most of these types of anovulatory and ovulatory menstrual cycles also have been described during normal puberty. Therefore, these observations suggest that, during normal pubertal development, maturation of the pituitary gonadotropes and of the ovary occurs, as well as the increased secretion of LH-RH from the hypothalamus, which the overall process depends upon.\r"

No statistically significant difference was found in serum estradiol levels on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration, mean number of follicles (greater than 15 mm), mean total number of oocytes recovered, mean number of mature oocytes recovered, or number of pregnancies per transfer. The total number of oocytes recovered in the one- and two-ovary groups was 47 and 123, respectively. There was a significantly greater mean number of immature oocytes recovered (1.5 +/- .03 versus 0.5 +/- 0.2, P less than 0.01) and embryos transferred (2.7 +/- 0.3 versus 1.7 +/- 0.3, P less than .04) in patients with two ovaries. Though not statistically significant, a trend was noted in the two-ovary group for a greater number of pregnancies per transfer (9:25 versus 2:14). The authors conclude that single-ovary patients may have a reduced outcome with IVF compared with patients with two ovaries.\r"

The Mg2+-ATPase was increased moderately, and no correlation with glycemia was found. To study the in vivo effect of insulin, ATPase activities were measured in uncontrolled diabetics before and after a 24-h continuous insulin perfusion administered by means of an artificial pancreas. ATPase activities were corrected after normalization of glycemia. It therefore seems that glycemia and/or insulinemia are involved in the regulation of erythrocyte Na+-K+ ouabain-sensitive ATPase and to a lesser extent in that of Mg2+-dependent ATPase.\r"

Clinical features and resultant diagnosis were compared with 403 consecutive patients who referred themselves direct to the accident unit during the study period. There was no significant difference in the incidence of serious injuries between the two referral groups. Multivariate analysis of the combined referral groups revealed that age over 60 years, inability to weight-bear and distal fibular tenderness were critical diagnostic parameters and this result has been reported elsewhere. Further analysis of these features in each referral sub-group showed that significantly more patients referred by their family doctor were in the important over 60 years age group but that the incidence of the other diagnostic parameters were similar in the two populations. Using the presence of any one of these criteria as an indication for hospital referral with a view to X-ray examination, 70% of the patients seen first by their own doctor did actually warrant radiography compared with 58% in the self-referred group. However, it is apparent that more efficient hospital referral from family practice is possible by use of the clinical parameters described above and no serious fracture would have been missed by a general practitioner using such a policy in this population. Analysis of the reasons for referral by general practitioners is discussed and a suggested management regime is provided for all patients with inversion ankle injuries who attend their own doctor in the first instance.\r"

In normal kidneys, antiprostacyclin synthase serum caused intense staining in peritubular capillaries, in the adjacent renal interstitial cells and in glomerular mesangial regions. Antiprostaglandin endoperoxide synthase serum caused staining of collecting duct epithelial cells, cells of the thin ascending limb and possibly glomerular mesangial cells. Prostacyclin synthase-positive staining was graded 5+ (scale of 0+ to 5+) in all kidney samples. Medullary collecting tubule prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-positive staining was graded 4+ or 5+ in kidney samples from patients with acute tubular necrosis or acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and from patients with liver failure without the hepatorenal syndrome. However, prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-positive staining was markedly diminished or absent (average 1+) in patients with the hepatorenal syndrome. These data suggest that loss of the medullary prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase is the cause of diminished urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion in the hepatorenal syndrome.\r"

Monolayer cultures of fat-storing cells incorporated both [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine into glycosaminoglycans; the rate of incorporation increased with culture time (3-fold between the third and eighth days in culture). About 80% of newly formed glycosaminoglycans were secreted into the medium. Analysis of the types of glycosaminoglycans revealed a different pattern for cells and medium, respectively, which is subject to culture time. Heparan sulfate remains primarily cell-bound and, therefore, has a low fractional secretion rate. Chondroitin sulfate and even more dermatan sulfate are the main types of glycosaminoglycans in the medium. Dermatan sulfate represents about 60% of total medium glycosaminoglycans. In advanced cultures (eighth day), this type becomes the predominant one in the cell layer. The reduction of the molecular weight of native medium-sulfated molecules by papain digestion and beta-elimination and the puromycin-induced inhibition of their synthesis by more than 75% suggest the formation of glycosaminoglycans as complex proteoglycans. It is concluded that fat-storing cells are a major cellular source of dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate in liver connective tissue. Since the pattern of proteoglycans of fat-storing cells closely resembles that found in the fibrotic liver matrix, this cell type might be of pathogenetic significance for the accumulation of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate in cirrhotic connective tissue.\r"

  ".W": "Our objective was to correlate biochemical or functional properties that could be measured by fluorescence to individual nonparenchymal cell types by the simultaneous detection of forward angle light scatter and fluorescence. Cells were released from liver following selective digestion of hepatocytes by Pronase perfusion. To fractionate the cells according to size, isolates were subjected to unit gravity sedimentation on a 1 to 5% sucrose gradient. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the resulting fractions as well as the original unfractionated cells. This reaffirmed that forward angle light scatter is linearly related to the sedimentation velocity (size) of the cells and that it can be used to assess cell sizes in an unfractionated population. Endocytosis of fluorescently tagged particulates was studied by injecting either fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged colloidal albumin or Coumarin-tagged latex beads (0.57 micron diameter) prior to Pronase perfusion. Beads were found only in the largest cells (Kupffer cells). Since endothelial cells could endocytose only colloidal albumin, they were readily differentiated from nonendocytosing, nonsinusoidal cells (\"lymphocytes\"). Staining cell protein with fluorescein isothiocyanate made possible the determination of relative protein content per cell (\"lymphocyte\": endothelial:Kupffer cell was 0.57:1.0:2.0). To determine relative esterase activities, mixed cell isolates were incubated in fluorescein diacetate (\"lymphocyte\":endothelial:Kupffer cells was 0.13:1.0:2.4). Uptake of rhodamine 123 was used to assess mitochondrial function (\"lymphocyte\":endothelial:Kupffer cells was 0.45:1.0:14.6). Mitochondrial volume per cell is known to be 1:2 for endothelial:Kupffer cells. Therefore, the large difference in rhodamine uptake is not related to volume.\r"

Between October, 1983 and September, 1984, 676 consecutive patients who needed blood or plasma transfusions during or after elective surgery, who had no history of liver disease and had never received blood previously, were studied. The patients were given a total of 4,813 (mean = 7) units. Ninety-six patients developed posttransfusion hepatitis, which yielded a hepatic incidence of 20 cases per 1,000 units of transfused blood. Ninety-two patients had non-A, non-B hepatitis, 3 had hepatitis B and 1 had cytomegalovirus infection. The incubation periods for non-A, non-B hepatitis ranged from 2 to 26 (mean = 9.5 +/- 4) weeks. In 68 (73%) patients, the hepatitis was completely asymptomatic; only 24 (27%) patients developed symptoms, including jaundice and hepatomegaly. There were no cases of fulminant hepatitis. Sixty per cent of the patients still had elevated serum ALT levels 1 year after the onset of hepatitis. The 96 patients with hepatitis had received a mean of 9.6 blood units, as compared to a mean of 6.7 units for the unaffected patients (p less than 0.001). This study demonstrated that non-A, non-B hepatitis remains a common and important complication of blood transfusion despite screening of blood donors for HBsAg and elevated serum ALT levels.\r"

  ".W": "The role of leukotrienes was investigated in frog virus 3-induced hepatitis in rats. Frog virus 3 elicited an enhanced generation of cysteinyl leukotrienes in vivo as monitored by measurement of N-acetyl-leukotriene E4 as the major endogenous metabolite of cysteinyl leukotrienes secreted into rat bile. N-Acetyl-leukotriene E4 concentrations were elevated for more than 4 hr after frog virus 3 injection. In vitro experiments using cultured rat liver Kupffer cells of high purity indicated that these cells can produce and metabolize leukotrienes and are thus a possible source of leukotrienes elicited in vivo by frog virus 3. The selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor AA 861 and the dual inhibitor of arachidonate lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase, BW 755C, reduced the hepatocellular injury after a high dose of frog virus 3 by about 50 and 80%, respectively, as judged from plasma activities of ALT and sorbitol dehydrogenase at 24 hr after frog virus 3 administration. Our in vivo and in vitro studies argue in favor of an important role of leukotrienes as mediators in frog virus 3 hepatitis in rats.\r"

Conscious femoral arterial pressure (direct arterial puncture) and intraocular pressure (Schiotz tonometer) were measured weekly before and after the surgical induction of hypertension in 11 healthy male mongrel dogs and before and after unilateral nephrectomy in 15 normotensive control dogs. Preoperative mean arterial pressure (102 +/- 5 vs 99 +/- 8 [SD] mm Hg, hypertensive vs control dogs) and intraocular pressure (18.1 +/- 2.5 vs 17.7 +/- 2.1 mm Hg, hypertensive vs control dogs) were similar in both groups. In normotensive control dogs, mean arterial pressure and intraocular pressure averaged over the postoperative period (4-8 weeks) did not differ significantly from preoperative values. In contrast, during the same period arterial pressure significantly increased and intraocular pressure significantly decreased in hypertensive dogs (arterial pressure, 163 +/- 8 mm Hg; intraocular pressure, 11.9 +/- 4.0 mm Hg; p less than 0.001 for both values compared with corresponding values in control dogs). Intraocular pressure was inversely related to arterial pressure in hypertensive dogs (r = 0.56, p less than 0.01). These observations indicate that intraocular pressure decreases with the development of canine one-kidney, one wrapped hypertension. The mechanism of this decrease may be related to abnormalities in Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase activity found in this form of hypertension.\r"

Seven days later, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vascular relaxations were examined in vascular rings taken from hypertensive (thoracic aorta, carotid artery) and normotensive (abdominal aorta) regions. Relaxation of phenylephrine-contracted rings in response to endothelium-dependent agonists (acetylcholine, A23187) was impaired, compared with that in sham-operated and intact controls, in regions exposed to the elevated blood pressure (i.e., above the coarctation). Responses to acetylcholine and A23187 in the abdominal aorta, below the coarctation, were not altered. The diminished endothelium-dependent responses in the thoracic aorta were not affected by pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. In contrast to acetylcholine and A23187, responses to the endothelium-independent agonist nitroprusside were not attenuated in vessels from hypertensive regions, indicating that the defect occurred in the endothelium. The EC50 for acetylcholine-induced relaxations of thoracic aorta correlated significantly with mean arterial pressure above the coarctation, indicating that the extent to which endothelium-dependent relaxation is impaired is in proportion to the degree of blood pressure elevation. This study suggests that the diminished relaxations by endothelium-dependent agonists is a local response to the elevation of blood pressure and is not due to a circulating factor.\r"

  ".W": "The mammalian atrial hormone atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) has been shown to have potent natriuretic and diuretic actions as well as vasodilator effects when released into the circulation. To investigate how the levels of the circulating form of this peptide change with alteration of intravascular fluid volume, we measured immunoreactive ANF in the plasma of Wistar rats after acute saline load, acute furosemide treatment, and chronic water restriction. Circulating levels of immunoreactive ANF increased significantly (p less than 0.001) 1 minute after acute saline load and returned to normal levels within 5 minutes. Volume contraction induced by furosemide treatment of chronic water restriction significantly reduced the circulating immunoreactive ANF. These data indicate that acute volume expansion causes an immediate release of immunoreactive ANF into the general circulation and acute volume contraction results in a decline of circulating levels of immunoreactive ANF, which is maintained during chronic volume contraction. These results suggest that the atria detect alterations in intravascular fluid volume and respond by changing the levels of ANF acutely as well as chronically and thereby participate in the regulation of body fluids and, perhaps, of blood pressure.\r"

Administration of atenolol, 50 mg/day, for 4 weeks to 10 untreated subjects resulted in a significant (p less than 0.001) rise in plasma ANP levels (from 38.8 +/- 9.5 to 68.7 +/- 20.6 pg/ml). In 31 patients undergoing long-term treatment with beta-blockers, multivariate regression analysis revealed that age, pretreatment mean blood pressure, and plasma concentration of cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were significant predictors of plasma ANP levels. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in patients with essential hypertension elevates plasma ANP levels with a concomitant rise in cGMP concentrations, and that increased ANP in plasma may play a role in the compensatory mechanism that operates in response to beta-adrenergic receptor blockade.\r"

To test whether acetate per se can stimulate central chemoreceptors, HCl- or Hacetate-acidified mock CSF was infused via the cisterna magna in conscious rabbits with catheters preimplanted under anesthesia. HCl infusion induced a greater decrease in PaCO2 refuting this hypothesis. To evaluate the role of the carotid body HCl and Hacetate were infused intravenously in an intact (CB+) and a chemodenervated group (CB-). In CB+ rabbits Hacetate infusion produced a greater decrease in PaCO2. In CB- rabbits, the fractional decrease in arterial PaCO2 was less for both acids compared with that of the CB+ rabbits, but it was significantly greater for Hacetate infusion (21.2 +/- 2.5%, mean +/- SE) than for HCl infusion (14.5 +/- 1.8%). Thus the carotid body is not necessary for the greater Hacetate ventilatory stimulation. The working hypothesis is that nonionic diffusion of Hacetate into brain or acetate replacement of HCO3- in CSF production lowers [HCO3-] near central chemoreceptors.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of SQ 29,548, a thromboxane receptor antagonist, on airway responses were investigated in paralyzed, anesthetized, mechanically ventilated cats. Intravenous injections of the thromboxane and prostaglandin precursor, arachidonic acid (AA), and the thromboxane mimic, U 46619, produced dose-related increases in transpulmonary pressure and lung resistance and decreases in dynamic compliance. After administration of SQ 29,548 (0.5 mg/kg iv), bronchoconstrictor responses to AA were reduced by approximately 50%, whereas responses to U 46619 were reduced by approximately 90%. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor, sodium meclofenamate (2.5 mg/kg iv), blocked the component of the airway response to AA remaining after treatment with SQ 29,548. The thromboxane receptor antagonist had no significant effect on bronchoconstrictor responses to prostaglandins F2 alpha, and D2, methacholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, histamine, or BAY K 8644, an agent that promotes calcium entry. Reductions in systemic arterial pressure in response to AA were enhanced by the thromboxane receptor antagonist and abolished by meclofenamate. SQ 29,548 had no effect on terminal enzyme activity in microsomal fractions from cat lung. These data support the hypothesis that AA-induced bronchoconstriction in the cat is mediated in large part by the actions of thromboxane A2. These data also suggest that U 46619 and U 44069 stimulate the same airway receptor as thromboxane A2 and mimic the bronchomotor effects of this hormone, which has not yet been isolated as a pure substance. These data demonstrate that SQ 29,548 is a selective thromboxane receptor antagonist in the airways of the closed-chest cat and may be a useful probe for studying responses to thromboxane A2 in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the lung.\r"

We studied the effects of raised osmolarity of the solution bathing the luminal surface of excised canine tracheal epithelium. Osmolarity was increased by adding NaCl or mannitol. NaCl addition induced a concentration-dependent fall in short-circuit current and a rise in transepithelial conductance (-33% and +14% per 100 mosM, respectively). Unidirectional isotopic fluxes of 22Na, 36Cl, and [14C]mannitol were measured in short-circuited tissues in the base-line state and after addition of NaCl or mannitol to an isotonic mucosal solution. NaCl addition (75 mM) caused a 50% increase in conductance (G) and a parallel increase in [14C]mannitol permeability (Pmann), indicating an increase in paracellular permeability. Net Cl- secretion was reduced 50%, and net Na+ absorption was unchanged despite an increased chemical gradient for absorption, indicating an inhibition of active ion transport. Mannitol addition (150 mM) abolished net Na+ absorption but did not increase G or Pmann or change net Cl- secretion. These results suggest that responses to increased tracheal surface liquid osmolarity during spontaneous breathing may occur in both the cellular (inhibition of active Na+ and Cl- transport) and paracellular (increased [14C]mannitol permeability) compartments of the mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that infusion of HCl changes blood pressure and respiration independent of decreases in circulating blood pH, an extracorporeal arteriovenous shunt (20 ml/min) between the femoral artery and vein was installed in anesthetized cats. Into this loop, acid (0.25 M HCl) and, approximately 10 cm downstream, base (0.25 M NaOH) could be infused simultaneously. Likewise, either acid or base could be infused individually. Right ventricular (Prv) and arterial (Pa) blood pressure, tidal volume (VT), and respiratory frequency (fresp) were recorded as well as blood gases and pH in arterial, right ventricular, and shunt loop blood at the reentrance into the animal. When HCl and NaOH were infused simultaneously and at equimolar rates (0.2 mmol/min for 10 min), there was a large increase in Prv, with little change or decrease in Pa. Respiratory frequency was increased, but total ventilation was not elevated because of a concomitant fall in VT. The rise in Prv and increase in fresp were transient in that they could only be evoked during the first HCl-NaOH infusion in a given animal. Repetitive infusions of HCl-NaOH into the same animal failed to elicit the response. Similar transient acid effects were evoked when HCl was infused without NaOH but not when NaOH was infused without HCl. During the second and third infusion of HCl, ventilatory responses were elicited that were explainable by stimulation of known chemoreceptors. The transient rise in Prv and fresp evoked by acid infusion might be explained by release of an agent from blood elements at the tip of the HCl infusion catheter, which in turn would constrict pulmonary vessels and influence breathing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Infection was verified bacteriologically and histologically. Macromolecule secretion and ion and water fluxes were subsequently measured in tracheal tissues in vitro and were compared with values from sham-infected sheep. Macromolecules were radiolabeled with 35SO4 and [3H]threonine, and we measured the secretion of macromolecule-bound radiolabel onto the mucosa. Unidirectional fluxes of Cl-, Na+, and water were measured with radioactive tracers under open-circuit and short-circuit conditions. Lung infection increased basal secretion of bound 35SO4 (by 189%) and bound [3H]-threonine (by 110%). It significantly increased net Na+ absorption under open- and short-circuit conditions and induced open-circuit net absorption of Cl- and water (16 +/- 29 microliters X cm-2 X h-1). These changes were associated with specific recruitment of neutrophils and elevated levels of arachidonate metabolites (thromboxane B2 and leukotriene B4) in the airways. Thus the bacterial pneumonia-induced changes in tracheal mucus secretion may be the result of airway inflammation.\r"

  ".U": "87279698\r", 
  ".W": "A model of the respiratory control system incorporating both chemical and respiratory neuromechanical feedbacks is proposed to describe the steady-state ventilatory responses to CO2 inhalation and exercise. It is postulated that ventilatory output (VE) is set by the respiratory center to minimize a net operating cost representing the conflicting challenges of arterial chemical imbalance and respiratory-mechanical discomfort (intolerance of effort), given, respectively, by a quadratic function of arterial PCO2 and a logarithmic function of VE. In addition, the system is assumed to be mechanically limited at maximum VE (Vmax). The predicted responses in VE during moderate hypercapnia, exercise, and ventilatory loading closely mimic those normally observed, even though no separate signal unique to exercise is assumed. As a quantitative validation, the model yielded good fits to ventilatory response data obtained in eight healthy subjects during eucapnic and hypercapnic exercise; the predicted Vmax averaged approximately 77% of the maximum voluntary ventilation in all subjects. The results demonstrate the plausibility of the proposed optimization mechanism and suggest an important role for respiratory-mechanical factors in the control of VE.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in PCO2 and PO2 during expiration have been ascribed to simultaneous gas exchange, but other factors such as ventilation-perfusion inhomogeneity in combination with sequential emptying may also contribute. An experimental and model approach was used to study the relationship between gas exchange and changes in expired PCO2 and PO2 in anesthetized dogs during prolonged high tidal volume expirations. Changes in PCO2 and PO2 were quantified by taking the area bounded by the sloping exhalation curve and a line drawn horizontally from a point where the Fowler dead space plus 250 ml had been expired. This procedure is similar to using the slope of the exhalation curve but it circumvents problems caused by nonlinearity of the PCO2 and PO2 curves. The gas exchange components of the CO2 and O2 areas were calculated using a single-alveolus lung model whose input parameters were measured in connection with each prolonged expiration. The relationship between changes in experimental CO2 areas caused by sudden reductions in mixed venous PCO2 (produced by right atrial infusions of NaOH) and those calculated by the model was also studied. In seven dogs, calculated CO2 and O2 areas were 13% higher and 25% lower than the respective experimental areas, but interindividual variations were large. Changes in experimental CO2 areas caused by step changes in mixed venous PCO2 were almost identical to changes in the calculated areas. We conclude that the changes in PCO2 and PO2 during expiration cannot be explained solely by gas exchange. However, the single-alveolus lung model accurately predicts changes in the CO2 exhalation curve caused by alterations in the alveolar CO2 flow.\r"

Twelve had severe myelopathy and seven were wheelchair-bound before OPLL was diagnosed, while six patients had had operations elsewhere for their neurological dysfunction. There was a close association between OPLL and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (Forestier's disease) on plain radiographs, seven patients having both disorders. Enhanced CT scans proved to be the best diagnostic method for the localisation of cord compression, and magnetic resonance imaging, used on four recent cases, provided the best visualisation of the extent of involvement in the sagittal plane. We aim to heighten awareness of OPLL in non-orientals, in whom the clinical features, histological characteristics, and radiographic patterns are very similar to those of oriental patients.\r"

This solution has proved to be cost-effective and functional.\r"

Subunit mRNAs were determined by blot hybridization using rat FSH beta genomic DNA, and alpha and LH beta complementary DNA (cDNA). Rat FSH beta mRNA is 1.7 kilobase in size. After ovariectomy, female FSH beta mRNA levels increased fourfold, whereas those of LH beta and alpha increased twenty- and eightfold, respectively. With estradiol, all subunits returned toward normal levels. Male LH beta and alpha mRNA levels rose eight- and fourfold, respectively, 40 d postcastration, but FSH beta mRNA levels increased minimally. After 7 d of testosterone propionate, LH beta and alpha mRNAs declined to normal levels, whereas FSH beta mRNA increased slightly. We conclude that in female rats FSH beta is negatively regulated by gonadal steroids, but to a lesser extent than LH beta or alpha mRNAs, and there is a differential regulation of FSH beta mRNA levels in males as compared with females at the time points examined.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that the bicarbonate reabsorptive capacity of the proximal tubule is increased in metabolic acidosis. For net bicarbonate reabsorption to be regulated, there may be changes in the rate of apical H+ secretion as well as in the basolateral base exit step. The present studies examined the rate of Na+/H+ exchange (acridine orange method) and Na+/HCO3 cotransport (22Na uptake) in apical and basolateral membranes prepared from the rabbit renal cortex by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. NH4Cl loading was used to produce acidosis (arterial pH, 7.27 +/- 0.03), and Cl-deficient diet with furosemide was used to produce alkalosis (arterial pH, 7.51 +/- 0.02). Maximal transport rate (Vmax) of Na+/H+ antiporter and Na+/HCO3 cotransporter were inversely related with plasma bicarbonate concentration from 6 to 39 mM. Furthermore, the maximal transport rates of both systems varied in parallel; when Vmax for the Na+/HCO3 cotransporter was plotted against Vmax for the Na+/H+ antiporter for each of the 24 groups of rabbits, the regression coefficient (r) was 0.648 (P less than 0.001). There was no effect of acidosis or alkalosis on affinity for Na+ of either transporter. We conclude that both apical and basolateral H+/HCO3 transporters adapt during acid-base disturbances, and that the maximal transport rates of both systems vary in parallel during such acid-base perturbations.\r"

Using the fluorescent indicator Quin 2, it is demonstrated that PGE2 inhibits the increase in cytosolic-free calcium concentration [Ca2+]i. Reconstitution of calcium mobilization in the presence of PGE2 by the calcium ionophore A23187 results in a partial restoration of both interleukin 2 (IL2) production and cell proliferation and has no effect on the inhibition of transferrin receptor expression. In contrast, the treatment of cell cultures with the tumor promotor 12.0 tetra decanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) abrogates the suppressor activity of PGE2. When T lymphocyte stimulation is provided by the combination of A23187 and TPA, the PGE2 inhibitory effect does not occur. These data also indicate that the down regulation of transferrin receptor by PGE2 is proximal to protein kinase C activation and is not associated with decreased expression of the functional IL2 receptor.\r"

In the presence of almost identical early distal bicarbonate loads (481 +/- 40 pmol/min in controls and 444 +/- 50 pmol/min in K depletion), distal bicarbonate reabsorption was significantly enhanced in K depletion (247 +/- 17 pmol/min) as compared with controls (179 +/- 18 pmol/min). These values are significantly different from each other, and both are severalfold higher than bicarbonate reabsorption in nonloaded conditions. In conclusion, distal bicarbonate reabsorption is load dependent, and distal bicarbonate reabsorption is stimulated in K depletion.\r"

C1q inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation and adherence of platelets to glass, effects attributable to the collagen-like region of C1q. We examined the actions of C1q on HF activation. Incubation of C1q with HF before addition of HF-deficient plasma extended the activated partial thromboplastin time. Similarly, when glass tubes were coated with C1q before testing, the partial thromboplastin time of normal plasma was increased. C1q reduced the activation of HF by ellagic acid, as measured by the release of p-nitroaniline from the synthetic substrate H-D-prolyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride, an effect inhibited by monoclonal anti-human C1q murine IgG and by digestion of C1q by collagenase. Thus, C1q inhibits activation of HF in vitro in clot-promoting and amidolytic assays and suggests a regulatory mechanism for the inhibition of coagulation.\r"

In high-TBG subjects, the reduction of T4 and T3 plasma clearance rates (by 51% and 54%, respectively) was associated with normal daily productions; T4 and T3 distribution volumes were significantly reduced. In FDH subjects T4 clearance was less reduced (by 31%) than in high TBG; consequently T4 production rate was significantly increased (by 42%); T4 and T3 distribution volumes and T3 clearance rate were unchanged. Increased T3 peripheral production in FDH (by 24%) indicates that T4 bound to abnormal albumin is more available to tissues than T4 carried by TBG, thus suggesting an important role of albumin in T4 availability to the periphery.\r"

Because immunologic resistance is associated with this spectrum, the study of leprosy provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into immunoregulatory mechanisms in man. In addition, serodiagnosis to identify early cases and prevention by vaccination are areas of active research. For patient care, a network of Regional Hansen's Disease Centers has been established under the sponsorship of the National Program for Hansen's Disease, Carville, LA. Because the patients are often poor, their receipt of care and medication without cost helps to ameliorate at least one of the burdens imposed by this potentially devastating illness.

Predictions of an individual's use of long-term care services were made during the initial evaluation and were based on whether the person could complete all the manual tasks and on the amount of time required to do so. Outcomes were determined by telephone interviews by a trained social worker in Dec 1984. A statistically significant association (P less than 0.005) was observed between the predictions and actual outcomes. Analysis of variance confirmed that the mean times for each outcome were different (F = 2.6, P less than 0.05). The results suggest that timing manual performance offers a useful way to prospectively identify older persons at risk of requiring additional long-term care services.\r"

Recombinant IL 2 (r-IL 2) effectively promoted proliferation of SA-stimulated blood and spleen B cells, but supported less vigorous responses of lymph node B cells. By contrast, r-IL 2 enhanced DNA synthesis of all anti-mu-stimulated B cells early in culture, but did not promote sustained proliferation of anti-mu-stimulated lymph node B cells and only promoted ongoing DNA synthesis of some anti-mu-activated blood (eight out of 17) and spleen (five out of 14) B cell preparations. Recombinant interferon-gamma (r-IFN-gamma) and a commercial preparation of B cell growth factor (BCGF) also augmented DNA synthesis of all three B cell populations stimulated with SA or anti-mu early in culture, but neither alone was able to sustain maximal proliferation. Markedly enhanced sustained proliferation of all three anti-mu- and SA-stimulated B cell populations was noted when cultures were supported by the combination of r-IL 2 and BCGF, or to a lesser extent by r-IL 2 and r-IFN-gamma. The generation of ISC from SA-stimulated blood or spleen but not lymph node B cells was effectively supported by r-IL 2 alone. Differentiation of lymph node B cells required the combination of r-IL 2 and BCGF. These studies emphasize the importance of both the activation stimulus and the origin of the B cells in determining the lymphokine requirements of human B cell responsiveness.\r"

Soluble anti-TcR and anti-Lyt-2 mAb but not soluble anti-LFA-1 mAb inhibited exocytosis, which was triggered by solid-phase anti-TcR mAb. Immobilized anti-Lyt-2 did not inhibit secretion triggered by immobilized anti-TcR mAb; immobilized anti-LFA-1 mAb had an modest inhibiting effect. Inhibition of exocytosis by soluble anti-Lyt-2 mAb was greater when stimulating anti-TcR mAb were immobilized at a lower density on a plastic surface. When the requirement for TcR cross-linking was bypassed by synergistic action of phorbol ester and ionophore A23187, no inhibition of exocytosis by soluble anti-Lyt-2 mAb was detected.

  ".W": "By using sensitive two- and three-color immunofluorescence analyses, we readily detect CD5B cells (Leu 1 B cells) in the peripheral blood of normal adults. These circulating CD5 B lymphocytes coexpress B cell differentiation antigens CD20, CD21, CD19, sIgM and sIgD, and HLA-DR. Unlike CD5-negative B cells from most adults, however, these cells co-express CD11, a finding also noted for malignant CD5 B cells from several patients with CLL. Between normal volunteers, there exists heterogeneity in the proportion of PBL that co-express CD5 and B cell surface antigens, such cells representing between 0 and 6% of peripheral lymphocytes. Despite such heterogeneity between unrelated individuals, analyses of repeated blood samples from the same person reveal that the proportions of CD5 B lymphocytes are constant over time. Examination of blood samples from related family members, monozygotic twins, and triplets indicate that the relative proportion of circulating CD5 B cells may be genetically regulated. This is apparent even for monozygotic twins discordant for rheumatoid arthritis. Four sets of such twins are examined, each set having one individual with clinically active, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and another without detectable rheumatoid factor or clinical pathology. Despite such noted differences, twins from each set share identical proportions of circulating CD5 B cells. In summary, our studies indicate that the level of CD5 B lymphocytes is a rather stable phenotypic trait that is under genetic control.\r"

  ".W": "By using sensitive three-color fluorescence flow cytometric techniques, we were able to identify a T4+T8+ thymocyte with high T3 surface density (T3H) representing 4 to 9% of thymocytes. To characterize the T3HT4+T8+ cell, thymic subpopulations with high T3 surface density (T3H) and lower T3 density (T3L/T3-) were compared with regard to T6 expression. The T3H subpopulation was characterized by lower numbers of T6+ cells and reduced levels of T6 antigen density, whereas the T3L/T3- population was greater than 90% T6+ and expressed this antigen at high cell surface density. In addition, T3H fractions appeared to possess higher levels of nuclear activation with respect to the T3L/T3- population as indicated by increased log 90 degrees scatter profiles. These results suggest that thymocytes with high T3 surface expression are not only more differentiated, but also more activated than the majority of the thymic population. The T3HT4+T8+ fraction could be distinguished from T4+T8+ thymocytes with lower T3 density not only by an increased log 90 degrees scatter profile, but also by the presence of T4+T8+ cells with reduced levels of T8 surface antigen. Our results indicate that T4+T8+ thymocytes with high T3 surface density are a distinct subpopulation and may represent the immediate precursors of the phenotypically more mature T3HT4+T8- and T3HT8+T4- subpopulations found in human thymus.\r"

The proliferative response of PHA-blasts to IL-2 was significantly lower in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) than in normal subjects. To clarify the reason for this defect, the expression of IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) on PHA-blasts was investigated using anti-Tac antibody and purified IL-2. Cytofluorometric analysis showed no statistical differences in the Tac positivity of PHA-blasts among normal subjects and patients with active and inactive SLE. Scatchard analysis using 125I-labeled anti-Tac monoclonal antibody revealed that the number of Tac epitopes on PHA-blasts was also not different among them. Next, the affinity of IL-2R expressed on PHA-blasts was determined by Scatchard analysis using radiolabeled IL-2 as a ligand. The number of high affinity IL-2R on the PHA-blasts was significantly decreased in patients with active and inactive SLE, as compared with normal subjects. The responsiveness of PHA-blasts to exogenous IL-2 was well correlated to the number of high affinity IL-2R, but not to the number of Tac epitopes or total IL-2R. Inasmuch as high affinity components of IL-2R are functionally active, the defective expression of high affinity IL-2R may be responsible for the T cell dysfunctions in SLE.\r"

  ".W": "Two-hundred twenty-four hybridomas secreting monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor (hIgMRF) derived from MRL-lpr/lpr, MRL-+/+ and C57BL/6-lpr/lpr autoimmune mice were analyzed with regard to IgG subclass and domain specificity, and some for VH gene expression patterns. Among these mice, only MRL-lpr/lpr develop arthritis. Clonotypes specific for each of the four mouse IgG subclasses and clonotypes reacting with more than one IgG subclass were identified. Although each panel contained several clonotypes, the predominant one differed in each strain (MRL-lpr/lpr, anti-IgG2a; MRL-+/+, combined anti-IgG2a and 2b; C57BL/6-lpr/lpr, anti-IgG1 or combined anti-IgG1, 2a, and 3). The IgG domains recognized by these monoclonals were defined with mutant Ig carrying IgG1 heavy chains that lacked either the CH1 or CH3 domains, variant Ig carrying hybrid IgG2b-2a heavy chains, and IgG fragments. Inhibition of hIgMRF binding to IgG substrates by protein A was also assessed. Most determinants were assigned to the CH3 domain, but determinants in the hinge region, CH2 domain, and in some instances, even in the Fab portion, could also be identified. Hybridization of cytoplasmic RNA from 35 classes of diverse IgG subclass specificity with VH gene probes representing seven of the approximately 10 VH families (7183, S107, Q52, J558, J606, 36-60, X24) indicated that approximately 90% of these clones expressed VH genes belonging to the large J558 gene family. The results indicate that murine IgMRF are extremely heterogeneous in IgG subclass and domain specificities; the genetic background influences RF specificity characteristics that may relate to pathogenicity; and considering the complexity of the J558 VH gene family and reported RF heavy chain assignments to additional VH gene families, it appears that VH genes encoding RF are diverse.\r"

  ".W": "A primary interest in immunity to intracellular pathogenic microorganisms and tumors is to understand the mechanisms by which macrophages are activated for various functions. Two parameters of macrophage activation are the expression of the class II histocompatibility proteins or Ia molecules (1), and cytotoxic activity. The ability of T cells to induce these responses has been extensively documented and occurs via their secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) after interaction with antigen (2-6). However, in a recent study using mice with the severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mutation (7) which have no detectable T or B cell functions (7-9), we were surprised to find the induction of Ia expression on macrophages and the partial inhibition of bacterial growth after infection with Listeria monocytogenes (10). We have now utilized neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific for murine IFN-gamma to investigate the mechanism of macrophage activation in scid mice. We show here that IFN-gamma can be produced by scid mice in the absence of lymphocyte-mediated immunity, and this IFN-gamma is important for macrophage activation during infection with Listeria. These results indicate the presence of an important T lymphocyte-independent mechanism of macrophage activation and IFN-gamma production in response to infection.\r"

A suppressive effect of TNF, LT, and IFN-gamma on the development of granulocyte, macrophage, and mixed granulocyte/macrophage colonies was shown. Suppression of colonies formed after stimulation with G-CSF was greater than that observed after stimulation with GM-CSF. In the presence of a monoclonal antibody to TNF, or polyclonal antibodies to either LT or IFN-gamma, the inhibitory effect of the molecule to which the antibody was directed was abrogated. These findings suggest that progenitor cells responsive to G-CSF or GM-CSF have different sensitivities to the effects of TNF, LT, and IFN-gamma. Defining the interactions of growth factors and inhibitors should increase understanding of mechanisms underlying diseases associated with suppression of normal hemopoiesis, and in predicting the effects in vivo of these bioregulatory molecules in clinical medicine.\r"

  ".W": "Human interleukin 4 (IL-4), also known as B cell stimulatory factor 1, is a T cell-derived glycoprotein consisting of 129 amino acids for which a cDNA has been recently isolated. IL-4 displays little or no B cell growth factor (BCGF) activity in the standard anti-IgM costimulatory assay using suboptimal concentrations of soluble anti-IgM antibody whereas the low m.w. BCGF is very active. When insolubilized anti-IgM was used as the costimulating agent, both IL-4 and the low m.w. BCGF were found to promote B cell proliferation. Human IL-4 is able to induce the proliferation of B lymphocytes preactivated for either 1 day with insolubilized anti-IgM antibody or for 3 days with Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I. However, IL-4 is poorly mitogenic for B cells preactivated for 1 day with the Staphylococcus strain whereas the low m.w. BCGF strongly enhances the proliferation of these B cells. These two findings demonstrate that the preactivation signal necessary to induce human B cells to proliferate in response to IL-4 is critical. The increased tritiated thymidine ([3H]dThd) uptake in preactivated B cell cultures with IL-4 reflects cel proliferation because cell cycle analysis demonstrates that IL-4 induces activated B cells to enter the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle and the addition of IL-4 to preactivated B cell cultures permits the recovery of three- to fourfold more B cells after 4 days of culture. IL-4 and the low m.w. BCGF act in concert to induce the proliferation of anti-IgM-preactivated B cells as demonstrated by [3H]dThd uptake and cell cycle analysis. In striking contrast to the demonstrated antagonistic effect of interferon-gamma on the IL-4-induced expression of the low affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RL/CD23), on B cells, it was found that interferon-gamma enhanced the IL-4-induced proliferation of anti-IgM-preactivated B cells. Finally, it was found that IL-4 had to be present continuously during the culture period to exert an optimal growth-promoting effect on B cell blasts. As a conclusion, IL-4 is able to induce the proliferation of an appropriately activated subpopulation of human B cells.\r"

We found that B cell stimulatory factor-1 (BSF-1) stimulated optimal proliferation of these T cells only after their recent activation by antigen or mitogen. Analysis of cell surface BSF-1 receptor expression indicated that although T cell activation is accompanied by a small increase in BSF-1 receptor expression, the cells also express BSF-1 receptors prior to activation at a time when they do not proliferate in response to BSF-1. BSF-1 was as effective a stimulus as interleukin 2 for inducing proliferation of the Lyt-2+ subpopulation of concanavalin A-activated murine spleen cells and an alloreactive cytolytic T cell clone. However, the L3T4+ subpopulation of concanavalin A-activated spleen and an alloreactive helper T cell clone were less responsive to BSF-1 than to interleukin 2. Taken together, the data indicate an important role for BSF-1 in the regulation of normal T cell proliferation.\r"

Human lymphocytes treated with 10(-4) M histamine for less than 1 hr released a suppressive substance into culture supernatants that was physically, functionally and antigenically similar to human SIRS. Cimetidine and ranitidine, structurally distinct histamine type II (H-2) receptor antagonists, prevented histamine-induced SIRS production. In further experiments, suppression of human polyclonal IgM PFC responses by Con A and interferons, substances that activate the SIRS pathway, was inhibited by H-2 receptor antagonists. Activation of lymphocytes to produce SIRS by Con A or interferons was blocked by cimetidine or ranitidine. These data demonstrate that production of SIRS is induced by histamine, and raise the possibility that H-2 receptor binding may play a role in the SIRS pathway.\r"

  ".U": "87281641\r", 
  ".W": "Hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid particles (HBcAg) can function as a T cell-independent antigen when injected into athymic mice. However, immunization of euthymic mice with HBcAg results in dramatically increased anti-HBc titers. Therefore we have examined the murine T cell response to HBcAg in terms of immunogenicity, the influence of H-2-linked genes, and the fine specificity of T cell recognition using synthetic peptide analogs. The HBcAg was shown to be an extremely efficient immunogen in terms of T cell activation as measured by the in vivo dose required to induce T cell sensitization (1.0 microgram), and the minimal in vitro concentration required to elicit interleukin 2 (IL 2) production (0.03 ng/ml). The degree of T cell immunogenicity of HBcAg and its ability to directly activate B cells most likely explain the enhanced humoral response to HBcAg in euthymic mice and HBV-infected patients. The influence of H-2-linked genes on the humoral response to HBcAg was discernable, and high responder (H-2k,s,d), intermediate responder (H-2b,f), and low responder (H-2p) haplotypes were identified. The H-2-linked regulation of the T cell response correlated with in vivo anti-HBc production. Examination of the fine specificity of T cell recognition revealed HBcAg-specific T cells from a variety of strains recognize multiple but distinct sites within the HBcAg/HBeAg sequence. T cell recognition sites were defined by small (16 to 21 residue) synthetic peptides. Each strain recognized a predominant T cell determinant, and the fine specificity of this recognition process was dependent on the H-2 haplotype of the responding strain. For example H-2s,b strains recognized p120-140, H-2f,q strains recognized p100-120, and H-2d mice recognized p85-100 predominantly. Because these sequences are common to both HBcAg and a nonparticulate form of the antigen termed HBeAg, these results indicate that HBcAg and HBeAg are highly cross-reactive at the T cell level although they are serologically distinct. These findings may have clinical relevance, because T cell sensitization to HBeAg and the subsequent seroconversion to anti-HBe status correlates with viral clearance during hepatitis B infection.\r"

Most of the Mr 40,000 inhibitor can be recovered from the cell lysate, whereas the Mr 55,000 glycosylated PAI is preferentially secreted. The murine macrophage PAI are functionally similar and immunologically related to PAI synthesized and secreted by human monocytes-macrophages, and to a PAI from human placenta (PAI-2). PAI production by murine mononuclear phagocytes can be modulated both in vivo and in vitro. Bone marrow-derived macrophages do not produce detectable PAI, whereas inflammatory macrophages obtained from thioglycollate-induced peritoneal exudates produce only low levels of PAI. In cultures of resident peritoneal macrophages, phorbol myristate acetate and cholera toxin increase the synthesis of the Mr 55,000 secreted PAI, whereas dexamethasone decreases the synthesis of both PAI; the production of PAI is also enhanced in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1). The overall proteolytic activity of mononuclear phagocytes thus depends in part on the controlled synthesis and secretion of PAI. The balance between the production of plasminogen activators and of their inhibitors could be critical in determining the level of plasminogen-dependent extracellular proteolysis associated with different phases of the inflammatory response.\r"

Almost complete inactivation of organisms from both human biovars was observed after 48 hr of incubation. However, organisms from the lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) biovar survived in mononuclear phagocytes infected after 8 days or more in culture, whereas those from the trachoma biovar continued to be killed by such cells. Phagocytes cultured as long as 21 days killed the trachoma organisms with the same effectiveness as those cultured for 7 days or less. An ultrastructural study of inoculated phagocytes illustrated phagolysosomal fusion with degradation of organisms from either biovar in phagocytes which had been cultured for 24 hr before infection. Phagolysosomal fusion was not observed in cells which had been cultured for 8 days or more and then infected with LGV. The addition of interferon-gamma to these macrophages partially restored the phagocytes' microbicidal activity for LGV. Furthermore, a synergistic effect was observed when eosinophil peroxidase was added with interferon. Specific antibody failed to neutralize the infectivity of LGV organisms in 8-day or older mononuclear phagocytes. The findings may reflect the differences in disease syndromes between the two biovars, with the trachoma biovar causing more peripheral diseases and the LGV biovar causing a more systemic disease, with lymph node involvement as its main syndrome.\r"

To investigate the mechanisms by which healing is established, anti-leishmania cellular and humoral responses in anti-L3T4-treated BALB/c mice were compared to those in control BALB/c and genetically resistant C57BL/6 mice. Lymph node and spleen cells were harvested from L. major-infected animals at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 wk post-infection and examined in vitro for concanavalin A- or L. major antigen (either promastigote or amastigote)-induced IFN-gamma production. Serum was harvested for Western blot analysis against L. major promastigote antigens. Lymph node cells from resistant C57BL/6 mice generated Leishmania antigen-induced IFN-gamma that was maximal by 3 wk; spleen cell IFN-gamma production peaked a week later. Lymph node and spleen cells from susceptible BALB/c mice generated minimal levels of IFN-gamma activity in response to Leishmania antigen stimulation throughout the experiment. Lymph node and spleen cells from BALB/c mice which had been pretreated with GK1.5 generated IFN-gamma in response to Leishmania antigens in vitro at levels that approached those generated by C57BL/6 mice. When splenic mRNA from infected animals was hybridized with a labeled murine IFN-gamma cDNA probe, there were corresponding differences in the amount of IFN-gamma message present, demonstrating that the differences observed in IFN-gamma production in vitro were also apparent in vivo, and were due to differences in transcription. In contrast to C57BL/6 mice which generated only a limited array of Leishmania-specific antibodies, BALB/c mice produced antibodies which reacted with a large number of Leishmania antigens. The GK1.5-treated BALB/c mice developed Leishmania-specific antibodies at a slower rate than did untreated BALB/c mice. However, by 8 wk after infection, the humoral responses of the anti-L3T4-treated BALB/c mice and the untreated BALB/c mice were comparable. These data document the kinetics of ascending immunity from the draining local lymph nodes to the spleen and confirm, both in vitro and in vivo, the correlation of IFN-gamma production with control of infection in leishmaniasis. Further, an L3T4+ T cell subpopulation may be incriminated in the failure of genetically susceptible BALB/c mice to activate curative cell-mediated immunity in response to Leishmania antigens.\r"

The beta-gene expressed by one clone, 8.9, was isolated and the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments were sequenced. The sequence of the V beta 8.9 segment is identical to the V beta 14 sequence, and is joined to D beta 1.1 and J beta 1.1 segments. Northern analysis revealed that three of the eight clones analyzed, 8.5, 8.7, and 8.9, expressed a 1.3 kb transcript that hybridized with the V beta 8.9 probe, indicating that these clones were using the same V beta gene (these clones shared common DNA rearrangements). The remaining five clones did not express V beta 8.9. Southern analysis of DNA obtained from a DPw2-specific tertiary mixed lymphocyte reaction bulk culture from which the clones were derived showed a prominent rearrangement of the V beta 8.9 gene that was indistinguishable from those observed for clones 8.5, 8.7, and 8.9. This prominent rearrangement of V beta 8.9 was not observed in DNA obtained from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. These results suggest that although the number of V beta genes which can contribute to a DPw2 specificity may be relatively large, only a limited number of clonotypes ultimately predominate in the response to certain class II HLA antigens.\r"

Regardless of specific tumor type or switched immunophenotype, isotype switching was accompanied by the rearrangement of the expressed CH gene downstream of VDJH, with concomitant deletion of upstream CH genes in all cases. On the allelically excluded chromosome, 25% of the IgG or IgA tumors have retained C mu, and 75% have deleted C mu. The 5' recombination breakpoints for both productive and excluded alleles lie within or near S mu, 3' of the enhancer. No correlation between the extent of allelically excluded CH deletions and the isotype produced by the tumor was observed. Excluded chromosome deletion endpoints were found 5', equal to, or 3' of productive chromosome deletion endpoints. Furthermore, we have identified at least one IgM+ tumor that has undergone abortive CH gene deletions and have observed several unanticipated switch region deletions and potential translocations. The data suggest that isotype switching in human B cells occurs by a nonsubclass- and nonclass-specific switch recombinase.\r"

  ".W": "The HLA-DR subregion of the human major histocompatibility complex encodes molecules involved in the regulation of the immune response. These HLA class II molecules are transmembrane heterodimers composed of an alpha and a beta chain. The polymorphic beta chains are encoded by multiple, highly homologous loci, whereas the alpha chain is encoded by a single, nonpolymorphic locus. HLA-DR is expressed constitutively on B lymphocytes and on activated T lymphocytes. It can also be induced by interferon-gamma on most nonlymphoid cells. In a quantitative study of the expression of the individual DR beta chain loci, we have investigated: the levels of mRNA transcripts of the two functional DR beta loci (beta I and beta III) in B cells of various haplotypes; whether both beta chain loci are expressed in activated T cells and, if so, the level of expression of each; whether both loci are expressed in interferon-gamma-induced nonlymphoid cells. This analysis relied on locus-specific DR beta chain oligonucleotide probes. Expression of both the beta I and the beta III loci was observed in all cell types and in all haplotypes tested. In every case the amount of beta I mRNA was about 5 times higher than that of beta III mRNA. This indicates a controlled and coordinated regulation of the mRNA levels of these two HLA-DR loci under all conditions of major histocompatibility complex class II gene expression.\r"

In a population of purified monocytes, the appearance of IL 2 receptors occurs on the majority of cells in association with increased levels of HLA-DR. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces maximum numbers of IL 2 receptors within 12 hr, whereas IFN-gamma requires 48 hr. We used cDNA encoding for the human IL 2 receptor to evaluate IL 2 receptor gene expression in resting and activated monocytes. Within 4 hr after LPS stimulation, IL 2 receptor mRNA species of 3500 and 1500 bases appear, reaching peak levels between 8 and 12 hr and declining thereafter. The LPS-activated monocyte IL 2 receptor protein is expressed on the cell surface within a few hours after the detection of IL 2 receptor mRNA. The addition of IL 2 to IL 2 receptor-positive monocytes augments their generation of reactive oxygen intermediates and their cytotoxic activity. Thus monocytes when activated undergo a series of morphologic, phenotypic, and functional changes, including the expression of IL 2 receptors, which may provide an important immunoregulatory pathway.\r"

Exposure of cloned HTL to IL 2 also renders these cells less responsive to concanavalin A (Con A). Here we demonstrate that antigen-unresponsive HTL also accumulate reduced levels of lymphokine mRNA, thus indicating a pretranslational block of the response to antigen. However, HTL which had been pretreated with IL 2 and were unresponsive to antigen responded strongly to antigen + A23187 or to A23187 + PMA but failed to respond to antigen + PMA. With HTL made unresponsive to antigen or to Con A by exposure to IL 2, increases in intracellular calcium ion levels stimulated by Con A also were reduced. Thus, for mouse HTL clones, the IL 2-induced state of unresponsiveness to antigen or Con A appears to reflect an inability of such HTL to increase intracellular free calcium to a level sufficient for activation of lymphokine genes.\r"

To assess the potential utility of this observation in analyzing biochemical mechanisms involved in macrophage activation, we examined the triggering effects of maleylated bovine serum albumin (maleylated-BSA), a defined molecule that clears via similar mechanisms. Cytolysis of P815 mastocytoma targets was triggered by maleylated-BSA, in a dose-dependent manner, in murine peritoneal macrophages primed in vivo by BCG. Unlike bacterial LPS, which triggered cytolysis when used to pretreat the macrophages, maleylated-BSA was only effective if present throughout the period of macrophage-target cytolytic interaction. Maleylated-BSA alone did not lyse the P815 targets and did not affect the binding of such targets by macrophages. Maleylated-BSA was equally effective in triggering cytolysis in BCG-primed macrophages from C3H/HeJ or C3H/HeN mice. Macrophages primed in vitro with IFN-gamma, however, could not be triggered by maleylated-BSA, even though these macrophages bound maleylated-BSA comparably to the BCG-primed macrophages. When responsive macrophages were fully activated in vitro by IFN-gamma and LPS and then allowed to decay to the primed state, maleylated-BSA was then as effective as LPS in triggering cytolysis. Taken together, the results indicate that maleylated-BSA can trigger cytolysis in certain populations of primed macrophages but not in others.\r"

  ".W": "A new dimension of immunotherapeutic selectivity might be achieved if antibodies could distinguish cells that co-express two different surface antigens. Bi-specific monoclonal antibodies (BSMAB) with two different antigen combining sites that share a common Fc region theoretically might have such a potential. Two such BSMAB were produced by hybrid-hybridoma clones prepared by fusion of pre-existing hybridomas and were purified by isoelectric focusing. CD3,4 (IgG2a, IgG2b) recognizes the T cell surface antigens CD3 and CD4, and CD3,8 (IgG2a, IgG2a) recognizes CD3 and CD8. These BSMAB promote complement-mediated lysis of target cells that bear both surface antigens 25 to 3125 times more efficiently than those that express only one of the antigens. This selectivity results from the increased avidity of these antibodies for cells with both antigens, as reflected by the increased surface immunoglobulin concentration detected by flow cytometry. It was also demonstrated that there exists a threshold surface immunoglobulin density necessary for antibody-dependent complement-mediated cytotoxicity microtiter assays for the various IgG antibodies tested in both bivalent and monovalent binding. These results support the associative model of IgG-mediated complement fixation.\r"

Elevated binding of the lectins PNA and SBA to activated B cells was found to be mediated by IL 2-containing supernatants from stimulated EL4 cells as well as by recombinant IL 2. These lectins have specificity for terminal beta-(1-3)-N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues; thus, the quantity or accessibility of these moieties is mediated by IL 2 in activated B lymphocytes. PNA binding in all strains tested, regardless of MHC or background genes, was found to be elevated fivefold to 15-fold by exogenous IL 2. To observe this effect, IL 2 must be added during the first 24 hr of culture. Based on anti-Thy-1 + complement depletion studies, T cells were not required, suggesting a direct effect of IL 2 on B cells. The glycoprotein responsible for this elevated binding of PNA has an Mr of approximately 220K and by immunodepletion was shown to belong to the T200 (Ly-5) family of cell surface antigens. These data demonstrate that exogenous IL 2 can mediate alterations in T200 expression on activated B cells that may be related to IL 2-driven modulation of B cell proliferation and/or differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Most in vitro T cell proliferation experiments are performed by using serum-supplemented medium, yet the actual contributions of serum components to cell cycle progression remain ill-defined, thus complicating attempts to fully define requirements for cell division. By utilizing a functional separation between T cell receptor-triggered \"competence\" and IL 2-promoted \"progression\" to independently assess serum requirements during each cell cycle stage, it was shown that serum serves an essential, active role only during the early events of the competence phase (G0-G1 transition) of T cell activation. Serum is required for optimal IL 2 production and the cell surface expression of IL 2 receptors after the stimulation of the T3/Ti antigen receptor complex. In contrast, serum does not function actively during IL 2-mediated progression through the G1 phase of the cycle. Serum proteins serve only a passive role at this stage, preventing the adsorption of IL 2. This same effect can be provided by any number of proteins including IL 2 itself, or even a high cell concentration. Supplementation of serum-free T cell cultures solely with IL 2 and transferrin is sufficient for maximal T cell proliferation, although the time of the peak response is delayed owing to a suboptimal rate of IL 2 receptor expression. Accordingly, the realization that serum is only necessary for the earliest stage of T cell activation will now enable studies designed to identify the critical individual serum components and to define their mechanism of action.\r"

Because a similar clinical picture is present in a heterozygotic sister it is doubted whether all signs and symptoms can be attributed to the beta-glucuronidase deficiency. The probability of a concomitant disorder is discussed. Diagnosis was made both by demonstration of the deficiency in plasma and leucocytes, and by means of hair root analysis. The phenotypic variation and the fact that increased levels of glycosaminoglycans were not found in the urine of the two patients lead to the suggestion that in certain cases a correct diagnosis may be missed if the beta-glucuronidase activity in plasma and leucocytes is not determined and only routine urine investigation is performed as a screening for a mucopolysaccharidosis. Hair root analysis may be a useful method to measure the beta-glucuronidase activity.\r"

Mab 1215 recognizes an epitope on the heavy neurofilament polypeptide (NF-H). In Alzheimer's disease, mab 1215 recognizes only a subpopulation of neurofibrillary tangles and stains a proportion of tangles in the hippocampus but none of those in the olfactory bulb. However, mabs RT97 and BF10 stain the majority of tangles in both brain areas. Of the three antibodies, only mab BF10 recognizes, specifically, axons of granular cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Mab 1215 recognizes more dendrites in the pyramidal layer than either mab BF10 or mab RT97. Our observations indicate that neurofilaments are not identical in all axons and that, contrary to previous reports, NF-H is present in dendrites. The dendritic form of NF-H appears to be different from NF-H in axons and this could be due to differences in the state of phosphorylation of NF-H. We suggest that the finding that distinct subpopulations of tangles exist indicates that tangles are not static lesions. Further investigations into this possibility may illuminate the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.\r"

The CSF of 4 MS patients was FLC negative. In both cases of neurosyphilis FLC bands were observed. FLC were never found in normal CSF. Among the indexes of intrathecal immunological activity (IgG oligoclonal bands, FLC, IgG index, intra-blood-brain barrier IgG synthesis rate, pleocytosis) the FLC proved to be the second most frequent abnormality in MS CSF, the presence of IgG oligoclonal bands being the first. In one MS case an FLC band was found, while all the other indexes of intrathecal IgG production were negative. A high correlation was found between an elevated number of FLC and pleocytosis. The presence of FLC in MS CSF seems to indicate a recent immunological stimulation leading to increased synthesis of FLC within the CNS.\r"

  ".W": "Validation of a computer model is described. The behavior of this model is compared both with mechanical ventilation of a test lung in a laboratory setup that uses a washout method and with manual ventilation. A comparison is also made with results obtained from a volunteer breathing spontaneously through a Bain circuit and with results published in the literature. This computer model is a multisegment representation of the Bain circuit and connecting tubing. For each segment, gas pressure, gas volume flow, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide are calculated for any number of breaths wanted. As a result, the time course of these variables can be generated for any location or, conversely, the carbon dioxide distribution in the system can be calculated for any time instant. A test lung, the human lungs, the ventilator bellows, and the reservoir bag are each represented by a single segment. The shapes of pressure and flow curves and of the capnograms taken at different locations in the Bain tubing are in good agreement. The washout study permits measurement of the time delay between the first expiration and the arrival of carbon dioxide at a particular location. The carbon dioxide level in the test lung decreases during inspiration and is stable during expiration. Quantitative agreement between model and experimental transport delays and carbon dioxide levels is such that the differences can be explained by the inaccuracy of the measurement. This is concluded from a sensitivity analysis. The study of the effect of segment size shows an almost optimal agreement between model behavior and experimental results for a 36-segment model. Execution of a thorough validation is imperative before such models can be used for clinical management and decision making or for teaching.\r"

This article describes a computer algorithm for analyzing and classifying capnograms as normal or as belonging to one of the categories above. The algorithm also generates a diagnostic message when the capnogram deviates from a learned norm for at least three consecutive waveforms (and thus reduces the influence of artifacts). Clinical experience shows reliable waveform recognition by the algorithm.\r"

  ".W": "Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is a well-documented cause of cervical spine stenosis and myelopathy among Japanese patients. Reports of OPLL in North Americans are rare. Choices of diagnostic method and treatment for this entity remain controversial. The authors report the results of management of 20 patients in the United States with symptomatic OPLL of the cervical spine. These represented 10% to 20% of patients operated on over the last 3 years for myelopathy secondary to structural spinal compression. Most of these OPLL patients were Caucasian (60%), male (male:female 4:1), and middle-aged (median age 47.5 years). Six had previously undergone laminectomy or discectomy. Cervical roentgenograms and standard myelography occasionally suggested the diagnosis. Axial computerized tomography (CT) metrizamide myelography with small interslice intervals proved invaluable for diagnosis and operative planning. Magnetic resonance imaging was not necessary for diagnosis. Retrovertebral calcification extended over one to five bodies (mean 2.75). The mass ranged in size from 5 to 16 mm in anteroposterior diameter and reduced the residual canal diameter to a mean (+/- standard deviation) caliber of 9.42 +/- 2.41 mm (mean narrowing ratio 0.44 +/- 0.12). Anterior cervical decompression by medial corpectomy and discectomy with fusion uniformly reduced preoperative myelopathy. Complications were limited to transient neurological deterioration in two patients, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy in one, and halo device pin site infections in two. At a mean postoperative interval of 15 months, improvement was seen in each category of deficit: extremity weakness, hypesthesia, hypertonia, and urinary dysfunction. All fusions produced solid unions. It is concluded that OPLL of the cervical spine is an unexpectedly prevalent cause of myelopathy among patients treated in the United States. Thin-section axial CT metrizamide myelography with small interslice intervals is essential for the investigation of patients who may have OPLL. Anterior decompression and stabilization by medial corpectomy, discectomy, removal of the calcified mass, and fusion is a safe and effective method of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic fibrinolytic therapy for acute stroke is no longer recommended because of resulting systemic fibrinolysis and the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Human tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA) is a native enzyme that converts plasminogen to plasmin with subsequent clot lysis. The affinity for plasminogen is increased several-fold when the substrate is bound to fibrin. At appropriate dosage, \"clot-specific\" thrombolysis may be achieved at the surface of the thrombus without creating systemic fibrinolysis. The authors designed a study to evaluate the effect of intravenous TPA administered 2 hours after acute thromboembolic stroke in rats. This time course was chosen to simulate an analogous clinical situation. Middle cerebral artery embolic stroke was caused by intracarotid injection of 0.025 cc of human blood clot in 16 rats. Regional cerebral blood flow, measured by the hydrogen clearance technique, and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were obtained every 30 minutes for 5 hours after thromboembolism. Eight rats received a 1-hour infusion of intravenous TPA (1.5 mg/kg) 2 hours after injection of emboli. Ipsilateral blood flow increased significantly within 30 minutes after intravenous TPA and reached preembolic levels within 60 minutes. Blood flow did not improve in the eight control rats throughout the experiment. Power spectral analysis of the EEG recordings showed improvement in the treated group compared to the control group. Postmortem angiography revealed proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion in control animals and patent middle cerebral arteries in TPA-treated animals. Serum fibrinogen and fibrin split products were unchanged in both groups, indicating the absence of systemic fibrinolysis. There were no intracerebral hemorrhages. It is concluded that, in this rat model, TPA increases blood flow with subsequent improvement in the EEG recording after thromboembolic stroke without evidence of systemic fibrinolysis. Intravenous TPA may be useful in the treatment of acute stroke in man.\r"

The experimental group received a 1-mg/kg intravenous infusion of TPA via a femoral catheter for 90 minutes. A control group received an equivalent volume of saline. Follow-up angiograms were performed every 15 minutes. The TPA-treated animals showed progressive improvement in flow through previously occluded vessels. Time-density curves of the contrast material over the middle cerebral artery trunk and brain parenchyma were generated. The best integrated curves for the two groups were compared at 30 minutes after occlusion and 90 minutes after treatment. Animals were then observed for 24 hours and their neurological status was documented. Premortem infusion of either Evans blue dye or neutral red dye was performed and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and tissue perfusion were assessed by video planometry. Significant improvements were noted by DSA, and Evans blue and neutral red dye studies in animals treated with TPA.\r"

Rats fed a diet containing PCB rapidly became hypercholesterolemic and maintained high cholesterol levels throughout the 240 d of the experiment. Rats fed a high dietary level of vitamin E plus PCB had higher serum cholesterol and lower liver cholesterol than rats fed a lower level of vitamin E plus PCB. In rats fed PCB, urinary excretion of ascorbic acid was higher than in rats not fed PCB. Urinary ascorbic acid was lower in rats fed high levels of vitamin E plus PCB than in those fed the normal levels of vitamin E plus PCB. Rats fed PCB had lower liver vitamin A storage and higher vitamin A in kidney than rats not fed PCB. This implies that a redistribution of vitamin A occurred in rats fed PCB. Histological observations revealed that central halves of the hepatic lobules of rats fed PCB showed distinct changes consisting of hypertrophy of hepatocytes in the perivenous region and accumulation of vacuoles (lipid droplets) in the cells in the remaining affected portion. Administration of a high dose of vitamin E could not ameliorate this lesion while the treatment depressed effectively the lipid peroxidation. This suggests that the lipid peroxidation was not responsible for the hepatic damage induced by PCB.\r"

The early overfeeding accelerated growth and the overfed rats remained significantly heavier than normally reared siblings as adults. Early overfeeding with this procedure led to an adult obesity at 14 mo characterized by significantly larger epididymal and retroperitoneal fat depots resulting from an increase of both fat cell size and number, and by an increase in adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity. Gastrostomy rearing per se, without overfeeding, resulted in adult rats that weighed the same as normally reared siblings but had significantly larger retroperitoneal fat depots because of more adipocytes. These findings suggest that the quantity of food consumed during early growth and development, and the quality of early nutrition and/or the early rearing environment affect adipose tissue development and have long-term consequences that persist in the rat.\r"

In the present study, the dose-response relationship between dietary protein level (dose) and emergence of AFB1-induced GGT+ foci (response) in livers of rats was determined. Male Fischer-344 rats fed a 20% casein diet were orally administered AFB1 at a dose level of 250 micrograms/(kg X d) (10 doses over 12 d). One week after the last dose, the animals were divided into eight groups and fed isoenergetic diets containing either 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20 or 30% dietary casein for the remaining 12 wk of the study. The development of GGT+ foci, as measured by number and percent of liver volume occupied, displayed a response with three discrete phases. The lowest dietary protein levels, 4, 6, 8 and 10% casein, were associated with a minimal level of GGT+ foci development. Between 10 and 12% dietary casein, the development of GGT+ foci sharply increased, up to the 15-30% dietary casein level. The sudden increase in the formation of GGT+ foci at 10-12% dietary casein was just above the level of dietary casein (6-8%) required for maximum body weight gain. These results in this animal model suggest that protein intake in excess of that required to sustain maximum growth rate may enhance AFB1-induced cancer development.\r"

In the present study, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was used to further characterize the putative guanine nucleotide binding protein that transduces the V1 receptor effects on phosphatidylinositol turnover and Ca++ efflux in these cells. Pretreatment of the cells with low concentrations of NEM did not affect the basal levels of the inositol phosphates and Ca++ efflux but significantly inhibited the AVP-induced increases. NEM pretreatment did not significantly affect [3H]AVP binding to intact cells. Guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate reduced the apparent binding affinity of AVP to cell membranes. NEM pretreatment abolished this guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate effect. AVP stimulated a specific GTPase activity in cell membranes; this effect was also abolished by NEM pretreatment. The results suggest that in A10 cells a guanine nucleotide binding protein sensitive to NEM couples vasopressin receptors to phospholipase C.\r"

The aims of the present study were to document the effect of HO and/or HC on the kinetics of lidocaine, a first choice drug for the i.v. treatment of premature ventricular contractions, and on indocyanine green (ICG), another flow-dependent drug. For this purpose, five groups of rabbits were used: a control group received 2.5 mg/kg i.v. of ICG followed, 30 min later, by 7.5 mg/kg of lidocaine as a bolus. Four other groups received lidocaine as an infusion (261 micrograms/min/kg) for 255 min and ICG (249 micrograms/min/kg) for 8 min, the latter beginning 180 min after the start of the lidocaine infusion. The controls and one test group receiving the lidocaine infusion were breathing air (PaO2 = 89 +/- 2 (S.E.M.) and PaCO2 = 20 +/- 1 mm Hg); the second test group had HO (PaO2 = 51 +/- 1 mm Hg), a third group HC (PaO2 = 68 +/- 1 mm Hg) and the fourth HO combined with HC (HOHC) (PaO2 = 53 +/- 1 and PaCO2 = 61 +/- 2 mm Hg). Multiple blood samples were drawn. Lidocaine and its metabolites and ICG were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Lidocaine volume of distribution was not affected by HO and/or HC. Compared to control values, the clearance of infused lidocaine (CIL) tended to decrease from 65 +/- 2 to 53 +/- 3 ml/min/kg. In animals with HO, HC and HOHC, CIL was 49 +/- 6, 45 +/- 5 and 46 +/- 3 ml/min/kg, respectively, these values not being significantly different from CIL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An inhibitor effect of binding to plasma proteins on the brain extraction was also investigated. Equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C showed that both drugs were highly bound to human serum proteins, including albumin, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and lipoproteins. The free dialyzable drug fraction was inversely related to the protein concentration. The brain extraction of the drugs in the presence of either albumin or alpha-1 acid glycoprotein was inversely related to the protein concentrations in the presence of either albumin or alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, but it was higher than expected from the in vitro measurement of the dialyzable fraction. Despite a significant degree of binding to lipoproteins, no significant reduction in the brain extraction of the drugs was observed, regardless of the class or the concentration of lipoproteins. These data indicate that the amount of circulating darodipine or isradipine available for entry in a peripheral tissue such as brain exceeds the dialyzable fraction of drug. However, the in vivo exchangeable drug fraction still parallels the dialyzable fraction, except if the drug is lipoprotein bound.\r"

The neurons were grown in primary dissociated cell culture, and intracellular microelectrode recording techniques were used. DZ and Ro 15-1788 reversibly enhanced GABA responses from spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximal enhancement was obtained for DZ at 500 nM (82%) and for Ro 15-1788 at 1 microM (18%). CGS 9896 and ZK 91296, in concentrations from 1 nM to 10 microM, were devoid of intrinsic effects in spinal cord and cerebral hemisphere neurons. CGS 8216 and methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) reversibly and dose-dependently reduced GABA responses on spinal cord neurons. Maximal reduction was obtained for CGS 8216 at 50 nM (10%) and for DMCM at 1 microM (39%).

In addition, CGS 9896 antagonized the effects of Ro 15-1788 and CGS 8216 on GABA responses, and CGS 9896 and ZK 91296 antagonized the reduction of GABA responses by DMCM. On the studied neurons, DZ can be classified as an agonist, Ro 15-1788 as a weak partial agonist, CGS 8216 as a weak partial inverse agonist and DMCM as an inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor.

In the tissues preloaded either with [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE), [3H]dopamine ([3H]DA), [3H]-5-hydroxytryptamine or [3H]choline, tritium effluxes were estimated in serial fractions of superfusates. L-threo-DOPS produced a concentration-dependent increase in the spontaneous efflux of [3H]NE both in the cortical and hypothalamic slices and to a lesser extent that of [3H]DA in the striatal slices. These effects were still fully detected when slices were superfused with a calcium-free medium or tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M). Carbidopa at 5 X 10(-4) M but not at 10(-4) M significantly depressed the [3H]catecholamine effluxes induced by L-threo-DOPS. L-threo-DOPS produced a minimum increase in the spontaneous efflux of [3H]-5-hydroxytryptamine but not that of [3H]ACh. L-threo-DOPS (5 X 10(-4) M) significantly reduced the [3H]ACh efflux from electrically stimulated striatal slices and this effect was antagonized by an alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (10(-6) M) or by a D2 DA receptor antagonist sulpiride (10(-6) M). In vivo, L-threo-DOPS (150 mg/kg i.p.) produced a gradual but long-lasting increase in the efflux of [3H]NE from the parietal cortex of the guinea pig pretreated with carbidopa (20 mg/kg i.p.). In the brain homogenates, L-threo-DOPS (10(-10) to 10(-4) M) itself did not inhibit the bindings of [3H]rauwolscine or [3H]spiperone, specific ligands for labeling alpha-2 and D2 receptors, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In blood-free perfused and ventilated rabbit lungs, the influence of calcium channel-blockers on pulmonary prostanoid generation and thromboxane-mediated vasoconstriction was investigated. The specific pathways of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism were stimulated by repetitive pulmonary artery injection of the calcium-ionophore A 23187, which induces the liberation of endogenous AA, or by repetitive application of exogenous AA. In control lungs, both stimuli provoked reproducible phasic vascular pressor responses, accompanied by the release of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin I2 into the perfusion fluid. Repeated stimulus application in the presence of increasing concentrations of different calcium antagonists showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor responses by all agents. The rank order of potency was nimodipin greater than LU-40883 (verapamil derivative) greater than diltiazem and D-888 (verapamil derivative) greater than verapamil for the ionophore-induced pressure increase, whereas diltiazem was nearly ineffective in the presence of exogenously applied AA. The prostanoid release after application of A 23187 was influenced differentially by the calcium channel-blockers. It was not affected by nimodipin and verapamil, it was slightly depressed by the verapamil derivatives D-888 and LU-40883 and it was dose-dependently and in higher concentrations nearly inhibited completely by diltiazem. We conclude that the thromboxane-mediated pulmonary vasoconstriction is inhibited by different-type calcium channel-blockers with a marked rank order of potency. The prostanoid generation induced by stimulation of the lung vascular AA metabolism is influenced differentially by these agents.\r"

  ".U": "87283380\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to evaluate the effect of an exogenous free radical generating system consisting of purine plus xanthine oxidase on the isolated rat heart and in particular to assess the possible contribution of arachidonic acid or its metabolites to toxicity produced by this drug combination. Purine plus xanthine oxidase produced a time-dependent depression in cardiac contractility which was associated with stimulated release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Electron microscopic analysis revealed a distinct separation of the glycocalyx from the sarcolemmal membrane with no apparent intracellular defects. Purine plus xanthine oxidase was a potent stimulus for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6K-PGF1 alpha) synthesis but leukotriene production was undetectable under any condition. Eicosatetraynoic acid, which totally prevents the metabolism of arachidonic acid, accelerated the loss in force and increased LDH release invoked by purine plus xanthine oxidase, but produced no noticeable change in sarcolemmal ultrastructure. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors produced little influence although pretreatment with either acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen decreased contractility toward the end of purine plus xanthine oxidase perfusion. Nordihydroguarietic acid, a purported inhibitor of 5'-lipoxygenase accelerated the loss in force produced by purine plus xanthine oxidase. The nordihydroguarietic acid effects were associated with reduced 6K-PGF1 alpha efflux but LDH release was unaffected. We also examined whether modification of arachidonic acid release through changes in calcium concentration was associated with altered response to purine plus xanthine oxidase. Lowering the calcium concentration to 0.41 mM (from 1.25 mM control) reduced markedly 6K-PGF1 alpha, efflux as well as LDH release. Although the latter is suggestive of protection, hypocalcemic perfusion resulted in a greater loss in force due to free radical generation. Furthermore, cells from these hearts exhibited a greater degree of glycocalyx separation. Increasing the calcium concentration to 2.50 mM produced no further toxic manifestations in the response to purine plus xanthine oxidase, although the release of 6K-PGF1 alpha was increased. Our results suggest complex toxicity induced by an exogenously generated free radical system. The injury produced by this method is restricted to sarcolemmal changes, the latter being dependent on the external calcium concentration. The study further suggests that accumulation of intracellular unesterified arachidonic acid, which may result from peroxidation of membrane lipids, increases tissue injury caused by exogenous free radicals.\r"

In our study, we have analyzed 11 hybridoma lupus anticoagulant antibodies and studied their reactivity with hexagonal and lamellar phospholipids, DNA, IgG, cytoskeletal components, and intact platelets. Our results demonstrate that hexagonal phase phospholipids but not lamellar phospholipids were able to neutralize the lupus anticoagulant activity of all 11 hybridoma antibodies. However, the lupus anticoagulant antibodies differed from one another in their reactivity with DNA, the Fc fragment of IgG, cytoskeletal proteins and platelets. Some of the lupus anticoagulant antibodies reacted with all of these structures, while others reacted with only some or none of the antigens tested. Isoelectric focusing gel analysis confirmed that this polyreactivity was due to a single antibody. Direct binding of lupus anticoagulant antibodies to intact platelets was shown to correlate with the DNA binding activity of the antibodies. Lupus anticoagulant antibodies were also capable of inducing a morphological shape change in platelets. Our data suggest that hybridoma lupus anticoagulant antibodies may react as lupus anticoagulant antibodies only, anti-DNA antibodies, rheumatoid factors, anticytoskeletal antibodies, and antiplatelet antibodies. The degree of overlap in these subgroups and the epitopes responsible for these multiple reactivities remain to be determined.\r"

Sex factors also play a major role in the pathogenesis based on the physiologic effects of estrogen in promoting immunologic hyperactivity. Our findings suggest that a posttranscriptional mechanism is responsible for the functional interleukin 2 (IL-2) defect since transcription of the IL-2 message occurs after mitogenic stimulation. The proliferating cell in the MRL/lpr mouse model of lupus may be an immature T cell. The T cell receptor in these mice has a lower molecular weight than normal. This aberrant T cell receptor might be explained by a defect in glycosylation. The administration of estrogen to pregnant mice late in gestation results in offspring with a permanently altered immune system. These mice develop features of autoimmunity similar to those that occur spontaneously in genetically susceptible autoimmune mice. This phenomenon may have etiopathological significance for familial SLE.\r"

Technologies designed to describe cellular and humoral immunologic events in progress and ways to artificially induce such abnormalities are described. However, until recently techniques capable of defining the genes determining immunologic function or revealing abnormalities of these genes which might predispose to diseases such as lupus were unknown. Since the disease itself can apparently be caused in genetically dissimilar individuals by different pathogenic mechanisms, and since most of the individual autoimmune traits appear to be multigenic, the lupus prone genetic backgrounds will be complex.

These cells may contribute to ongoing immunologically mediated inflammation by functioning as antigen presenting cells (APC). To test this hypothesis, fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with IFN-gamma to induce the expression of HLA-DR antigens. Both fibroblasts and endothelial cells became comparably HLA-DR positive in response to IFN-gamma. Despite this, endothelial cells but not fibroblasts became effective APC for resting T cells. HLA-DR positive fibroblasts could present antigen effectively to resting T cells; however, the HLA-DR negative endothelial cells were also present. These results indicate that expression of Ia is necessary but not sufficient for a cell to present antigen. The data also suggest that at inflammatory sites a number of cells may function in concert to promote antigen recognition by T lymphocytes.\r"

On all days post-trauma there was found a marked reduction of IL-2 production compared to controls with a highly significant nadir from day 5 to day 10 with an almost 80% inhibition of IL-2 (p less than 0.005). C + INDO cells showed increases of IL-2 synthesis over untreated cells ranging from 48% (Day 1) to 220% (Day 7). Removal of adherent cells (C-AC) did not reverse the suppression of IL-2 production. gamma-interferon levels were depressed in parallel with IL-2 levels but did not increase with C + INDO. The phenotyping of the PBMC's showed highly significant suppression of OKT3+, OKT4+, and IL-2R+ lymphocytes as well as a highly significant elevation of the monocyte (p less than 0.005) count. There was a highly significant increase of PGE2 synthesis from monocytes, due to the monocytosis and to a higher capacity of synthesis of the individual cells following trauma. PGE2 levels peaked on Day 5 and 7 post-trauma at 400% of control (p less than 0.005). These data suggest that the suppression of IL-2 synthesis post trauma is caused mainly by two factors: the excessive PGE2 output of inhibitory monocytes and inadequate function in immature and/or blocked lymphocytes. The partial restoration of IL-2 synthesis by indomethacin suggests that blockade of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway as an immunomodulating therapy may reverse some of the immunologic abnormalities in multiple trauma patients.\r"

  ".W": "The management of an acutely ischemic extremity requires knowledge of the response of skeletal muscle (the largest component of the lower limb) to prolonged periods of complete normothermic ischemia. We have used the canine gracilis muscle model to evaluate the extent and distribution of ischemic necrosis after 3 and 5 hours of ischemia and 48 hours of reperfusion. Each muscle was cut into six slices, and the extent and distribution of postischemic necrosis identified by means of nitroblue tetrazolium staining and 99mTc pyrophosphate uptake. After 3, 4, and 5 hours of ischemia the extent of necrosis was 2.0% +/- 0.9%, 30.3% +/- 6.0%, and 90.1% +/- 3.5% (mean +/- SEM), respectively. A statistically significant correlation exists between the extent of necrosis and the uptake of 99mTc pyrophosphate uptake per gram of tissue (y = 1574.9x - 8.4, r = 0.84, p less than 0.001). Most necrosis was centrally located and found in the thickest portion of the muscle. We conclude that there is a graded response in the extent of skeletal muscle necrosis related to the length of ischemic stress rather than an \"all-or-none\" phenomenon. This central distribution of necrosis makes the usual external evaluation of ischemic damage clinically unreliable. In addition, since there was no enveloping fascia in this model, a compartment release alone may not prevent the development of skeletal muscle necrosis. This knowledge of the response of skeletal muscle to ischemia may lead to an improved clinical approach to an extremity suffering a prolonged ischemic insult.\r"

The next step consisted of assessment of the radiation dose received by individuals, based on biological dosimetry, and treatment of those exposed. Medical care involved treatment of skin burns; measures to support bone marrow failure, gastrointestinal tract injury, and other organ damage (ie, infection prophylaxis and transfusions) for those with lower radiation dose exposure; and bone marrow transplantation for those exposed to a high dose of radiation. At Chernobyl, two victims died immediately and 29 died of radiation or thermal injuries in the next three months. The remaining victims of the accident are currently well. A nuclear accident anywhere is a nuclear accident everywhere. Prevention and cooperation in response to these accidents are essential goals.\r"

  ".W": "Although nutritional support is vital to treatment of severe sepsis, the septic patient does not respond normally to glucose infusion. We have used the hyperglycemic glucose clamp technique to investigate the initial hormonal and metabolic responses of the septic patient to glucose under controlled conditions. The plasma glucose concentration was raised to and maintained at 12 mmol/liter for 2 hr in 12 septic patients and 11 normal controls. Glucose utilization, assessed from the amount infused, was significantly depressed in the patients, despite similar plasma insulin concentrations in the two groups. Forearm glucose uptake was similarly impaired. Despite very similar plasma free fatty acid concentrations in the two groups, which were suppressed equally by the glucose infusion, whole-body fat oxidation was elevated in the patients compared with the controls, and suppressed to a lesser extent in response to glucose. Glycerol and ketone body concentrations were elevated in the patients in keeping with a picture of accelerated release, clearance, and oxidation of fatty acids. Plasma cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine concentrations were elevated in the septic patients in a severity-related manner, but not to high levels compared with experimental work. Norepinephrine showed no response to the glucose infusion in either group. Plasma glucagon concentrations were not significantly elevated in the septic patients. We conclude that the hyperglycemic glucose clamp provides a useful model for studying glucose intolerance in sepsis. Impaired glucose utilization in septic patients is associated with increased fat oxidation, although the hormonal basis for these changes is still unclear.\r"

Aminoglycoside treatment, by provoking inappropriate renal magnesium wasting, may contribute to the frequency of hypomagnesemia. We examined the magnesium (Mg) status of six severely burned adolescents during the early phase of recovery. Although provision of Mg met recommended levels, hypomagnesemia occurred in every patient. Two of five of our patients were hypomagnesemic during gentamycin treatment, and five of five during subsequent tobramycin therapy (including the three not affected by gentamycin). Additional episodes occurred in five patients in the absence of aminoglycosides. An interrelationship between Mg status and efficacy of potassium repletion is detailed for one patient. Hypomagnesemia during tobramycin treatment was associated with refractoriness to potassium repletion. Recurrence of hypokalemia during a subsequent diuresis-induced hypomagnesemia was prevented by Mg supplementation. The Mg requirement is increased during recovery from severe burns and appears to exceed that provided by commercially available enteral formulations.\r"

Either an excess or a deficiency of amino acids could theoretically impair normal brain development in the neonate. The purpose of this study was to compare the toxicity and efficacy of two intravenous amino acid solutions, Neopham, modeled after the amino acid pattern found in human breast milk, and Aminosyn, a marketed product, designed for general usage. Sixteen infants and children requiring continuous intravenous nutrition for at least 7 days received the Neopham amino acid solution, and eight infants and children received the Aminosyn amino acid solution as part of a total parenteral nutrition regimen which included glucose, the fat emulsion Intralipid, as well as routine mineral and vitamin additives. There were no significant differences in mean gestational age, body weight, postnatal age, or mean daily nutrient intake between the patients receiving Aminosyn or Neopham. The daily nitrogen intake, excretion, and retention were similar in both groups. In addition, there were no statistically significant differences in either hematological or biochemical parameters between the two study groups. The plasma levels of three essential amino acids, isoleucine, methionine, and valine, rose significantly higher in the Aminosyn-treated patients. The plasma levels of all the essential amino acids increased in both study groups.\r"

  ".W": "We report here our clinical experiences of \"fine bore\" nasogastric feeding tubes. Data have been collated over a 7-year period (1978-1985). A total of 403 patients were intubated on 809 occasions. In the first retrospective study, the clinical use of 491 unweighted tubes was compared with that of fifty 3.5-g weighted tubes. No advantage was found in the use of the weighted tubes. In the second prospective controlled clinical trial, these results were confirmed. Forty-six patients were intubated on 76 occasions with an 85-cm open-ended, unweighted nasogastric feeding tube (Prima, Portex UK), and 57 patients were intubated on 79 occasions with a 91-cm 3.0-g weighted tube (Entriflex, Biosearch, Raritan, NJ). Mean duration of placement was similar in each case, and 62% of both types of tubes were inadvertently removed. Without exception, all the tubes remained in the stomach throughout. Disappointed with the similar and overall performance of both types of tubes, we initiated a design program which resulted in the development of two new nasogastric tubes, one weighted and one unweighted. The tubes were manufactured with polyurethane, rather than polyvinylchloride (PVC), which permitted an increase in diameter of the internal lumen which, in turn, was coated with water-activated lubricant to ease removal of the introducer wire. A specially modeled outflow port was incorporated into the tips of both tubes. The performance of the two new polyurethane nasogastric feeding tubes was assessed under controlled trial conditions; as a reference, a widely used PVC unweighted open-ended tube was used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was conducted to compare the physical stability of 10 TNA systems varied only by the AA solution used. All systems contained electrolytes, vitamins, trace elements, and heparin. The volume ratios of AA, dextrose 70% and lipid emulsion 20% were 1:1:1. Solutions were stored at 4 degrees C for 14 days and then held at ambient temperature for an additional 4 days. Each TNA was serially analyzed on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 for gross visual appearance, pH, osmolality, mean particle diameter, and particle size distribution. The AA solutions evaluated include: Travasol 8.5% and 10%; Aminosyn 8.5% and 10%, Aminosyn RF 5.2%; FreAmine III 8.5% and 10%; FreAmine HBC 6.9%; HepatAmine 8.0%; and NephrAmine 5.4%. The pH values of the Aminosyn solutions were lower than those of other products; however, the pH values of all TNA systems were greater than 5.7, which supported particle stability. The osmolality was not affected by the AA solutions. Based upon particle size distribution, 95% of all particles were less than 0.608 micron in diameter, with means ranging from 0.286 micron to 0.309 micron. The largest particle observed by light microscopy was 6.9 micron. These data indicate that TNA systems prepared with the 10 AA solutions and Soyacal 20% are physically stable.\r"

The rats were separated into three groups (n = 24 in each group). Each group was divided into two populations fed either intragastrically or intravenously. Each group received one of the following nutrients: a 20% Intralipid emulsion, a mixture (1:1, V/V) of Intralipid 20% and Vamine N containing 25% glucose (W/V), a solution of Vamine-glucose supplemented with fructose to reach a final concentration of 20% (W/V). Sham-operated rats that received laboratory chow orally were used as controls. The daily caloric intake was 0.21 to 0.22 kcal/g body weight. The studies on villus morphology and on brush border enzyme activities were performed on the proximal part of the jejunum. For all nutrients, intragastric infusion provoked an increase in the villus height. The lipids were the only nutrients to cause villus lengthening by the intravenous route. Intragastric or intravenous infusion of fat provoked a deficiency in intestinal disaccharidases; the presence of carbohydrates in the diet inhibited this effect slightly. Carbohydrates given alone, either intragastrically or intravenously, caused an elevation of lactase activity. Independent of diet composition, aminopeptidase activity was reduced after intravenous feeding. In conclusion, the disaccharidase activities are largely dependent on changes occurring in the nutrient composition given either intragastrically or intravenously, whereas amino-peptidase activity was related to the route of diet administration.\r"

The admixtures were stored at room temperature and samples for quantitative microbiology were taken at time 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr. K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa were able to proliferate in central TNAs, but the growth of these organisms was retarded in conventional TPN solutions. In the peripheral formulations, K. pneumoniae and E. coli proliferated in both the TNA and conventional TPN systems, whereas P. aeruginosa grew well only in the peripheral TNA. S. epidermidis was not able to grow in any admixtures tested; however, C. albicans grew well in all admixtures, but growth was slower in the conventional central TPN. In conclusion, peripheral and central TNAs supported the growth of microorganisms significantly better than conventional TPN solutions.\r"

Before albumin infusion, plasma levels of AVP, PRA, PA and noradrenaline (NA) and urinary excretion of PGE2, PGE-Met, PGF2 alpha were elevated. The mean value of plasma ANP was in the normal range. Albumin infusion produced a 36% increase in the calculated plasma volume. It was associated with a fivefold rise in the plasma level of ANP (31.6 +/- 22.6 vs. 151.4 +/- 52 fmol/ml mean, SD), and a significant fall in the levels of PRA, AVP, PA, and NA. Similarly, urinary concentration of PGE2, PGE-Met and PGF2 alpha fell. Urine flow, GFR, UNaV, FENa, and COsm increased significantly, while CH2O remained unchanged. The diuresis, natriuresis and GFR correlated with the level of plasma ANP, while urinary sodium excretion did not correlate with PA or NA levels. These findings suggest that ANP plays an important role in albumin induced natriuresis in children with nephrotic syndrome.\r"

Fasting lysine flux was determined by a primed 4-hour continuous infusion of 14C-lysine before and after one month of hydrazine treatment. Baseline plasma lysine flux was 2580 (SD 580) mumol/h for the placebo group and 2510 (440) mumol/h for the hydrazine group. After one month the placebo group showed a slight rise to 2920 (450) mumol/h (p = 0.08) and the hydrazine group showed a significant fall to 1840 (750) mumol/h (p less than 0.05); serum albumin fell in the placebo group and was unchanged in the hydrazine group. Administration of hydrazine sulphate to reduce aminoacid flux may favourably influence the metabolic abnormalities in cancer cachexia.\r"

  ".U": "87285880\r", 
  ".W": "This hypothesis, presented to explain the cerebral oedema that sometimes occurs during treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), is based on activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger, a ubiquitous plasma-membrane transport system that functions in the regulation of cytoplasmic pH. Experimental acidification of the cytoplasm with weak organic acids activates the exchanger and, in the presence of extracellular Na+, leads to cell swelling. This swelling is osmotic, secondary to a net gain in Na+ and the anion of the weak organic acid. In DKA, cytoplasmic acidification results from high levels of circulating weak organic acids (ketoacids and free fatty acids) and activation of Na+/H+ exchange would similarly be expected. Conditions during conventional treatment of DKA should favour even greater activation of the exchanger and additional cell swelling would be predicted. The hypothesis is consistent with the clinical observation that clinically apparent cerebral oedema occurs with improvement in the patient's acid-base status rather than at the peak of the ketoacidosis.\r"

In tubal microsurgery, the CO2 laser can be used as a scalpel with the predominant advantage of minimal tissular alterations. As a result of this study, our recommended parameters are the following: radiation power, 7-10 W; beam focalization zone, 0.2 mm; energy density, 20,000-35,000 W/cm2; continuous operation; moving speed, 1 cm/s.\r"

We used the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) to deplete TRH from the ventral horn of the spinal cord of adult rats to determine whether the tripeptide may be trophic to the AMN. The rats were studied blindly and sequentially for 11 weeks. Motor performance remained normal by clinical and electrophysiologic assessments. AMN counts were not reduced in the lumbar cord, and gastrocnemius muscle showed no evidence of denervation in treated rats. We conclude that in the adult rat chronic ventral horn TRH deficiency does not lead to AMN degeneration and is not associated with a significant alteration of AMN function.\r"

Increased MLC-3 level was observed in muscular dystrophies. There were significant positive correlations between serum levels of MLC-3 and creatine kinase (CK) in Duchenne and limb-girdle type muscular dystrophy, but the regression lines were different. Patients with neurogenic amyotrophy, especially amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also showed elevated MLC-3 levels with or without high CK, and the frequency of increase in MLC-3 was greater than that of CK. The results of the present study suggest that circulating MLC might be a useful marker for muscle breakdown not merely in myopathies but in neurogenic disorders.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the efficacy of immediate coronary angioplasty after acute myocardial infarction with that of elective angioplasty at 7 to 10 days in patients treated initially with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. The plasminogen activator (150 mg) was administered 2.95 +/- 1.1 hours after the onset of symptoms, to 386 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Ninety minutes later, patency of the coronary artery serving the area of the infarct was demonstrated by coronary angiography in 288 patients (75 percent). Bleeding problems were frequently encountered, as evidenced by an average drop in hematocrit of 11.7 +/- 6.5 points from base line to nadir and by a need for transfusion not related to bypass surgery in 70 patients (18 percent). After successful thrombolysis, 197 patients with a patent but severely stenotic vessel suitable for angioplasty were randomly assigned to immediate angioplasty (n = 99) or, if indicated 7 to 10 days after infarction, to deferred (elective) angioplasty (n = 98). The incidence of reocclusion was similar in the two groups: 11 percent in the group assigned to immediate angioplasty and 13 percent in the group assigned to elective angioplasty. Neither group had a significant improvement in global left ventricular function, and regional wall motion in the infarct zone improved to a similar extent in the two groups. In the elective-angioplasty group, the rate of crossover to emergency angioplasty for recurrent ischemia was 16 percent (whereas 5 percent of the immediate-angioplasty group required emergency repeated angioplasty; P = 0.01). In 14 percent of the patients in the elective group, the stenosis was substantially reduced by the time of the seven-day follow-up angiography, obviating the need for angioplasty. We conclude that in patients with initially successful thrombolysis and suitable coronary-artery anatomy, immediate angioplasty offers no clear advantage over delayed elective angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "One of the earliest molecular signs of segmentation in Drosophila embryos is the striped expression of some pair-rule genes during the blastoderm stage. Two of these genes, fushi-tarazu (ftz) and even-skipped (eve) are expressed during this stage in complementary patterns of seven stripes which develop and disappear in concert. Here, we map the cells expressing each of these two pair-rule genes with respect to the 14 stripes of cells expressing the engrailed gene. We find that both ftz and eve generate stripes which have sharp boundaries at the anterior margin, but fade away posteriorly. The anterior boundaries correspond cell by cell with the anterior boundaries of expression of the engrailed gene. We therefore suggest that a key function of early ftz and eve gene activity is the formation of a sharp stable boundary at the anterior margin of each stripe. These boundary lines, rather than the narrowing zonal stripes, would delimit the anterior boundaries of engrailed and other homoeotic genes and thereby subdivide the embryo into parasegments.\r"

  ".W": "The best-understood protein structure involved in DNA binding is the helix-turn-helix motif. A second DNA-binding domain, the finger structure, has been proposed on the basis of sequence analysis, partial proteolysis and zinc content of Xenopus transcription factor TFIIIA. Other eukaryotic proteins were subsequently found to contain contiguous repeat units of the postulated finger motif. Each repeat unit contains thirty amino acids and is thought to bind a zinc atom using two cysteines and two histidines as ligands. The protein loop or finger between apparent zinc ligands is rich in DNA-binding residues and is thought to make specific contacts with DNA. The yeast protein ADR1, a positive regulator of transcription of the gene ADH2, contains two finger domains in a region of the protein required for transcriptional activation. Nineteen independently isolated adr1 mutations induced by hydroxylamine were found at nine different amino-acid positions, seven of which are in the two finger domains. All four mutations that altered invariant cysteine or histidine residues led to an adr1 null phenotype. Only one other mutation caused an adr1 null phenotype. Thus, one finger domain is not sufficient for ADR1 activity. This provides the first evidence that, as is consistent with the proposed model, the invariant cysteine and histidine residues are essential for the formation of the finger structure.\r"

  ".W": "Phase-dependent forms of microscopy (such as phase contrast, interference, or polarization microscopy) have been used for many years; the amount of phase retardation produces images based mainly on index of refraction. We have developed a microscope that forms images that depend on small differences in extinction for different forms of incident polarized light. By modulating the polarization of light incident on the sample and digitally recording the difference in intensities of transmitted light, we obtain images which specifically reveal either ordered linear structures or chiral (right- or left-handed) structures. Linearly polarized light, incident alternately with two perpendicular directions of polarization, forms images of structures which have linear order or linear orientation. Right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized light incident alternately on a sample forms images of chiral structures. Structures with neither linear order nor chirality are essentially invisible. Thus, images based on linear dichroism, circular dichroism, and linear and circular differential scattering can be used to detect specific types of structures which may be difficult to observe by conventional methods. We have used such 'linear and circular differential imaging' to study the structure of the nucleolus (the site of RNA synthesis) in live primary spermatocytes of Drosophila when they are transcriptionally active or inactive. Some inactive nucleoli are bipartite, with two distinct structures visible by differential scattering of both linearly and circularly polarized light. The active nucleolus is a single domain; it is clearly distinguished from part of the Y chromosome, and it shows different internal structure with linearly and circularly polarized light. Thus, polarization-dependent images reveal structures which can be associated with the transcriptional activity of cells.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction between membrane proteins and cytoplasmic structural proteins is thought to be one mechanism for maintaining the spatial order of proteins within functional domains on the plasma membrane. Such interactions have been characterized extensively in the human erythrocyte, where a dense, cytoplasmic matrix of proteins comprised mainly of spectrin and actin, is attached through a linker protein, ankyrin, to the anion transporter (Band 3). In several nonerythroid cell types, including neurons, exocrine cells and polarized epithelial cells homologues of ankyrin and spectrin (fodrin) are localized in specific membrane domains. Although these results suggest a functional linkage between ankyrin and fodrin and integral membrane proteins in the maintenance of membrane domains in nonerythroid cells, there has been little direct evidence of specific molecular interactions. Using a direct biological and chemical approach, we show here that ankyrin binds to the ubiquitous (Na+ + K+)ATPase, which has an asymmetrical distribution in polarized cells.\r"

  ".U": "87287250\r", 
  ".W": "Mature T cells segregate phenotypically into one of two classes: those that express the surface glycoprotein CD4, and those that express the glycoprotein CD8. The CD4 molecule is expressed primarily on helper T cells whereas CD8 is found on cytotoxic and suppressor cells. A more stringent association exists, however, between these T-cell subsets and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products recognized by their T-cell receptors (TCRs). CD8+ lymphocytes interact with targets expressing class I MHC gene products, whereas CD4+ cells interact with class II MHC-bearing targets. To explain this association, it has been proposed that these 'accessory' molecules bind to monomorphic regions of the MHC proteins on the target cell, CD4 to class II and CD8 to class I products. This binding could hold the T cell and its target together, thus improving the probability of the formation of the trimolecular antigen: MHC: TCR complex. Because the TCR on CD4+ cells binds antigen in association with class II MHC, it has been difficult to design experiments to detect the association of CD4 with a class II molecule. To address this issue, we devised a xenogeneic system in which human CD4 complementary DNA was transfected into the murine CD4-, CD8- T-cell hybridoma 3DT-52.5.8, the TCR of which recognizes the murine class I molecule H-2Dd. The murine H-2Dd-bearing target cell line, P815, was cotransfected with human class II HLA-DR alpha, beta and invariant chain cDNAs. Co-culture of the parental T-cell and P815 lines, or of one parental and one transfected line resulted in a low baseline response. In contrast, a substantial increase in response was observed when CD4+ 3DT-52.5.8 cells were co-cultured with HLA-DR+ P815 cells. This result strongly indicates that CD4:HLA-DR binding occurs in this system and that this interaction augments T-cell activation.\r"

Expression of c-fos and c-myc are among the earliest genetic events induced in cultured fibroblast and phaeochromocytoma cell lines by various stimuli including growth factors, peptides and the intracellular second messengers diacylglycerol, cAMP and Ca2+. We report here that physiological stimulation of rat primary sensory neurons causes the expression of c-fos-protein-like immunoreactivity in nuclei of postsynaptic neurons of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Activation of small-diameter cutaneous sensory afferents by noxious heat or chemical stimuli results in the rapid appearance of c-fos-protein-like immunoreactivity in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn. However, activation of low-threshold cutaneous afferents results in fewer labelled cells with a different laminar distribution. No c-fos induction was seen in the dorsal root ganglia, gracile nucleus or ventral horn. Thus, synaptic transmission may induce rapid changes in gene expression in certain postsynaptic neurons.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and noradrenaline (NA) interact synergistically to increase cyclic AMP levels in mouse cerebral cortical slices. The pharmacological mechanism of this synergism is the potentiation by NA, through alpha 1 adrenergic receptors, of the stimulatory effect of VIP on cAMP formation. A similar interaction has been confirmed in guinea pig cerebral cortex and in discrete nuclei of the rat hypothalamus. Furthermore VIP and NA interact synergistically to depress the spontaneous activity of identified neurons in rat neocortex. At the cellular level, this synergistic interaction suggests that VIP- and NA-containing neuronal systems may converge, at least in part, on the same target cells to increase cAMP levels in the cerebral cortex. At the molecular level, the interaction may occur at various steps in signal transduction, between receptors, intramembrane transduction processes or intracellular effector mechanisms. Here we report that the alpha 1-adrenergic potentiation of the increases in cAMP elicited by VIP involves the formation of arachidonic acid metabolites and is mimicked by prostglandins F2 alpha and E2.\r"

Levels of immunoreactive corticotrophin releasing factor (irCRF), immunoreactive adrenocorticotropic hormone (irACTH) and cortisol concentrations in maternal plasma are elevated throughout gestation, increase further during labour and fall precipitously after parturition. The placenta contains biologically active CRF and ACTH and it has been suggested that the placenta produces these peptides during pregnancy. Here we show that irCRF is located in the cytotrophoblast cells of placenta collected at term. Using a monolayer primary culture of human placental cells we have found that CRF stimulates secretion of peptides containing the ACTH sequence in the placenta in a dose-dependent manner, as it does in the pituitary. This effect is reversed by a CRF antagonist and is mimicked by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and forskolin. Glucocorticoids, which suppress the secretion of pituitary ACTH, were found to have no influence on release of irACTH by the placenta. Oxytocin and prostaglandins stimulate irACTH and irCRF secretion from cultured placental cells and the irACTH-releasing activity of two prostaglandins is partially reversed by a CRF antagonist. Thus CRF may be involved in the paracrine regulation of placental irACTH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Endocytosis of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded class I and class II molecules has been the subject of recent investigations. Class I molecules, which are key elements in T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, are differentially endocytosed by different cell types. Fibroblasts internalize their class I molecules via uncoated cell surface vesicles and tubular invaginations when these molecules are cross-linked with multivalent ligands. T lymphocytes internalize their class I molecules spontaneously, but B lymphocytes do not internalize them at all. Here we describe a morphological investigation of the mechanism by which class I molecules are endocytosed by T lymphocytes. We show that, unlike fibroblasts, T lymphocytes spontaneously internalize 20-40% of their class I molecules in a process involving coated pits and coated vesicles. Thus, the endocytic pathway of class I molecules in T lymphocytes is similar to those of other more classical cell-surface receptors involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. In contrast, the same class I molecules remained on the cell surface in B lymphocytes. These data show that class I molecules are differentially regulated in T and B lymphocytes and fibroblasts.\r"

The AVMs had rapid circulation times with early draining veins on angiography. Local cortical blood flow (lCoBF) was measured with cortically applied thermister/Peltier stack arrays. The AVMs had a more pronounced effect on lCoBF at a 2- to 4-cm distance from the AVM margin than in the adjacent cortex. Mean preexcision lCoBF was 62.9 +/- 6.7 (SE) ml/100 g/minute (i.e., similar to normal controls) near the AVM margin and 43.0 +/- 4.2 ml/100 g/minute far (i.e., greater than 2 cm) from the AVM. CO2 reactivity (COR) before excision was 1.1 +/- 0.3 ml/100 g/minute/torr of CO2 (i.e., similar to normal controls) at near sites and 0.6 +/- 0.3 ml/100 g/minute/torr of CO2 at far sites. The mean postexcision near lCoBF remained stable at 55.8 +/- 5.1 ml/100 g/minute at near sites, but the far lCoBF significantly increased (P less than 0.05) to 57.2 +/- 6.8 ml/100 g/minute. The cortical feeding artery pressure was substantially below the normal cortical artery pressure in 50% of the cases studied. Pressure in these arteries normalized after occlusion and AVM excision, resulting in a rapid increase in cortical artery perfusion pressure. Draining red vein pressure, which was elevated before AVM excision, also dropped after excision, contributing to the increase in perfusion pressure. Two patients who developed the normal perfusion pressure breakthrough syndrome (PBS) after operation had low lCoBF and disturbed COR before AVM excision and marked increase of lCoBF after excision.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the delivery of melanoma-specific radiolabeled monoclonal antibody (MAb) Fab fragments in a pilot study of three patients with melanoma metastatic to the central nervous system. Tumor samples demonstrated excellent immunohistochemical reactivity with Fab 96.5, specific for a 97,000-molecular-weight melanoma antigen (p97), or Fab 48.7, specific for a melanoma-associated proteoglycan antigen. All three patients received 131I-labeled tumor-specific Fab (5 to 7 mg, 1 mCi/mg) intravenously. On a separate occasion, two patients received 131I-labeled nonspecific Fab (5 to 7 mg, 1 mCi/mg). There was no uptake of either antibody into the region of the tumor (as documented by gamma camera brain images). However, there was increased uptake in the blood-brain barrier (BBB)-modified areas in all three patients when radiolabeled tumor-specific MAb was administered intravenously in conjunction with osmotic BBB opening. In one patient, the estimated cerebrovascular permeability X capillary surface area (PA) for the tumor-bearing hemisphere 3 hours after disruption was 1.16 X 10(-6) sec-1 compared to the PA of 0.395 X 10(-6) sec-1 in the nondisrupted hemisphere. Serial brain scans showed that greater than 90% of the radiolabeled antibody cleared from the brain by 72 hours. The highest radiation doses (rads) calculated per 7 mCi injection were: left brain (barrier-modified hemisphere), 5.46; right brain (non-barrier modified hemisphere), 1.68; thyroid, 98; stomach, 9.1; kidney, 39.9; and total body, 1.33. There seemed to be increased uptake of antibody in the tumor region after barrier modification in one patient, but antibody clearance from that region occurred at the same rate as from surrounding and apparently tumor-free brain. In one patient who had carcinomatous meningitis, we demonstrated antibody bound to only a fraction of the antigen binding sites on tumor cells in the cerebrospinal fluid after BBB modification. We have not shown distinct, persistent localization of antibody in brain tumor; studies investigating MAb dose and other parameters as the basis for this problem are under way.\r"

PrP monoclonal antibodies and monospecific anti-PrP peptide sera, which react with both the cellular (PrPC) and scrapie (PrPSc) isoforms of the prion protein, were used to locate PrP in tissue sections. In normal hamsters, PrPC was located primarily in nerve cell bodies throughout the CNS; whereas, in the terminal stages of scrapie, PrP immunoreactivity was shifted to the neuropil and was absent from most nerve cell bodies. Prion proteins were not uniformly dispersed throughout the gray matter of scrapie-infected hamster brains; rather, they were concentrated in those regions that exhibited spongiform degeneration and reactive astrogliosis. Since earlier studies showed that the level of PrPC remains constant during scrapie infection as measured in whole brain homogenates and no antibodies are presently available that can distinguish PrPC from PrPSc, we analyzed individual brain regions by Western blotting. Analysis of proteinase K-digested homogenates of dissected brain regions showed that most of the regional changes in PrP immunoreactivity that are seen during scrapie infection are due to the accumulation of PrPSc. These observations indicate that the tissue pathology of scrapie can be directly correlated with the accumulation of PrPSc in the neuropil, and they suggest that the synthesis and distribution of the prion protein has a central role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.\r"

The complete medical history of potential cases, available through the records-linkage system for residents of Rochester, MN, was independently reviewed by three neurologists who agreed upon the diagnosis. All AS patients who were residents of Rochester at time of diagnosis between 1935 and 1979, and who were born in this community, were included (N = 30). Two population controls (born in Rochester) were matched to each patient, and for both patients and controls, the records-linkage system was used to obtain information about possible risk factors. The only factor significantly more common in cases than in controls was a history of febrile seizures (odds ratio = 12; p less than 0.01). We suggest that these febrile seizures represent either an early manifestation of the convulsive diathesis or the symptom of a preexisting brain dysfunction. None of the other factors investigated reached statistical significance, including those that have been previously suggested such as twin pregnancy, breech presentation at delivery, being first-born, and perinatal asphyxia. Sample size limitations should be considered in interpreting these findings.\r"

The MS patients were characterized by higher levels of free kappa chains; free kappa:free lambda chain ratio; free kappa chain:albumin ratio; and IgG:albumin ratio. There were no differences in the level of free lambda chains or absolute concentration of IgG. A significant correlation was observed between free kappa chains and total IgG in MS and between free lambda chains and total IgG in infections, suggesting that the immune response was predominantly IgG-kappa in MS and IgG-lambda in infections.\r"

  ".W": "Without peritreatment antibiotics, infectious flare-ups (about 15% incidence) and serious sequelae follow endodontic treatment of asymptomatic teeth with necrotic pulps and associated periapical lesions. Antibiotics administered after endodontic treatment (4-day regimen) reduce the flare-up incidence to about 2%, but hypersensitivity responses, sensitization, resistant microbes, and drug-taking compliance are potential problems. To ascertain whether a specific prophylactic antibiotic (high-dose, 1-day regimen) would preferentially maintain this low flare-up incidence while overcoming antibiotic-related problems, 315 patients with quiescent pulpal necrosis and an associated periapical lesion were randomly given either penicillin V or erythromycin (base or stearate). Evaluations of flare-up after endodontic treatment were done at 1 day, 1 week, and 2 months. A 2.2% flare-up incidence was found, with no statistically significant differences for penicillin (0.0%), base (2.9%), and stearate (3.8%). No hypersensitivity responses occurred. Gastrointestinal side effects were found primarily with the erythromycins (12.4%). A comparative analysis of the data from our first study (no peritreatment antibiotics) and the pooled data from our last two investigations (including the current trial) showed that peritreatment antibiotic coverage significantly reduced flare-ups and serious sequelae after endodontic treatment (p less than 0.001).\r"

Intense, often dramatic, vasospasm of the internal carotid artery, however, is not infrequently observed in the removal of skull-base lesions. This myogenic reaction is independent of autonomic innervation, occurs more frequently in younger patients, and appears to be due mainly to longitudinal arterial traction and prolonged arterial contact with fresh blood. A case of severe internal carotid artery spasm, which led to a fatal stroke in a young woman who underwent removal of a large glomus jugulare tumor, is presented to emphasize not only the lethal potential of carotid spasm, but intraoperative changes in the character of the artery which suggest the need for immediate spasmolysis. Perioperative guidelines for the prevention and treatment of arterial spasm--including topical and systemic pharmacotherapy and refined surgical techniques--are outlined on the basis of our subsequent experience.\r"

Despite a history of radiation in four of the five, all flaps have healed and complications have been minimal. The key to success seems to be careful attention to the venous drainage.

Ipsilateral labeling of the solitary tract nucleus was seen. The caudal extent of the labeling varied with age. Sensory labeling of the nucleus ambiguus was present bilaterally in three younger animals and unilaterally in older piglets. Bilateral labeling of the nucleus dorsomedialis was seen in all ages. Apneic and cardiovascular response to water stimulation of laryngeal mucosa and the laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR) were examined in 16 piglets. Blunting of the apneic and cardiovascular response was seen after sacrifice of a single SLN. Hypoxia did not significantly affect the LAR or apnea duration in animals with only one intact SLN. A contralateral LAR was found in younger animals. Relevance to the LCR is also discussed.\r"

Contrary to findings by silver impregnation, intraepithelial free nerve endings were more frequently observed on the lower surface of the vocal cord. The taste bud-like structures were classified into two different types: simple terminations and reticular terminations, according to the mode of the SP immunoreactive nerve fiber. Immature or degenerated taste bud-like structures in the larynx were assumed to be mechanical receptors because these receptors lacked outer taste pores and taste hairs.\r"

  ".W": "Most experienced head and neck surgeons recommend aggressive treatment--including radical surgery--for patients with resectable Stage IV cancers. Yet, given the poor overall cure rate of 15% and the deformity and disability often associated with treatment, one of the most frequently asked questions at our conference on tumors was: Are we really helping these patients? We found little data in the relevant literature to answer this or other questions. Are there subgroups with a better outlook? What is the evidence for palliation in the 85% of patients who fail treatment and how is it best achieved? How do patients and their families view their treatment in retrospect? To find the answers, we studied the records of 76 consecutive patients (previously untreated) who presented with Stage IV carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract in 1981-82. We also interviewed surviving patients or family members and friends by phone. Overall mean survival was 15 months, with a 2-year disease-free survival rate of 16%. More to the point, resectable patients treated with curative intent had a mean survival of 19.4 months, and 12 of 42 patients (29%) were disease-free at 2 years. Patients with laryngeal cancer had the best survival results, and patients with sinus cancers had the worst (25.2 vs. 10.5 months). Those with N2A staging lived longer than other groups (24.1 vs. 12.1 months). T4 lesions portend a particularly poor prognosis; mean survival was just 7.5 months and only 1 of 28 patients (3.6%) was alive and disease-free at 2 years. Twenty-five percent of patients returned to normal function, but 75% had significant problems eating or speaking.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Urine and (when available) cerebrospinal fluid specimens were saved for all patients. Positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture isolates included 36 with H. influenzae type b, 11 with S. pneumoniae, 3 with N. meningitidis and 6 with other organisms. All latex kits performed similarly for the detection of H. influenzae type b antigen with a sensitivity range of 91 to 100%. The four methods performed poorly for the detection of S. pneumoniae (23 to 50%) and N. meningitidis (0%) antigen. Gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid appeared to be equally sensitive to the antigen detection methods for patients with meningitis. The false positive rates for the latex kits and counterimmunoelectrophoresis ranged from 2.8 to 9.2%, with Wellcogen having the lowest rates. The false negative rates ranged from 6.5% to 12% with Directigen having the lowest rate.\r"

Although subtle, these changes may alter a child's ability to perform well in school and in society. Physicians must prevent seizures without producing intolerable side effects, and ways of more appropriately assessing these side effects must be developed. In this double-blind, counter-balanced, crossover study of 21 children, the effects of phenobarbital and valproic acid on cognitive functioning and behavior were measured. There was no difference in seizure control between the drugs, and each medication was maintained in the therapeutic range for 6 months (mean phenobarbital level, 21.2 micrograms/mL; mean valproic acid level, 94.1 micrograms/mL). Children were treated with each drug for 6 months. Differences between the drugs were seen on measurements of cognitive function and behavior. On four tests of neuropsychologic function, children performed significantly less well while receiving phenobarbital (P less than .01). There was no evidence that the patients were sedated or less able to perform continuous performance tasks while receiving phenobarbital. Parental assessment of behavior indicated significantly worse behavior with the phenobarbital regimen for three items (P less than .01) and children were measurably more \"hyperactive\" (P less than .05). Routine clinical assessment of the patients did not reveal differences between the drugs with respect to routine laboratory measurements or side effects as assessed by history or physical examination. Although children may appear to tolerate a medication without clinically apparent problems, subtle but significant changes in intellectual function and behavior may be occurring. Additional, more sensitive, methods of monitoring patients while receiving these drugs is necessary.\r"

Two of them were first cousins. All patients had Leydig cell deficiency. Among 15 patients who received luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone stimulation during childhood, 11 had an exaggerated response of either one or both gonadotropins. Bilateral biopsy, performed in eight patients, showed a clearly testicular structure with either scant or incompletely differentiated tubules. These characteristics allow clear differentiation from chromosomal abnormalities and malformation syndromes. It is more difficult to differentiate between rudimentary testes and primary gonadotropic deficiencies and may not be possible until the child has reached adolescence. The syndrome of rudimentary testes may be a manifestation of XY primary gonadal dysplasia, along with pure XY gonadal dysgenesis, XY hermaphroditism, XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis, and congenital anorchia, probably resulting from fetal regression of the testes. The observed familial occurrence of the syndrome of rudimentary testes, as well as of XY gonadal dysgenesis, leads to speculation about the possibility of X-linked transmission.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty infants, 2 to 6 months of age, were vaccinated with Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide covalently linked to an outer membrane protein from Neisseria meningitidis group B. Subjects were given two injections and were randomly assigned to receive the injections separated by 1 or 2 months. Each dose contained 15 micrograms of polysaccharide and 51 micrograms of protein, or approximately twice the amount of polysaccharide as used in our previous trial (Lancet 1986;2:299). Fevers of 38.0 degrees to 38.8 degrees C developed in three infants (6%) within 24 hours after vaccination, but there were no other notable reactions. Following one injection, the geometric mean antibody concentration increased from 0.13 micrograms/mL in preimmune serum to 1.50 micrograms/mL in serum obtained 1 to 2 months later (P less than .001). After a second injection, there was a further increase in serum antibody (geometric mean = 3.11 micrograms/mL, P less than .007). The geometric mean antibody concentration of the group reimmunized 2 months after the first injection was higher than that in the group reimmunized after 1 month (3.95 v 2.32 micrograms/mL, P = .05, by analysis of covariance with age as the covariant). These data confirm our previous preliminary observations on the safety and immunogenicity of this new conjugate vaccine in infants 2 to 6 months of age. The data suggest that a 2-month interval between the first and second injections results in higher levels of serum antibody than a 1-month interval.\r"

For example, a miliary pattern suggests miliary tuberculosis, but it may also be caused by several noninfectious diseases (table 1). Other clues, such as the presence or absence of fever, must also be considered to arrive at a likely diagnosis. Cavitary lesions, bilateral hilar adenopathy, pleural effusions, and pulmonary nodules are other findings that are commonly seen on the chest film of these patients. Possible infectious and noninfectious causes are listed in tables 2 through 5. Antimicrobial therapy that is appropriate, free from side effects, and cost-effective must be chosen. The frequency of administration of a drug can make a great difference in the total cost of treatment, since hospitals charge for each intravenous dose. The clinician should consider which drug is effective against the infective organism and also the least expensive to administer (table 6).\r"

However, a potent exonuclease can be detected after separating the 182-kDa polymerase subunit from the other three subunits of the enzyme (73, 60, and 50 kDa) by glycerol gradient sedimentation in the presence of 50% ethylene glycol. The exonuclease activity cosediments with the polymerase subunit, suggesting that the two activities reside in the same polypeptide. The 3'----5' exonuclease excises mismatched bases at the 3' termini of primed synthetic and natural DNA templates. Excision of a mispaired base at the 3' terminus occurs at a 10-fold greater rate than excision of the correctly paired base. When replication fidelity is measured by the bacteriophage phi X174 am3 reversion assay, the isolated polymerase subunit is at least 100-fold more accurate than either the intact polymerase-primase or a complex of the 182- and 73-kDa subunits. These results suggest that the 3'----5' exonuclease functions as a proofreading enzyme during Drosophila DNA replication in vitro and very likely in vivo.\r"

This protein was specifically immunoprecipitated by an anti-ricin or anti-B-chain antibody and the amount of recombinant B chain secreted by the COS-M6 cells was determined by a radioimmunoassay. Virtually all of the recombinant B chain formed active ricin when mixed with native A chain; it could also bind to the galactose-containing glycoprotein asialofetuin as effectively as native B chain. These results indicate that the vast majority of recombinant B chains secreted into the medium of the COS-M6 cells retain biological function.\r"

Three clones containing inserts of 3.3, 2.7, and 2.3 kilobases were selected for further analysis. Three overlapping clones containing 17.8 kilobases of the human elastin gene were also isolated from genomic libraries. Complete sequence analysis of the six clones demonstrated that: the cDNA encompassed the entire translated portion of the mRNA encoding 786 amino acids, including several unusual hydrophilic amino acid sequences not previously identified in porcine tropoelastin, exons encoding either hydrophobic or crosslinking domains in the protein alternated in the gene, and a great abundance of Alu repetitive sequences occurred throughout the introns. The data also indicated substantial alternative splicing of the mRNA. These results suggest the potential for significant variation in the precise molecular structure of the elastic fiber in the human population.\r"

  ".U": "87289669\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of 8-bromo-cGMP on intracellular calcium concentrations in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells were studied. Both angiotensin II and depolarizing concentrations of K+ stimulated Ca2+ accumulation in the cytoplasm. The increase in Ca2+ due to angiotensin II was associated with an increase in inositol phosphates, while that due to K+ was not. Preincubation of cells with 8-bromo-cGMP (100 microM) caused an inhibition of peak Ca2+ accumulation to either angiotensin II or K+. To probe the mechanism of action of cGMP in vascular smooth muscle, the effects of cGMP-dependent protein kinase on Ca2+-ATPase from the cultured cell particulate material were investigated. Ca2+-activated ATPase was stimulated approximately equal to 2-fold by exogenous calmodulin and up to 4-fold by low concentrations of purified cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The inclusion of both calmodulin and cGMP-dependent protein kinase resulted in an additive stimulation of Ca2+-ATPase. Stimulation of Ca2+-ATPase activity was observed at all Ca2+ concentrations tested (0.01-1.0 microM). cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit and protein kinase C were either ineffective or less effective than cGMP-dependent protein kinase in stimulating the Ca2+-ATPase from rat aortic smooth muscle cells. These results suggest a possible mechanism of action for cGMP in mediating decreases in cytosolic Ca2+ through activation of a Ca2+-ATPase and the subsequent removal of Ca2+ from the cell.\r"

To examine the role of these cysteine residues in the activity of the C. acremonium enzyme, we used site-directed in vitro mutagenesis to change these cysteine residues to serine residues. Mutation of Cys-255 reduces specific activity approximately equal to 50%, whereas mutation of Cys-106 or mutation of both Cys-106 and Cys-255 reduces specific activity about 97%. This suggests that the cysteines are important but not essential for IPNS activity. Alkylation of IPNS also almost completely inactivated the enzyme, but residual activity could have been due to incomplete alkylation. Atomic substitution via genetic manipulation in this case is a more accurate means of assessing the role of sulfhydryl moieties in enzyme activity.\r"

UIR is capable of transforming chicken embryo fibroblasts and promoting formation of colonies in soft agar; however, it does not form tumors in vivo. A variant that arose from the parental UIR is capable of efficiently inducing sarcomas in vivo. UIR-transformed cells exhibit higher rates of glucose uptake and growth than normal cells. The 4-kilobase UIR genome codes for a membrane-associated, glycosylated gag-hIR fusion protein of 75 kDa designated P75gag-hir.

AEV encodes two oncogenes, v-erbA and v-erbB, whose products are closely related to the thyroxine receptor and the epidermal growth factor receptor, respectively. Since tyrosine protein kinases have been implicated in the process of normal growth signal transduction, we wished to study the possible consequences of the expression of these mutated, growth-regulating receptor genes on the activity of the cellular tyrosine kinase pp60c-src. A continuous cell line from AEV-infected quail embryo fibroblasts was derived that exhibited a typical transformed phenotype and expressed the viral oncogene products, p75gag-erbA and gp66-68erbB. Using an immune-complex kinase assay, we found that the specific activity of pp60c-src in AEV-transformed quail cells was decreased by a factor of 6-30 relative to that found in uninfected quail cells. A concomitant 50-80% reduction of 32Pi incorporation into the pp60c-src protein from radiolabeled, transformed cells was also observed, indicating a relationship between hypophosphorylation and diminished enzyme activity. Partial proteolytic phosphopeptide analysis revealed a decrease in phosphorylation of both serine- and tyrosine-containing peptides, suggesting an activation of specific phosphatases or inhibition of specific kinases in the AEV-transformed quail cells. Similar results were found in pp60c-src precipitated from AEV-transformed chicken and rat cells.\r"

  ".U": "87289691\r", 
  ".W": "We have investigated the factors that regulate aromatase activity in fetal-neonatal rat ovaries. Ovarian aromatase activity (assessed by measuring the amount of 3H2O) formed from [1 beta-3H]testosterone) is low prior to birth (less than 0.5 pmol/hr per mg of protein) and increases to values greater than 30 pmol/hr per mg of protein between days 8 and 12 after birth. The appearance of ovarian aromatase (postnatal days 2-4) coincides with the development of primordial follicles. Fetal-neonatal ovaries maintained in serum-free organ culture do not develop aromatase activity at the expected time. Ovine follicle-stimulating hormone (0.1-1 microgram/ml), ovine luteinizing hormone (0.1 microgram/ml), or their combination failed to induce the enzyme activity in cultured fetal ovaries, whereas follicle-stimulating hormone is effective in preventing the decline in aromatase activity when postnatal day 8 ovaries are placed in culture. In contrast to follicle-stimulating hormone, dibutyryl-cAMP markedly enhances ovarian aromatase in cultured fetal ovaries. Likewise, enhancement of endogenous cAMP formation with forskolin or cholera toxin caused an increase in enzyme activity within 24 hr. Vasoactive intestinal peptide, a peptide known to occur in ovarian nerves, caused a dose-dependent increase in aromatase activity in fetal ovaries prior to folliculogenesis. Of related peptides tested, only the peptide having N-terminal histidine and C-terminal isoleucine amide was capable of inducing aromatase activity in fetal ovaries. The fact that VIP can induce aromatase activity in fetal rat ovaries prior to follicle formation and prior to responsiveness to follicle-stimulating hormone suggests that this neuropeptide may play a critical role in ovarian differentiation.\r"

  ".U": "87289698\r", 
  ".W": "The structural organization of Drosophila F elements closely resembles that of L1 sequences, a major family of repetitive DNA elements dispersed in the genome of all mammals. Members of both families are flanked by target-site duplications of different length, vary in size because of heterogeneity at one end, and invariably terminate at the other end in characteristic adenosine-rich stretches often preceded by polyadenylylation signals. The nucleotide sequence of Fw, an F element found in the white locus of wi+A flies, reveals a large open reading frame upstream of the 3' adenosine-rich terminus encoding a possible reverse transcriptase homologous to those potentially encoded by functional L1 units and Drosophila I factors. A cysteine-rich region within an interrupted frame located at the 5' terminus of Fw suggests that complete F elements might additionally encode a nucleic acid binding protein. The observation that F elements and I factors encode functionally related polypeptides, and the extensive similarity of their hypothetical reverse transcriptases to L1 open reading frames, favors the hypothesis that all these sequences are evolutionarily related and transpose upon the cDNA conversion of RNA intermediates.\r"

  ".U": "87289714\r", 
  ".W": "Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is an endocrine tumor of the thyroid C cells that expresses high levels of the neuroendocrine peptide hormone calcitonin. During tumor progression in the host, there is an apparent loss of differentiation in MTC cells that involves a consistent decrease in calcitonin content of the tumor cells associated with decreased expression of the calcitonin gene and/or changes in a mRNA alternative-processing pattern away from that characteristic of the parent thyroid C cell. We now report that introduction of the viral Harvey ras (v-Ha-ras) oncogene into cultured human MTC cells can reverse such changes in gene expression and can induce endocrine differentiation of the tumor cells. The expression of v-Ha-ras is associated with decreased cellular proliferation and DNA synthesis. There is a marked increase in the number of cytoplasmic secretory granules that are a classic feature of differentiated thyroid C cells. v-Ha-ras expression induces increased expression of the calcitonin gene and the processing of the primary gene transcript is shifted to favor calcitonin mRNA rather than calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) mRNA production. These studies with cultured human MTC cells provide a model system to study the role of Ha-ras and related genes in neuroendocrine differentiation. The findings suggest an important approach for identifying genes in solid tumors whose altered expression may play a role in the impaired maturational capacity characteristic of cancer cells during tumor progression.\r"

Marrow cells isolated by an immunoadherence technique with the HPCA-1 (human progenitor cell antigen) monoclonal antibody after removal of contaminating T cells and macrophages formed erythroid colonies in methyl cellulose media in the presence of ATG at concentrations of 25-50 micrograms/ml. ATG also stimulated continuous production of hemoglobin-containing erythroid colonies beyond 35 days of culture when it was added to the culture weekly. ATG also had an indirect effect on myeloid (granulocytic and macrophagic) colony growth in vitro. At a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, ATG stimulated late but not early myeloid progenitor cells to form mature colonies. This effect required the participation of lymphocytes containing the Leu-11 antigen and macrophages or supernatant fluids made from these two types of cells that had been preincubated with ATG for 3 hr and then cultured for 5 additional days. The supernatant fluids produced in such a manner showed characteristics similar to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and had an activity peak that eluted at a volume corresponding to a 20,000 Da molecular mass protein by high-resolution liquid chromatography.\r"

To study these processes directly, we measured [Ca2+]i in perfused ferret (Mustela putorius furo) hearts using 19F NMR spectroscopy to detect the 5,5'-difluoro derivative of the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). To load cells, hearts were perfused with the acetoxymethyl ester derivative of 5,5'-F2-BAPTA. We measured 19F NMR spectra and left ventricular pressure simultaneously, at rest and during pacing at various external Ca concentrations [( Ca]o). Although contractile force was attenuated by the Ca2+ buffering properties of 5,5'-F2-BAPTA, the decrease in pressure could be overcome by raising [Ca]o. Our mean value of 104 nM for [Ca2+]i at rest in the perfused heart agrees well with previous measurements in isolated ventricular muscle. During pacing at 0.6-4 Hz, time-averaged [Ca2+]i increased; the effect of pacing was augmented by increasing [Ca]o. [Ca2+]i more than tripled during 10-20 min of global ischemia, and returned toward control levels upon reperfusion. This approach promises to be particularly useful in investigating the physiology of intact hearts and the pathophysiology of alterations in the coronary circulation.\r"

These values were partitioned into quartiles for two knee positions. Women with \"loose\" plantar flexor muscles comprised the first quartile, and those with \"tight\" plantar flexor muscles the fourth quartile. Tight- and loose-muscle groups were established for the 0-degree (fully extended) and 90-degree (flexed) knee test positions for data analysis. Torque measurements were obtained using an isokinetic testing apparatus. We asked each subject to perform a maximal isometric (static) plantar flexion contraction at each of three ankle positions: 7 degrees of dorsiflexion (angle A), 0 degrees or neutral (angle B), and 30 degrees of plantar flexion (angle C). Data analysis was performed using an analysis of variance for repeated measures. Results indicated that torque produced by the tight-muscle groups was significantly greater than the torque produced by the loose-muscle groups at both knee positions (p less than .05). Additionally, the ankle ROM data obtained suggest normative data different from those currently prevalent in the literature. Findings of this study may prove valuable in the rehabilitation of ankle injuries and could be beneficial especially to physical therapists in understanding more about normal ankle function.\r"

Results were analyzed for the group as a whole and by diagnostic categories. Experimental Group subjects received a higher percentage of consecutive treatments than the Comparison Group subjects (72% vs 42%). No difference was found between the groups for mean number of physical therapy treatments received per patient. The LOS was neither significantly different between the two groups as a whole nor for 9 of the 11 diagnostic categories. The results imply that providing consecutive physical therapy treatments through seven-day coverage without increasing the number of physical therapy treatments will not reduce the LOS for patients with acute orthopedic disorders.\r"

This gap was reflected in mortality rates which were several-fold higher for Indians, or reflected in time; there were decades between the dates when the U.S. population achieved certain lower death rates compared with the dates when similar reductions were achieved by Indians. As a result of preventive health programs, improvements in sanitation, and the development of a number of medical advances, substantial progress has been achieved in improving the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Life expectancy of Indians has increased 20 years between 1940 and 1980. From 1955 through 1982, the death rate for Indian infants dropped by 82 percent. Also, the age-adjusted death rate for tuberculosis decreased from 57.9 per 100,000 population in 1955 to 3.3 in 1983. These and other improvements are summarized in this paper.\r"

To improve health to an extent that parallels the IHS's past achievements, the illnesses that now are prevelant among Indians require changes in personal and community behavior rather than intensified medical services. Analysis of these conditions leads to the conclusion that much of the existing burden of illness can be reduced or eliminated. IHS is responding to this challenge by continuing to ensure Indians' access to comprehensive health care services, by increasing educational efforts aimed at prevention, and by enlisting the support of other government and private organizations in activities that have as their purpose treating diseases if intervention will lessen morbidity and mortality (such as diabetes and hypertension) and encouraging of dietary changes, cessation of smoking, exercise, reduction in alcohol consumption, and other healthy behavior.\r"

In 1981, a priority-setting exercise established for the first time a grassroots expression of the concerns of the clinic's staff. A three-step process was used in which each staff member first compiled an open-ended list of health needs, then ranked the relative contribution of five factors to making these problems important, and assessed each problem listed by those factors. The factors used were mortality, morbidity, vulnerability to intervention, facilities on hand, and social implications. The resulting priority table represented each person's assessment of the health needs of the community. A composite table was created to represent the group's assessment. The staff concluded that among the many problems listed, alcoholism and diabetes were the most compelling health problems. The priority score was almost identical for each, but the reasons were different. Alcoholism was rated highly because it was felt to be widespread and had serious social implications. Diabetes was ranked highly because it was felt to be lethal and vulnerable to intervention. A significant long-term benefit to the clinic of the 3-month process was to stimulate consultation within the local clinic and to unify the health team, endowing the members with a common sense of purpose.\r"

The program was initiated with support from the Office of Economic Opportunity. Between August 1, 1971, and December 31, 1983, 52 American Indians received public health degrees from the University of Oklahoma's College of Public Health. Of that number, 50 received masters degrees in public health; 1 a PhD; and 1 a DrPH degree. Degrees were granted in these disciplines: biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health, health administration, health education, and human ecology. This study assesses the job achievements of 51 of those American Indian graduates. Each Indian was paired with a non-Indian graduate randomly selected from a cluster sample compiled from the school's files of non-Indian graduates. The results of this study showed that Indian graduates had the kinds and amounts of responsibilities, with the exception of budget approval responsibility, that one would acquire or expect to acquire in a key administrative or staff position. The study further indicated that Indian graduates were generally achieving as much success and satisfaction in their jobs as the non-Indian graduates.\r"

Adolescent pregnancy, with its frequently adverse consequences for the health and well-being of both mother and child, has reached unprecedented levels in the United States, and AIDS now threatens society in its entirety. Despite awareness that effective sex education is essential to combatting these problems, current debates, focused on the content and timing of sex education provided in the schools, are shortsighted. As currently practiced in this country, sex education curriculums convey the wrong message and are targeted to the wrong audience. In emphasizing the provision of data to youth, we ignore the fact that parental guidance and direction are more often helpful than data and options. Yet we fail to provide parents and others who comprise the traditional systems of child care and nurturance with the information they require to assume responsibility for the safe and healthy development of children and youth. Understanding the reasons for the failure of conventional sex education provides a foundation for developing a more effective approach to preventing adolescent pregnancy. Defining an effective message and targeting information to the appropriate audience are necessary to effect a significant reduction in premature sexual behavior among adolescents.\r"

Since reporting began in 1981, these cities have reported 38 percent of all AIDS cases in the United States. Death certificates were selected and matched to the AIDS surveillance registries in each city, and medical records of those not on the AIDS registry were reviewed to determine if AIDS had been diagnosed. The estimated completeness of AIDS case reporting to AIDS surveillance systems was high in all four cities (ranging from 83 percent to 100 percent). The unreported cases were similar to reported cases with respect to sex, race, risk factor, and specific diagnosis. Of the causes of death examined, AIDS, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and Kaposi's sarcoma were predictive of AIDS as defined by the CDC case definition. However, 77 of 588 deaths (13 percent) attributed to 1 of these 3 causes occurred in cases that were presumptively AIDS but did not meet the diagnostic requirements to be classified as AIDS for reporting purposes. A review of death certificates provides an easy and rapid means of evaluating surveillance efforts and can be a useful adjunct to other methods of surveillance for AIDS.\r"

None reported exposure to additional risk factors, such as homosexual or bisexual activity or having received a blood transfusion. Of the patients tested, none was positive for HIV antibodies. The high degree of patient interest in screening was unanticipated as was the lack of positive laboratory findings for HIV antibodies. Factors associated with acceptance of testing included patient awareness of high seroprevalence rates, indifference to potential negative social consequences of positive HIV-antibody status, and the voluntary nature of the testing. These findings raise a cautious sense of optimism about HIV-antibody screening for similar risk groups.\r"

They had been admitted to a 30-day inpatient drug treatment program over a 19-month period (September 1983 through March 1985). The variables examined were divided into three categories: demographic (age, race, education), personality (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory [MMPI] scores and MMPI deviant scores), and drug use patterns (drug of choice, use of single or multiple [mixed] drugs, severity of drug use, and place of use). Three variables were identified that discriminated needle-sharers from other drug abusers. Compared with other drug abusers, needle-sharers used more multiple drugs, were more likely to use a \"shooting gallery,\" and had more problems related to drug use. No demographic or personality variables discriminated needle-sharers from nonsharers. The data suggested that needle-sharing is widespread in the drug culture. Needle-sharing was not confined to a particular racial group, educational level, or personality type. These findings can be used to structure education programs about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for drug abusers. Drug treatment programs appear to provide an important opportunity to educate drug abusers about AIDS and related health issues associated with needle-sharing.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to determine how the sales of various segments of the high fiber and nonhigh fiber, ready-to-eat (RTE) cereal market were influenced by a health message advertising campaign about the possible benefits of a high fiber, low fat diet for preventing some types of cancer. The fiber statements in the media campaign were endorsed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The campaign was undertaken by the Kellogg Company to promote its line of high fiber cereal products, including Kellogg's All-Bran. The data base consisted of computerized purchase data from 209 Giant Food, Inc., supermarkets in the Baltimore, MD, and Washington, DC, metropolitan areas. All the RTE cereal products in the stores were classified according to their fiber content and competitive market positions compared with Kellogg high fiber cereals. Estimates of market share for the various classes of RTE cereal products were obtained weekly for each store during a period of 64 weeks, beginning 16 weeks before the start of the campaign. Shifts in market share between high fiber and nonhigh fiber cereal classifications indicate substantial increases in consumer purchases of Kellogg high fiber cereals, particularly All-Bran, beginning with the start of the Kellogg advertising campaign. Growth in market share of high fiber cereals continued during the entire 48-week evaluation period, with much of the later growth in non-Kellogg high fiber cereals. Growth in sales of high fiber cereals was mainly at the expense of low fiber cereals such as granola-type products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The infant mortality rate for 1982 in Jersey City, a medium-sized urban community, was found to have increased sharply from that for 1981. An investigation by health officials revealed that the increase occurred only among infants delivered to Jersey City residents at a large local municipal hospital. An increase in the incidence of newborns with birth weights of 501-1,000 grams (g) and a decrease in their survival rate accounted for much of the increase. Although local increases in infant mortality are reported in the lay press, the articles usually lack any meaningful analyses. Furthermore, investigations of such increases have not been described in the medical literature. This report describes the investigation of the rise in infant mortality for Jersey City, demonstrates how local officials can approach the problem, and indicates how essential the availability of linked birth and infant death records are to the effort.\r"

Low birth weight infants and normal birth weight infants were contrasted with respect to ambient levels of CO during the 3 months prior to delivery in the neighborhoods where their mothers lived at birth. After adjustment for the confounding effects of maternal race and education, there was no association between higher CO exposure and higher odds of low birth weight. These data do not support a strong association between maternal exposure to neighborhood CO during pregnancy and odds of delivering a low birth weight infant. Further investigation of the effects of CO exposure on birth weight, with direct measurement of total CO exposure, is needed.\r"

The Community Fluoridation Compliance Index was developed to provide retrospective and prospective information on water systems in complying with local and State standards. This index permits flexibility in the amounts of optimal fluoride concentration and the frequency of fluoride sample testing. In addition, the index can be modified to address the size of the population served by the water system. The index's components are reviewed, and its use is demonstrated on 50 water systems from Illinois and 50 from Ohio. Annual data from these two States show how this information can be used for targeting corrective action so that the population receives the greatest benefit from fluoridation. These findings suggest that the Community Fluoridation Compliance Index can be a useful administrative instrument for comparing relative compliance results. Further studies to determine its acceptance at the State and local levels are warranted.\r"

The study was conducted for Planned Parenthood of Louisiana, a recently organized affiliate that began offering clinical services in May 1984, to provide information on the four Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion. Data from telephone interviews among a random sample of 1,000 women 15-35 years old in New Orleans before the clinic opened confirmed that the need for family planning services was not entirely satisfied by existing service providers. Moreover, it indicated that clinic hours and the cost of services were in line with client interests. The most useful findings for developing the promotional strategy were the relatively low name recognition of Planned Parenthood and a higher-than-expected level of interest that young, low income blacks expressed in using the service.\r"

  ".W": "An epidemic of abuse with \"T's and blues\" began in the late 1970's in which pentazocine-Talwin tablets (\"T\")--and the antihistamine tripelennamine (known as blues) were crushed, dissolved together, filtered, and injected intravenously. The resulting high was reported to be similar to that of heroin. In 1981, the manufacturer and the Food and Drug Administration met to discuss a possible solution. As a result, 0.5 mg of naloxone hydrochloride, a narcotic antagonist that is pharmacologically inactive at that dose orally but active if administered parenterally, was added to the tablet formulation. The reformulated product, Talwin Nx, was approved for marketing in late 1982 and introduced in the second quarter of 1983. Distribution of Talwin tablets in the United States was discontinued. The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) of the National Institute of Drug Abuse and IMS America's National Prescription Audit were used to review the use and abuse patterns of pentazocine before and after the naloxone intervention. The number of prescriptions dispensed quarterly for pentazocine products remained fairly stable from 1981 through the first quarter of 1983 and increased after the introduction of Talwin Nx. In contrast, DAWN emergency room and medical examiner mentions decreased after the product reformulation. The rates of both emergency room and medical examiner mentions per million prescriptions were substantially lower in the 2 years following the introduction of Talwin Nx (decreases of 70 percent by emergency rooms and 71 percent by medical examiners), indicating that the product reformulation successfully reduced pentazocine abuse.\r"

Eighteen surveys collecting smoking data were identified. The key persons associated with the surveys were interviewed according to a uniform protocol developed to obtain comparable data on the content, timeframe, population sample, methodology, availability of data, and mode of information dissemination of the surveys. Analysis indicated that the main variations among surveys occurred in the age range of the population sampled, the definition of smoking behavior, and the quantification of cigarettes smoked. Other issues of special interest compared in the surveys included type of cigarette smoked, attempts at smoking cessation, smokeless tobacco use, passive smoking, use of low tar and low nicotine cigarettes, and smoking among special populations (women, youth, Hispanics, and blacks). Two main areas of concern in planning, targeting, and evaluating timely and appropriate smoking behavior interventions are the lag between data collection and publication of survey results and the variability in the content and methodology of the surveys.\r"

The illness behavior of three cohorts of workers at three levels of risk--workers removed from the chemical plant to a pallet plant (PP) because their screening results indicated liver abnormalities; workers who had some positive test results (TP); and workers whose test results were negative (TN)--was studied before (time 1) and after (time 2) the angiosarcoma crisis. It was predicted that, during time 2, the groups' visits to the dispensary would increase in relation to their levels of risk (PP greater than TP greater than TN). Although there was an overall increase in the percentage of visits because of vague symptoms during time 2, the only cohort with different behavior was the group of TP workers: they reduced their use of the dispensary. These results are similar to those in a previous study in which all symptoms of illness were included. It is speculated that social and individual factors, as well as the labeling phenomenon, explain the results. Health care providers are encouraged to follow up with workers at risk who seem to avoid monitoring their health.\r"

Sites of care were conventional care in hospitals, hospital-based hospice care, and hospice care in the home. Subjects were terminal cancer patients with a prognosis of less than 6 months of life who were attended by a primary concerned person. There were 1,732 patients 18-99 years old-293 conventional care, 612 hospital-based hospice care, and 827 hospice home care patients. Data sources were the patient, the primary concerned person, the family, and the medical record. Data were obtained at initial interview for the study, 1-week followup, reassessment every 2 weeks, and bereavement interviews. Information was grouped in the following categories: patient functional status, patient psychological outlook, symptomatology, medical condition, and characteristics of the primary concerned person and family. Conclusions were reached by univariate and multivariate analysis. First, a progression of functional disability was found to exist among care sites, from hospice home care for the least disabled to hospital-based hospice care to conventional care for patients with the greatest disabilities. The location of care was best explained by the patient's functional capacity. Second, the location of care was found to be poorly explained by extent of organ involvement or specific symptoms. Third, the primary concerned persons of patients under hospice home care experienced more stress but reacted no differently when compared with primary concerned persons at other care sites. Fourth, patients under hospice home care survived the longest and reported greater family closeness than other care groups.\r"

Fifteen patients had significantly poorer survival after palliative irradiation for overt metastatic disease or severe debility. The pathologic specimens from four of the nine patients who underwent resection showed no histologic evidence of residual tumor; however, tumor recurred in three in the mediastinum, and only one remains alive and free of disease. Four of the 11 patients who received chemotherapy and radiation therapy without resection remain alive and free of disease after further mediastinal irradiation, suggesting a benefit from additional regional therapy. Chemotherapy improved median survival duration and complete response rate but did not produce a significant improvement in survival, as reported in other recent series.\r"

The results were then analyzed with respect to lesion size, cutaneous versus nodal lesions, and site of cutaneous lesion (trunk, head and neck, or extremity). Correlation between fraction size and response rate was independent of lesion size, although there were fewer complete responses with increasing lesion size. Correlation was not seen in nodal lesions but was particularly striking in cutaneous lesions. This correlation was statistically significant only for cutaneous lesions of the extremities.\r"

All areas of the protein presumed to be critical for channel function show high evolutionary conservation. These include those proposed to function in voltage-sensitive gating, inactivation, and ion selectivity. All 24 putative gating charges of the vertebrate protein are in identical positions in the Drosophila gene. Ten introns interrupt the coding regions of the four homology units; introns with positions conserved among homology units bracket a region hypothesized to be the selectivity filter for the channel. The Drosophila gene maps to the right arm of the second chromosome in region 60D-E. This position does not coincide with any known mutations that confer behavioral phenotypes, but is close to the seizure locus (60A-B), which has been hypothesized to code for a voltage-sensitive sodium channel.\r"

To facilitate biochemical studies of a K+ channel, genomic DNA from the Shaker locus has been cloned. Rearrangements in five Shaker mutants have been mapped to a 60-kilobase segment of the genome. Four complementary DNA clones have been analyzed. These clones indicate that the Shaker gene contains multiple exons distributed over at least 65 kilobases of genomic DNA in the region where the mutations mapped. Furthermore, the gene may produce several classes of alternatively spliced transcripts. Two of the complementary DNA clones have been sequenced and their sequences support the hypothesis that Shaker encodes a component of a K+ channel.\r"

Mosquitoes injected with this plasmid were screened for resistance to the neomycin analog G-418. A single event of plasmid insertion was recovered. Integration appears to be stable and, thus far, resistance to G-418 has been expressed for eight generations. The transformation event appears to be independent of P.\r"

The ability to assay the biological activity of this ATPase in a transfection protocol permits the application of molecular genetic techniques to the analysis of structure-function relationships for the enzyme that establishes the internal Na+/K+ environment of most animal cells. The full-length alpha 1 subunit complementary DNA will also be useful as a dominant selectable marker for somatic cell genetic studies utilizing ouabain-sensitive cells.\r"

The active site structure of the Asn102 mutant of trypsin is identical to the native enzyme with respect to the specificity pocket, the oxyanion hole, and the orientation of the nucleophilic serine. The observed decrease in rate results from the loss of nucleophilicity of the active site serine. This decreased nucleophilicity may result from stabilization of a His57 tautomer that is unable to accept the serine hydroxyl proton.\r"

It represses transcription of a group of cell type-specific genes by binding to an operator located upstream of each target gene. Fifteen in-frame deletions within the coding region of the MAT alpha 2 gene were constructed. The deletion alleles were examined for phenotypes conferred in vivo, and the encoded mutant proteins were assayed for ability to bind specifically to the operator in vitro. This analysis has revealed that the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of alpha 2 is located within a region of 68 amino acids. This region of alpha 2 has significant homology with the homeo domain, a conserved sequence found in the products of several Drosophila homeotic and segmentation genes. In addition, there is a class of mutant alpha 2 proteins that binds tightly and specifically to the operator in vitro, but fails to repress transcription in vivo.\r"

Analysis of both genomic and complementary DNA clones encoding the human gamma polypeptide shows differences in lengths of the coding portions of the two constant region genes, C gamma 1 and C gamma 2. A single second-exon segment is always present in the C gamma 1 gene. C gamma 2 alleles containing either duplicated or triplicated second-exon segments are present in the normal human population and are expressed as messenger RNAs. Furthermore, a cysteine residue, encoded by the second exon of C gamma 1 and probably involved in interchain disulfide bridging, is absent in all C gamma 2 second-exon segments. These differences between C gamma 1 and the two alleles of C gamma 2 may explain the variability in molecular weight and disulfide bonding of gamma molecules expressed in different cells.\r"

The pH values in the vaginal fornices were significantly lower than those in the middle portion of the vagina. Sexually active women had significantly lower pH values than sexually inactive women. The transvaginal electropotential difference and estimated blood flow values were lower than those of premenopausal women reported in the literature, indicating impaired vaginal transport mechanism and decreased vaginal blood flow.

The first study was performed from January 1983 to March 1984 and consisted of 71 patients treated with collagenase injection (600 ABC units) and 93 patients treated with chymopapain injection (4,000 units) into lower lumbar discs. The second study was started in May 1985 and ended December 1985. The results of 41 patients injected with chymopapain and 45 patients injected with collagenase (400 ABC units) are reported. The overall success rate after 3 months was 69%/63% for chymopapain/high-dose collagenase and 73%/71% for chymopapain/low-dose collagenase and 75%/72% after 6 months for chymopapain/high-dose collagenase. Eighteen percent of the chymopapain-treated patients and 21% of the collagenase-treated patients of the first study had to be operated on within 6 months and 12% of chymopapain patients and 29% of collagenase patients within 3 months in the second study. Six of the 134 patients who had chymopapain treatment had slight allergic reactions. Patients who had collagenase treatment had no allergic reactions under the same regimen of systemic prophylactic measures. Patients who had high-dose collagenase injections suffered significantly more from postinjectional pseudoradicular and low-back pain in the first 3 months. In the first study, no permanent neurologic complications occurred. Two patients in the low-dose collagenase group developed cauda equina syndromes in the 2 weeks after injection because of large extruded disc fragments.\r"

  ".W": "The inflammatory response may play a critical role in determining the ultimate fate of the allograft. Certain inflammatory mediators derived from the arachidonic acid lipoxygenase pathway (e.g., leukotriene B4), stimulate T cell function in vitro, but their role in allograft rejection is unknown. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) inhibits both the lipoxygenase (LO) pathway and T cell function in vitro. In this study, we investigated the effects of systemic LO inhibition with NDGA on the in vivo generation of allospecific and natural killer (NK) effector cells and arachidonic acid metabolites from sponge matrix allografts in mice. In control animals, generation of both allospecific cytolytic and NK cells increased progressively up to 12 days after grafting. Sponge cell synthesis of both leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and the cyclooxygenase product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) could also be detected over this period. Recipient NDGA treatment (50 mg/kg/day) impaired both the accumulation and the specific cytotoxic potential of lymphocytes in allograft. Compared with control animals (1196 +/- 30 pg/10(6) cells), cells from recipients of NDGA produced significantly less LTB4 (55 +/- 10 pg/10(6) cells, p less than 0.01) but produced normal amounts of PGE2 (340 +/- /255 +/- 22 pg/10(6) cells, p = NS), thus proving the specificity of the NDGA treatment on LO pathway function. We conclude that cells capable of metabolizing arachidonic acid by both pathways accumulate in sponge allografts, but LO activity is specifically suppressed by systemic NDGA. Furthermore, systemic LO inhibition reduces the nonspecific inflammatory component, as well as allospecific cytolytic and NK generation, without compromising animal survival. These studies suggest that suppression of specific components of the inflammatory response associated with allograft rejection by LO inhibition may be a useful approach to selective immunosuppression.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial and pulmonary preservation can be prolonged in the autoperfused working heart-lung (AWHL) preparation by metabolic substrate enhancement. However, uncontrolled pulmonary hypertension following denervation may result in extensive lung injury and occasional early failure of the preparation. To determine whether cardiopulmonary preservation could be reliably extended without development of pulmonary hypertension, six heart-lung blocks were harvested from calves, placed in a normothermic AWHL circuit, and studied. Continuous infusions of isoproterenol and dextrose/insulin were administered for the duration of the preparation. Thirteen heart-lung preparations received neither isoproterenol nor metabolic substrate and served as controls. Myocardial function was assessed by sonomicrometric techniques and pulmonary preservation was evaluated by extravascular lung water, arterial oxygenation on 100% inspired oxygen, static lung compliance, and pulmonary vascular resistance. Pulmonary hypertension developed in the control group and these animals did not survive beyond 7.5 hours. The addition of isoproterenol and metabolic substrate increased organ survival from 4.8 +/- 0.4 to 18.0 +/- 1.4 hours (p = 0.0001) and significantly reduced postexplant pulmonary vasoconstriction (p less than 0.05). Addition of isoproterenol and metabolic substrate to the AWHL model prolonged support of cardiorespiratory function and provided a reliable method for distant procurement in heart-lung transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Although prostaglandin E1 is used to dilate the constricted ductus arteriosus in infants with cyanotic heart disease, the mechanism is unknown. To test the hypothesis that the cyclic nucleotides adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) play a role in relaxation, isolated rings of the ductus arteriosus of fetal lambs were studied. Tension of isometric contraction was measured by force displacement transducers. After contraction with oxygen, a control group was compared with rings in which the stimulus for relaxation was either nitrogen gas, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), nitroglycerin (NTG), or nitroprusside (NPS). During relaxation, tissue was frozen at 30 seconds and at 1, 2, and 5 minutes and analyzed for cAMP and cGMP. PGE1 (10(-6) mol/L) decreased tension by 33% compared with 70% for nitrogen gas, 81% for NTG (10(-5) mol/L), and 92% for NPS (10(-5) mol/L). The maximal relaxation induced by PGE1 was associated with an 11-fold increase in cAMP; PGE1 had no significant effect on cGMP tissue levels. Nitrogen gas, NTG, and NPS produced similar increases in cAMP, and eight-, 25-, and nine-fold increases in cGMP, respectively. These results suggest that the patency of the ductus arteriosus is dependent on activation of both guanylate cyclase and adenylate cyclase and that the nitrovasodilators may be clinically useful in maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus.\r"
