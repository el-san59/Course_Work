  ".W": "To define the role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the pathogenesis of oral hairy leukoplakia, 13 human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive men with clinical and histologic evidence of oral hairy leukoplakia were enrolled in an open-label trial of orally administered acyclovir therapy (3.2 g/d for 20 days). Of six patients who received therapy, five exhibited clinical regression. Once therapy was discontinued, recurrences occurred in all responders. Among seven patients who refused therapy, no spontaneous remissions occurred. Before therapy, EBV replication within the leukoplakia was demonstrated by immunofluorescence tissue staining or electron microscopy in five patients who were studied. Human papillomavirus was not detected by immunocytochemistry or electron microscopy from tissue specimens of six patients. After therapy, biopsy specimens from two patients with complete responses revealed a normalization of histologic abnormalities and an inability to detect EBV in previously involved mucosa by immunofluorescence or in situ DNA hybridization assays. It was concluded that EBV replication within the epithelial cells of the tongue is necessary for the development of oral hairy leukoplakia.\r"

  ".W": "Nitroglycerin and the long-acting nitrates are beneficial in stable and unstable angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction and as adjunctive therapy in congestive heart failure. Nitroglycerin compounds relax vascular smooth muscle, producing venous, arterial, and arteriolar dilatation. These actions are modulated by stimulation of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Nitrate efficacy in ischemic heart disease is due to peripheral venous and arterial vasodilatation that results in decreased myocardial oxygen consumption. Nitrates also dilate coronary arteries and collaterals, reverse coronary vasoconstriction, and enlarge some coronary atherosclerotic lesions. Nitrates improve exercise performance in stable angina pectoris. Intravenous nitroglycerin should be used in the initial treatment of unstable angina. Nitrates may be beneficial in myocardial infarction for control of ischemic pain, acute hypertension, and left ventricular failure. In subjects with congestive heart failure, nitrates reduce symptoms and improve exercise tolerance. Nitrate tolerance is a problem with continuous nitrate therapy. Tolerance is most likely to occur with frequent dosing or the use of long-acting nitrates, particularly transdermal nitroglycerin disks, and can be prevented or reversed with intermittent-dosing regimens.\r"

In a cross-sectional survey of 167 hospitalized children, 112 (67%) had malaria, 78 (47%) had received transfusions during the current hospitalization, and 21 (13%) were HIV seropositive. Ten of the 11 seropositive malaria patients had received transfusions during the current hospitalization; pretransfusion specimens were available for four of these children and were seronegative. Of all blood transfusions, 87% were administered to malaria patients, and there was a strong dose-response association between transfusions and HIV seropositivity. A review of 1000 emergency ward records demonstrated that 69% of transfusions were administered to malaria patients, and 97% of children who received transfusions had pretransfusion hematocrits of 0.25 or less (less than or equal to 25%). The treatment of malaria with blood transfusions is an important factor in the exposure of Kinshasa children to HIV infection.\r"

The most common NTDs are anencephaly and meningomyelocele, which arise during the process of neurulation, a well-defined period between the 17th and 30th day after ovulation. These NTDs are clinically apparent by being open, ie, leaving nervous tissue exposed, in contrast to postneurulation NTDs that are skin covered. The incidence of NTDs is declining in several areas of the world, including the United States. While the reasons for this are unclear, there seems to be some effect from prenatal diagnosis, genetic counseling, and possibly nutritional supplementation.\r"

In this study the insulin tolerance test was used to assess hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal reserve five to seven days after pituitary surgery, and postoperative morning serum cortisol concentration was compared with the insulin tolerance test for predicting corticotropin deficiency. In 35 patients with pituitary tumors studied prospectively, 27 had normal insulin tolerance test results five to seven days after pituitary surgery; in these patients, the morning serum cortisol concentration two to three days after surgery was 250 nmol/L (9 micrograms/dL) or greater. Eight patients had subnormal insulin tolerance test results or clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency; the morning serum cortisol concentration in these patients was 80 nmol/L (3 micrograms/dL) or less. Postoperative adrenal insufficiency was transient (one to three months) in five of these eight patients. We retrospectively identified 45 patients whose postoperative morning serum cortisol values were 200 nmol/L (7 micrograms/dL) or greater; none of these patients had clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency. We conclude that a morning serum cortisol level obtained two to three days after surgery and 24 hours after the discontinuation of hydrocortisone accurately predicts postoperative corticotropin reserve.\r"

Primary end-to-end anastomosis of the infrarenal aorta was performed with absorbable Maxon suture or nonabsorbable Prolene suture in 20 piglets. Ten of the Maxon suture group and nine of the Prolene suture group survived; one pig died of infection. The animals were put to death 6 months after the operation. Each abdominal aorta was removed and a roentgenogram was obtained. The aorta was then burst-tested to 300 mm Hg, measured, and examined both grossly and histologically. All anastomoses were patent and no burst failures were observed in either group. However, Prolene sutures protruded into lumen and were partially embedded in the aortic wall in all animals in the Prolene suture group. Thrombus adhered to the intraluminal Prolene suture in six of nine animals. The growth of the anastomotic area was wider in the Maxon suture group (446.4% +/- 131.8% versus 317.6% +/- 121.5%, p less than 0.05). Stenosis was more common in the Prolene suture group (7/9) than in the Maxon suture group (1/10) (p less than 0.01), but the distal segment was widely patent in both groups. Dilatation at the anastomotic site was present in eight of 10 pigs in the Maxon suture group and in two of nine in the Prolene suture group. Histologic study showed that the area of tissue reaction was more prominent in the Prolene suture group. No sutures were observed in the Maxon suture group. We therefore recommend the use of absorbable Maxon sutures for anastomoses in which the suture line must be able to grow.\r"

The presence in the serum of recipients of preformed antibodies, cytotoxic to donors lymphocytes, is associated with a high probability of hyperacute rejection. We identified 11 patients in whom, despite a compatible direct lymphocytotoxic cross-match, acute failure of the cardiac homograft was associated with histologic and immunologic findings consistent with hyperacute rejection. Direct immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining showed the presence of antibodies on the surface of vascular endothelial cells in each of these 11 patients. The serum of these recipients was found to contain antibodies against a panel of endothelial cells. In contrast, cytotoxic antibodies to vascular endothelial cells were not present in a control group of 18 heart transplant recipients who did not experience hyperacute rejection. Thus the presence of antibodies against vascular endothelial cells seems to be related to hyperacute rejection of the cardiac allograft.\r"

In five mongrel dogs, the heart and lungs were separated and removed with the liver, pancreas, kidneys, and a small portion of intestine en bloc while they were being self-perfused. A respirator was used for oxygenation. Arterial and venous blood pressures were measured by indwelling catheters. Fresh blood, glucose, electrolytes, mannitol, prednisolone, and a fat emulsion (Soyacal) were infused through the portal vein. The organs were experimentally perfused for 12 hours. Aortic systolic pressure ranged from 75 to 125 mm Hg, central venous pressure from 0 to 5 mm Hg, portal venous pressure from 0 to 3 mm Hg, bile output from 5 to 20 ml/hr, urine output from 10 to 70 ml/hr, and hematocrit value from 35% to 55%. The heart and lungs were normal and physiologically functional during the preservation time. The pancreas and small intestine appeared normal. Three of the livers showed some congestion. The kidney in one organ block appeared to have some edematous swelling after 16 hours. The technique for multiorgan preservation presented here is simple and effective. The preliminary data are encouraging and suggest further evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of the donor heart to total circulatory performance after heterotopic heart transplantation has been difficult to assess. First-pass nuclear angiocardiography and directional Doppler echocardiography were used to examine separately left and right ventricular function of the donor heart after heterotopic transplantation. A comparison was made between two patients, one with a low initial pulmonary vascular resistance and one with a high, relatively fixed pulmonary vascular resistance. In both cases, currently available noninvasive techniques allowed confirmation of the expectation that the donor left ventricle can function effectively as a left ventricular bypass. In neither case was recovery of the native heart demonstrated. The contribution of the donor right ventricle to total right ventricular output appeared to be dependent on the condition of the donor heart and on the pulmonary vascular resistance. In situations with a high pulmonary vascular resistance and end-stage right ventricular failure, it was concluded that the donor heart may not at first constitute an effective assist for the native right ventricle. Native right ventricular failure may then become a major factor influencing survival after heterotopic heart transplantation.\r"

Attention to proper focusing and exposure times, the use of diffusion screens to eliminate reflections, and the use of nonobtrusive black backgrounds are recommended. Specimens should be fixed before being photographed, and perfusion-fixation is recommended for cases in which tomographic dissections are performed. Hearts dissected by the inflow-outflow method may require pinning so that specific abnormalities may be demonstrated optimally. Lesions may be highlighted with probes and arrows or by comparison with a normal specimen. Use of composite slides is particularly recommended for visual conceptualization of mechanisms and pathogenesis of disease. These techniques are also applicable for the preparation of teaching slides in areas of pathology other than cardiovascular.\r"

Assessment of the influence of therapeutic interventions in RA is difficult because the natural history of the disease remains poorly defined and unpredictable, and neither the traditional clinical and laboratory measurements of inflammation nor radiographic analyses of progression of joint destruction provide an accurate estimate of the long-term outcome of RA. Furthermore, there is little evidence that second-line agents yield benefits beyond 3 years. Therefore, adequately tested comprehensive measures should be used in large, long-term, multicenter controlled clinical trials to determine whether the long-term outcome of RA can be altered.\r"

  ".W": "An agent with the properties of a retrovirus has been detected regularly in monocytes from patients with breast cancer. In 97% of breast cancer patients the cell-free culture medium (CFCM) in which the monocytes had been cultured possessed reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. In contrast, RT activity was detected in the CFCM from only 11% of age and sex matched controls (p less than 0.0001; Wilcoxon rank sum test). The RT activity was associated with particles having a buoyant density of between 1.165 and 1.18 g/ml, similar to that of retroviruses. Treatment of the samples with non-ionic detergent abolished the peaking of the activity in this fraction. Enveloped particles (100-120 nm in diameter) with a fringed surface resembling murine mammary tumour virus were found on negative-stain electron microscopy in CFCM obtained from patients with breast cancer. Retrovirus-like particles were also observed in the cytoplasm of giant cells formed by monocytes from these patients, and also in macrophages in breast cancer tissue; however, no such particles were detected in the tumour cells. These findings strongly suggest the presence of a retrovirus in the monocytes from patients with breast cancer. The importance of these observations in the pathophysiology of carcinoma of the breast remains to be established.\r"

To show a 20% reduction (to 4%) in mortality with an alpha error (two-sided) of 0.05 and a beta error of 0.2 requires 15,000 patients. By contrast, a 25% improvement towards normal in ejection fraction (from about 59% to about 62%) requires only 384 patients. Since it is likely that one of several thrombolytic agents will be effective in conjunction with one or more myocardial protective agents, many trials will be required, and it may be more appropriate in future studies to measure left ventricular function rather than mortality as the principal end-point.\r"

The sustained dose-dependent rise in haematocrit which it produces effectively abolishes symptoms of anaemia, but at the cost of an increase in blood viscosity. This in turn predisposes to increased vascular resistance and the development of hypertension. Over half of all deaths of patients with end-stage renal failure are from cardiovascular disease, notably myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke, for which hypertension is a known risk factor. Erythropoietin-related increases in blood pressure are therefore of particular concern, and seem to be most severe in previously hypertensive patients. There is now a need to establish the optimum rate and extent of rise of haematocrit required to alleviate symptoms without incurring undue risk.\r"

Histologic and clinical similarities between this neuroendocrine neoplasm and other organoid laryngeal tumors have led to uncertainty regarding the malignant potential and prognosis of this entity. Immunohistochemical assays have identified biogenic amines and hormonal peptides in these tumors which may prove useful as diagnostic markers. Computer tomography (CT) scanning demonstrates an enhancing lesion and can determine the location and extent of the tumor. The generally small size and constant blood supply of the laryngeal paraganglioma make preoperative angiography unnecessary. Accordingly, intraoperative ligation of the arterial blood supply negates the need for embolization. Partial laryngectomy remains the mainstay of treatment. A case is reported of a patient with a paraganglioma of the larynx who was unsuccessfully treated by laser excision and required surgical resection.\r"

The diagnosis and classification of this disorder has been problematic, owing to the lack of uniform diagnostic criteria and the difficulty in obtaining pathologic material for diagnosis. This study proposes to establish diagnostic criteria for PACNS which would include 1) the presence of an unexplained neurologic deficit after thorough clinical and laboratory evaluation; 2) documentation by cerebral angiography and/or tissue examination of an arteritic process within the central nervous system; and 3) no evidence of a systemic vasculitide or any other condition to which the angiographic or pathologic features could be secondary. Utilizing these criteria, 8 new cases are reported and are combined with 40 previously diagnosed cases from the literature. The clinical findings of the combined series revealed that headache was the most common symptom (58%) with a combination of focal and diffuse neurologic deficits described in 79% of the group. The diagnostic approach to PACNS should include a variety of laboratory tests and examination of the cerebral spinal fluid primarily to rule out mimicking conditions. Special procedures including electroencephalography, computed axial tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging appear only marginally helpful in securing the diagnosis, but are extremely important in ruling out other conditions. Angiography appears to be the first invasive diagnostic procedure of choice and it has a high predictive value when properly interpreted. Leptomeningeal and cortical biopsy can be accomplished with acceptable mortality and should be performed along with a normal or non-diagnostic angiogram when the diagnostic likelihood is high. Therapy of PACNS with a combination of cytotoxic drugs and high-dose corticosteroids has greatly improved the prognosis for this condition.\r"

  ".W": "Patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation who are seropositive for cytomegalovirus are vulnerable to serious cytomegalovirus infection, presumably because of reactivation of latent endogenous virus and severe immunosuppression. We administered intravenous acyclovir from 5 days before to 30 days after allogeneic marrow transplantation for hematologic neoplasms in an effort to prevent cytomegalovirus infection and disease in patients seropositive for cytomegalovirus before transplantation. Eighty-six patients seropositive for both cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus before transplantation received acyclovir, whereas 65 patients seropositive only for cytomegalovirus served as controls (acyclovir is the standard prophylactic agent against herpes simplex virus in this setting). The probability that cytomegalovirus infection would develop within the first 100 days after transplantation was 0.70 among acyclovir recipients and 0.87 among control patients at medians of 62 and 40 days after transplantation, respectively (P = 0.0001 by log-rank test). Invasive cytomegalovirus disease developed in 19 acyclovir recipients (22 percent) and 25 control patients (38 percent) (P = 0.008). Survival within the first 100 days after transplantation was better among acyclovir recipients (P = 0.002). Acyclovir prophylaxis was associated with a relative risk of 0.5 or less for the development of cytomegalovirus infection or disease or for death within the first 100 days after transplantation (P less than or equal to 0.04), in proportional-hazards regression analysis. We conclude that prophylaxis with intravenous acyclovir significantly reduced the risk of both cytomegalovirus infection and cytomegalovirus disease in seropositive patients after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and that it was also associated with significantly improved survival.\r"

To determine whether treatment with a calcium-channel blocker would improve survival and neurologic outcome in acute ischemic stroke, we enrolled 186 patients in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of nimodipine (30 mg every six hours), begun within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of an acute ischemic stroke. During the four-week treatment period, mortality from all causes was significantly reduced with nimodipine as compared with placebo (8 deaths [8.6 percent] vs. 19 [20.4 percent]). The improvement in survival was restricted to men. During the follow-up period of six months, an additional eight patients in each group died. A significantly better neurologic outcome, as assessed by the Mathew scale of neurologic deficit, was also observed in the nimodipine group. The improvement in neurologic status was greatest in patients with a moderate to severe deficit at base line. There were no important side effects except for one episode of reversible azotemia that may have been related to treatment with nimodipine. Our data suggest that patients with acute ischemic stroke may benefit from early treatment with nimodipine, but this therapeutic effect appears to be limited to men.\r"

Sixteen similar patients in whom pancreas transplantation had been unsuccessful (mean total hemoglobin A1, 12.0 percent; range, 8.0 to 18.0) served as a control group. The majority of patients in both groups had advanced proliferative retinopathy. At a mean follow-up of 24 months we found no significant difference between the groups in the rate of progression of retinopathy, expressed as a score. Success of the transplantation did not prevent progression of retinopathy across the range of retinopathy studied. Progressive retinopathy was observed more commonly in patients with low retinopathy scores (nonproliferative or mild proliferative retinopathy) at base line in both the study group (13 of 17 eyes, or 76 percent) and the control group (7 of 12 eyes, or 58 percent). Further analysis suggested the possibility that after three years of euglycemia, the study group had less deterioration than the control group, particularly in eyes with advanced retinopathy. We observed no difference in the rate of loss of vision between the two groups. This study provides evidence that pancreas transplantation and subsequent normoglycemia neither reverse nor prevent the progression of diabetic retinopathy.\r"

  ".U": "88094596\r", 
  ".W": "The Medicare end-stage renal disease program has received considerable attention as a model of government funding for high-cost medical treatment. This paper examines how the program has been influenced by renal transplantation. In the past decade, the number of kidney transplantations has increased substantially, and the success rate of these procedures has improved. From 1980 to 1985, the number of transplantations increased by 10 percent per year. During that time, the survival rates for grafts from cadavers and living related donors increased by 7 and 3 percent, respectively, in part because of the introduction of cyclosporine. As a result, the fastest-growing group of beneficiaries of the Medicare end-stage renal disease program are those with functioning grafts. As of the end of 1985, these patients accounted for 18 percent of all beneficiaries and 32 percent of all beneficiaries less than 55 years of age. In the youngest groups, transplantation has reached a level sufficient to reduce the absolute numbers of patients on dialysis, beginning in 1983. Increases in transplantation are not evenly distributed among subgroups of beneficiaries. Relatively few patients 65 years of age and older receive transplants; blacks receive transplants at a rate roughly half that among whites, but the rate is increasing. Because the costs of maintaining patients with functioning grafts are only one third of those for patients on dialysis and because the quality of life is usually much better, renal transplantation is causing a convergence of the best clinical and economic outcomes for patients with end-stage renal disease.\r"

  ".W": "Primary infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is persistent and widespread, with symptoms that are mostly subclinical but can cause serious illness or death, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. Recently, proteins from HCMV were shown to bind beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) a protein that is normally found associated with the class-I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, which are essential for self-non-self recognition in the immune response. These findings led to the proposal that the virus may use beta 2-m binding as an infection mechanism. Here we present evidence from DNA sequence analysis that HCMV encodes a molecule similar to the MHC class-I antigens of higher eucaryotes, and propose that this protein is responsible for the observed beta 2-m binding. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the HCMV class-I-like protein reveals conservation of typical features of class-I structure, but we predict that the gene is not spliced, in contrast to the cellular genes.\r"

  ".W": "Based on precedents from other retroviruses, the precursor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase is predicted to be a polyprotein with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 160,000 (160K) encoded by both the viral pol gene and the upstream gag gene. These two genes lie in different translational reading frames, with the 3' end of gag overlapping the 5' end of pol by 205 or 241 nucleotides. Thus, production of the gag-pol fusion protein would require either messenger RNA processing or translational frameshifting. The latter mechanism has been shown in the synthesis of the gag-pol proteins of two other retroviruses, Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV). Here we report that translation of HIV-1 RNA synthesized in vitro by SP6 RNA polymerase yields significant amounts of a gag-pol fusion protein, indicating that efficient ribosomal frameshifting also occurs within the HIV-1 gag-pol overlap region. Site-directed mutagenesis and amino-acid sequencing localized the site of frameshifting to a UUA leucine codon near the 5' end of the overlap.\r"

With probes for about 25% of the proximal portion of the gene, we found the proximal probes detected deletions in 23% of nonselected DMD boys, while a single distal probe detected 17% more as deletions. The combined percentage was 39% for all probes tested. Prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection are more accurate if deletions are mapped rather than by use of restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The effort involved in screening all affected boys for deletions is considerably less, and provides an accurate genetic marker for subsequent prenatal diagnosis in the family and prospective counseling for female relatives. It seems likely that, once the entire gene (cDNA) is available for screening, most DMD boys will show deletions.\r"

Seventy patients were examined and delivered by cesarean section, including 58 at risk because of previous cesarean section and 12 nulliparous controls not at risk. Of the at-risk patients, 12 had confirmed defects, for an incidence of 20.7%. All the controls were normal. The false-positive rate for at-risk patients was 7.1%, and the positive and negative predictive values were 92.3 and 100%, respectively. For the diagnosed cases, the sonographic lower uterine segment seemed to form earlier (P less than .01) and was thinner (P less than .01) than that in the negative cases or the controls. Although our study design was observational and did not allow us to test the performance of the lower uterine segment when a defect was found, we discuss the use of a three-stage classification system to assist in identifying sonographically detected defects in a future trial of labor protocol. We conclude that sonographic surveillance is a reliable and practical means of evaluating the lower uterine segment after conception and before labor or delivery.\r"

The vasodilating, platelet-disaggregating prostaglandins (PGI2 and PGE) are increased during normal pregnancy and may account for many of the observed hemodynamic changes, which begin as early as the first trimester. In contrast, a relative increase in the vasoconstricting, platelet-aggregating prostaglandins (thromboxane A2 and PGF2 alpha) is seen in preeclampsia. The disruption in the delicate balance between these two opposing pairs of prostaglandins may play an important role in the causation of preeclampsia. The growing body of literature that deals with the relationship between prostaglandins and preeclampsia is discussed.\r"

Triglycerides increased with all preparations, with the ethynodiol diacetate group (37.6%) and the biphasic norethindrone group (45.3%) showing the greatest increase. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased 10-15.6% among the groups; low-density lipoprotein-apolipoprotein B changed proportional to the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increases.

Thirty-one drinkers and two control women smoked. Maternal ethanol consumption was accompanied by increased output of prostacyclin and thromboxane metabolites in the mothers, but no relationship was apparent between the increased metabolites and development of fetal alcohol effects in 22 mothers. There were no differences between smoking and nonsmoking drinkers in the excretion of these prostanoids. All the infants born to the drinkers had increased thromboxane B2 excretion, but the excretion of prostacyclin metabolites was increased only in infants with fetal alcohol effects. The ratio between prostacyclin and thromboxane was reduced in infants with fetal alcohol effects. Thus, maternal ethanol consumption is associated with enhanced prostacyclin and thromboxane synthesis, perhaps in the kidneys and/or systemic circulation and vascular bed. Similar changes may also occur in the fetus and/or newborn with fetal alcohol effects.\r"

The overall mortality rate was 14% (five of 35). No immediate transfusion-related deaths occurred; all fetuses who were not hydropic at first transfusion survived (26 of 26). The mean gestational age at delivery was 33.6 weeks (range 25-36). One infant developed respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Transfusion-related complications occurred in five cases (fetal colon infusions in two, fetal retroperitoneal infusion in two, and fetal abdominal wall hematoma in one). None of these infants required urgent delivery or suffered long-term sequelae. In nonhydropic fetuses, intraperitoneal transfusions under direct ultrasound guidance had a low incidence of morbidity and no mortality. These results should provide baseline data against which to compare new techniques, such as direct cord transfusion. With neonatal mortality rates of 10% and significant morbidity rates of 10-20% in infants delivered at 32 weeks who develop RDS, intraperitoneal transfusion should be considered in the 32- to 33-week fetus with marked pulmonary immaturity.\r"

Upon the patient's admission, we obtained cervical cultures for group B streptococcus, genital mycoplasmas, and chlamydia. Patients with and without group B streptococcus were compared. Group B streptococcus patients had earlier rupture of membranes (30.7 versus 31.6 weeks) and shorter latent periods (76.8 versus 138.5 hours). Intra-amniotic infection (six of 16 versus 26 of 120) and endometritis (four of ten versus three of 94) were significantly more common in group B streptococcus patients. Neonates of mothers positive for group B streptococcus were smaller (1749 +/- 844 versus 2100 +/- 779 g) and more likely to have infectious complications (eight of 16 versus 29 of 120; P less than .01). Control for the presence of mycoplasmas, chlamydia, listeria, or gonorrhea failed to change the significance of these results. The usual policy was to use intrapartum ampicillin prophylaxis in asymptomatic group B streptococcus patients. However, only four of 16 remained asymptomatic and had latent periods long enough for the results of cultures obtained on admission to be available. We conclude that group B streptococcus significantly complicates the conservative management of preterm premature rupture of membranes and that the effectiveness of intrapartum prophylactic ampicillin may be compromised by awaiting the results of conventional cultures to define colonized patients.\r"

The two patients in whom an open spine defect was not detected with ultrasound had elevated revised risk estimates. When appropriate criteria are met, the estimated sensitivity of ultrasound in diagnosing open neural tube defects may be used for counseling patients at risk for a fetus with an open neural tube defect.\r"

There is disagreement regarding the optimal treatment of adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma may have a poorer prognosis than squamous carcinoma because it may be more difficult to detect and because it tends to metastasize earlier in its course.

A treatise attributed to Hippocrates is devoted to the idea, which appears to have been current in the Greek world by the fifth century BC. The doctrine was elaborately developed by subsequent Greek physicians and philosophers. It appears in the Talmud and in medieval texts, as well as in early modern medical writings. The unquestioning citation of a dogma of the Ancients until modern times is a common phenomenon in medical history. The persistence of this ancient scientific doctrine as an \"old wives' tale\" causing inappropriate patient anxiety makes it interesting to the modern obstetrician.\r"

In compression lesions and nerve entrapments, the microvascular factor plays an important pathophysiologic role for development of symptoms. Although endoneurial capillaries normally constitute a BNB helping to optimize endoneurial environment, damage to the vessels may induce a miniature closed compartment syndrome by increasing the permeability, thereby contributing to increased endoneurial fluid pressure and development of an intrafascicular edema. Surgeons, performing intraneural dissections, should be aware of the potential risks associated with intraneural bleedings, edema, and intraneural fibrosis.\r"

In the double crush syndrome as postulated by Upton and McComas, the presence of a more proximal lesion does seem to render the more distal nerve trunk more vulnerable to compression. While the exact pathophysiologic mechanism of this interaction is not yet elucidated, it most likely relates to disturbances in axonal flow kinetics and the disruption of the neurofilament architecture. On a practical level our studies show that given a more proximal root compression less involvement of the median nerve across the carpal tunnel was required to produce symptoms. Furthermore, the surgical outcome of carpal tunnel release in this double crush group was poorer than in that group with isolated carpal tunnel involvement. It is important to preoperatively identify those patients who may have double crush lesions and thus anticipate a less than optimal result from surgical release of the peripheral nerve. Finally, when the double crush syndrome is present, both entrapments may require treatment for optimal results.\r"

The pathophysiology of this process is incompletely understood but likely involves both mechanical and ischemic features. Experimentally increased pressures within the carpal canal produced reproducible progressive neuropathy. Changes in vibratory (threshold-type) sensibility appears to be more sensitive than two-point (innervation density-type) sensibility. The specific occupational etiologies of carpal neuropathy are obscured by methodologic and sociological difficulties, but clearly some occupations have high incidences of CTS. History and physical examination are usually sufficient for the diagnosis, but diagnostic assistance when required is available through electrophysiological testing, CT scanning, and possibly MRI. Each of these tests has limitations in both sensitivity and specificity. Treatment by usual conservative means should be combined with rest from possible provocative activities. Surgical release of the carpal canal is helpful in patients failing conservative therapy. Occupational modifications are important in both treatment and prevention of median neuropathy due to repetitive trauma.\r"

It does not represent a breakthrough in peripheral nerve surgery because it does not guarantee that each nerve fiber will be aligned with its own stump. Gross evaluation shows that the percentage of good results is increased by approximately 15 per cent. It must be stressed, however, that a portion of this improvement, difficult to evaluate, may be caused not by the method but by the experience we have gained over the years practicing nerve repair. The commercial fibrin glue is not yet released in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration; however, it seems, at the time of this writing, that this will be done by the first months of 1988.\r"

  ".W": "We have reviewed the morphologic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, and functional methods of evaluating PN regeneration in animal models. There are a large number of anatomic techniques that can provide clear insights into the processes of peripheral nerve regeneration. Since many of these are costly in terms of labor, careful selection of the technique appropriate for the question asked is important. Two of the more important questions are: 1) What are the neurotrophic factors produced by the distal segment that attract the growing axon tip? and 2) What are the components of the basal lamina that facilitate the directed growth of the axons? To answer these questions, whole mount preparations provide the means to economically evaluate the result of experimental manipulation of the environment. Automated nerve fiber counts will be increasingly used to help interpret electrophysiologic studies. Quantitative as well as descriptive ultrastructural analyses will continue to provide valuable data that will be needed in the interpretation of biochemical and histochemical studies. Immunohistochemical probes are sure to become more important as the range of their specificities broadens. With the diversity of anatomic methods available and their capacity to help us visualize the processes occurring during nerve regeneration they will remain a key tool in these studies. Electrophysiologic methods that integrate the CAP and correlate it with the number of functioning NF are most useful. Functional methods are beginning to become more objective and quantitative. The most precise measurements are muscle weight and the isometric response of muscle to tetanic contraction. Sensory function has now been measured objectively by Horch. Single methods of measuring PN regeneration give only limited data, but by combining methods a better understanding of PN regeneration is possible. While understanding the limitations of each method and technique, multi-parameter animal models may provide data most helpful clinically. However, because of great species variability in the reparative response, caution must be given not to extrapolate too much from animal studies. We urge investigators to use the most objective methods available to measure nerve regeneration. Recognizing these limitations, however, animal studies will continue to provide significant insights into PN regeneration and should point the way to improved clinical practice.\r"

Nerve root avulsions can be imaged directly and the newer imaging modalities now allow delineation of lesions that previously could not be studied using conventional radiography. The ability of ultrasound, CT, and MRI to differentiate soft tissue structures makes it possible, in many instances, to study the primary abnormality in trauma, nerve entrapment syndromes, and tumors. With fractures, the possibility of trauma to adjacent nerves can only be inferred on the radiographs, while the role that peripheral nerve injury plays remains controversial in other entities, such as amputation with replantation. Imaging of peripheral nerve lesions remains in its infancy. With further refinement in the signal-to-noise ratio made possible by advances in MRI technology, we may be optimistic about future imaging of peripheral nerve pathology.\r"

  ".W": "We have reviewed the technique of interfascicular nerve grafting and reviewed the results of 60 nerve grafts in 33 patients. After reviewing our results and comparing them with the literature on nerve grafts and direct repairs, the results are comparable and, in some series, better with nerve grafts. These observations support Millesi's original reports of favorable results from interfascicular nerve grafting. Although Millesi's results are better than reports by others, the overall results indicate nerve grafting is a preferable option to repair under tension. The minor sensory loss from the sural nerve donor defect was not bothersome in our patients. We will continue to prefer nerve grafting to extensive mobilization or more than moderate joint flexion to overcome gaps in nerves. Although the critical gap distance remains controversial, the following advantages of nerve grafts remain: increasing comfort in use of the microscope, the ability to do better technical apposition of the nerve fascicle groups, the ability to locate the nerve away from scarred bed, and the ease of repair of the nerve with the joint in a neutral position. These advantages far outweigh the disadvantage of increased operating time and the small sensory loss from the donor nerve harvest. We believe interfascicular nerve grafting is the contemporary standard for closing significant gaps in peripheral nerves.\r"

Use of VNGs is indicated in severely scarred recipient beds, but in beds that are less compromised, VNGs may not perform better than CNGs. The anatomy of the nerve's blood supply, methods of vascularizing a nerve graft, methods of forming cable grafts and maintaining vascular supply, and techniques for monitoring the VNG must all be understood before the surgeon can successfully transfer one of the six potential VNGs. Some clinical evidence indicates that VNGs may be superior to CNGs in moderately scarred recipient beds and, with more certainty, in digital nerve reconstruction.\r"

Two renal artery angioplasties were performed in association with intraarterial DSA. IV DSA was diagnostic in five of six patients with one false-negative result for fibromuscular dysplasia of the tertiary vessels. Intraarterial DSA images were diagnostic in 14 of 14 patients, and renal vein renin results correlated well with DSA results. In 11 patients, DSA was performed as an outpatient (hospital day-care unit) procedure. Of the 20 patients evaluated, 13 patients had abnormal DSA findings which included a hypoplastic but functioning kidney in three patients, distal small vessel abnormalities in five patients, unilateral or peripheral renal artery stenosis in four patients, and middle aortic syndrome in one patient. DSA with renal vein renin samples can be used as a diagnostic procedure for the evaluation of renal vascular hypertension in children as well as adult patients. In addition, it is a useful tool for therapeutic vascular procedures in children.\r"

Renal calcifications occurred in 20 (64%) of the infants at a mean age of 39.3 +/- 26.7 days of life. Infants with renal calcifications had shorter gestations (28.2 +/- 1.8 v 31 +/- 1.4 weeks, P less than .004) and lighter birth weights (924 +/- 195 v 1,338 +/- 100 g, P less than .004) than those infants without renal calcifications (n = 11). Furosemide administration was more common in the infants with renal calcifications (65% v 9.1%, P less than .001). The mean total dose of furosemide administered before renal calcifications were noted was 9.59 +/- 7.25 mg/kg. The 20 neonates with renal calcifications had a mean urine calcium level of 12.0 +/- 6.8 mg/kg/24 hours, mean urine calcium to creatinine ratio of 1.32 +/- 1.03 (range 0.3 to 4.45), and a mean alkaline phosphatase concentration of 961 +/- 327 IU. Initial parathyroid hormone levels were not different between the two groups, and subsequent determinations in infants with renal calcifications did not differ significantly from initial values. Renal calcifications are fairly common among very low birth weight infants, particularly in those receiving supplemental calcium and furosemide therapy. Although long-term implications of such findings are not known, close monitoring of renal function by serial determinations of urine calcium and urine calcium to creatinine ratios may identify those infants at risk for renal calcifications.\r"

Group B streptococci were isolated from each of two aspirate cultures, all four blood cultures obtained before administering antibiotics, and none of four spinal fluid cultures obtained. All five infants had previously been treated with IV antibiotics in the hospital. Two infants had been previously treated for group B streptococcal infections (one each meningitis and neonatal sepsis). In contrast, among the 29 other patients with late-onset (2 weeks of age or older) group B streptococcal infection, four had prior treatment with IV antibiotics (P less than .001). These data suggest that hospitalization and/or parenteral antibiotic therapy may be a risk factor for development of group B streptococcal cellulitis.\r"

  ".U": "88096211\r", 
  ".W": "Evidence supporting a role for abnormal apnea in sudden infant deaths is predominantly circumstantial. Investigations of infants having cyanotic episodes have shown four mechanisms for abnormal apnea. The most frequent, prolonged expiratory apnea, is particularly dangerous because it is associated with the rapid onset and progression of hypoxemia and other features suggesting alveolar ventilatory-perfusion mismatch. Seizure-induced apnea, maternally imposed obstructive apnea, and sleep-related upper airway obstructive apnea may also produce severe hypoxemia. Attempts to identify infants at risk of sudden death using measurements of cardiorespiratory variables have to date had limited success. Nevertheless, techniques for more precise, yet non-invasive, monitoring of respiratory function, including oxygenation, have been recently developed and such attempts to identify \"at risk\" infants must continue. Epidemiologic and pathologic studies have provided considerable support for the \"abnormal apnea hypothesis\" and need to be integrated with studies on the physiology of living infants. On the basis of the presently available evidence concerning prolonged apnea, it may be possible to prevent a proportion of sudden infant deaths by reducing the exposure of young infants to pertussis, respiratory syncytial virus, or other respiratory tract infections and by improving the prenatal environment.\r"

Prostaglandin E levels, a known inflammatory mediator, from the bone beneath the burn also were measured. Periosteal new bone formation was inhibited by 50 percent in animals that had debridement and wound closure with a gastrocnemius muscle flap and skin graft on postburn day 2 compared to untreated controls or animals closed with skin grafts only. There was a trend toward reduced prostaglandin E measurements from tibial sections in the early closure group compared to untreated controls.

  ".W": "The recognition of atypical or dysplastic nevomelanocytic nevi potentially provides clinicians with another means of identifying individuals at increased risk for cutaneous malignant melanoma. However, a great deal of controversy still surrounds these lesions, their significance, and the clinical and histologic criteria needed for their diagnosis at present. In general, dysplastic nevi tend to be asymmetrical and larger (greater than 5 mm) than ordinary acquired nevi, have a macular component, irregular and ill-defined borders, and haphazard (variegate) coloration. A clinical diagnosis of dysplastic nevi must be confirmed by histopathology, since not all clinically atypical nevi are dysplastic. While precise histopathologic criteria for dysplastic nevi are lacking, most authorities agree that an abnormal nevomelanocytic proliferative pattern as manifested by increased numbers of basilar melanocytes and/or abnormal junctional nevomelanocytic nesting in the setting of lentiginous epidermal hyperplasia, variable degrees of nevomelanocytic nuclear atypia, and a lymphocytic host response are consistent with a histologic diagnosis of dysplastic nevi. Current data for individuals with dysplastic nevi and a family history of cutaneous malignant melanoma (at least two family members with cutaneous malignant melanoma) indicate a relative risk for cutaneous malignant melanoma about 148 times that of the general population. In comparison, cutaneous malignant melanoma risk seems lower for individuals with familial dysplastic nevi (but without familial cutaneous malignant melanoma) and \"sporadic\" dysplastic nevi. With respect to progression to melanoma, probably the vast majority of dysplastic nevi remain stable or possibly regress. Management of individuals with histologically confirmed dysplastic nevi involves periodic skin examinations. Regional overview and life-size photography are helpful in following these patients. Patients should also be instructed in the examination of their own skin. While a definite relationship between sun exposure and dysplastic nevi remains unproved, the use of sunscreens and avoidance of unnecessary sun exposure are advised. Examination of family members for atypical melanocytic lesions is also recommended.\r"

In all five children, CT demonstrated multiple areas of nephroblastomatosis along the renal cortex. US showed a single intrarenal mass in each child (one bilaterally) but did not show the cortical nephroblastomatosis. Excretory urography also demonstrated only the dominant mass of the Wilms tumor. The superiority of CT is attributed to better spatial resolution and soft-tissue contrast differentiation and clear demarcation between nonenhanced nephroblastomatosis and enhanced normal renal parenchyma. Contrast-enhanced CT is therefore recommended for the evaluation of clinically abnormal and contralateral kidneys in all children with suspected Wilms tumor.\r"

The key factors and the magnitude of their effects varied from examination to examination, but the effects were generally large enough to have managerial significance. The factors can be evaluated by individual hospitals to produce customized estimates of average examination times. The data presented in this report can be used in management control systems by radiology departments in hospitals of varying sizes and teaching characteristics.\r"

In three patients, both types were present. In 19 patients, histologic (n = 12) and/or angiographic (n = 16) correlation was available. Among 13 patients with angiographic studies and signals over 3 kHz, arteriovenous shunting was demonstrated in six. The ratio of the systolic to diastolic Doppler shift is a function of vascular impedance. This systolic/diastolic index was less than 3 in eight patients with histologic correlation. All eight had prominent vascular spaces, and the flow in such thin-walled, endothelium-lined spaces would account for the low-impedance signals. Of nine patients with systolic/diastolic indexes of 3 or less and angiographic correlation, three had marked and four had moderate tumor staining.\r"

We have called this the double bleb sign. Since the developing embryo and its cardiac pulsation are located between these two blebs, the size of an early embryo can be measured. The crown-rump length thus measured corresponds well to that described in embryologic textbooks, and an embryo as small as 2 mm (5 weeks 3 days) can be measured with use of this method. Three stages of development of the amniotic sac-embryo-yolk sac complex can be identified with US, and they are useful in dating the pregnancy. These three stages are 1, a simple double bleb, 2, a double bleb with a stalk, and 3, a double bleb with a separating yolk sac. As the amniotic sac enlarges, strands of echoes may be seen within the chorionic cavity and should be differentiated from amniotic bands, which may cause serious fetal abnormality. Separation of the amniotic from the chorionic membrane before the 13th week is normal but may be abnormal after the 17th week of gestation. Separation of the chorionic membrane from underlying decidua, however, is abnormal at any stage of pregnancy.\r"

The techniques provided equivalent diagnostic information in 60%-84% of cases. Transvaginal sonography was particularly helpful when exclusion of ectopic pregnancy was the clinical concern. Individual organs and fine structures were better seen transvaginally, but the regional survey offered by the transabdominal full-bladder approach remains necessary to provide anatomic orientation, particularly when the patient has not been studied previously.\r"

TV sonography added diagnostically useful information in 25 of 28 patients with cystic pathologic changes in the adnexa uteri. Eight of 12 patients with tuboovarian abscess and nonspecific adnexal masses visualized with TA sonography had tube-shaped fluid collections characteristic of pyosalpinx identified with TV sonography. TV sonography added diagnostically useful information in all seven patients with diseases of the cul-de-sac (rectouterine fossa) and allowed differentiation of adnexal from primary uterine disease in three patients with TA sonograms on which findings were equivocal. It also expedited the diagnosis of a tubal pregnancy in ten of 14 patients and was useful in the detection of adhesions and perforated intrauterine devices. These results indicate that adjunctive TV sonography can provide important diagnostic information.\r"

Vascular ultrasound (US) offers distinct advantages in confirming the clinical suspicion of disease or suggesting the need for further tests. The authors encountered three consecutive cases of antepartum proximal vein thrombosis during a 6-month period (0.6 case per 1,000 deliveries). Lack of venous flow accentuation and lack of diameter change at the common femoral vein during the Valsalva maneuver are indications for iliac venography and suggest the diagnosis of iliac vein thrombosis. In distal iliac and proximal femoral vein thrombosis, noncompressibility of the vein and the presence of echogenic material within are indicative of acute thrombus.\r"

Although there was no statistically significant difference in lesion size and path length between the two groups, use of stereotaxis compared with hand guidance decreased by 75% the number of needle manipulations required to place a needle within a lesion. With the stereotaxic method, only 43 needle manipulations were required to confirm a needle placement in 40 lesions, with no lesion requiring more than two attempts. Use of stereotaxis decreased the number of localization scans by 80% and biopsy time by 50%. It is concluded that CT-guided needle placements with hand guidance are often inaccurate and, unless the lesion is large, require multiple needle manipulations to place a needle within the lesion. Stereotaxis-guided biopsies, on the other hand, decrease radiation exposure, biopsy time, and trauma from multiple needle punctures.\r"

In 28 of the 44 patients, intraoperative US was performed without the examiner being aware of the surgical findings. The sensitivity was 84%. Four insulinomas were not palpable but were visualized sonographically. The combined sensitivity of intraoperative US and surgical palpation for detecting solitary insulinomas was 100%. High-frequency intraoperative US is valuable for detecting occult solitary insulinomas and considerably useful for determining the proximity of insulinomas to the pancreatic and bile ducts.\r"

Of eight patients who underwent ultrasound (US) in the past 5 years, six (75%) were found to have tumor. The sizes of the tumors ranged from 1.6 to 2 cm. An intraluminal, polypoid mass in the distal part of the common bile duct was seen in four patients. In the other two patients, a sharply delineated mass gave rise to abrupt termination of the distal duct. Improved US resolution, more experience with this modality, and accurate diagnosis of these tumors with US will contribute to improved detection and prompt treatment.\r"

In addition, periportal linear areas of increased attenuation, possibly calcified, were identified at follow-up, nonenhanced CT. Some abscesses were better seen on nonenhanced CT scans, while others became visible only with enhancement. Although lesions not seen at US were often seen at CT, the opposite was also true. In two cases, pathologic proof of candidiasis was established even when all imaging studies were normal. For maximum imaging sensitivity, patients should be studied with US and nonenhanced and enhanced CT. Even when both US and CT scans are negative, if there is a strong clinical suggestion of candidiasis, open biopsy is recommended.\r"

Benign breast disease was diagnosed histologically in 106 women, while carcinoma was established in 95. The sensitivities of physical examination, mammography, US, and thermography were 0.88, 0.94, 0.78, and 0.49, respectively. US alone had the highest sensitivity in correct diagnosis of a benign solid breast mass and had the highest accuracy (0.84). Use of four modalities increased the preoperative diagnostic true-positive rate to 0.97, with some decline in specificity. Multimodality testing seems particularly beneficial in pre- and perimenopausal patients.\r"

In contrast to the conventional pulmonary angiograms, all of which were considered satisfactory, 13 of 54 digital subtraction angiograms (24%) were technically unsatisfactory. The interpretable digital subtraction angiograms had 81% sensitivity and 64% specificity. With DSA, one cannot exclude the diagnosis of PE on the basis of normal angiograms (27% false-positive results) as one can with perfusion scanning. On the other hand, DSA showed good sensitivity (94%) in medium to major PE. Therefore it may be the technique of choice in the screening of life-threatening PE for which curative emergency treatment with thrombolytic agents or embolectomy is often necessary.\r"

MotB--alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins were constructed to identify likely periplasmic domains of the MotB molecule. Fusions distal to a putative membrane-spanning segment near the amino terminus of MotB exhibited alkaline phosphatase activity, indicating that an extensive carboxyl-terminal portion of MotB may be located on the periplasmic side of the membrane. Protease treatment of MotB in spheroplasts confirmed this view. The simple transmembrane organization of MotB is difficult to reconcile with a role as a proton conductor.\r"

Transposition of the Ty element carrying the gene occurs at multiple sites in the genome. Two genes, a bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase gene and the yeast TRPl gene, were amplified in this way. Although the amplified genes were about 1 kilobase in length, they were amplified to about the same extent as a 40-base pair segment.

In addition, these perivascular cells are fully competent to present antigen to lymphocytes in an appropriately restricted manner. These findings are important for bone marrow transplantation and for neuroimmunological diseases such as multiple sclerosis.\r"

Mitochondria isolated from cms-T maize are specifically sensitive to a toxin (BmT-toxin) produced by the fungal pathogen Bipolaris maydis, race T, and the carbamate insecticide methomyl. A mitochondrial gene unique to cms-T maize, which produces a 13-kilodalton polypeptide associated with cytoplasmic male sterility, was expressed in Escherichia coli. After addition of BmT-toxin or methomyl, inhibition of whole cell respiration and swelling of spheroplasts were observed in Escherichia coli cultures producing the novel mitochondrial protein; these effects are similar to those observed with isolated cms-T mitochondria. The amino-terminal region of the 13-kilodalton polypeptide appears to be essential for proper interaction with the BmT-toxin and methomyl. These results implicate the 13-kilodalton polypeptide in conferring toxin sensitivity to mitochondria of cms-T maize.\r"

The down-regulation was enhanced by point mutation of Tyr527 (a site that is phosphorylated in pp60c-src and that inhibits kinase activity) or by substitution of the viral-src for the cellular-src carboxyl-terminal coding region. Mutation of Tyr416 (a site phosphorylated upon Tyr527 mutation) suppresses both the down-regulation of communication by Tyr527 mutation and that by gene overexpression. The regulation of communication by src may be important in the control of embryonic development and cellular growth.\r"

Splenectomy and/or corticosteroids remain the mainstay of therapy, with permanent remissions induced in 75% of patients. We review alternative forms of therapy such as immunosuppressive agents, high-dose gamma-globulin, and others to enable the practicing physician to select the best treatment for patients refractory to standard therapy. Age appears to influence response to therapy and morbidity, with advancing age imparting a poorer prognosis.\r"

An antibody is termed monoclonal if each immunoglobulin molecule is produced by a single clone of cells and, thus, is identical in both the heavy and light chain structure to every other molecule in the preparation. Monoclonal preparations provide more consistent bioefficacy and predictable toxicity than do polyclonal products. Studies in nonhuman primate allograft recipients have established the immunosuppressive efficacy of several mAb. The results of pilot trial studies using a pan-T-cell mAb, OKT3, either prophylactically or at the time of acute rejection have revealed OKT3 to be remarkably immunosuppressive in man. OKT3 has subsequently been shown in multicenter, randomized trials to be more effective than conventional suppression in reversing renal and hepatic allograft rejection. In uncontrolled trial studies, similar efficacy in reversing cardiac rejection has been reported. Despite these impressive results, several limitations to OKT3 therapy persist. These include febrile and other systemic symptoms after the first or second infusion, a frequency of recurrent rejection episodes and the development of antibodies to the murine protein which may preclude subsequent treatment with the same mAb. Other murine mAb, such as CBL1 and anti-T12, have been noted to produce less side effects; however, these mAb have not been as effective. The next generation of mAb will be selected to minimize these limitations. It is anticipated that future mAb protocols will specifically suppress only selected subsets of T cells, and that these mAb may be chimeric or even human in structure to limit their immunogenicity.\r"

The additional use of any modality of IOPL is well entrenched in modern surgical practice. It does, however, owe more to force of habit or prejudice than to sound scientific evidence. Most, if not all, experimental or clinical studies suggesting the benefits of IOPL suffer from many deficiencies, some of which we made a point of emphasizing. In broad terms, one could recognize three major pitfalls invalidating these studies. First, the design of some of the experimental studies bears no resemblance to clinical situations. For example, laparotomy was omitted in either both arms of the trial or in the control arm. Second, far too frequently, the data were drawn from retrospective or uncontrolled trials. Although the value of such studies cannot be denied, the literature is replete with examples of perpetuation of erroneuos concepts through lack of properly designed prospective, randomized controlled studies. Third, many of the trials were performed before the revolutionary introduction of perioperative antibiotics in clinical practice. Of greater concern is the existence of studies which, for unexplained reasons, have ignored this principle. From this review, it seems that neither the benefit nor the safety of IOPL with crystalloid or antiseptic solution has been established beyond any reasonable doubt. The theory for the addition of judicious antibiotics to the IOPL may be stronger, although no absolute proof exists to suggest that this practice will decrease mortality rates from intra-abdominal infections. Obviously, there is a need for well constructed, controlled, prospective clinical trials to examine the role of IOPL in modern surgical groups of patients assembled under the label intra-abdominal infection. Until some stratification of peritonitis in various clinical studies is undertaken, either by how ill the patient is or the source of contamination and its duration, it will be difficult to compare studies from different centers.\r"

  ".W": "Memory and language dysfunction has been sporadically reported following stereotaxic thalamotomies. In order to determine which patients are at greatest risk and to better define the nature of this dysfunction, we have prospectively evaluated 18 patients undergoing stereotaxic thalamotomies for movement disorders (MDs). Patients were evaluated clinically, with computed tomography (CT) and with memory and language protocols (MLPs) pre- and postoperatively. Patients exhibiting postoperative deficits were again evaluated with the MLP on follow-up visits to the clinic. Significant changes in memory and language function occurred in 7 out of 18 patients. These 7 patients had diverse etiologies for their MDs. Five of the 18 patients had undergone previous thalamotomies on the contralateral side. Three of these 5 patients with bilateral thalamotomies experienced postoperative functional impairments in memory and language while only 4 of 13 patients with a unilateral thalamotomy experienced these problems. The postoperative functional impairments noted were primarily those requiring orientation and speech. All patients with postoperative memory and language impairments were again evaluated with MLPs months after the operation. In 3 of 7 patients, no improvement was noted, while the remaining 4 did recover to baseline. More severe deficits tended to occur in those patients with ventriculomegaly or evidence of other major cerebral tissue loss by preoperative CT scan and in those patients with lower MLP scores preoperatively. Postoperative memory and language dysfunction was not correlated with the number or size of the lesions made, the postoperative general neurologic examination or CT scans, or the clinical response of the MDs. From our data, it appears that patients with more profound neurologic compromise and/or bilateral involvement as evidenced by poor performance on the MLP, tissue loss on CT scanning, or previous thalamic lesion, are most at risk for memory and language dysfunction postoperatively. However, this dysfunction is not necessarily permanent. Preoperative evaluation with MLPs and CT scanning appear to be of value in predicting those patients at greatest risk for postoperative and language dysfunction.\r"

In children a congenital pathogenesis appears more convincing because of the higher frequency in the first 2 years of life, the often peripheral site (41.6%), the high frequency of large (50%) or giant (26.8%) aneurysms, and the association with other cerebral and vascular congenital abnormalities. Onset was nonhemorrhagic in 18.1% of cases compared with 2.5% in adults. The surgical outcome seems better in children than in adult patients in terms of both morbidity and mortality.\r"

If flow velocity is increased because of contralateral disease, this criterion may overstate the degree of stenosis. To investigate this, three centers contributed 167 patients to a study of carotid Doppler frequency analysis. Each patient underwent bilateral carotid studies by a standard protocol with use of continuous-wave 5 MHz Doppler probe. There were 309 patent and 25 occluded internal carotids seen on subsequent angiographs. Each patient side was categorized by the severity of ipsilateral disease (less than 45%, 45% to 70%, 71% to 99%, occlusion) and then subgrouped by contralateral disease. For all carotid arteries, the optimal peak frequency to detect 45% or more stenosis was 5500 Hz, with an overall accuracy of 92.2%. Within the three classifications of ipsilateral stenosis, a trend was noted that related increasing peak frequency to greater degrees of contralateral disease. This was most apparent when the contralateral internal carotid artery was occluded. Of all false-positive errors, 43% were accounted for by this subset that represented 15% of the total population. For the 25 patients with occlusion opposite a stenosis, the 5500 Hz cutoff of Doppler peak frequency yielded only 76% accuracy; an ROC curve showed that a cutoff value of 8500 Hz improved overall accuracy to 92% for these patients. By applying two cutoff criteria--5500 Hz for those with patent contralateral internal carotids and 8500 Hz for those in whom a contralateral Doppler signal was not detected--the overall accuracy for all patients improved to 93.3%. It is concluded that contralateral occlusion affects Doppler peak frequency by increasing the velocity in the companion carotid artery, whereas severe contralateral stenosis did not result in a consistent pattern of increased velocity.\r"

  ".W": "With the advent of cyclosporine A, heart transplantation has become a widely accepted treatment for patients with end-stage cardiac disease that is not amenable to medical or surgical treatment. Between July 1982 and December 1985, 86 heart transplantations were performed at the Texas Heart Institute with cyclosporine A and prednisone used for immunosuppression. Thirty patients had complications requiring general surgical consultation. The pancreas and biliary tracts were most commonly affected. Pancreatitis developed in sixteen patients; five patients required operative intervention, resulting in a 40% mortality rate. Five of nine patients with cholecystitis required cholecystectomy. All patients survived the procedures. Other gastrointestinal complications included colonic ileus, bowel perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric outlet obstruction, and perirectal abscess. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplantation are susceptible to life-threatening infections and are at risk of serious complications requiring general surgical intervention. Better results can be obtained in these complex clinical situations when complications are identified early and managed aggressively through the adjustment of immunosuppression, adequate selection of antimicrobial agents, and proper timing of surgical intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Osteonecrosis is a common complication of renal transplantation and is an obstacle to rehabilitation. While prednisone has long been implicated as causative, the sporadic nature of aseptic necrosis (ASN) is poorly understood. Four hundred forty-four patients received kidney transplants (TX) between January 1978 and December 1984. Fifty-two patients (16%) have developed ASN. This retrospective study was developed in an attempt to define potential etiologic factors. Age, sex, donor, source, primary renal disease, duration of dialysis, and pre-TX parathyroidectomy did not correlate with ASN. Prednisone administration and duration of use prior to transplantation was equally common in ASN and control patients. Black recipients had a twofold frequency of ASN, although this association did not quite reach significance (p = 0.07). Pretransplant x-ray evidence of either osteopenia or renal osteodystrophy was significant (p less than 0.01) and apparent in 23 of 52 patients (44%). ASN was associated with a history of early acute rejection (p less than 0.02), higher final serum creatinine (p = 0.07), and greater mean prednisone (p less than 0.0001). The mean linear trend of daily prednisone dose was also significant (p less than 0.03). This study suggests that ASN is three times more likely to occur if radiographic evidence is apparent before TX. Rejection and higher daily steroid dosage correlate with a greater incidence of ASN, and blacks appear to be at greater risk.\r"

The gallbladders were harvested, and the mucosa and serosa were separately exposed to arachidonic acid in an in vitro incubation chamber at 37 degrees C. Cholesterol feeding stimulated the rates of synthesis of PGI2, but this effect was limited to the serosa (and not the mucosa) of gallbladders from female (but not male) animals.

Stroke was the third leading cause of death among U.S. blacks in 1982, accounting for 18,698 deaths, 8.25% of the total. Black men aged 35-74 years were 2.5 times and black women 2.4 times as likely as whites to die of stroke. A long-term decline in stroke mortality rates continued through 1982, with the declines since 1968 probably due to improved hypertension control. Data on morbidity trends are lacking. About 7% of black men and 11% of black women in the U.S. noninstitutionalized population aged 65 and over reported having had a stroke in 1977, black women having the highest prevalence of any group. In several studies, black women had higher incidence rates of stroke than white women in each age group. Black men had higher incidence rates than whites up to age 75 years. Survivorship and outcome following stroke may have been poorer in blacks than in whites. Advanced age and elevated blood pressure were the only putative risk factors for stroke for which published data were adequate to firmly establish the association in blacks. Thus, data are needed to examine trends in stroke incidence and survivorship in blacks and to assess the relation of many variables to the risk of stroke.\r"

Radiologists should be familiar with this system so that they can direct the imaging part of the workup efficiently. The ATS classification of regional lymph nodes also has been updated both to take into account the growing recognition of superior diaphragmatic nodes in lung cancer and to change the supraclavicular lymph nodes from distant metastases to thoracic nodes (in keeping with the revised TNM system). Use of this classification helps radiologists record accurately which nodes are involved and also prompts the film reader to examine all parts of the mediastinum carefully and systematically. The use of CT for staging lung cancer is well established, but its appropriate use and limitations should be recognized. The usefulness of MR in special cases is now well described, but the hoped-for tissue specificity for tumor has not been realized. Imaging techniques have a primary role in screening for spread of disease, but confirmation by tissue biopsy is a required step in correct management.\r"

Thirteen patients had minimal or no acute GVHD, with viral infection proved in eight and strongly suspected in four others; the remaining patient was thought to have nonspecific inflammatory bowel disease. Five patients had pure acute GVHD, and 10 patients had viral enteritis superimposed on acute GVHD. Radiographic abnormalities were found in the gastrointestinal tract in both acute GVHD and viral infection and were more extensive than previously reported. Findings were similar in both entities, although gastric abnormalities were not seen in pure acute GVHD but only in viral infection, either alone or together with acute GVHD. Prolonged small bowel barium coating occurred in both viral infection and acute GVHD. Fold thickening evolved into fold effacement with a shaggy contour in two patients with viral infection. Colonic findings in all groups mimicked ulcerative colitis. Our data indicate that differentiation between acute GVHD and viral enteritis is not possible on the basis of radiographic findings alone. Both entities should be considered when gastrointestinal inflammation occurs after bone marrow transplantation.\r"

Intraluminal thrombi of less than 5 weeks duration appeared markedly hyperintense relative to liver and muscle on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Older thrombi appeared hyperintense relative to liver and muscle in eight of 11 cases, but only on T2-weighted images. MR showed thrombi in 11% more portal vessels than did CT (MR = 30, CT = 27) and in 28% more vessels than did sonography (MR = 32, sonography = 25). MR also showed 24% more collateral vessels than did CT (MR = 31, CT = 25) and 50% more vessels than did sonography (MR = 33, sonography = 22). Third-echo images (echo time = 96 msec, repetition time = 1500-2150 msec) verified the presence of venous thrombi in 28 (93%) of 30 PVT vessels, and they differentiated flow-related intravascular signal from true thrombi in six (17%) of 36 portal hypertension vessels. We conclude that MR is a valuable tool for imaging portal vein thrombosis. MR is a good substitute for CT and can be more informative than sonography.\r"

Twenty-six patients underwent allograft biopsy. In eight patients in whom the biopsy was performed more than 48 hr after MR examination and in 19 patients who did not have a biopsy, the subsequent clinical course was sufficiently diagnostic to determine the specific cause of the transplant dysfunction. Corticomedullary differentiation, graded from 0 to 3, was not helpful in separating rejection (n = 20) from acute tubular necrosis (n = 9), drug toxicity (n = 7), pyelonephritis (n = 2), or normal grafts (n = 7) because of overlap between groups (sensitivity =; 60%, specificity = 60%). In the six patients with two or more MR studies, serial changes in corticomedullary differentiation were not consistent and could not be used to diagnose rejection. When any abnormality of allograft sinus fat, size or shape, or corticomedullary differentiation was considered, the sensitivity for the diagnosis of rejection approached 80%; however, specificity was low (48%). We conclude that MR imaging is not sufficiently accurate to replace transplant biopsy and therefore has a limited role in the evaluation of transplant dysfunction.\r"

Four patients developed gastrointestinal rotavirus infections and were shown to have dilated proximal small-bowel folds on upper gastrointestinal studies. At the time of this writing, the prognosis for the five surviving infants is good. We conclude that the radiographs of infants who have received heart transplants show an unusual cardiac contour and slight cardiomegaly. Increasing cardiomegaly can alert one to early rejection. Prominent folds in the small bowel are of uncertain origin and significance, but they may be related to infection resulting from immunosuppression.\r"

  ".U": "88103249\r", 
  ".W": "While the total ischemic burden on the left ventricle represents the combined effects of both symptomatic and asymptomatic myocardial ischemia, the total vascular burden has many components including an increased systemic peripheral vascular resistance, an increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and an increased coronary vascular resistance. These factors may all influence ventricular function. Hypertension contributes significantly to the vascular burden, especially when combined with left ventricular hypertrophy, which predisposes to ischemia by multiple mechanisms. In patients with hypertension and cardiomegaly, sublingual nifedipine has been shown to increase left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and the average diastolic filling rate. In the presence of acute myocardial infarction, nifedipine moves the LV function curve onto a better Frank-Starling relationship as pulmonary wedge pressure falls or stays the same and cardiac output rises. However, because of the delicate balance between myocardial perfusion and the benefits of afterload reduction, including improved remodelling, nifedipine should be given only to selected patients. In congestive heart failure, low-dose nifedipine reduces the afterload and has been shown to have beneficial effects in the majority of patients. Two specific adverse outcomes in only two patients have been reported, one with initial hypotension and one given high-dose nifedipine. Combination nifedipine-beta blocker therapy has been shown to be favorable in the treatment of all varieties of angina, hypertension, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, when administered appropriately, nifedipine reduces the total vascular burden on the heart in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, with consequent improvement in LV function and a diminished threat of potential myocardial ischemia.\r"

A cross-over, single-blind, completely randomized study was planned in order to evaluate whether the control of thrombin generation affected the increase in anginal activity. After discharge from the hospital, 24 patients (18 men and 6 women, aged 40 to 69 years) suffering from spontaneous angina were followed up to 12 months and were alternatively treated during two consecutive 6-month periods with calcium heparin, 12,500 IU by the subcutaneous route, or with placebo by the intramuscular route, in addition to the usual antianginal medications. Thrombin generation and clinical activity of angina were assessed every 15 days by measuring fibrinopeptide A (FPA) plasma levels and by grading in three classes (symptomless, mildly symptomatic, and severely symptomatic) the anginal activity on the basis of the number and the time concentration of the ischemic attacks and ECG changes. Low-dose heparin treatment significantly reduced both the FPA plasma level (from 4.1 +/- 3.7 to 2.3 +/- 1.8 ng/ml, p less than 0.001) and the clinical activity of angina. During heparin treatment, the frequency of the observations in the severely and mildly symptomatic classes decreased, respectively, by 53% and by 30%, whereas that in the symptomless class increased by 23% (p less than 0.001) in comparison with the period on placebo. Present results indicate that the control of thrombin generation obtained by low-dose heparin treatment favorably affects the degree of anginal activity in patients with spontaneous angina.\r"

A 24 hour ambulatory ECG was obtained before therapy in 3290 patients 2 to 21 days after myocardial infarction. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and prevalence were calculated for four definitions of ventricular arrhythmia with either total or sudden death (death in less than 1 hour of observed symptoms) as an endpoint. These indexes were obtained using the first 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours plus a random hour, a random daytime hour, and a random nighttime hour of the 24-hour ECG of 1336 placebo patients. For both total death and sudden death, as the duration of monitoring increased, (1) prevalence increased, (2) sensitivity increased, (3) specificity decreased, (4) positive predictive value either changed very little or decreased, and (5) negative predictive value was high (greater than 90%) and increased slightly. None of the 3 random hours offered anything beyond the first hour. The Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial data, which were based on an average follow-up of 25 months, show that as the number of hours of ambulatory monitoring increase, the percentages of patients identified at risk or not at risk (the positive and negative predictive values) do not change much. Twenty-four hours of monitoring does not appear to be the optimal time duration for deciding whether to treat arrhythmias in patients after infarction.\r"

Elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and elevated blood pressure are associated with more extensive and more severe atherosclerosis and also with greater risk of clinical disease. Cigarette smoking is firmly established as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and peripheral vascular disease. It is associated with more severe coronary atherosclerosis, but not enough to account for the twofold or greater risk of coronary heart disease among smokers. Smoking is associated with much more severe atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta, which is consistent with the much greater risk of aortic aneurysm and peripheral vascular disease among smokers. Smoking induces a wide variety of physiologic responses, some of which appear likely to be involved in accelerating atherogenesis or increasing the probability of thrombosis. These responses include reduction in plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, elevation in plasma fibrinogen concentration, and elevation in white blood cell count. The rapid amelioration of the risk of cardiovascular disease after cessation of smoking suggests that these processes are readily reversible.\r"

In healthy subjects the increase in heart rate occurs in the absence of peripheral vasoconstriction. In the studies reported here, short-term beta-blockade increased peripheral vascular resistance during smoking, more so for the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol than for the beta 1-selective blocker atenolol. However, after 3 months of continuous treatment of hypertensive patients with beta-blockers, smoking produced similar increases in blood pressure for atenolol and propranolol. Smoking attenuated the beneficial blood pressure-lowering effect of beta-blockers. Short-term clinical studies with the nonselective alpha-inhibitor phentolamine have suggested that blockade of arteriolar alpha-receptors may eliminate the increase in blood pressure response to smoking. Treatment with alpha-inhibitors also increased coronary sinus blood flow in patients with atherosclerotic artery disease. For patients who smoke, alpha-inhibiting drugs may provide beneficial therapy for hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders.\r"

However, the rapid regression of cardiovascular risk within the first year of quitting smoking is difficult to explain solely in terms of vascular disease. Recent evidence indicates that plasma fibrinogen, which has been prospectively associated with the risk of ischemic heart disease, is elevated in smokers. Similarly, results from studies investigating thromboxane metabolite excretion in urine confirm those involving radiolabeled platelet turnover, suggesting that platelets are activated in the circulation of chronic smokers. Altered hemostatic function, either as a direct result of smoking or caused by smoking-induced vascular damage, may account for the more rapidly reversible component of cardiovascular risk observed in chronic smokers.\r"

In the first study 312 patients received hydrochlorothiazide titrated from 25 to 100 mg twice daily to lower diastolic blood pressure (BP) to less than 90 mm Hg. Of 121 patients aged 55 to 65 the decrease in BP averaged -21.8/-12.9 mm Hg, while in the 191 patients younger than 55 the reduction averaged -15.7/-11.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001; p = 0.048, respectively). Both systolic and diastolic BP reductions averaged significantly more in older whites; in older blacks it was systolic BP only. An additional 298 patients received titrated doses of propranolol alone. In this group there were no significant differences in BP response between younger patients and patients aged 55 to 65 except in the subgroup of white patients older than 60, in whom the systolic reduction was significantly less than in the younger patients. In a second study of bendroflumethiazide alone and with nadolol, systolic BP decreased more in older than in younger patients but there was no age-related reduction with nadolol alone. In the third trial captopril was first given alone and later with hydrochlorothiazide. There were no age-related differences with captopril alone, but after the addition of hydrochlorothiazide there was a trend toward a greater antihypertensive response in the patients aged 55 to 69. Thus, responsiveness of older patients varies with the type of antihypertensive drug. Age appears to increase the antihypertensive response to thiazide diuretics but not to beta-adrenergic blocking drugs or to captopril.\r"

  ".W": "What is double-orifice mitral valve anatomically and embryologically? In 27 postmortem cases, an anomaly of the tensor apparatus was always found. These malformations may be summarized as: (1) chordal ring; (2) accessory papillary muscle or muscles; (3) subdividing muscular ridge; (4) fused papillary muscles (parachute mitral valve); (5) crossing chordae tendineae; and (6) central fibrous subdivision. More than 1 of these anomalies often coexisted per case. Double-orifice mitral valve almost always consisted of abnormal holes in essentially normal leaflets, rather than of abnormal fibrous bridges or adhesions between normal leaflets. Since these fibrous \"bridges\" between the smaller accessory orifice and the larger main orifice are composed of mitral leaflet tissue and chordae, not fibrous adhesions, these bridges should not be transected surgically, to avoid iatrogenic mitral regurgitation. The accessory (smaller) orifice was at the anterolateral commissure in 11 cases (41%), at the posteromedial commissure in 12 (44%) and there was a central fibrous subdivision with approximately equal-sized orifices in 4 (15%). The atrioventricular (AV) canal was normally divided in 12 cases (44%) and a common AV canal was present in 15 (56%). When the accessory orifice was at the anterolateral commissure, the AV canal usually was normally divided (8 of 11, 73%). But when the accessory orifice was at the posteromedial commissure, a common AV canal almost always was present (11 of 12, 92%). Functionally, the mitral valve was normal in 13 (48%), regurgitated in 7 (26%) and stenotic in 7 (26%). The key to the diagnostic and surgical understanding of the double-orifice mitral valve is the underlying tensor apparatus.\r"

Risk factors identifying those patients most likely to have further complications include the presence of heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction, and the relative severity of these conditions. Those patients who fit into high-risk groups are the ones most likely to benefit, although this benefit is still unproved. If antiarrhythmic therapy is given, it is recommended that it be started in the hospital and that the efficacy of treatment be assessed by serial electrophysiologic-pharmacologic testing or noninvasive means. Empiric treatment, especially started out-of-hospital, is discouraged because it is least likely to benefit the patient and most likely to cause harm.\r"

Among conduction abnormalities, the mechanisms most widely referred to are reentry and reflection. Although it is relatively easy to distinguish among mechanisms at the cellular electrophysiologic level, distinction is far more difficult in the intact heart and in the clinic. The patterns of response to electrical stimulation of the heart are reviewed to demonstrate the confusion that can occur when one attempts to distinguish mechanisms. In addition, means to aid in the process of distinction are suggested.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years an enhanced interest among researchers combined with the availability of new technologies has increased our knowledge of the mechanisms that generate arrhythmias in patients with ischemic heart disease. Convincing evidence has been obtained to support the occurrence of reentry in ischemic myocardium. This has been especially apparent in canine studies in the surviving layers overlying infarctions several days after coronary occlusion. In this planar model, the reentry circuit forms a figure-8 configuration around an arc of functional block due to refractoriness; the center of the arc is the site of unidirectional block and reentry. The reentry circuit is sustained by wavefronts of activation encircling segments in which the tissue on either side is alternately receptive and refractory, a variant of the leading circle model of reentry. The relatively prolonged refractoriness in ischemic tissue is due to time-dependent refractoriness, i.e., postrepolarization refractoriness, which is most prominent in more severely depolarized cells. Slow conduction is related in part to primary depression of the fast channels. There is a great variation in refractory periods in ischemic tissue because of variation in action potential duration and in the duration of time-dependent refractoriness. The depolarized resting potentials of cells in acute ischemia are due in part to extracellular accumulation of potassium and intracellular accumulation of calcium. In the latter stages of ischemia it is likely that abnormalities of ion distribution across the sarcolemma play a role. It has also been demonstrated that ischemic Purkinje fibers show abnormal automaticity, i.e., enhanced phase 4 depolarization at depolarized diastolic potentials, and afterdepolarizations with triggered firing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the past, surgical treatment of arrhythmias has been reserved for patients with disabling paroxysmal or incessant tachycardia refractory to medical management, severe life-threatening arrhythmia or aborted episodes of sudden death. However, tachyarrhythmias that are refractory to pharmacologic therapy because of drug inefficacy, noncompliance or limiting side effects are not uncommon. Although nonpharmacologic treatment of arrhythmias carries with it a one-time period of higher risk (i.e., when the patient undergoes surgery), it is curative and often preferable to the uncertainty and possibly higher cumulative risk associated with medical management.\r"

  ".U": "88103357\r", 
  ".W": "Electrical devices can be used for preventing and terminating tachycardia and for achieving hemodynamic improvement during a continuing tachycardia. Conventional approaches to tachycardia prevention include pacing at physiologic rates to prevent brady-cardia-related tachycardia or tachycardias associated with prolonged QT-interval syndromes. More exotic techniques, such as those involving stimulation during the refractory period, are undergoing investigation. Some tachycardias cannot be easily terminated or recur incessantly. Hemodynamics can be improved by pacing methods that result in a narrower QRS complex by coupled pacing and, in supraventricular tachycardias, by pacing rapidly enough to create atrioventricular block. Most clinical tachycardias are caused by reentry. Careful analysis of the timing of individual stimuli that successfully terminate tachycardias indicate that critical relations exist in the conduction velocity, refractoriness and physical properties and dimensions of the reentry circuit and the remaining myocardium. Elucidating these relations has permitted inferences into the mechanisms by which pacing terminates or accelerates tachycardias. A vast number of pacing patterns have evolved for use in tachycardia termination. None of these appear to be foolproof. There is widespread and justified concern about the risk of acceleration of tachycardia when antitachycardia pacing is used in the ventricle. Experience indicates that only a few patients are suitable for termination of ventricular tachycardia by pacing, but these carefully selected patients may do well. Both the results and the potential for widespread use may be better with pacing for termination of supraventricular tachycardia. Life-threatening tachycardias or fibrillation can be terminated by direct-current countershock. Although many technical problems remain, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, possibly combined with antitachycardia pacemakers, will play an increasing role in the management or serious arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Antiarrhythmic drugs have been recognized to possess 1 or more classes of antiarrhythmic action. This classification scheme is useful, but has major limitations because the available drugs and their metabolites have multiple actions. This report presents an overview of the distinguishing features of the most frequently used agents having class I or III actions. Agents with class I actions are local anesthetic agents that depress the fast inward depolarizing sodium current and thereby slow the rate of the rise of the action potential (phase 0). This category is further divided into classes IA, IB, and IC according to the degree of potency as sodium channel inhibitors, and the individual effects of the drug on action potential, conduction velocity and repolarization. Included in the spectrum of agents with class I action are quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, lidocaine, tocainide, mexiletine, flecainide, amiodarone, encainide and lorcainide. The antiarrhythmic drugs that exert class III action lengthen repolarization and refractoriness; included in this category are amiodarone, quinidine, bretylium and sotalol. Because of the broad range of effects that antiarrhythmic agents may exert, safe and effective therapy requires a thorough familiarity with the pharmacologic profile of each drug administered and a careful evaluation of the presenting condition and the patient history. In some cases, a multiple drug regimen may be most appropriate. Various combinations such as class IA and IB agents, have been shown to slow conduction synergistically and increase refractoriness while keeping adverse effects to a minimum.\r"

Because of the lack of uniform reporting of data, guidelines have been suggested to evaluate proarrhythmic events. Of 412 patients receiving 1,080 drug trials for treatment of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, proarrhythmic events occurred in 33 patients (8%) and 43 drug trials (4%). The proarrhythmic event occurred more often during treatment for sustained ventricular tachycardia than for ventricular fibrillation or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The initial step in treating a proarrhythmic event is to discontinue the offending drug. Further recommendations are based on the nature of the particular arrhythmia.\r"

These options include empirical drug therapy on a trial and error basis, drug therapy based on the results of electrophysiologic testing and nonpharmacologic treatment including operative therapy, catheter ablation and antitachycardia devices. Empirical drug therapy is appropriate when the tachycardia is relatively well tolerated and the patient has access to a medical facility. Therapy guided by electrophysiologic testing is more appropriate for patients with severe symptoms during tachycardia, patients with a potential for more serious arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and in patients who have failed to respond to empirical trials of drug therapy. Electrophysiologic testing usually provides information about the precise mechanism responsible for the tachycardia and allows verification of drug efficacy. It is a strict prerequisite for operative, ablative or antitachycardia device therapy. The choice of therapy depends a great deal on local expertise, patient preference and individual considerations. Operative therapy is very successful in patients with supraventricular tachycardia associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and should be given high priority as an option in younger patients facing a lifelong commitment to antiarrhythmic drugs.\r"

  ".W": "Many agents, including a number of drugs recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, are now available for the treatment of chronic ventricular arrhythmias. The so-called first-generation agents--quinidine, procainamide and disopyramide--have been used in large numbers of patients for many years, and the safety and efficacy profiles of these drugs are well established. The \"second-generation\" antiarrhythmic agents recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration offer promising new alternatives; however, their safety and efficacy profiles have yet to be confirmed for broad populations over extended periods of time. Although it is recognized that the choice of agent for treatment of a particular patient is a \"therapeutic trial,\" with an unpredictable outcome of efficacy and adverse effects, certain \"descriptors,\" such as patient age or co-existing medical conditions, are often helpful in determining which agent is most likely to be clinically effective, and which agents are most likely to produce adverse effects. When other medical conditions such as hepatic or renal failure are present, the appropriate choice of drug and dosage is required for optimal management of the arrhythmia and for prevention of overdosage, exacerbation of other medical problems and deleterious interactions. Combination therapy with multiple antiarrhythmic agents is often quite effective for increasing arrhythmia control without increasing adverse effects. However dosage modifications are often necessary when an antiarrhythmic drug is given in conjunction with another such agent, or with agents that also have electrophysiologic activity or modify metabolic or elimination functions. The following report is one clinician's approach for optimizing efficacy and minimizing toxicity while using the difficult class of drugs called antiarrhythmic agents. It will encourage the use of certain drugs before others, based on considerations of efficacy, safety, ease of administration, follow-up, and other factors.\r"

In clinical settings, arrhythmias that are easily initiated and terminated with programmed electrical stimulation are often designated as reentry tachycardias. However, proof of reentry is contingent upon demonstration of the entire circuit; this relation has been proposed for arrhythmias associated with large circuits, such as those seen in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Reentry has also been proposed as the mechanism responsible for a variety of other tachycardias, including bundle branch and atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia, permanent junctional reentrant tachycardia, reentry tachycardia associated with nodoventricular Mahaim fibers and inducible atrial and ventricular tachycardia. Documentation of triggered rhythms as the mechanism responsible for clinical arrhythmias has been even more difficult. Examples of arrhythmias resulting from triggered activity may include those associated with digitalis toxicity arising from the atria, the atrioventricular junction or the ventricles. Clinical arrhythmias due to triggered activity in the absence of digitalis have also been described. Cardiac arrhythmias that cannot be induced by electrical stimulation are presumably due to normal or abnormal automaticity. Examples of normal automaticity in the human heart are sinus rhythm and junctional and idioventricular escape rhythms. Tachycardias by abnormal automaticity have seldom been investigated for the purpose of documenting the mechanism and therefore the limited data available make it difficult to draw any final conclusions.\r"

By use of rats and dogs, this effect has been noted in renal ablation, glomerulonephritis, and an experimental type of diabetic renal disease. Although a beneficial effect of dietary phosphate restriction for human renal disease has not been established, the fact that it is effective in multiple types of experimental renal disease in two distinct species suggests that phosphate restriction could be effective in retarding the progression of renal failure in man.\r"

Although considerable experimental data suggest that hypertension is important in progressive nephron damage, recent studies also have indicated that abnormal lipid metabolism may be an independent risk factor in the pathogenesis of FGS. Indeed, the synergistic impact of hypertension and hyperlipidemia in the pathogenesis of FGS may be analogous to the role of these factors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This review focuses on some of the recent and pertinent data that support a role of lipid-mediated glomerular injury in the pathogenesis of progressive renal disease.\r"

Conventional assays based on the Fe-binding properties of this protein are tedious to perform, susceptible to Fe contamination, and require volumes of serum that can only be obtained by venous sampling. We describe in this report a two-site enzyme immunoassay (EIA) developed with the use of monoclonal antibodies. Ten microliters serum is diluted 1:20,000 before assay, reflecting a high degree of sensitivity. The variability of this EIA is comparable to conventional colorimetric assays for total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and excellent correspondence was observed between these methods over a range in TIBC of 150-500 micrograms/dL (27-90 mumol/L). No consistent difference was observed with the EIA when performed on venous and capillary specimens obtained simultaneously. This method will facilitate the evaluation of Fe and protein status in nutritional surveys.\r"

Eight healthy volunteers were given 50 g carbohydrate portions of the above meals after an overnight fast. The glycemic and insulin indices were highest for the Lebanese meal and lowest for the Greek with significant differences among the meals (ANOVA, p less than 0.05). The observed glycemic indices correlated well with the predicted glycemic indices (r = 0.88, p less than 0.01) and insulin responses parallelled the glycemic responses (r = 0.83, p less than 0.05). These results suggest that the glycemic index approach will be useful in planning diets for diabetic people.\r"

  ".U": "88103416\r", 
  ".W": "During 1985 and 1986, the Centers for Disease Control conducted eight surveys to evaluate laboratory performance in testing for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). (Other names for this virus include \"human T-lymphotropic virus type III\" and \"lymphadenopathy associated virus.\") The first survey was conducted with ten samples and 50 laboratories; the remaining surveys used six samples, but enrollment increased to as many as 475 laboratories. The purpose of these surveys was to measure test performance by the laboratories under the actual conditions of use. The surveys contained duplicate samples to permit measurement of within- and between-survey reproducibility. One survey included positive and negative reference materials as evaluation samples. Results of the Western blot (WB) test were not always positive on samples that were positive by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and sometimes they were positive on samples that had negative results by EIA. The percentage of positive results reported by laboratories using Electronucleonics tests was lower than that reported by users of Abbott and of Litton tests. positive results on the negative reference material were reported by 13.7% of the Abbott EIA test users. The tests do not seem to be calibrated against an equivalent standard. Within-survey reproducibility was usually above 95% for EIA and WB methods and for the major manufacturers of EIA tests. Between-survey reproducibility was usually above 90%. Reproducibility was below 75% for some combinations of samples, method, and manufacturer. The test performance observed in these surveys may be lower than is actually achieved on patient samples because the samples were selected to measure technical competence and contain a higher frequency of samples with low reactivity than would be encountered with clinical samples. Stratification and weighting of the results in these surveys to estimate performance parameters for a blood bank population indicate that the tests are performing well in this application. If single EIA tests at the performance levels achieved in these surveys were used (no repeat and no confirmation), about 1 sample with positive results in every 50,000 samples tested would be missed and about 2.5% would be false positive results. Because tests are duplicated and confirmed in blood banks, better performance would be expected. Testing for antibody to HIV virus continues to undergo rapid change because of the introduction of new tests, changes in technical aspects of existing tests, and application of testing to changing populations. Such dynamic factors necessitate an ongoing, comprehensive monitoring of test performance.\r"

T. beigelii could be successfully visualized in tissue sections from all three patients with this infection and a patient with systemic candidiasis who was found to have concomitant infection by T. beigelii. The capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans was also stained, indicating the presence of cross-reactive antigen between T. beigelii and C. neoformans. C. neoformans-absorbed antiserum was reactive with T. beigelii but not with other fungi, including C. neoformans.\r"

In a study of 62 patients with NHL whose karyotypes was determined at diagnosis, 3 patients were found to have a deletion of the long arm of chromosomes 14 at band 22 (del[14][q22]). All had a diffuse lymphoma with generalized lymphadenopathy and bone marrow involvement. All three lymphomas were of B-cell origin, as shown by the presence of surface immunoglobulin and monoclonal antibody phenotyping. For each patient, a trisomy 12 was associated with del(14)(q22) in a clone. These data suggest that del(14)(q22), perhaps in association with trisomy 12, could identify a subtype of NHL and that band 22 of chromosome 14 may be implicated in the B-cell ontogeny.\r"

Specimens were divided between those patients receiving cyclosporine (CyA) and steroid immunotherapy (73 patients) and those receiving standard azathioprine (Aza) and steroid immunotherapy (106 patients). When patients with urinary tract infections were excluded, an increase in leukocyturia was observed in the CyA-treated patients. Ninety-three percent of the CyA-treated patients had at least one specimen with more than 1,000 neutrophils/10 high-power fields (HPFs) versus 62% of the 106 Aza-treated patients. Sixty-four percent of the specimens examined from the CyA-treated group had more than 1,000 neutrophils/10 HPFs compared with only 18% of specimens from Aza-treated patients. It appears that CyA is a cause of sterile leukocyturia in renal allograft recipients. The significance of leukocyturia in CyA nephrotoxicity needs further definition.\r"

A total of 444 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus collected from individual patients over a four-year period were tested by (1) the oxacillin disk diffusion test, with particular attention to the presence of fine growth of a resistant subpopulation within the zone of inhibition (Ox Grow interpretive criteria); (2) the agar screen method using agar plates with 4% NaCl and either 6 mg/L oxacillin or 10 mg/L methicillin; and (3) the oxacillin and methicillin broth microdilution test methods with 2% NaCl supplementation. Overall, 62 (14%) isolates were resistant and 382 (86%) isolates were susceptible to oxacillin with the use of the reference broth microdilution system. The results indicate that the disk diffusion test with the use of the Ox Grow criteria had a high sensitivity (94%) and negative predictive value (98%) but a low specificity (67%) and positive predictive value (32%) when compared with the reference broth dilution test. Similarly, the agar screen tests had a high sensitivity (95-97%) and negative predictive values (99%) but low specificity (64-74%) and positive predictive values (30-37%). These data indicate that the agar screen tests and the oxacillin disk test with the use of the Ox Grow interpretive criteria may be useful as screening tests for detecting resistance to the penicillinase-resistant penicillins but that all resistant isolates should be confirmed by the reference broth dilution method because of the large number of false-resistant screening test results.\r"

Results were correlated with biochemical values determined from dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) assay on tumor tissue obtained subsequently at operation. ERICA had positive results in 32 of 41 DCC-positive cases (sensitivity, 78%) and in 5 of 17 DCC-negative cases (specificity, 71%). The semiquantitative degree of ERICA positivity correlated with the concentration of estrogen receptor by DCC. Results of both assays correlated with the histologic grade of the tumor and patient age. Estrogen receptor can be determined by immunocytochemistry in ABC specimens in a community hospital. However, the sensitivity and specificity of this procedure compared with biochemical assay, and eventual response to hormonal therapy, require further investigation.\r"

Placing air-dried smears in normal saline for 30 seconds before fixation in 95% alcohol is found to be a simple means of rehydrating the cells. The quality of the rehydrated smears is superior or identical to that of the immediately wet-fixed smears, provided that the period of drying does not exceed 30 minutes.\r"

The lesions in this report, which the authors have designated as adenoid cystic-like tumors, occurred in men of 60 and 68 years of age who presented with urinary tract obstruction and had transurethral resection of the prostate. Both neoplasms were associated with a minor component of prostatic adenocarcinoma of the usual acinar type. Each adenoid cystic-like tumor had areas that closely resembled basal cell hyperplasia of the prostate, and one had conspicuous foci of squamous differentiation. One patient had a radical prostatectomy and is well six years after operation. The other patient was treated with transurethral resection and irradiation and is well eight months after operation. The prognosis associated with this neoplasm appears to be excellent on the basis of the limited experience to date.\r"

The 22 spleens obtained in the erythrocytotic phase showed striking congestion with mature erythrocytes but no significant extramedullary hematopoiesis. However, the 20 spleens obtained in the spent phase showed prominent trilinear extramedullary hematopoiesis. Increasing splenomegaly with extramedullary hematopoiesis correlated with the development of increased medullary reticulin and peripheral blood leukoerythroblastosis. Splenic myeloid metaplasia is not a feature of uncomplicated polycythemia vera, and its presence indicates progression to the spent phase, or postpolycythemic myeloid metaplasia. The authors' findings indicate that the presence of hematopoietic precursors in the spleen in the spent phase of polycythemia vera and in agnogenic myeloid metaplasia is a result of their filtration from the peripheral blood.\r"

Eighty-five patients with active ulcerative colitis participated in a prospective open trial to examine the tolerance of the active constituent 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), coated with an acrylic resin, and its efficacy in inducing and subsequently maintaining a remission. Fifty-one of the patients had previously developed adverse reactions to sulfasalazine. After 4 wk of treatment with 3.2 g 5-ASA daily, a remission was achieved in 23 of 36 patients (64%) with mild or moderate disease, but in none of 43 patients with severe disease. Six patients were withdrawn because of side effects to 5-ASA, but only two of these patients had similar reactions on sulfasalazine. Supplementary corticosteroids for 6 wk or less induced a remission in 27 of the patients who had failed on 5-ASA alone. Fifty patients were therefore eligible for the maintenance phase of the trial, and 39 (78%) had a sustained clinical and endoscopic remission upon 1-yr follow-up. 5-ASA appears to be an effective drug for inducing remission in mild or moderate ulcerative colitis and for the maintenance of remission. It thus represents a valuable addition to the management of patients intolerant to sulfasalazine.\r"

The varices were graded 0 to 4+ endoscopically; the diameter of the portal vein, the splenic vein, the hepatic artery, and the maximal length of the spleen were determined on ultrasound. In addition, portal collateral veins and the sudden amputation of portal vein branches in the liver were identified when present. There was a significant correlation of the diameter of the portal vein and the maximal spleen length with the magnitude of varices on endoscopy; there was no significant relationship between the splenic vein or the hepatic artery diameter. Less than half the patients with varices had sonographically demonstrated collaterals or portal vein branch amputation. A sonoscore was derived allotting one point each for enlarged portal vein (greater than 1.3 cm), enlarged spleen, collaterals or two or more amputated veins. The sonoscore correlated better with the endoscopic grade of varices than any other marker. The sonoscore among the patients with varices who bled was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than any of the other measures. It is concluded that real time ultrasound can be used to screen for varices and to identify the need for endoscopy.\r"

We report a case in which relief of jaundice was obtained by percutaneous cyst aspiration. For the elderly, infirm, or high-risk patient, percutaneous aspiration is recommended to relieve obstructive jaundice. Immense size and porta hepatis proximity are major risk factors for developing jaundice from simple hepatic cysts. Abdominal pain of recent onset and rising alkaline phosphatase are warning signs that this complication is developing. In these situations, treatment prior to developing jaundice is recommended.\r"

To begin to address this issue, the infiltrating cells in frozen kidney tissues from two patients with interstitial nephritis secondary to Sjogren's syndrome were characterized by indirect immunofluorescence. T cells predominated, the majority of which were helper/inducer cells (OKT4+). Both kidneys contained nodules of B cells. The increased proportion of OKT4+ T cells in salivary gland and in interstitial renal lesions of Sjogren's syndrome contrasts with some other forms of interstitial renal disease and suggests that the renal and salivary gland lesions have a similar pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The pathophysiology of renal dysfunction in generalized sepsis remains unknown. In this study, 24 hours after surgical induction of peritonitis in 20 volume-loaded sheep, three patterns of renal function were seen. In group 1 (n = 8), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased by 70%, urine volume by 85%, absolute sodium excretion by 95%, and fractional sodium excretion by 83%. Group 2 (n = 4) exhibited similar sodium retention but GFR did not fall. Group 3 (n = 8) showed no change in GFR or urine volume and only minimally reduced sodium excretion. Mean arterial pressure fell 17% in group 1 only; central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and plasma volume were maintained at or above presepsis values in all groups. Cardiac index was either increased or unchanged, and renal plasma flow was maintained in all groups; there was thus no hemodynamic evidence to suggest volume contraction. Histologic examination showed only minor changes with no consistent pattern. Renal functional changes correlated with other manifestations of severe sepsis--GFR and sodium retention correlated significantly with increased cardiac index, decreased systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary arterial hypertension, leukopenia, hypoproteinemia, and hypoglycemia. All of these changes were most marked in group 1. In groups 1 and 2, plasma renin activity (PRA) increased and urinary kallikrein excretion decreased. PRA correlated inversely with GFR, urine volume, and sodium excretion; urinary kallikrein excretion correlated positively with urine volume and sodium excretion. Urinary excretion of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was increased in groups 1 and 2 and correlated inversely with mean arterial pressure in group 1 animals. During sepsis, urinary thromboxane B2 excretion continued at presepsis values in all groups. The results suggest that unusual reciprocal changes in activity of the renin-angiotensin and renal kallikrein-kinin systems may play a role in the renal response to sepsis. PGI2 synthesis is increased and may affect systemic hemodynamics and renal function; the role of thromboxane A2 in this context is unknown.\r"

Imaging modalities that were used to establish a definitive diagnosis of focal bacterial nephritis included ultrasound, computed tomography, and intravenous urography with nephrotomography. Ultrasound was found to be the most effective and least costly method of diagnosis. Misdiagnosis of AFBN as abscess or tumor, which it may stimulate, could lead to inappropriate surgical therapy.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to clarify a participation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the development of hepatic glomerulopathy in adults, kidney specimens obtained from 151 patients with liver diseases were studied. Although mesangial proliferation was more severe in patients with chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis than in those with acute hepatitis, no significant difference was observed between 82 serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive (HBV-related group) and 69 negative patients (HBV-nonrelated group). However, double contours of the glomerular capillary walls were observed more often in the former group (18/82, P less than .01), especially in the HBeAg-positive subgroup (8/24, P less than .001), than in the latter (3/69). In addition, glomerular capillary spike formation or a bubblelike appearance was observed in seven patients of the former group. Of these, all five patients examined were HBeAg-positive in their serum. By electron microscopic studies, subendothelial dense deposits and mesangial interpositions were observed more frequently in the HBV-related group, and subepithelial deposits were found only in the HBeAg-positive subgroup. The immunofluorescence study revealed IgA-dominant mesangial deposition in both HBV-related and nonrelated groups. As for the capillary wall deposits, however, IgG was dominant in 13 of the HBV-related group, but only one of the nonrelated group (P less than .01). Furthermore, one patient in the HBV-related group showed capillary wall-dominant HBeAg combined with IgG deposition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "From August 1983 through August 1986, we used a dipstick culture device for outpatient dialysate cultures among patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The device was used in 42% of 531 peritonitis episodes. In 21% of the peritonitis episodes, patients elected to be hospitalized for treatment and, therefore, did not obtain a dialysate culture. The frequency of noncompliance was 18%. All samples were received within four days of mailing. Forty percent of isolates were gram-positive organisms, 30% were gram-negative, 3% were fungal organisms, and 27% of the cultures failed to yield a growth. Aside from a greater incidence of failure to define a bacterial growth responsible for peritonitis, the spectrum of organisms was similar to culture results obtained from the patients who elected, during this same period, to be hospitalized. We believe the dipstick device may be used effectively for outpatient dialysate cultures.\r"

  ".W": "An association between insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and an RFLP adjacent to the insulin gene has been consistently observed, but its etiological significance is unclear. We studied unrelated IDDM patients (N = 45) and controls (N = 65) to confirm the association--and assessed evidence for linkage in 22 families with at least two affected (IDDM) sibs--to determine whether the insulin-gene region actually contributes to susceptibility to IDDM. All individuals were typed for the RFLP in the 5'-flanking region of the insulin gene (5'FP) used in the previous studies, and the 12 families not fully informative for linkage with the 5'FP were typed for additional closely linked RFLPs. We found a higher frequency of class 1 alleles of the 5'FP in IDDM patients (.83) than in controls (.75), which is consistent with the reported association, but the difference was not statistically significant in our sample. Among the 33 affected sib pairs (ASPs) in 22 families, if maximum possible sharing is assumed when sharing is ambiguous, 10 pairs share both parental insulin genes, 17 pairs share one, and six share neither. This distribution is incompatible with close linkage. In contrast, for the HLA region, for which all 22 families are fully informative, 19 of the 33 ASPs share two haplotypes and the remaining 14 share one. There are no pairs that share neither HLA haplotype. Thus, although these data clearly illustrate the contribution of HLA-linked susceptibility to IDDM, they argue strongly against a contribution of similar magnitude by the insulin-gene region.\r"
