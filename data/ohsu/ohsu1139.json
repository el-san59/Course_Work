Single-sided polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification cloning and quantitative PCR amplification of the TCR chains from the cell line and from fresh IELs demonstrated that IELs were oligoclonal. The IEL T cell line exhibited CD1-specific cytotoxicity and a dominant IEL T cell clone was CD1c-specific. Thus, human jejunal intraepithelial lymphocytes are oligoclonal and recognize members of the CD1 gene family.\r"

Synaptic responses mediated by GABAA receptors also strongly excited hippocampal neurons. This excitatory response was recorded in morphologically identified interneurons in the presence of 4-aminopyridine or after elevation of extracellular potassium concentrations. The synaptic excitation sustained by GABAA receptors synchronized the activity of inhibitory interneurons. This synchronized discharge of interneurons in turn elicited large-amplitude inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in pyramidal and granule cells. Excitatory synaptic responses mediated by GABAA receptors may thus provide a mechanism for the recruitment of GABAergic interneurons through their recurrent connections.\r"

The transcriptional regulatory potential of WT1 has not been demonstrated. In transient transfection assays, the WT1 protein functioned as a repressor of transcription when bound to the EGR-1 site. The repression function was mapped to the glutamine- and proline-rich NH2-terminus of WT1; fusion of this domain to the zinc finger region of EGR-1 converted EGR-1 into a transcriptional repressor.\r"

The channel molecule is a complex of the main, pore-forming subunit alpha 1 and four additional subunits: alpha 2, delta, beta, and gamma (alpha 2 and delta are encoded by a single messenger RNA). The alpha 1 subunit messenger RNA alone directs expression of functional calcium channels in Xenopus oocytes, and coexpression of the alpha 2/delta and beta subunits enhances the amplitude of the current. The alpha 2, delta, and gamma subunits also have pronounced effects on its macroscopic characteristics, such as kinetics, voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and enhancement by a dihydropyridine agonist. In some cases, specific modulatory functions can be assigned to individual subunits, whereas in other cases the different subunits appear to act in concert to modulate the properties of the channel.\r"

There are basic differences in studying purified polymers, highly concentrated but not purified fibers, and diets high in high-fiber whole foods. The fibrils of the plant cell wall are most likely altered when prepared as a pure chemical entity, and when fiber concentrates (eg, wheat bran) are used, the method of preparation may alter the composition of the final product. Whole-plant, high-fiber foods are complex storehouses of a diversity of polymers, including resistant starch, and of bioactive compounds. Furthermore, the addition of a reasonable amount of high-fiber food to the diet not only adds dietary fiber but many digestible, caloric macronutrients that alter the entire diet composition. These problems and dilemmas are reviewed.\r"

Nondiabetic females had significantly less intraabdominal fat (P less than 0.01) than did the diabetics but had equivalent subcutaneous fat. There was no significant relationship between waist-to-hip ratio and intraabdominal fat, subcutaneous fat, or their ratio. After a weight loss of 10.6 +/- 3.8 kg there were significant decreases in both intraabdominal and subcutaneous fat (P less than 0.01). Weight loss is associated with decreases in fat in both depots.\r"

Obese subjects were then divided into subgroups based on age at onset of obesity and past fluctuations in body weight. Obese subjects characterized by large weight fluctuations showed elevated preferences for sugar and fat mixtures compared with the stable subgroup. In contrast, early age at onset of obesity (less than 10 y), thought to be a measure of familial risk, had no significant effects on taste preferences. Environmental as opposed to familial factors may be more immediate determinants of taste preferences and food choice.\r"

The relative risk (RR) of menarche before age 12.5 y was 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-3.8] for the tallest girls (greater than 150 cm) compared with the shortest girls (less than 130 cm). The RR was 2.1 (95% CI = 1.1-3.8) for the fattest girls [Quetelet's index of relative weight (in kg/m2) greater than 19] vs the leanest girls (less than 15). After adjusting for height and Quetelet's index, menarcheal age was not associated with intake of energy nor energy-adjusted intake of protein, fat, or carbohydrate. The overall results are consistent with the hypothesis that nutritional factors influence age at menarche mainly through their effects on accumulation of adipose tissue.\r"

In early pregnancy mothers were generally normal weight to moderately overweight. Their mean energy intake, largely from plant sources, was approximately 8.37 MJ/d (2000 kcal/d) during trimesters 2 and 3. Early (3 mo) pregnancy weight and weight gain during trimesters 2 and 3 were significantly positively related to birth weight Z scores. The best predictor model examined for birth weight included early pregnancy weight, weight gain, and length of gestation (R2 = 0.45). Early pregnancy weight and maternal intake of animal-source foods were significant positive predictors of the newborn's orientation and habituation behavior, respectively. Habituation and orientation measures assess the infant's early ability to process information.\r"

A 6-wk washout period was allowed between diets. Between 6 and 12 wk after the fish + oil diet, erythrocyte EPA and DHA were still declining and it was only after 18 wk that erythrocyte EPA had returned to baseline whereas DHA had not. Investigators examining variables that are influenced by altered membrane fatty acid composition should be aware of these prolonged effects when designing studies. Protracted washout periods (greater than 18 wk) make the classic crossover design prohibitive and a parallel design becomes essential.\r"

To carefully document the hypocholesterolemic effects of OB, 20 hypercholesterolemic men admitted to a metabolic ward were randomly allocated to either OB or wheat bran (WB) for 21 d after a 7-d control-diet period. Control and treatment diets were designed to be identical in energy content and nutrients, differing only in the amount of soluble fiber. After 21 d, OB significantly decreased total cholesterol by 12.8% (P less than 0.001), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol by 12.1% (P less than 0.004), and apolipoprotein B-100 by 13.7% (P less than 0.001) whereas WB had no significant effect. High-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I did not change significantly in either group. Serum triglycerides decreased by 10% in both groups but the decrease was only significant (P less than 0.04) in WB subjects. OB but not WB significantly reduced total cholesterol and other atherogenic lipoprotein fractions independent of other dietary changes.\r"

During the second 10 wk placebo was replaced by 15 g fish-oil concentrate/d. During the last 8 wk 200 mg vitamin E/d was added to fish oil. Compared with placebo, fish-oil feeding significantly increased plasma glucose and decreased triacylglycerol, insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, and somatomedin C. The changes in plasma cholesterol, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) were not significant. Fish oil plus vitamin E further decreased insulin, growth hormone, and DHEA-S and reversed the effect of fish-oil on somatomedin C. The changes in glucose, glucagon, growth hormone, and cortisol were not significant. Thus, changes in plasma glucose and lipids caused by dietary fish oil alone and with fish oil plus vitamin E appear to be due to alterations in hormones involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.\r"

Thus, decreasing the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids should reduce the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation. Therefore, we tested the possibility that diets enriched in oleate might result in LDL that is less susceptible to oxidative modification. LDL isolated from subjects consuming an oleate-enriched diet, compared with LDL from subjects on a linoleate-enriched diet, contained significantly more oleate (28.7% vs 11.5%) and less linoleate (31.9% vs 50.9%). Generation of conjugated dienes was significantly lower in the LDL from the oleate group. Most important, after incubation with endothelial cells, LDL from the oleate group underwent less degradation by macrophages. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of altering the diet in a way that will not raise LDL cholesterol concentrations and yet will decrease the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative modification.\r"

Ascorbic acid was free in plasma and serum of normal, healthy volunteers, 10 men and 10 women. Ascorbic acid was detectable only in its reduced form. However, dehydroascorbic acid could be made to appear in samples processed under oxidizing conditions. Because circulating ascorbic acid is free and is detected only as reduced vitamin, ascorbic acid may be available without intermediates for peripheral utilization.

When subjects consumed their usual diet, there was good agreement between dietary absorption (6.4%) and representative single meals fed in the laboratory (6.1%). Nonheme-iron availability, as estimated by a model that incorporated the effect of both enhancers and inhibitors, correlated significantly with absorption from single meals but not with dietary absorption. When the diet was modified to promote iron absorption maximally, dietary absorption increased only slightly (8.0%) and remained significantly lower than it was from single meals (13.5%). With an inhibitory diet, the decrease in absorption from single meals was similarly exaggerated. These results indicate that in the context of a varied Western diet, nonheme-iron bioavailability is less important than absorption studies with single meals would suggest.\r"

This investigation was undertaken to determine whether this disparity is due to differences in the methods used to measure absorption in the two species. By use of identical methodology and test meals, absorption studies were performed in rats and humans to compare the effect of known dietary enhancers (ascorbic acid and meat) and inhibitors (tea, bran, and soy protein) on nonheme-iron absorption. Meat and tea had a marked effect on absorption in humans but did not influence absorption in rats. Although the effect of ascorbic acid, soy protein, and bran on absorption was statistically significant in rats, the absorptive response was far less than it was in humans. Our studies indicate that rodents cannot be used to assess the quantitative importance of dietary factors in human iron nutrition.\r"

Day-to-day variation in the iron-status measures was similar between men and women except for PF, for which the variation was greater in women. The CVs for a single future determination for Hb, Hct, PF, and PI were 4.6%, 3.0%, 15.2%, and 26.7% for males and 4.4%, 3.2%, 26.8%, and 29.0% for females, respectively. Three to 10 independent measurements are required to accurately determine PF and PI whereas one is adequate for Hb and Hct. Thus, day-to-day biological variation is a major component of the variability in these iron-status indicators and must be considered when assessing iron status.\r"

Suppl 2 decreased plasma triglycerides, further increased the RBC alpha-tocopherol, moderately increased the RBC double-bond index, but decreased the RBC total fatty acid-cholesterol ratio. Zinc, copper, and porphyrins showed prolonged changes. The supplements did not change hemoglobin concentrations, RBC age (reticulocytes, polyamines), or number of aplastic and vasoocclusive crises. Zinc reduces irreversibly sickled cells. Augmentation of RBC antioxidant status by alpha-tocopherol and vitamin C and incorporation of omega 3 fatty acids into RBCs do not affect hemolytic component.

The children came from comparably poor socioeconomic settings in Karachi, Pakistan, except that the literacy rates were higher in mothers of the CG (P = 0.0001). Although greater than 95% of all infants were breast-fed, delayed initiation of breast-feeding was more common in the diarrhea groups. Children with diarrhea were also more likely to receive supplemental milk (PD = 92%, AD = 87%) than were children in the CG (69%, P less than 0.05). Feedings were not withheld during diarrhea but changes were made in the nature of foods given. These results indicate that several feeding practices may be important risk factors for diarrhea in Pakistan.\r"

An important step in the understanding of RP has been the recognition that some cases of autosomal dominant RP (ADRP) are caused by mutations in the rhodopsin gene. Multiple different point mutations within the coding sequence of the rhodopsin gene have been associated with ADRP. We have developed a GC-clamped denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis (DGGE) assay for the coding region of the rhodopsin gene and have used this assay to screen ADRP patients for mutations. The assay consists of amplifying with PCR the five exons of the rhodopsin gene and then analyzing each PCR product by DGGE. We have used this assay to detect three previously unreported rhodopsin base substitutions associated with ADRP. The use of this assay to identify ADRP patients who have various rhodopsin mutations has allowed us to begin studies seeking to correlate molecular genotype with clinical phenotype. Furthermore, GC-clamped DGGE has allowed us to identify families with ADRP not caused by a rhodopsin mutation. Such families will be important in the search for other genes involved in ADRP.\r"

The controls showed both chromosome 17 homologues labeled in 85%-95% of cells, while each patient showed only one homologue labeled in 75%-80% of cells. Two MDS patients with cryptic translocations were also studied. In one case, a patient and her mother had the same der(17) (p+), but the reciprocal product of the translocation could not be identified in the mother by G-banding (i.e., it was a \"half-cryptic\" translocation). FISH revealed a 3q;17p translocation. The other case involved a patient with apparently normal karyotype. Because a large molecular deletion was found, a translocation involving two G-negative telomeres (i.e., a \"full-cryptic\" translocation) was postulated. FISH studies on her father and normal brother showed an 8q;17p translocation. These studies demonstrate that in situ hybridization is an efficient method for deletion detection in Miller-Dieker syndrome. More important, parental studies by FISH on patients demonstrating molecular deletions and a normal karyotype may identify cryptic translocation events, which cannot be detected by other molecular genetic strategies. Similar in situ strategies for deletion detection can be developed for other microdeletion syndromes, such as Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "The genetic defect causing Huntington disease (HD) has been mapped to 4p16.3 by linkage analysis using DNA markers. Two apparently contradictory classes of recombination events in HD kindreds preclude precise targeting of efforts to clone the disease gene. Here, we report a new recombination event that increases support for an internal candidate region of 2.5 Mb between D4S10 and D4S168. Analysis of 23 DNA polymorphisms in 4p16.3 revealed a complex pattern of association with the disease gene that failed to narrow the size of the candidate region. The degree of linkage disequilibrium did not show a continuous increase across the physical map, nor was a region of extreme disequilibrium identified. Markers displaying no association with the disorder were interspersed with and, in many cases, close to markers displaying significant disequilibrium. Comparison of closely spaced marker pairs on normal and HD chromosomes, as well as analysis of haplotypes across the HD region, suggest that simple recombination subsequent to a single original HD mutation cannot easily explain the pool of HD chromosomes seen today. A number of different mechanisms could contribute to the diversity of haplotypes observed on HD chromosomes, but it is likely that there has been more than one and possibly several independent origins of the HD mutation.\r"

Human trimeric and tetrameric short tandem repeats (STRs) were studied for informativeness, frequency, distribution, and suitability for DNA typing and genetic mapping. The STRs were highly polymorphic and inherited stably. A STR-based multiplex PCR for personal identification is described. It features fluorescent detection of amplified products on sequencing gels, specific allele identification, simultaneous detection of independent loci, and internal size standards. Variation in allele frequencies were explored for four U.S. populations. The three STR loci (chromosomes 4, 11, and X) used in the fluorescent multiplex PCR have a combined average individualization potential of 1/500 individuals. STR loci appear common, being found every 300-500 kb on the X chromosome. The combined frequency of polymorphic trimeric and tetrameric STRs could be as high as 1 locus/20 kb. The markers should be useful for genetic mapping, as they are sequence based, and can be multiplexed with the PCR. A method enabling rapid localization of STRs and determination of their flanking DNA sequences was developed, thus simplifying the identification of polymorphic STR loci. The ease by which STRs may be identified, as well as their genetic and physical mapping utility, give them the properties of useful sequence tagged sites (STSs) for the human genome initiative.\r"

  ".W": "The second enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALAD), is a homooctameric protein encoded by a gene localized to human chromosome 9q34. Expression of the two common alleles, ALAD1 (p = .9) and ALAD2 (q = .1), results in a polymorphic enzyme system with three distinct charge isozymes, designated 1-1, 1-2, and 2-2. Individuals heterozygous (2pq = .18) or homozygous (q2 = .01) for the ALAD2 allele have significantly higher blood lead levels than do ALAD1 homozygotes, when exposed to low or high levels of lead in the environment. To investigate the molecular nature of this common polymorphism, total RNA from an ALAD2 homozygote was oligo-dT primed and reverse transcribed, and then the ALAD2 cDNA was amplified, subcloned, and sequenced. Compared with the ALAD1 sequence, the only difference in the ALAD2 cDNA was a G-to-C transversion of nucleotide 177 in the coding region, which created an MspI restriction site. This base substitution predicted the replacement of a positively charged lysine by a neutral asparagine (K59N), an amino acid change consistent with the more electronegative charge of the ALAD-2 subunit. The ALAD1 and ALAD2 alleles were easily detected by amplification of a 916-bp region of genomic DNA and MspI digestion which results in 582- and 511-bp products, respectively. Molecular analysis of 85 ALAD1/ALAD2 heterozygotes and of eight ALAD2 homozygotes revealed no discrepancy between the predicted genotype and the erythrocyte isozyme phenotype, indicating that all the ALAD2 alleles analyzed had the G-to-C transversion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although it has been studied clinically and biochemically for many years, the underlying pathophysiology remains unknown. Genetic linkage analysis provides an alternative strategy for understanding the genetic etiology of this disease. Genetic linkage of a gene for TSC to loci in 9q32-9q34 has been reported but has not been a universal finding, since absence of linkage to 9q loci, as well as linkage to loci on 11q, have also been reported. We present here data on 22 families (21 previously unreported) segregating TSC. Our results strongly support a TSC locus in the 9q32-34 region for approximately one-third of families and provide significant evidence for genetic heterogeneity. Application of newly described highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat marker loci in TSC greatly enhanced the informativeness of our pedigrees and was vital for detecting the heterogeneity. No clear evidence of linkage to chromosome 11q22 markers was found, suggesting that a still unidentified TSC locus elsewhere in the genome may account for the majority of TSC families.\r"

  ".U": "91377740\r", 
  ".W": "Statistical models have been developed to delineate the major-gene and non-major-gene factors accounting for the familial aggregation of complex diseases. The mixed model assumes an underlying liability to the disease, to which a major gene, a multifactorial component, and random environment contribute independently. Affection is defined by a threshold on the liability scale. The regressive logistic models assume that the logarithm of the odds of being affected is a linear function of major genotype, phenotypes of antecedents and other covariates. An equivalence between these two approaches cannot be derived analytically. I propose a formulation of the regressive logistic models on the supposition of an underlying liability model of disease. Relatives are assumed to have correlated liabilities to the disease; affected persons have liabilities exceeding an estimable threshold. Under the assumption that the correlation structure of the relatives' liabilities follows a regressive model, the regression coefficients on antecedents are expressed in terms of the relevant familial correlations. A parsimonious parameterization is a consequence of the assumed liability model, and a one-to-one correspondence with the parameters of the mixed model can be established. The logits, derived under the class A regressive model and under the class D regressive model, can be extended to include a large variety of patterns of family dependence, as well as gene-environment interactions.\r"

Here it is demonstrated that the use of selected samples (i.e., ascertainment of a proband with an extreme score on the quantitative measure) can dramatically increase power, especially when proband selection is performed on the tail of a distribution with an infrequent recessive gene. Depending on gene action and allele frequency, selected samples permit detection of a major locus that accounts for as little as 10%-20% of the phenotypic variation. The judicious use of selected samples can make an appreciable difference in the feasibility of linkage studies for quantitative traits.\r"

Previous ultrastructural studies on the dystrophic (scarring) forms of EB have demonstrated abnormalities in the anchoring fibrils, morphologically distinct structures below the basal lamina at the dermal/epidermal basement membrane zone. Type VII collagen is the major collagenous component of the anchoring fibrils, and it is therefore a candidate gene for mutations in some families with dystrophic forms of EB. In this study, we performed genetic linkage analyses in a large kindred with dominant dystrophic EB. A 1.9-kb type VII collagen cDNA clone was used to identify a PvuII RFLP to follow the inheritance of the gene. This RFLP cosegregated with the EB phenotype in this family, strongly supporting genetic linkage (Z = 5.37; theta = .0). In addition, we assigned the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) to chromosome 3 by hybridization to a panel of human x rodent somatic cell hybrids. These data demonstrate very close genetic linkage between the clinical phenotype in this family and the polymorphism in the type VII collagen gene mapped to chromosome 3. The absence of recombination between EB and the type VII collagen gene locus, as well as the observed abnormalities in the anchoring fibrils, strongly suggest that this collagen gene is the mutant locus in this kindred.\r"

Somatic cell hybridization was used to separate the X chromosome derivative and the chromosome 20 derivative in order to position, with respect to the translocation breakpoint, several DNA loci that are linked to the Lowe syndrome locus (Xq24-q26). DXS10 and DXS53 were found to be distal to the breakpoint, whereas DXS37 and DXS42 were located proximal to it. These studies suggest that the OCRL locus lies in the region between these probes. The translocation chromosome originated from an unaffected male without a visible translocation, indicating that the most likely cause of OCRL in this patient is the de novo translocation that disrupted the OCRL locus.\r"

From our total sample of 125 hemophiliacs and from those reported by others, we identify 95 independent missense mutations, 94 of which occur at amino acids that are evolutionarily conserved in the available mammalian factor IX sequences. The likelihood of a missense mutation causing hemophilia B depends on whether the residue is also conserved in the factor IX-related proteases: factor VII, factor X, and protein C. Most of the possible missense mutations in generically conserved residues (i.e., those conserved in factor IX and in all the related proteases) should cause disease. In contrast, missense mutations in factor IX-specific residues (i.e., those conserved in human, cow, dog, and mouse factor IX but not in the related proteases) are sixfold less likely to cause disease. Missense mutations at nonconserved residues are 33-fold less likely to cause disease. At least three models are compatible with these observations. A comparison of sequence alignments from four and nine species of factor IX and an examination of the missense mutations occurring at CpG residues suggest a model in which most residues fall on opposite ends of a spectrum. In about 40% of residues, virtually any missense mutation in a minority of the residues will cause disease, while virtually no missense mutations will cause disease in most of the remaining residues. Thus, many of the residues in factor IX are spacers; that is, the main chains are presumably necessary to keep other amino acid interactions in register, but the nature of the side chain is unimportant.\r"

In human factor IX, C----T and G----A transitions at the dinucleotide CpG are elevated at least 24-fold relative to other transitions. Can the G + C content be explained solely by this hot spot of mutation? Using our mathematical model, we show that the elevation of mutation at CpG cannot alone lower the G + C content below 45%. To search for other hot spots of mutation that might contribute to the reduction of G + C content, we assessed the relative rates of base substitution in our sample of 160 families with hemophilia B. Seventeen independent single-base substitutions are reported herein for a total of 96 independent point mutations in our sample. The following conclusions emerge from the analysis of our data and, where appropriate, the data of others: (1) Transversions at CpG are elevated an estimated 7.7-fold relative to other transversions. (2) The mutation rates at non-CpG dinucleotides are remarkably uniform; none of the observed rates are either more than twofold above the median for transitions or more than threefold above the median for transversions. (3) The pattern of recent mutation is compatible with the pattern during mammalian evolution that has maintained the G + C content of the factor IX gene at approximately 40%.\r"

The molecular basis of this disorder is at present not well understood. We report here two missense mutations which result in low or undetectable enzymatic activity. First, we identified at nucleotide 591 a transition which substitutes glutamine 188 by arginine. The mutated glutamine is not only highly conserved in evolution (conserved also in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), but is also two amino acid residues downstream from the active site histidine-proline-histidine triad and results in about 10% of normal enzymatic activity. The arginine 188 mutation is the most common galactosemia mutation characterized to date. It accounts for one-fourth of the galactosemia alleles studied. Second, we report the substitution of arginine 333 by tryptophan, caused by a transition at nucleotide 1025. The area surrounding this missense mutation is the most highly conserved domain in the homologous enzymes from E. coli, yeast, and humans, and this mutation results in undetectable enzymatic activity, suggesting that this is a severe mutation. This second mutation appears to be rare, since it was found only in the patient we sequenced. Our data provide further evidence for the heterogeneity of galactosemia at the molecular level, heterogeneity which might be related to the variable clinical outcome observed in this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The HeLa cell (a cervical carcinoma cell line) tumor-suppressor gene has been localized to the long arm of chromosome 11 by molecular genetic studies of nontumorigenic and tumorigenic hybrids derived from normal chromosome 11 x HeLa cell fusions. In the present study, 33 primary cervical carcinoma samples were analyzed using chromosome 11-specific polymorphic DNA markers. The RFLP analysis indicated a somatic loss of chromosome 11 heterozygosity in 10 (30%) of the primary tumors. Preferential loss of the long arm of the chromosome was observed in two of the primary tumors. In addition, at least eight-fold amplification of sequences in the q13 region, including those coding for the fibroblast growth factor-related gene (int-2), was observed in one of the primary tumors. These results suggest a possible role for gene(s) localized to chromosome 11, possibly that localized to the long arm in the development and/or progression of cervical carcinomas.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified a previously unrecognized missense mutation in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID). The mutation is a G646-to-A transition at a CG dinucleotide and predicts a glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 216. Computer analysis of secondary structure predicts a major alteration with loss of a beta-pleated sheet in a highly conserved region of the protein. The basepair substitution also generates a new site for the restriction enzyme BstXI in exon 7 of the genomic DNA. Digestion of genomic DNA from the patient and from his parents revealed that he was homozygous for the mutation and that his mother and father were carriers. This mutation in homozygous form appears to be associated with very severe disease, since the patient had perinatal onset of clinical manifestations of SCID, the highest concentration of the toxic metabolite deoxyATP in nine patients studied, and a relatively poor immunologic response during the initial 2 years of therapy with polyethylene glycol-adenosine deaminase. Analysis of DNA from 21 additional patients with ADA-SCID and from 19 unrelated normals revealed that, while none of the normal individuals showed the abnormal restriction fragment, two of the 21 patients studied were heterozygous for the G646-to-A mutation.\r"

  ".W": "The GM2-gangliosidosis B1 variant occurs at an exceptionally high frequency in the northern part of Portugal. In most patients, the disease manifests itself as a juvenile form, as opposed to the late-infantile form described for many patients from other parts of the world. We have analyzed the beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene in 11 patients, as well as in some relatives, in order to characterize the underlying abnormalities. They were screened for the two previously identified mutations responsible for the B1 variant phenotype (G533----A, also designated as the \"DN allele,\" and C532---T) by PCR amplification of an 800-bp DNA fragment and subsequent dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides. The fragment amplified from one patient was also subcloned and sequenced. Ten patients, constituting a clinically and biochemically homogeneous group, were found to be homozygous for the DN allele. The other, whose clinical profile more resembled the late-infantile phenotype often described in the literature, was a compound heterozygote carrying the DN allele and another, as yet unidentified, abnormal allele. Our results, corroborated by previously published data, suggest that homozygotes and compound heterozygotes for the DN allele may be distinguishable at the phenotypic level, depending on the nature of the abnormality in the other allele. A common ancestral origin for the DN allele can also be postulated.\r"

The differential diagnosis of a right-sided transudative pleural effusion in a patient with chronic liver disease with or without ascites includes congestive left ventricular failure and nephrotic syndrome. These diseases are usually ruled out with standard clinical tests. Patients with hepatic hydrothorax should be treated with fluid restriction and diuretics.

The program's purpose is to give minority medical students positive exposure to primary care and attract them back for residency training. In this four-week elective, students participate in seminars with our primary care residents, see patients in a variety of clinics, and complete a project. Key implementation issues include support of the medicine chairman and dean, funding, and malpractice coverage for the students. Program evaluation from the first two students rated the clinic experiences higher than the seminar sessions and the independent project. Both students stated our fellowship made them more likely to train at this medical center should they enter a primary care program. Implications for other programs are listed.\r"

This study evaluated the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) or combined potassium bicarbonate-calcium carbonate supplementation on urinary mineral excretion during the ketoacidosis of a very-low-energy protein diet. Seventeen healthy obese subjects (BMI: 37.5 +/- 3.2 kg/m2, weight: 100 +/- 3 kg) were given a 1.72 MJ all protein (93 g) liquid formula and a multivitamin-mineral supplement daily for 3 weeks. Subjects in groups 1 (n = 6) and 2 (n = 5) received 16 mmol KCl. In addition, subjects in group 1 received 60 mmol Na+ daily as sodium chloride, subjects in group 2, 60 mmol Na+ as NaHCO3. The subjects in group 3 (n = 6) were given 32 mmol K+ as bicarbonate and 16 mmol Ca++ as carbonate daily. Metabolic acidosis was prevented in groups 2 and 3 with bicarbonate and bicarbonate-carbonate administration. This was reflected in significant curtailment of the augmented ammonium nitrogen excretion found in group 1. The additional oral K+ in group 3 improved K+ balance and probably also inhibited ammoniagenesis. Urine calcium was greater (p less than 0.04) in group 1 subjects, but similar in groups 2 and 3, despite higher calcium intake in group 3. Urinary phosphorus decreased with time in all groups, but more so in the group 2 subjects who received NaHCO3. Acidosis was associated with the reverse effect on urinary magnesium, which decreased in group 1 subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forty female hairless guinea pigs were divided into four equal groups: Group 1 (controls); Group 2 (40 J[Joules]/cm2/day); Group 3 (80 J/cm2); and Group 4 (160 J/cm2). Preoperatively, the experimental groups were irradiated on alternate days for 16 weeks. Serial dorsal punch biopsies (4 mm) were taken prior to the initial exposure and subsequently at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks and examined histologically and microscopically. Then, standard 6 cm midline dorsal surgical wounds were made and allowed to heal for 21 days. Wounds were excised and wound tensile strength was assessed. Significant decreases (p less than .05) were noted in wound tensile strength of Groups 2, 3, and 4 compared to the controls, with the decrease being directly related to the dose received. Dermal changes were noted in all irradiated groups as early as four weeks after initial UVA/B exposure. Electron microscopy revealed elastosis and disruption of collagen fibers. Prolonged exposure to radiation, predominantly in the UVA range, appears to impede wound healing in a dose-related fashion and elicits elastosis and collagen disruption.\r"

In another 12 dogs, an additional electrode was positioned in the RVA. A cutaneous patch (P) was placed at the cardiac apex.

  ".W": "Individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) frequently show symptoms of a hyperadrenergic state. beta adrenergic receptor characteristics were compared in the lymphocytes of subjects with symptomatic MVP and control subjects during rest and exercise. At rest, the proportion of receptors binding agonist with high affinity, as determined from isoproterenol competition for (-)[125I]-iodopindolol binding sites, was greater in MVP subjects than in controls. With exercise, the proportion of high-affinity receptors in MVP subjects decreased to control levels. Isoproterenol stimulation of lymphocyte 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) also was greater in MVP subjects than in controls at rest, but not during exercise. Plasma catecholamine concentrations in MVP subjects were normal during both rest and exercise. Unlike exercise, isoproterenol infusion elicited clinical manifestations of increased adrenergic responsiveness in MVP subjects. The beta receptor in exercised MVP subjects exhibited unusually high affinity agonist binding (i.e. a lower dissociation constant KH than in either the same subjects at rest or exercised controls) and also abnormal coupling to the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (GS) of adenylate cyclase, as reflected by the inability of guanine nucleotide to convert the receptor to a low-affinity state. These findings suggest that functional alteration of the beta adrenergic receptor, in the absence of abnormal plasma catecholamine levels, might contribute to the hyperadrenergic state of MVP subjects at rest. However, desensitization of high affinity beta receptors or altered receptor-GS coupling might preserve normal adrenergic responsiveness during exercise.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: Phencyclidine (PCP, \"angel dust\") induces a psychotomimetic state that closely resembles schizophrenia. As opposed to amphetamine-induced psychosis, PCP-induced psychosis incorporates both positive (e.g., hallucinations, paranoia) and negative (e.g., emotional withdrawal, motor retardation) schizophrenic symptoms. PCP-induced psychosis also uniquely incorporates the formal thought disorder and neuropsychological deficits associated with schizophrenia. The purpose of the present paper is to review recent advances in the study of the molecular mechanisms of PCP action and to describe their implications for the understanding of schizophrenic pathophysiology. METHOD: Twenty-five papers were identified that described the clinical dose and serum and CSF levels at which PCP induces its psychotomimetic effects. The dose range of PCP-induced effects were compared to the dose range at which PCP interacts with specific molecular targets and affects neurotransmission. RESULTS: It was found that PCP-induced psychotomimetic effects are associated with submicromolar serum concentrations of PCP. At these concentrations PCP interacts selectively with a specific binding site (PCP receptor) that is associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type excitatory amino acid receptor. Occupation of its receptor by PCP induces noncompetitive inhibition of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission. Other NMDA antagonists such as the dissociative anesthetic ketamine induce PCP-like neurobehavioral effects in proportion to their potency in binding to the PCP receptor and inducing NMDA receptor inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that endogenous dysfunction of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission might contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The relative implications of the PCP and amphetamine models of schizophrenia are discussed in relationship to the diagnosis and etiology of schizophrenia.\r"

In some instances new hypotheses about the nature of stuttering have followed the chance discovery of agents having some efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have used adequate experimental designs. Promising avenues of research, both for the treatment of stuttering and for exploring its nature, include the use of calcium channel blocking agents and cholinergic drugs.\r"

METHOD: At admission, nurses and physicians independently rated the probability that each of 149 psychiatric patients would physically attack someone during the first week of hospitalization on a university-based locked inpatient unit. Ward behavior was measured with the Overt Aggression Scale. RESULTS: There was a moderate level of agreement between nurses' and physicians' assessments of risk. Ratings of ward behavior showed an increase in the proportion of assaultive patients as the level of estimated risk of violence increased. Although the overall rate of assaults was overpredicted, there was a close correspondence between clinical estimates of patients' chances of becoming violent and the proportion of patients within each risk level who later displayed some type of inpatient aggression. CONCLUSIONS: The reliability and validity of short-term estimates of the risk of violence among acutely disturbed inpatients may be higher than past violence research has suggested. These findings provide preliminary support for the utility of a probabilistic approach to assessment of the risk of violence.\r"

METHOD: They evaluated the presence or absence of parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, and akathisia in 104 children and adolescents who were in residence in or admitted over a 6-month period to a state-operated child psychiatric center. They applied a standardized, structured assessment procedure used in research on adult and geriatric psychiatric patients and the mentally retarded. RESULTS: The prevalence of parkinsonism among the 61 subjects at risk was 34% and was significantly associated with longer neuroleptic treatment periods immediately before evaluation. The prevalence of treatment-emergent tardive dyskinesia among the 41 subjects at risk was 12% and showed no association with quantitative neuroleptic treatment variables. However, patients with tardive dyskinesia were significantly more likely to have a family history of mental illness and significantly less likely to have a history of assaultive behavior. A pattern of complex pharmacological responses for parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia, some of which are not typical of those most commonly reported in adults, was seen in this group of young patients. CONCLUSIONS: The study data highlight the acute sensitivity of the neuroleptic-treated child and adolescent to the development of parkinsonism, the possible role of certain patient characteristics in the vulnerability to develop tardive dyskinesia, and the possibility that neuroleptic-induced side effects experienced by children and adolescents differ in some ways from those experienced by adults. The data further strongly support the need for systematic monitoring of neuroleptic-treated child and adolescent patients for a full range of side effects.\r"

The authors sought to answer the question, Does body temperature change with affective state? METHOD: The core body temperature and motor activity patterns of 10 women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), six of whom also met criteria for LLPDD, and no other psychological or medical illness were compared to those of six women with chronic, noncyclic dysphoria and six asymptomatic comparison women at four phases of the menstrual cycle. RESULTS: The nocturnal temperatures of the women with PMS/LLPDD were significantly higher than those of the comparison subjects across the entire menstrual cycle, but there were no differences in nocturnal activity levels. The women with noncyclic dysphoria had a mean nocturnal temperature in the follicular phase as high as that of the women with PMS/LLPDD. The temperatures of all women were higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in the future investigators should document menstrual cycle phase in all female subjects and, when studying body temperature, should carefully monitor symptomatic state in comparison subjects.\r"

METHOD: Patients who met criteria for major depression on the basis of a structured diagnostic interview and who scored 17 or more on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were evaluated with the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale. The patients were then treated in a nonrandom manner with either tricyclic antidepressants or ECT (followed by tricyclic maintenance therapy). The majority of the patients treated with ECT had not responded previously to tricyclics. Follow-up psychometric testing was repeated in 6 months. RESULTS: Among the patients with normal pretreatment cognitive functioning, cognition was generally stable. Among the patients with pretreatment cognitive impairment, a substantial number--including those receiving ECT--demonstrated improvement in cognition. While the majority of patients improved with respect to both their affective and cognitive states, certain treatment-refractory subgroups were nevertheless identified. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that cognitive dysfunction associated with depression may improve after treatment in a substantial number of elderly patients, including those receiving ECT. Relapse rates, however, may be relatively high, and residual symptoms may persist, which emphasizes the need for optimal initial and long-term antidepressant strategies for this population.\r"

METHOD: Using a visual analogue scale, they compared variation of mood in a group of patients (N = 9) with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of depressive disorder and in a group of nondepressed subjects (N = 9) over 12 consecutive hours. To quantify mood variation for each subject, the authors computed the standard deviation of each subject's 13 mood ratings on the visual analogue scale. To characterize the quality of mood variation within each subject, they plotted each subject's mood ratings as a function of time and applied complex demodulation to confirm cyclical patterns of mood variability (ultradian cycles). RESULTS: The depressed group demonstrated greater mood score variability over the course of the day. Both groups demonstrated ultradian cycles and circadian trends; however, the depressed group demonstrated ultradian cycles of significantly greater amplitude than the nondepressed group. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated assessments of mood at different times of the day may be necessary to obtain an accurate impression of a patient's mood state. Further, the mechanism of depressive disorders may include a deregulation of a normal oscillatory mood variation pattern.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the frequency of depressive syndromes during the first 13 months after the death of a spouse. METHOD: Men and women whose spouses had recently died were identified through death certificate records. These subjects completed a multidimensional questionnaire and were interviewed 7-8 weeks (2 months) after the death. Follow-up questionnaires were completed 7 and 13 months after the death. The questionnaires contained specific items corresponding to DSM-III-R criteria for depressive episodes as well as other widely used measures of depressive symptoms such as the Zung Depression Scale and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. RESULTS: Eighty-four (24%) of 350 widows and widowers met criteria for depressive episodes at 2 months, 72 (23%) of 308 did so at 7 months, and 46 (16%) of 286 did so at 13 months. At each time period, the prevalence was substantially higher than the 4% rate of depressive episodes observed in a comparison group of 126 subjects whose spouses were still living. Widows and widowers most likely to meet criteria for depressive episodes 13 months after the bereavement were younger, had past histories of major depression, were still grieving 2 months after the loss, and met DSM-III-R criteria for depressive episodes 2 and/or 7 months after the death. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive episodes are common after the death of a spouse. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for the possibility of depression, particularly in young widows and widowers who have a past history of depression or who experience a full depressive syndrome soon after the loss.\r"

In particular, the analysis determined demographic and clinical risk factors for the recurrence of major depressive disorder. METHOD: Relatives, comparison subjects (matched to relatives for age and sex), and spouses of affectively ill probands underwent structured clinical assessments before and after a 6-year interval. RESULTS: Of 396 individuals who had had only major depressive disorder that ended before the initial evaluation, 33.8% (N = 134) developed a new episode during the 6-year follow-up period. Youth, but not sex, was an important demographic risk factor. The presence of minor depression at the time of initial evaluation and the number of symptoms recalled from the worst previous episode were additional clinical risk factors. At the initial evaluation, 200 other subjects had described a previous history of both major depressive disorder and a nonaffective mental disorder. When compared to the subjects who recalled only a history of major depressive disorder, these subjects were more likely to have been in an episode of chronic intermittent depression at the initial evaluation and to recall a greater number of episodes as well as a greater number of symptoms in the worst episode. A history of a nonaffective mental disorder significantly increased the risk of relapse into major depressive disorder. CONCLUSIONS: These findings agree well with a recent review of clinically based follow-up studies. Thus, youth and a history of nonaffective illness are important risk factors for the recurrence of major affective disorder in a broad variety of settings.\r"

METHOD: The authors conducted a prospective follow-up study of 101 schizoaffective, schizophrenic, bipolar manic, and depressed patients assessed at three times: during hospitalization and 2 and 4-5 years later. The follow-up test battery involved detailed assessment of social functioning, work performance, symptoms, posthospital treatment, and rehospitalization. RESULTS: Outcome for schizoaffective patients 4-5 years after hospitalization differed significantly from that for patients with unipolar depression. However, the differences between schizoaffective and bipolar manic patients were more equivocal. Unlike the patients with bipolar disorder, only a limited number of patients with schizoaffective disorder showed complete recovery in all areas throughout the year preceding the 2-year follow-up and the year preceding the 4- to 5-year follow-up. The differences in outcome between schizoaffective and schizophrenic patients were also mixed. These two groups showed some similarities in outcome, but there were fewer schizoaffective than schizophrenic patients with uniformly poor outcome in all areas. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, schizoaffective patients showed some similarities to both schizophrenic and bipolar manic patients. Schizoaffective patients had somewhat better overall posthospital functioning than patients with schizophrenia, somewhat poorer functioning than bipolar manic patients, and significantly poorer functioning than patients with unipolar depression. The data suggest that when mood-incongruent, schizophrenic-like psychotic symptoms are present in the acute phase, they predict considerable difficulty in outcome, even when affective syndromes are also present, as in schizoaffective disorder. It is likely that schizoaffective disorder is not just a simple variety of affective disorder.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: This study examines the comorbidity of DSM-III-R borderline personality disorder and the other axis II personality disorders. The extent and direction of overlap provides a measure of the clarity of its diagnostic boundaries and descriptive validity. METHOD: In 110 outpatients without concurrent major axis I conditions, axis II diagnoses were assessed in semistructured format and all DSM-III-R personality disorder criteria were rated. Multiple diagnoses were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (20%) met criteria for borderline personality disorder; 18 (82%) had at least one additional personality disorder diagnosis. Using measures of frequencies and intercorrelation coefficients, the authors found that overlap was extensive and not confined to any one of the three designated axis II clusters. Factor analysis revealed 1) a group containing borderline personality disorder with paranoid, histrionic, narcissistic, antisocial, and passive-aggressive personality disorders and 2) another grouping of schizoid, schizotypal, avoidant, obsessive-compulsive, and self-defeating personality disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Borderline personality disorder appears to constitute a broad, heterogeneous category with unclear boundaries that embraces a general personality disorder concept. Both further refinement of the borderline personality disorder construct and investigation into alternative models to the DSM-III-R axis II classification system are suggested.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: This study tested the hypothesis that the risk for affective and impulsive personality disorder traits commonly found in patients with borderline personality disorder would be greater in the first-degree relatives of probands with borderline personality disorder than in two comparison groups. METHOD: Blind family history interviews were conducted with family informants to assess the extent to which first-degree relatives of 29 probands with borderline personality disorder, 22 probands with other personality disorders who met three or fewer of the criteria for borderline personality disorder, and 43 probands with schizophrenia fulfilled operationalized criteria for the two kinds of personality disorder traits and for other diagnostic categories. The crude proportions of adult relatives with each diagnosis, as well as the age-adjusted morbid risks, were assessed in the three groups of relatives. RESULTS: The risks for affective and impulsive personality disorder traits were independently greater in the 129 relatives of the borderline probands than in the 105 relatives of the probands with other personality disorders and the 218 relatives of the schizophrenic probands. There was no similarly greater risk for any other psychiatric disorder assessed, including major affective disorder. In addition, the relatives of borderline probands with current or past major depressive disorder showed a greater risk for major affective disorders than the relatives of never-depressed probands with other personality disorders but not the relatives of never-depressed borderline probands. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest familial transmission of the hallmark borderline-related personality characteristics and raise the possibility that these familial traits may be partially independent.\r"

The observations contained in this paper are drawn from his personal experiences as a practicing psychiatrist in East Germany who also served as a member of the Executive Committee of the World Psychiatric Association from 1984 to 1989. The practice of psychiatry in Eastern Europe before the recent social and political changes was highly variable depending on the country, the locale of practice, and the social and political positions of the involved psychiatrists. Adapting to the recent changes will be very difficult, and it will be a long time before the modernization of psychiatric practice in Eastern Europe takes place. Psychiatrists in the Western world can play an important part in the future development of psychiatry in Eastern Europe. Their understanding of the current situation and the historical forces that shaped it is extremely important to the psychiatrists of Eastern Europe.\r"

Arthrofibrosis prevents the patient from regaining full range of motion, particularly the terminal 5 degrees of full extension, postoperatively. We did a retrospective study of 169 acute ACL reconstructions in a population of young athletes (average age, 22 years). We sought to determine the optimal time to perform acute ACL reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis and the effects of an accelerated versus conventional rehabilitation program. The short-term results were evaluated by range of motion measurements and 13 week Cybex scores. Patients whose ligaments were reconstructed within the 1st week after injury (Group I) had a statistically significant (P less than 0.05) increased incidence of arthrofibrosis (limited extension, scar tissue) over patients who had ACL reconstruction delayed 21 days or more (Group III). At 13 weeks after the reconstruction procedure, Group III patients scored an average of 70% (compared to 51% for Group I, P less than 0.05) on the Cybex evaluation. They also showed a trend toward more flexion of the knee as well as near full extension. Patients who had an ACL reconstruction between 8 and 21 days after injury (Group II) had a similar incidence of arthrofibrosis as Group I when they followed a conventional rehabilitation program postoperatively. However, only a small number of cases (approximately 4%) of Group II patients who followed an accelerated postoperative rehabilitation program had any arthrofibrosis--an observation we also made in the Group III patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Medical collateral ligament and anterior cruciate ligament peak forces, medial collateral ligament and anterior cruciate ligament tension initiation times, and impact safety factors were calculated for both braced and unbraced conditions. These tests were conducted to determine whether or not application of a prophylactic brace might provide protection to the anterior cruciate ligament under valgus loading conditions. The results of this study indicate that those braces that increased impact duration appear to differentially protect the anterior cruciate ligament more than the medial collateral ligament, and that most of the braces tested appear to provide some degree of protection to the anterior cruciate ligament under direct lateral impacts. These findings should be confirmed clinically.\r"

During 1988 and 1989, 32 patients underwent a modified Bankart reconstruction for recurrent anterior glenohumeral instability at two centers as part of a prospective study of this modified technique. There were no complications as a result of the technique. The four surgeons involved agreed that the suture anchor simplified the procedure. Seventeen patients have been reviewed, with more than 1 year followup. Ninety-four percent had good to excellent results according to the Bankart rating scale.

In one group, the medial collateral ligament of the left hindlimb was transected and allowed to heal with cage activity for either 6 or 12 weeks. In another group, the transected ligaments were permitted to heal for 4 weeks and then were placed under increased stress by inserting a stainless steel pin perpendicularly underneath the healing medial collateral ligament. The animals were allowed cage activity for an additional 2 or 8 weeks. The varus-valgus joint laxity and the stress-strain properties of the medical collateral ligament substance were obtained. Further, the quantity of total collagen, amount and ratio of the collagen cross-links, dihydroxylysinonorleucine and hydroxylysinonorleucine, and the histologic appearance of the healing medical collateral ligaments were evaluated for all groups. At 6 weeks, knees with a transected medial collateral ligament were twice as lax as the controls. However, joints with the stainless steel tension pin had varus-valgus values approximately 1.5 times those of the controls. At 12 weeks, joints with increased stress were not statistically different from the controls. The group that had healing with increased stress for 12 weeks produced the highest stress for a given strain compared to any other group. Also, the total collagen levels and the ratio of dihydroxylysinonorleucine/hydroxylysinonorleucine were the closest to normal of any transected group. Finally, qualitative histologic improvements were seen, including a more longitudinal arrangement of collagen fibers and decreased cellularity.\r"

This report analyzes the biomechanical, clinical, and roentgenographic features of 55 such fractures obtained from the National Football Head and Neck Injury Registry. Teardrop fractures resulting from tackle football characteristically occurred in players attempting to make a tackle in which initial contact was made with the top or crown of the helmet. There were two fracture patterns associated with the anteroinferior corner (teardrop) fracture fragment: 1) the isolated fracture, which is usually not associated with permanent neurologic sequelae; and 2) the three-part, two-plane fracture in which there is an associated sagittal vertebral body fracture as well as fracture of the posterior neural arch. This latter pattern was almost always associated with permanent neurologic sequelae, specifically quadriplegia. Axial loading of the cervical spine was clearly identified as a mechanism of injury for both fracture patterns. Roentgenographic examination must include both anteroposterior and lateral views with computed tomography or tomography as necessary to determine the presence of the sagittal vertebral body fracture and the integrity of the posterior neural arch.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary edema secondary to postextubation laryngospasm is a potentially life-threatening problem, demanding early diagnosis and prompt treatment. We believe that this problem has been grossly underestimated in its incidence, as only seven adults have been reported in the English literature, whereas seven adults have been observed at our institution in only a 24 month period. All were young, healthy, athletic adult males (average weight, 218 pounds) who underwent relatively minor, uncomplicated surgical procedures under general anesthesia. Five of these patients were collegiate and/or professional athletes and had meticulous medical records detailing their clinical course. Clinical laryngospasm was noted immediately following extubation and anesthesia by mask with subsequent pulmonary edema. The diagnoses were confirmed by clinical examination, arterial blood gas determinations or pulse oximetry, and chest roentgenogram. Four adults required reintubation. Six of the seven adults demonstrated very rapid resolution of the pulmonary edema with prompt diagnosis and institution of a therapeutic regimen including oxygen, diuretics, reintubation, and/or positive pressure ventilation. In one patient, the problem was not immediately recognized, and progressed to florid pulmonary edema requiring emergent intubation 14 hours later in the emergency room, and 3 days of mechanical ventilation. The etiology of pulmonary edema following upper airway obstruction represents an interplay between several factors: cardiogenic and neurogenic mechanisms, as well as hypoxia contribute. In this group, excessive negative intrathoracic pressure generated by forced inspiration against a closed glottis is the most likely, consistent, and logical explanation. This study suggests that young, healthy, athletic males may be at increased risk for this complication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence of injury during games was 24/1000 hours, while the incidence during training was 7/1000 hours. The majority (88%) of injuries were localized to the lower extremities, with equal occurrence in the left and right legs. Forty-nine percent of the injuries occurred in the knee or ankle. Most of the injuries were minor (49%), while 36% were moderate and 15% were major. Of the major injuries (N = 12), 10 were due to trauma and 7 (58%) were knee ligament or meniscal tears. Overuse injuries constituted 28% of all injuries and occurred mainly during preseason training and at the beginning and end of the competitive season. Traumatic injuries (72%) occurred mainly during games with a predominance at the beginning of the competitive season. Almost 80% of the traumatic injuries occurred during physical contact with an opponent. Extrinsic factors such as weather, playing surface, temperature, or the position of the player within the team did not influence the injury rate. We conclude that female elite soccer players sustain a high incidence of injury. Few injuries were major, but 17% of the players sustained a major knee injury during the year.\r"

There is concern that these devices may induce undesired anterior translation of the tibia and resulting graft stretching or rupture. This study measured the amount of anterior tibial translation that occurred during one cycle in 10 different brands of continuous passive motion devices. Five patients with ACL deficient knees participated in this study. Anterior translation was recorded by using an electrogoniometer with four degrees of freedom (Knee Signature System). Anterior translation measurements were also recorded for a 20 pound Lachman test in these same five patients using the Knee Signature System. Two of the devices showed anterior translation measurements that approached the recorded 20 pound Lachman values. These two devices had a high calf bar for the primary support of the leg. The results indicate that, when using a continuous passive motion device for early postoperative management of the reconstructed ACL in a patient, use of a calf-supporting type of continuous passive motion could induce an undesired strain of the healing graft.\r"

We used 6 cadaveric knees to measure changes in distance of 15 combinations during a simple flexion and extension knee motion. The distance became longer with flexion in each pair of attachment locations. Although the smallest change in distance was obtained between the posterolateral site of the femoral distal metaphysis and a point posterior to the Gerdy tubercle (percent average of the maximum strain was about 12%), it was concluded that the extraarticular ACL reconstruction is not recommended from a standpoint of isometry of the substitute.\r"

  ".U": "91377906\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to assess the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging in determining the presence of articular cartilage injuries of the knee with arthroscopy as the standard for comparison. Forty-nine articular cartilage lesions were documented in 28 knees (27 patients) by arthroscopy. There were 22 men and 5 women with an average age of 29 years. Multiplanar magnetic resonance imaging was performed with spin echo and gradient-refocused acquisition in a steady state pulse technique. All of the knees had magnetic resonance imaging done within 4 weeks prior to arthroscopy. The magnetic resonance images were interpreted before arthroscopy and interpreted again after the results of arthroscopy were known to better define the potential learning curve for evaluating chondral lesions and to identify the technical limits of the existing imaging protocol/software. For full-thickness articular cartilage lesions, the prearthroscopy sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging was 41% (12/29) and the postarthroscopy sensitivity was 83% (24/29). For partial-thickness chondral injury, the prearthroscopy sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging was 15% (3/20) and the postarthroscopy sensitivity was 55% (11/20). The presence of an intraarticular effusion assisted the detection of chondral lesions because of an \"arthrogram\" effect. As a noninvasive method of evaluating articular cartilage and despite experienced interpretation and the benefit of retrospective analysis, both the prearthroscopy and the postarthroscopy sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging was low using the imaging parameters described. Injury to articular cartilage is a frequent cause of knee pain and knee surgery; it is important to note at this time that magnetic resonance imaging cannot reliably exclude the presence of an articular cartilage injury.\r"

It is found mainly in athletes and is caused either by microruptures or partial macroruptures of the proximal part of the ligament. The abnormal anatomical lesion is focal degeneration, microruptures and macroruptures, and devitalized tissue at the insertion of the patellar ligament. Proliferation and neovascularization are often found, as well as degeneration and incomplete tissue healing. Surgical treatment is indicated only if a prolonged and well-supervised conservative treatment program fails. We operated on 78 patients with jumper's knee, by carefully removing the abnormal tissue from the ligament. At follow-up examination, 71 of 78 patients had excellent or good functional results and complete resumption of sports activities. Objective measurements of thigh muscle strength using a Cybex II dynamometer correlated with the functional results at a low angular velocity.\r"

Three hundred forty-seven (69.4%) responded (males, 71%; females, 29%). The mean age of the respondents was 36 years (range, 15 to 61). The average distance run per week was 39.6 miles (range, 5 to 98). The mean duration for use of the orthotic inserts was 23 months (range, 1 to 96). The predominant (63%) type of orthotic device used was flexible. The presumed diagnoses in the population studied were excessive pronation (31.1%), leg length discrepancy (13.5%), patellofemoral disorders (12.6%), plantar fasciitis (20.7%), Achilles tendinitis (18.5%), shin splints (7.2%), and miscellaneous (4.9%). Of the runners responding, 262 (75.5%) reported complete resolution or great improvement of their symptoms. Results of treatment with orthotic shoe inserts were independent of the diagnosis or the runner's level of participation. A high degree of overall satisfaction was demonstrated by the finding that 90% of the runners continued to use the orthotic devices even after resolution of their symptoms. Orthotic shoe inserts were most effective in the treatment of symptoms arising from biomechanical abnormalities, such as excessive pronation or leg length discrepancy. Along with other conservative measures, orthotic shoe inserts may allow the athlete to continue participation in running and avoid other treatment modalities that are more costly and time consuming, and therefore less acceptable to them.\r"

Electromyographic evidence of specific femoral nerve injury initially was negative, but was evident 6 weeks following injury. Overuse syndrome in dancers can cause rapid loss of strength. Other conditions such as herniated intervertebral disc, acute hemorrhage, trauma, iliopsoas rupture, and acute stretching must be ruled out. Complete recovery was the natural outcome.\r"

Initially, a dose sufficient to cause convulsions (CD) was given followed by twice the CD (2 x CD), which was administered 48 h later. The CD of bupivacaine (4.3 mg/kg) and ropivacaine (4.9 mg/kg) caused significant (P less than 0.05) increases in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. There was no difference between drug groups. Seizures were abolished by 10 mg/kg of intravenous thiamylal. Endotracheal intubation and controlled respiration with O2-enriched air with no other treatment resulted in rapid and complete recovery in all dogs. All dogs receiving 2 x CD of bupivacaine (8.6 mg/kg) or ropivacaine (9.8 mg/kg) were initially treated with thiamylal and mechanical ventilation. Two dogs in the bupivacaine group developed hypotension, respiratory arrest, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, which were resistant to closed chest cardiac massage, treatment with epinephrine, bretylium, and atropine, and direct current cardioversion. The four remaining dogs in the infusion group were successfully resuscitated. All of the animals in the ropivacaine-treated group survived the administration of the 2 x CD dose. Mild hypotension developed in one dog and was treated with intravenous epinephrine (0.75 mg). This resulted in nodal tachycardia, which was abolished after treatment with bretylium. Another dog had two 1-s bursts of premature ventricular contractions requiring no treatment. The rapid treatment of convulsions and cardiovascular toxicity resulted in a decreased number of deaths in both groups when compared with dogs from a previously published study in which no therapy was instituted. Thus, early aggressive treatment of central nervous system and cardiovascular system toxicity is capable of reducing the incidence of mortality associated with the rapid intravenous administration of excessive doses of local anesthetics.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether low-pressure baroreceptors located in the right atrium could affect the heart rate (HR) during spinal anesthesia, the authors determined the effects of right atrial pressure changes associated with body tilt on HR in 40 unpremedicated patients. Ten-degree head-up body tilt produced significant increases in HR of 6 +/- 1 and 6 +/- 1 beats/min (mean +/- SE, P less than 0.01) and significant decreases in systolic arterial pressure of 2.8 +/- 0.9 and 6.6 +/- 1.7 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) during low (T-10 +/- 0.2, n = 20) and high (T-4 +/- 0.2, n = 20) analgesic levels of tetracaine spinal anesthesia, respectively. Ten-degree head-down body tilt caused significant decreases in HR without significant changes in systolic arterial pressure during spinal anesthesia. The reflex HR responses to body tilt were similar between low and high levels of spinal anesthesia and were preserved after administration of sedatives. The magnitudes of changes in right atrial pressure associated with body tilt were similar during spinal anesthesia and after sedation. These findings suggest that HR responses to head-up body tilt are mediated mainly by arterial baroreceptors even in the face of decreased venous return during low or high levels of spinal anesthesia and that light sedation does not impair this reflex HR response.\r"

Forty-two women, 18-60 yr old, who underwent gynecologic surgery under spinal anesthesia were enrolled in the study. They were divided into two groups (group 1: less than 40 yr old, group 2: greater than or equal to 40 yr old). Before spinal anesthetic injection, we measured the pressure difference produced by postural change from the right lateral decubitus position (non-full-flexed) for needle insertion at the L2-3 interspace to a full-flexed lateral decubitus position with a spinal needle in place. After they returned to the non-full-flexed lateral position, 14 mg of plain tetracaine in 10% dextrose solution (2.8 mL) was injected intrathecally in each patient. Pressure differences had a significant correlation with the cephalad levels of spinal anesthesia in each group; the larger pressure difference was associated with a larger SSA. The relationship was stronger in the younger group (correlation coefficients, 0.82 and 0.63; P-values less than 0.01 in groups 1 and 2, respectively). Three patients in group 1 developed T-2 anesthesia, whereas no one in group 2 did (P less than 0.01), and their pressure difference values ranged from 12 to 16 cm H2O, substantially larger than those of the other patients in group 1. Five patients in group 2 developed T-3 anesthesia, whereas no patient in group 1 (P less than 0.01) did, and their pressure differences were not essentially larger than those of the rest in the same group. The authors conclude that pressure differences correlated with the SSA, although the mechanism remains to be clarified. It seems possible to predict which patient in the younger patient group may develop unintentional high spinal anesthesia (T-3 or higher) by measuring pressure differences.\r"

The Kendall 28-gauge, the Preferred Medical Products 24-gauge, and the 24-gauge Burron catheters averaged 1.22, 1.97, and 3.55 lb to break, respectively. We also tested a commonly used Burron 20-gauge catheter, which is marketed for epidural use, and found it had an average break strength of 6.35 lb. The tested values obtained for the TFX/Rusch catheters were lower than the break strength values supplied by the manufacturers. The authors conclude that the break strength of spinal catheters is one-third to one-half that found for a typical epidural catheter.\r"

One group received 40 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine injected intrapleurally postoperatively. The other group received 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine. The onset time of analgesia was nearly the same in both groups and within 25 min all patients were nearly pain free. Our data demonstrate that 100 mg of bupivacaine with epinephrine elicits effective analgesia after cholecystectomy. There are only minor differences between 20 and 40 mL with regard to pain relief. The authors conclude that the volume of local anesthetic within the range of 20-40 mL in an adult has little influence on the extent or duration of intrapleural analgesia.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the lowest effective dose of epidural sufentanil given for analgesia, 41 patients undergoing elective abdominal gynecologic surgery during continuous epidural anesthesia (lidocaine 2%) were randomly assigned to one of four postoperative treatment groups. Patients received an epidural bolus of either 25 (group A), 40 (group B), 55 (group C), or 70 micrograms (group D) sufentanil in 10 mL of saline. They were evaluated for the next 8 h using a 10-cm visual analogue scale. Except for two individuals in group A, all patients achieved a visual analogue scale score of 1 cm or less during the study interval. The onset of analgesia was most rapid in the two higher dose groups (A vs C and D; P less than 0.05). Pairwise comparison between groups showed a significant difference in the time needed to achieve maximum pain relief between the lowest and highest treatment groups (A vs D; P less than 0.05). Duration of analgesia was also significantly longer in groups C and D than in group A (208.0 +/- 21.1 and 224.0 +/- 14.7 vs 140.0 +/- 10.7 min; P less than 0.05). There were no differences among groups with regard to mean respiratory rate, level of sedation, 24-h narcotic requirements, or incidence of nausea, vomiting, and pruritus (P = NS). A single patient in group D suffered profound respiratory depression within seconds of administration. We conclude that, in patients recovering from lower abdominal surgery, a single 40-55-micrograms epidural bolus of sufentanil provides 3-3.5 h of effective analgesia, and that larger doses are not warranted.\r"

Reproducible tce-MERs were recordable from the tibialis anterior muscle during nitrous oxide/opioid anesthesia in 11 patients. Before the introduction of isoflurane, tce-MER onset latency was 30.8 +/- 1.9 ms, and amplitude ranged from 19 microV to 2.6 mV (median, 209 microV). Operating conditions necessitated neuromuscular blockade in three patients before administration of isoflurane. In the remaining eight patients, introduction of isoflurane in low concentrations resulted in an immediate increase in the latency and a decrease in the amplitude of tce-MERs. The tce-MERs were completely obliterated in all subjects at end-tidal isoflurane concentrations between 0.2% and 0.6% (median, 0.24%). After discontinuation of isoflurane, the tce-MER returned in all patients. The authors conclude that, during nitrous oxide/opioid anesthesia, with the stimulus and recording variables used, isoflurane even at very low concentrations precludes recording of tce-MERs.\r"

We therefore compared forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), functional residual capacity (FRC), and ribcage contribution to ventilation by respiratory inductive plethysmography in 13 conscious healthy male volunteers, sitting and in four horizontal positions used during anesthesia. Forced vital capacity and FEV1 were similar in all positions, except for a significant mean increase in FVC of 300 mL (SD 213) when sitting compared with when supine (P less than 0.001). The mean decrease in FRC was 806 mL (SD 293) between the sitting and supine positions (P less than 0.001). A significant increase in FRC occurred (252 mL, SD 329, P less than 0.01) when supine subjects raised their arms above their heads as required for computed tomography. Functional residual capacity in the prone and lateral positions was significantly larger than in the supine position (mean change 350 mL, P less than 0.001), but was still some 450 mL less than in the sitting position. Mean ribcage contribution was similar in all horizontal positions (32%-36%), whereas supine values were significantly different from those of the sitting position (mean 70%, SD 11, P less than 0.001). In conclusion, the various horizontal postures studied have no effect on FVC, FEV1, or ribcage contribution to ventilation. However, FRC in the prone, lateral, and arms-up positions is on average 250 mL larger than in the supine position, an observation that may affect gas exchange during anesthesia in these positions.\r"

Each opioid had a significant increase in potency (i.e., a decrease in ED50 values) in the burned (15% body surface area) compared with the nonburned groups. Moderate doses of each drug (i.e., ED50 doses estimated from nonburned group data) in each case augmented stress-induced analgesia in the burned group. Analgesic doses failed to prevent a significant increase in plasma beta-endorphin and corticosterone after larger surface area (25%) burns. Regardless of receptor specificity, opioid analgesic potency is increased acutely after burn injuries.\r"

To determine the potential cardiotoxicity of these two drugs when used together, we defined the interaction between moderate plasma bupivacaine concentrations (1270-1760 ng/mL) and halothane (end-tidal concentrations, 0.5%-1.0%) on ventricular contractility and conduction in 22 closed-chest dogs anesthetized with chloralose. Bupivacaine alone (1-mg/kg intravenous bolus plus a 0.1-mg.kg-1.min-1 constant rate infusion) resulted in significant increases in ventricular conduction time (VCT) and effective refractory period (VERP) and nonsignificant decreases in dP/dtmax and blood pressure. The addition of halothane resulted in hypotension and in progressively increasing plasma bupivacaine levels secondary to reduced hepatic clearance, which led to further dose-related significant increases in VCT and VERP and to significant decreases in dP/dtmax and blood pressure. In other dogs given halothane but in which bupivacaine levels were held constant (1400 ng/mL), VCT remained constant and VERP lengthened slightly, whereas dP/dtmax decreased. We conclude that the combination of bupivacaine and halothane can cause adverse effects on ventricular contractility and intraventricular conduction.\r"

  ".W": "Circulatory responses to isoflurane and halothane anesthesia were studied in eight rabbits with biventricular cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (Adriamycin, 14 mg/kg IV over 7 wk) and in eight controls (saline injections). In preliminary operations pulsed-Doppler flow probes were placed on the ascending aorta, left renal artery, and lower abdominal aorta. Each group was studied after 4, 6, and 7 wk of treatment. The development of congestive heart failure (CHF) was associated with decreases in mean arterial pressure and cardiac output (CO) of 14% and 16%, respectively, (P less than 0.05) and an increase in heart rate. In controls, each anesthetic agent produced dose-related decreases in mean arterial pressure and increases in heart rate, but not significant changes in CO. Renal blood flow was reduced to a similar degree by 1.3 MAC halothane (24% decrease) and 1.3 MAC isoflurane (21% decrease); hindlimb blood flow was reduced only by halothane. As CHF developed there was an attenuation of the heart rate response to anesthesia. Halothane, but not isoflurane, significantly reduced CO in more advanced stages of CHF. The changes in renal blood flow and hindlimb blood flow with each anesthetic in the CHF group were similar to those observed in controls and did not vary with week of treatment. Administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (0.2 mg/kg IV) reversed the CO and renal blood flow effects of halothane except after 7 wk of treatment in the CHF group, when the combination of halothane and enalaprilat resulted in severe circulatory depression.\r"

  ".W": "We studied halothane/epinephrine interaction in isolated canine trabeculae using the doses of epinephrine necessary to produce slow responses (epinephrine threshold for the development of slow responses, ETSR) as an indicator. The preparations were depolarized in Tyrode's solution containing 26 mmol/L of KCl, then epinephrine concentrations in the solution were increased in a stepwise manner. Halothane (1%) had no significant effect, whereas 2% and 4% halothane significantly increased the ETSR. alpha 1-Blockade with either 4, 8, or 16 ng/mL of prazosin or 20, 40, or 80 ng/mL of droperidol did not alter the ETSR, whereas beta 1-adrenergic blockade with 8, 17, or 34 ng/mL of metoprolol significantly increased the ETSR. The same trend was observed when either 8 ng/mL of prazosin or 17 ng/mL of metoprolol was given in combination with 2% halothane. Verapamil (5, 10, or 20 ng/mL) increased the ETSR in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that halothane decreases rather than increases the sensitivity of slow calcium channels to epinephrine and that any increase above the baseline ETSR after halothane administration cannot be ascribed to halothane/adrenoceptor interaction but rather to calcium entry-blocking effects of halothane. As slow responses are induced by the activation of slow calcium channels, our findings are consistent with known data that halothane can interfere with slow calcium channel conductance.\r"

Simultaneous CO measurements with the three methods were obtained during various hemodynamic states in eight pigs. Cardiac output ranged from 1 to 3 L/min during the study. For 128 measurements, the mean difference +/- SD between TTD-TDL and TTD-EFM measurements was -0.037 +/- 0.24 L/min and -0.055 +/- 0.23 L/min, respectively. TDL-EFM mean difference +/- SD was -0.017 +/- 0.15 L/min. The limits of the agreement between TTD and the reference methods were 0.4 to -0.5 L/min. The limits of agreement between the reference methods were 0.3 to -0.3 L/min. Regression analysis yielded TTD = 0.383 + 0.779 TDL (r = 0.86); TTD = 0.351 + 0.788 EFM (r = 0.87); TDL = 0.077 + 0.95 EFM (r = 0.95). Only a change greater than 0.6 L/min in TTD CO could predict with 95% confidence a change in TDL or EFM CO. These results suggest that, in the CO range of this study, the TTD method does not accurately reproduce the CO measurements obtained by TDL or EFM.\r"

Clonidine-treated rats received fentanyl/N2O and 10 micrograms/kg of intravenous clonidine 10 min before ischemia, which was produced by right carotid ligation combined with hemorrhagic hypotension to 35 mm Hg for 30 min. Clonidine increased plasma glucose before ischemia and decreased blood catecholamine concentrations during ischemia compared with the control group. Neurologic outcome was evaluated daily for 3 days after ischemia and histopathology was performed at the end of this period. Clonidine significantly improved neurologic outcome on each of the 3 days after ischemia. Histopathology was severe in the control group but not enough rats survived in this group for statistical analysis. The authors conclude that clonidine decreases sympathetic activity during ischemia and that this is associated with an improvement in outcome from incomplete ischemia.\r"

The study was performed as a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in sixteen asthmatic adults. Bronchoconstriction was induced by steady state running on a treadmill. Both 0.5 mg terbutaline and 0.2 mg albuterol have good bronchodilating effects in patients with exercise-induced asthma. There was, however, a faster onset of action after albuterol.

We describe an operating room nurse who was exposed at work to natural rubber (latex) due to the use of latex surgical gloves. After 25 years, she developed contact urticaria, rhinoconjunctivitis and acute asthma following the handling of rubber gloves for surgical purposes. She was symptom-free when on vacation. Skin prick testing demonstrated an immediate skin reaction to latex. Rub testing with surgical gloves was positive. Specific IgE antibodies to latex were found by indirect ELISA. Specific bronchial challenge with latex extract elicited an isolated immediate asthmatic reaction that was inhibited with cromolyn sodium pretreatment. Patch testing to common rubber additives was negative. These results suggest that latex present in surgical rubber gloves and probably acting as inhalant allergen may produce occupational asthma in exposed subjects, probably by means of an IgE-mediated mechanism.\r"

Spirometric measurements in this setting corroborate lack of improvement and reveal significant impairment in indices that may reflect small airways function (FEF25-75). We hypothesized that clearance of inspissated secretions by fiberoptic bronchoscopy with lavage (FOBwL) may promote or hasten the clinical improvement of such patients. Fifty-one therapeutic FOBwL were accomplished in 19 patients during 20 episodes of stabilized yet refractory asthma with mucous impaction. No significant complications were encountered. After FOBwL, spirometric measurements of FEV1, FEF25-75, and FVC increased significantly (P less than .01, paired t test), and correlated with relief of dyspnea and mobilization of secretions with cough. FOBwL can be safely performed in stabilized, refractory asthma, and with apparent efficacy. Further investigation is needed to document the therapeutic utility of FOBwL in refractory asthma.\r"

Adult patients (n = 227) were treated for 2 weeks with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray 200 micrograms QD or 100 micrograms BID or matching placebo during the autumn pollen season. Overall, the administration of fluticasone propionate once daily in the morning was as effective as the twice daily dosage regimen, and either regimen was more effective than placebo. Improvement in clinician-rated and patient-rated nasal symptom scores, including morning nasal obstruction, was evident within three days of fluticasone propionate therapy and continued throughout the treatment period. Fewer patients receiving fluticasone propionate used rescue medication and had nasal eosinophilia compared with patients receiving placebo. Adverse events were similar in frequency and nature in all three treatment groups. Morning plasma cortisol concentrations and response to cosyntropin stimulation were similar across groups and offered no evidence of HPA axis suppression. We conclude that fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray administered once daily is a safe and effective treatment for seasonal allergic rhinitis. The convenience of a once daily regimen may encourage better compliance.\r"

The present study was designed to evaluate bronchodilator responsiveness in children between 2 and 6 years of age with wheezing by means of a computerized lung sound analysis, computer digitized airway phonopneumonography. Children between ages 2 and 6 who were experiencing acute exacerbations of asthma were included in this study population. The 43 children were evaluated by physical examination, pulmonary function testing, if possible, by use of (spirometry or peak flow meter) and transmission of lung sounds to a computer using an electronic stethoscope to obtain a phonopneumograph with sound intensity level determinations during tidal breathing. A control group of 20 known asthmatic patients between the ages of 8 and 52 years who also presented to the office with acute asthma were evaluated similarly. In each of these individuals, a physical examination was followed by complete spirometry as well as computer digitized airway phonopneumonography recordings. Following initial measurements, all patients were treated with nebulized albuterol (0.25 mL in 2 mL of saline). Five minutes after completion of the nebulization all patients were reexamined and repeat pulmonary function tests were performed followed by CDAP recordings. In the study group of children, the mean pretreatment sound intensity level was 1,694 (range 557 to 4,950 SD +/- 745).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A double-blind trial was not done for reasons of patient safety. After a period of management with prednisone and establishment of the minimal dose of prednisone that controlled idiopathic anaphylaxis, ketotifen was initiated and cautious reduction of prednisone was attempted. The prednisone requirement was not altered in two patients, but prednisone was either substantially reduced or terminated in seven patients. Of these seven, three patients developed recurrent symptoms of idiopathic anaphylaxis after tapering and discontinuation of ketotifen, and ketotifen had to be resumed. The statistical analysis of prednisone reduction was highly significant (P less than .004) and we conclude ketotifen was of significant benefit in seven of nine patients with corticosteroid-dependent idiopathic anaphylaxis.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) is a rapid, convenient, and objective way to assess nasal patency. It is used much less commonly, however, than Wright Peak Flow (WPF), in part, because of concerns about its reproducibility. In order to compare the reproducibility of PNIF with WPF, we obtained multiple measurements of both flows in each of ten healthy, nonsmoking, trained subjects five times throughout the same day and daily throughout the same week. Mean PNIFs (L/min) were 140 immediately after arising, 170 at breakfast time, 183 at lunch time, 170 at dinner time, and 161 at bedtime. Corresponding mean WPFs were 528, 528, 535, 535 and 531 L/min. Peak nasal inspiratory flow coefficients of variation representing minute to minute, hour to hour, and day to day variation were 9.8, 13.5, and 9.7, respectively. Corresponding coefficients of variation with WPF, 2.4, 1.9, and 2.3, were significantly lower. Variability of PNIF and WPF did not increase with increased time spans, suggesting that variation in airway size is less important than variation in technique. Responses to intranasal oxymetazoline, as determined by changes in PNIF and changes in subjective assessments of nasal patency, were then evaluated in ten patients with nasal obstruction. These persons noted a mean subjective improvement of 68% (P = .0002) and demonstrated a mean objective improvement of 21% (P = .05). Posttreatment PNIFs of many individuals who reported substantial subjective improvement failed to exceed the expected variability of the test. This experience fails to demonstrate the utility of PNIF determinations for routine clinical use.\r"

Platelet-activating factor is released together with eicosanoids such as thromboxane A2, prostacyclin, and leukotrienes. Its effects in neurons are mediated through a specific receptor coupled to phospholipase C and phosphoinositol metabolism. The cerebrovascular effects of platelet-activating factor include disruption of the blood-brain barrier, edema formation, and vasospasm. It has also been described to possess direct toxicity to neuronal cells in culture. Discovery and development of several highly potent and selective antagonists to platelet-activating factor receptors facilitated experimental studies underscoring the role of this factor as an endogenous mediator in cerebral disorders, particularly cerebral ischemia and trauma. Significant biochemical, microvascular, functional, and behavioral recovery has been demonstrated using these antagonists in an array of experimental models of focal and global ischemia in the central nervous system (CNS). Clearly, studies of platelet-activating factor in experimental models of CNS ischemia and reperfusion injury open a new perspective on phospholipid metabolism in stroke and offer an exceptionally promising therapeutic prospect. Data supporting this factor as a mediator of specific pathological sequelae in stroke and neuroinjury are surveyed in this review. We discuss the mechanisms and significance of platelet-activating factor-mediated effects and propose directions for future studies.\r"

While saccade duration and peak velocity were not significantly different across groups, the scatter of saccade duration was increased in all HIV-positive groups. Saccade latency was not significantly affected. In both simple and complex antisaccade tasks, the asymptomatic, AIDS, and AIDS dementia groups made significantly fewer correct-way antisaccades than did control subjects. Latencies of correct-way antisaccades were increased for AIDS and AIDS dementia groups in the simple antisaccade trials, and for all HIV-positive groups in the complex trials. Fixation stability was significantly worse in the AIDS dementia group than in control subjects. Smooth pursuit gain was decreased in the asymptomatic, AIDS, and AIDS dementia groups for the least demanding trial.

  ".W": "In this study, the terminal complement complex C5b-9 (TCC) was localized by immunocytochemistry at different clinical stages of experimental autoimmune neuritis. Deposits of TCC were found on the surface of Schwann cells and their myelin sheaths, and to some extent in the extracellular space at predilective sites of impending demyelination before onset of clinical signs and for a short period thereafter. Additionally, TCC was deposited on the surface of W3/13 positive leukocytes. No TCC immunoreactivity was seen in the distal stump of transected sciatic nerves 1 to 15 days after axotomy. The early and transient deposition of TCC on Schwann cells and myelin sheaths in experimental autoimmune neuritis before overt demyelination suggests that complement activation plays a pathogenic role in the initiation of immune-mediated myelin damage. The lack of TCC immunoreactivity after nerve transection excludes a nonspecific activation process. The signals involved in local TCC formation in demyelinating peripheral nervous system disorders have yet to be explored.\r"

The patients with neurocanthocytosis all had chorea and variable combinations of seizures, dementia, axonal neuropathy, and orolingual self-multiation. [18F]dopa positron emmission tomographic findings were compared with 30 normal controls and 16 patients with sporadic, L-dopa-responsive, Parkinson's disease. Caudate and anterior putamen [18F]dopa uptake were normal in patients with neuroacanthocytosis, but mean posterior putamen [18F]dopa uptake was reduced to 42% of normal, similar to that in patients with Parkinson's disease. In patients with neuroacanthocytosis, mean equilibrium caudate: cerebellum and putamen: cerebellum [11C]raclopride uptake ratios were reduced to 54% and 62% of normal, compatible with a 65% and 53% loss of caudate and putamen D2-receptor-binding sites, respectively. Striatal and frontal blood flow was also depressed. The severe loss of D2-receptor-bearing striatal neuron, with concomitant loss of dopaminergic projections from the nigra to the posterior putamen, is consistent with both chorea and extrapyramidal rigidity being features of patients with neuroacanthocytosis.\r"

  ".U": "91378206\r", 
  ".W": "In patients with Parkinson's disease and in normal subjects, the influence of tremor on repetitive voluntary movement was investigated in the index finger by comparing frequency of isometric force tremor with frequency of voluntary alternating isometric contractions. Tremor frequency, measured over the range from 0 to 70% maximum voluntary force, usually increased with force. The tremor frequency band was lower and more often overlapped with the upper voluntary frequency range in patients than in normal subjects. Normal subjects could accurately produce voluntary contractions at all cue frequencies from 1 to 5 Hz. Patients could produce auditory-paced frequencies of 1 and 2 Hz, but at higher cue frequencies, their voluntary contractions were often faster or slower than the cue. The faster or \"hastened\" voluntary frequencies were within the tremor frequency band, whereas the slowed voluntary frequencies were below it. Maximal voluntary frequency was often greater than the lowest but always less than the highest tremor frequency. It is concluded that parkinsonian tremor may pace voluntary repetitive movements to go faster than intended with the highest tremor frequency being an upper limit for voluntary frequency. Similar mechanisms may underlie the hastened repetitive vocal responses that were also observed in the parkinsonian patients.\r"

The pattern visual evoked potential P100 latency was prolonged, Group 1 with a mean of 136 +/- 19 msec. Group 2 with a mean of 131 +/- 19 msec (control subjects, 102 +/- 5 msec; n = 84), and the P100 amplitude was reduced, without significant difference between the groups. Abnormal magnetic resonance imaging scans were present in significantly more patients in Group 1 (p less than 0.025). Treatment of optic neuritis with corticosteroids had no effect on the evolution or duration of Uhthoff's symptom. Overall, 35 of 81 (43%) patients, followed for a mean of 3.5 years, developed multiple sclerosis. The incidence was significantly greater in Group 1 (p less than 0.01). Uhthoff's symptom also correlated with a higher incidence of recurrent optic neuritis. We conclude that Uhthoff's symptom is a prognostic indicator for the early development of multiple sclerosis.\r"

This was clinically homogeneous group of patients. All remained predominantly responsive to levodopa, although with marked disability secondary to clinical fluctuations (short-duration responses) and medication-induced dyskinesias; all were receiving substantial doses of levodopa and 6 of the 8 patients were additionally receiving bromocriptine or pergolide. Binding densities of dopamine D2 receptors, as measured by [3H]spiperone binding, were reduced in this group of patients, compared to caudate specimens from autopsy control subjects. This findings may reflect medication-induced receptor downregulation. Parallel changes occurred with muscarinic cholinergic receptors; [3H]QNB binding was significantly reduced, compared to autopsy control values. This reduction of muscarinic receptors might be due to loss of nigrostriatal terminals that are known to contain muscarinic receptors. Alternatively, muscarinic receptors may have been downregulated by increased corticostriatal glutamatergic input to cholinergic cells, inferred to be present based on the prominent levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Finally, receptor deficits could have been a reflection of more widespread degenerative cerebral disease, although levodopa-refractory symptoms were generally not pronounced in these patients.\r"

Purified, biotin-avidin-peroxidase-labeled B. burgdorferi flagella was used as test antigen. Paired cerebrospinal fluid and serum specimens from 100 patients with clinically definite neuroborreliosis and 35 control subjects with neurological diseases were examined. Significant B. burgdorferi-specific intrathecal IgG, A, and M production was found in 89%, 65% and 67% of patients with neuroborreliosis. Local synthesis of specific IgA was only seen in patients with significant local IgG synthesis. Antibody production in cerebrospinal fluid began by 2 weeks after onset of neurological symptoms. At the end of the second week specific IgM, IgG, or both, was detected in 88% of the patients. Specific IgG synthesis was present in all patients by 6 weeks after onset. Specific local IgM synthesis usually disappeared by 3 to 6 months after therapy, whereas specific IgG synthesis persisted after recovery. Even in patients with a severely altered blood-brain barrier, the assay discriminated between intrathecal antibody synthesis and antibody leakage from serum. The assay makes diagnostic measurement of B. burgdorferi-specific intrathecal antibody synthesis reliable, rapid, and accessible as a routine serological test.\r"

Beta nerve growth factor (beta-NGF) has been considered a candidate gene in the pathogenesis and therapy of FAD, based on its localization in the cortex and hippocampus and its ability to enhance the growth and survival of cholinergic neurons. A 1.5-kb fragment of the beta-NGF gene was used to detect a BglII restriction fragment length polymorphism, which was then used for linkage analysis. A total of 30 families (27 late onset) with 147 affected members were studied. Close linkage (theta less than or equal to 0.03, z less than or equal to -2.00) of late-onset FAD with beta-NGF was excluded. Two apparent obligate crossovers between affected members were detected in different autopsy-confirmed families. Based on these results, beta-NGF is not the gene responsible for late-onset FAD in the families analyzed.\r"

Ten required repair of interrupted aortic arch (n = 7) or coarctation with hypoplastic arch (n = 7). Four patients had relief of SAS by either Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection (n = 2) or aortopulmonary window (n = 2), with three operative deaths and one late death. Six had one-stage arterial switch and atrial septectomy with arch repair (5/6) with one operative death and one late death. Two survivors have progressed to bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt, a third has had a Fontan operation, and a fourth awaits Fontan. In group 2, 11 children required operation for acquired SAS after pulmonary artery banding. Nine have progressed to Fontan operation with either staged (n = 3) or concurrent (n = 6) relief of SAS by Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection or subaortic resection. Fontan mortality was 11% (70% confidence limits, 2% to 32%). Group 3 consisted of 3 patients without pulmonary artery banding who had SAS diagnosed at Fontan evaluation. All 3 survived Fontan operation and relief of SAS by Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection or subaortic resection. Group 4 consisted of 1 patient with previous pulmonary artery banding (no SAS) who underwent Fontan operation but required Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection 30 months later for SAS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The internal thoracic artery (ITA) was used bilaterally in 41 patients and unilaterally in 6 with 100 distal anastomoses. Five patients had a single saphenous vein graft. In total, 167 anastomoses (3.55 per patient) were performed. Single IEA grafts were harvested through a paramedian incision and bilateral grafts, a midline incision. Harvest time was 36.5 minutes for IEA grafts and 29.6 minutes for ITA grafts (p less than 0.0001). Graft length was 11.9 cm for IEA grafts and 16.5 cm for ITA grafts (p less than 0.0001). Distal graft diameter was 2.0 mm for IEA grafts and 2.1 mm for ITA grafts (p less than 0.01). Graft flow was 49.7 mL/min for IEA grafts and 48.7 mL/min for ITA grafts. Microscopic assessment of segments of both the IEA and ITA from 14 patients revealed similar internal elastic laminae and an equal number of fenestrations. Combined intimal and medial thickness was comparable in both conduits. Medial elastic tissue was more prominent in ITA grafts and lacking in eight of the 14 IEA grafts. Gross plaque formation was noted in the proximal 1 to 3 cm of 50% of IEA grafts, but the lumen was not compromised and microscopic thickening was minimal. An unexpected finding was medial calcifications (Monckeberg's disease) in two of the 14 IEAs without associated atherosclerosis. There was one hospital death, one abdominal wound infection, and one instance of fat necrosis superficial to the sternum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-seven patients have undergone 28 bilateral sequential lung transplantations over the past 14 months. Eighteen patients had transplantation because of end-stage emphysema; 6, cystic fibrosis; and 1 each, obliterative bronchiolitis, usual interstitial pneumonitis with pulmonary fibrosis, and bronchiectasis. Cardiopulmonary bypass was used electively in the first 5 patients until it was recognized that the procedure could be done safely without it, and in only 3 additional recipients has it been employed. Mean ischemic time for the first lung was 276 +/- 43 minutes and for the second lung, 410 +/- 64 minutes. There have been five deaths, three in the postoperative period (11% operative mortality) and two late. The other patients are alive and well and do not require oxygen 2 to 15 months after transplantation. Mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second rose from 16% +/- 8% of predicted to 84% +/- 17% at 12 weeks. Six-minute walk values increased from a mean of 251 +/- 91 m to 666 +/- 42 m at 24 weeks. The excellent exposure afforded to both hemithoraces by the thoracosternotomy incision and the rare need of cardiopulmonary bypass have allowed us to offer the option of transplantation to patients who formerly would have been turned down because of previous pulmonary resection or pleurectomy. On four occasions, ventilator-dependent patients underwent successful transplantation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of 251 patients with aortic regurgitation, 107 (42.6%) had nonprosthetic operation. The mean age was 23 years, and 90 patients (84.1%) were rheumatic. Two techniques were used: repair (annular and leaflet plasties, 69 cases) and cusp extension with glutaraldehyde-treated pericardium (25 bovine, 13 autologous). There were two hospital deaths (1.8%), both in the repair group, and no late deaths or embolic events. Only 5 patients (4.7%) were anticoagulated. In the repair group there were 12 reoperations, four (5.9%) due to aortic and eight to mitral dysfunction. In the cusp extension group there were two reoperations due to mitral dysfunction. Echocardiographic follow-up showed better results with cusp extension. In conclusion, conservative operation for aortic regurgitation is possible in a high percentage of young rheumatic patients and does not require anticoagulation. Cusp extension is more reliable than repair in terms of early results, although its long-term durability is not yet known.\r"

  ".W": "Revascularization procedures after recent myocardial infarction are associated with higher mortality and morbidity compared with elective coronary artery bypass grafting. Traditional methods of myocardial protection impose a further ischemic insult on already compromised myocardium. Continuous cold blood cardioplegia may eliminate ischemia but may still leave the heart anaerobic. Theoretically, warm aerobic arrest addresses both of these issues and may become an attractive alternative to standard hypothermic ischemic arrest in this setting. In 115 nonrandomized patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting within 6 hours to 7 days of an acute myocardial infarction, myocardial protection was provided with continuous cold (4 degrees C) or continuous warm (37 degrees C) blood cardioplegia. Fifty-one patients (after 1988) protected with warm blood cardioplegia were compared with a historical cohort of 64 patients (before 1988) protected with cold blood cardioplegia. Results indicate that the warm cardioplegia group had no mortality versus 10.9% for the cold group (p less than 0.05), a myocardial infarction rate of 2.0% in the warm versus 9.3% in the cold group, and use of intraaortic balloon pump of 0% versus 12.5%, respectively (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that continuous warm aerobic arrest may minimize ischemia and anaerobic metabolism during the operative procedure, and may be of benefit to patients who have a limited tolerance to ischemic insult.\r"

Associated anomalies included Ebstein's anomaly, sudden death syndrome, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, abdominal aortic aneurysm, neurofibromatosis, other arrhythmias, or other complex congenital heart disease. Forty-one patients had multiple accessory pathways. Operative results showed a 7% initial failure rate, which dropped to 3% after reoperation. One patient had undergone previous operation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome at another institution. Procedures performed concomitantly included mitral or tricuspid valve repair or replacement (6), right ventricular conduit replacement, subaortic resection, Fontan repair, corrected transposition repair, coronary artery bypass, and placement of an automatic internal cardioverter defibrillator. There was no operative mortality. Late follow-up is 27 +/- 16 months, and complications included mitral regurgitation and myocardial infarction. By comparison, in the last 12 months 124 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome underwent catheter ablation using radiofrequency current. There were 9 patients with multiple pathways. One hundred twelve patients (90%) had all accessory atrioventricular connections ablated and have remained free of symptomatic tachycardia. There have been 12 failures (10%), of which 5 have had operation and 7 are being treated medically. Mean follow-up is 7 +/- 5 months, and complications included circumflex coronary artery occlusion, excessive bleeding, valve perforation, and cerebral vascular accident.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of the 8 patients, 6 were clinically diagnosed as having metachronous lung cancers and 2, local recurrent tumors. The mean interval between operations in patients with metachronous lung cancers was 62 months (range, 15 to 128 months). Both tumors showed the same histology in 4 patients and a different histology in 2. In the 2 patients with local recurrent tumors, the interval between operations was 9 months and 39 months. In the analysis of DNA flow cytometry of the first and second tumors in the same patient, the tumors were defined as independent of each other when one tumor showed diploidy and the other, aneuploidy, or when each DNA index of abnormal clones between two aneuploid tumors was different. When both tumors showed diploidy or when at least one DNA index of abnormal clones between two aneuploid tumors was identical, the tumors were defined to be related to each other. According to these criteria, in 5 (83%) of the 6 patients clinically diagnosed as having metachronous lung cancers, the second tumor was classified as independent of the first tumor. On the other hand, in the 2 patients clinically diagnosed as having recurrent tumors, the second tumor was judged to be related to the first tumor. These data suggest that DNA flow cytometric analysis of tumors may be of value in the diagnosis of metachronous lung cancers.\r"

Ventricular septal rupture occurred soon after acute myocardial infarction (3.4 +/- 4 days), and the first medical treatment occurred 6.7 +/- 7 days after onset of acute myocardial infarction. Three patients had a previous myocardial infarction. The site of the rupture was anterior in 38 patients (57%) and posterior in 28 (43%). Forty-four patients (67%) were in shock at the time of admission. Intraaortic balloon pumping was used preoperatively in 28. Operation was performed at the time of maximal efficacy of medical treatment. The same technique was used in all cases. Associated procedures included coronary bypass grafting in 5 patients and valvar operation in 5. The patients have been carefully followed up for up to 16 years. Hospital mortality was 45% (30 patients) and was cardiac related or due to acute renal failure in 25 patients (83%). No correlation could be revealed between early death and age, sex, preoperative intraaortic balloon pumping, or year of operation. Location of the ventricular septal rupture (early mortality of 57% for posterior versus 37% for anterior ventricular septal rupture) and shock at the time of admission (52% versus 32%) showed a trend toward significance (0.08 less than or equal to p less than 0.10).

This investigation was designed to assess new bone formation and sternal healing across the linear osteotomy of the sternum and to determine if rigid fixation would enhance bony healing and thus decrease unfavorable sequelae. To test this hypothesis, 14 skeletally mature baboons (Papio anubis) underwent standard median sternotomy; seven sternotomies were closed with interrupted 24-gauge cerclage wires, and seven, with thin Vitallium compression miniplates and transverse lag screws. The sterna from each group were harvested en bloc at 4 and 8 weeks, radiographed, processed, and serially sectioned and stained for histomorphometry to assess the quantity of new bone across the linear osteotomy. Clinical stability was superior with the plated and lag screw group at 4 weeks; however, by 8 weeks, no clinical difference between treatments was apparent. Histomorphometric analysis indicated that the linear osteotomy gap treated with plates and screws was less than the gap associated with the wire group. Rigid fixation of the sternum resulted in earlier union with primary osseous healing, suggesting greater inherent stability. these factors may decrease adverse sequelae for this procedure.\r"

Isolated rabbit heart models with whole blood perfusion were used, and 18 hearts were divided into three groups according to the reperfusion method: control (G-1, n = 5), DN-9693 (G-2, n = 7), and leukocyte depletion (G-3, n = 6). The hearts were subjected to 120 minutes of cold global ischemia under crystalloid cardioplegia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. A dose of 20 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 of DN-9693 was administered in G-2, and a leukocyte removal filter was used in G-3 during reperfusion. Ultrastructural changes in mitochondrial injuries, intracellular edema, and capillary injuries of the myocardium showed worse changes in G-1 than in G-2 and G-3. Under microscopic study, the intracapillary leukocyte count was significantly higher in G-1 than in G-2 and G-3. Recovery of rate-pressure product, left ventricular developed pressure, and coronary flow were significantly better in G-2 and G-3 than in G-1. There were no significant differences between G-2 and G-3 for all these indices. These results indicate that reperfusion with leukocyte-depleted blood attenuates reperfusion myocardial injury and DN-9693 has a comparable myocardial protective effect with possible inhibition of leukocyte aggregation.\r"

At least one internal mammary artery was grafted in all but 1 patient, with supplemental saphenous vein grafts. Intraoperatively, autologous heparinized blood was removed before bypass and retransfused at the conclusion of extracorporeal circulation. The volume remaining in the oxygenator and tubing set was returned without cell processing or hemofiltration. Using the hard-shell cardiotomy reservoir from the heart-lung machine, autotransfusion of the shed mediastinal blood was continued hourly up to 18 hours after operation. The mean postoperative mediastinal blood loss was 643 +/- 354 mL, whereas 624 +/- 296 mL was autotransfused. Thirteen patients (2.6%) needed reexploration for bleeding, of whom 7 (7/500, 1.4%) received homologous blood. No other patients required red cell transfusions. In addition, 9 patients were given a mean of 2.6 units of fresh frozen plasma because of suspected coagulopathy. No platelets were transfused, and no cryoprecipitate therapy was undertaken. Thus, in total, 484 patients (96.8%) were not exposed to any homologous blood products during the hospital stay. At discharge, the mean hemoglobin concentration was 121 +/- 14 g/L (12.1 +/- 1.4 g/dL) and the hematocrit, 0.36 +/- 0.04. Postoperative complications were few. There was one in-hospital death (0.2%).\r"

Fifty-three patients with refractory cardiogenic shock were selected for Hemopump assistance. The hemodynamic definition of cardiogenic shock included (1) a cardiac index of less than 2.0 L.min-1.m-2, (2) pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of greater than 18 mm Hg, and (3) a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or a left ventricular work index of less than 1,500 g-m.m-2.min-1. The Hemopump was successfully inserted in 41 of 53 patients (77.3%). A significant improvement in the hemodynamic status was seen during Hemopump assistance. A minimal level of hemolysis was observed. No leg ischemia was observed. The 30-day overall survival of the Hemopump group was 31.7%. Criteria establishing indications for use and clinical utility are proposed. We conclude that the Hemopump provides significant hemodynamic support of the patient in cardiogenic shock allowing for recovery from ventricular stunning in marginal ventricles, and that in select patients the Hemopump may offer a major improvement in survival over conventional therapy.\r"

The infected group required intubation and nasogastric suction for a significantly longer time than the noninfected group (p less than 0.001). Time to enteral alimentation was significantly longer in the infected group (p less than 0.02). We were unable to correlate the number of infections with the lengths of intubation, nasogastric suction, or time to enteral alimentation.

Each examination included a manubrial and a sternal body print. At each level, we studied the occurrence of spacing or misalignment of the sternal layers. The 66 patients were subdivided into four groups according to the type of conduit harvested (single left internal thoracic artery or saphenous vein) and the type of material used for the sternal closure (steel wires or nylon yarns). In all cases, adequate early sternal approximation, which is represented by a good alignment as well as by an excellent contact of the sternal layers, was infrequently demonstrated. Moreover, the two abnormalities most often observed were manubrial spacing and sternal body misalignment. The sternal closure technique and internal thoracic artery harvesting had no significant effect on the sternal approximation. To minimize manubrial spacing and sternal body misalignment, we propose that the surgeon should apply three threads through the manubrium, withdraw the shoulder roll beforehand, elevate both of the patient's shoulders, and maintain the two xyphoid layers in the same plane and in fairly close contact during the tightening of the wires.\r"

At 20 degrees C ECS induced a 30% contraction, but at 6 degrees C no contraction (n = 5) or a weak contraction (n = 1) was elicited. Neither prostaglandin E1 nor nifedipine caused any significant reduction of the vasocontraction elicited by ECS and UCLA. Krebs solution, enriched with potassium in amounts corresponding to those in ECS (115 mmol/L) or UCLA (30 mmol/L), induced vasocontraction comparing well with those induced by ECS or UCLA, indicating that it is the high potassium content that causes the vasocontraction. In a second experiment lung segments were stored at 4 degrees C for 9 hours in ECS, UCLA, or Krebs solution. Pulmonary arterial segments were then studied in organ baths at 37 degrees C. The choice of preservation solution did not significantly affect the contractile properties of potassium, noradrenaline, or the thromboxane mimic U-46619. To conclude, high potassium contents in organ preservation solutions induce strong pulmonary vasocontraction in lung temperatures greater than 20 degrees C but not in temperatures less than 10 degrees C. These vasocontractions are not significantly reduced by prostaglandin E1 or nifedipine. We suggest that the initial preservation solution used to cool down the lungs should contain 4 mmol/L or no potassium. When the lung temperature is less than 10 degrees C, a second perfusion might be done, and then a high potassium content (if thought to be essential) will not cause vasocontraction.\r"

No patient had documented or suspected arrhythmias preoperatively. Forty-nine patients received 178 mEq of magnesium given over the first 4 postoperative days, and 50 patients received only placebo. The clinical characteristics of both groups were similar. The preoperative mean serum magnesium concentration was similar in both study (1.90 mEq/L) and placebo (1.90 mEq/L) groups. The mean postoperative serum magnesium concentration in study patients was significantly elevated over postoperative days 1 through 4 when compared with preoperative levels (p less than 0.001). The postoperative mean serum magnesium concentration in control patients declined and remained significantly depressed through postoperative day 3 (p less than 0.001), but increased to preoperative levels by postoperative day 4. The mean serum magnesium concentration was significantly greater in the study patients as compared with the control patients over postoperative days 1 through 4 (p less than 0.001). Although there was no significant difference between groups with respect to episodes of ventricular arrhythmias, there was a significant decrease in the number of episodes of atrial fibrillation in the group receiving magnesium therapy (p less than 0.02). There were no recognized adverse effects of magnesium therapy. Prophylactic magnesium administration seems to lessen the incidence and severity of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting.\r"

We present 4 pediatric cardiac surgical patients, aged 1 day to 9 months, who exhibited cardiovascular collapse in their early postoperative course. In each patient, cardiovascular deterioration was marked by an insidious decrease in arterial blood pressure without an associated change in heart rate, central venous pressure, or airway pressure. Bradycardia followed the decrease in blood pressure. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex was suspected and atropine was administered, first as a bolus injection at 0.01 mg/kg, and later, as a continuous infusion at 0.01 mg.kg-1.h-1. Atropine prevented recurrent episodes of hypotension and bradycardia. We believe the Bezold-Jarisch reflex is more prevalent than previously suspected in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical patients.\r"

The AD was diagnosed clinically in 5 patients, and 2 underwent attempted operative repair. Two patients who had the AAA resected because of suspected rupture were found later to have ruptured a more proximal AD. Thus, AD occurs occasionally in patients who have AAA. In older persons with suspected rupture of an AAA, a more proximal rupture of an AD should be ruled out. When both AAA and AD are present in the same patient, the AD is more likely the cause of cardiovascular collapse than is rupture of the AAA.\r"

The majority of patients (68%) had reoperation for outgrown or degenerated conduits. In 17 patients, the sternum was opened with a chisel. Two of these patients sustained conduit neointimal collapse from manipulation, and 3 had conduit tear requiring immediate cardiopulmonary bypass through the femoral vessels. In the last 5 patients, the sternum was opened above and below the conduit, and the inner table was chiseled and left attached to the conduit avoiding injury and undue conduit manipulation. Cardiopulmonary bypass and operation were carried out uneventfully. We believe that the recent technique described provides a safe alternative approach to valved conduits adherent to the sternum.\r"

  ".U": "91378681\r", 
  ".W": "Between 1979 and 1988, a total of 53 infants less than 1 year of age underwent repair of coarctation. Thirty-seven patients (70%) were younger than 3 months. Median age was 0.9 month. Four different surgical techniques were used: resection with end-to-end anastomosis, patch enlargement, subclavian flap aortoplasty, and subclavian displacement aortoplasty (Meier-Mendonca technique). Hospital mortality was 7.5% and was limited to patients with additional complex intracardiac defects. Neither age nor surgical technique had an influence on the operative risk. Follow-up averaged 15 to 43 months for the four different groups. Restenosis developed in 9 (19%) of 47 patients regularly followed up, 5 (11%) of whom have had reoperation. Age at operation was not a predictor for restenosis, which occurred in 17.4% of patients less than 1 month and 20.8% of those greater than 1 month of age at operation. Patch enlargement and the subclavian displacement technique demonstrated the highest restenosis rates (42% and 43%, respectively). However, patients who underwent patch enlargement had less favorable pathological conditions. It is concluded that results of coarctation repair in early infancy do not depend as much on the operative method itself as on the specific pathological aspect, which largely determines the method of treatment. Some reservation must be made in regard to the subclavian displacement technique.\r"

However, there is histological evidence that the juxtaductal coarctation shelf is composed of smooth muscle of ductal origin, which subsequently fibroses. This abnormal tissue may be at risk for late aneurysm development, particularly if balloon dilatation angioplasty is required. The fact that this abnormal tissue is not removed by the subclavian flap procedure is one of the inherent disadvantages of that procedure. Other disadvantages include the need to sacrifice the left subclavian artery and the fact that, unlike resection and end-to-end anastomosis, the subclavian flap procedure does not lend itself to augmentation of the hypoplastic distal aortic arch. Furthermore, occasionally a secondary coarctation membrane is present within the distal aortic arch, and though it is readily detected during the resection procedure, it can be missed with the subclavian flap procedure. Based on these considerations rather than on a demonstrated superiority of either procedure, my colleagues and I currently prefer resection and end-to-end anastomosis over subclavian flap aortoplasty.\r"

It is more often present when the coarctation is associated with intracardiac lesions that diminish or limit forward flow in the ascending aorta and promote right to left flow through an arterial duct. The increased frequency of surgical treatment of infants with complex coarctation, which is in part related to the ability to stabilize their condition with prostaglandin E1, has posed the question of the potential for growth and development of the originally hypoplastic aortic arch after conventional repair of aortic coarctation. Review of our experience with transverse aortic arch hypoplasia, found in 33 (32%) of 102 infants undergoing coarctation repair by subclavian flap aortoplasty or classic resection and end-to-end anastomosis, revealed excellent growth of the transverse arch after repair in all patients available for linear follow-up. The currently proposed extended arch repair should be reserved for the small group of infants with transverse aortic arch to ascending aorta diameter ratios (arch indices) of less than 0.25.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-nine patients underwent operation for coarctation of the aorta. Age ranged from 1 day to 21 years and weight, from 1.5 to 70.4 kg. Numerous methods of repair were used. The operative mortality was low (1.3%), and 17 patients (11.3%) died late. Recoarctation occurred in 13 patients (9.4%). We attempted to correlate mortality and recoarctation with the surgical procedure. A review of the literature revealed no classifications of coarctation that applied to the anatomical and pathological variations we found at the time of operation. Therefore, we devised a surgical classification to separate the various entities in the spectrum of coarctation: type I = primary coarctation; type II = coarctation with isthmus hypoplasia; and type III = coarctation with tubular hypoplasia involving the isthmus and segment between the left carotid and left subclavian arteries. Each of these types has subtypes: A = with ventricular septal defect and B = with other major cardiac defects. We believe that rather than labeling one procedure as \"the procedure of choice,\" providing this classification will allow the surgeon to use a method of repair that is suited to the anatomical variation.\r"

  ".W": "Since the initial report of coarctation balloon angioplasty in 1982, several groups have used this technique for native coarctations in neonates, infants, and children and for postoperative recoarctations. However, recommendations for use of balloon angioplasty as a treatment procedure of choice are clouded by reports of aneurysm development at the site of coarctation. Here we review our experience as well as that published in the literature, including Valvuloplasty and Angioplasty of Congenital Anomalies Registry data, and present evidence in support of balloon angioplasty as a therapeutic procedure of choice for treating native and recurrent postoperative aortic coarctations. Balloon angioplasty of native aortic coarctations in 20 neonates and infants 1 year old or less reduced peak systolic pressure gradient across the coarctation from 40 +/- 12 mm Hg (mean +/- standard deviation) to 11 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); no patient required immediate surgical intervention. The residual gradient at follow-up (mean follow-up, 12 months) in 16 infants was 18 +/- 16 mm Hg, a significant improvement (p less than 0.01) compared with preangioplasty values. In none of the patients did an aneurysm develop. Recoarctation developed in 5 (31%) of the 16 infants and was successfully treated either by surgical resection (in 2) or by repeat balloon angioplasty (in 3). A comparison of mortality and recurrence rates between the balloon angioplasty and surgical groups was made with the help of data pooled from the literature published since 1980. The initial (7% versus 23%) and late (2% versus 25%) mortality and recoarctation (11% versus 18%) rates were higher (p less than 0.025) after surgical intervention than after balloon therapy. When only reports in which patients were operated on after 1979 were included in this type of analysis, the initial and late mortality rates remained higher (p less than 0.01) after operation than after angioplasty, and the recoarctation rates became similar (p greater than 0.1). Thirty-two children (greater than 1 year old) underwent balloon angioplasty of native coarctation with a resultant reduction in peak systolic pressure gradient from 48 +/- 19 mm Hg to 10 +/- 9 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), which continued to remain low (14 +/- 11 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) at follow-up catheterization in 24 children 13 months (mean) later. There were no immediate or late deaths. A small aneurysm developed in 1 patient (4%) but did not require intervention. Recoarctation developed in 2 patients (8%), and in both, repeat balloon angioplasty was performed with good results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Staged repair of interrupted aortic arch and ventricular septal defect was carried out in 20 infants from 1979 through 1990. Among the important associated cardiac defects were transposition of the great arteries, truncus arteriosus, and anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery. The first stage, usually consisting of the placement of an 8- or 10-mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft, pulmonary artery banding, and ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus, resulted in 20 survivors (100%) There were two interim deaths (10%) before the second stage of ventricular septal defect closure and pulmonary artery band removal, which had 15 survivors (83%, 15/18). Because the major morbidity and mortality early in this experience could be traced to leaving the pulmonary artery band on too long, early removal (within 2 to 3 months) was begun. Since 1985, 8 (100%) of 8 infants have survived both stages and are now doing well. Because of the relatively large polytetrafluoroethylene graft, only 1 child (aged 9 years) has experienced substantial late aortic arch obstruction and undergone placement of an 18-mm Dacron graft without difficulty. Of interest is the finding that in only 1 (5%) of the 20 patients has major (greater than or equal to 40-mm Hg gradient) left ventricular outflow tract obstruction developed. In summary, the staged repair of interrupted aortic arch with ventricular septal defect has become very reliable despite the condition of the infant or major associated cardiac anomalies and can be recommended for infants at high risk for primary repair. More long-term information will be needed to determine which approach will be the best choice for the majority of infants.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical repair of the small aortic root is limited in part by the very structure of the outflow tract from the left ventricle. The root is not constructed on the basis of a ringlike annulus supporting the leaflets of the aortic valve. The only truly circular structure within the outflow tract is the junction of the aortic wall with the underlying ventricular structures, themselves partly muscular and partly fibrous. This circular ventriculoarterial junction is crossed by the semilunar attachments of the leaflets of the aortic valve, producing an interlinking arrangement between the expanded aortic sinuses and three triangles of fibrous tissue placed beneath the apexes of the commissures between the valve leaflets. The triangles form extensions of the left ventricle that are related, in part, to the pericardial cavity surrounding the heart. The arrangements of the attachment of the leaflets in malformed valves with two (or only one) effective leaflets are highly abnormal, although these valves are usually produced on the template of three aortic sinuses. The valve with two leaflets rarely gives problems during childhood. In valves producing \"critical stenosis\", there is usually only one effective leaflet, a condition due to incomplete liberation of two of the anticipated three commissures. Detailed study shows that, in these malformed hearts, the attachment of the leaflets is much more annular than in normal valves, with inadequate formation of the fibrous triangles.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical treatment of hypoplasia of the ascending aorta is a difficult problem. An approach using proximal pulmonary artery to distal aorta bypass with distal pulmonary artery banding was employed in 19 patients with an ascending aorta less than 6 mm in diameter but a patent aortic outflow. There were 11 male and 8 female neonates and infants, and weight ranged from 2 to 4.5 kg (median weight, 3.5 kg). Four patients had transposition of the great arteries, 12 had subaortic stenosis, and 5 had interrupted aortic arch. There was one operative death. Cerebral cyanosis developed in 3 of the 4 patients with transposition of the great arteries and necessitated additional operations within the first year postoperatively. Therefore, palliation with a pulmonary artery to descending aorta conduit and banding was abandoned in such patients. All 14 surviving patients with normally related great arteries had successful palliation and growth of left heart structures. Subsequent procedures included a Fontan/Damus procedure in 1 patient, patch aortoplasty and pulmonary arterioplasty in 5 patients, arch reconstruction with aortic valvulotomy and pulmonary arterioplasty in 2, double arch reconstruction in 2, and simple patch aortoplasty with plans for subsequent pulmonary arterioplasty and ventricular septal defect closure in 1. Results demonstrate that in patients with a hypoplastic ascending aorta, this radical method of palliation can result in growth of right and left heart structures and thus provides the possibility of biventricular repair.\r"

This approach was used in 22 patients with tunnel subaortic stenosis (19 patients) or diffuse hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (3 patients). The obstructive tissue was resected through an aortoseptal approach. In 18 patients, associated hypoplasia of the aortic orifice necessitated aortic valve replacement using the Konno procedure; in 4 patients with a normal-sized aortic orifice, the native aortic valve was preserved. There were two early deaths and one late death (all after a Konno operation). Long-term adequate relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was achieved in all survivors. Operation for diffuse subaortic stenosis should be performed with two main goals: (1) to obtain complete relief of the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction by the appropriate procedure and (2) to preserve the native aortic valve whenever possible, particularly in young patients.\r"

  ".W": "A new technique for the treatment of congenital valvar aortic stenosis is described. It consists of augmenting the aortic cusp by extending the commissurotomy incision into the aortic wall around the leaflet insertion, mobilizing the valve cusp attachment at the commissures, and freeing the aortic insertion of the rudimentary commissure. The results of standard valvotomy performed on 48 patients (group 1) were compared with those of the new extended valvuloplasty carried out on 16 patients (group 2). The two groups were comparable in age at operation (2.7 +/- 2.1 years for group 1 versus 2.1 +/- 1.7 years for group 2; p = not significant) and in preoperative pressure gradient (58 +/- 25 mm Hg for group 1 versus 61 +/- 36 mm Hg for group 2; p = not significant). There was no operative mortality in either group. Follow-up is available on all patients, with a mean of 4.3 +/- 2.6 years for group 1 versus 1.7 +/- 0.5 years for group 2 (p = 0.05). There was one late death in group 1. Postoperative gradient was 47 +/- 13 mm Hg in group 1 versus 19 +/- 13 mm Hg in group 2 (p = 0.05). Moderate or severe regurgitation was present in 18 patients (38%) in group 1 and 2 patients (13%) in group 2 (p = not significant). Reoperation was needed in 8 patients (17%) in group 1 versus 2 patients (13%) in group 2 (p = not significant). The described valvuloplasty procedure addresses the unique pathological features of valvar aortic stenosis and provides better relief of the obstruction than the presently available techniques. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the late results of this approach.\r"

Extended aortic root replacement incorporates the concepts of aortic root replacement and aortoventriculoplasty to create a comparatively simple procedure. Unique features of the technique include the implantation of an allograft, which makes the need for anticoagulation obsolete, and use of the donor mitral leaflet to enlarge the outflow tract. Since 1985, 32 patients in Denver have undergone placement of a cryopreserved aortic valve allograft as part of extended aortic root replacement. There were four hospital deaths (13%), and 1 child underwent cardiac transplantation 30 hours after operation. In 6 months to 4.8 years of follow-up, a 14-year-old boy with familial hyperlipidemia required coronary artery bypass grafting, and 3 children experienced allograft calcification with progressive insufficiency, which prompted allograft replacement. The other 23 patients are clinically well.\r"

The age of the patients having the Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure ranged from 0.5 year to 5 years (mean age, 2.2 +/- 1 years). Four patients had transposition, 2 had Taussig-Bing anomaly, and 1 had corrected transposition. Indications for the Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure were side-by-side great arteries associated with difficult coronary anatomy (5 patients), single coronary system (1 patient), and subaortic stenosis (1). A graft between the ascending and descending aorta for interrupted aortic arch made mobilization and posterior displacement of the ascending aorta for the arterial switch difficult. Subaortic stenosis (1 patient), subpulmonary ventricular septal defect (2 patients), and restrictive ventricular septal defect (4) precluded the Rastelli procedure. In 6 patients, the main pulmonary artery was transected at the band, a proximal main pulmonary artery to aorta anastomosis was complemented with a synthetic patch, and a right ventricle to distal main pulmonary artery valved conduit was inserted. Four patients had closure of the aortic outflow. Two patients had postoperative bleeding and 2, heart block. The only patient who did not have transection of the main pulmonary artery, an omission that led to an obstructed conduit at the distal anastomosis, died late. Two patients subsequently needed aortic outflow closure for critical aortic insufficiency. The Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedure has a definite role and can be safely performed in patients with transposition of the great arteries and Taussig-Bing anomalies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Some of this mortality is related to development of anatomical problems such as restrictive atrial septal defect, neoaortic arch obstruction, and pulmonary artery distortion. The bidirectional Glenn shunt has proved to be an ideal adjunctive procedure for high-risk patients at the time of operation to correct such intermediate-term problems. The fenestrated Fontan procedure, which involves fenestration of the interatrial baffle placed as part of our current standard Fontan procedure, is applied for patients considered to be at moderate risk for a Fontan procedure. The decision regarding closure of the fenestration is made by hemodynamic study including temporary balloon occlusion of the fenestration. The fenestration is closed with the double-clamshell device, which is placed percutaneously in the catheterization laboratory and which is currently used for secundum atrial septal defect closure. Appropriate selection of patients for the bidirectional Glenn shunt or fenestrated Fontan procedure with or without fenestration closure has resulted in a dramatic decrease in mortality and morbidity for patients with all forms of single ventricle and for patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.\r"

As survival for first-stage reconstruction by the Norwood procedure has improved, a greater number of patients are potential candidates for the Fontan operation, but not all will be suitable at an acceptable risk. These patients may be treated by cardiac transplantation. The results of a treatment protocol for 90 patients with classic hypoplastic left heart syndrome or its variants at The University of Michigan are reported, with particular attention given to those patients surviving initial palliation but judged to be unsuitable for a subsequent Fontan procedure.\r"

The number of transplantations continues to increase, in part because of transplantations in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and patients with congenital defects. The immunosuppression regimens were more uniform than in the 1985 survey, and triple therapy was most common. Actuarial survival rates were 85% at 1 month, 72% at 1 year, 64% at 3 years, and 60% at 5 years. However, these improved rates are still not equal to the survival of the overall cardiac transplant population, in part because of lower survival rates in neonates. Ventricular dysfunction and rejection, rather than infection, were the leading causes of death. Rejection and infection were the most frequent complications. Also common were hypertension (39%) and seizures (25%), whereas coronary artery disease (8%) was unusual. Functional results were excellent in 85%, and only 7% were disabled. Questions concerning growth rates and many other aspects cannot yet be answered. However, it is apparent that cardiac transplantation in the pediatric population is a very worthwhile endeavor.\r"

Among our pediatric transplant patients, 10 children aged 3 to 15 years, weighing 9 to 45 kg, and all previously operated on for a total of 18 interventions had 32 anomalies needing correction at the time of transplantation. Besides the 18 instances of great vessel abnormalities, 14 anomalies of the atrium and of the venous return were encountered either alone or in combination: single atrium or previous septectomy (4), hypoplastic left atrium (2), previous Mustard procedure (1), cor triatriatum (1), anomalous pulmonary venous return (3), and anomalous systemic venous return (3). The preparation of the donor heart was modified in four ways: right atrial paraseptal incision, left atrial flap technique, full-length mobilization of the pulmonary arteries, and aortic arch incision. Correction of the atrial and venous return anomalies was carried out at the time of orthotopic transplantation with the following techniques: atrial septation, atrial enlargement, superior systemic venous return reroofing, inferior systemic venous return reroofing, double venous rerouting (pulmonary and systemic), and septal realignment. One child died of pulmonary hypertension in the early postoperative period. After a follow-up ranging from 1 month to 52 months, all survivors are asymptomatic. Based on echocardiography, heart catheterization, and angiography, there are no stenoses and no shunts, and the atrial dimensions are good. Based on the results achieved with these surgical techniques, we conclude that most atrial lesions, anomalous pulmonary venous returns, and anomalous systemic venous returns are correctable at the time of orthotopic transplantation and do not preclude a successful outcome in children.\r"

  ".W": "The number of heart transplantations performed over the past 3 years has plateaued. However, the number of pediatric transplantations continues to slowly increase. Unlike adult heart transplantation, for which cardiomyopathy remains the most frequent indication, structural congenital heart disease is the primary indication in children. This report reviews our experience with orthotopic heart transplantation in the presence of structural congenital heart disease with and without prior palliative repair. The diagnoses included transposition of the great arteries, common atrium, left superior vena cava with and without a bridging innominate vein, dextrocardia, and univentricular configurations. The palliative repairs included Blalock-Taussig shunt, bilateral Glenn shunt, Fontan repair, and Mustard and Rastelli procedure. There were no early deaths. Two rejection-related late deaths have occurred at 8 months and at 3 years postoperatively. Extended use of donor tissue and modifications to surgical technique allowed for successful orthotopic heart transplantation in these patients who had structural congenital heart disease with and without prior surgical palliation.\r"

Early gastric cancer (moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma) was present at the edge of an ulcer in the posterior wall of the upper gastric body. In addition, a carcinoid tumor was found adjacent to adenocarcinoma. This tumor displayed ribbonlike or trabecular patterns, and numerous constituent cells were positive for the argyrophil reaction with Grimelius' stain and serotonin. Electron microscopic features of this tumor confirmed typical carcinoid. There was no merged appearance between both tumors, suggesting collision-type tumor.\r"

  ".W": "Smooth-muscle tumors are an interesting group of tumors that show considerable site specificity in their pathobiology. Recent work has also shown that some previously so-called smooth-muscle tumors were not, in fact, truly leiomyogenic, hence the origin of the more embracing term stromal tumors. The purpose of this retrospective study was to delineate the tumor subsets constituting colorectal stromal tumors, and to determine the histopathologic correlates for biologic aggressiveness for these tumors. The cohort was constituted of 12 patients; the mean follow-up was 6.6 years with a median of 5.0 years. Immunohistochemical evaluations showed tumoral positivity for muscle-specific actin (12 of 12), vimentin (11 of 12), desmin (two of 12), and S100 protein (zero of 12). Electron microscopic examinations corroborated this leiomyogenicity profile (five of five). Semiquantitative histomorphometric analysis showed that tumor size, cellularity, mitoses, and necrosis, in that order, correlated with biologic aggressiveness. The immunohistochemistry results for this cohort of colorectal stromal tumors vindicated the traditional histochemical evaluations in that all tumors showed features of leiomyogenicity. For colorectal smooth-muscle tumors, tumor size appears to be the best predictor for biologic aggressiveness. This study reinforces the concept of site-specificity for smooth-muscle tumors.\r"

We studied 62 stage B and C mucinous carcinomas defined by 60% or greater mucinous component. Sixty of these patients had matched nonmucinous adenocarcinoma controls. Patients with mucinous carcinomas with a residual adenoma had a significantly greater survival than those who did not. Overall, no difference was noted in 5-year survival between patients with mucinous carcinoma and nonmucinous adenocarcinoma (64% each). However, when the stages were considered separately, patients with stage B mucinous carcinoma fared significantly worse and had more local sites of treatment failure. We speculate that patients with stage B mucinous carcinoma may have a worse prognosis owing to the extra-cellular mucin, which may make a complete surgical extirpation more difficult.\r"

The lining cells of the tubules that composed the tumor were negative when tested with anti-mesothelial cell antibodies. Carcinoembryonic antigen was negative, but the secretory component was positive. Serotonin and calcitonin were positive in a few cells. We concluded that a mesothelial origin was unlikely, and it was suggested that the tumor was of an entodermal origin.\r"

  ".U": "91378761\r", 
  ".W": "Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a major constituent of glial cytoplasmic intermediate filaments. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression has been accepted as a marker of astroglial differentiation or origin. However, GFAP expression has been demonstrated in a variety of normal and neoplastic tissues outside the central nervous system, including pleomorphic adenomas, chordomas, bone, and cartilage. It has been postulated that coexpression of GFAP and vimentin in neoplastic myoepithelial cells in pleomorphic adenomas reflects early chondroid differentiation. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in chondromyxoid and chordoid tumors was studied in formaldehyde solution-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 20 pleomorphic adenomas and 10 chordomas by the immunoperoxidase method with the use of commercially available monoclonal (n = 2) and polyclonal (n = 1) antibodies. All pleomorphic adenomas and chordomas demonstrated expression of GFAP with the use of the polyclonal antibody (Biomeda Corp [Foster City, Calif]). Variable expression of GFAP was present in 90% (18/20) and 70% (14/20) of pleomorphic adenomas, and in 20% (2/10) and 0% of chordomas, with the use of the two monoclonal preparations (Dakopatts [Glostrup, Denmark] and BioGenex Laboratories [San Ramon, Calif]), respectively. Normal brain tissue and eight astrocytomas were used as \"controls\" to compare staining intensity and quality between the polyclonal and monoclonal anti-GFAP antibodies. Glial fibrillary acidic protein positivity with the polyclonal antibody was more intense than that with either monoclonal antibody despite similar (congruent) distributions of tumor cell types that were stained in control brain and astrocytoma tissues. The GFAP polyclonal antibody was more frequently immunoreactive than the monoclonal antibodies, particularly in cells that exhibited chondroid differentiation. These findings may have practical application in surgical pathology.\r"

  ".W": "Benign clear cell (\"sugar\") tumor is a rare and most unusual pulmonary neoplasm. Although several reports in the literature have focused on the ultrastructural features of benign clear cell tumor, only a few cases have been formally studied by immunochemistry. Using a broad panel of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, five cases were evaluated. In all five cases, there was diffuse immunoreactivity for cathepsin B. Four cases showed immunoreactivity for HMB-45 and for alpha 1-antitrypsin. By two different sources for antivimentin, there was immunoreactivity in four cases (Biogenex, Dublin, Calif) and in two cases (DAKO, Santa Barbara, Calif), respectively. Additional immunoreactivity was present for S100 protein (three cases), HAM-56 (two cases), factor XIIIA (two cases), and neuron-specific enolase (one case). No case expressed immunoreactivity for keratin (AE 1, AE 3, or CAM 5.2), carcinoembryonic antigen, chromogranin, synaptophysin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, or alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. This immunochemical profile suggests that HMB-45, in combination with a variety of immunostains, may serve to distinguish benign clear cell tumor from other clear cell neoplasms.\r"

We postulate that the spleen was the primary site of the tumor. The unusual histologic features were the presence of both sclerotic and cavernous hemangioma variants in the same tumor and extensive areas of calcium deposits in the tumor. Such atypical clinical and histologic features can pose diagnostic difficulties for both clinicians and pathologists.\r"
