  ".W": "Prenatal diagnosis of epignathus (a teratoma originating in the oropharynx) has been reported previously. However, in many of these cases the neonates succumbed to acute respiratory distress secondary to airway obstruction at the time of birth. We describe a case of antepartum diagnosis of epignathus using ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging as complementary techniques. The ability to accurately define the fetal anomaly permitted us to plan a unique strategy for peripartum management. After cesarean delivery of the infant from the uterus, the umbilical cord was not clamped and the fetoplacental circulation was left undisturbed. A tracheostomy was then performed, after which the umbilical cord was clamped and the infant was stabilized. Several hours later, a debulking procedure was performed in the operating room to remove the tumor from its attachment to the bony palate. Both mother and infant did well postoperatively. The ability to plan and perform a controlled tracheostomy while the infant remained oxygenated and ventilated proved to be lifesaving in this case.\r"

Although more than 300 neonatal cases have been reported, a lack of specific fetal markers has precluded successful antepartum diagnosis. We describe a case of Brachmann-de Lange syndrome identified at 15 weeks' gestation by a low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) value. Sonography revealed a fetus with a posterior nuchal cystic hygroma and early-onset symmetrical intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). The fetal karyotype was 46,XX, but the infant fulfilled the phenotypic criteria of the Brachmann-de Lange syndrome at delivery. The triad of an abnormally low MSAFP value, early-onset symmetrical IUGR, and characteristic ultrasound findings during the second trimester of pregnancy may define adequate criteria for prenatal diagnosis of Brachmann-de Lange syndrome.\r"

No other cases of congenital nephrosis from this group were reported, resulting in an incidence of approximately one in 47,500 in this low-risk population. In both of these cases, similar to other reported cases of congenital nephrosis having MSAFP screening, the protein concentrations were greater than or equal to 10 multiples of the median (MOM). Therefore, in the case of an MSAFP over 10 MOM and a normal ultrasound examination, congenital nephrosis should be included in counseling regarding the possibility of undetected malformations. Furthermore, in the case of a pregnancy with elevated amniotic fluid AFP with negative acetylcholinesterase and normal ultrasound, the possibility of congenital nephrosis should be mentioned, regardless of family history or ancestry. When a pregnancy is terminated because of these biochemical findings, special and immediate attention to the fetal kidneys using electron microscopy is necessary to evaluate properly the possibility of congenital nephrosis.\r"

Sixty-two percent of the seropositive patients had at least one episode of HSV reactivation during the first 100 days after transplant. Other factors that placed patients at increased risk for HSV infection were a pretransplant diagnosis of leukemia, being in remission at the time of transplant, and/or having been conditioned for transplant with chemoradiotherapy.

  ".W": "Florid osseous dysplasia (FOD) is confused in the literature with chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis. Two cases of each condition are presented to demonstrate the differences between them. In FOD, there are multiple lobulated sclerotic masses in several quadrants of the jaws, usually in black females. In some cases, the sclerotic masses are exposed to the oral cavity, resulting in a secondary osteomyelitis. Periapical cemental dysplasia is often found in association with FOD. Chronic diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis is a primary inflammatory condition of the mandible. Patients have cyclic episodes of unilateral pain and swelling. The affected region of the mandible exhibits a diffuse opacity with poorly defined borders. Although women are affected more often than men, black persons are not particularly susceptible.\r"

Unerupted mandibular premolar and molar teeth of a 24-year-old man were surgically exposed, yet the teeth failed to erupt. About a year and a half later, radiographs indicated further enlargement of the follicle of the premolar, and both teeth were subsequently surgically removed. Histologically, the follicles were composed of mature collagenous tissue among which epithelial islands and numerous clusters of calcified bodies were present. Indirect immunofluorescence showed positive staining for type I and type III collagen, which exhibited a sparse distribution, but not for the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen. The hamartomatous nature of the lesions is discussed with emphasis on their histologic resemblance to the WHO type of odontogenic fibroma.\r"

  ".W": "Hyaline ring granuloma (HRG) is a distinct oral entity. In this study, 64 cases from the literature are analyzed and two new cases are reported. The lesions could be classified by location as central hyaline ring granuloma (42%) and peripheral hyaline ring granuloma (53%). Radiographically, a radiolucent area irregularly outlined by well-formed trabeculae of bone was found in central HRG, and a poorly defined erosion at the crest of the alveolar ridge was often found in peripheral HRG. Occasionally, the lesion occurred in the connective tissue wall of cysts (5%). The etiology of this condition is controversial, but most lesions were in edentulous areas and most patients had a history of tooth extraction or other trauma. The majority of cases (83%) occurred in the mandible, usually posterior to the premolar. The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 43 years, and the male/female ratio was 1.9:1. Pain was not a symptom, although local discomfort, such as recurrent swelling and tenderness, was noted in many cases. Hyaline rings with giant cell inclusions are the significant features for histopathologic diagnosis. HRG is treated by curettage or surgical excision, care being taken to remove the entire lesion. The removal of a peripheral HRG in an edentulous jaw should be followed by careful smoothing of the bone surface, since the lesion tends to infiltrate and is not well demarcated. Recurrence, probably due to incomplete excision, is uncommon.\r"

Bacterial suspensions were irradiated directly with ultrasound in simulated root canals, and the viability of bacteria was examined after growth on a blood agar medium under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C for 5 days. The results indicated that ultrasound per se failed to disrupt bacteria but resulted in increases in the viable counts; the former was considered to be because of the lack of cavitation and the latter because of the dispersal effects of acoustic streaming. The 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution demonstrated powerful bactericidal activity.\r"

The marker DCAF, designating levels of bone at the start of radiation, was demonstrated in 92% of irradiated animals, and in 75% of animals in the control group. The uptake of alizarin-complexone determined the level of bone found at the end of irradiation. This marker was demonstrated in 50% of the dogs irradiated and in 75% of the control dogs. Bony trabeculae were found between and at the surface of the HA granules. New generation of bone directly on the HA granule and in the surrounding haversian systems as part of normal bone turnover was demonstrated to take place more than 5 months after implantation of HA.\r"

Among all sisters, TMJD was not associated with age, education, mental impairments, hand coordination, handgrip strength, mobility, or use of walking aids. In 75- to 84-year-old sisters, TMJD was positively associated with self-reported arthritis (p = 0.12), edentulism (p = 0.09), and the presence of complete dentures (p = 0.05), and negatively associated with the number of teeth present (p = 0.05), especially the posterior teeth. These associations were weaker in 85- to 94-year-old sisters.

Most of the patients reported that the test was a valuable service and should be available in the dental office. None of the patients indicated that the tests should not be performed in the dental office. Few patients expressed any significant concern or anxiety about the test either before or after it was completed. Twenty-six percent (24/91) of the patients were found to have a cardiac arrhythmia; however, most of these were nonserious arrhythmias (18/24) and would not have had an impact on planned dental procedures. Six patients were identified with arrhythmias that required medical referral before dental treatment was started.\r"

However, the number of target binding lymphocytes was found to be normal in these precancers. Treatment of effector cells with interferon-alpha resulted in highly elevated active killer cell activity, although no change was observed in target binding lymphocyte counts. This finding could imply that precytotoxic cells that are activated by interferon exist in peripheral blood or that direct recruitment of a new cell population takes place. In addition, altered target lysis kinetics was observed, with interferon-activated killer cells demonstrating a tremendous lytic activation that is completed so quickly that a statistical kinetic analysis could not be accurately done. Because natural killer cell activity is an important effector system in immunosurveillance against tumors, its modulation with interferon may be an exciting clinical possibility in the control of malignant transformation or oral precancers.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine 171 cases completed by third-year dental students and to identify variables that were associated with ledging. A total of 336 canals were examined and tooth number, canal location, working length, the master apical file size, and root canal curvature were recorded. Of 336 canals, 46% were found to have been ledged. Analysis of variance revealed that No. 15 had a significantly higher incidence of ledging. Working lengths and master apical file sizes were not found to be significant variables. The main factor consistently related to the presence of ledges was canal curvature. The number of ledged canals increased significantly after 20 degrees and surpassed the number not ledged after 30 degrees. Multiple regression with the use of the five categories as the dependent variables and ledging as the independent variable resulted in an r = 0.397 and F = 12.216, p less than 0.0001. Curvature was found to have the highest significant t value (7.412) followed by \"teeth\" (2.471), whereas no other categories were identified as being significant. All the determinants for ledging were not identified with this study, and further research is indicated.\r"

The apical two thirds of the canals of 118 upper central incisors, filled with laterally condensed gutta-percha, were sealed with amalgam. Amalgam retrofills were also used to seal the apices of the roots of six teeth that had no other filling in their canals. The effectiveness of both techniques was determined by their ability to inhibit the penetration of methylene blue dye for the periods of 24 hours, 1 week, and 1, 3, and 6 months. At 24 hours both materials showed comparable sealing ability. However, the sealing ability of laterally condensed gutta-percha was significantly better than that of amalgam from the 1-week period until the end of the study. The depth of marginal penetration around both materials increased with time. The amount of the dye penetration increased acutely around amalgam, whereas its increase around gutta-percha was more uniform. At the end of the study, specimens retrofilled with amalgam exhibited total dye penetration that exceeded the full thickness of amalgam (6 mm) and spread into the root canal space. On the other hand, the mean value for marginal penetration of the dye around the laterally condensed gutta-percha was 2.6 mm at the end of the study. The present investigation proved beyond doubt that the use of any thickness of retrograde amalgam to seal the apex, with no other filling within the canal, invites failure.\r"

With both radiographic methods, the results showed no significant difference between left and right side measurements. The mean angulation of the midpoint inclined plane was significantly greater than that of the lateral inclined plane with both techniques. With transcranial radiographs, the angulation values were the same as the direct anatomic measurements despite a 25-degree change in skull orientation required for the radiographic method. In the tomographic study, all measurements corresponded with the anatomic and transcranial measurements except that angulation of the lateral inclined plane differed slightly from the direct anatomic measurement. The results show that both tomography and transcranial radiography are adequate for visualization of the midpoint region. However, tomography is preferable for viewing the lateral aspect of the articular eminence.\r"

When the oral mucosal reaction rates were adjusted for multiple clinical observations within each subject at the same point in time there was no statistically significant (p greater than 0.05) difference between male (0.25) and female (0.28) subjects. In this study population, the order of preference was observed as toothpaste A greater than D greater than B greater than C.

The cyclic axial telescoping mobility, not rigidity, at the nonunion or fracture site is an important requirement for the formation of reparative callus. As we gain more experience with the method, we find ourselves capable of solving increasingly more difficult problems with a level of success rarely, if ever, achieved with more conventional methods.\r"

  ".W": "For the treatment of segmental defects of less than 4 cm, cancellous autografting remains the treatment of choice. Pedicled or free cortical grafts (fibula, ribs, iliac crest) often are not strong enough, particularly when used in the femur. Allografts, especially appealing because of the theoretic unlimited supply, should not be considered for segmental diaphyseal defects because they remain dead spacers, remodelled only very slowly and incompletely, and are often complicated by late infection. The technique of distraction histogenesis used by Putti and Anderson, improved and further differentiated towards corticotomy and fragment transport by Ilizarov, is a further possibility of treating long, segmental bone defects. Already clinical and experimental data clearly show that the effect of distraction histogenesis can be obtained using many different types of external fixators. Therefore, we should use as simple a fixator construction as possible. The standard unilateral sagittal frame we suggest is derived from a two-tube AO fixator using only a few additional elements. The majority of cases with segmental defects and minor additional axial or rotational deformities (which can be corrected primarily) can be treated with such a fixator. The quality of the regenerate may be improved with a motorized, continuous transport system and by better soft-tissue coverage using early flaps. Interface healing is very probably improved by cancellous grafting and internal fixation after the transport period, thus decreasing the fixator time.\r"

  ".W": "This article has presented a theoretical framework for understanding the stress process. The conceptual model of stress specifies relations among situational, cognitive, physiologic, and behavioral factors. Each of these basic components of the model is assumed to be influenced by personality and motivational variables. At the situational level, stress involves the balance or imbalance between situational demands and the resources available to deal with them. However, these situational factors affect the person primarily through the intervening influence of cognitive processes. Among the most important of these processes are appraisal of (1) the situational demands, (2) available personal and social resources, (3) the possible consequences of failure to meet the demands, and (4) the perceived meaning of the consequences. A reciprocal relation exists between cognitive and physiologic processes; the nature of the appraisals influences the level of physiologic arousal that is likely to occur, and arousal in turn influences the ongoing appraisal process through physiologic feedback mechanisms. Finally, the behavioral component of the model includes the person's learned behavior tendencies, task-relevant skills, and social skills. Personality and motivational individual difference variables are important; they influence the kinds of situations to which people expose themselves, how they appraise themselves and the situations, how they react physiologically, and how they customarily respond at the behavioral level. With respect to the consequences of stress, mounting evidence suggests that a significant number of young athletes experience adverse psychological, behavioral, and health-related effects. In fact, because of anticipated stresses, some children decline to participate in the first place. Competitive stress detracts from enjoyment of sports, causes performance impairment, and contributes significantly to the drop-out rate in youth sports. Evidence also indicates that competitive stress can cause loss of sleep and put youngsters at greater risk for sustaining athletic injuries. However, although extremely high levels of stress are experienced by a minority of young athletes, the level of stress elicited by youth sports is generally no greater than that found in other achievement-oriented activities in which children participate. The conceptual model of stress not only provides a framework for identifying sources of stress, but also suggests foci for intervention strategies designed to reduce stress in youth sports. In this article, consideration has been given to prominent situational demands that contribute to competitive stress and to various approaches for counteracting the stress-inducing factors. Specifically, measures may be instituted that decrease situational demands associated with winning and losing, organization and administration of sport programs, coaching roles and relationships, and parent roles and responsibilities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Estimate the percentage of body fat, realizing the errors associated with each method. If a body composition laboratory is available, use that equipment.

The athlete should be given a range of percentage of body fat values measured in other athletes of the same gender and sport. Health and performance should be monitored as the athlete attempts to achieve or maintain body composition in this range. 4.

  ".U": "91016617\r", 
  ".W": "The primary mechanism for maintaining normal body temperature during physical exercise in the heat is the evaporation of sweat. With profuse sweating, water loss far exceeds electrolyte loss. Rigorous exercise in the heat places the athlete at risk for thermoregulatory dysfunction from dehydration. Because children are inherently less efficient thermoregulators than adults, they are at even greater risk for heat illness. The three primary syndromes of heat illness are heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Treatment of heat illness is based on reduction of body temperature and rehydration. Heat stroke is a true medical emergency with a high mortality rate; immediate reduction of body temperature is critical to the survival of these patients. Prevention of heat illness is based on reducing known risk factors. Physical activity should be modified in the face of high ambient temperature and humidity. The athlete should begin exercise well hydrated; frequent consumption of cold water during exercise decreases likelihood of significant dehydration. After exercise, the athlete should continue drinking to replace fluid losses. Clothing should be lightweight; the more skin exposed, the greater the available evaporative surface. A preseason conditioning program, when combined with an 8- to 14-day period of acclimatization, further reduces the risk of heat injury. Although athletes engaged in endurance sports may benefit from drinking carbohydrate/electrolyte-containing solutions, for the majority of young athletes, cold water remains the preferred choice for fluid replacement during exercise. The relatively greater body surface area of young athletes also places them at risk for hypothermia. Special attention should be given when these athletes are competing under cold environmental conditions.\r"

However, the rate of injury is probably rather low, comparable to many youthful activities that are considered safe. Also, the incidence and severity of injury can probably be minimized by adherence to the guidelines presented. Children may be expected to become stronger with appropriate training. Increased strength can enhance their performance in those athletic activities in which strength, power, or speed are required. It may reduce the incidence and severity of overuse injury in sport.

IgG2 and IgG4 concentrations for these 34 children were below the 5th centile for age and sex more frequently than expected (IgG2: chi square 5.8, P less than 0.025; IgG 4: chi square 18.4, P less than 0.0005). The prevalence of IgG2 deficiency or IgG4 deficiency did not differ significantly between those with aIgAd and those with pIgAd. IgG2 concentrations remained below the 5th centile more frequently than expected when retested in 31 children whose pIgAd had resolved (chi square 4.6, P less than 0.05). Children with aIgAd at presentation had IgG1 and IgG2 concentrations above the 95th centile more frequently than expected (IgG1: chi square 19.7, P less than 0.0005; IgG2: chi square 13.5, P less than 0.001) but this was not seen for IgG3 and IgG4 concentrations. Children with pIgAd did not have elevated IgG1 or IgG2 concentrations at presentation. High IgG1 and IgG2 concentrations in aIgAd may be a compensatory mechanism to afford protection from infection or could be part of a selective secondary response to repeated episodes of infection.\r"

Because some patients with subnormal trough concentrations of IgG subclasses remain well, because other patients who have borderline/low normal concentrations of an IgG subclass are abnormally infection-prone and helped by immunoglobulin therapy and because infection proneness in individual patients does not always appear to parallel their IgG subclass concentrations, it is evident that IgG subclass concentrations, while a helpful guide, are not an absolute determinant of the need for immunoglobulin replacement therapy in infection-prone patients. Low IgG subclass concentrations may indicate impaired ability to produce certain \"specific\" antibodies and antibody replacement is likely to be the crucial factor in treatment rather than merely maintaining concentrations of IgG subclasses at particular levels.\r"

In the evaluation of murmurs, the electrocardiogram and echocardiogram are often included. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of these examinations in the initial assessment of heart murmurs in children and adolescents. In a prospective series of 161 patients, the clinical diagnosis of heart murmurs by a pediatric cardiologist was compared with that obtained after electrocardiogram and echocardiogram (two-dimensional, M-mode, Doppler, and color-Doppler). On the basis of the clinical diagnosis the patients were classified as having \"innocent murmur,\" \"pathologic murmur,\" or \"possible pathologic murmur.\" A total of 161 patients (51% males), aged 1 month to 17 years (median 3.2 years), were studied. After electrocardiogram, no diagnosis was changed. After echocardiogram, the clinical diagnosis of innocent murmur in 109 patients changed in 2 to pathologic (small ventricular septal defect 1, small atrial septal defect 1); pathologic murmur in 46 changed to innocent in 3 and possible pathologic in 2; and possible pathologic in 6 changed to innocent in 3 and to pathologic in 2. The clinical examination by an experienced pediatric cardiologist is an accurate means of assessing newly referred patients with murmurs. The clinical examination had a sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 95%, positive predictive value of 88%, and negative predictive value of 98%. The electrocardiogram, unlikely to disclose any unsuspected heart disease, may assist in reaching the lesion-specific diagnosis when there is underlying pathology. Echocardiography, although diagnostic when heart disease is suspected, is unnecessary in pediatric patients with clinically diagnosed innocent heart murmurs.\r"

Although its clinical usefulness in this regard is controversial, phenobarbital treatment has been shown to reduce periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhages after hypertensive insult in newborn beagles. In this study cerebral blood flow values in steady state and during phenylephrine-induced hypertension with and without phenobarbital pretreatment were measured in newborn beagles. At anticonvulsant dosage, phenobarbital sodium decreased mean arterial blood pressure transiently during steady state and significantly reduced total cerebral blood flow during phenylephrine-induced hypertension without reducing mean arterial blood pressure. This phenobarbital sodium effect on cerebral blood flow was not as great in the presence of acidosis, and the initial hypotensive effect of phenobarbital sodium was sustained for a longer period of time during acidosis. Phenobarbital sodium may reduce the incidence of hemorrhages in the newborn brain by providing protection against isolated hemodynamic stresses characterized by acute increases in cerebral blood flow, with or without increased mean arterial blood pressure.\r"

The high-dose hourly regimen resulted in significantly greater improvement in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Furthermore, patients receiving the high dose showed a steady improvement in the FEV1 from the start to the end of the study, whereas FEV1 plateaued after the second dose in the standard-dose group. Although a rise in heart rate and a fall in serum potassium level occurred, neither of these changes nor other side effects were different in the two groups. The high-dose therapy resulted in much higher serum albuterol levels than the standard dose. There was no correlation between the drug levels and side effects or initial and subsequent FEV1. It is concluded that occasional hourly high-dose albuterol therapy should be considered for some pediatric patients with acute asthma of moderate severity, especially those who relapse between doses.\r"

These results were compared with those of an identical survey of 62 of their nonautistic siblings, with the results of four previously published surveys, and with normative data. No potentially pathologic factor or group of factors occurred significantly more frequently among the autistic patients. Also, previous observations of significant differences in the occurrence of certain factors in the histories single vs multiple siblings with autism were not confirmed, with the exception of increased viral-type illness during gestation in single-incidence cases. Thus, the etiology of the brain pathology that characteristically disrupts normal development and produces the syndrome of autism remains obscure. Other data from the epidemiologic survey, however, suggest that the role of genetic factors needs to be explored further.\r"

Mean intake of total fat, saturated fat, and polyunsaturated fat as percent of calories was 35.6%, 13.4%, and 6.6%, respectively. Among all subjects, 17% consumed diets containing less than 30% of calories from fat, 34% consumed greater than or equal to 38% of calories from fat, 7% consumed less than 10% of calories from saturated fatty acids, and greater than 97% ate less than 300 mg of cholesterol per day. While intake of calories, sodium, and beta-carotene per 1000 kcal was higher in subjects consuming higher fat diets, intake of other micronutrients was either higher among those eating low-fat diets or did not differ by level of fat intake. Differences were seen in the amount of saturated fat and cholesterol that individual food sources contributed to the diets of subjects eating high and low fat diets. These cross-sectional data show that a substantial proportion of children and adolescents in this population are consuming diets low in fat and cholesterol without systematic differences in intake of other nutrients, suggesting that current dietary guidelines regarding fat intake are attainable within the current food use pattern of healthy, school-aged children and adolescents.\r"

One month after a single vaccination, the anti-H influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide antibody concentration rose from a geometric mean prevaccination level of 0.20 microgram/mL to 13.77 micrograms/mL. Of these infants, 99% had a postvaccination level greater than or equal to 1.00 microgram/mL, a level associated with long-term protection. The immune response was long-lived: all of the children who were monitored 17 to 27 months after vaccination had concentrations greater than or equal to 1.00 microgram/mL. The anti-H influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide antibody generated was predominantly of the IgG isotype and IgG1 subclass. The immune sera had bactericidal activity in vitro and conferred passive protection in the infant rat meningitis model.\r"

The 193 SIDS cases identified in the cohort were analyzed with 1930 controls randomly selected from infants who survived the first year of life. After adjustment for maternal age, infants born to mothers who smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day and who were anemic (hematocrit less than 30%) during pregnancy were at a much higher risk of SIDS than infants born to mothers who did not smoke and were not anemic (odds ratio = 4.0; 95% confidence limits, 2.1 and 7.4). Smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day vs none increased the risk of SIDS by 70% among women with hematocrit at or above 30% but increased risk threefold among women with hematocrit below 30%. After adjustment for more potential confounders in a logistic regression model, the effect of smoking on SIDS continued to increase with lower levels of hematocrit during pregnancy. Birth weight accounted for very little of these associations. Low hematocrit was not a risk factor for SIDS among nonsmokers but became an important predictor among heavy smokers. These findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that chronic fetal hypoxia may predispose to SIDS, possibly by impairing the normal development of the fetal central nervous system.\r"

By the age of 10 years, 7.5% of children had chronic or recurrent eczema. There were clear and consistent associations between the diversity of the child's diet during the first 4 months and risks of eczema. Even when due allowance was made for a range of confounding factors--including parental atopic illness, atopic illness in siblings, the child's early milk diet, and family social background--children exposed to four or more different types of solid food before 4 months had risks of recurrent or chronic eczema that were 2.9 times those of children who were not exposed to early solid feeding. It is concluded that early exposure to a diet diverse in potential food antigens may act to predispose susceptible children to recurrent or chronic childhood eczema.\r"

Major impediments identified were curriculum time constraints (86% medical student level, 68% resident level) and the lack of a qualified instructor (55% medical student level, 50% resident level).

In the remainder of the cases, definitively ruling out infection allowed the confident trial of a course of steroids in an attempt to treat bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Unlike older patients, the definitive diagnosis of no infection in the premature neonate is just as informative as the diagnosis of an infection. Used judiciously, open lung biopsy can be performed in the premature infant with acceptable morbidity and mortality.\r"

Neonates at less than 6 hours of age with a diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome were eligible. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 100 mg/kg of bovine surfactant or air placebo. Neonates in the multiple-dose group were eligible to receive up to three additional doses as indicated. Neonates in both surfactant groups showed a positive response to treatment, with marked improvement in oxygenation by 10 minutes postinstillation (P less than .0001). Both surfactant groups had better oxygenation than control subjects at lower ventilatory parameters over the first 24 hours. A deterioration in oxygenation and ventilatory requirements was seen in both treatment groups starting 6 to 12 hours after the first dose. The deterioration in oxygenation could be minimized by the use of multiple doses; however, extra doses had no effect on diminishing ventilatory requirements or time to extubation. It is concluded that surfactant therapy at less than 6 hours of age is effective in acutely reducing oxygen and ventilatory requirements in neonates of 30 to 36 weeks' gestation with respiratory distress syndrome. It appears that multiple doses of surfactant have a greater effect on sustaining improvements in oxygenation than on ventilatory requirements. Further study is required to determine optimal dosage and retreatment strategy.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 11 cases of red man syndrome collected among 650 children who had received vancomycin in our hospital between 1986 and 1988 (estimated prevalence 1.6%) were retrospectively analyzed. These 11 children were compared with 11 age-matched children who received vancomycin in whom red man syndrome did not develop. Of the patients with red man syndrome, 73%, and of the patients with no reaction, 45.4% received vancomycin for penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis-positive cultures, or because of history of penicillin allergy. No difference was observed in the dose per kilogram given to both groups (12.9 +/- 3.5 mg/kg per dose in those with red man syndrome vs 12.3 +/- 6.9 mg/kg per dose in control children. The duration (mean +/- standard deviation) of vancomycin infusion was 45.9 +/- 16.7 minutes (range 10 to 90 minutes) in patients with red man syndrome and 54.5 +/- 7.6 minutes (range 45 to 65 minutes) in the control group (P = .07). In the 5 children with red man syndrome rechallenged with vancomycin, slower infusion rates prevented or reduced the syndrome, which emphasized the fact that the rate of administration is the important determinant of red man syndrome in susceptible cases. Clinically, the syndrome developed at the end of the infusion in most patients, but appeared as early as 15 minutes after initiation of the infusion. It was mostly manifested as a flushed, erythematous rash on the face, neck, and around the ears. Less frequently, the rash was distributed all over the body. Pruritus was usually localized to the upper trunk but was also generalized (2 of 11 children).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There was a high incidence of maternal psychiatric histories, marital difficulties, and Munchhausen syndrome in the mothers themselves. Seventy-one percent of the children in the families were known to be victims of MSBP; four of these children (31%) died. Multiple-child MSBP may reflect more significant maternal psychopathology than found in other cases of MSBP, or it may indicate the deteriorating consequences to the mother and other children in the family if this syndrome is not identified with the first child and effective interventions made.\r"

  ".W": "Predictors of outcome in pediatric submersion victims treated by Seattle and King County's prehospital emergency services were studied. Victims less than 20 years old were identified from hospital admissions and paramedic and medical examiners' reports. The proportion of fatal or severe outcomes in patients were compared with various risk factors. Of 135 patients, 45 died and 5 had severe neurologic impairment. A subset of 38 victims found in cardiopulmonary arrest had a 32% survival rate, with 67% of survivors unimpaired or only mildly impaired. The two risk factors that occurred most commonly in victims who died or were severely impaired were submersion duration greater than 9 minutes (28 patients) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration longer than 25 minutes (20 patients). Both factors were ascertained in the prehospital phase of care. Submersion duration was associated with a steadily increasing risk of severe or fatal outcomes: 10% risk (7/67) for 0 to 5 minutes, 56% risk (5/9) for 6 to 9 minutes, 88% risk (21/25) for 10 to 25 minutes, 100% risk (4/4) for greater than 25 minutes. None of 20 children receiving greater than 25 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation escaped death or severe neurologic impairment. Our rates for saving all victims, particularly victims in cardiopulmonary arrest, are considerably higher than has been reported before the children. Prompt prehospital advanced cardiac life support is the most effective means of medical intervention for the pediatric submersion victim. Prehospital information provided the most valuable predictors of outcome.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the impact of renal transplantation on subsequent development of children with chronic renal failure, 37 children undergoing primary renal transplantation at or before 30 months of age whose allograft functioned for at least 1 year were prospectively studied. Psychometric tests were performed an average of 4 months before transplantation; reevaluation was done an average of 14 months after surgery. Comparison of individual pretransplantation and posttransplantation mental development scores in 33 patients, assessed by either Bayley Mental Development Index or Stanford-Binet Intelligence Quotient, revealed an average increase of 12.6 (P less than .001). After transplantation, there was a significant improvement in mental performance in 12 of 18 patients (P less than .02) from the range of mild delay (Mental Development Index or Stanford-Binet IQ score = 50 to 69) to the range of normal mental development (greater than or equal to 70). The Bayley Psychomotor Development Index scores were frequently lower than Mental Development Index scores and also increased an average of 14.4 (P less than .01) after transplantation in all 12 patients with paired data. Significant individual improvement in occipital-frontal circumference standard deviation score (P less than .001) was noted in 24 children after transplantation. It is concluded that successful renal transplantation in young children with chronic renal failure is often associated with significant improvements in cognitive and psychomotor function, as well as improved cephalic growth.\r"

Children who had ingested other soy formulas that had an adequate chloride content were also found and matched to the exposed children by sex, race, birth weight, the age of the child, the mixed feeding status of the child, and maternal education. One hundred seventy-one of the exposed children and 261 soy control children were given a battery of psychologic tests in their homes to determine whether there had been any effect on intellectual development as a result of exposure to the chloride-deficient formulas. There were no differences in scores between the groups on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, the Boston Naming Test, the Rey-Osterrieth Test, or the FAS Verbal Fluency Test. There was no correlation between duration of exclusive exposure to the chloride-deficient formulas and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised Full-Scale IQ Score (Pearson product-moment r = -.0825, P = .28). These results cannot be extrapolated to exposed children with documented hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. It is concluded that in children without documented evidence of hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, exposure to the chloride-deficient formulas Neo-Mull-Soy or Cho-Free during infancy has not resulted in any long-term adverse effects on cognitive development.\r"

Pediatrics. 1989; 83:323-331); 44 children with febrile convulsions lasting more than 30 minutes were followed for a mean of 28 months (range 4 to 72). Thirty children were followed prospectively. Children with prior afebrile seizures or evidence of acute central nervous system infection were excluded. Nine (20%) children had prior neurological deficits. The duration of the febrile seizure was 0.5 to 1 hour in 41 cases (85%), 1 to 2 hours in 5 (10%), and greater than 2 hours in 2 children (5%). No child died or developed new neurological deficits following the seizures. The risk of recurrent seizures was increased, but only in the group with prior neurological abnormality. Six (66%) of these children had subsequent febrile seizures compared with 12 (34%) of the normal children (P = .08). Three (33%) had recurrent febrile status epilepticus compared with only 1 (3%) normal child (P = .023). The 2 children in the prospective arm of the study with recurrent febrile status epilepticus were both neurologically abnormal (P = .035). All 3 of the children who subsequently had afebrile seizures (2 prospective) were neurologically abnormal (P = .006 overall, P = .035 for prospective only). It is concluded that the occurrence of febrile status epilepticus in a neurologically impaired child is a risk factor for subsequent febrile as well as afebrile seizures. The occurrence of febrile status epilepticus in an otherwise normal child does not significantly increase the risk for subsequent febrile (brief or prolonged) or afebrile seizures in the first few years following the episode.\r"

No patient required admission to the hospital. Only one patient required another course of rapid intravenous rehydration and subsequently improved without hospitalization. Although all our patients experienced vomiting before treatment, 65% had no vomiting after treatment. Rapid intravenous rehydration is an effective treatment, for children with mild to moderate dehydration secondary to presumed viral gastroenteritis, that obviates the need for hospitalization.\r"

A retrospective review was conducted at two children's hospitals to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients with Hib meningitis whose spinal fluid had a normal total white blood cell count, normal chemistries, and negative Gram stain, but subsequent growth of Hib in culture. Of 379 cases of Hib meningitis, two had completely normal CSF, and two had CSF containing small numbers of polymorphonuclear cells as the sole abnormality. In three of the four cases, the duration of symptoms was less than 24 hours, and appropriate therapy was significantly delayed because of benign-appearing CSF. Normal CSF cell counts, chemistries, and Gram stain do not exclude the possibility of bacterial meningitis, and one should remain suspicious when a child has clinical findings suggesting meningitis.\r"

  ".U": "91017113\r", 
  ".W": "Emergency intubations are done for a variety of reasons in the emergency department (ED). In some patients, a rapid, controlled induction of anesthesia is useful to facilitate intubation and to reduce the complications of intubation. This is referred to a rapid sequence induction (RSI) in the anesthesia literature. Atropine, thiopental, fentanyl, diazepam, ketamine, vecuronium, succinylcholine, other drugs and their applications for RSI are described. The purpose of this article is to describe the use of RSI in the airway management of ED patients. Nineteen pediatric patients requiring emergency intubation were intubated using RSI with vecuronium and thiopental. Actual intubation difficulty using RSI was significantly less than the anticipated intubation difficulty without RSI. There were no complications caused by intubation or RSI that had a significant impact on patient outcome. We feel that a sedative in combination with vecuronium represents the most optimal means of achieving RSI in the ED setting. Although the induction of general anesthesia is best done by anesthesiologists, emergency physicians are often the most experienced physicians immediately available to manage an airway in a critical emergency. An objective protocol such as that described will make it easier for emergency physicians to perform this procedure when needed.\r"

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy should be undertaken when response to therapy is incomplete, symptoms recur quickly, or dyspeptic symptoms present for the first time in a patient older than age 50. When gastric ulcers are diagnosed radiographically, endoscopy and biopsy at multiple sites should be done to exclude malignant disease. Intractable duodenal ulcers may necessitate endoscopic biopsy of antral and duodenal mucosa to rule out an associated Helicobacter pylori infection, which may modify therapeutic approaches. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is rare but should be suspected when ulcer disease presents atypically or aggressively or in families. Diagnosis is not difficult to confirm.\r"

This is true despite the drugs' varied mechanisms of action, and this observation has caused investigators to shift their focus from aggressive to defensive factors when studying ulcer pathogenesis. Patients with a healed ulcer are always at risk for recurrence, and guidelines are available for management of these patients. Ulcer prevention becomes a crucial issue in intensive care units where critically ill patients have many known risk factors. Maintaining a gastric pH above 4.0 appears to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with such stress-induced ulcers. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increases ulcer risk and complications in the elderly, in women with rheumatoid arthritis, and in smokers and abusers of alcohol. Prophylaxis with the synthetic prostaglandin analogue misoprostol (Cytotec) appears to reduce this risk.\r"

The successful management of trauma demands that immediately life-threatening problems receive top priority and that patients be continuously reexamined and problems reprioritized as conditions change. Finally, it is imperative that appropriate surgical evaluation and treatment be undertaken as soon as possible. Trauma patients should not be allowed to languish or undergo extensive examination in a hospital lacking surgical or other specialists trained to treat the problems identified. Transfer to another facility, whether for specialized diagnostic tests or for evaluation and treatment by surgical specialists, should be accomplished as quickly as possible.\r"

The primary structure was deduced from the DNA sequence analysis. The protein is 713 residues long, with a 19-amino acid signal peptide. The mRNA was expressed in 293-S and NIH 3T3 cells, yielding a glycoprotein (i) that binds amiloride and amiloride analogs with affinities similar to the amiloride receptor associated with the apical Na+ channel in pig kidney membranes and (ii) that is immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies raised against pig kidney amiloride-binding protein.\r"

This verifies the earlier conclusion, based on less-direct evidence, that this thioether derivative of cysteine is a component of naturally occurring proteins. The finding of this modified amino acid as a product of hydrazinolysis indicates that it is a carboxyl-terminal amino acid and that it is not carboxyl-methylated.\r"

When the walls of vegetative cells are removed with the enzyme gamete autolysin (g-lysin), they regenerate a matrix within 3-4 hr. In vitro translation of mRNAs isolated from g-lysin-treated cells showed significant increases and decreases in abundance of several mRNAs encoding proline-rich polypeptides. Because the population of up-regulated mRNAs is likely to include species encoding cell wall components, expression of genes for two outer wall HRGPs (GP1 and GP2) was analyzed during wall regeneration by using cDNAs isolated from a C. reinhardtii lambda gt11 library. Transcripts encoding GP1 and GP2 were elevated severalfold within the first hour or regeneration, suggesting that upregulation of HRGP mRNAs is a primary response to cell wall removal by g-lysin. Cell wall regeneration in Chlamydomonas provides an accessible system to study HRGP gene expression during matrix development.\r"

One clone identified by this procedure corresponded to a 1.4-kilobase mRNA, designated NB-1, whose expression was decreased greater than 50-fold in HMECs tumorigenically transformed in vitro after exposure to benzo[a]pyrene and Kirsten sarcoma virus. Sequence analysis of NB-1 cDNA revealed an open reading frame with a high degree of homology to calmodulin. NB-1 expression could be demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction amplification in normal breast, prostate, cervix, and epidermal tissues. The presence of NB-1 transcripts was variable in primary breast carcinoma tissues and undetectable in tumor-derived cell lines of breast, prostate, or other origins. NB-1 mRNA expression could be down-regulated in cultured HMECs by exposure to reconstituted extracellular matrix material, while exposure to transforming growth factor type beta increased its relative abundance. The protein encoded by NB-1 may have Ca2+ binding properties and perform functions similar to those of authentic calmodulin. Its possible roles in differentiation and/or suppression of tumorigenicity in epithelial tissues remain to be examined.\r"

The rat liver protein was cleaved with cyanogen bromide or trypsin and 17 of the resulting peptides were sequenced. DNA primers were generated from 3 peptides that had homology to sequences of the conserved catalytic domain of protein kinases. These primers were used in the polymerase chain reaction to obtain a 0.4-kilobase DNA fragment. This fragment was either radioactively labeled and hybridized to Northern blots of poly(A)+ mRNA or used to screen a rat liver cDNA library. Northern blot analysis revealed four transcripts of 2.5, 3.2, 4.0, and 6.0 kilobases, and five S6 kinase clones were obtained by screening the library. Only two of the clones, which were identical, encoded a full-length protein. This protein had a molecular weight of 56,160, which correlated closely to that of the dephosphorylated kinase determined by SDS/PAGE. The catalytic domain of the kinase resembles that of other serine/threonine kinases belonging to the second messenger subfamily of protein kinases.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of an amino acid other than aspartic acid at position 57 of the HLA-DQ beta chain (non-Asp-57) is highly associated with susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), whereas an aspartic acid at this position (Asp-57) appears to confer resistance to the disease. We hypothesize that the 30-fold difference in IDDM incidence across racial groups and countries is related to variability in the frequency of these alleles. Diabetic and nondiabetic individuals were evaluated in five populations, including those at low, moderate, and high risk. HLA-DQ beta genotype distributions among the IDDM case groups were markedly different (P less than 0.001), as were those among nondiabetic controls (P less than 0.001). Non-Asp-57 alleles were significantly associated with IDDM in all areas; population-specific odds ratios for non-Asp-57 homozygotes relative to Asp-57 homozygotes ranged from 14 to 111. Relative risk information from the case-control study and population incidence data were combined to estimate genotype-specific incidence rates for the Allegheny County, PA, Caucasians. These rates were used to predict the overall incidence rates in the remaining populations, which were within the 95% confidence intervals of the actual rates established from incidence registries. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that population variation in the distribution of non-Asp-57 alleles may explain much of the geographic variation in IDDM incidence.\r"

  ".U": "91017508\r", 
  ".W": "A 10-day course with ART-18, a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the rat interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R), prolongs the survival of (LEW x BN)F1 cardiac allografts in LEW recipients to approximately 3 weeks (acute rejection = 8 days, P less than 0.001). We examined host responses against ART-18 idiotype (Id) and mouse immunoglobulin in recipients immunomodulated with ART-18 mAb. Treatment with ART-18 elicited high titers of anti-Id antibodies 14 days after transplantation. However, naive rats given ART-18 before transplantation showed strong anti-Id responses as early as day 4 after engraftment, coinciding with abrogation of the treatment effect (graft survival, approximately 10 days). Preimmunization with irrelevant mouse IgG, which elicited high titers of anti-IgG, did not influence the efficacy of ART-18 upon graft survival (17 days). The use of cyclosporin A (CsA) in conjunction with ART-18 prior to transplantation suppressed the anti-Id response and led to dramatic graft prolongation (greater than 58 days), with two of five grafts surviving indefinitely. This striking effect of CsA plus ART-18 pretreatment did not depend upon CsA per se, as grafts were rejected within 12 days in animals pretreated with CsA alone; in both groups CsA trough levels were comparable. Moreover, administration of CsA before transplantation in concert with control IgG (instead of ART-18) prompted rejection within 2-4 weeks. Thus, discrete interaction(s) between anti-IL-2R mAb and CsA prior to engraftment induces partial host unresponsiveness/tolerance to anti-IL-2R mAb treatment following transplantation and suppresses the neutralizing anti-Id responses, which results in long-term/permanent graft acceptance. This study provides a strategy to overcome the anti-Id response mounted by graft recipients that otherwise limits the efficacy of anti-IL-2R mAb treatment.\r"

The TNF receptor contains four cysteine-rich subdomains in the extracellular portion. Mammalian cells transfected with the entire TNF receptor cDNA bind radiolabeled TNF alpha with an affinity of 2.5 x 10(-9) M.

Cultures labeled with [3H]glycerol and exposed to proliferative concentrations of crocidolite asbestos demonstrated significant elevations in [3H]diacylglycerol. In contrast, crocidolite-exposed cells labeled with [3H]myristic acid or [3H]choline did not display elevated production of [3H]diacylglycerol or release of [3H]choline metabolites--i.e., evidence of phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis. The soluble tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate catalyzed both of these changes. myo-[3H]Inositol-labeled cells exposed as briefly as 10 min to mitogenic concentrations of crocidolite demonstrated elevations in [3H]inositol mono-, tris-, and terakisphosphates, phenomena indicating turnover of inositol phospholipids.

We have used reporter plasmids containing DNA fragments of the 5' flanking region of the LMP gene in cotransfection experiments to analyze the effect of EBNA2 on the activity of the LMP promoter. The results show that the LMP promoter is controlled by positive and negative transcription elements in a DNA fragment that contains the LMP transcription initiation site and 634 base pairs of upstream sequences. The promoter is activated by EBNA2. The region between position -54 and +40 relative to the mRNA cap site contains a positive transcription element that is constitutively active in DG75 cells and independent of EBNA2. The -106 to -54 region contains a negative regulatory element that prevents adjacent positive elements from functioning in the absence of EBNA2. Regulatory sequences between -324 and -144 participate in maintaining a high level of transcription of the LMP promoter after induction with EBNA2. The regulatory elements in the -634 to -54 promoter region have the characteristics of an inducible enhancer, including orientation independence and ability to regulate a heterologous promoter.\r"

In particular, we find that on average the helical periodicity of DNA in this nucleosome is 10.18 +/- 0.05 base pairs per turn. The same DNA, when bound to a calcium phosphate surface, has a periodicity of 10.49 +/- 0.05 base pairs per turn, similar to that of random sequence DNA. Modulations in minor groove width within the naked DNA detected by the hydroxyl radical are maintained and exaggerated in nucleosomal DNA.

The proliferative response can be blocked by preventing the pHin increase; yet, the proliferative response cannot be stimulated by artificially raising pHin with weak bases or high medium pH. These observations support the hypothesis that optimal pHin is a necessary, but not sufficient, component of the proliferative-response sequence. This hypothesis has recently been challenged by the observation that transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with yeast H(+)-ATPase renders them tumorigenic. Although previous measurements indicated that these transfected cells maintain a higher pHin in the absence of HCO3-, whether H(+)-ATPase transfection raised the pHin under physiologically relevant conditions was not known. The current report shows that these transfected cells do maintain a higher pHin than control cells in the presence of HCO3-, supporting the possibility that elevated pHin is a proliferative trigger in situ. We also show that these cells are serum-independent for growth and that they glycolyze much more rapidly than phenotypically normal cells.\r"

Using a biotin-based targeting assay, we found that GPI-anchored gD-1 was sorted intracellularly and delivered directly to the apical surface. Endocytosis of GPI-anchored gD-1 occurred slowly and preferentially from the apical domain, while transcytosis of the basolateral fraction did not occur at a significant rate (incompatible with being a precursor to the apical pool). Prevention of tight junction formation by incubation in medium with micromolar Ca2+ resulted in expression of GPI-anchored gD-1 on the free surface, but not on the attached surface of the cell. Our results indicate that the apical polarity of a GPI-anchored protein is generated by vectorial delivery to the apical membrane, where its distribution is maintained by slow endocytosis and by a retention system not necessarily involving the tight junction.\r"

Two related enzymes, chitin synthase I and chitin synthase II (UDP-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose:chitin 4-beta-acetamidodeoxyglucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.16), have been identified and their structural genes, CHS1 and CHS2, respectively, have been cloned and sequenced. Gene disruption experiments led to the conclusion that CHS2 is essential for cell division [Silverman, S.J., Sburlati, A., Slater, M.L. & Cabib, E. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 4735-4739], whereas CHS1 is not. We repeated the disruption of CHS2 and determined that it is not essential for vegetative growth. The viability of chs1::HIS3 chs2::TRP1 spores is influenced by strain background and germination conditions. The double disruption mutant has no detectable chitin deficiency in vivo, as judged by quantitative assay and by staining cells with Calcofluor. Assay of membrane preparations from the double disruption mutant indicates the presence of chitin synthetic activity. Unlike the CHS gene products, this third activity is not stimulated by trypsin. Characterization of the double disruption mutant revealed abnormalities in morphology and nuclear migration.\r"

In this study, mouse bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells were subdivided into Rh-123lo, Rh-123med, and Rh-123hi populations. The Rh-123lo (resting) population was significantly enriched in cells with a higher proliferative potential compared to the Rh-123hi (activated) population. The resting population exhibited a 20-fold greater ability to differentiate into splenic colony-forming units (CFU-S) relative to the activated population, whereas the activated population contained about 4-fold more day 13 CFU-S on primary transfer relative to the resting population. The two populations produced morphologically distinct splenic colonies; however, the frequency and morphology of in vitro colonies were very similar. Only the resting population provided sufficient stem cells to transfer long-term hematopoietic repopulation to secondary recipient animals after lethal irradiation. On a single cell level, the resting and activated populations exhibited an equivalent ability to differentiate into lymphoid and myeloid progeny. These observations provide further insight into the heterogeneous nature of CFU-S and directly demonstrate that multipotent hematopoietic stem cells are heterogeneous with regard to their clonogenic capacities.\r"

After 1-5 years of follow-up, 13 patients of group A had essentially retained their initial status (asymptomatics); the 22 others had suffered clinical or immunological deterioration (progressors). Frozen cells were thawed and submitted to lethal gamma-irradiation in vitro (4500 rads; 1 rad = 0.01 Gy) before they were cultured with normal phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes to determine radiation-resistant HIV expression ex vivo (R-HEV). HIV antigenemia correlated with R-HEV values in 142 samples (r = 0.92, P less than 0.001) but was a less sensitive predictor of disease than R-HEV. R-HEV was detected in all specimens from patients with major AIDS-related illnesses or HIV-associated CD4 lymphopenia. In 77% of the progressors from group A, R-HEV detection preceded the onset of AIDS-associated disease or CD4 lymphopenia by 1 year (average). Conversely, R-HEV was low or was not detected in 36 sequential specimens from the 13 patients who remained asymptomatic over the following 2-5 years. Thus, persistently low HIV expression in vivo predicted a nondiseased state, whereas higher HIV expression levels seemed necessary for disease to occur. These data indicate that R-HEV is related to productive HIV infection in vivo, the latter acting as a determinant of AIDS-related illnesses. In view of this, measurement of HIV expression levels in the patient should be useful in antiviral efficacy trials.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II, or hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity with a positive acidified-serum-lysis test (HEMPAS), is a genetic anemia in humans inherited by an autosomally recessive mode. The enzyme defect in most HEMPAS patients has previously been proposed as a lowered activity of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II, resulting in a lack of polylactosamine on proteins and leading to the accumulation of polylactosaminyl lipids. A recent HEMPAS case, G.C., has now been analyzed by cell-surface labeling, fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry of glycopeptides, and activity assay of glycosylation enzymes. Significantly decreased glycosylation of polylactosaminoglycan proteins and incompletely processed asparagine-linked oligosaccharides were detected in the erythrocyte membranes of G.C. In contrast to the earlier studied HEMPAS cases, G.C. cells are normal in N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II activity but are low in alpha-mannosidase II (alpha-ManII) activity. Northern (RNA) analysis of poly(A)+ mRNA from normal, G.C., and other unrelated HEMPAS cells all showed double bands at the 7.6-kilobase position, detected by an alpha-ManII cDNA probe, but expression of these bands in G.C. cells was substantially reduced (less than 10% of normal). In Southern analysis of G.C. and normal genomic DNA, the restriction fragment patterns detected by the alpha-ManII cDNA probe were indistinguishable. These results suggest that G.C. cells contain a mutation in alpha-ManII-encoding gene that results in inefficient expression of alpha-ManII mRNA, either through reduced transcription or message instability. This report demonstrates that HEMPAS is caused by a defective gene encoding an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides.\r"

Thus, tAg may, in part, be viewed as a \"portable\" copy of a TAg functional domain.\r"

Contraction was initiated by photohydrolysis of caged ATP and the time dependence of shortening was monitored by an inverted microscope equipped with a video camera. Antibody-treated myofibrils undergo unloaded shortening in a fast phase with initial rates and half-times comparable to control (untreated) myofibrils, despite a marked reduction in the isometric force of skinned muscle fibers in the presence of the antibodies. In antibody-treated myofibrils, this process is followed by a much slower phase of contraction, terminating in elongated structures with well-defined sarcomere spacings (approximately 1 micron) in contrast to the supercontracted globular state of control myofibrils. These results suggest that although the unloaded shortening of myofibrils (and in vitro motility of actin filaments over immobilized myosin heads) can be powered by myosin heads, the subfragment-2 region as well as the myosin head contributes to force production in actively contracting muscle.\r"

  ".W": "During our investigations into the physiological role of c-src tyrosine kinase in normal cells, we found that clonal transfectants of C3H10T1/2 murine fibroblasts overexpressing chicken c-src exhibited strikingly elevated levels of cAMP accumulation in response to adrenergic stimulation as compared to control cells. Enhanced cAMP accumulations were detected when cells were treated with the beta-agonists, epinephrine, isoproterenol, or terbutaline and were blocked by treatment with the beta-specific antagonist propranolol, indicating action through beta-adrenergic receptors. The hyperresponsiveness was not observed in cells overexpressing kinase-defective c-src. No differences in basal levels of cAMP, agonist concentration dependence, or kinetics of cAMP accumulation were detected between cells containing elevated levels of wild-type or kinase-defective c-src protein and control cells. To determine if the degree of c-src overexpression could influence the response, multiple clones, transfected with DNA encoding genes for wild-type or kinase-defective c-src plus neomycin resistance or neomycin resistance alone, were derived in parallel and assayed for the amounts of c-src protein produced and the levels of cAMP accumulated in response to epinephrine. Only clones with abundant wild-type c-src protein (greater than 10-fold above endogenous) exhibited enhanced cAMP accumulation, averaging 3.3-fold above control cells. We conclude, therefore, that the enhanced degree of cAMP accumulation in cells overexpressing c-src is dependent upon activation of beta-adrenergic receptors and upon a threshold level of pp60c-src that retains full tyrosine kinase activity.\r"

Elevated expression of p58 in these cells resulted in prolonged late telophase and early G1 phase of the cell cycle. These p58 overexpressors showed a significantly increased frequency of tubulin midbodies as well as significant increases in mitotic abnormalities. Thus, proper regulation of p58 protein kinase is essential for normal cell cycle progression in these cells.\r"

Noninfectious virus particles produced in the presence of the drug contained gag precursors and were morphologically immature. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in a continuous cell line, U-75875 completely blocked HIV replication; in the latter case, no spread occurred over a period of 4 weeks. U-75875, on a molar basis, was as potent as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine in blocking HIV-1 replication in human lymphocytes and also inhibited HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus proteases, demonstrating that it has broad activity.

The cDNA had an open reading frame encoding 662 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 75,590. Three independent clones revealed minor heterogeneities in their DNA sequences. Thus, in three positions of the deduced amino acid sequence, there is a choice between two different amino acids. The deduced sequence from the clone plT3 showed 65% identity with human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase and 42% identity with human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase. The 12-lipoxygenase cDNA recognized a 3.0-kilobase mRNA species in platelets and human erythroleukemia cells (HEL cells). Phorbol 12-tetradecanoyl 13-acetate induced megakaryocytic differentiation of HEL cells and 12-lipoxygenase activity and increased mRNA for 12-lipoxygenase. The identity of the cloned 12-lipoxygenase was assured by expression in a mammalian cell line (COS cells). Human platelet 12-lipoxygenase has been difficult to purify to homogeneity. The cloning of this cDNA will increase the possibilities to elucidate the structure and function of this enzyme.\r"

In quail embryos of day 2-5, Quox-7 transcripts were found essentially in the ventral mesenchyme (neural crest-derived mesectoderm of the face and hypobranchial structures, somatopleure, and limbs) and also in a narrow dorsomedial band of cells of the superficial ectoderm and neural tube.

In contrast, the incidence, onset, and intensity of the B-cell response to produce anti-T-antigen autoantibodies vary considerably with genetic background. Thus the initial attraction of lymphocytes to the cells synthesizing a non-self antigen can be separated from the activation of a B-cell response against it. Haplotypes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) differentially influence the character of the autoimmune response, with H-2d and H-2k conferring a high incidence of humoral autoimmunity. Additional non-MHC linked genes are also implicated in control of the B-cell response.\r"

  ".W": "Visna virus is an ungulate lentivirus that is distantly related to the primate lentiviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Replication of HIV-1 and of other complex primate retroviruses, including human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), requires the expression in trans of a virally encoded post-transcriptional activator of viral structural gene expression termed Rev (HIV-1) or Rex (HTLV-I). We demonstrate that the previously defined L open reading frame of visna virus encodes a protein, here termed Rev-V, that is required for the cytoplasmic expression of the incompletely spliced RNA that encodes the viral envelope protein. Transactivation by Rev-V was shown to require a cis-acting target sequence that coincides with a predicted RNA secondary structure located within the visna virus env gene. However, Rev-V was unable to function by using the structurally similar RNA target sequences previously defined for Rev or Rex and, therefore, displays a distinct sequence specificity. Remarkably, substitution of this visna virus target sequence in place of the HIV-1 Rev response element permitted the Rev-V protein to efficiently rescue the expression of HIV-1 structural proteins, including Gag, from a Rev- proviral clone. These results suggest that the post-transcriptional regulation of viral structural gene expression may be a characteristic feature of complex retroviruses.\r"

We previously developed a serum-free, hormonally defined medium permissive for the adipose differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells. When 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were maintained in serum-free medium without insulin but with growth hormone (2 nM), typical adipose differentiation did not occur. However, we found that growth hormone induced a state of cellular refractoriness to the mitogenic stimulus of fetal bovine serum as assayed by de novo DNA synthesis. The mitogen refractory condition (i.e., the antimitogenic state) was time-dependent (half maximal at approximately 2.5 days) and growth hormone concentration-dependent (half maximal and maximal at approximately 0.05 and 2.0 nM, respectively). The antimitogenic state was specifically induced by growth hormone and was not mediated by insulin-like growth factor I or prolactin. The growth hormone-induced antimitogenic state was completely reversible. The antimitogenic state was not induced by growth hormone in 3T3-C2 cells, a sister clone of 3T3 cells that exhibits essentially no adipose conversion. The kinetics for growth hormone-dependent commitment to adipose differentiation and induction of the antimitogenic state were similar. We suggest a relationship of growth hormone-induced antimitogenic state and the growth hormone-induced adipose differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells.\r"

  ".W": "Hematopoiesis occurs in close association with a complex network of cells loosely termed the hematopoietic microenvironment. Analysis of the mechanisms of microenvironmental regulation of hematopoiesis has been hindered by the complexity of the microenvironment as well as the heterogeneity of hematopoietic stem cells and early progenitor cells. We have established immortalized primate bone marrow-derived stromal cell lines to facilitate analysis of the interactions of hematopoietic cells with the microenvironment in a large animal species. One such line, PU-34, was found to produce a variety of growth factors, including an activity that stimulates the proliferation of an interleukin 6-dependent murine plasmacytoma cell line. A cDNA encoding the plasmacytoma stimulatory activity was isolated through functional expression cloning in mammalian cells. The nucleotide sequence contained a single long reading frame of 597 nucleotides encoding a predicted 199-amino acid polypeptide. The amino acid sequence of this cytokine, designated interleukin 11 (IL-11), did not display significant similarity with any other sequence in the GenBank data base. Preliminary biological characterization indicates that in addition to stimulating plasmacytoma proliferation, IL-11 stimulates the T-cell-dependent development of immunoglobulin-producing B cells and synergizes with IL-3 in supporting murine megakaryocyte colony formation. These properties implicate IL-11 as an additional multifunctional regulator in the hematopoietic microenvironment.\r"

Rats were treated chronically with various antidepressants, and tyrosine hydroxylase levels were measured in the LC by immunoblot analysis. Representatives of all major classes of antidepressant medication-including imipramine, nortriptyline, tranylcypromine, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, bupropion, iprindole, and electroconvulsive seizures-were found to decrease levels of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity by 40-70% in the LC. Decreased levels of enzyme immunoreactivity were shown to be associated with equivalent decreases in enzyme mRNA levels. Antidepressant regulation of LC tyrosine hydroxylase appeared specific to these compounds, inasmuch as chronic treatment of rats with representatives of other classes of psychotropic drugs, including haloperidol, diazepam, clonidine, cocaine, and morphine, failed to decrease levels of this protein. The results demonstrate that chronic antidepressants dramatically downregulate the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the LC and raise the possibility that such regulation of the enzyme represents an adaptive response of LC neurons to antidepressants that mediates some of their therapeutic actions in depression and/or other psychiatric disturbances.\r"

Attachment of these elements to the rDNA promoter stimulates rRNA synthesis both in vivo and in vitro. The cis-activating effect of the spacer repeats is orientation-independent and increases with increasing numbers of the 140-bp elements. Competition experiments demonstrate that the spacer repeats bind one or more of the transcription factors interaction with the rDNA promoter. Both the 140-bp elements and the core promoter act cooperatively and thus are functionally linked. The 60/81-bp enhancer repeats from Xenopus laevis rDNA compete for a murine transcription factor(s) and stimulate transcription often fused to the mouse rDNA promoter. The results indicate that despite the marked species specificity of rDNA transcription initiation, common factors may interact with both the rDNA promoter and the enhancer.\r"

This region functions as an enhancer when transferred to a heterologous promoter containing a TATA box.

  ".W": "Ras proteins must be isoprenylated at a conserved cysteine residue near the carboxyl terminus (Cys-186 in mammalian Ras p21 proteins) in order to exert their biological activity. Previous studies indicate that an intermediate in the mevalonate pathway, most likely farnesyl pyrophosphate, is the donor of this isoprenyl group. Inhibition of mevalonate synthesis reverts the abnormal phenotypes induced by the mutant RAS2Val-19 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and blocks the maturation of Xenopus oocytes induced by an oncogenic Ras p21 protein of human origin. These results have raised the possibility of using inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway to block the transforming properties of ras oncogenes. Unfortunately, mevalonate is a precursor of various end products essential to mammalian cells, such as dolichols, ubiquinones, heme A, and cholesterol. In this study, we describe an enzymatic activity(ies) capable of catalyzing the farnesylation of unprocessed Ras p21 proteins in vitro at the correct (Cys-186) residue. This farnesylating activity is heat-labile, requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions, is linear with time and with enzyme concentration, and is present in all mammalian cell lines and tissues tested. Gel filtration analysis of a partially purified preparation of protein farnesyltransferase revealed two peaks of activity at 250-350 kDa and 80-130 kDa. Availability of an in vitro protein farnesyltransferase assay should be useful in screening for potential inhibitors of ras oncogene function that will not interfere with other aspects of the mevalonate pathway.\r"

The cholinesterase superfamily includes several esterases with distinct functions and other proteins devoid of the catalytic serine and known esterase activity. To identify the residues involved in catalysis and conferring specificity on the enzyme, we have expressed wild-type Torpedo acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) and several site-directed mutants in a heterologous system. Mutation of serine-200 to cysteine results in diminished activity, while its mutation to valine abolishes detectable activity. Two conserved histidines can be identified at positions 425 and 440 in the cholinesterase family; glutamine replacement at position 440 eliminates activity whereas the mutation at 425 reduces activity only slightly. The assignment of the catalytic histidine to position 440 defines a rank ordering of catalytic residues in cholinesterases distinct from trypsin and subtilisin and suggests a convergence of a catalytic triad to form a third, distinct family of serine hydrolases. Mutation of glutamate-199 to glutamine yields an enzyme with a higher Km and without the substrate-inhibition behavior characteristic of acetylcholinesterase. Hence, modification of the acidic amino acid adjacent to the serine influences substrate association and the capacity of a second substrate molecule to affect catalysis.\r"

Benign adenomas were all negative for p53 overexpression. To determine the molecular basis for this overexpression we examined p53 protein expression in 10 colorectal cancer cell lines. Six of the cell lines expressed high levels of p53 in ELISA, cell-staining, and immunoprecipitation studies. Direct sequencing and chemical-mismatch-cleavage analysis of p53 cDNA by using the polymerase chain reaction in these cell lines showed that all cell lines that expressed high levels of p53 were synthesizing mRNAs that encoded mutant p53 proteins. In two of those four cell lines where p53 expression was lower, point mutations were still detected. Thus, we conclude that overexpression of p53 is synonymous with mutation, but some mutations would not be detected by a simple immunohistochemical analysis. Mutation of the p53 gene is one of the commonest genetic changes in the development of human colorectal cancer.\r"

The reverse Fourier transform of these phase-structure factors is a one-dimensional electrostatic potential map that strongly resembles the electron-density maps calculated from similar x-ray-diffraction data. Determination of the phase values for the electron-diffraction data with structure invariants alone is nearly as successful as the combined use of two separate methods, assigning values to 13 of the 16 reflections--i.e., the electrostatic potential map closely resembles the one calculated with all data.\r"

In contrast to previous fusions obtained using the TnphoA transposon, the entire amino acid sequence of the target protein is present in the fusion product. We have constructed a series of sandwich fusions of alkaline phosphatase to the multispanning cytoplasmic membrane protein MalF. Despite the fact that the alkaline phosphatase was tethered to MalF at both its N and its C terminus, the enzyme exhibited high activity when it was fused to a periplasmic domain of the membrane protein. Cells harboring an alkaline phosphatase sandwich fusion to the end of the first membrane-spanning segment of MalF exhibited both MalF and alkaline phosphatase activity. When alkaline phosphatase was inserted into a cytoplasmic domain of MalF, its specific activity was very low. Our results suggest that the alkaline phosphatase activity of phoA sandwich fusions provides a more sensitive monitor than previous methods of the cellular localization of the domain of the target protein to which the enzyme is fused. Thus, the sandwich fusion approach can give a more accurate picture of membrane protein topology.\r"

We used a heterologous expression system to test whether the leak conductance observed in neurons is mediated by voltage-dependent K+ channels in an altered, debased conformation. Voltage-dependent K+ channels were expressed in an insect cell line infected with a recombinant baculovirus carrying the cDNA for Drosophila Shaker \"A-type\" K+ channels. These expressed channels respond to low Ca2+ identically to voltage-dependent K+ channels in native neuronal membranes; upon removal of external Ca2+, Shaker K+ currents disappear and are replaced by a steady, nonselective leak conductance. However, control cells devoid of Shaker channels were free of any voltage-dependent conductances and did not generate a leak when external Ca2+ was removed. These results show that Ca2+ is essential for proper function of voltage-dependent K+ channels and is required to stabilize the native conformations of these membrane proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that in vivo administration of 1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin, an analog of arginine-8-vasopressin, induces homologous desensitization to vasopressin in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Desensitization has been documented by a decreased physiological response to vasopressin in vivo and by a reduced cAMP accumulation in the cortical thick ascending limb (CTAL). By measuring cAMP content in single isolated medullary thick ascending limbs (MTALs), we now report that desensitization can occur all along the thick ascending limb and, more importantly, that it can also be induced in vitro. In a first series of experiments, we observed that 1 hr after in vivo injection of 1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin, MTALs were desensitized by 80% to vasopressin, whereas the effects of the other hormones acting on the same cyclase pool (glucagon, calcitonin) were fully maintained. In a second set of experiments, desensitization was induced in vitro by vasopressin, the natural hormone. A 60-min preincubation of MTALs with vasopressin caused a marked (up to 86%) and highly reproducible desensitization. The process was dose and time dependent. The apparent Ka for desensitization was 0.2 nM, and the half-maximal effect was obtained within 20 min. The desensitization induced in vitro by vasopressin was again essentially homologous in nature, with 80% of the maximal stimulation of cAMP accumulation being obtained in the presence of glucagon. Desensitization to vasopressin was observed in the presence and absence of indomethacin, indicating that it is independent of prostaglandin synthesis. It is concluded that (i) vasopressin and its analog 1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin cause marked desensitization in the CTAL and MTAL and (ii) the low vasopressin concentrations required to induce desensitization and the rapid onset of the process suggest that it has a physiological significance.\r"

In this study, primary cultures of human placental cells were used to examine the regulation of prorenin release and renin mRNA levels and of the transfected human renin promotor linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter sequences. Treatment of the cultures with a calcium ionophore alone, calcium ionophore plus forskolin (that activates adenylate cyclase), or forskolin plus a phorbol ester increased prorenin release and renin mRNA levels 1.3- to 6-fold, but several classes of steroids did not affect prorenin secretion or renin RNA levels. The transfected renin promoter (584 or 100 base pairs of 5'-flanking DNA) initiated at the correct start site in these cells and forskolin increased its expression 2.5- to 4-fold. Constructs containing renin 5'-flanking DNA linked to a heterologous promoter cotransfected into HeLa cells with either glucocorticoid or estrogen receptor expression vectors were not regulated by dexamethasone or 17 beta-estradiol. These results suggest that (i) the first 584 base pairs of the renin gene 5'-flanking DNA do not contain functional glucocorticoid or estrogen response elements, (ii) placental prorenin release and renin mRNA are regulated by calcium ion and by the combinations of cAMP with either C kinase or calcium ion, and (iii) the first 100 base pairs of the human renin 5'-flanking DNA direct accurate initiation of transcription and can be regulated by cAMP. Thus, some control of renin release in the placenta (and by inference in other tissues) occurs via transcriptional influences on its promoter.\r"

We have carried out hydrodynamic and electron microscopic studies of dinucleosomes--fragments of chromatin containing just two nucleosomes--to test the ability of linker DNA to bend. We find that ionic conditions that stabilize the folding of long chromatin cause linker DNA in dinucleosomes to bend, bringing the two nucleosomes into contact. The results uphold a key prediction of the solenoid model of chromosome folding and suggest a mechanism by which proteins that are separated along the DNA can interact by direct contact.\r"

  ".W": "Dinosaurs figure prominently in discussions of mass extinctions and evolutionary metrics, but their usefulness is hampered by archaic taxonomy, imprecise biostratigraphy, and imperfect preservation that bias our understanding of dinosaur diversity. A critical evaluation shows that of 540 genera and 800 species of dinosaurs proposed since 1824, 285 genera and 336 species are probably valid. Nearly half of all genera are based on a single specimen, and complete skulls and skeletons are known for only 20% of all dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are known from every continent. Countries with the greatest known diversity of dinosaurs are (in descending order) the United States, Mongolia, China, Canada, England, and Argentina; the greatest future increases may be expected from Argentina and China. Nearly half of all dinosaur genera are of latest Cretaceous age (Campanian or Maastrichtian). Estimates of the average duration of a dinosaur genus range from 5 million to 10.5 million years, with the most likely value about 7.7 million years. Dinosaurs evolved as rapidly as Cenozoic mammals. Global dinosaur diversity during the Campanian and Maastrichtian is estimated at 100 genera per stage, using a logistic model to estimate future discoveries. A model of increasing diversity and a bottleneck model compensate for the biasis in the preserved fossil record. The number of dinosaurs that have ever lived is estimated at 900-1200 genera. The fossil record of dinosaurs is presently about 25% complete. Dinosaurs disappeared in the Maastrichtian near the peak of their historic diversity.\r"

We also wanted to establish whether hyperimmune plasma from healthy human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals clears the cell-free virus from circulation. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we were able to provide conclusive evidence that hyperimmune plasma is effective and maintains long-term neutralization of viremia. Using the cell test, we found that in most patients the total antibody level was maintained; in one of the ARC patients, it actually increased 8-fold and has remained at that level for nearly 2 years. The CD4+ cell count decreased in the AIDS patients but was stable in the ARC patient. Clinically, there was an initial improvement in all patients, but five of six of the advanced/terminal AIDS patients had died by month 17. Our studies suggest that passive immunization may be safe in ARC and AIDS patients. It reduces HIV-1 viremia to levels undetectable even by PCR. To advanced/terminal patients, the benefit is of limited duration, while to ARC patients it may be long-term. Therefore, passive immunization should start early in the disease.\r"

Adoptive transfer was facilitated by prior in vivo depletion of RT6.1+ regulatory T cells and in vitro mitogen activation of donor spleen cells. By RT6 depleting diabetes-resistant donors and using nude recipients, transfer of diabetes and thyroiditis was accomplished by using fresh, unstimulated spleen cells. The data suggest that organ-specific autoreactive cells may be present to various degrees but suppressed to a variable extent in many rat strains. The equilibrium between autoreactive and regulatory cells appears to determine the expression of autoimmunity.\r"

We demonstrate that yeast 20S RNA is an independent replicon with no homology to host genomic, mitochondrial, or 2-microns plasmid DNA or to the L-A, L-BC, or M1 double-stranded RNA viruses of yeast. The circularity of the 20S RNA is shown by the apparent absence of 3' and 5' ends, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and by electron microscopy. Replication of yeast 20S RNA proceeds through an RNA-RNA pathway, and a 10,000-fold amplification occurs on shift to acetate medium. The copy number of 20S RNA is also reduced severalfold by the SKI gene products, a host antiviral system that also lowers the copy numbers of yeast double-stranded RNA viruses. Yeast 20S RNA and the hepatitis delta virus show some similarities.\r"

HEV1 is 1018 base pairs long and includes an open reading frame of 204 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative signal sequence of 17 amino acid residues followed by a 187-amino acid polypeptide. This polypeptide has two striking features. The amino-terminal region (43 amino acids) is identical to hevein and shows homology to several chitin-binding proteins and to the amino termini of wound-inducible proteins in potato and poplar. The carboxyl-terminal portion of the polypeptide (144 amino acids) is 74-79% homologous to the carboxyl-terminal region of wound-inducible genes of potato. Wounding, as well as application of the plant hormones abscisic acid and ethylene, resulted in accumulation of hevein transcripts in leaves, stems, and latex but not in roots.\r"

Cholinergically induced nasal submucosal gland secretion has recently been found to contain a low molecular weight nasal antioxidant. In this report, the isolation and identification of this nasal secretory antioxidant are described. Concentrated, cholinergically induced human nasal secretions were fractionated through a 10-kDa sieve and subjected to DEAE anion-exchange chromatography. Fractions containing antioxidant activity were subjected to gel filtration with Bio-Gel P-2 gel (resolution range, 200-2000 Da). The resultant antioxidant fractions were then desalted by gel filtration over the same column equilibrated in HPLC-grade water, yielding only a single peak with antioxidant activity. The absorption spectrum of the purified antioxidant revealed peaks at 238 and 292 nm at pH 7. These peaks shifted to 230 and 280 nm in 0.1 M HCl and 226 and 296 nm in 0.1 M NaOH. Sodium borohydride reduction of the antioxidant had no effect on the UV absorption, whereas platinum-catalyzed hydrogenation ablated all absorption peaks. Uric acid had identical absorption peaks and showed the same chromatographic behavior as the nasal antioxidant activity on both gel filtration and DEAE columns. Uricase (which degrades uric acid) metabolized both uric acid and the purified antioxidant. Uric acid was shown to have antioxidant activity at concentrations greater than 1.5 microM. These data indicate that nasal secretions contain uric acid that serves as an antioxidant.\r"

The highest densities of hybridization were distributed within hippocampal pyramidal and granule cells, medial habenula, Purkinje cells and the molecular layer of cerebellum, and olfactory bulb. Recurrent limbic seizures caused a massive, delayed, and reversible reduction in levels of the kainate receptor mRNA in dentate gyrus; lesser decreases were found in pyramidal cell fields of hippocampus and superficial cortex. These findings provide evidence that unusual patterns of physiological activity can alter genomic expression for a subclass of glutamate receptors in brain.\r"

We examined heteroduplex formation at arg4-nsp, a G.C----C.G transversion that displays a moderately high level of postmeiotic segregation. Of the two possible arg4-nsp/ARG4 mismatches (G.G and C.C), only C.C was detected in spores from mismatch repair-competent (Pms1+) diploids. In contrast, C.C and G.G were present at nearly equal levels in spores from Pms1- diploids. These results confirm previous suggestions that postmeiotic segregation spores contain heteroduplex DNA at the site of the marker in question, that C.C is repaired less frequently than is G.G, and that the PMS1 gene product plays a role in mismatch correction. Combined with the observation that Pms1+ ARG4/arg4-nsp diploids produce 3 times more 3+:5m (wildtype:mutant) tetrads (+, +, +/m, m) than 5+:3m tetrads (+, +/m, m, m), these results indicate that, during meiosis, formation of heteroduplex DNA at ARG4 involves preferential transfer of the sense (nontranscribed) strand of the DNA duplex.\r"

From studies of the patients and their families, haplotypes were defined. It was found that, of the patients who carried HLA-DR4, DQw8, 75% carried one or the other (and in one case, both) of two haplotypes [HLA-B38, SC21, DR4] or HLA-B35, SC31, DR4. The former is a known extended haplotype among normal Jews, with a frequency of 0.102, and the latter may also be an extended haplotype in this ethnic group, with a frequency of 0.017 among normal haplotypes from Jews. Of the remaining DR4-positive patients, all but one had a presumed D-region segment (defined as SC21, DR4, DQw8 or SC31, DR4, DQw8 with variable HLA-B) of these haplotypes. Only one patient had DR4, DQw8 without any other markers of the extended haplotypes. The number of homozygotes and heterozygotes for DR4, DQw8 was consistent with dominant but not recessive (P less than 0.01) inheritance of a class II or a class II-linked susceptibility gene for the disease. Since the disease is entirely attributable to the presence of an antibody to an intraepidermal intercellular cement substance, it is likely that the class II susceptibility gene (on [HLA-B38, SC21, DR4, DQw8], HLA-B35, SC31, DR4, DQw8, or their segments, in Jewish patients) controls the production of the antibody as a dominantly expressed immune response gene.\r"

The labeled oligonucleotide hybridized specifically to the lambda clone 7H9 from the Kohara collection as well as to plasmid pGW511 containing the SOS-regulated dinA gene. Approximately 1400 base pairs of dinA sequence were determined. The predicted amino-terminal sequence of dinA demonstrated that this gene encoded DNA polymerase II. Sequence analysis of the upstream region localized a LexA binding site overlapping the -35 region of the dinA promoter, and this promoter element was found to be only two nucleotides downstream from the 3' end of the araD gene. These results demonstrate that the gene order is thr-dinA (pol II)-ara-leu on the Escherichia coli chromosome and that the DNA polymerase II structural gene is transcribed in the same direction as the araBAD operon. Based on the analysis of the predicted protein, we have identified a sequence motif Asp-Xaa-Xaa-Ser-Leu-Tyr-Pro-Ser in DNA polymerase II that is highly conserved among a diverse group of DNA polymerases, which include those from humans, yeast, Herpes and vaccinia viruses, and phages T4 and PRD1. The demonstration that DNA polymerase II is a component of the SOS response in E. coli suggests that it plays an important role in DNA repair and/or mutagenesis.\r"

The stability of a defined hairpin structure containing a ribosome binding site was varied over 12 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J) by site-directed mutagenesis and the effects on protein yields were analyzed in vivo. The results reveal a strict correlation between translational efficiency and the stability of the helix. An increase in its delta G0 of -1.4 kcal/mol (i.e., less than the difference between an A.U and a G.C pair) corresponds to the reduction by a factor of 10 in initiation rate. Accordingly, a single nucleotide substitution led to the decrease by a factor of 500 in expression because it turned a mismatch in the helix into a match. We find no evidence that exposure of only the Shine-Dalgarno region or the start codon preferentially favors recognition. Translational efficiency is strictly correlated with the fraction of mRNA molecules in which the ribosome binding site is unfolded, indicating that initiation is completely dependent on spontaneous unfolding of the entire initiation region. Ribosomes appear not to recognize nucleotides outside the Shine-Dalgarno region and the initiation codon.\r"

In this article, we show that whole retinal cultures incorporate radioactive mevalonic acid into proteins of 23-26 kDa and one of 8 kDa. The former proteins are probably the \"small\" guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) and the 8-kDa protein is the gamma subunit of the well-studied retinal heterotrimeric G protein (transducin). After deprenylating purified transducin and its subunits with Raney nickel or methyl iodide/base, the adducted prenyl group can be identified as an all-trans-farnesyl moiety covalently linked to a cysteine residue. Thus far, prenylation reactions have been found to occur at cysteine in a carboxyl-terminal consensus CAAX sequence, where C is the cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is undefined. Both the alpha and gamma subunits of transducin have this consensus sequence, but only the gamma subunit is prenylated. Therefore, the CAAX motif is not necessary and sufficient to direct prenylation. Finally, since transducin is the best understood G protein, both structurally and mechanistically, the discovery that it is farnesylated should allow for a quantitative understanding of this post-translational modification.\r"

Lung colonies were measured 2 weeks after inoculation in syngeneic F344 rats, and a bell-shaped dose-response curve with 2- to 3-fold increase in number of surface lung metastases was seen. Maximal enhancement occurred at the 50 pg/ml dose level. The effect was specific because addition of neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibody blocked the stimulatory activity at all levels of TGF-beta 1 pretreatment, but when antibody was given alone, neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibody had no effect on untreated cells. Increased metastatic potential appears to be from an increased propensity of cells to extravasate as tested in the membrane invasion culture system. MTLn3 cells penetrated reconstituted basement-membrane barriers 2- to 3.5-fold more than did untreated control cells, depending upon length of TGF-beta 1 exposure. Increased invasive potential is apparently due, in part, to a 2- to 6-fold increase in type IV collagenolytic (gelatinolytic) and a 2.4-fold increase in heparanase activity. TGF-beta 1 treatment of MTLn3 cells did not alter their growth rate or morphology in the presence of serum; however, growth was inhibited in serum-free medium. Likewise, adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers or to immobilized reconstituted basement membrane or fibronectin matrices was unchanged. These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 may modulate metastatic potential of mammary tumor cells by controlling their ability to break down and penetrate basement-membrane barriers.\r"

Since the human beta-globin LAR is functional in mice, we reasoned that critical LAR sequence elements might be conserved between mice and humans. We therefore cloned murine genomic sequences homologous to one portion of the human LAR (site II, positions -11,054 to -10,322 with respect to the human epsilon gene). We found that this murine DNA fragment (mouse LAR site II) and sequences homologous to human LAR sites I and III are located upstream from the mouse beta-like globin gene cluster and determined that their locations relative to the cluster are similar to that of their human counterparts. The homologous site II sequences are 70% identical between mice and humans over a stretch of approximately 800 base pairs. Multiple core sequences with greater than 80% identity were present within this region. Transient and stable transfection assays of K562 erythroleukemia cells demonstrated that both human and mouse LAR elements contain enhancer activity and confer hemin inducibility on a linked human gamma-globin promoter. These results suggest that primary structural elements--and the spatial organization of these elements--are important for function of the beta-globin LAR.\r"

However research has been limited by difficulties in isolation, since dendritic cells make up only 0.1-1% of blood mononuclear cells. We present a protocol that reliably yields preparations that are greater than 80-90% pure. The method relies on the sequential depletion of the major cell types in blood and simultaneously provides T cells, monocytes, and B plus natural killer cells for comparison with dendritic cells. The last step in the procedure is the removal of residual contaminants on the basis of expression of a CD45R epitope. The enrichment of dendritic cells is evident by three criteria, each of which is related to the surface of these antigen-presenting cells. (i) All dendritic cells are motile, constantly forming large lamellipodia or veils. (ii) When analyzed with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies and the FACS, the cells express high levels of all known polymorphic major histocompatibility complex gene products, as well as a distinct combination of receptors and adhesion molecules. Unlike monocytes, for example, dendritic cells lack Fc receptors and the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (c-fms) but express much higher levels of ICAM-1 and LFA-3 adhesins. (iii) In functional assays, dendritic cells are at least 100 times more potent than monocytes or lymphocytes in stimulating the primary mixed leukocyte reaction. These properties help make the trace subset of dendritic cells more amenable to further functional and clinical studies.\r"

This 110-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 is distinct from the relatively small (14-kDa) dithiothreitol-sensitive phospholipases A2 that are secreted from many cell types. This additional phospholipase A2 selectively hydrolyzes fatty acid at the sn-2 position of the glycerol and favors phospholipids containing arachidonic acid, which is the rate-limiting precursor for prostaglandin and leukotriene production. Interestingly, a greater than 5-fold increase in phospholipase A2 activity is noted as the calcium concentration increases from the levels found in resting cells to those observed in activated macrophages. We suggest that this enzyme and not the previously described secretory phospholipase A2 is activated by cytosolic effectors such as GTP-binding regulatory proteins and protein kinases to initiate the production of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor. To distinguish this cytosolic enzyme from the previously described secretory ones, we suggest referring to it as cPLA2 for cytosolic phospholipase A2 and collectively referring to the secretory phospholipases A2 as sPLA2s.\r"

Exocytic transport vesicles immunoisolated from the total budded population were enriched in the mature forms of secretory and membrane proteins destined to the basolateral plasma membrane and were depleted in lysosomal enzymes and galactosyl-transferase activity. The finding that a major proportion (greater than 70%) of newly synthesized, siaylated secretory and transmembrane proteins is contained in a single population of post-Golgi transport vesicles implies that, in a constitutively secreting cell, basolaterally destined proteins are sorted and packaged together into the same exocytic transport vesicles.\r"

  ".U": "91017576\r", 
  ".W": "The binding of antigen to the multicomponent T-cell receptor (TCR) activates several signal transduction pathways via coupling mechanisms that are poorly understood. One event that follows antigen receptor engagement is the activation of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC). TCR activation by antigen, lectins, or anti-TCR monoclonal antibody has also been shown to cause increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR-zeta and other substrates, suggesting stimulation of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. A critical question is whether these two pathways, PLC and PTK, are independently activated or whether one initiates and/or regulates the other. In the former case, PLC activation could be coupled to the TCR via a GTP-binding protein (G protein). We have reported, however, that tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates precedes detection of PLC activation and intracellular calcium elevation, suggesting that inositol phospholipid turnover in T cells is initiated by a PTK pathway. In this study, we test this hypothesis by treating T cells with the drug herbimycin A. We demonstrate that this agent inhibits substrate tyrosine phosphorylation, TCR-mediated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, and calcium elevation. In contrast, under these conditions G-protein-mediated PLC activity, as tested by addition of aluminum fluoride, remains intact. Furthermore, whereas herbimycin treatment prevents TCR-mediated interleukin 2 production and interleukin 2 receptor expression, phorbol ester-induced effects are substantially resistant to herbimycin. The drug thus appears to abrogate TCR-mediated signaling without affecting distal signaling mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "91017577\r", 
  ".W": "Individuals infected by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) demonstrate progressive depletion and qualitative dysfunction of the helper T4 (CD4+) cell population. Mechanisms proposed for attrition of CD4+ T cells include direct cytopathicity of these mature cells following infection as well as infection of early T-lymphocyte progenitors. The latter mechanism could lead to failure to regenerate mature functioning CD4+ T cells. The present study determines the susceptibility of thymocytes at various stages of maturity to infection with HIV-1. Various normal thymocyte populations were inoculated with HIV-1, including unfractionated (UF), CD3- CD4- CD8- [\"triple negative\" (TN)], CD4+ CD8+ [\"double positive\" (DP)] thymocytes, and thymocyte populations obtained by limited dilution cloning. Cultures were studied for the presence of HIV-1 DNA by polymerase chain reaction in addition to examination for reverse transcriptase activity. We determined that transformed T-cell and thymocyte cell lines completely lacking CD4 were not susceptible to infection by HIV-1, whereas all of the following lines were: UF thymocytes (70-90% CD4hi+); DP thymocytes (99% CD4hi+); TN thymocytes (0% CD4hi+); and TCR alpha beta +, TCR gamma delta +, or CD16+ CD3- (natural killer) thymocyte clones expressing variable levels of CD4 and representing the progeny of TN thymocytes. [TCR alpha beta + and TCR gamma delta + refer to the chains of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), and CD4hi refers to a strong rightward shift (greater than 30 linear channels) of the CD4 curve on flow cytometric analysis compared with control.] Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to CD4 (T4a epitope) but not to CD3 (T3) were capable of blocking infection of mature and immature CD4hi+ thymocytes. Moreover, anti-CD4(T4a) mAbs also inhibited infection of CD4hi- TN thymocytes, indicating that these T-cell precursors--despite their apparent \"triple negativity\" (CD3- CD4hi- CD8-)--expressed sufficient CD4 molecules to become infected. Cell sorter analysis with a panel of CD4 mAbs demonstrated a mean shift of the mean fluorescence channel (MFC) with CD4 mAbs on TN thymocytes of 6 +/- 4 MFC units. Thus, intrathymic T-cell precursors and their progeny representing many stages of T-cell ontogeny are susceptible to infection by HIV-1, including early TN thymocytes, which express very low levels of CD4. Infection of multiple stages and multiple subsets of the T-cell lineage in man, mediated via the CD4 molecule, may explain the inability of the T-cell pool to regenerate in the setting of progressive HIV infection.\r"

We have identified two additional genes, GRO beta and GRO gamma, that share 90% and 86% identity at the deduced amino acid level with the original GRO alpha isolate. One amino acid substitution of proline in GRO alpha by leucine in GRO beta and GRO gamma leads to a large predicted change in protein conformation. Significant differences also exist in the 3' untranslated region, including different numbers of ATTTA repeats associated with mRNA instability. A 122-base-pair region in the 3' region is conserved among the three GRO genes, and a part of it is also conserved in the Chinese hamster genome, suggesting a role in regulation. DNA hybridization with oligonucleotide probes and partial sequence analysis of the genomic clones confirm that the three forms are derived from related but different genes. Only one chromosomal locus has been identified, at 4q21, by using a GRO alpha cDNA clone that hybridized to all three genes. Expression studies reveal tissue-specific regulation as well as regulation by specific inducing agents, including interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and lipopolysaccharide.\r"

Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a panel of primary human breast tumor DNAs has led to the identification of two additional regions on chromosomes 17q and 18q that frequently are affected by LOH. Deletions of each of these regions have a significant correlation with clinical parameters that are associated with aggressive breast carcinomas. Previous restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of this panel of tumors has uncovered several other frequently occurring mutations. LOH on chromosome 18q frequently occurs in tumors with concomitant LOH of loci on chromosomes 17p and 11p. Similarly, tumors having LOH on 17q also have LOH on chromosomes 1p and 3p. This suggests that certain combinations of mutations may collaborate in the development and malignant progression of breast carcinomas.\r"

In addition, in decorticated rats, but not in controls, galanin mRNA could be seen in dorsal and ventral nuclei of the thalamus and in the remaining parts of the cortex. Increases in galanin mRNA and galanin-like immunoreactivity were also observed in the septum-vertical diagonal band after electrocoagulation lesions of the ventral hippocampus. In contrast, no changes were found after ibotenic acid lesions of the same hippocampal area.

Both these analogues were found to be completely resistant to degradation by either DNA- or RNA-specific nucleases. Use of biotinylated derivatives of the probes to affinity-select ribonucleoprotein particles from crude HeLa cell nuclear extracts showed that the presence of the bulky 3,3-dimethylallyl group significantly reduces affinity selection, whereas the allyl derivative binds rapidly and stably to targeted sequences and affinity-selects efficiently. The allyl derivatives also showed an increase in the level of specific binding to targeted sequences compared with 2'-O-methyl probes of identical sequence. These properties indicate that the 2'-O-allyl oligoribonucleotides are particularly well suited for use as antisense probes.\r"

The families of short interspersed elements, B1 and B2, preferentially cluster in the R, or reverse, bands. There is no evidence of any interspersed repeat present in the centromeric heterochromatic regions. Both the long interspersed element and B2 probes give banding patterns suitable for karyotype analysis. Simultaneous hybridization of the biotinylated long interspersed element probe and a digoxigenin-labeled cosmid to metaphase spreads allows rapid localization of a probe of interest to a particular cytogenetic band on a chromosome.\r"

Exogenous copies of wild-type RB have been shown to suppress the tumorigenicity of several types of tumor cells with endogenous RB mutations, including a previously described human prostatic carcinoma cell line. To further support a role for RB inactivation in the genesis of prostate cancer, seven primary or metastatic prostate carcinoma specimens were examined for evidence of RB mutation. By the use of immunoblot analysis and immunostaining of histologic sections, RB-encoded protein was readily detected in tumor cells of five specimens, was equivocally detected in one specimen, and was apparently absent from tumor cells of one specimen. RB mutations in the latter case were precisely characterized as (i) a deletion of 103 nucleotides containing transcriptional start sites and (ii) loss of the second RB allele. The 103-base-pair deletion was sufficient to abolish the promoter activity of upstream DNA sequences in a heterologous expression system. These results (i) demonstrate that RB can be inactivated in vivo by mutation of its promoter, (ii) confirm the existence of RB mutations in some human prostate carcinomas, and (iii) suggest the use of immunohistochemical methods to screen for RB mutations in clinical samples of common adult neoplasms.\r"

It is argued that animals have a broad array of inducible general defenses to combat the changing array of toxic chemicals in plant food (nature's pesticides) and that these defenses are effective against both natural and synthetic toxins. Synthetic toxins such as dioxin are compared to natural chemicals, such as indole carbinol (in broccoli) and ethanol. Trade-offs between synthetic and natural pesticides are discussed. The finding that in high-dose tests, a high proportion of both natural and synthetic chemicals are carcinogens, mutagens, teratogens, and clastogens (30-50% for each group) undermines current regulatory efforts to protect public health from synthetic chemicals based on these tests.\r"

  ".W": "The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transactivator Rev is a nuclear protein that regulates expression of certain HIV-1 transcripts by binding to an RNA target element (the RRE) present in these transcripts. A short arginine-rich sequence in Rev contains the signals required to direct this protein into nuclei, where it associates preferentially with nucleoli. We created a steroid-inducible transactivator by fusing Rev with the steroid-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This Rev/GR protein remains inactive in the cytoplasm when steroids are absent, but it enters the nucleus and initiates transactivation within minutes after exposure to dexamethasone. Although the GR moiety is sufficient to transport Rev/GR into nuclei, mutation of certain residues in the arginine-rich region blocks nucleolar localization and also inhibits transactivation. We find that other mutations in this region, however, can abolish the function of Rev/GR without affecting its localization; the latter phenotype may reflect a specific defect in binding of the RRE.\r"

In this study, overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to the complete AChR alpha-subunit sequence were used to propagate polyclonal AChR-specific T helper cell lines from four myasthenic patients of different HLA types. Response of the T helper lines to the individual peptides was studied. Four immunodominant sequence segments were identified--i.e., residues 48-67, 101-120, 304-322, and 419-437. These regions did not include residues known to form the main immunogenic region or the cholinergic binding site, and they frequently contained sequence motifs that have been proposed to be related to T-epitope formation.\r"

The PEDI is a new functional assessment instrument for the evaluation of disabled children aged 6 months to 7 years. The PEDI has been developed to identify functional status and change along three dimensions: 1) functional skill level, 2) caregiver assistance, and 3) modifications or adaptive equipment used. The PEDIs were administered as a parental-report questionnaire, and the results were compared with data obtained by the Battelle Developmental Inventory Screening Test (BDIST). The BDIST is a standardized assessment with developmental and adaptive content. Subjects were 20 children between the ages of 2 and 8 years with arthritic conditions and spina bifida and 20 nondisabled children matched for age and sex. All subjects' scores on the BDIST cognitive domain were no greater than 1.50 standard deviations below the mean for their age group. Concurrent validity was supported by moderately high Pearson product-moment correlations between BDIST and PEDI summary scores (r = .70-.80). Construct validity was supported by significant differences between the disabled and nondisabled groups' PEDI scores and by discriminant analysis identifying the PEDI scores as better group discriminators than the BDIST scores. Results validate the Developmental Edition of the PEDI and support the further development and standardization of the final version. Use of the PEDI in clinical pediatric physical therapy practice is discussed.\r"

Sixty-one men between 20 and 30 years of age served as subjects. Lumbar curve measurements were taken with a flexible ruler with the subjects first standing and then sitting in the two chairs. Hamstring and hip flexor muscle lengths were indicated by range-of-motion measurements taken with a gravity goniometer. Age, number of hours spent sitting per day, upper body length, and right leg length also were recorded. Subjects had significantly more lumbar extension when they sat in the BMC than when they sat in the SCC. Hip flexor length was the only factor that appeared to relate significantly to the difference between the standing lumbar curve and the lumbar curves in the BMC and the SCC.\r"

Twelve healthy subjects each participated in two experimental sessions. Thirty cycles (cycle time: 8 seconds \"on\"/12 seconds \"off\") were applied during each session. During one session, a frequency of 60 pulses per second (pps) was used for all trains. During the other session, the subjects were stimulated with 60 pps for the first train. The stimulating frequency of each train was then progressively reduced, in 5-pps steps, for contractions 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 20. By the fifth contraction, the differences in average force produced by the 60-pps trains and the reduced-frequency trains were significant. The difference between the two conditions increased, with the variable-frequency protocol producing 46% more force than the constant-frequency protocol during the last contraction. These results showed that, compared with a constant pulse frequency, reducing the pulse frequency during a fatiguing contraction can markedly decrease the rate of force fatigue of skeletal muscle. This finding suggests that a variable-frequency protocol, similar to the one used in this may prove to be a more effective pattern of stimulation for activation of skeletal muscle than the traditionally used constant-frequency protocol.\r"

During the treatment and treatment/orthoses phases, a decrease in excessive knee flexion was noted. Changes in trend over time were greater in the 3-week treatment phase than in the 3-week treatment/orthoses phase. Changes in level at the initiation of the treatment/orthoses phase were greater than in the treatment phase. The described neuro-developmental treatment activities were conducted correctly 92% of the time according to an independent observer. The interrater reliability of goniometric data measured by videography was .93 using intraclass correlation coefficients. The results of this study suggest that both methods of treatment can be used to decrease excessive knee flexion during gait in a child with diplegia.\r"

Phase I is a flexion-momentum phase used to generate the initial momentum for rising. Phase II begins as the individual leaves the chair seat and ends at maximal ankle dorsiflexion. Forward momentum of the upper body is transferred to forward and upward momentum of the total body. Phase III is an extension phase during which the body rises to its full upright position. Phase IV is a stabilization phase. Kinetics and kinematics of the phases are analyzed. The phases are differentiated in terms of momentum and stability characteristics. Clinical implications of the mechanics of rising are discussed.\r"

The average follow-up was 5.0 years and included clinical, dental, and cephalometric examinations according to a prescribed protocol. The study demonstrated that the procedure could be safely performed in the younger child with an acceptable level of morbidity. There was a remarkable degree of postoperative stability of the maxillary segment. However, although vertical (inferior) growth or movement of the midfacial segment was demonstrated, there was minimal, if any, anterior or horizontal growth. Any occlusal disharmony developing during the period of follow-up could be attributed to anticipated mandibular development and could be corrected by orthognathic surgery. The roles of surgical overcorrection and anterior-pull headgear therapy after release of intermaxillary fixation are also discussed. The Le Fort III osteotomy is justifiably indicated during early childhood for psychological and physiologic reasons.\r"

Late repair of this defect is complicated by high fistula formation and subjects the patient to the problems of palate fistula for extended periods of time. We have utilized a single procedure performed when the child is 3 months of age that completely closes the anterior hard palate and alveolus along with the cleft lip. Our series consisted of 61 consecutive patients with unilateral clefts of the primary and secondary palate. Mucosal turnover flaps from the vomer along with lateral nasal mucosal flaps provide the nasal lining. A buccal sulcus flap with a Veau flap completes the oral repair. Ninety-five percent (58 of 61) of the patients had complete and stable closure of their anterior palate and alveolus after 1 year. The incidence of fistula formation in our series (3 of 61) is much lower than that reported with the utilization of other protocols. Excellent exposure of the anterior palate and alveolar defect during lip repair, early restoration of anatomic relationships, establishment of a good nostril floor and sill, and very low fistula formation are among the benefits of this procedure. The increase in operative time is considered minimal in light of aforementioned advantages.\r"

Through the operating microscope we were able to identify the SMAS and its relationship to other anatomic structures. Full-thickness longitudinal sections were obtained for routine histologic studies along various surgically relevant regions of the SMAS. In addition, dissections were accomplished with the operating microscope on 12 rhesus monkey fetuses ranging in age from a few weeks to 8 months. Data obtained from the fresh cadaver microdissections, topographic histology, and comparative anatomy revealed the presence of the SMAS as a distinct fibromuscular layer composed of the platysma muscle, parotid fascia, and fibromuscular layer covering the cheek.\r"

To determine the long-term outcome from this surgery, the records of 96 patients who had undergone chest-wall resection with musculocutaneous flap reconstruction were reviewed. Median survival for the entire group was 20.5 months, but a more accurate prediction of outcome could be obtained by dividing the patients into three groups. In group I, patients free of known malignancy and undergoing resection of radionecrotic tissues, median survival was 60.0 months. In group II, patients with resectable disease and free of tumor following surgery, median survival was 31.1 months. In group III, patients incompletely resected or known to have metastatic disease following surgery, median survival was only 12.5 months. Even in group III, however, some individuals achieved prolonged survival and lasting benefits from the surgery, so these data should not be used to exclude patients from undergoing necessary palliative procedures.\r"

  ".U": "91018059\r", 
  ".W": "The efficacy of intraoperative expansion in reducing the tension of wound closure was tested in young pigs. The young piglet as a model for studying human skin was characterized by finding a close similarity between the modulus of elasticity of young piglet skin and human abdominoplasty and mammaplasty skin (range 12.8 to 23.7 N/mm2 for piglet skin, 14.3 to 19 N/mm2 for human skin). The tension required to close a standardized wound was determined before undermining, after undermining, and finally after intraoperative expansion. These measurements were performed in 10 young pigs with an average weight of 11.5 kg. Undermining the wound edges resulted in a significant decrease in the force required to close the wounds (p less than 0.0001). Intraoperative expansion did not significantly decrease the tension. Previous work showing the importance of site and direction of pull on the tension for wound closure was confirmed in this study. Analysis of variance demonstrated that the tension required to close a standard wound is greater high on the pig's back than near the belly and near the shoulder as opposed to the hip for midflank wounds (p less than 0.0001). Increasing the extent of undermining from 62 to 136 cm2 significantly decreased the tension for wound closure (p less than 0.05). Further undermining did not result in a significant decrease in wound closure tension. In this model, intraoperative expansion offers no advantage over simple undermining. We suggest that the benefit reported by clinicians using intraoperative expansion may derive from an increase in the extent of undermining required to place expanders under the wound margins.\r"

  ".U": "91018060\r", 
  ".W": "A porcine rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap model was designed and validated in nine pigs. This TRAM flap was based on the deep inferior epigastric (DIE) vessels with an 8 x 18 cm transverse skin paddle at the superior end of the rectus abdominis muscle. The model was subsequently used to test our hypothesis of surgical augmentation of flap viability by vascular territory expansion. Specifically, we observed that ligation of the superior epigastric (SE) vessels at 4, 7, 14, and 28 days (N = 6 to 8) prior to raising the TRAM flaps significantly increased (p less than 0.05) the length and area of the viable skin in the transverse skin paddles of the treatment flaps compared with the contralateral shammanipulated control flaps. This significant increase in skin viability was seen to be accompanied by a significant increase (p less than 0.05) in skin and muscle capillary blood flow in the treatment TRAM flaps compared with the controls (N = 9). The mechanism of vascular territory expansion is unclear. We postulate that hypoxia resulting from the ligation of the superior epigastric vessels prior to the flap surgery may play a role in the triggering of the deep inferior epigastric artery to take over some of the territory previously perfused by the superior epigastric artery. This would then increase the skin and muscle capillary blood flow in the transverse paddle when the TRAM flap was raised on the deep inferior epigastric vascular pedicle.\r"

Using a pig model, 55 animals were operated on and the critical ischemia times and survival patterns of the buttock skin (n = 85) and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous (n = 88) island flaps were determined after being submitted to 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 hours of normothermic ischemia. The average critical ischemia times (CIT50) were determined to be 9 and 10 hours for the buttock skin and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps, respectively. Percentage of total area surviving (%TAS) in those flaps which did survive was adversely affected by increases in the ischemic interval in both flap models. A statistically significant decrease in percentage of total area surviving was found after 6 and 8 hours of ischemia for the buttock skin and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps, respectively.\r"

In three patients, the interval between the first and second procedures was less than 2 weeks. The remaining four patients had their second free-tissue transfer performed 5 weeks to 21 months after the first. Six of the seven free flaps were successful. Two patients with venous obstruction occurring after the second free-tissue transfer were salvaged by reexploration. Partial loss of the flap was noted in one of these patients. It is concluded from this select group of patients that failure of a free-tissue transfer does not contraindicate a second microtissue transfer does not contraindicate a second microvascular free-tissue transfer.\r"

In another group, 20 venous autografts were interpositioned after irrigation with heparinized saline and another 10 autografts were interpositioned without irrigation. After 1 week, four irrigated grafts were partially occluded with a red thrombus; after 6 months, all grafts were totally occluded. In a third group, 15 lymphaticolymphatic anastomoses were enveloped by a silicone sheet to provoke prolonged devascularization. None of the vessels was patent. Anastomotic patency was inspected in vivo postoperatively. The specimens were studied with light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Prolonged devascularization damaged the endothelial cells. The results show that the lymphatic vessel autograft is the best choice for an interpositional autografting to bridge a defect in lymphatic vessels.\r"

From the same harvest site, one level deeper, a second layer consisting of split-thickness dermis (0.14 inch) is taken. Both the first and second layers are meshed and expanded. The remaining degloved flap is excised and, on a sterile bench, defatted to produce a third layer of deep dermis. In our case, this third layer was ultimately lost, but it functioned well as a temporary biologic dressing. Depending on donor-site morbidity, other potential applications of this method (i.e., major burn injuries) may be feasible.\r"
