When the cells were pretreated for 8 to 9 hr with either E. coli lipopolysaccharide or recombinant interleukin 1 (beta), prostaglandin release increased. Inclusion of recombinant IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma during the pretreatment phase blocked subsequent prostaglandin release. Interferons were effective at concentrations in the range of 1 to 10 antiviral units/ml, and the inhibition was manifested within several hours after exposure to the lymphokine. Similar trends were observed by measuring thromboxane release. These data suggest antagonistic roles for interleukin 1 and interferon in the regulation of eicosanoid release from monocytes.\r"

The CD1c antigen recognized by the M241 monoclonal antibody was detected on the circulating mononuclear cells of three children with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). Two-color immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that M241 expression (43 to 95%) was limited to cells expressing the B cell-restricted antigens B4 (CD19), B1 (CD20), and surface immunoglobulin. To confirm M241 expression on normal cells of the B lineage rather than aberrant expression limited to SCID B cells, its expression was demonstrated serologically and biochemically on purified B cells from spleen, tonsil, and peripheral blood. Parallel analyses with monoclonal antibodies NA1/34 and 4A76 demonstrated that the CD1a and CD1b molecules were negative on all B cells that were studied. It has been hypothesized that the CD1 molecules represent the human counterpart of the murine thymus leukemia antigens due to their similar size, limited tissue distribution, and association with beta 2-microglobulin. This study suggests that a subset of CD1 antigens detected by M241 (CD1c) may represent a human analog of a murine Qa antigen due to its extended distribution on normal peripheral B cells.\r"

It was revealed that each IgG and IgM anti-DNA antibody synthesis was under the regulation of separate L3T4+ helper and Ly-2+ suppressor T cells. The function of these class-specific regulatory T cells was age-dependent. Although the helper effect of L3T4+ T cells on IgG antibody synthesis increased, the effect of L3T4+ T cells on IgM antibody production decreased in B/W F1 mice with aging. The IgG anti-DNA antibody production in the cocultures of L3T4+ T cells and B cells was suppressed by addition of Ly-2+ T cells from young but not aged B/W F1 mice, whereas the production of IgM anti-DNA antibodies was suppressed by Ly-2+ T cells from aged but not young B/W F1 mice. We also found that although IgM anti-DNA antibody-producing B cells were already present in 2-mo-old mice, B cells producing IgG antibodies under the influence of L3T4+ T cells appeared in mice at 7 mo of age. These data clearly indicate that separate class-specific regulatory T cells are involved in the production of IgM and IgG anti-DNA antibodies and that the total serum level of the antibodies is reflected by both their age-associated changes and the generation of antibody-forming B cells in B/W F1 mice.\r"

Stimulated but not resting monocytes displayed the Tac peptide of the interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptor within 24 hr as measured by immunofluorescence staining and [3H] Tac binding. The total number of anti-Tac binding sites on co-stimulated monocytes was 13,700. By using scatchard analysis with radiolabeled IL 2, the activated cells were shown to express low numbers (below 100 sites/cell) of high affinity binding sites with a KD of approximately 15 pM. LPS and IFN-gamma were additive in augmenting the number of IL 2 and anti-Tac binding sites. By using an ELISA assay specific for the soluble released form of the Tac peptide we identified 112 U/ml of IL 2 receptors in the supernatant of monocytes stimulated for 24 hr with IFN-gamma, 233 U/ml after stimulation with LPS, and 519 U/ml after the addition of both stimulating agents. Both the membrane form (55,000 daltons), as well as the soluble form (45,000 to 50,000 daltons) of the Tac, IL 2 receptor, peptide from monocytes were shown by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis to be similar size to the comparable forms of these receptors derived from activated T cells. In addition, monocytes stimulated for 8 hr contained mRNA specifically hybridizing to a cDNA probe coding for the Tac peptide. Finally, activated monocytes responded to the addition of recombinant IL 2 by an increase in H2O2 production that was measured by using fluorescent indicator 2,7-dichlorofluorescein. This response as well as the observed induction of monocytic IL 2 receptors by LPS may point to a functional role for this receptor during monocyte/macrophage responses to microbial infections.\r"

However, relatively high amounts of lipid X were necessary for induction, and the levels of TNF were much less than those induced by small amounts of lipid A itself or LPS. Lipid X prepared by extraction of Escherichia coli mutants induced higher levels of TNF than the chemically synthesized material, but this is probably partially due to amounts of impurities in the extracted material. Pretreatment of macrophages with IFN-gamma resulted in the release of higher amounts of TNF on subsequent induction with either LPS or lipid X. In contrast, pretreatment of macrophages with LPS induced hyporesponsiveness for TNF production on subsequent rechallenge with LPS. Lipid X, on the other hand, was incapable of making macrophages hyporesponsive for TNF production.\r"

  ".U": "87196418\r", 
  ".W": "The mitogens phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A inhibited the appearance of the very late activation antigen (VLA)-1, but did not inhibit VLA-2 expression on cultured activated T cells. In contrast to diminished VLA-1 expression, mitogen treatment caused increased cell surface expression of other activation antigens such as T10, HLA-DR, interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptor, and 4F2, and greater cell proliferation. Conversely, when T cells were not repetitively restimulated with mitogen, these less proliferative \"postactivated\" T cells had elevated VLA-1 expression. The diminished expression of VLA-1 caused by PHA was reversible since subsequent removal of mitogen was associated with increased VLA-1, paralleled by a decrease in interleukin 2 receptor levels. In addition to preventing or delaying the initial appearance of VLA-1, PHA stimulation also was somewhat effective in causing the disappearance of VLA-1 already present, especially on recently established cultures. However, cultures that had either never seen PHA, not seen PHA for several weeks, or been stimulated regularly with PHA, but were several months old, did not lose VLA-1 in response to PHA stimulation, suggesting that a state of insensitivity to PHA effects could be attained. Unlike PHA-stimulated T cells, T cells repetitively restimulated with alloantigen or the monoclonal antibody T3 did not show a marked absence of VLA-1 but rather showed an increased level of VLA-2 relative to VLA-1. Taken together, results of stimulation by either mitogen, alloantigen, or anti-T3 monoclonal antibody support the conclusion that T cell stimulation in general can cause a decreased VLA-1:VLA-2 ratio, whether by decreased VLA-1 or increased VLA-2. These shifts in VLA-1:VLA-2 ratios are probably not simply the result of shifts in the relative proportions of different subpopulations, because similar growth-related changes in this ratio were observed on the T cell line ANITA, which is a homogeneous population of cells. Because both VLA-1 and VLA-2 are differentially regulated on cultured, long term activated T cells depending on stage of activation and growth conditions, and are members of a family of at least five heterodimers that includes cell matrix adhesion molecules, we suggest that these studies will provide clues to novel aspects of T cell growth regulation, perhaps relating to T cell-matrix adhesion.\r"

  ".W": "We demonstrated previously that injection of adult rabbits with homologous anti-VHa1 allotype antibody induces the appearance in serum of genetically unexpected (latent) a1 immunoglobulin (Ig) and a1-like internal images. We have now investigated the mechanism for this induction effect and have found that treatment of animals with polyclonal goat or monoclonal mouse anti-a1 antibody similarly results in production of unexpected a1 determinants. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of deblocked heavy chains showed that latent a1 Ig induced by monoclonal antibody treatment was identical to nominal a1 Ig at 18 of 19 residues, with the one amino acid difference at position 13 probably due to a single nucleotide change. Like nominal a1, these molecules expressed multiple VHa1 framework epitopes, as demonstrated by direct immunoelectron microscopic visualization of immune complexes. Whereas F(ab)'2 fragments of rabbit anti-a1 antibody retained inducing activity, F(ab) fragments were effective only when administered in an aggregated form; this result suggests that cross-linking of surface Ig receptors plays a critical role in the induction process. We conclude that all rabbits contain dormant B cells expressing germ-line-encoded latent allotypes, and that in vivo administration of anti-Ig antibody causes activation of these cells directly rather than through perturbation of an allotype regulatory network.\r"

M. leprae antigens suppressed T cell proliferation in response to mitogens and antigens in both lepromatous and tuberculoid patients, as well as controls never exposed to M. leprae or M. leprae endemic areas. Both soluble and particulate fractions of M. leprae were found to suppress proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The extent of suppression was inversely related to the proliferative response of the donors mononuclear cells to M. leprae. Evidence indicates that M. leprae contains both stimulatory and suppressive molecules for T cells. One such suppressive antigen, Lipoarabinomannan (LAM)-B of M. leprae, also suppressed the proliferative response of tuberculoid patients. Suppression was also observed with the LAM-B of M. tuberculosis. The suppressive effects observed were not due to the toxicity of the antigen. Some of the suppressive activity was mediated by T8+ suppressor cells and was expressed in both lepromatous and tuberculoid patients. We suggest that previous sensitization to M. leprae and other cross-reactive mycobacterial antigens determines the sensitivity of T cells to the suppressive effects of M. leprae antigens.\r"

  ".U": "87196438\r", 
  ".W": "We have found a novel immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in a murine hybridoma in which a heavy chain variable region (VH) heptamer-nonamer recognition sequence is joined to the diversity segment (D) through head-to-head fusion. The heptamer-nonamer recognition sequence and its adjacent 5' DNA are derived from the downstream flanking region of a germline VH gene. Sequence analysis indicates that this adjacent DNA is homologous to the downstream flank of VH108B, and it has characteristics of RNA processing that may suggest it was derived from an mRNA intermediate; these unusual features indicate that the segment is a processed gene. Because of head-to-head fusion, the recognition sequence and the flanking sequence are in opposite transcriptional polarity to D. The latter is joined correctly at its 3' border to a joining (J) gene segment. A gamma 1 constant region (but not mu) is located further downstream. Thus this fragment has several features common to normal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement despite the unusual joining event involving V-D. Linkage of the VH heptamer-nonamer recognition sequence to D has not been observed previously. Although the recognition sequence described is inverted with respect to D and J, the endonucleolytic process that cleaved the recognition sequence at the 5' border of the heptamer before rearranging it to D was accurate. We suggest that of the three functions associated with the recombinase reaction; recognition, cutting, and ligation, only recognition and cutting may be limited to specific structures, and the ligation step may be less restricted because it is not confined to forming coding-to-coding or flank-to-flank joints. This aberrant ligation product suggests that the information leading to normal rearrangements may be found in structures that include more than the recognition sequences or coding regions alone, because the joining described here has spliced the incorrect end of a recognition sequence to a coding region to yield a nonproductive recombination.\r"

  ".W": "The variable region sequences of light and heavy chains (VL and VH) were determined for 11 hybridoma antibodies produced in response to the PC moiety on Proteus morganii. These hybridomas were derived from two separate fusions, one obtained from mice early in a secondary response and the other from late in a secondary response. All of these antibodies possessed a cross-reactive idiotype found on anti-PC antibodies in the M603 family, and exhibited preferential specificity for PC in the context of P. morganii. We found that all of the antibodies were derived from a single VH/VL pair. VH was encoded by V1, DFL16.1 and JH1, and VL was encoded by a consensus VK8 gene and JK5. Antibodies differed from each other by somatic point mutations that occurred at a high rate. The mutations in VL were approximately one-third as abundant as those in VH and were randomly distributed throughout the molecule. Mutations in VH were concentrated in CDR 2 and 3 and had a replacement to silent ratio that was three to six times greater than predicted from random accumulation. Based on the sequence data, a single genealogic tree with multiple branches could accommodate all the hybrids from a fusion. We concluded that in both examples the anti-PC response arose by somatic mutation and stepwise selection from a single precursor. Antigen binding studies with these 11 hybridomas and a 12th that had no mutations revealed that the acquisition of preferential specificity for antigen was dependent on somatic mutation of germline genes. Additional binding studies demonstrated that continued selection during clonal expansion was probably antigen driven. An unexpected finding was five independently selected antibodies from one fusion that had identically mutated VH and VL sequences. We suggest that the hypermutation mechanism is not a continuously active process during clonal expansion and that it is regulated, probably during the mid to late phase of the primary response.\r"

Among [35S]methionine-labeled proteins, which are induced in an actinomycin- or alpha-amanitin-sensitive manner, is a prominent group with an apparent relative molecular mass of 53,000 and pI of 5.3-5.8. The synthesis of these proteins continues for at least 4 days in the presence of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). Over the concentration range tested, up to 670 pM, there is no inhibition of protein synthesis, so the appearance of these proteins cannot be explained by overall inhibition of protein synthesis. Furthermore, at 4 pM we found only minor inhibition of DNA (21%) and RNA (29%) synthesis. Half-maximal induction of the prominent 53 kD proteins occurs at an interferon concentration of 0.8-3.5 pM which may be compared with a range of 1.5-30 pM for HLA-DR induction. The same prominent proteins are also induced by type I interferons. The 53 kD protein complex appears to consist of at least 4 different proteins, one of which is phosphorylated and another one of which is not induced in fibroblasts treated with IFN-gamma. We could obtain no evidence that the proteins were related by glycosylation. The presence of these proteins provides a sensitive means of identifying keratinocytes responding to interferons. Lack of these proteins in normal epidermis indicates that interferon does not play a major role in the control of keratinocyte behavior in sound skin.\r"

  ".W": "There is increasing evidence that derivatives of 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, the eicosanoids, play an important role in the inflammatory responses of the human skin. To better understand the metabolic fate of fatty acids in the skin, the effect of ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation (280-320 nm) on the distribution and release of 14C-labeled arachidonic acid, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid in human keratinocytes in culture was investigated. Ultraviolet B irradiation induced the release of all three 14C-labeled fatty acids from the phospholipids, especially from phosphatidylethanolamine, and this was accompanied by increased labeling of the nonphosphorus lipids. This finding suggests that UVB induces a significant liberation of eicosanoid precursor fatty acids from cellular phospholipids, but the liberated fatty acids are largely reincorporated into the nonphosphorus lipids. In conclusion, the present study suggests that not only arachidonic acid but also dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid might be involved in the UVB irradiation-induced inflammatory reactions of human skin.\r"

The time course of the ulceration, regeneration, and repair of the mouse skin following ulceration by either method was evaluated utilizing morphologic and autoradiographic techniques. The labeling index of the epidermis, using [3H]-thymidine and autoradiography, reached a maximum level 7 days after ulceration and the epidermal hyperplasia was most pronounced at days 7-14. The potential initiating activity of freeze ulceration or incision was evaluated by performing these procedures on 7-week-old female Sencar mice followed by promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) applied twice a week to the ulcerated areas, 5.2 micrograms in each application. Extending the total experimental observation to 1 year indicated that freeze ulceration and incision did not initiate carcinogenesis in the mouse skin when promoted with TPA.\r"

The rats were treated for five or 10 days with procaine penicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, rifampin, or ciprofloxacin (alone or in various combinations), or with penicillin plus clavulanic acid. The levels of penicillin in serum and vegetations declined rapidly in the beta L+-infected rats treated with procaine penicillin alone, unlike the sustained levels of penicillin in either beta L- -infected rats treated with procaine penicillin or beta L+-infected rats treated with penicillin plus clavulanic acid. For the beta L+-infected rats, the enterococcal counts in vegetations were significantly reduced (greater than 3 log10 cfu/g) only by vancomycin and by penicillin plus clavulanic acid. The efficacy of the latter regimen probably resulted from the inhibition of penicillin inactivation by clavulanic acid in vegetations infected with the beta L+ strain. Our in vivo findings document the biologic significance of beta-lactamase production.\r"

  ".W": "The contributions of complement-dependent phagocytosis and serum bactericidal activity (SBA) to the killing of 62 strains of meningococci were examined by using C8-depleted or pooled human serum (PHS). The complement-dependent nature of killing by neutrophils was confirmed by restoring survival to control values by using heated serum. Serogroups B and 29E, but not A, C, Y, and W135, were ingested and killed by neutrophils in C8-depleted PHS (PHS-C8Dep; 41.7% +/- 7.3% and 60.5% +/- 17.8% vs. greater than or equal to 100% survival, respectively, at 30 min). Group B meningococci were resistant to complement-mediated SBA, whereas group Y were susceptible. Deposition of C3 on serogroups B and Y was similar (28.5 +/- 2.9 vs. 23.5 +/- 2.7 C3 fluorescence units; P greater than .05); however, susceptibility to complement-dependent phagocytosis and complement-mediated SBA of serogroups B and Y did not correlate. We also examined meningococcal phagocytosis by using serum from a C8-deficient patient. In contrast to PHS-C8Dep, this serum supported rapid phagocytic killing of serogroups A, C, Y, and W135 meningococci. This finding suggests that vaccinating individuals deficient in late-complement components may shift the burden of host defense from SBA to phagocytosis.\r"

Using western blot analysis, we found that nine of 13 patients developed new serum IgG antibodies against one or more antigens, most commonly against lipooligosaccharide, followed in order by the H.8-antigen, pili, proteins I and II, and protein III. Twelve of 13 patients had preexisting IgG to gonococcal antigens, most commonly against the H.8 antigen, followed by pili, lipooligosaccharide, protein I, and protein III. Using serum obtained from other patients before and after nasopharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis, we demonstrated that carriage resulted in serum IgG cross-reactive to N. gonorrhoeae antigens. This is likely explanation for the presence of antigen-specific antibody in preinfection sera.\r"

By an ELISA, the murine immune response revealed an IgG titer of 5,120 to protein F by day 30. Immunoblot analysis of antisera from protein F-immunized mice revealed bands with both protein F and protein H of cell envelopes of all immunotypes tested. Active immunization with OM protein H did not, however, afford significant protection to mice in this burned mouse model.

All patients had symptoms from their lung disease but had no sleep complaints. Their mean age was 61 years, mean 1-second forced expiratory volume was 42% of predicted, and mean functional residual capacity 195% of predicted. Arterial Pco2 averaged 40 +/- 1 (SEM) mm Hg and mean Po2 64 +/- 1 mm Hg. Sleep was monitored for 7 hours by standard techniques on 2 nights 1 week apart. Breathing was assessed by measuring airflow at the nose and mouth with thermistors, and rib cage and abdominal respiratory movements with inductive plethysmography. Oxygen saturation was measured with an ear oximeter. Patients slept on the average 58% of the time in the first night and 63% in the second. Arousals were common but apneas uncommon in both nights. There was no significant difference in median nocturnal O2 saturation on the 2 nights. Tidal volume and minute ventilation, but not respiratory rate, were significantly lower and more variable in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep as compared with wakefulness and non-REM sleep; however, mean values and the variance for tidal volume, respiratory rate, or minute ventilation were similar on both nights.\r"

  ".W": "During the years 1972-1985, 50 patients with malignant external otitis (MEO) were seen in our department. All our patients complained of severe earache; they presented initially with an apparently simple external otitis, but failed to improve when the usual measures were adopted. They all presented with granulation tissue in the external ear canal, and five of our patients had multiple cranial nerve involvement. MEO is in effect a severe external otitis which, if untreated, proceeds towards an osteomyelitis of the skull base. MEO is more prevalent in the summer, when external otitis is rampant. In some years, a relatively large number of these patients appear; in others there are none. The reason for this is unknown. In Israel, the disease is more prevalent in Jews than in Arabs. Diabetes was present in 68 per cent of our patients-severe diabetes in 42 per cent, mild diabetes in 26 per cent but 32 per cent of our patients were diabetes-free. The only otological past history in our patients was of a recent traumatic insult to the external ear canal; this was the case in about 8 per cent of them. Today, the treatment of choice of this important disease is local debridement supplemented by appropriate antibiotic treatment for 6-8 weeks. This should include some semi-synthetic penicillin to which pseudomonas aeruginosa is sensitive, combined with an appropriate aminoglycoside. During the earlier years of our encounter with MEO, two of our 10 patients died of it; later on, when we learned better how to treat it, the mortality rate decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The obligatory criteria are: pain, edema, exudate, granulations, microabscess (when operated), positive bone scan or failure of local treatment often more than 1 week, and possibly pseudomonas in culture. The occasional criteria are diabetes, cranial nerve involvement, positive radiograph, debilitating condition and old age. All of the obligatory criteria must be present in order to establish the diagnosis. The presence of occasional criteria alone does not establish it. The importance of Tc99 scan in detecting osteomyelitis is stressed. When bone scan is not available, a trial of 1-3 weeks of local treatment is suggested. Failure to respond to such treatment may assist in making the diagnosis of MEO.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-three elderly patients (aged more than 65 years) who manifested primary hypothyroidism during 4 1/2 years from September 1980 to March 1985 were studied. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the presence or absence of chronic associated disorder at the time of diagnosis. Patients in the sick group were required to consume several medications throughout the study period in addition to L-thyroxine for their total therapeutic management. Subjects in the healthy group required L-thyroxine administration alone for their therapy. Prior to institution of L-thyroxine therapy, serum thyroxine (T4) was not significantly different in the two groups. However, serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were significantly lower and T3 resin uptake was significantly higher in the sick group compared with the healthy patients (P less than .01 for all comparisons). Furthermore, these differences in T3, TSH concentration, and T3 resin uptake values appeared to persist on achieving euthyroid state. The optimal daily L-thyroxine dose was markedly lower (97 +/- 3 micrograms) in the sick patients compared with the healthy group (144 +/- 3 micrograms) as well as with the younger counterparts reported in the literature (150 +/- 8 micrograms). These findings indicate that the decrease in optimal daily L-thyroxine dosage reported in previous studies is not a universal finding in all elderly hypothyroid patients; the decrease is present only in patients with associated chronic disorders, and hence may be attributed to the presence of an associated chronic disorder or medications consumed for treatment of these disorders rather than old age.\r"

Retrospective analysis of all 233 cases (20%) with liver metastases was done to correlate various clinical and biochemical characteristics with response to treatment, survival, and causes of death. A similar analysis was performed for 58 consecutive patients with liver metastases treated at this hospital between December 1955 and December 1957 with hormone therapy or single-agent chemotherapy. Objective responses were observed in 132 of 233 patients (57%) treated with combination chemotherapy. The median survival was 14 months in the 1970s and 5 months in the 1950s. Among patients who had liver metastases at the time of initial diagnosis of breast cancer, survival was longer for the group treated with combination chemotherapy. All cases were classified according to the number of organ sites involved by metastases. Patients with only liver metastases, or liver plus bone lesions had the longest survival. Other clinical and biochemical factors that correlated significantly with longer survival were: no prior chemotherapy, performance status of 1 to 2, absence of ascites, normal bilirubin and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), SGOT less than or equal to 2 times normal and albumin greater than 4.5 g/dL. The main cause of death was multiorgan failure, with only 20% of patients dying of liver failure. The present study shows that the presence of liver metastases in breast cancer is not by itself an ominous factor. Most patients respond to therapy, and significant palliation with extended survival is possible for several prognostic subgroups. Further improvement in length and quality of survival is expected with earlier diagnosis.\r"

It has relatively weak antiviral properties, yet relatively potent immunomodulatory effects. A phase I trial was performed with r-GIFN (specific activity 2.6 X 10(6) IU/mg protein), administered as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 24 hours for five days (Cl X 5) and repeated every 28 days. This schedule was chosen based on the short half-life of r-GIFN in animal systems and the in vitro augmentation of biologic effects with continuous exposure to interferons. Twenty-one patients with refractory solid tumors received 46 evaluable courses of therapy. The dose-limiting toxicities included fever, flu-like symptoms, cardiovascular toxicity, and neurotoxicity. The cardiovascular toxicity included hypotension and one episode of cardiac ischemia with chest pain. Neurotoxicity consisted of lethargy and confusion. These toxicities were reversible, and although dose-limiting, occurred sporadically throughout all dosage levels. Mild to moderately severe non-dose-limiting toxicities included nausea and vomiting, leukopenia, and liver function abnormalities. Other infrequent toxicities included hypocalcemia, diarrhea, constipation, and alopecia. The maximally tolerated dose of r-GIFN on this schedule is 0.5 X 10(6) IU/m2/d. Partial responses were seen in one patient with metastatic melanoma and in one patient with renal cell carcinoma. Toxicity and antitumor activity were seen at doses where interferon serum levels could not be detected by radioimmunoassay. In addition, the toxicity and antitumor activity seen were at much lower doses than previously described for shorter infusion schedules of other recombinant gamma interferon preparations. Differences in biologic activity of interferon preparations and/or differences in scheduling may account for this variability. Although this study defines a recommended phase II dose of r-GIFN based on the maximally tolerated dose, the optimal therapeutic index may exist at a lower dosage level.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the possibility of continuing oxazaphosphorine therapy in patients with previously documented cyclophosphamide- or ifosfamide-induced hematuria by concomitant use of the uroprotective agent, mesna. Twenty-six patients with oxazaphosphorine-induced hematuria received additional cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide with mesna. Twelve, who had previously experienced hematuria with ifosfamide, received a median of 3.5 more cycles of ifosfamide/mesna. One patient developed further hematuria (grade 1). Of seven patients who experienced acute hematuria with cyclophosphamide, one experienced further hematuria after an additional course of cyclophosphamide with mesna, but none of the other six patients developed further hematuria when administered either cyclophosphamide/mesna (two) or ifosfamide/mesna (four). Seven patients who had chronic cyclophosphamide-induced hematuria had further oxazaphosphorine with mesna without worsening of their hematuria. Mesna is an effective uroprotective agent that prevents recurrent acute hemorrhagic cystitis, or worsening of chronic hemorrhagic cystitis, in patients receiving further oxazaphosphorine after previous ifosfamide- or cyclophosphamide-induced hematuria.\r"

  ".W": "Extracts from 15 human cerebral tumors were tested by a fibrin-plate plasminogen-dependent assay for levels of tumor plasminogen activator (TPA) activity. The TPA activity was correlated with the amount of perineoplastic edema as quantified on computerized tomography (CT) brain scanning. Analysis of the results showed a correlation coefficient of 0.72 when all tumors were included. Analysis of the nine tumors with the highest TPA levels showed a correlation coefficient of 0.96. One metastatic tumor had the highest level of TPA activity, equivalent to a pure 100-micrograms/ml solution of urokinase, and the greatest amount of cerebral edema on CT. Meningiomas generally had the next highest levels of TPA activity and edema, followed by astrocytomas of varying grades, which generally had the lowest level of TPA activity. However, three astrocytomas that had low TPA activity also had significant edema surrounding the tumor, indicating that more than one mechanism may be producing peritumoral edema. There was no correlation between tumor size and the amount of perineoplastic edema. These preliminary results suggest that TPA's may be involved in the production of perineoplastic cerebral edema and that treatment of patients with currently available plasminogen activator inhibitors may be successful in reducing peritumoral edema.\r"

  ".W": "Indium-111 leukocyte scanning has evolved into a practical and highly accurate method for the identification of infectious and inflammatory processes. The most commonly used agent for labeling leukocytes has been [111In]oxine. We have investigated a newer agent, 2-mercaptopyridine-N-oxide (Merc) at our institution which unlike oxine, allows us to label leukocytes in plasma, using a simple kit procedure. Of the 92 consecutive patients referred for detection or localization of an infectious process, autologous leukocytes of 55 patients were labeled with [111In]Merc, while those of the remaining 37 patients were labeled with [111In]oxine. The sensitivities for Merc and oxine procedures were 87% and 92%, respectively, while the respective specificities were 100% and 92%. We conclude that the [111In]Merc-labeled leukocytes are equally effective as [111In]oxine-labeled leukocytes in detecting infectious processes. The use of [111In]Merc is advantageous over [111In]oxine for white blood cell labeling because of its easier preparation.\r"

We therefore undertook a retrospective review to determine the frequency and significance of such \"cold\" defects on 111In-labeled leukocyte imaging. Three hundred thirty-two scans on 290 patients were reviewed and 40 cases of decreased activity involving bone were found, for an incidence of 12%. The causes of the defects were: fracture (eight), nontraumatic avascular necrosis (eight), solid tumor (six), prostheses and other orthopedic hardware (four), advanced age (four), radiation (three), leukemia (two), osteomyelitis (two), myelofibrosis (one), postlaminectomy (one), and idiopathic (one). To determine the frequency of cold defects in osteomyelitis, all 15 cases of osteomyelitis in this series were reviewed and 12 showed increased activity, two were cold, and one was normoactive. Thus, 14% of cases of osteomyelitis presented as cold defects. We conclude that cold bone defects do occur on 111In-labeled leukocyte scans and that the causes of such defects are similar to those reported for bone and bone marrow scanning.\r"

  ".W": "B72.3, a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) that reacts with 85% of human colon carcinomas as well as other epithelial neoplasias, was labeled with 111In using four chelating agents: 1-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-DTPA (SCN-Bz-DTPA), isobutylcarboxycarbonic anhydride (MA-DTPA), cyclic anhydride (CA-DTPA), and 1-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (SCN-Bz-EDTA). Comparative biodistribution and imaging studies were performed in athymic mice bearing human colon carcinoma xenografts (LS-174T). Tumor uptake of radiolabel was very similar between the chelates (30% ID/g) and tumors were identified in scintigraphic images with all the chelate-antibody complexes. The uptake by normal organs, especially the liver, was greater for MA-DTPA, CA-DTPA, and SCN-Bz-EDTA chelate-B72.3 IgG (1.3:1 to 2.5:1) in comparison to that found with the B72.3-SCN-Bz-DTPA (approximately 5:1) and abdominal organ, and uptake was very prominent on imaging with these chelate-MAb complexes but was virtually absent in the mice injected with B72.3-SCN-Bz-DTPA. Purification of the MAb-chelate complex by Sephadex G-50 chromatography followed by HPLC using a TSK-3000 column provided better subsequent biodistribution and also resulted in clearer images as compared to MAb chelate complexes purified by less rigorous purification protocols. We conclude that the 111In-SCN-Bz-DTPA complex is superior, at least when bound to MAb B72.3, to other chelate-complexes currently in use.\r"

After aerosolization (0.8 m MMD, 2.4 GSD), clearance was determined for 30 min and then corrected by intravenous injection for nonairspace radioactivity. In-TF clearance (0.11 +/- 0.10%/min) was lower than TcO4 (6.32 +/- 0.62%/min), [99mTc]GH (1.50 +/- 0.37%/min), [51Cr]EDTA (2.38 +/- 1.02%/min), [99mTc]DTPA (3.51 +/- 0.40%/min), [111In]DTPA (2.35 +/- 0.42%/min), [67Ga] DFOM (1.99 +/- 0.49%/min) and [99mTc]DX (1.81 +/- 0.75%/min) clearances (p less than 0.001). TcO4 clearance was higher than others (p less than 0.001). Technetium binding to DX was unsatisfactory; aerosolization caused unbinding from DTPA. We conclude that respiratory clearance of large mol wt solutes within 30 min is negligible and, that clearance of molecules between 347-5,099 daltons differs greatly, suggesting that binding and/or intrapulmonary retention affect transfer.\r"

Intrinsically labeled kernels were harvested from plants grown in 59Fe-labeled nutrient solutions. The varieties used were selected from 18 varieties of field-grown wheat grain that were analyzed for iron, protein and phytate content. Concentrations of iron, phytate and protein in grain of field-grown varieties ranged from 34 to 55 ppm, 0.7 to 1.2% dry wt and 11.3 to 15.4% dry wt, respectively. In grain from varieties grown in nutrient solutions, iron, phytate and protein concentrations ranged from 35 to 50 ppm, 1 to 1.2% dry wt, and 13.8 to 16.8% dry wt, respectively. Depending on the variety of intrinsically labeled grain fed in test meals to anemic rats (hemoglobin averaged 5.8 g/dL), absorption of 59Fe ranged from about 62 to 74% of the dose; differences among varieties were not significant (P greater than 0.05). Rats fed 59Fe-labeled FeCl3 absorbed about 71% of the dose, which was similar to the average amount (69% of dose) absorbed by rats fed wheat. We concluded that selection of wheat varieties for increased yield or protein content has not adversely affected the bioavailability of iron in the grain.\r"

In incubations of rat hepatocytes with cysteinesulfinate, the rate of hypotaurine plus taurine production was approximately the same as the rate of conversion of the 1-carbon of cysteinesulfinate to CO2. In contrast, no significant production of hypotaurine plus taurine occurred in incubations of cat hepatocytes with cysteinesulfinate. These data are consistent with the species difference in the activity of hepatic cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase, which converts cysteinesulfinate to hypotaurine. In incubations of either rat or cat hepatocytes with cysteine, no hypotaurine plus taurine production was detected. However, the 1-carbon of cysteine was converted to CO2 and the production of urea plus ammonia nitrogen was significantly increased over the rates observed in incubations of cells without substrate. Our results suggest that most cysteine oxidation by hepatocytes occurs by pathways that do not involve formation of cysteinesulfinate.\r"

The binding of DMBA to isolated mammary cell DNA after 6 h of incubation from rats fed 15% dietary protein was 20% higher than binding from cells of rats fed 7.5% dietary protein. The increased binding in mammary epithelial cells from rats fed 15% protein was associated with an increase in the syn-dihydrodiol-epoxide adduct. The syn-dihydrodiol-epoxide:deoxyadenosine adduct was the major contributor to binding. The present studies are consistent with a decrease in carcinogen activation in tissues obtained from animals fed diets limiting in protein.\r"

Such infants may have life styles not substantially different from those of normal children. In others, the benefit from this operation, if any, is short lived. These infants are very vulnerable to the debilitating effects of severe, prolonged malabsorption and ultimately require orthotopic liver transplantation to sustain life. The physician caring for infants awaiting liver transplantation can do much, not only to prolong survival but to maintain satisfactory growth and development. The key consideration is to provide adequate nitrogen and nonnitrogen calories, liberally utilizing modern methods of enteral alimentation when necessary. In addition, attention must be directed toward several vitamin and mineral deficiencies, particularly those of the fat-soluble vitamins, that inevitably accompany severe malabsorption in children. Management of extrahepatic biliary atresia in infants is difficult and requires meticulous attention to details. Nevertheless, the long-term cure of this disorder provided by liver transplantation makes their care a rewarding experience.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the ability of dicloxacillin, a beta-lactamase-resistant penicillin, to eradicate persistent group A streptococci from the upper respiratory tract of children previously given penicillin V, and concomitantly assessed the role of antibiotic (penicillin and dicloxacillin) tolerance as a contributing factor. During a group A streptococcal pharyngitis outbreak, 66% of 324 children were found to be culture positive for group A streptococci. Ninety percent of these isolates were serotype M-1, T-agglutination pattern T-1. The treatment failure rate after initial orally administered penicillin treatment was 21% (42 of 204). These 42 children then received either a second course of penicillin V orally or a course of dicloxacillin. The resulting rates of failure to eradicate the homologous streptococcal serotype were 83% (20 of 24) and 50% (9 of 18), respectively (P less than 0.02). Of 189 streptococcal isolates tested by the gradient replicate plate method for penicillin tolerance, 18 (10%) were tolerant. In this study, penicillin-tolerant strains of group A streptococci were no more frequently isolated from children in whom initial penicillin treatment failed than from those who were successfully treated. Dicloxacillin tolerance was not a factor in failure of dicloxacillin therapy. These data, when evaluated with data from previous studies, suggest that reasons for failure to eradicate group A streptococci from the upper respiratory tract are complex, but dicloxacillin may be beneficial in some patients who fail to respond to orally administered penicillin therapy.\r"

The goal was to test whether chemicals that increase entry of Na+ or Ca++ into nerve terminals would shorten the latent period that precedes the onset of MeHg-induced increase in MEPP frequency. Administration of MeHg (100 microM) with A23187 (25 microM), a calcium ionophore, caused a more rapid time to peak induced increase in MEPP frequency than \"control\" MeHg preparations. This effect also occurred in solutions to which no extracellular Ca++ was added. Use of monensin, a Na+ ionophore (25-100 microM), did not shorten the time to peak increase of MEPP frequency. The dihydropyridine Ca++ channel agonist Bay K 8644 (750 nM) produced the most marked shortening of the time to peak MEPP frequency for MeHg. This effect also occurred in solutions deficient in extracellular Ca++. Veratridine (20 microM), a sodium channel activator, decreased the time to peak MEPP frequency when used in conjunction with MeHg in both Ca++-containing and Ca++-deficient solutions. Replacement of sodium in the extracellular perfusion solution with methylamine, which does not penetrate axon sodium channels, did not prevent the MeHg-induced increase in MEPP frequency although it did prolong the time to peak increase and decreased the maximal MEPP frequency induced by MeHg compared with experiments conducted in sodium-containing solutions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Binding affinities were 0.66 and 138 nM at 15 degrees C and 9.1 and 72 nM at 37 degrees C, for the high and low affinity sites, respectively, and binding site densities were 0.3 and 14 pmol/mg at 15 degrees C and 0.41 and 1.4 pmol/mg at 37 degrees C, for the respective sites. The modification of high affinity [3H]BAY K 8644 binding by verapamil, diltiazem, tiapamil, Ca++ and EDTA appeared to be the same as that for nitrendipine binding, consistent with the hypothesis that the high affinity binding site for [3H]BAY K 8644 on isolated membranes is the same as the 1,4-dihydropyridine antagonist binding site. The binding of [3H]BAY K 8644 to a low affinity binding site was modified by temperature, Ca++ and diltiazem, but the lack of stereoselectivity, lack of denaturation by heat and the large number of sites indicated that most of the low affinity binding sites were not associated with Ca++ channels. It is concluded that the high affinity binding site for BAY K 8644 is associated with Ca++ channels, and is modified by at least some of the factors that modify the binding site for Ca++ channel antagonists, whereas many or all of the low affinity binding sites detected are not related to Ca++ channels.\r"

  ".W": "5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) stimulates the accumulation of inositol-trisphosphate in WRK1 cells, a cell line originating from a rat mammary tumor. 5-HT acts via a single receptor type for which it has an affinity constant estimated to be 1.27 microM. A series of agonists known to act at 5-HT2 receptors are partial agonists in this system and have a rank order of relative intrinsic efficacies corresponding to that seen in other systems possessing 5-HT2 receptors. There is an essentially linear occupancy-response relationship for 5-HT and other agonists indicating the absence of a strong amplification mechanism between receptor activation and inositol phosphate formation. The selective blockade of the 5-HT response by nanomolar concentrations of 5-HT2 selective antagonists but not by drugs acting at other 5-HT receptor subtypes suggest that the receptor in WRK1 cells is of the 5-HT2 type. Additionally, we demonstrate that in WRK1 membranes 5-HT acts via the 5-HT2 receptor to elicit a GTP dependent increase in the production of inositol-bisphosphate and inositol-trisphosphate. These properties of the WRK1 cell line indicate that it is a useful model with which to study the nature of 5-HT receptor coupling to the putative second messenger(s), the inositol phosphates.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied the relation between physicochemical properties and lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) after topical application to rabbit in a series of 5-acylimino- and related imino-substituted analogs of methazolamide (Compound 4). All had Ki vs. carbonic anhydrase C of about 10(-8) M. The parent, methazolamide (5-acetyl) does not lower IOP, in contrast to the 5-CF3 acetyl compound (Compound 28). The 5-propionyl compound (6) unexpectedly was 3 times more water soluble than methazolamide and had 10 times greater CHCl3-buffer partition. The in vivo transcorneal permeability constant was 6 times greater than methazolamide. One hour after 1 drop of a 2% suspension of Compound 6, anterior aqueous concentration (in micromolar) was 69 (for methazolamide, 8), posterior aqueous was 19 and ciliary process was 17. IOP dropped 2.2 mm Hg and returned to normal in 4 hr. Other compounds in the series showed varying degrees of activity, ranging from Compound 28, which elicited an IOP fall of 3.5 mm Hg, to Compound 7, (n-pentyryl), for which the fall was 1.3 mm Hg. Also studied are substitutions for CH3 on the ring N at position 4. There are multiple criteria for in vivo activity; a major factor is the balance between water and lipid solubility. The methazolamide analogs are compared with benzothiazole-2-sulfonamides, another class under investigation as topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors designed to treat glaucoma.\r"

PMA, but not 4 alpha-phorbol, suppressed muscarinic receptor-mediated cyclic GMP responses in a time-dependent and a concentration-dependent fashion with an IC50 of 68.8 +/- 20.2 nM. The inhibitory effects of PMA on CBC-induced cyclic GMP formation were of a mixed competitive and noncompetitive type, being characterized by a depression of maximal cyclic GMP response to CBC and a significant increase in its EC50. PMA also significantly reduced [3H]cyclic GMP formation induced by histamine, without affecting the responses elicited either by sodium azide or the calcium ionophore A23187. Although the inhibitory effects of PMA on CBC-induced cyclic GMP formation were not reversed by washing, these effects were significantly attenuated by H-7 [1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine], a protein kinase C inhibitor. PMA had no effect on binding of an antagonist ligand to muscarinic receptors, or on the binding characteristics of CBC to these receptors in intact cells. On the other hand, PMA competed for the specific binding of a labeled phorbol ester in intact cells with a potency similar to that of PMA in inhibiting muscarinic receptor-mediated [3H]cyclic GMP responses.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of age on cholinergic endothelium-mediated relaxation was examined in vitro using blood vessels from Fischer 344 rats ranging in age from 1 to 27 months. Although no differences were seen in contractile response to alpha adrenergic agonists, both aortic ring segments and perfused caudal arteries showed an increase in sensitivity of endothelium-mediated relaxation to the cholinergic agonist methacholine. This increase in sensitivity occurs between the ages of 6 and 12 months, with no further significant increase in sensitivity up to 27 months of age, suggesting it is a consequence of growth and development rather than old age. No difference with age in cholinergic relaxation was observed in the perfused mesenteric bed, indicating either no change of sensitivity in smaller resistance vessels or an effect that is hidden in this more complex perfused system. In contrast to findings with cholinergic stimulation, responses of the perfused caudal artery to the calcium ionophore A23187 were not altered with age. This suggests that the alteration with age in response to methacholine involves the muscarinic receptor or receptor-coupling mechanism rather than the generation of, or response to, endothelium-derived relaxing factor.\r"

  ".W": "Ca++-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent stimulation of adenylate cyclase in rat cerebellar plasma membranes was demonstrated by removal of endogenous Ca++ and CaM and addition of exogenous Ca++ and CaM to the membranes. This CaM-dependent adenylate cyclase activity could be inhibited by calmidazolium and trifluoperazine in an apparently competitive manner, whereas the inhibition produced by W-7 was not competitive. The potency of the antagonists was strictly dependent upon the concentration of exogenous CaM present in the assay. Preincubation of membranes with exogenous CaM, followed by addition of anti-CaM agents, greatly reduced the inhibition of CaM-dependent adenylate cyclase activity. The potency of the anti-CaM agents was further decreased in membranes that had not been depleted of endogenous Ca++ and CaM (native membranes). The results suggest that optimal inhibition of CaM-dependent adenylate cyclase activity occurs upon simultaneous addition of exogenous CaM and anti-CaM agents to membranes depleted of endogenous Ca++ and CaM. Association of CaM with the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase before introduction of CaM antagonists results in a CaM-C complex that is relatively refractory to inhibition by these anti-CaM agents. This CaM-catalytic unit complex probably exists in native membranes, rendering the antagonism of adenylate cyclase activity supported by endogenous Ca++-CaM essentially insensitive to low concentrations of CaM antagonists.\r"

  ".W": "Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has a variety of biologic effects which are both dependent and independent on activation of adenylate cyclase. We studied the effects of intact PTH and PTH fragments on water flow and Ca transport in isolated toad bladder sacs. As reported previously by us, PTH (1-84) significantly stimulated basal water flow in isolated toad bladder sacs. Synthetic PTH 1-34, 44-68, 53-84 and 65-84 (1 microgram/ml) had no effect on basal water flow after a 60-min incubation period. Intact PTH (1-84) and synthetic 1-34 PTH significantly inhibited both arginine-vasopressin and cyclic AMP-stimulated water flow. Synthetic PTH 44-68, 53-84 and 65-84 (1 microgram m/ml) had no effect on arginine-vasopressin or cyclic AMP-stimulated water flow after a 60-min incubation. Intact PTH (1-84) and synthetic 1-34 PTH significantly stimulated 45Ca uptake without affecting 45Ca efflux. Synthetic PTH 44-68, 53-84 and 65-84 had no effect on either 45Ca uptake or 45Ca efflux. Although these results suggest that the intact hormone is required for the maximal effect of PTH on water flow, substantial activity resides in the amino terminal fragment of the hormone. No activity per se resides in the carboxy terminal portion of the hormone as regards water flow. Alterations in Ca transport appear to mediate the effect of PTH on water flow. These effects are independent of activation of adenylate cyclase because these hormones also inhibit cyclic AMP-stimulated water flow.\r"

The effects of varying doses of AF administered to rats by either the p.o. or the i.p. route on heme metabolism were determined. Twenty four hours after a single dose of AF, decreases in the sulfhydryl-containing enzymes, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and ferrochelatase activities were observed in the liver and kidneys. These decreases in heme biosynthetic enzymes were accompanied by decreases in cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymic activities and increases in microsomal heme oxygenase activity. These changes were observed with AF dosages as low as 5 mg/kg, with maximal changes occurring at a p.o. dose of about 15 mg of AF per kg and an i.p. dose of 5 to 10 mg of AF per kg. Dose-response studies with AuTM showed that maximal changes in heme metabolism occur at a lower dose of AF than of AuTM, even though AF was administered p.o. and AuTM was administered parenterally. In addition, the kidneys appeared to be more susceptible to the inhibitory effects of the two chrysotherapeutic agents than did the liver. The present studies demonstrate the p.o. drug AF affects heme metabolism in a manner similar to that reported previously with the parenterally administered AuTM.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of bradykinin on the neuroeffector junction of the isolated rat vas deferens was studied in tissues stimulated transmurally at a frequency of 0.15 Hz. Bradykinin caused two distinct and independent actions: it potentiated the magnitude of the muscular response to the electrically driven twitches and, in addition, contracted the smooth muscle generating an increased muscular tone. The former action is referred to as the neurogenic or presynaptic effect, whereas the latter effect is called the musculotropic or postjunctional action. The neurogenic effect was abolished by tetrodotoxin or tissue denervation either by cold storage or chemical sympathectomy after 6-hydroxydopamine administration. However, these procedures did not significantly modify the musculotropic potency of bradykinin. Both actions of the peptide are receptor-mediated, as minor structural modifications in the amino acid sequence caused significant changes in biological potency. In addition, the peptide analog, [Thi5,8-D-Phe7]-bradykinin, behaved as an agonist at the presynaptic site but as an antagonist at the muscular site. The most potent peptide analog to produce the neurogenic effect was Met-Lys-bradykinin followed by Lys-bradykinin and [Tyr8]-bradykinin. In contrast, the potency of these peptide analogs acting at the postsynaptic site was about the same. des Arg9 bradykinin and des Arg9-[Leu8]-bradykinin were inactive at the pre- and postjunctional site. The neurogenic action of bradykinin was not mimicked by angiotensin II, neurotensin, substance P or vasopressin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sulfinpyrazone (100 microM) and its thioether metabolite G25671 (50 microM) suppressed arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation, thromboxane (Tx) B2 formation and ATP release. Platelet activation by the endoperoxide analog U46619 also was prevented by sulfinpyrazone or G25671 (0.3-1 mM). Previous studies have shown that human platelets pre-exposed to arachidonic acid or to U46619 and then washed and resuspended failed to respond to a second challenge by both arachidonic acid and U46619; desensitization by arachidonic acid and U46619 occurred at a site sensitive to endoperoxides/Tx receptor antagonists; and the desensitizing effects of U46619 were direct, whereas those of arachidonic acid were mediated by a cyclooxygenase-dependent metabolite. We now demonstrate that the presence of sulfinpyrazone or G25671 during platelet exposure to arachidonic acid or U46619 prevented desensitization. We also studied the threshold aggregating concentration of arachidonic acid and U46619 in healthy subjects before and after treatment with sulfinpyrazone and we found a good correlation between ex vivo and in vitro findings. We finally examined the actions of sulfinpyrazone and G25671 on the bronchoconstriction in vivo and parenchymal lung strip contraction in vitro induced by U46619. Neither drug had any preventive effect. Our results demonstrate that sulfinpyrazone and its metabolite G25671 are not only cyclooxygenase inhibitors but can also act as endoperoxide/Tx antagonists and indicate clearly that antagonism of U46619 by both drugs is selective for platelets.\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of trauma care must be an integral part of any system designed for care of seriously injured patients. However, outcome review should offer comparability to national standards or norms. The TRISS method offers a standard approach for evaluating outcome of trauma care. Anatomic, physiologic, and age characteristics are used to quantify probability of survival as related to severity of injury. TRISS offers a means of case identification for quality assurance review on a local basis, as well as a means of comparison of outcome for different populations of trauma patients. Methods for calculating statistics associated with TRISS are presented. The Z and M statistics are explained with the nonstatistician in mind. We feel this article is a source for those interested in developing or upgrading trauma care evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "A second suppressive state (S-SupS) in interferon (IFN) response was demonstrated when mice with third-degree burns of approximately 30% of the body surface area (TI-mice) were stimulated in vivo by Staphylococcal enterotoxin A, a gamma IFN inducer. The first suppressive state in IFN production, appearing 3 to 7 days after thermal injury, was mediated by the generation of splenic suppressor macrophages. The S-SupS was demonstrated approximately 3 weeks post thermal injury. It persisted for almost 3 weeks and gradually disappeared by 7 weeks. Spleen cells from mice during the S-SupS produced less IFN in vitro than normal mouse splenic mononuclear cells (MNC) when stimulated with concanavalin A (Con A). Splenic MNC of mice during the S-SupS inhibited IFN production when they were co-cultured with normal mouse splenic MNC in the presence of Con A. Since this suppressor cell activity could not be removed from TI-mice splenic MNC by carbonyl iron treatment, or by a technique of adherence to a plastic surface, it is suggested that two different cell populations which are capable of suppressing the IFN response of TI-mice exist at different time periods following burn injury.\r"

  ".W": "When samples were taken within 2 hr of accidental injury, plasma cortisol levels increased with injury severity score (ISS) in patients with minor and moderate injuries (ISS, 1-12) but decreased at higher ISS. Radioimmunoassay of adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) showed very variable plasma concentrations at all ISS ranges. Like cortisol, ACTH increased with ISS up to a score of about 13, but it thereafter plateaued, and in patients with severe injuries plasma cortisol fell in relation to ACTH as well as in absolute terms. This suggested that although ACTH secretion was generally far from maximal the relatively low cortisol concentrations in the most severely injured were at least partly due to a poor response of the adrenal cortex to ACTH. In patients who presented late (more than 2 hr after injury) plasma cortisol levels were more variable and more strongly related to ACTH than at shorter times after injury. The variability of cortisol also increased with age. Patients with severe head injuries had cortisol and ACTH concentrations similar to those without head injuries but with a similar ISS from injuries in other parts of the body.\r"

However, porphyrin excretion in humans after acute transient low level exposure has not been evaluated. Following such an exposure in which bystanders and firefighters were in contact with smoke from a PCB transformer fire, we surveyed 90 self-referred individuals by questionnaire and by determining single 24 hour urinary excretion of uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin 2-4 weeks after the fire. Questionnaire variables that assessed exposure were not associated with the magnitude of either uroporphyrin or coproporphyrin excretion. Uroporphyrin excretion was slightly elevated in nine subjects (range 66-106 micrograms/24 hours, normal less than 60), which is much less than in clinical cases of porphyria cutanea tarda. Uroporphyrin excretion was inversely correlated with coproporphyrin excretion (r = -0.3844, p = 0.0002). For 5 subjects (3 with elevated initial uroporphyrin excretion) retested at 3-4 weeks after the fire, all 5 showed increases in uroporphyrin and decreases in coproporphyrin excretion when compared to initial determinations. These two reciprocal relationships would be the expected result from inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, a known experimental effect of PCB and PCDF in mice. Overall, urinary porphyrin excretions were not altered or sensitive measures of exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Nine patients with renal pelvic transitional cell carcinomas were selected for treatment with percutaneous resection because of a solitary kidney (3), bilateral synchronous disease (1), renal insufficiency (1), poor surgical risk (2) or preoperative evidence of a single, low grade, superficial tumor (2). Eight patients underwent second-look procedures 2 to 28 days postoperatively, at which time 6 received neodymium: YAG laser irradiation. Supplemental intracavitary therapy through the nephrostomy tube was given in 6 patients (mitomycin C in 1 and bacillus Calmette-Guerin in 5). Of those patients 2 had third-look procedures. Five patients remain free of recurrence with a followup of 3 to 28 months (mean 9.5 months). In the other 4 patients there was recurrent disease in the renal pelvis (3) or reappearance of positive cytology studies (1) 4 to 5 months postoperatively. Extrarenal tumor recurrence was not observed. Percutaneous surgery provided adequate information to assess tumor architecture, grade, invasiveness and multifocality, and the presence of contiguous mucosal abnormalities, which, along with positive cytology and a history of or concurrent tumors in other segments of the urinary tract, increased the likelihood of tumor recurrence. Second-look procedures appeared to be useful to assess the effectiveness of the initial procedure and to remove any residual disease. Our results suggest that percutaneous surgery can provide results similar to those of an open conservative operation, although further investigation is needed to determine the ultimate place of this technique.\r"

  ".W": "The response to definitive radiation therapy of localized carcinoma of the prostate by 125iodine implantation or external beam radiotherapy was monitored by examining specimens from biopsies performed after treatment. We analyzed 126 biopsy specimens obtained 18 months or more after treatment: 71 were obtained from 109 patients treated by 125iodine and 55 from 197 patients treated by external beam radiotherapy. Thereafter, the disease status of these patients was examined at minimum 3-year intervals. No significant statistical difference was found between the negative specimen rates of the 2 treatment modalities: 46 of 71 (65 per cent) after 125iodine implantation and 39 of 55 (71 per cent) after external beam radiotherapy were negative. To analyze the predictive value of biopsy results 103 patients whose prostatic examination results were normal at biopsy or who showed regression of tumor size and tumor induration after radiation were evaluated. The biopsy results from all patients were combined for analysis. Of 77 patients with negative biopsy specimens 16 (21 per cent) have had recurrent disease, compared to 17 of 26 (65 per cent) with positive biopsy specimens (p equals 0.00005). Of the 77 patients with negative biopsy specimens 7 (9 per cent) had local disease recurrence, compared to 12 of 26 (46 per cent) with a positive biopsy specimen (p equals 0.0001). The value of a positive specimen to predict failure remained significant with patients stratified by pre-treatment clinical stage and grade of the disease. Our results show that patients with positive specimens from the prostate who had been judged clinically by rectal examination to have responded to radiation therapy had a significantly increased incidence of local and distant failure compared to patients who had negative biopsy specimens.\r"

  ".W": "We recruited 71 previously untreated patients with metastatic prostatic carcinoma to 2 separate consecutive prospective phase 2 studies done by the same group of investigators according to the same protocols in which only the treatment regimens differed. Of the patients 58 were treated with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue buserelin alone (0.4 mg. 3 times daily intranasally) and 13 were treated with buserelin combined with cyproterone acetate, a potent antiandrogen (50 mg. 3 times daily orally). The objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the medication used during at least 12 months by studying adequate endocrine parameters, the rate and duration of response, as well as the rate of progression and possible side effects. All endocrine parameters were studied in 1 laboratory. Modified response criteria of the National Prostatic Cancer Project were used. The endocrine studies showed an effective suppression of plasma testosterone to castration levels by buserelin after an initial increase during the first 2 weeks. Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormones were lowered significantly and could not be re-stimulated by the intravenous application of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. There was no correlation of plasma testosterone with response and progression. However, a significant correlation existed between higher basal cortisol levels at entry, and after 3 and 6 months, and progression. Response is reported for all patients at the 12-month interval and did not seem to differ among treatment groups. The rate of progression after all patients had been treated for 1 year was 37.9 per cent in the buserelin group and 41 per cent in the buserelin plus cyproterone acetate group. Three early deaths occurred in the buserelin group. Except for impotence, only mild side effects were noted. Our study shows that treatment of metastatic prostatic cancer by means of the luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone analogue buserelin is safe and effective. The results obtained are compatible with those obtained by castration. In our study a superiority of total androgen withdrawal over testicular suppression alone could not be shown.\r"

Each child was less than 2 years old at diagnosis, and each had stage I disease (localized to the testicle). Initial management consisted of radical inguinal orchiectomy in all 11 patients. Four patients then underwent retroperitoneal node dissection and none had pathological evidence of retroperitoneal tumor spread. After primary surgical management 5 patients received no further initial treatment. Of these 5 patients 3 are alive with no evidence of disease at 1.5, 2.7 and 4.5 years after diagnosis. The tumor recurred in 2 patients, 1 of whom was salvaged with pulmonary radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The other 6 patients received chemotherapy postoperatively and only 1 has suffered relapse. Over-all, of 3 patients in whom pulmonary metastases developed 1 died of tumor and 1 died of treatment-related pneumonopathy. Our experience and that of others have led us to conclude that patients with localized disease and normal postoperative serum alpha-fetoprotein levels do not benefit from retroperitoneal node dissection, postoperative abdominal irradiation or chemotherapy. Patients with retroperitoneal nodal involvement, widely metastatic disease or recurrent disease can be treated successfully with chemotherapy and in some cases with radiation therapy.\r"

A randomized, double-blind, crossover experimental design was utilized in 16 type II diabetic patients for a period of eight months. Treatment with glyburide, 20 mg/d (plus insulin), compared with placebo (plus insulin) resulted in a significant reduction in mean basal glucose (232 +/- 12 vs 262 +/- 11 mg/dL [12.8 vs 14.4 mmol/L]) and hemoglobin A1C (10.2% +/- 0.5% vs 10.9% +/- 03%) concentrations. Concomitant with this change, basal C-peptide and free insulin values increased with glyburide therapy, but this pharmacological agent did not alter the ability of the patient's erythrocytes to bind insulin. We conclude that in type II diabetic subjects receiving more than 28 units of insulin per day, the addition of glyburide results in a marginal, but statistically significant improvement in basal glucose concentration, but not in glucose tolerance as assessed by integrated glucose concentration. Whether this small improvement in glycemia is worth the additional cost of sulfonylureas or the risk of drug side effects is not known.\r"

In this study the complete proviral sequence was shown to be integrated in the genome of these cells. The env-related proteins gp85 and gp37 and the gag-related proteins pr76, pr60, and p19 can be detected in cytoplasmic extracts of ASV-infected human cells. Comparable amounts of pp60v-src were found in human and avian cells infected with ASV. The associated kinase activity in infected human cells was dramatically increased as compared to that of uninfected controls; the enzyme had the same cation and substrate requirements as those from ASV-transformed avian cells. Replicating particles from infected human cells were purified and were significantly modified compared to those from avian hosts as shown by a) higher specific gravity, b) the presence of RSV gag-related but not env-related antigens, and c) the fact that the virus-associated reverse transcriptase preferred the divalent cations Mn2+ and Fe2+ over Mg2+.\r"

  ".W": "The DNA obtained from the leukemia cells of an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, L3 type) with a pre-B-phenotype and a typical t(8;14) chromosomal translocation showed a rearrangement juxtaposing the c-myc gene and the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain gene enhancer. This abnormality was only present in the leukemia cells of the patient and correlated with the clinical course of the disease. The breakpoint on chromosome 8 occurred within c-myc intron 1, between 790 and 638 base pairs upstream of c-myc exon 2. This breakpoint position was the nearest to the c-myc exon 2 so far described in Burkitt's type lymphoma-leukemias, and it mapped very near to the location of a major cryptic promoter used by truncated c-myc genes. In spite of what was detected in a human lymphoma cell line (Manca) carrying a similar rearrangement, in this case the amount of c-myc transcript was not increased compared to an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed normal lymphoblastoid cell line obtained from the same patient. This may in part be due to the breakpoint position and to the fact that the efficiency of the major cryptic promoter present within the first intron could have been affected by the translocation event. Finally, as previously suggested by others, the phenotype expressed by the leukemia cells supported the notion that this particular type of rearrangement (linking together the c-myc gene and the Ig heavy-chain gene enhancer element) may be associated with a subgroup of B-ALLs showing an immunologic phenotype relatively more immature than that of classical B-ALL.\r"

Diminished lymphocyte reactivity has been recently shown in these patients to be linked to deficiencies in interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. In the present study, this observation was expanded by demonstrating that exogenous purified or recombinant IL-2 does not improve the mitogen responsiveness of lymphocytes obtained from these patients. Studies were also conducted to determine the percentage of IL-2-receptor-positive cells at various times after phytohemagglutinin stimulation with the use of anti-TAC monoclonal antibody. The results demonstrated that the number of lymphocytes induced to express receptors for IL-2 was reduced as compared to normal values. These cumulative data therefore suggest that the failure of mitogen to induce blastogenesis in lymphocytes from patients with malignant gliomas results from intrinsic deficiencies in potentially responsive cells, which are expressed in the early phase of the cell cycle.\r"

For assessment of the postinitiation effects of I3C, rainbow trout were exposed to dietary I3C in two different protocols--before and during AFB1 exposure or after AFB1 exposure only. Preinitiation exposure to I3C reduced AFB1-initiated hepatocellular carcinomas in trout as previously reported, but post-initiation I3C exposure strongly enhanced the tumor incidence above the positive AFB1 control. These results reveal the need for additional research to elucidate the overall effect of I3C on chemical carcinogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and kininase activities were measured in various segments of the rabbit nephron. ACE was determined with tritiated hippuryl-glycylglycine as substrate. Lysyl-bradykinin (LBK) hydrolysis (kininase activity) was measured by radioimmunoassay. ACE was only found in the glomerulus and in the two parts of proximal tubule: the convoluted proximal tubule and the pars recta (PR). It was distributed along a concentration gradient which increased from the glomerulus to PR. Kininase activity was found in both proximal and distal parts of the nephron. Besides intense LBK-hydrolyzing activity in the proximal tubule, a kininase activity was also found in the medullary collecting tubule (MCT). Kininase activity in the glomerulus and the proximal tubule was completely inhibited by chelating agents. Captopril inhibited this activity only in the PR and at high concentrations (above 10(-7) M). These results indicate that several types of enzymes other than ACE hydrolyze kinins in the glomerulus and in the proximal tubule. The contribution of ACE to kinin hydrolysis appears only minimal. The kininase activity found in MCT was different from ACE and other proximal tubule kininases because it was not inhibited by chelating agents. This kininase may play a physiological role in inactivating the kinins formed by kallikrein at or beyond the connecting tubule.\r"

LE rats, dehydrated for 72 hours, had an increased plasma osmolality and plasma vasopressin. They also demonstrated a higher atrial immunoreactive ANP (IR-ANP) content than hydrated animals (72 hr dehydration: 178.2 +/- 30.4 micrograms/g wet weight atria, mean +/- SE, control: 60.4 +/- 8.2; P less than 0.001). Plasma IR-ANP in dehydrated LE rats tended to be lower than hydrated LE but this was not statistically significant [72 hr dehydration: 61.9 +/- 5.9 pg/ml, control: 82.4 +/- 8.2]. IR-ANP concentration in atrial extracts from DI rats, without detectable plasma vasopressin levels but with increased plasma osmolality, was not different from that in hydrated LE rats (DI: 100.6 +/- 13.2 micrograms/g). There was also no significant difference between plasma IR-ANP in DI and hydrated LE rats (DI: 100.2 +/- 11.9 pg/ml). The atrial IR-ANP concentration in DI rats was decreased by infusion with either arginine-vasopressin (AVP) or 1-deamino-8-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP), and plasma IR-ANP was increased significantly by both infusions (AVP: 171.3 +/- 18.1 pg/ml, DDAVP: 179.5 +/- 24.6). Thus, changes in atrial and plasma IR-ANP concentration appeared to be associated with changes in water balance but not with plasma AVP levels, indicating that the changes in volume may be a more important factor controlling ANP release in vivo than vasopressin itself.\r"

This material differed from amyloid in that fibrils were thicker (diameter range 10 to 19.5 nm) and did not stain with Congo Red. In six of seven cases fluorescence microscopy showed prominent staining for IgG and kappa light chain in mesangium and glomerular capillary walls; in three cases weak lambda chain staining was also present. Stains for IgA, IgM, and lambda chain were otherwise negative. One biopsy showed equal staining for kappa and lambda light chains, but not for heavy chain components. Clinical findings were heterogeneous. Patients presented with features of nephritis and/or nephrotic syndrome. No patient had an associated lymphoplasmacytic disorder, paraproteinemia, or other evidence of systemic disease. On follow-up ranging from five months to 12 years, all patients are still alive; six progressed to end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. One patient developed recurrent disease in a renal allograft five years after transplantation. Non-amyloidotic fibrillary glomerulonephritis is an ultrastructurally distinct entity of undetermined etiology. The apparent association with monoclonal IgG and kappa light chain deposition observed in this series deserves further study.\r"

The proportion of mastectomy discharges attributed to total mastectomies increased in Sacramento and decreased in Syracuse. Mean stays for mastectomy DRGs declined by 13.72 to 56.38%. In 1984 mean stays ranged from 4.79 to 7.49 days for total mastectomies and 1.88 to 5.44 days for subtotal mastectomies. A major problem identified by the study was the lack of DRG sensitivity to differences in types of procedures.

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that deficiencies in hypothalamic-pituitary function in genetic hemochromatosis result from cellular injury by iron deposits, we conducted provocative tests in 11 men with genetic hemochromatosis before and after iron depletion by serial phlebotomy and in 10 control subjects. We gave combination intravenous injections of insulin (0.15 U/kg), luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH, 100 micrograms), and thyrotropin releasing hormone (400 micrograms) and then measured plasma glucose, growth hormone, corticosteroids, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone at 30-minute intervals for 90 minutes. Phlebotomy caused a substantial decrease in median values for serum ferritin, deferoxamine-chelatable iron, and hepatic iron concentration. Before phlebotomy, stimulation by hypoglycemia and thyrotropin releasing hormone caused significantly less secretion of growth hormone (P = 0.004) and prolactin (P = 0.03) in patients than in control subjects. No significant improvement was noted, however, in growth hormone or prolactin secretion after phlebotomy. Of the 11 patients, 7 had secondary hypogonadism, and phlebotomy did not improve the serum testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or responses to LHRH in any case. Chlorpromazine injections failed to elevate serum prolactin in all patients, and administration of levodopa caused a partial reduction in serum prolactin; thus, the hypothalamus may be an important locus of endocrine malfunction in these patients. We conclude that abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary function in genetic hemochromatosis is not substantially improved by iron-depletion therapy.\r"

Preoperative and postoperative nutritional support, continued until the patient is able to take adequate nutrients by mouth, is an important part of the management of these patients and can improve the care and decrease the likelihood of complications.\r"

  ".W": "The number of genetic disorders detectable antenatally by the use of DNA probes has risen rapidly. The demand for diagnosis and termination of affected pregnancies in high-risk families is likely to increase as tests become more accurate and widely known. Each Regional Health Authority (RHA) must therefore urgently compare any financial savings to be made from a DNA diagnostic service with the cost of setting up and running a laboratory. There are great difficulties in conducting a formal cost-benefit analysis, but the pressing need for a cost appraisal made a more limited cost-savings approach necessary. This paper uses a broad-brush approach for all disorders and known costs for inpatient hospital care only. Despite the limitations of the method, in the two regions studied (North West and South East Thames) there would be clear savings at hospital level if a DNA screening laboratory were set up in each region. Funds released from treatment of genetic disorders could be used for other purposes. There are benefits to the families concerned, social service and educational savings, and other health service savings not considered here. On hospital costs alone there are benefits from the programme and wider consideration will make it more cost-effective. Once a programme is set up, new developments will make it even more cost-effective. It is concluded that RHAs should attach high priority to the setting up of such laboratories.\r"

Our experience, and that reported in the literature, indicates that, in most cases, isolated Bacillus bacteremia is not a particularly serious disease. Therefore, under most circumstances, empiric antibiotic therapy designed specifically for treatment of Bacillus is probably not necessary. Endocarditis can occur, but apparently follows bacteremia only infrequently. When these bacteria cause localized infection such as pneumonia, pan-ophthalmitis, visceral abscess, or musculoskeletal infections, tissue necrosis and profound morbidity are the rule. The frequency of these complications following bacteremia appears to be low but cannot be estimated from our experience or that reported in the literature reviewed. The role of intravascular devices and trauma as predisposing factors is emphasized. Immunocompromised hosts and intravenous drug abusers appear predisposed, but intravascular devices in the former group may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Bacillus infections. Antibiotics which appear especially useful in the treatment of Bacillus infections are clindamycin and vancomycin, to which the vast majority of strains are susceptible in vitro. Beta-lactam antibiotics, including the new cephalosporins and penicillins, are of little value in this setting.\r"

We used Southern blot hybridization techniques to examine the immunoglobulin genes in salivary-gland tissue derived from eight patients with benign lymphoepithelial lesions. Three of these patients had intrasalivary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma complicating the lesions, whereas the lesions in the remaining five were all histologically benign. Ten samples from the eight patients all revealed rearrangement of both the heavy-chain and light-chain immunoglobulin genes. In one of the patients in whom non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involved both the salivary-gland lesion and an ipsilateral lymph node, the rearrangements of the heavy-chain and light-chain immunoglobulin genes detected at the two sites were identical. One other patient had two distinct benign lymphoepithelial lesions removed two years apart. The rearrangements of the heavy-chain as well as the kappa light-chain genes detected in these two lesions were entirely different. These data suggest that B-cell clonal expansion has an integral role in the pathophysiology of the benign lymphoepithelial lesion and may explain the increased incidence of lymphoma noted in association with this disorder.\r"

  ".U": "87201746\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated the effect of chenodeoxycholic acid on cerebrospinal fluid sterol and protein composition in six patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a progressive neurologic disease, and in 11 control subjects. In the cerebrospinal fluid from the controls, the mean (+/- SD) levels of cholesterol and cholestanol were 400 +/- 300 and 4 +/- 7 micrograms per deciliter, respectively. The levels were almost 1.5 and 20 times higher in cerebrospinal fluid from untreated patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Cholestanol levels were also markedly elevated in the plasma of untreated patients, but their plasma cholesterol levels (215 +/- 61 mg per deciliter) were not different from control values. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid reduced cerebrospinal fluid cholesterol by 34 percent and cholestanol threefold. Plasma cholestanol levels also decreased sharply. Normal cerebrospinal fluid contained small quantities of albumin, apolipoproteins, and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. In cerebrospinal fluid from untreated patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, immunoreactive apolipoprotein B or apolipoprotein B fragment was increased about 100-fold and albumin about 3.5-fold; apolipoprotein AI, apolipoprotein D, and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase were 1.5 to 3 times more concentrated. Apolipoprotein AIV and apolipoprotein E concentrations were comparable to those in controls, and apolipoprotein AII was considerably decreased. During treatment, the concentrations of albumin and apolipoproteins AI and B declined. These results suggest that increased cerebrospinal fluid sterols are derived from plasma lipoproteins by means of a defective blood-brain barrier in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid reestablished selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier and normalized the concentrations of sterol and apolipoprotein in the cerebrospinal fluid.\r"

  ".U": "87201887\r", 
  ".W": "The primary action of a family of mitogens including bombesin, bradykinin, vasopressin and alpha-thrombin is to activate the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) by phospholipase C is mediated through coupling of surface receptors to a GTP-binding protein (Gp protein) which, in some cells, is inactivated by the toxin of Bordetella pertussis. It is not known whether this signalling pathway is involved in initiating DNA replication, whereas it has been firmly established that reinitiation of DNA synthesis can be triggered without activation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis by, for example, EGF (epidermal growth factor), FGF (fibroblast growth factor) and insulin/IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor-I), members of a class of mitogens known to activate receptor tyrosine kinases. Taking advantage of the fact that Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts respond to either class of mitogens and that their Gp protein appears to be sensitive to pertussis toxin, we have now analysed the toxin's effect on reinitiation of DNA synthesis and find that it inhibits up to 95% of thrombin-induced mitogenicity without affecting EGF- or FGF-induced DNA synthesis and proliferation. These findings strongly suggest that activation of PtdIns(4,5)P2-phospholipase C has a determinant function in growth control, and confirm the existence of alternative growth factor-signalling pathways independent of polyphosphoinositide breakdown.\r"

  ".W": "The physiological proliferation of T lymphocytes (T cells) requires interaction between the humoral growth factor, interleukin 2 (IL-2) and its cell-surface receptor. Studies of IL-2 binding to the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) on T cells have revealed that there are two distinct species of IL-2R, one with high and one with low affinity. Isolation and characterization of cDNA for the human IL-2R made it possible to deduce the complete primary sequence (251 residues) of the receptor protein. However, expression of IL-2R alone is not sufficient for either growth signal transduction or high-affinity site formation: another lymphocyte-specific molecule called converter seems to be required for the biological activity of IL-2R. We found that the converter did not form a stable complex with IL-2R unless the receptor bound the ligand (the 'affinity conversion' model). To discover which are the functionally important parts of the human IL-2R we have constructed artificial mutant cDNAs encoding the receptor. The mutant receptors produced from them had deletions or substitutions in the cytoplasmic region (13 residues), the transmembrane region (19 residues) or the carboxy-terminal portion of the extracellular region (219 residues). All were active in growth signal transduction, efficient internalization and high-affinity site formation in two mouse T-cell lines, suggesting that the extracellular region of IL-2R and the converter may be responsible for growth signal transduction.\r"

I have studied the tail of bacteriophage lambda, whose length is determined by the length of the 'ruler protein', the product of gene H. The length of the tail can be decreased or increased by deleting the middle part of gene H or by forming a small duplication there, and the length of the tail is proportional to the size of the protein. These results can be regarded as a special case of protein engineering, namely supramolecular protein engineering.\r"

  ".W": "Mature oocytes (unfertilized eggs) are arrested at definite cell-cycle stages which vary from species to species. In frogs and mammals, the oocytes are arrested at the second metaphase of meiosis whereas in echinoderms they are blocked later, at the pronucleus stage. What causes the maturing oocytes to stop at some point in the cell cycle is not entirely clear. In frogs, the metaphase arrest seems to be maintained by a cytostatic factor. In echinoderms, which stop at interphase, no such a factor has so far been found. The fertilization process, beyond the introduction of paternal chromosomes, releases the oocyte from cell-cycle arrest and provides a functional centrosome to replace the endogenous centrosome which is apparently lost during oogenesis in most species. Several lines of evidence suggest that release from cell-cycle arrest is mediated by a Ca2+ burst which is associated with fertilization, and it is known that the functional centrosome provided by the sperm is necessary for mitotic spindle formation and cleavages. We report here that microinjection of purified human centrosomes into mature starfish oocytes is sufficient to release them from arrest at interphase and to support many cleavages leading to the occasional formation of normal embryos. In this species centrosome induced re-entry into the cell cycle does not require a transient calcium burst nor does it require intact microtubules.\r"

  ".U": "87201962\r", 
  ".W": "Many cell-surface receptors for hormones appear to exert their effects on target cells by interacting with specific guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (G-proteins) which couple receptors to their second-messenger signal generation systems. A common intracellular second messenger, which is used by many hormones, is cyclic AMP. This is produced by adenylate cyclase, whose activity is controlled by two G-proteins, Gs which mediates stimulatory effects and Gi inhibitory effects on adenylate cyclase activity. In liver, the hormone glucagon increases intracellular cAMP concentrations by activating adenylate cyclase by a Gs-mediated process. This effect of glucagon is antagonised by the hormone insulin, although the molecular mechanism by which insulin elicits its actions is obscure. However, insulin receptors exhibit a tyrosyl kinase activity and appear to interact with G-proteins, perhaps by causing phosphorylation of them. In type I diabetes, circulating insulin levels are abnormally low, giving rise to gross perturbations of metabolism as well as to a variety of complications such as ionic disturbances, neuropathies of the nervous system, respiratory and cardiovascular aberrations and predisposition to infection. We show here that experimentally-induced type I diabetes leads to the loss of expression of Gi in rat liver. As it has been suggested that Gi may couple receptors to K+-channels as well as mediating the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, aberrations in the control of expression of this key regulatory protein in type I diabetes may be expected to lead to pleiotropic effects.\r"

Recent interest in EDRF has focused on its possible dysfunction in atherosclerosis. In animal models of the disease, endothelium-dependent relaxation is markedly reduced. The continuous exposure of the endothelium in hyperlipidaemia to high concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), a known atherogenic risk factor, may explain this dysfunction. Here, we demonstrate that pathophysiological concentrations of LDL directly inhibit endothelium-dependent relaxation. Chemically modified LDL, in contrast, is inactive, implying that the inhibition is through a receptor-dependent mechanism.\r"

Of the 56 clones we analysed, nine contained sequences homologous to T-cell receptor alpha-chain joining (J alpha) segments. We have characterized one of these clones; it contains one J alpha segment, and the product out of the recombination of a variable region of the alpha-chain gene (V alpha) with a J alpha gene segment. This is the first demonstration of the presence in extrachromosomal DNA of a reciprocal recombination product of any rearranging immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene. The finding verifies that V alpha-J alpha joining can occur by the looping-out and excision of chromosomal DNA.\r"

The viral DNA contains 6,408 nucleotides incorporating 10 genes, and the protein sheath is composed of about 2,700 major coat protein subunits in a shingled helical array, the symmetry of which is defined by a fivefold rotational axis combined with a twofold screw axis of pitch 3.2 nm. The DNA extends throughout the length of the particle but is not base-paired and has a symmetry different from that of the protein helix. How the DNA is packed remains unclear but the number (2.4) of nucleotides packaged per major coat protein subunit is certainly not integral, in contrast with, say, the packaging of RNA in tobacco mosaic virus. The coat protein subunit is 50 amino-acid residues in length and, in the virus particle, adopts a largely alpha-helical conformation, with the long axis of the helix aligned close to the long axis of the filament. This protein is arranged with its negatively charged N-terminal region on the outside of the filament and its positively charged C-terminal region on the inside abutting the DNA. We report here that positive charge on one of the four lysine side chains in the latter region has a direct effect on DNA packaging, because when this charge is absent, elongated particles are produced with lengths that can be correlated with the residual positive charge in the C-terminal region of the coat protein subunit.\r"

Urokinase, a first generation fibrinolytic agent, has been used to liquefy such clots with some success. Therefore, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), a second generation fibrinolytic drug that may be safer and more effective, was studied to evaluate its ability to lyse clot in vitro and its reactivity in the brain and subarachnoid space. t-PA seems to cause partial clot lysis in small dosages (3750 units/70-cc clot) and in a short time (15 minutes). It seems to perfuse through the clot when injected in one place. It does not cause inflammation or bleeding when injected into the rat brain, but indeed seems to promote resorption of blood when the two are injected together. It does not cause aseptic meningitis when injected into the cisterna magna of rabbits. t-PA may prove to be an important adjuvant to the stereotactic aspiration of intracerebral hematomas. It may be particularly helpful in lysing these clots to make possible more gentle aspiration, removing the risk to surrounding brain of strong vacuum.\r"

In the detection of significant lesions, cervicography was more sensitive than a repeat smear, but less so than colposcopy. Forty-two percent of the colposcopically detected lesions would have gone undetected by repeat Papanicolaou smears, compared with 11% by cervicography. However, Papanicolaou smears were more specific than cervicography (55 versus 29%). The cost per case detected using cervicography for triage was equal to that using follow-up Papanicolaou smears, but was a third higher than referring all patients directly to colposcopy. Merely using repeat smears in patients with atypical Papanicolaou smears may result in nondetection of many significant lesions, especially in populations where follow-up is poor.\r"

Tests with low sensitivity are of concern to each practitioner. Of no less concern, however, are the possible social and emotional consequences of a false-positive test in a family-based, rural, or military community. Several centers serving high-prevalence populations have shown that the Gonozyme Enzyme Immunoassay may provide many advantages in the rapid detection of gonococcal infection in these groups. Few studies, however, have evaluated its efficacy in low-prevalence populations. We compared the Gonozyme with Martin-Lewis culture medium in 1490 women considered at risk for infection with N gonorrhoeae at Keesler USAF Medical Center, Mississippi. Fifty-three women had culture-proved infections (3.6% disease prevalence). The sensitivity and specificity of the Gonozyme in this population were 92.4 and 97.2%, respectively. However, the predictive value of a positive test was only 55.1%, mandating culture confirmation. It appears that in a low-prevalence female population, standard culture techniques provide a more efficient and reliable means of detecting N gonorrhoeae than does the Gonozyme Enzyme Immunoassay.\r"

The binding sites for 125I-labeled human follicle-stimulating hormone (125I-hFSH) were identified in the granulosa cells and in the newly formed corpora lutea. The 125I-labeled human luteinizing hormone (125I-hLH) binding to the thecal cells increased during follicular maturation, and a dramatic increase was preferentially observed in the granulosa cells of the large preovulatory follicle. In the corpora lutea, the binding of 125I-hLH increased from the early luteal phase and decreased toward the late luteal phase. The changes in 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in the corpora lutea corresponded to the 125I-hLH binding. Thus, the changes in gonadotropin binding sites in the follicles and corpora lutea during the menstrual cycle may help in some important way to regulate human ovarian function.\r"

The mucin coatings that develop on soft contact lenses may, therefore, play a significant role in the pathogenesis of contact lens-associated Pseudomonas corneal ulceration. We tested the ability of a variety of enzymatic contact lens cleaners and other enzyme solutions to decrease the adherence of Pseudomonas to mucin-coated soft contact lenses. Of the commercially available solutions that were tested, cleaning with Optizyme and Extenzyme significantly reduced the adherence of Pseudomonas to the lenses, whereas cleaning with the Softmate Weekly Cleaning System had no effect. Optizyme and Extenzyme were as effective as a 10% solution of acetylcysteine and more effective than a 0.25% trypsin solution. Neuraminidase at pH 5 was the most effective solution at reducing the adherence of Pseudomonas to the lenses, supporting the finding that sialic acid is a specific receptor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Soft contact lenses should be cleaned frequently with an effective enzymatic cleaner to reduce the likelihood of Pseudomonas adhering to the lens and thereby reduce the incidence of Pseudomonas corneal ulceration in soft contact lens wearers.\r"

We have used the Insight computer for the evaluation and surgical planning of facial fractures of 16 patients with complex injuries. We present five illustrative cases, directly photographed from the computer monitor. Images can also be manipulated in real time by rotating or planar sectioning (functions best appreciated on video). The ability to cybernetically extract the facial skeleton from living subjects provides precise anatomic data previously unobtainable. The images are valuable for an accurate assessment of the relationship between the injured and uninjured sections of the face. We conclude that 3D reconstruction is an important advance in the treatment of facial fractures.\r"

  ".W": "Frontal sinus obliteration is performed for a variety of reasons, including chronic sinus disease, traumatic injuries, mucoceles, and osteomas of the sinus. Once the decision is made to obliterate the sinus, it is paramount that all mucosal remnants be removed and that the material used to fill the irregular expanses of the frontal sinus help prevent recurrence of the disease process. The materials most commonly used for this purpose are fat, muscle, and pericranium. Fat obtained from the abdomen, gluteal area, or lateral thigh is probably the most frequently used substance. The procurement of fat in the traditional way adds significant time to the operation and is associated with significant morbidity at the donor site. Fat obtained in this manner is often bulky and does not truly conform to the sinus contour. In an attempt to minimize operating time and donor-site morbidity--as well as obtain a more malleable graft--we used liposuction to obtain our fat grafts for sinus obliteration. Using this method, we were able to obtain an adequate amount of tissue from either the abdomen or lateral thigh in all patients. We have used this technique in eleven patients, with follow-ups ranging from 3 to 18 months. We have had no donor-site morbidity and (to date) there has been no recurrence of sinus disease in these patients. While the follow-up period is not adequate for final evaluation in these patients, we believe this is a valuable adjunct to frontal sinus surgery.\r"

The laser-resistant tube could not be penetrated by a single laser pulse, regardless of laser energy or gas composition. PVC and RR tubes were readily ignited, the probability of ignition being related to oxygen concentration and laser energy. Nitrous oxide readily supported combustion. We suggest that laser surgery of the larynx can be most safely performed with a laser-resistant endotracheal tube and with gas mixtures containing the minimal safe O2 concentration (without nitrous oxide).\r"

Initially, we demonstrated that it was indeed feasible to electrophysiologically pace abduction of the vocal cords synchronously with respiration, employing the EMG activity of the diaphragm as a trigger stimulus. Further research has led us to evaluate other possible physiologic trigger stimuli to ascertain which of these will prove most suitable in long-term pacing studies. In this article, we will report our preliminary results, employing negative intrathoracic pressure occurring with respiration--as detected by an implanted pressure transducer as a trigger stimulus. This device was interfaced with a muscle stimulator attached to electrodes placed in the cricoarytenoid muscles in five canines whose recurrent laryngeal nerves had been sectioned bilaterally. In all animals, obvious physiologic synchrony of vocal cord abduction and a reduction of negative inspiratory intratracheal pressure was achieved during electrical pacing. This reinforces our initial findings that it is indeed feasible to pace vocal cord abduction in bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis with resultant return of physiologic normality to the glottis. Thus, functional electrical stimulation offers an alternative approach to the difficult problems incurred in the patient with bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. It also demonstrates that physiologic negative intrathoracic pressure activity occurring with inspiration can be a trigger source.\r"

Forty-two patients who were admitted to St. Louis University Hospital between the years of 1978 to 1985 with diagnoses of laryngeal cancer were included. All patients received high-resolution CT scan of the larynx preoperatively and subsequently underwent total or partial laryngectomy. None of these patients received preoperative radiotherapy. The accuracy of the clinical vs. CT staging--as well as the accuracy of the staging by combination of the two modalities--was determined by comparison with the postsurgical pathologic staging. The accuracy was assessed separately for glottic, supraglottic, and transglottic carcinoma. The accuracy of CT staging for glottic carcinoma was 75%. However, clinical evaluation in this group of lesions was very reliable, offering 92.9% accuracy. The accuracy of CT staging increased in the supraglottic and transglottic lesions, to become superior to the clinical staging. With combined information gained by both examinations, the preoperative staging accuracy was 91.4% for supraglottic carcinoma and 87.5% for transglottic carcinoma. It is, therefore, recommended that high-resolution CT should be included in the preoperative staging of laryngeal cancer.\r"

Thin-section CT evaluations of the cochleas of six subjects who have used their cochlear implant devices on a daily basis for 3 or more years demonstrated no evidence of osteoneogenesis of the cochlea in the vicinity of the active electrode. No corrosion of the electrode or insulation material was noted on electron microscopy of an explanted electrode system. Electrical threshold and dynamic range measurements have remained stable or even improved during the period of observation. Performance measures using a variety of audiologic tests and speech-tracking scores have demonstrated stability of performance.\r"

Recent studies suggest that this incidence is declining, resulting in a concomitant relative increase in the proportion of benign nodular conditions. There is also a heightened awareness that secondary thyroid neoplasms may occur in children surviving primary malignant diseases. Records of 38 children treated surgically at Texas Children's Hospital between 1972 and 1984 have been reviewed to determine the incidence of benign vs. malignant pathosis and to study the role of prior irradiation or chemotherapy in the pathogenesis of thyroid disease. Benign conditions were diagnosed in 27 children (71%), with diffuse hyperplasia (10 children, 26%) and follicular adenoma (8 children, 21%) occurring most frequently. Thyroid carcinoma was diagnosed in the remaining 11 children (29%). All of these patients were euthyroid at presentation, none had received multimodal therapy for a prior malignant condition, and only one had a history of head and neck irradiation in infancy for a treatment of a benign condition (a congenital hemangioma). The clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and surgical management of these patients are reviewed and closely parallel those of patients in other recently published series. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the development of thyroid neoplasia following multimodal therapy for primary disease; however, this incidence must be very low.\r"

Recurrence rate in one group of basal cell carcinomas, situated on embryologic fusion lines, was statistically higher than in other groups of basal cell carcinomas situated on other parts of the face and on the capillitium which served as control. Histopathologic subclassification of the recurrent basal cell carcinomas revealed a higher incidence of nodular type with infiltrative margin and of the infiltrative type. Basal cell carcinomas situated in fusion lines tended to grow deeper than in other sites. It was concluded that embryologic fusion lines in the face provide risk zones for spread and recurrence of basal cell carcinomas. Subclassification of basal cell carcinomas should be performed in the routine histopathologic reporting of these neoplasms as a means of predicting recurrence.\r"

MR also provides excellent resolution of certain tumors of the head and neck and is particularly useful for the evaluation of neoplasms in the vicinity of the skull base. The absence of a bone signal prevents the streaking artifact so troublesome with computerized axial tomography (CT) and allows better definition of tumor. MR does not use ionizing radiation and appears to be an innocuous imaging mode--thus multiple examinations in young patients are not objectionable with MR. The ability to obtain images in multiple planes by control of the magnetic gradients allows for axial, sagittal, and coronal imaging, without changing the supine position of the patient. Multiple projections are helpful in providing better preoperative assessment of the extent and size of certain neoplasms of the neck.\r"

A chemical peel produces a mild chemical burn, which is one form of nonbacterial inflammatory response. Some authors advocate the concomitant use of face lift and chemical peel, while others caution that the peel might jeopardize the facial flaps. To determine whether the reaction caused by a chemical peel enhances or impairs skin flap survival, a study using miniature pigs was undertaken. Survival length of flaps treated with a chemical peel was compared to that of untreated flaps. A total of 36 dorsally based random flaps were used on three miniature pigs. Six identical 14 X 4 cm flaps were designed on each side of the pigs. A chemical peel was applied to the area of 18 of the proposed flaps 2 days prior to elevation. Alternate flaps on each side of the pigs were treated. As the flaps were elevated, the tips were examined to document the inflammatory response histologically. After 14 days, the surviving length of the flaps was measured. As determined by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, there was no significant difference between the treated and untreated groups. Our study shows that a nonbacterial inflammatory response produced by a chemical peel does not improve skin flap survival, at least not in pigs.\r"

Subjective ratings of the state of tinnitus (resolution, improvement, maintenance, or deterioration) were obtained by questionnaire. Surgical procedures performed for correction of vertigo frequently alter tinnitus. In general, procedures that conserve hearing--namely, retrolabyrinthine vestibular neurectomy (RVN), middle fossa vestibular neurectomy (MFVN), and endolymphatic shunt procedures (ELS)--have a 50% to 65% chance of helping relieve tinnitus and up to a 22% chance of worsening tinnitus. When there is no serviceable hearing, cochleovestibular neurectomy (CVN) offers the best cure rate for tinnitus (76%) and the least chance of worsening tinnitus (3%). When hearing is minimal and the patient complains of tinnitus, a CVN--rather than a labyrinthectomy--should be recommended. However, when useful hearing is present, a CVN is not usually recommended for relief of tinnitus, since the actual cure rates are only 35%. When vertigo is not a complaint, there is currently no surgical procedure known that can be recommended for the treatment of tinnitus.\r"

Preservation of facial nerve function and total tumor removal is the goal of all acoustic neuroma surgery. The refinement of the translabyrinthine removal of acoustic neuromas by Dr. William House significantly improved preservation of facial nerve function. This is made possible by the anatomic identification of the facial nerve at the lateral end of the internal auditory canal. When the surgery is accomplished from a suboccipital or retrosigmoid approach, the facial nerve may be identified at the brain stem or within the internal auditory canal. Identifying the facial nerve from the posterior approach is not as anatomically precise as from the lateral approach through the labyrinth. The use of a facial nerve stimulator can greatly facilitate identification of the facial nerve in these procedures.\r"

Calvarial bone grafting provides a readily accessible source of bone from an inconspicuous donor site, usually within the same operative field. The morbidity is minimal.

A 6-year retrospective review at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh identified 100 cases of acute epiglottitis, which were initially managed with nasotracheal intubation. Extubation was based on direct laryngeal inspection performed in the operating room (1979-1981) and, more recently, in the intensive care unit (1982-1984). Length of intubation decreased from 63.8 hours in 1979 to 42.1 hours in 1984. The percent of children intubated longer than 48 hours decreased from 69% to 22% in the same time period. These data indicate that a shorter period of intubation is aided by daily laryngeal inspection in the ICU. We propose a staging system for acute epiglottitis to aid in the decision to safely extubate these children.\r"

Clinical reports have indicated mixed results in the efficacy of this treatment modality. Nineteen large dogs received acute subglottic injuries from a high-speed electric drill and electrocautery. All animals developed obstructing lesions from 7 to 21 days after injury. With at least weekly removal of granulation tissue and dilations, all animals developed mature subglottic and/or posterior commissure scars. Two animals required tracheostomy. The 15 animals in the experimental group underwent 16 laser procedures. Three animals had vaporization of one third of the scar, three of one half of the scar, and three had total circumferential vaporization. Five animals underwent microtrapdoor flap procedures. Of these, four had a single flap and one had three separate flaps created. In the remaining animal in the experimental group a glottic web developed, which was totally ablated. In one animal treated with a microtrapdoor flap procedure a posterior sinus tract also developed and was treated with laser ablation. The animals undergoing segmental resection of scar demonstrated no improvement in airway size. Those undergoing total resection experienced a worsening of the condition. Those undergoing microtrapdoor flap repair demonstrated moderate improvement in airway size. It can be concluded that large areas of scar removal in the larynx by the CO2 laser will result in prompt recurrence and possible worsening of the scar and smaller submucosal resection of the scar, with preservation of mucosa by the microtrapdoor flap technique, may be helpful in improving the airway.\r"

We present two cases in which a unique and hitherto unreported pathway of spread of a cholesteatoma is noted. The cholesteatoma, after originating in the ear, entered the diploe and spread insidiously between the inner and outer tables to distal parts of the skull. Osteomyelitis, in concert with the cholesteatoma, destroyed large areas of the skull in both patients. One patient died of his disease. The other patient was operated on and is alive but has unresectable disease and purulent drainage from three separate cranial fistulas.\r"

Eleven of 49 patients with cystic fibrosis (22%) were seropositive compared to none of 19 siblings (P less than 0.05). Six of the 11 patients demonstrated high titers (greater than or equal to 1:512) that persisted throughout the study. Absorption with pools of various Pseudomonas species reduced the antibody titers such that only 3 remained positive after absorption. Legionella was not found to be an important cause of clinical deterioration during this study. The results of the absorption studies suggest that high titers to Legionella in this population are due to cross-reacting antibodies.\r"

Milk prehydrolyzed by in vitro incubation with enzymes was used as the standard of reference, and the degree of incomplete digestion of lactose from 240 mL of milk was determined using the hydrogen breath test. In in vivo dose-response studies, both 3,250 neutral lactose units of Lactaid and 6,635 food and chemical codex lactose units of Takamine completely eliminated excess H2 excretion in a small sample of lactose-maldigesting subjects. When evaluated in a controlled, clinical trial setting, the same dose of Lactaid added directly to the milk at consumption produced an 82% relative reduction in H2 excretion, whereas Takamine was equally as effective as the prehydrolyzed milk. Thus, intraluminal conditions and gastrointestinal transit in the preschool child support the effective assisted digestion of milk lactose in an efficient manner and with the same enzyme to milk ratios as observed previously in adults.\r"

The deduced amino acid sequence contained sequences identical to those in seven tryptic peptides (total 63 amino acids) from bovine brain Go alpha. The cDNA for bovine retinal Go alpha exhibits greater than 90% identity in both coding and 3' untranslated regions with a recently described partial cDNA clone for Go alpha from rat brain [Itoh, H., Kozasa, T., Nagata, S., Nakamura, S., Katada, T., Ui, M., Iwai, S., Ohtsuka, E., Kawasaki, H., Suzuki, K. & Kaziro, Y. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 3776-3780]. Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the bovine Go alpha clone with those previously reported for other G proteins of bovine origin (Gs alpha, Gi alpha, and T alpha) reveals extensive regions identical to those surrounding the amino acids modified by cholera toxin and pertussis toxin. There are also marked similarities of sequence in regions of the G proteins, elongation factors, and the ras p21 gene products that are believed to be involved in guanine nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolysis.\r"

One encoded narrow-spectrum mercurial resistance to Hg2+ and a few organomercurials; the other specified broad-spectrum resistance to phenylmercury and additional organomercurials. Each determinant governed mercurial transport functions. Southern DNA X DNA hybridization experiments using gene-specific probes from the plasmid R100 mer operon indicated close homology with the R100 determinant. The 2153 base pairs of the promoter-distal part of the broad-spectrum Hg2+-resistance operon of pDU1358 were sequenced. This region included the 3'-terminal part of the merA gene, merD, unidentified reading frame URF1, and a part of URF2 homologous to previously sequenced determinants of plasmid R100. Between the merA and merD genes, an open reading frame encoding a 212 amino acid polypeptide was identified as the merB gene that determines the enzyme organomercurial lyase that cleaves the C--Hg bond of phenylmercury.\r"

These results suggest that, during evolution, mitochondrial precursor proteins could arise as a result of DNA rearrangements that place potential mitochondrial presequences at the amino terminus of existing open reading frames. Primitive eukaryotic cells may have used this mechanism to target proteins to their endosymbiotic protomitochondria.\r"

  ".U": "87204100\r", 
  ".W": "We have undertaken studies on bovine liver argininosuccinase (L-argininosuccinate arginine-lyase, EC 4.3.2.1) with the active site-directed reagent bromo[U-14C]mesaconic acid, an analogue of fumaric acid. Reactivity, measured by enzyme inactivation, followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the rate increased with reagent concentration. Argininosuccinate completely protected the enzyme against inactivation, but neither arginine nor fumarate was protective. A plot of the degree of inactivation as a function of alkyl groups incorporated was extrapolated to 4 mol per mol of enzyme, or 1 mol per active site. After large-scale alkylation of the enzyme (and digestion with trypsin), two 14C-labeled tryptic peptides were isolated. These were chemically sequenced by the Edman method. The amino acid sequences proved to be identical with regions of the deduced amino acid sequences or argininosuccinases from human and yeast sources [O'Brien, W. E., McInnes, R., Kalumuck, K. & Adcock, M. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 7211-7215; Beacham, I. R., Schweitzer, B. W., Warrick, H. M. & Carbon, J. (1984) Gene 29, 271-279]. The 14C-labeled tryptic peptide in the active site region had the sequence Gly-Leu-Glu-Xaa-Ala-Gly-Leu-Leu-Thr-Lys; Xaa represents an unknown phenylthiohydantoin derivative detected in cycle 4. The corresponding amino acid was identified as lysine-51 on the basis of sequence similarity with human and yeast amino acid sequences in this region. The reaction of the enzyme with the alkylating agent and the specific protection against inactivation by argininosuccinate suggest that this lysine residue has an essential role in the binding of argininosuccinate to the enzyme and, consequently, is essential for catalysis.\r"

We report experiments describing the isolation, characterization, and immunocytochemical localization of enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme (PBE) of the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation system from normal human liver and compared it with that of rat liver enzyme. The human enzyme, purified approximately equal to 2300-fold by ion-exchange chromatography, is homogeneous as judged by NaDodSO4/PAGE. This PBE is localized exclusively in the matrix of peroxisomes in liver cells by the protein A/gold immunocytochemical method. The human PBE is similar to rat enzyme in size (Mr, approximately equal to 79,000), isoelectric point (pI, 9.8), pH optima, molecular structure as observed by rotary shadowing, and peptide pattern on NaDodSO4/PAGE after proteolytic digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The human and rat enzymes differed in their immunological properties by having partial identity with each other; this is reflected in their slightly dissimilar composition of the amino acids aspartic acid, threonine, glutamic acid, tyrosine, and glycine. COOH-terminal amino acid were similar for both the enzymes: -Gly-Ser-Leu-Ile-COOH. These results suggest that the human and rat liver PBE may be different in their amino acid sequences at their antigenic sites.\r"

In Chinese hamster ovary cells the major GRPs are approximately equal to 76, 97, and 170 kDa. Removal of each of these four GRP-inducing stresses leads to the coordinate repression of GRPs and induction of the major heat shock proteins at 70 and 89 kDa. The application of each of these four GRP-inducing conditions leads to a significant induction of resistance to the drug doxorubicin. Removal of each GRP-inducing condition results in the rapid disappearance of this resistance in a manner that correlates with the repression of the GRPs. The retention of doxorubicin by GRP-induced cells does not explain the induced drug resistance. When the RIF in vitro/in vivo tumor system is probed with an antibody against the 76-kDa GRP, a significant increase in this GRP is observed in cells obtained from the central regions of tumors. Since hypoxia and/or nutrient deprivation can occur during tumor development, a GRP-induced state in the tumor may confer resistance to doxorubicin treatment.\r"

The derived phylogenetic tree indicated a branching sequence, from oldest to most recent, of cercopithecoids (Macaca fascicularis), gibbon-siamang, orangutan, gorilla, and human-chimpanzee. A cladistic analysis of 240 electrophoretic characters that varied between ape species produced an identical tree. Genetic distance measures obtained by 2DE are largely consistent with those generated by other molecular procedures. In addition, the 2DE data set appears to resolve the human-chimpanzee-gorilla trichotomy in favor of a more recent association of chimpanzees and humans.\r"

The results indicate that interferon regulation of class I gene expression is complex and involves at least two mechanisms that are dependent on class I sequences located upstream and downstream to the transcription initiation site. In transfected mouse L cells, both of these regions are required for full enhancement of class I gene expression, with the major portion of the response controlled by the sequences located 3' to the transcription initiation site. The fine-mapping analysis of the 5' region-encoded response also suggests that recombinant alpha and gamma interferons may exert their effects on class I gene expression by using different cis-acting regulatory sequences.\r"

A significant reduction of IFN-gamma protein levels in PBL culture medium was achieved with a physiologic 1,25-(OH)2D3 concentration (0.1 nM). 1,25-(OH)2D3 also inhibited accumulation of IFN-gamma mRNA in activated PBLs in a dose-dependent fashion. The ability of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to modulate IFN-gamma protein synthesis was unaltered in the presence of high concentrations of recombinant human interleukin 2. The suppression of IFN-gamma synthesis by PBLs was specific for 1,25-(OH)2D3; the potencies of other vitamin D3 metabolites were correlated with their affinities for the cellular 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor. The time course of 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor expression in phytohemagglutinin-activated PBLs was correlated with the time course of 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated inhibition of IFN-gamma synthesis. In selected experiments, T-lymphocyte-enriched cell preparations were utilized. In these experiments, 1,25-(OH)2D3 was equally active as in PBL preparations. Finally, we examined the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the constitutive IFN-gamma production by two human T-lymphocyte lines transformed by human T-lymphotropic virus type I. The cell lines were established from a normal donor (cell line S-LB1) and from a patient with vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2 (cell line Ab-VDR). IFN-gamma synthesis by S-LB1 cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by 1,25-(OH)2D3, whereas IFN-gamma synthesis by Ab-VDR cells was not altered by 1,25-(OH)2D3. The data presented in this study provide further evidence for a role of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in immunoregulation.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of H-2-deficient nonmetastatic B16 melanoma cells with physiological doses of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) reduced cellular growth in vitro but induced a shift to the lung-colonizing phenotype as assessed after intravenous injection of the treated cells. As little as 1 antiviral unit of recombinant IFN-gamma per ml induced B16 cells to form 3-40 pulmonary metastases in each injected mouse, whereas a 1000-fold higher concentration of IFN-beta was required to see similar effects. IFN-gamma may induce cell-surface molecules that contribute to the metastatic ability of the tumor cells. The efficient enhancement of metastatic ability after IFN-gamma treatment of the B16 cells was paralleled by an increased H-2 antigen expression and decreased sensitivity to natural killer cells. The experiments support the idea that metastasis may not depend exclusively on stable genetic changes or heterogeneity within a tumor population but may be also influenced through the modulation of the phenotype by physiological or pharmacological agents. The results are also discussed with regard to the role of different effector cells in tumor cell clearance and in relation to lymphokine-based strategies for therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven anti-neurofilament (anti-NF) monoclonal antibodies were studied for their reactivity with heat-stable, microtubule-associated proteins and Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles (ANT). On immunoblots of NF proteins, the antibodies recognized epitopes that were variably sensitive to Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase. Eight of the antibodies showed reactivity with ANT and decreased binding to electroblotted NF after phosphatase treatment. The same eight antibodies reacted with tau proteins from bovine and rat brain, binding to tau proteins was also substantially reduced by phosphatase. Of the eight antibodies that bound to animal tau proteins, five also bound to tau proteins from normal human brain. All of the antibodies that bound to animal tau proteins stained ANT in frozen tissue sections. Brief treatment of tissue sections with trypsin in most cases enhanced antibody binding to ANT. All antibodies that lacked reactivity with tau proteins failed to bind ANT. Phosphatase treatment of Alzheimer tissue sections did not change the immunoreactivity of ANT and neurites in senile plaques with ANT-reactive, anti-NF antibodies, except for two antibodies that showed decreased binding to ANT. In contrast, axonal staining was decreased or eliminated by phosphatase treatment, similar to the response of electroblotted NF and tau proteins. These results suggest that staining of ANT by anti-NF antibodies may be due to cross-reaction of anti-NF with epitopes in tau proteins, the epitopes in axons, NF, and tau are sensitive to the effect of phosphatase, whereas the majority of those in ANT are not, and some of the epitopes in ANT that are shared with NF and tau proteins are not readily accessible to antibody binding.\r"

  ".W": "Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques are the principal pathological features of Alzheimer disease. Neurofibrillary tangles and the neurites of senile plaques contain paired helical filaments (PHF) that consist of two 10-nm filaments twisted into a double helix. The precursor proteins of PHF are not fully known. To identify these precursors, numerous immunochemical studies have been carried out during the past decade. Two apparently conflicting results have been reported. (i) Some, but not all, monoclonal antibodies to neurofilaments stained neurofibrillary tangles. (ii) Polyclonal antibodies prepared to PHF purified in NaDodSO4 because of their unusual insolubility did not recognize normal proteins, including neurofilaments, on electrophoretic transfer blots of human brain homogenates. These results have been confirmed in several laboratories, including by the use of electron microscopic labeling. Recently, we reported that polyclonal PHF antibodies include antibodies to tau proteins, a family of heat-stable microtubule-associated phosphoproteins, and that antibodies to tau stain Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles. Those monoclonal neurofilament antibodies that recognize tangles are reported to be directed against phosphorylated epitopes. These facts prompted us to reexamine certain neurofilament monoclonal antibodies that stain neurofibrillary tangles. All monoclonal neurofilament antibodies that stain tangles that we examined, including those initially reported, reacted with tau proteins. Our results suggest that these antibodies react with phosphorylated tau proteins in PHF, not neurofilament proteins, highlighting the problem of using antibodies to phosphorylated protein epitopes in immunochemical studies. Independent evidence for the presence of neurofilament proteins in human paired helical filaments is now required.\r"

Immunoglobulin constant (C) domains of the mouse monoclonal antibody L6, C gamma 2a and C kappa, were substituted by the human C gamma 1 and C kappa by recombining cDNA modules encoding variable or C domains. The cDNA constructs were transfected into lymphoid cells for antibody production. The chimeric antibody and mouse L6 antibody bound to carcinoma cells with equal affinity and mediated complement-dependent cytolysis. In the presence of human effector cells, the chimeric antibody gave antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity at 100 times lower concentration than that needed for the mouse L6 antibody. The chimeric antibody, but not the mouse L6 antibody, is effective against a melanoma line expressing small amounts of the L6 antigen. The findings point to the usefulness of the chimeric antibody approach for obtaining agents with strong antitumor activity for possible therapeutic use in man.\r"

Relative potencies of cholinergic agonists in stimulating the phosphatidylinositol system, as measured biochemically, parallel their activity in blocking adenosine assessed electrophysiologically. Electrical stimulation of cholinergic afferents also reverses adenosine's inhibitory action. These findings indicate that stimulation of protein kinase C by the phosphatidylinositol system mediates cholinergic blockade of adenosine and baclofen. As these inhibitory agonists act by way of receptors linked to GTP-binding proteins, protein kinase C's inactivation of the GTP-binding protein involved may account for this cholinergic action.\r"

  ".W": "Although Ca2+ is a well-established intracellular messenger, there are many questions concerning the kinetics and spatial localization of its effects. Such problems may now be approached with the photosensitive Ca2+ chelator nitr-5. The Ca2+ affinity of this molecule decreases by a factor of 40 after absorption of near-UV light; Ca2+ is liberated with a time constant of approximately equal to 300 microseconds. Nitr-5 or the related compounds nitr-2 and nitr-7, complexed with Ca2+, were introduced into rat sympathetic ganglion cells by dialysis from a patch pipette electrode operating in the whole-cell, voltage-clamp mode. Light flashes released Ca2+ and activated a K+ current. Flash-induced current relaxations followed a simple exponential time course with time constants as brief as 5 ms. Comparison of the kinetics among the chelators, which photolyze at different rates, suggests that release of Ca2+ from nitr-5 is too fast to limit the relaxation. Thus we confirm directly that Ca2+ can modulate membrane properties within a few milliseconds after entering a cell. A preliminary kinetic description of K+ current activation by Ca2+ in rat sympathetic neurons is presented; Ca2+ appears to bind to the channel with a rate constant of at least 2 X 10(7) M-1 X s-1.\r"

  ".W": "A search for potent toxins that inhibit neuronal calcium channels in Drosophila melanogaster has resulted in the identification of a presynaptic neurotoxin from the venom of the hunting spider Hololena curta. Using Drosophila neuromuscular junction as an assay, presynaptic inhibitory activity was purified using gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC. Data from gel electrophoresis indicate that the toxin is composed of two different subunits of Mr 7000 and 9000. At nanomolar concentrations the toxin produced a complete and long-lasting inhibition of synaptic transmission at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction without affecting the amplitudes of the spontaneously occurring miniature junction potentials. The block of transmission produced by the toxin was observed even during the direct depolarization of the motor nerve terminal. These physiological results indicate that the terminal is the site of action for the toxin. Indirect evidence using abnormally excitable Drosophila mutants suggests that the toxin is inhibiting transmitter release by altering the electrical properties of the nerve terminal rather than by interfering with nonelectrical events that may occur subsequent to calcium influx. All of the actions of the Hololena toxin can be explained by a specific and direct effect on presynaptic calcium channels in Drosophila motor neurons.\r"

Uracil prototrophs resulting from transformation with a multicopy YEp24 yeast genomic library were screened, leading to the identification of transformants possessing high levels of glycosidase activity. Restriction maps of plasmids from multiple isolates were used to localize glycosidase-overproduction genes, which were subcloned into a Schizosaccharomyces pombe/S. cerevisiae shuttle vector. Transformation of Sch. pombe with BGL1 and CTS1 subclones resulted in the appearance of these activities in this organism, and an AMS1 plasmid caused a 2-fold increase in endogenous alpha-mannosidase levels. Insertion of the marker gene LEU2 into putative AMS1 sequences disrupted plasmid-encoded alpha-mannosidase overproduction. S. cerevisiae strains that incorporated a restriction fragment containing ams1::LEU2 into their chromosomal DNA by homologous recombination expressed no detectable alpha-mannosidase activity in either the haploid or homozygous recessive diploid states, whereas heterozygous and wild-type cells exhibited levels proportional to AMS1 gene dosage. No readily apparent phenotype was associated with the alpha-mannosidase deficiency; however, labeling experiments utilizing [2-3H]mannose suggest that alpha-mannosidase may function in mannan turnover.\r"

Thus, the regulation of the genes of secreted proteinases may serve as an interesting model for growth-controlled genes in general. We studied the genes of the secreted proteinases stromelysin and collagenase by using molecularly cloned cDNAs from each proteinase. Stromelysin cDNA was cloned by differential screening of a total cDNA library from rabbit synovial cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which yielded a clone of 1.2 kilobase pairs; collagenase cDNA was obtained by cloning reverse transcripts of anti-collagenase-immunoadsorbed polysomal mRNA, which yielded a clone of 0.8 kilobase pairs. Stromelysin and collagenase mRNA species of 2.2 and 2.4 kilobases, respectively, were detected on hybridization blots of RNA from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated but not untreated rabbit synovial cells. Expression of stromelysin mRNA was also induced in rabbit alveolar macrophages and rabbit brain capillary endothelial cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Stromelysin and collagenase mRNA were both induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and cytochalasin B at a constant ratio of the two gene products; this suggests coordinate regulation. The fact that induction was blocked after inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide implicates an indirect signal transduction pathway that requires new protein synthesis.\r"

Cells cultured under serum-free conditions secreted significant amounts of progesterone and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). The progesterone secretion was enhanced by the addition of human follitropin, lutropin, and chorionic gonadotropin but not by growth hormone. These cells, when challenged to varying concentrations of human growth hormone, human chorionic somatomammotropin, human prolactin, chorionic gonadotropin, follitropin, and lutropin, secreted IGF-II into the medium as measured by specific IGF-II RIA. Among these human hormones, chorionic gonadotropin, follitropin, and lutropin were most effective in inducing IGF-II secretion from these cells. When synthetic lutropin-releasing hormone and alpha-inhibin-92 were tested, only lutropin-releasing hormone was effective in releasing IGF-II. The results described suggest that cultured human granulosa cells can proliferate and actively secrete progesterone and IGF-II into the medium. IGF-II production in human granulosa cells was influenced by a multi-hormonal complex including human growth hormone, human chorionic somatomammotropin, and prolactin.\r"

  ".W": "Myristoyl CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) catalyzes the addition of myristic acid to the amino-terminal glycine residues of a number of eukaryotic proteins. Recently, we developed a cell-free system for analyzing NMT activity and have begun to characterize the substrate specificity of this enzyme by using a series of synthetic peptides. We have now purified NMT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to apparent homogeneity. The native enzyme is a 55-kDa protein, exhibits no requirement for divalent cation, and appears to contain a histidine residue critical for enzyme activity. A total of 42 synthetic peptides have been used to define structure/activity relationships in NMT substrates. An amino-terminal glycine is required for acylation; substitution with glycine analogues produces peptides that are inactive as substrates or inhibitors of NMT. A broad spectrum of amino acids is permitted at positions 3 and 4, while strict amino acid requirements are exhibited at position 5. Replacement of Ala5 in the peptide Gly-Asn-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-Arg-Arg with Asp ablates the peptide's myristoyl-accepting activity. A serine at this position results in a decrease by a factor of approximately equal to 500 in the apparent Km in the context of three different sequences. Penta- and hexa-peptides are substrates, but with decreased affinity. These studies establish that structural information important for NMT-ligand interaction exists beyond the first two amino acids in peptide substrates and that the side chains of residue 5 play a critical role in the binding of substrates to this enzyme.\r"

These products are confirmed as the gamma and tau subunits of DNA polymerase III because antibody to a synthetic peptide present in both the DnaZ and DnaX proteins reacts also with the gamma and tau subunits of holoenzyme. To characterize biochemically the tau subunit, for which there has been no activity assay, the dnaZX gene was fused to the beta-galactosidase gene to encode a fusion product in which the 20 C-terminal amino acids of the DnaX protein (tau) were replaced by beta-galactosidase lacking only 7 N-terminal amino acids. The 185-kDa fusion protein, which retained beta-galactosidase activity, was overproduced to the level of about 5% of the soluble cellular protein by placing the gene fusion under control of the tac promoter and Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The fusion protein was isolated in one step by affinity chromatography on p-aminobenzyl 1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside-agarose. The purified fusion protein also had ATPase (and dATPase) activity that was dependent on single-stranded DNA. This activity copurified with the beta-galactosidase activity not only through the affinity column but also through a subsequent gel filtration. We conclude that the DnaX protein function involves binding to single-stranded DNA and hydrolysis of ATP or dATP, in addition to binding to other DNA polymerase III holoenzyme components, increasing the processivity of the core enzyme, and serving as a substrate for the production of the gamma subunit.\r"

  ".W": "Crude extracts of a multiply peptidase-deficient strain of Salmonella typhimurium contain an aminopeptidase that specifically removes N-terminal methionine from peptides. This activity shows pronounced specificity for the peptide's second amino acid. Methionine is removed from peptides with alanine, threonine, or glycine in this position but not when the second amino acid is leucine or methionine. The activity is stimulated by Co2+ and is inhibited by EDTA. Mutations that lead to overproduction (up to 30-fold) of the activity have been obtained by selecting for growth on Met-Gly-Gly as a methionine source. These mutations map at approximately 3 map units, phage P22 cotransducible with leu. The overproducer mutations are dominant to wild type, and duplication of the wild-type allele of the locus leads to a gene dosage effect on peptidase levels. This suggests that the locus of the overproducer mutations may be the structural gene for the peptidase. NaDodSO4/PAGE shows an increased level of a single protein (34 kDa) in the overproducer mutant. This protein is highly enriched in a purified preparation of the peptidase. The specificity of this enzyme suggests that it is involved in the cleavage of methionine from newly synthesized peptide chains. This activity can specifically remove methionine from the N terminus of a completed protein. Treatment of purified, unprocessed (N-terminal methionine) interleukin 1 beta with the purified peptidase results in removal of N-terminal methionine with no additional alterations. N-terminal processing of at least this protein can occur after translation is complete. We propose to call this enzyme peptidase M (methionine-specific aminopeptidase).\r"

An antibody to the microtubule translocator kinesin stains the spindles in MCSs and in MCSs treated with 5 mM ATP and also stains spindle-remnants of the MCSs after the microtubules have been extracted. We conclude that kinesin binds to a nonmicrotubule component in the mitotic spindle. Based on these results, we present several models of kinesin function in the spindle.\r"

Based on DNA sequence analysis of homologous sequences from three different cytogenetic regions, the 372-base-pair repeat unit appears to be (A + T)-rich and noncoding and shows strong sequence conservation among units from different chromosomal regions.

We have previously demonstrated that T6 antigens are internalized in Langerhans cells and indeterminate cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. This process is induced by the binding of BL6, a monoclonal antibody directed against T6 antigens. In the present study, using a monoclonal antibody directed against HLA-DR antigens, on human epidermal cells in suspension, we show that the surface HLA-DR antigens are also internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis in Langerhans and indeterminate cells. Moreover, using immunogold double labeling, we demonstrate that T6 and HLA-DR antigens are internalized through common coated regions of the membrane of Langerhans or indeterminate cells. The receptor-mediated endocytosis that is induced involves coated pits and vesicles, receptosomes, lysosomes, and also, in Langerhans cells, the Birbeck granules. Thus, T6 antigens, which are considered to be \"unusual\" or \"nonclassical\" major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, and the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, HLA-DR, are internalized in Langerhans and indeterminate cells through common receptor-mediated endocytosis organelles.\r"

Mouse cells transformed with a truncated human cDNA encoding a mature IFN-gamma protein lacking the signal peptide accumulate high levels of intracellular human IFN-gamma. Not only do these cells acquire a permanent resistance to viral infection, they also exhibit all the biochemical characteristics normally observed after exposure to exogenous IFN. The observed loss of species specificity normally associated with IFN-gamma suggests that this restriction is strictly dependent on the interaction of the molecule with the cell-surface receptor.\r"

This antibody, prepared against the rheumatoid factor (RF) paraprotein Sie, recognizes a crossreactive idiotype on 48% of human IgM RF paraproteins, but does not react with IgM paraproteins without RF activity or substantially with normal pooled immunoglobulin. The 17.109-reactive idiotype is a marker for a kappa III variable-region gene, designated V kappa RF, that is conserved in outbred human populations. In a limited study of 31 CLL patients, the leukemic cells from 5 of 20 patients with kappa light chain-expressing CLL were recognized by the 17.109 monoclonal antibody. Despite having malignant cells specifically reactive with this antibody, patients with 17.109-positive CLL did not have elevated serum levels of circulating antibody bearing 17.109-reactive determinants. Total RNAs isolated from the CLL B lymphocytes, or from hybridomas produced by fusing the CLL cells with the WI-L2-729-HF2 cell line, were fractionated electrophoretically and examined by blot hybridization. Under stringent hybridization conditions capable of discerning a single base-pair mismatch, RNA from the 17.109-idiotype-positive CLL cells hybridized to synthetic oligonucleotide probes corresponding to framework and complementary-determining regions in the V kappa RF gene. The high frequency of the 17.109-associated idiotype and the V kappa RF gene in CLL suggests that the disease may arise from B lymphocytes that express a restricted set of inherited immunoglobulin variable-region genes with little or no somatic mutation.\r"

The contributions of different allelically variable regions of Ia molecules to both of these processes were analyzed by transfection of L cells with various A beta and A alpha gene pairs. The results show that, with regard to quantitative and qualitative aspects of Ia expression, the polymorphisms in the A beta chain segregate into two groups. Those in the NH2-terminal half of A beta 1 have a consistent role in controlling beta-alpha chain interactions, efficiency of dimer expression, and Ia conformation and probably are in the interior of the Ia molecule at the site of beta-alpha domain interaction. Polymorphisms in the COOH-terminal half of A beta 1 contribute to those structures that directly interact with antibodies, antigen, and/or T-cell receptors, consistent with their presence on the surface of the Ia heterodimer. This analysis provides a model for understanding both overall class II molecular structure and the relationship between this structure and immune recognition. It also suggests an explanation for the evolution of certain features of class II genes.\r"

We have previously reported that a somatic mutant of the S107 cell line produces an antibody that has lost the ability to bind P-Cho and has acquired binding for double-stranded DNA. This antibody has a substitution of an alanine for a glutamic acid at residue 35 in the heavy chain variable region. We now show that this amino acid substitution is due to a single A-C transversion, which is the only nucleotide change in the heavy and light chain variable regions. Further, it appears that this change is due to somatic mutation rather than to gene conversion.\r"

  ".W": "The biological response modifier r(I)n.r(C12-U)n, referred to here as mismatched double-stranded (ds) RNA, was examined for antihuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity in vitro because of its known antiviral activity and ability to induce interferon (IFN) in other biological systems [Carter, W. A., Strayer, D. R., Hubbell, H. R. & Brodsky, I. (1985) J. Biol. Response Modif. 4, 495-502]. We found that cultures of the highly HIV-permissive T-cell line C3 were afforded significant protection from HIV infection when incubated in growth media supplemented with mismatched dsRNA at 10-50 micrograms/ml prior to virus challenge. Similar results were obtained at 50 micrograms of mismatched dsRNA per ml in cultures of the T-lymphoblastoid cell line CEM. Infections were monitored by indirect immunofluorescence of cells for viral p24 antigen expression, reverse transcriptase activity in culture fluids for virus production, and vital dye uptake for cytopathic effect. Antiviral activity was increased by the continued presence of mismatched dsRNA in cultures following virus challenge. A one-time exposure to mismatched dsRNA (50 micrograms/ml) provided greater antiviral activity than either a one-time exposure to recombinant IFN-alpha [250 international units (IU)/ml], IFN-beta (250 IU/ml), or IFN-gamma (50 IU/ml) in cultures of CEM cells, or a one-time exposure to a combination of all three IFNs (150 IU each per ml) in cultures of C3 cells. Mismatched dsRNA at 50 micrograms/ml had no effect on cell division, RNA and protein synthesis, or virus replication in all T-cell lines examined. A clear distinction between the activities of mismatched dsRNA and IFN was the ability of IFN to suppress the in vitro replication of HIV that occurred at IFN concentrations (150 IU each of alpha, beta, and gamma per ml) that provided less antiviral activity than mismatched dsRNA (50 micrograms/ml). The results of these in vitro studies suggest a potential therapeutic value for mismatched dsRNA in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\r"

The in vitro assembly of coated pits on these membranes satisfactorily mimics many features of coated pit formation in the intact cell. These studies indicate that: the membranes contain a limited number of coated pit assembly sites that bind clathrin with high affinity; the half-time for assembly is 5 minutes both at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C; during assembly, proteins with molecular sizes of 180, 110, and 36 kilodaltons are recruited to the plasma membrane; and assembly is not dependent on adenosine triphosphate, but this nucleotide triggers a temperature-dependent loss of coated pits that are assembled in the absence of adenosine triphosphate.\r"

When [3H]arachidonate labeling of phospholipids was used as an indicator of phospholipase C activation, transient increases in [3H]diacylglycerol were observed between 0.5 and 10 minutes after the onset of insulin treatment. With [3H]glycerol labeling as an indicator of de novo phospholipid synthesis, [3H]diacylglycerol was increased maximally at 1 minute and remained elevated for 20 minutes. [3H]Glycerol-labeled diacylglycerol was largely derived directly from phosphatidic acid. Insulin increased de novo phosphatidic acid synthesis within 5 to 10 seconds; within 1 minute, this synthesis was 60 times greater than that of controls. Thus, the initial increase in diacylglycerol is due to both increased hydrolysis of phospholipids and a burst of de novo phosphatidic acid synthesis. After 5 to 10 minutes, de novo phosphatidic acid synthesis continues as a major source of diacylglycerol. Both phospholipid effects of insulin seem important for generating diacylglycerol and other phospholipid-derived intracellular signaling substances.\r"

The predicted molecular size is 24 kilodaltons, although its migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gels is anomalously retarded. Expression of GAP-43 is limited to the nervous system, where its levels are highest during periods of neurite outgrowth. Nerve growth factor or adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate induction of neurites from PC12 cells is accompanied by increased GAP-43 expression. GAP-43 RNA is easily detectable, although at diminished levels, in the adult rat nervous system. This regulation of GAP-43 is concordant with a role in growth-related processes of the neuron, processes that may continue in the mature animal.\r"

Stable transfection of the Chinese hamster ovary cell line with the atrial receptor complementary DNA leads to the binding of muscarinic antagonists in these cells with affinities characteristic of the M2 receptor subtype. The atrial muscarinic receptor is encoded by a unique gene consisting of a single coding exon and multiple, alternatively spliced 5' noncoding regions. The atrial receptor is distinct from the cerebral muscarinic receptor gene product, sharing only 38% overall amino acid homology and possessing a completely nonhomologous large cytoplasmic domain, suggesting a role for the latter region in differential effector coupling.\r"

This requirement for RNA in the encapsidation of viral DNA provides a new dimension of complexity to the attendant protein-DNA interactions. The RNA is a constituent of the viral precursor shell of the DNA-packaging machine but is not a component of the mature virion. Studies of the sequential interactions involving this RNA molecule are likely to provide new insight into the structural and possible catalytic roles of small RNA molecules. The phi 29 assembly in extracts and phi 29 DNA packaging in the defined in vitro system were strongly inhibited by treatment with the ribonucleases A or T1. However, phage assembly occurred normally in the presence of ribonuclease A that had been treated with a ribonuclease inhibitor. An RNA of approximately 120 nucleotides co-purified with the phi 29 precursor protein shell (prohead), and this particle was the target of ribonuclease action. Removal of RNA from the prohead by ribonuclease rendered it inactive for DNA packaging. By RNA-DNA hybridization analysis, the RNA was shown to originate from a viral DNA segment very near the left end of the genome, the end packaged first during in vitro assembly.\r"

  ".W": "beta-lactamases are enzymes that protect bacteria from the lethal effects of beta-lactam antibiotics, and are therefore of considerable clinical importance. The crystal structure of beta-lactamase from the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus PC1 has been determined at 2.5 angstrom resolution. It reveals a molecule of novel topology, made up of two closely associated domains. The active site is located at the interface between the domains, with the key catalytic residue Ser70 at the amino terminus of a buried helix. Examination of the disposition of the functionally important residues within the active site depression leads to a model for the binding of a substrate and a functional analogy to the serine proteases. The unusual topology of the secondary structure units is relevant to questions concerning the evolutionary relation to the beta-lactam target enzymes of the bacterial cell wall.\r"

  ".U": "87206193\r", 
  ".W": "Antibody-producing cells display a special form of regulation whereby each cell produces immunoglobulin from only one of its two sets of antibody genes. This phenomenon, called allelic exclusion, is thought to be mediated by the product of one heavy chain allele restricting the expression of the other. Heavy chains are synthesized in two molecular forms, secreted and membrane bound. In order to determine whether it is specifically the membrane-bound form of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) heavy chain (mu) that mediates this regulation, transgenic mice were created that carry a human mu chain gene altered so that it can only direct the synthesis of the membrane-bound protein. The membrane-bound form of the human mu chain was made by most of the B cells in these animals as measured by assays of messenger RNA and surface immunoglobulins. Further, the many B cells that express the human gene do not express endogenous mouse IgM, and the few B cells that express endogenous mouse mu do not express the transgene. Thus, the membrane-bound form of the mu chain is sufficient to mediate allelic exclusion. In addition, the molecular structures recognized for this purpose are conserved between human and mouse systems.\r"

They are often secreted by distinct T cell clones. It is now shown that IFN-gamma stimulates the expression of immunoglobulin (Ig) of the IgG2a isotype and inhibits the production of IgG3, IgG1, IgG2b, and IgE. By contrast, BSF-1 has powerful effects in promoting switching to the expression of IgG1 and IgE but markedly inhibits IgM, IgG3, IgG2a, and IgG2b. These results indicate that BSF-1 and IFN-gamma as well as the T cells that produce them may act as reciprocal regulatory agents in the determination of Ig isotype responses. The effects of IFN-gamma and BSF-1 on isotype expression are independent.\r"

  ".U": "87206216\r", 
  ".W": "To explore the potential use of retrovirus vectors for the transfer of genomic DNA sequences into mammalian cells, recombinant retroviral genomes were constructed that encode a functionally rearranged murine lambda 1 immunoglobulin gene. Several of these genomes could be transmitted intact to recipient cells by viral infection, although successful transmission depended both on the orientation of the lambda 1 sequences and on their specific placement within vector sequences. The lambda 1 gene transduced by viral infection was expressed in a cell lineage-specific manner, albeit at lower levels than endogenous lambda 1 gene expression in cells from the B-lymphocyte lineage. Vectors yielding integrated proviruses that lacked viral transcriptional enhancer sequences were used to show that neither viral transcription nor the viral transcriptional sequences themselves had any effect on the tissue specificity of lambda 1 gene expression or the absolute amount of lambda 1 transcription. Vector transcription did, however, dramatically decrease the amount of lambda 1 protein that could be detected in tranduced cells. These results suggest that retrovirus vectors may be useful reagents not only for the expression of complementary DNA sequences but also for studies of tissue-specific transcription in mammalian cells.\r"

Two kinds of malformations stand out as most typical--hypoplasia of the optic nervehead (up to 48%) and increased tortuosity of the retinal vessels, especially of the arteries (up to 49%). Visual acuity is often moderately or severely reduced.

Ten dogs received no other therapy (controls) and 11 received orally administered cyclosporine from the day before to 30 days after transplantation. Therapeutic blood levels of cyclosporine were documented by means of high-pressure liquid chromatography. There was no difference in engraftment in six of 10 controls, and eight of 11 cyclosporine-treated dogs remained normoglycemic for more than 30 days. Intravenous glucose tolerance test results (K values), fasting serum insulin levels, and insulin secretion in response to a glucose challenge were similar in the two groups. There were two late treatment failures in the control group and one in the cyclosporine-treated group. We were unable to detect an adverse effect of cyclosporine on the engraftment or function of canine islet autografts. We conclude that cyclosporine remains a promising drug for use in studies of islet transplantation in human beings.\r"

The vascular patterns were highly variable and frequently differed from classic descriptions found in textbooks of anatomy. Normal variations that could be easily confused with arterial obstruction were unilateral origin of all cavernosal branches, unilateral hypoplasia of a dorsal penile artery, and aberrant origin of bulbar or cavernosal arteries. Multiple potential collateral routes were shown, including transverse collaterals at the root of the penis and communications between cavernosal and dorsal penile arteries. Appreciation of the type and frequency of anatomic variants and potential collateral routes is important in correctly interpreting penile angiograms and in evaluating the hemodynamic significance of suspected stenoses.\r"

However, the proarrhythmic potential of flecainide deserves further evaluation. In 7 (13%) of 55 consecutive patients treated with oral flecainide, 200 to 600 mg/day, for complex ventricular arrhythmias (including sustained ventricular tachycardia in 14), we observed the appearance of new or more sustained exercise-induced (five patients) or spontaneous (two patients) wide complex tachycardia. The mechanism of wide complex tachycardia appeared to be ventricular tachycardia in all seven. In our series, episodes were self-remitting or successfully treated. In four patients, wide complex tachycardia did not recur during exercise testing during alternative antiarrhythmic therapy (three patients) or no antiarrhythmic therapy (one patient). These observations raise the possibility of flecainide-related proarrhythmia, manifested as an increased propensity to exercise (activity)-induced wide complex tachycardia, which was not reliably predicted by results of Holter recordings or programmed electrical stimulation. Patients with complex ventricular arrhythmias beginning long-term treatment with oral flecainide should be considered for treadmill exercise testing together with ambulatory monitoring as part of the initial assessment of drug efficacy.\r"

Plasma ANP levels were significantly higher in hypertensive subjects compared to borderline hypertensive subjects (p less than 0.05) and normotensive control subjects (p less than 0.05). Hypertensive subjects with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) had higher plasma ANP levels than the hypertensive group as a whole (p less than 0.05). A significant positive correlation was observed between mean blood pressure and plasma ANP level in the hypertensive group (n = 43, gamma = 0.77, p less than 0.01). Furthermore, plasma ANP level was decreased significantly after 4 weeks of effective antihypertensive therapy compared with the initial value (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that plasma ANP is frequently elevated in hypertensive subjects with markedly high blood pressure or LVH, and it can be reduced by effective therapy with antihypertensive drugs.\r"

No deaths from proarrhythmia during flecainide therapy occurred in patients without structural heart disease. Serious proarrhythmic events and deaths were more common in patients in whom therapy was initiated in hospital than in those in whom therapy was initiated out of hospital.

  ".W": "The long-term effect of medical vs surgical therapy on quality of life was evaluated by New York Heart Association functional classification, severity of angina and exercise performance in 427 surviving patients with stable angina at 10 years. Surgically assigned patients had significantly more improvement in functional classification, relief of angina and exercise performance at 1 and 5 years than medically assigned patients. Relative to entry, functional classification was improved in 65% of surgically treated patients at 1 year and in 51% at 5 years, compared with 45% and 40%, respectively, of medically treated patients. Marked improvement in angina was observed in 49% of surgical patients at 1 year and in 41% at 5 years, vs 12% and 17%, respectively, in medical patients. At 10 years, quality of life was not significantly different in the 2 treatment groups: 52% of surgical patients had an improved functional classification, compared with 46% of medical patients, while 33% of surgical and 37% of medical patients had a marked improvement in angina. Exclusion of medical and surgical nonadherers had little effect on the 1- and 5-year comparisons. The 10-year treatment differences, however, were accentuated when 123 medically assigned patients who later underwent operation and who benefited from it were excluded from the analysis. In surgical patients, a strong association was observed between graft patency and functional class at 1 year, but not at 5 and 10 years. In general, patients with some or all grafts open had more improvement in functional classification than patients with all grafts closed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Neither length of stay nor charges differed among AMI patients with or without cardiovascular complications as defined by Medicare's diagnosis-related group (DRG) categories (DRG 121 and 122, respectively) for patients who are discharged alive. Myocardial enzyme peak levels are the best predictors of hospital resource consumption for patients with AMI when considered alone or in combination with other factors. The \"cardiovascular complications\" designated by discharge diagnoses did not reflect resource consumption in our patient population. Sixteen percent of the patients studied underwent cardiac catheterization during hospitalization. These patients stayed in the hospital longer and incurred 70% higher charges; nevertheless, they were grouped with the remaining AMI patients in the current DRG formulation. Clinical evaluations such as cardiovascular complications are subject to interpretation, and are therefore less credible than enzyme measurements for recognizing the severity of a patient's AMI. Reimbursement based on objective measurements may avoid payment inequities.\r"

This study group was compared with a patient control group of 18 AMI patients with 1-vessel obstructive coronary artery disease. Patients were matched for sex, age and AMI date. A healthy control group consisted of 18 sex- and age-matched volunteers. Blood coagulation measurements and platelet reactivity were similar in the 3 groups, except for fibrinogen, which was significantly higher in the patient control group. Plasma activity of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was detectable in only 2 patients in the study group, 9 in the patient control group (p less than 0.02) and 12 in the healthy control group (p less than 0.0001). Median plasma tPA inhibitory activity was higher in the study group (10.3 IU/ml) and the patient control group (8.1 IU/ml) than in the healthy control group (2.7 IU/ml, p less than 0.0001 and p less than 0.03). Thus, reduced activity and enhanced inhibition of plasma tPA may be important factors in the origin of coronary thrombosis, especially in the absence of coronary artery disease.\r"

The emulsions were part of a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) regimen that included 10% dextrose and 5.5% amino acids. Basic nutritional parameters as well as elimination kinetics were monitored. Plasma linoleic acid, ketone, lactate, pyruvate, insulin, glucose, and carnitine were analyzed. The 75% LCT-25% MCT emulsion offers little advantage over 100% LCT as a metabolic substrate. The 50% LCT-50% MCT combination proved to be a potentially better caloric source due to rapid elimination kinetics, increased ketone production, lack of deposition, and no interference with linoleic acid metabolism.\r"

Mixture of his plasma or IgG fraction with washed control platelets resulted in the inhibition of aggregation with ristocetin, but mixture of control plasma or IgG fraction with washed patient platelets showed no inhibition of ristocetin-induced aggregation. Although his vWF: Ag, RCo, and factor VIII coagulant activity were all normal, inactivation of RCo was induced in normal plasma by incubation with patient plasma. Crossed immunoelectrophoretic analysis showed that vWF:Ag was composed of much more anodic component. A marked increase of Factor VIII and a rapid return of RCo to the baseline after 1-deamino-8-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) infusion were observed. A transient increase in vWF:Ag after the infusion of DDAVP showed with less anodic forms and in the relative proportion as in normal. Treatment of the underlying disease also led to a correction of the bleeding time, improvement of platelet adhesion and ristocetin-induced aggregation, and normalization of crossed immunoelectrophoresis of vWF:Ag. The present study showed that myeloma-associated IgG interacted specifically with the antigenic sites on the von Willebrand portion of the Factor VIII complex.\r"

Renal biopsy demonstrated diffuse or focal proliferative glomerular lesions in 48 of 66 patients. The overall incidence of live births was 162 in 213 (76%). Fetal death rate, corrected for induced abortions, was markedly higher when SLE first manifested during or immediately after the index gestation (five of 11, or 45%) than in pregnancies that began prior to clinical onset of SLE (16 of 140, or 11.4%) and in those occurring after onset of SLE (five of 38, or 13.1%). Relapse or an exacerbation of SLE activity occurred in 18 (34%) of 53 pregnancies (in 35 women) which took place after the clinical onset of the disease. Such complications were more frequent (16 of 26 cases, or 61%) in pregnancies in which SLE was clinically active at conception as compared with gestations in which SLE was in clinical remission prior to conception (two of 27 cases, or 7%). There were six instances of severe renal \"flare-up,\" four of which progressed to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) within a few years, including one instance in a patient who was in remission before conception. We conclude that successful outcome of pregnancy without deterioration of maternal renal function may most often be obtained even in previously severe forms of SLE, provided gestation is started in a period of sustained therapeutic remission.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs) have previously been located 5' and 3' to the Apo-A1 gene and in the Apo-CIII gene and were detected after digestion with XmnI, PstI, and SstI, respectively, and hybridization with a 2.2-kb fragment of the Apo-A1 gene. These RFLPs are in linkage equilibrium. The rare variant sites for XmnI (X2) and SstI (S2) were more frequent in familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) than in controls and persons with other genetic hyperlipidemias. When considered as a haplotype, this difference was significant (P less than .03). The findings in this study suggest that the previously reported association between S2 and hypertriglyceridemia may be accounted for, in part, by inclusion of numerous patients with FCH. Our data provide further evidence that these RFLPs around and within the Apo-A1/Apo-CIII genes do not participate in unmasking clinical expression in persons with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.\r"

Almost all compounds tested (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, difloxacin, CI-934, A-56620, and megalone) inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis at achievable serum concentrations, with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin most active by weight (minimal inhibitory concentration at which growth of 90 percent of strains is inhibited is equal to 1 microgram/ml or less). The growth of Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium xenopi, and Mycobacterium fortuitum is also well inhibited by these agents in the same range of concentrations. Activity against the Mycobacterium avium complex is method-dependent, with growth of perhaps one third of the strains isolated from patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome inhibited by ciprofloxacin. Determination of individual drug efficacy data in experimental mycobacterial infections is not a practical goal. However, combination therapy studies are in progress using murine models of both M. tuberculosis and M. avium challenges. Ofloxacin has been used with some success in human patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Oral administration may be an important advantage, and, when used in combination with other active agents, the new quinolones may have a useful role in treating mycobacterial infections.\r"

The results showed agreement between broth and agar methods of susceptibility determination; inoculum effects with beta-lactam antimicrobials; and decreased susceptibility to amikacin under anaerobiasis. Ciprofloxacin combined with azlocillin, ceftizoxime, or aminoglycosides in broth microdilution checkerboards against 100 gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci demonstrated that ciprofloxacin combined with azlocillin or ceftizoxime was synergistic against at least 50 percent of P. aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens isolates and that ciprofloxacin combined with amikacin was synergistic against at least 50 percent of S. marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Ciprofloxacin and azlocillin in combination were evaluated by microdilution checkerboard, agar dilution, and broth macrodilution time-kill methods at two inoculum sizes to assess antibacterial activity. Comparison between in vitro combination methods showed the following: the presence or absence of checkerboard synergism (as defined by the fractional inhibitory concentration index and the fractional bactericidal concentration index) with ciprofloxacin and azlocillin did not correlate with time-kill results; and good agreement between methods when comparing broth macrodilution time-kill (3 log10 cfu/ml or more decrease) with antimicrobial combinations at a single concentration in both agar and microdilution broth for ciprofloxacin and azlocillin. Rabbit studies using subcutaneous dialysis membrane chambers inoculated with six P. aeruginosa, six Enterobacteriaceae, and six group D streptococcal strains were performed using ciprofloxacin, azlocillin, ceftizoxime, and amikacin alone and in combination as therapy. In vitro testing of antibiotic combinations that provided the best prediction of in vivo outcome were combination antibacterial activity (3 log10 cfu/ml or more decrease) at 24 hours using either broth macrodilution time-kill or antimicrobial combinations at a single concentration in either agar or broth (microdilution). For the most efficacious in vivo combination, ciprofloxacin plus azlocillin, there was in vitro correlation with in vivo outcome for 17 of 18 isolates.\r"

  ".W": "The granuloma pouch model in mice infected with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used to investigate the bactericidal effect of ciprofloxacin in vivo on bacteria in the stationary growth phase. Ciprofloxacin caused a rapid decline in the number of colony-forming units (cfu) of E. coli shortly after initiation of therapy (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Ciprofloxacin was more effective than norfloxacin or pefloxacin and comparable in efficacy to ofloxacin. The drugs penetrated well into the pouch exudate, exceeding the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the infecting organisms. The concentrations of pefloxacin or ofloxacin were higher than those of norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Ciprofloxacin also showed good killing effects in pouches infected with one strain of P. aeruginosa (ICB 7453, MIC of 0.06 micrograms/ml). However, with another P. aeruginosa strain (ICB 7933), which has a MIC of 0.5 micrograms/ml, killing of stationary cells in vivo was not very pronounced. Electron microscopic evaluation of the pouch exudate revealed that phagocytosed and non-phagocytosed E. coli cells were severely damaged in comparison with untreated control cells. The earliest ultrastructural changes could be observed 15 minutes after initiation of therapy. The results demonstrate that ciprofloxacin is effective in mice for the treatment of a local inflammatory abscess harboring a stationary population of E. coli or P. aeruginosa. This specific kind of killing occurs in vivo when drug concentrations are at least eight to 10 times higher than the MIC.\r"

The cost-effectiveness of several of these--low-dose subcutaneous heparin, intermittent pneumatic compression, graduated compression stockings, heparin plus dihydroergotamine, heparin plus stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression plus stockings--was assessed by pooling data from published reports of randomized controlled trials. Using clinical protocols, costs for prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of venous thromboembolism were determined. The expected outcomes and costs of each strategy were then calculated using techniques of decision analysis. The results indicate that stockings are the only prophylactic method that is actually cost-saving. Costs of care average $34 less per admission for patients using stockings than for those receiving no prophylaxis. Most other methods of prophylaxis further reduce thromboembolic risk, but increase costs by $50 to $88 per patient relative to costs for the use of stockings. Differences in the cost-effectiveness of these prophylaxis are more marked, ranging from about $50,000 to almost $500,000 per additional life saved.\r"

The serum samples of study subjects were tested for reactivity with T. cruzi antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and also tested for antibody specific for the 72 and 90 kilodalton (kDa) surface glycoproteins of the parasite in an immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis procedure. Xenodiagnosis using reduviid bugs to detect parasites, and clinical evaluations for cardiac and gastrointestinal disease were performed in patients in whom results of both serologic tests were positive. Of 205 subjects studied, 4.9 percent were infected with T. cruzi, and parasites were isolated from 50 percent of those in whom xenodiagnosis was attempted. No significant cardiac or gastrointestinal abnormalities were detected in the six infected patients who were evaluated clinically. These findings suggest that a sizable proportion of persons in this immigrant group are infected with this organism. Thus, routine serologic testing for antibody to T. cruzi may be warranted in immigrants from these countries, especially in view of the potentially serious consequences of infection with this parasite, and also because of the risk of transmission of T. cruzi by blood transfusion.\r"

Plasma renin-like activity and angiotensin II/III immunoreactivity in stimulated cycles did not differ from unstimulated cycles. Follicular fluid angiotensin II/III immunoreactivity correlated significantly with follicular fluid renin-like activity in stimulated (r = 0.72; p less than 0.01) and in unstimulated samples (r = 0.86; p less than 0.01). Significant correlation was found also between follicular fluid renin-like activity and estradiol. A sharp preovulatory rise of renin-like activity and angiotensin II/III immunoreactivity was noted in unstimulated follicular fluid samples collected on cycle days 13 and 14 compared to days 9 through 12 (p less than 0.01). The findings that follicular fluid renin-like activity and angiotensin II/III immunoreactivity are correlated, and that gonadotropins have a stimulatory effect on follicular fluid concentrations support our concept of a physiologic intrinsic ovarian renin-angiotensin system.\r"

Although the potential for vertical transmission of C. trachomatis from pregnant women to their infants is well established, the extent to which infection adversely affects pregnancy and causes perinatal complications remains controversial. We report herein the results of a prospective study of 270 pregnant women with endocervical C. trachomatis compared with 270 matched control subjects (age +/- 1 year, race, and socioeconomic status). Among the entire group (n = 540), the rates of pregnancy complications were: premature rupture of the membranes, 54/270 (10%); preterm delivery, 55 (11%); amnionitis, 20 (4%); intrapartum fever, 23 (4.3%); small for gestational age, 76 (14.5%); postpartum endometritis, 31 (6%); and neonatal sepsis, 10 (1.8%). No statistically significant differences were noted between cases and controls for any of these variables. In the subset of women with recent or invasive chlamydial infection, indicated by the presence of IgM antibody against C. trachomatis, preterm delivery occurred in 13/67 IgM-positive versus 8/99 IgM-negative (p = 0.03) cases. Premature rupture of the membranes was present in 13/67 IgM-positive versus 8/99 IgM-negative (p = 0.03).\r"

Tissues taken from sites adjacent to tumor or from comparable sites in the nonmalignant uteri were analyzed for number of round cells, density of collagen and reticular fibers, and collagenase activity. The results were correlated with the depth of invasion and the histologic appearances of the tissues adjoining the cancer. Plasma cells and reticular fibers were most numerous in patients with slight invasion and no direct contact between the malignant and benign tissues (C type in CPL classification of Imai). Glycosaminoglycans (mainly hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate) were present in the greatest amounts in C type stroma. The prognosis showed no correlation with either collagen content or collagenase activity but it was a better prognosis correlated with the collagen/collagenase ratio. It is concluded that increased numbers of plasma cells and reticular fibers and a high collagen/collagenase ratio are among the mechanisms protective against the invasiveness of cervical carcinoma.\r"

Platelet aggregation greater than 95% in response to arachidonic acid was observed when incubated plasma without exogenous prostacyclin was assayed. When prostacyclin and platelet-poor plasma were preincubated together, subsequent arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation measured 9.6% in samples from nonpregnant patients, 40.3% in samples from normally pregnant patients, and 78.2% in samples from patients with preeclampsia. The ability of exogenous prostacyclin to inhibit arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation was significantly different in the presence of plasma from nonpregnant, normally pregnant, and preeclamptic women. These observations suggest that a plasma factor may affect the action of prostacyclin during pregnancy.\r"

For determination of the precise sequence of events in the development of vasculitis in autoimmune MRL/lpr mice, histologic sections from 4-20-week-old mice were evaluated with a panel of cytochemical and immunohistochemical stains. The results show that vascular disease in MRL/lpr mice develops as follows: Thy 1+, Ly 1+, L3T4- T cells assemble around predominantly small-to-medium muscular arteries at approximately 8 weeks of age. At 12 weeks of age, an adventitial inflammatory focus forms, composed of large \"reactive\" mononuclear inflammatory cells adjacent to hypertrophied vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Blastic Thy 1+, Ly 1+, L3T4- T cells subsequently infiltrate the tunica media, and selective VSMC karyolysis results. Occasional cytotoxic/suppressor T cells, macrophages, and possibly NK cells are noted primarily distal to the infiltration site. The outer zone of the inflammatory infiltrate is composed of mature B cells and occasional B-cell precursors. These findings suggest that cellular constituents of the immune response mediate mononuclear cell vasculitis in MRL/lpr mice.\r"

These structures generally consisted of hexagonally packed lattices with a 6.9-nm point-to-point spacing. JTB18 and CNK10 had no structures in their granules. The attack of one clone, JT3, on two resistant target tumor cell lines, KG1 and Laz509, was also examined under three conditions. First, JT3 cells and targets were incubated together. There was little adherence, degranulation, or killing. Second, cells were incubated with anti-T11(2) and T11(3), antibodies against the E-rosette receptor/antigen complex, which activate resting T cells and enhance cytolytic activity of NK clones and CTL. JT3 cells adhered to the targets, formed zones of apposition between NK and target cell membranes, polarized, and degranulated into the space between the two cells, killing the targets. Third, cells were incubated with both anti-T11(2/3) and anti-LFA-1, an antibody that inhibits adherence. The JT3 cells did not form zones of apposition with the targets, but degranulated in discrete areas on their own surface. In all cases, discharged crystalline granules transformed to sheets of membrane and vesicles. These studies suggest that phospholipids are packed in hexagonal lattices in the granules of the resting cells and transform to bilayer structures during exocytosis. The crystalline nature of the granule may immobilize lytic molecules and protect the resting cell from lysis. Further, the vesicles may serve to transport the lytic molecules from the effector to the target cell. Anti-LFA-1 does not inhibit target recognition or exocytosis, but instead blocks membrane interactions of the effector cell with its target.\r"

Although both immune T lymphocyte populations can induce cardiac inflammation in vivo, ACTLs predominantly cause tissue injury. VSCTL generation can be inhibited by either anti-Tac (antibody to the interleukin 2 [IL-2] receptor) or anti-Iad but not by anti-IAk, indicating that this response is probably both IL-2-dependent and Class II (major histocompatibility complex [MHC] antigen restricted.

The phenotype of these RS- and L/H-like cells was determined with a large panel of antibodies and lectins. The cells expressed sialylated Leu-M1, Con A, LN-2, and, less frequently, interleukin-1, S-100, and peanut agglutinin receptor. They reacted negatively with two markers for RS cells, Ki-1 and HeFi-1. These RS-like cells were consistently negative for T- and B-cell markers, including immunoglobulins. The markers of the RS-like cells are distinctly different from those in B-immunoblasts, but closely resemble those in interdigitating reticulum cells. It is concluded that interdigitating reticulum cells, when stimulated, can be transformed into lacunar-, L/H-, or RS-like cells.\r"

  ".W": "The basis of Medicare's prospective payment for alcohol, drug abuse, and mental illness hospital admissions has been the patient classification system known as diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). This paper describes two alternative patient classification systems, disease staging and clinically related groups, and reports how well each system predicts resource use compared to the DRG system. Medicare data from four states were used to test the comparative strength of these patient classification systems. Although disease staging and clinically related groups performed better than DRGs, they were still poor predictors of resource use.\r"
