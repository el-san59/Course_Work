Peak saccadic velocity for the AIDS group was significantly lower than that of the control group for both adducting and abducting saccades (P less than .001). Saccadic duration for the AIDS group was significantly greater than that of the controls for both adducting and abducting saccades (P less than .02 for adduction and P less than .01 for abduction). There was no difference in saccadic latencies between the two groups. We add slowed saccades to the ocular motility manifestations of AIDS. Our study indicated that analysis of ocular motility may be of value in providing early detection of neurologic dysfunction, and may also be an important quantitative measure of the responsiveness of patients to different types of potential therapies.\r"

  ".W": "We examined retinal tissue from eight human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex for evidence of dual infection with HIV-1 and cytomegalovirus. Culture demonstrated simultaneous infection with HIV-1 and cytomegalovirus in two of 13 retinal specimens. This was confirmed by both immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, coinfection of individual cells with cytomegalovirus and HIV-1 was observed by immunohistochemical staining. Infection of retina with cytomegalovirus or HIV-1 alone occurred in one and six of the 13 retinal specimens, respectively. HIV-1 antigens were present on scattered cells in all layers of the retina and on retinal vascular endothelium. HIV-1 was isolated from retinal tissue derived from eyes both with and without gross ocular lesions. Cytomegalovirus antigens were found in all layers of the retina, but not on vascular endothelial cells. The atypically rapid clinical progression of retinitis in one of the patients with dual HIV-1 and cytomegalovirus infection suggests the possibility that interactions between these two viruses may influence retinal disease in patients with AIDS.\r"

The results with the extraocular balloon were compared with results of a similar group of detachments treated with an intraocular gas bubble. The primary attachment rate with the expanding gas operation was 91%; 11% of these eyes redetached. Although the final attachment rate was 99%, the complications after gas were much more frequent and of serious consequence.\r"

Psychiatric disorders pose particular problems (etiologic heterogeneity, incomplete penetrance, variable expressivity) for genetic research. New practical and ethical questions also arise. Nevertheless, knowledge may emerge that will suggest new approaches to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.\r"

Through projective identification, staff members unconsciously identify with projected aspects of the patient and behave accordingly. A clearer conceptual understanding of splitting in the hospital allows for its differentiation from common variants of splitting and for the development of strategies to manage splitting.\r"

The PCL, thus, along with the ACL, contributes to the \"screwhome mechanism\" of the knee. The anatomy of the meniscofemoral ligaments (ligaments of Wrisberg and Humphrey) reveals the intimate relationship among the PCL, the popliteus muscle, and the lateral meniscus. Understanding the anatomy of the PCL is important in the diagnosis and treatment of ligamentous injuries and also in total knee arthroplasty.\r"

We analyzed the subjective function, loss of motion and shoulder strength of three operative procedures: Magnuson-Stack, Bristow, and Putti-Platt. A retrospective review of 27 patients, 9 in each surgical group, with no postoperative dislocations or on-going pain was performed. All patients were male, right hand dominant with the right shoulder affected. Average time of followup was 6.75 years (range, 4.2 to 10.3 years). All patients completed a questionnaire and had their range of motion measured by a hand-held goniometer and their shoulder strength tested on the Cybex II Dynomometer. Peak torque as a percent of body weight and side-to-side differences were calculated for six arm positions and compared to nine right hand dominant controls of similar age and recreational activity. Sixty percent returned to throwing sport. One Magnuson-Stack and Bristow patient felt full functional return to preinjury level. Three patients in each of these two groups returned to unmodified throwing sport whereas no Putti-Platt patient attained this level. Deficit of external rotation at shoulder neutral measured 4.7 degrees, Magnuson-Stack; 12.2 degrees, Bristow; and 21.8 degrees, Putti-Platt. At 90 degrees shoulder abduction, similar deficits in external rotation measured 6.4 degrees, 11.6 degrees, and 28.8 degrees respectively. These values were statistically significant employing analysis of variance. We compared the operative groups as a whole to the controls and compared the operative groups to each other.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The FCR-3 (Gambia) isolate appears to be fully dependent on the N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc) residues of the O-linked tetrasaccharide of glycophorin for invasion. Invasion of the CDC-1 (Honduras) isolate into neuraminidase treated erythrocytes is 50% of that into normal erythrocytes. This and additional results suggest that this isolate is not fully dependent on the O-linked saccharides of glycophorin. In the present study, invasion of CDC-1 and FCR-3 isolates into erythrocytes was examined in the presence of Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies directed against different domains of glycophorin. Fab fragments directed against the carbohydrate domain inhibited invasion of both isolates but inhibited invasion by the FCR-3 isolate more than CDC-1 isolate. The reactivity of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) directed against the carbohydrate domain was dependent on the NeuNAc residues as binding was abolished in neuraminidase treated erythrocytes. Mabs directed against the peptide domain of glycophorin A did not significantly inhibit invasion by either isolate. These results are consistent with other findings that the CDC-1 isolate is not fully dependent on the carbohydrate domain of glycophorin for invasion.\r"

During the early subacute stage (26-30 days postinfection), sarcolemmal and perivascular deposits of laminin and fibronectin were prominent. The presence of fibronectin appeared to correlate with the presence of inflammatory cells. By the late subacute phase and early chronic phase (50-90 and 80-90 days postinfection, respectively), laminin and Type IV collagen were present. These were the principal features, although fibronectin continued to be found among inflammatory cells, and pro-III and III collagens formed irregular bands and periarteriolar deposits. During the late chronic phase (150-200 days postinoculation) the interstitium was enlarged and irregular, with positive staining for laminin, Types III, pro-III, and IV collagens; fibronectin appeared as focal, subendocardial, interstitial, and perivascular deposits. The relative absence of Type I collagen and the apparent positive correlation between interstitial matrix amplification and the presence of mononuclear inflammatory cells suggest that fibrotic changes in chronic T. cruzi myocarditis can be reversed if the inflammatory changes subside.\r"

With the use of a low molecular weight (LMW) fraction of a soluble, adult Onchocerca volvulus extract as an antigen, the problem of nonspecificity observed with the crude worm extract is negligible. Seventy-three sera from proven cases of other filarial infections were weakly reactive or nonreactive. From cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys in a West African village hyperendemic for onchocerciasis, we concluded that this assay detects antibodies elicited when female worms start to produce microfilariae. Thirty-two of 33 children aged less than or equal to 15 years with positive skin snips were seropositive. High antibody levels could also be found in children who only became parasitologically positive 1-4 years after seroconversion. This leads to the conclusion that serology is more sensitive than the 2-snip method. In individuals with chronic infection (exposed for greater than 15 years), antibody titers were consistently lower (independent of the density of skin microfilariae) than in the early phase of a patent infection. A comparative serological study in a mesoendemic village revealed that the assay can serve to assess onchocerciasis prevalence by testing individuals aged 5-15 years.\r"

Large numbers of intact eosinophils were present in the brain around blood vessels and necrotic migration tracks and in mesenteric granulomata. Extensive extracellular MBP deposition was present in the necrotic migration tracks in the brain and around larvae in the mesenteric granulomata in association with the radiating eosinophilic deposits characteristic of the \"Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon.\" The Splendore-Hoeppli deposits consist in part of eosinophil granule MBP.

We investigated whether long-term cholecystokinin (CCK) administration might affect growth or metabolism of human tumors xenografted in nude mice. In each experiment, approximately 20 nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts of the particular cancer line being studied were used. Half received CCK and half received saline solution intraperitoneally twice daily for 14 days. Tumor volume and body weight were measured every 3 days. If the tumors produced marker substances, these were measured in nude mouse serum and also in the xenografts. Tumor growth was significantly retarded by CCK in two of the six cancers studied. In each case, DNA, RNA, and protein reflected tumor volumes. In one of these tumors (SLU 077), serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels paralleled the tumor volumes. In another tumor (SLU 132), serum CEA levels and tumor immunolabeling for CEA and pancreatic oncofetal antigen increased in response to CCK administration, whereas tumor volumes did not. These findings suggest that exogenous highdose CCK altered the growth and metabolism in two of six human cancers studied.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with successfully managed breast cancer have generally been denied subsequent exposure to increased levels of estrogen (endogenous or exogenous) based on the belief that exacerbation of the cancer would occur. The advent of oral contraceptives, the trend toward childbearing later in life, and the demonstration of the protective value of menopausal estrogen replacement therapy against osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease requires that this issue be reexamined. New information bearing on this subject includes the recognition of estrogen receptors, the isolation of youth rather than pregnancy as the factor resulting in poor prognosis, epidemiologic studies showing no increased risk of breast cancer in women using oral contraceptives or taking hormonal replacement therapy, the beneficial effect of pregnancy subsequent to successfully managed breast cancer, and the absence of an adverse effect of oral contraceptives upon established breast cancer. In view of the lack of evidence relating estrogen to exacerbation of existing breast cancer, it may be in the best interest of our patients to liberalize our attitude to renewed hormonal exposure in patients with successfully managed breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Intraoperative data from 42 adult orthotopic hepatic transplant recipients were analyzed retrospectively to assess the hemodynamic, coagulation, and thermal effects of heparinless veno-venous bypass using a constrained vortex pump. Transient hemodynamic changes occurring at the onset of bypass included decreases in temperature (-10.7%), heart rate (-18.7%) and arterial pressure (-15.1%); and increases in central venous pressure (27.6%) and ECG T wave amplitude (231.6%). Abrupt decreases in cardiac output and pump flow occurred with termination of the portal limb of bypass, which is required to allow completion of the portal vein anastomosis. However, significant continuous decreases were observed in bypass flow and cardiac output during the entire bypass period. The blood volume became concentrated as indicated by increases in hematocrit, colloid osmotic pressure, serum osmolality and serum sodium. Changes in colloid osmotic pressure were inversely related to bypass flow. These data, along with an accumulating base deficit, suggest that veno-venous bypass is associated with less than optimal perfusion of the abdomen and lower extremities. Flow dependent third space fluid accumulation is most likely responsible for decreasing cardiac output and pump flow during the bypass period. No clinically significant coagulopathy could be attributed to the use of veno-venous bypass. There were no significant changes in platelet counts, fibrinogen levels or prothrombin times. The activated partial thromboplastin time decreased from 60.5 to 50.2 seconds. Patient core temperature decreased three times more rapidly (0.9 degrees C/hr) during bypass than at any other time during the procedure.\r"

Following administration of an analgesic loading dose, patients were allowed to self-administer morphine 1.8 mg, meperidine 18 mg, or oxymorphone 0.3 mg iv every 8 min as required. Data collected during the 24-h observation period included visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores at rest and during movement, VAS patient satisfaction scores, total drug administered, the ratio of attempts/injections, and the incidence of nausea/vomiting, sedation, and pruritus. After adjusting for narcotic potency, no differences in 24-h dose requirements were noted between treatment groups (NS). All patients achieved an excellent level of analgesia at rest (NS); however, onset was most rapid with oxymorphone (P less than 0.05). The percentage of patients reporting severe pain during movement was highest in the meperidine group (P less than 0.05). Oxymorphone was associated with the highest incidence of nausea and vomiting (P less than 0.05), whereas increased sedation and pruritus were noted with morphine. Patient satisfaction with drug effect demonstrated significant negative correlations with resting pain scores and degree of sedation. Whereas morphine is a more commonly utilized PCA analgesic, the excellent analgesia, low incidence of sedation, and high patient satisfaction provided by meperidine and oxymorphone suggested useful alternatives.\r"

There were 41,107 deliveries and 46 obstetric hysterectomies, an incidence of 0.11%. Twenty-five hysterectomies were elective and 21 were emergent. The indication for 11 of the 21 emergency hysterectomies was placenta previa and/or accreta. Women in the emergency group had greater intraoperative blood loss, were more likely to have intraoperative hypotension, and were more likely to receive donor blood than women in the elective group (P less than 0.05). Twelve patients (eight from the elective group and four from the emergency group) received continuous epidural anesthesia, and none required intraoperative induction of general anesthesia. There was no evidence that epidural anesthesia significantly affected blood loss, crystalloid replacement, or requirement for transfusion in the elective group. Abnormal placentation now represents a major indication for emergency obstetric hysterectomy. Furthermore, significant hemorrhage is more likely with emergency obstetric hysterectomy than with elective hysterectomy. Finally, elective cesarean hysterectomy is not a contraindication to performance of continuous epidural anesthesia.\r"

The patients were randomly assigned to receive no premedication (n = 19); 0.25 ml/kg of the oral solution (containing meperidine, 1.5 mg/kg, diazepam, 0.2 mg/kg, and atropine, 0.02 mg/kg, n = 20); or OTFC (15-20 micrograms/kg, n = 20). Children had activity (sedation) and anxiety scores, vital signs (including systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures and heart and respiratory rates) and pulse oximetry determined oxygen saturation measured before and at 10-min intervals after premedication until they were taken to the operating room. Quality of induction and recovery was evaluated using scoring schedules; recovery times were measured and side effects noted. OTFC was readily accepted and provided significant reductions in preoperative activity (sedation) and anxiety starting after 30 min. After OTFC, sedation and anxiolysis were significantly greater than in children having no premedication but similar to children having the oral solution for premedication. Vital signs and oxygen saturations remained unchanged preoperatively in all groups. Induction and recovery evaluations and recovery times were similar in the three groups, although children having OTFC had the lowest requirements for narcotics in the recovery room. OTFC caused an 80% incidence of mild preoperative facial pruritus and a higher overall incidence of postoperative vomiting (37%) than premedication with the oral solution (5%) or no premedication (18%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Adequate data on environmental exposure are rarely presented. Case series on aluminum potroom workers over the past 50 years have identified an asthmalike syndrome that appears to be due to an irritant rather than an allergic mechanism. These studies have been supported by evidence of within shift variability of measures of lung function. However, to date, there is inadequate evidence to resolve the question of whether potroom exposure initiates asthma or merely precipitates asthmalike symptoms in a predisposed individual. Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated evidence of reduced lung function, consistent with chronic airflow limitation. In exposed aluminum smelter workers compared to unexposed control subjects. Cigarette smoking, the major potential confounding variable, has been measured and accounted for in multivariate analyses. To date, evidence is lacking from longitudinal studies about the development of disabling chronic obstructive lung disease. Exposure to coal tar pitch volatiles in the production and consumption of anodes has biologic plausibility for an association of lung cancer with work in an aluminum smelter. Although retrospective mortality studies have failed to account for the probable high prevalence of smoking in blue collar workers, the relative risk of lung cancer is very low if present at all. Pulmonary fibrosis has not been shown to be a significant problem in aluminum smelter workers. Future research in the aluminum industry needs to concentrate on longitudinal studies, preferably with an inception cohort for the investigation of potroom asthma.\r"

  ".W": "A method is presented for the objective monitoring of the inflammatory response of the nasal mucosa to natural allergen exposure through measurements of biochemical markers such as TAME-esterase activity in a daily nasal lavage. Nine patients with strictly seasonal allergic rhinitis caused by birch pollen and five healthy nonatopic control subjects participated in the present study, which started 1 wk before the birch pollen season and continued throughout the entire pollen season. A diary card was used to assess daily nasal symptoms, and a daily nasal lavage was performed once every afternoon. The degree of pollen exposure was assessed by daily pollen counts. The TAME-esterase activity in the lavage fluid from the allergic patients, but not in that from the nonallergic control subjects, increased significantly during pollen exposure despite low pollen counts and was found to correlate with daily nasal symptoms (r = 0.36; p less than 0.05) and the degree of pollen exposure (r = 0.45; p less than 0.01). The area under the curve for the daily TAME-esterase measurements thus differed significantly (p less than 0.02) between allergic patients (158 +/- 28) and control subjects (74 +/- 9). This approach for the monitoring of patients with hay fever during natural allergen exposure will make further objective studies on the pathophysiology and pharmacology of hay fever possible. We also provide support for the validity of previous findings obtained in allergen challenge situations utilizing the lavage approach.\r"

RESULTS: During the study period, 630,190 units of blood (donations) from an estimated 290,110 Minnesota-resident donors were screened for HIV-1 antibody. Seventeen Minnesota-resident donors were identified as positive for HIV-1 antibody. Sixteen donors were available for follow-up HIV-1 culture: all were culture positive. The other donor, who was not available for follow-up culture, was likely infected with HIV-1 based on a history of high-risk behavior and positive serologic findings for hepatitis B surface antigen. Using 95% binomial confidence intervals, performance characteristics for sequential EIA and Western blot HIV-1 antibody serology were as follows: false-positive rate by number of donations, 0% to 0.0006%; specificity by number of donations, 99.9994% to 100%; predictive value of a positive test, 81% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: In this low-risk population, the false-positive rate of serologic tests for HIV-1 antibody, using HIV-1 culture as the definitive standard for infection status, was extremely low and test specificity was extremely high.\r"

Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein levels are risk factors for coronary disease and early mortality in middle-aged men. Weaker evidence suggests that hypercholesterolemia increases the risk for coronary disease in women or elderly men, or that hypertriglyceridemia increases the risk in men or women. A reduction in cholesterol levels lowers the incidence of and the mortality from coronary disease in asymptomatic, hypercholesterolemic, middle-aged men, but has not been shown to reduce overall mortality. The efficacy of treatment in women and elderly persons has not been studied. Screening and treatment plans should be individualized; a 5-year period between tests is adequate for asymptomatic, low-risk men, whereas more frequent testing is appropriate for high-risk men. Screening is optional for women and elderly persons.\r"

Symposium participants concluded that the risk of HIV infection for health care workers is low but not zero. Implementation of universal blood and body fluid precautions was agreed to as an appropriate method of preventing exposure to HIV, especially for preventing needlestick accidents. Current standards for hospital waste disposal were judged to be adequate to prevent transmission of HIV, and confidential testing for HIV antibody in health care workers with follow-up counseling was recommended where indicated. It was also agreed that the risk of occupational exposure to HIV does not free health care workers from the responsibility to provide care to infected persons.\r"

The doses were then tapered over 2 weeks and discontinued. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The endpoint of the study was death. Of the 31 recipients of placebo, 11 (35%) died within 28 days of randomization compared with 2 (6%) of the 35 patients given methylprednisolone (P = 0.006). The 95% CI for the difference in mortality was 12% to 70%. In the patients with spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy at entry, 9 of 19 recipients of placebo died (47%) compared with 1 (7%) of the 14 patients given methylprednisolone (P = 0.02). The 95% CI for the difference in mortality was 14% to 66%. The Cox proportional hazards regression model showed the advantage of methylprednisolone over placebo after adjustment for other potentially important prognostic variables (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Methylprednisolone therapy decreases short-term mortality in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis manifested either by spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy or a markedly elevated discriminant function value.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To familiarize the general internist with the unique features of pulmonary edema occurring in association with tocolytic therapy (drugs used to inhibit uterine contractions). DATA IDENTIFICATION: The literature in English was searched using MEDLINE (1.966 to 1988), and bibliographies of pertinent articles and texts were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION: Fifty-eight case reports were examined by both authors and served as the database. DATA EXTRACTION: Several clinical variables, when available, were extracted from each case reported. Each variable was analyzed to provide an accurate composite description of pulmonary edema resulting from tocolytic therapy. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Patients with this syndrome present with dyspnea and may or may not have chest pain. Women at risk are receiving or have recently received sympathomimetic agents to arrest uterine contractions, with or without steroids. The incidence of the syndrome is higher in women with twin gestations. In postpartum cases, the syndrome usually occurs within 12 hours of delivery. Most women have intact membranes at presentation. Patients rarely have hypotension but usually have tachycardia and tachypnea. Chest roentgenograms usually show bilateral alveolar infiltrates and a normal-sized heart. Arterial blood gas values reveal an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. Hemodilution may cause a decrease in potassium values and the hematocrit. Patients respond rapidly to treatment with diuresis and oxygen administration and show clinical improvement usually within 24 hours. The underlying mechanism appears to be related to increased hydrostatic pressure and not to increased permeability or a direct toxic effect of tocolytic agents. CONCLUSIONS: Familiarity with the clinical features outlined above should increase the internist's ability to manage this problem without further invasive or noninvasive testing that might otherwise be used in evaluating dyspnea in pregnancy.\r"

Protecting persons from unknowingly being exposed to HIV infection must be balanced against respecting the autonomy of individuals being screened. Seropositive patients may feel a stigma and be subjected to discrimination if confidentiality of test results is breached. In patients without high-risk behaviors, the positive predictive value of HIV testing may be substantially increased if tests are done in reference laboratories and if further confirmatory tests are run on a second blood specimen. For persons with high-risk behaviors, HIV testing can be recommended to those who want to reduce uncertainty about their HIV status or whose medical care would change if they were seropositive. Health care workers can maximize benefits of screening and minimize harm by educating and counseling patients before HIV testing, discussing the confidentiality of HIV test results, urging patients to disclose positive test results to sex partners, and advising patients on how to reduce high-risk behaviors.\r"

  ".W": "In an open trial, five patients with lamellar ichthyosis showed no response to four weeks of treatment with oral cyclosporine (cyclosporine A) (6 mg/kg/d). Histologic examination of lamellar ichthyosis revealed hyperkeratosis; psoriasiform acanthosis; dilated, tortuous capillaries; and a slight perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Immunofluorescence studies revealed, in the epidermis, normal numbers of T6+DR+ Langerhans' cells and an absence of T cells and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression. In the papillary dermis, there were prominent capillaries as detected by staining with anti-factor VIII-related antigen. The endothelial cells also expressed large amounts of HLA-DR and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, suggesting that they were activated. Only occasional Langerhans' cells were found in the dermis. Histologic and immunofluorescence findings were unchanged with cyclosporine therapy. The effects of cyclosporine on lamellar ichthyosis are contrasted with those reported for psoriasis. Since lamellar ichthyosis and psoriasis share similar features of epidermal hyperproliferation and the presence of activated, dilated, tortuous vessels, but differ in the lack of immunologic cellular activity, their contrasting response to cyclosporine suggests that the target of the action of cyclosporine is the immune system rather than the keratinocyte or the endothelium. However, other factors may have to be considered.\r"

The increase in basal cell carcinoma was found only in patients with exposure to other carcinogenic agents, whereas the increase in SCC was also seen in patients without such exposures. Cumulative UVA dosage was not correlated with the development of basal cell carcinoma, but there was a trend of increasing numbers of SCCs in patients with higher dosages. Five of 9 patients had SCCs on sites that were not sun exposed. All patients with tumors had them treated surgically, and, to date, none have recurred. This study confirms a previous report of an increase in the incidence of SCC in psoriatic patients treated with PUVA.\r"

  ".W": "A murine monoclonal antibody (19-DEJ-1) was recently produced that recognizes a unique antigenic epitope of human skin basement membrane localized to the midlamina lucida exclusively in those areas bordered by overlying hemidesmosomes. To determine whether the antigen defined by 19-DEJ-1 is normally expressed in one or more forms of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) known to have structural and antigenic defects in skin basement membrane, we examined by indirect immunofluorescence 46 specimens of clinically normal skin from 43 patients representing each of the four forms of inherited EB (simplex, 15 patients; junctional, nine patients; dominant dystrophic, seven patients; and recessive dystrophic, 15 patients). All nine junctional EB specimens revealed absent 19-DEJ-1 binding; similarly, seven of 15 and one of six recessive and dominant dystrophic EB skin specimens, respectively, showed lack of antibody recognition. In contrast, binding was normal in 15 of 15 EB simplex specimens and five of six dominant dystrophic EB specimens. Absent binding of 19-DEJ-1 to junctional EB skin correlates well with the localization of this antigen to the region of the midlamina lucida. Its absence in approximately 50% of patients with recessive dystrophic EB further suggests, for the first time, that an inherited defect in basement membrane is shared in patients with junctional and some recessive dystrophic EB. The difference in site of skin cleavage in the latter two disorders gives additional support to the hypothesis that 19-DEJ-1 recognizes a structure, such as the anchoring filament, which both bridges the entire basement membrane and contributes to epidermal-dermal adhesion.\r"

Transmission is most likely from a sporadic autosomal dominant mutation. Clinical manifestations are evident by the first or second year of life and include the physical characteristics usually associated with the elderly. Mentally, patients are alert and attentive with normal intelligence and emotions. Histopathologic changes occur primarily in the skin, bone, and cardiovascular tissues, while other organs appear to be unaffected. Laboratory findings are unremarkable, with the exception of an increased urinary excretion of hyaluronic acid. The diagnosis rests on the clinical presentation; at present, no treatment has been proved to be effective. Death results from cardiovascular abnormalities in the majority of cases and usually occurs between the ages of 10 and 15 years. Current research suggests an underlying defect of hyaluronic acid that may possibly account for the entire process.\r"

These include the management of continued active variceal bleeding; therapy after a variceal bleed to prevent further recurrent bleeds; consideration for prophylactic surgical therapy to prevent the first variceal bleed; or, rarely, an unusual cause of portal hypertension which may require some specific surgical therapy. Injection sclerotherapy is the most widely used treatment for both acute variceal bleeding and long-term management after a variceal bleed. Unfortunately it has probably been overused in the past. The need to identify the failures of sclerotherapy early and to treat them by other forms of major surgery is emphasized. The selective distal splenorenal shunt is the most widely used portosystemic shunt today, particularly in nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients. The standard portacaval shunt is still used for the management of acute variceal bleeding as well as for long-term management, particularly in alcoholic cirrhotic patients. For acute variceal bleeding the surgical alternative to sclerotherapy or shunting is simple staple-gun esophageal transection, whereas in long-term management the main alternative is an extensive devascularization and transection operation. Liver transplantation is the only therapy that cures both the portal hypertension and the underlying liver disease. All patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension should be assessed as potential liver transplant recipients. If they are candidates for transplantation, sclerotherapy should be used to treat bleeding varices whenever possible, as this will interfere least with a subsequent liver transplant.\r"

  ".W": "Although esophagomyotomy is highly effective as the initial surgical treatment of most patients with achalasia, those with either recurrent symptoms after a previous esophagomyotomy or a megaesophagus do not respond as well to esophagomyotomy. Total thoracic esophagectomy was performed in 26 patients (average age, 49 years) with achalasia. Eighteen had a history of a previous esophagomyotomy, and 18 had a megaesophagus (esophageal diameter of 8 cm or larger). In 24 patients, a transhiatal esophagectomy without thoracotomy was the operative approach; 2 patients required a transthoracic esophagectomy because of intrathoracic adhesions from prior operations. The stomach was used as the esophageal substitute in all patients; it was positioned in the posterior mediastinum, and a cervical anastomosis was performed. Intraoperative blood loss averaged 765 mL. Major postoperative complications included mediastinal bleeding requiring thoracotomy (2), chylothorax (2), and anastomotic leak (1). There were no postoperative deaths. The average postoperative hospital stay was ten days. Follow-up is complete and ranges from 3 to 91 months (average duration, 30 months). All but 1 patient with severe psychiatric disease eat a regular, unrestricted diet without postprandial regurgitation. Early postoperative anastomotic dilation was required in 10 patients. Dumping syndrome has occurred in 5 patients. It is concluded that esophagectomy provides the most reliable treatment of esophageal obstruction, pulmonary complications, and potential late development of carcinoma in the patient with a megaesophagus of achalasia or a failed prior esophagomyotomy and that it is a far better option in these patients than esophagomyotomy, cardioplasty procedures, or limited esophageal resection.\r"

Unipolar peak-to-peak amplitude analysis has been shown to be a quantitative measure of ischemic myocardial injury. This study was performed to determine if unipolar peak-to-peak amplitude analysis could accurately detect cardiac allograft rejection as determined by blinded endomyocardial biopsies. Ten adult mongrel dogs underwent heterotopic (n = 7) or orthotopic (n = 3) cardiac transplantation with placement of sutureless screw-in electrodes (Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) on the anterior and posterior aspect of each ventricle. Postoperatively, animals were immunosuppressed for seven to ten days with cyclosporine and prednisone and then allowed to reject the transplant. Digitally processed intramyocardial electrograms were obtained daily. Endomyocardial biopsy was performed 1 week postoperatively and then at three to five day intervals for histological correlation. A unipolar peak-to-peak amplitude decline of 15% or greater occurred one to three days before the biopsy detection in 10 of 10 episodes of rejection. There were no false negatives and one false positive (although a small focal lymphocytic infiltrate was present). Thus, noninvasive unipolar peak-to-peak amplitude analysis was 100% sensitive and 90% specific in predicting and detecting cardiac allograft rejection.\r"

  ".W": "Embolization of a prosthetic valve poppet is a rare but life-threatening event. It was reported sporadically before the introduction of the Bjork-Shiley 70-degree convexoconcave prosthesis in 1980. Since that time, there have been a large number of reported mechanical failures with disc escape. The rate for the 29-mm to 33-mm mitral valves is estimated as 5.2%. In 29 of 35 patients (including the 2 presented here) in whom the site of disc lodgment could be determined, the disc was in the descending or abdominal aorta. Fifteen of these patients died. Six survivors had the disc removed at the same operation and 6 at a later operation. In 2 patients, the disc was not removed. In 2 patients in whom the disc was not removed initially, it was thought to contribute to postoperative complications. Two more cases of structural failure of the Bjork-Shiley convexoconcave prosthesis are presented. A transpericardial approach to the descending aorta on bypass is described. It allows easy removal of the disc and eliminates the need for a second operation.\r"

Presenting symptoms of esophageal small cell carcinoma include dysphagia (75.3%), weight loss (38.4%), and chest pain (23.3%). Treatment regimens have included surgical intervention in 58%, radiotherapy in 10%, chemotherapy in 6%, or some combination of these in 26%. Overall survival is only 20.7 weeks after diagnosis.

For psychiatrists, intensity of treatment (ie, mean face-to-face treatment minutes per patient per month) varied from 107 to 368 minutes vs 124 to 283 minutes for psychologists. Multiple regression models explain these variations somewhat differently for each provider group. Whereas the patient's severity or stage of illness is explanatory for both psychiatrists and psychologists, only psychologists appear to alter intensity of treatment in response to local economic conditions. Psychiatrists have large diversified practices, whereas psychologists tend to treat fewer persons and the bulk of these have less severe mental and emotional conditions. Neither practitioner group appeared to provide services in excess of their perceptions of patient need. These and other important similarities and differences are explored, and the advantages of local market focus for examining relevant public policy issues are discussed.\r"

The subjects are the first-degree relatives, spouses, and their controls of patients with affective disorders. None of these subjects had any history of mental disorder as of their initial evaluation. In the subsequent six years, 29 subjects had a first onset of major depression. These first onset subjects were compared with 370 subjects who continued to be free of illness during the six-year follow-up. Personality traits were assessed at the initial evaluation (ie, before the onset of depression in subjects with first onset) by means of scales from five self-report inventories. Lower emotional strength and resiliency significantly differentiated the first onset from the never ill group; overall differences were not found on measures of interpersonal dependency or extraversion. Age was a significant predictor of first onset, both alone (younger age predicted first onsets) and in interaction with personality measures. Among younger subjects (17 to 30 years of age), personality variables did not significantly discriminate between the two comparison groups. Among older subjects (31 to 41 years of age), however, decreased emotional strength, increased interpersonal dependency, and increased thoughtfulness were associated with first onset of depression.\r"

It is hoped that such scales will satisfy the very real need for measures of function which reflect the impact of treatment on patient progress. Unfortunately, some commonly used evaluation instruments are not well suited to this task. The underlying rationale for clinical decision-making based on these scales is examined.\r"

  ".W": "At least six brands of energy-storing prosthetic feet (ESPF) are now commercially available in the US. These are designed to permit lower extremity amputees to participate in a wide variety of activities, such as running and jumping sports, as well as vigorous walking. Although kinesiologic studies of these devices have not been completed, clinical experience suggests that the Flex-Foot provides the highest performance, followed by the Carbon Copy II and the Seattle Foot. The S.A.F.E. Foot, the STEN Foot, and the Dynamic Foot provide less energy storage and may be suitable for less active patients or those with special needs such as walking on uneven ground. All of the ESPF except the Flex-Foot may be attached to a realigned conventional prosthesis. The Flex-Foot incorporates a pylon and foot in one unit and requires special fabrication technologies. The additional cost of most of the ESPF (compared to a Solid Ankle Cushion Heel Foot) may add little to the cost of a finished prosthesis although it provides greatly increased function. The Flex-Foot, however, is significantly more expensive. Advances in kinesiology and materials science are being applied in the design of prosthetic components that are lighter, stronger, and more resilient. Clinicians can now choose from a variety of innovative commercially available devices but have been hampered by a lack of published information. This paper will review the design philosophy, materials, and applications of ESPF, and will supplement the information available from individual manufacturers and the prosthetic literature.\r"

Standard exercise tolerance and Doppler waveform analytic studies of the lower extremity, specifically the right dorsalis pedis artery, were performed before and after three months of pentoxifylline administration (400 mg three times a day). The study group comprised ten subjects (six men and four women) with a mean (+/- SD) age of 60 +/- 3.3 years. Data were analyzed using a paired Student t test.

Seventy-four free flaps were done in 68 patients. Assessable records were available in 52 patients who had 58 reconstructive procedures. The most frequently used flaps were jejunum in 15 patients (25.8%), latissimus dorsi in 11 patients (18.9%), rectus abdominis in eight patients (13.8%), and gracilis in seven patients (12.1%). Major complications occurred in 43.1% of the cases. Total flap loss occurred in eight patients (13.8%); from 1977 through 1982, four (28.6%) of 14 patients had total flap loss, and from 1983 through 1987, four (9.1%) had total flap loss. Partial flap loss occurred in four cases (6.9%). Of the 52 patients, 43 had their problems resolved expeditiously by free-tissue transfer. We conclude that in a university-affiliated Veterans Administration medical center, microvascular reconstruction is an important and necessary surgical tool. Failure rates have decreased markedly with time and increasing experience. Definition of new anatomic microvascular units for transfer has increased the number of reconstructive choices.\r"

Follow-up extended to 72 months (mean, 26 months). Early success was achieved in 12 extremities (57%) and life-table analysis showed continued success to six years in 11 extremities (55%). Of the multiple preoperative factors assessed, only a low-thigh/ankle gradient pressure index (TAGI) of less than 0.55 was predictive of success. Life-table analysis for limbs with a TAGI of less than 0.55 showed an 89% success rate at six years compared with only a 32% success rate for limbs with a TAGI of more than 0.55. Isolated profundaplasty for the treatment of ischemic rest pain can be an efficacious and durable procedure when patients are selected based on objective hemodynamic measurements.\r"

The effect of Escherichia coli virulence on lung microvascular permeability was studied in sheep with chronic pulmonary lymph fistulas following peritoneal contamination. The study was divided into four groups: (1) wild-type E coli (WT group, 2.5 x 10(9) colony-forming units [CFUs]/kg); (2) virulent E coli (PV group, 2.3 x 10(9) CFUs/kg); (3) nonvirulent E coli (PNV group, 2.6 x 10(9) CFUs/kg); (4) high-inoculum wild-type E coli (HIWT group, 6.1 x 10(9) CFUs/kg). In the late period (two to six hours), the increase in lung lymph flow in the PV group was significantly greater than the WT, PNV, and HIWT groups, with no difference noted among groups with respect to the pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, or albumin lymph/plasma ratio. It was concluded that (1) increased E coli virulence results in increased lung microvascular damage and (2) increased lung microvascular damage as a function of E coli virulence may not be solely due to increased bacterial numbers as a function of time.\r"

Over the last 20 years, we have performed six terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomies for urinary drainage during kidney transplantation. Neurogenic bladder in five patients and exstrophy in one patient prohibited use of the bladder. Four long-term graft survivors (19 months and 4, 10, and 20 years) experienced no short-term problems with the procedure, but two episodes of pyelonephritis have occurred. In our patients no graft dysfunction or loss could be attributed to infection, and no stomal stenosis or revision has occurred. We conclude that terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy is feasible using normal-caliber ureters, and is a safe, effective means of urinary drainage during kidney transplantation when the bladder is not available. It also eliminates the necessity of preparatory bowel surgery that has its attendant risk of contamination in an immunocompromised patient.\r"

Almost half the defects appear more than 12 months after celiotomy. \"Buttonholing\" of the rectus sheath by a sawing motion of the continuous nonabsorbable suture may be responsible for this later herniation. Suturing with synthetic, slowly absorbed monofilament may reduce delayed herniation. The recurrence rate after primary repair was 24.8% (n = 206), and after a second repair the recurrence rate was 41.7% (n = 36). Plastic prostheses, used only in difficult cases (18% of the sample), were associated with a recurrence rate similar to that associated with sutures because of protrusion around the edge. The use of larger and better fixed (\"sandwich\") polypropylene mesh (Marlex) is indicated. Subxiphoid epigastric hernias following sternotomy do not require prosthetic herniorrhaphy.\r"

Fifteen dogs underwent bilateral common carotid endarterectomies. In each dog, one artery was closed primarily and the contralateral artery was closed by vein-patch angioplasty. At six and 12 weeks after operation, luminal prostanoid production from the venous patch, adjacent endarterectomized artery, and control artery and vein was measured by radioimmunoassay for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2. Venous patches underwent \"incomplete\" biochemical adaptation with decreased luminal production of PGI2 compared with control and endarterectomized arteries. Thromboxane production from venous patches was increased compared with normal vein but similar to control and endarterectomized arteries. At six weeks, PGI2 production of vein-patched arterial segments was increased compared with arteries closed primarily. These data indicate that vein-patch angioplasty favorably influences surface thrombogenicity of healing, endarterectomized arteries and support its use in reparative carotid surgery.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo binding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to renal glomeruli of rats was examined. 125I-dsDNA (600 basepairs) was perfused with 131I-IgG as a blood marker into the right renal artery of normal rats, and blood flow was restored. After 10 minutes, isolated glomeruli showed a specific uptake of DNA, which increased in a saturable fashion with increasing doses of administered DNA. To exclude the possibility that 125I in the glomeruli represented only DNA breakdown products, we extracted the DNA from the glomeruli for analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The extracted DNA was 120-200 bp in size, which is large enough to bind antibodies to DNA. In contrast, the radioactivity of DNA taken up by the liver or renal tissues other than glomeruli was predominantly trichloroacetic acid soluble, i.e., less than 15 bp. Immunofluorescence studies showed that antibodies to DNA, administered after DNA, were present in glomeruli. Our data indicate that dsDNA binds to glomeruli in vivo in a saturable manner, and remains large enough to be antigenic. Therefore, the binding of DNA to glomeruli, followed by interaction with antibodies to dsDNA may be a mechanism for DNA-anti-DNA complex formation in glomeruli in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

Analysis of the effect size measures revealed that the average treatment effect was in the medium range (0.69). Further data analysis exposed a statistically significant difference in mean effect size values across articles contained in the four rehabilitation journals. A regression analysis indicated that characteristics of the study design were not significant predictors of effect size values in the 100 studies. The interpretation of effect size measures in relation to statistical significance testing is discussed and the argument made that reporting measures of effect size will assist researchers in determining the sensitivity of experimental manipulations in rehabilitation research.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of maximum hand grip strength in ergonomic or clinical settings has been a useful means of assessing physical characteristics, progress in rehabilitation and degree of disability in upper extremity injuries. The validity of the peak forces observed in such measurements is compromised by the requirement of subject cooperation in giving a maximum effort. Thus, an easily administered analysis of subject sincerity would improve this basic strength-testing tool. Several variables were developed for the discrimination of faking (submaximal) from sincere (maximal) grip contractions. A microcomputer-based grip force data collection system was assembled in which analog output from a Jamar hand dynamometer was sampled at 200 Hz and digitally analyzed. A total of 43 normal subjects (20 male, 23 female) were tested under sincere and faking conditions (three trials of each condition for each hand). The force-time curves of each trial were analyzed for peak and average forces and force variability. From these basic parameters five discriminator variables were developed. The frequency distribution of the sincere values for each of these variables was used to determine a criterion value for discrimination of sincere from faking trials. The five discriminators correctly detected 95.0, 92.5, 100, 100 and 97.5% of the male faking trials. Female faking was less successfully detected: 59.7, 52.2, 78.3, 71.7 and 87.0% correct detection resulted for the variables (with a 95% confidence level of correctly identifying sincerity). Multiple variable predictions improved the female faking detection up to 93.5% with little apparent decrement in sensitivity to sincerity identification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This paper highlights this decision process in two patients, and offers the physician a practical overview of posttraumatic hydrocephalus and its management.\r"

Each performed sustained exercise at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction for three minutes on a handgrip dynamometer. Cardiac output was measured by combined Doppler and cross sectional echocardiography before exercise and every 30 seconds during and after exercise. In the controls cardiac output and blood pressure increased significantly owing to an increase in heart rate with no change in stroke volume. In the transplant group cardiac output, heart rate, and stroke volume remained unchanged throughout exercise. In contrast with its response to dynamic exercise the denervated human heart is unable to increase cardiac output during isometric exercise. The pressor response that occurs is mediated via an increase in peripheral vascular resistance.\r"

The haemodynamic response of sustained treatment with felodipine as a single agent in stable angina was investigated in a double blind crossover study of 25 patients. The dosage of felodipine was increased from 5 mg twice daily to 10 mg twice daily after two weeks. Twenty one patients completed the study, two were withdrawn because of acute myocardial infarction, and a further two because of symptoms of vasodilatation. Felodipine reduced both supine and erect blood pressure and increased the resting heart rate. Median exercise time was increased by 10% at two weeks and 7% at four weeks. There was a sustained reduction in the number of angina attacks and use of sublingual nitrate on active treatment. Felodipine has antianginal effects but these are limited and seem less than those of other related compounds. This finding is unexpected and possibly related to increased heart rate.\r"

There were fewer air emboli and cardiovascular sequelae detected in the gun-inserted cement group, and the only patients to show clinically significant cardiovascular abnormalities during insertion of cement and prosthesis were those having cement insertion by hand. We conclude that the incidence of air embolism and associated cardiovascular changes during total hip replacement may be expected to be reduced in those patients in whom a cement gun is used to place the cement.\r"

The present study measured the effects of halothane and methoxyflurane on synaptic facilitation, paired-pulse potentiation, and long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 pyramidal neurones of rat hippocampal slices. Methoxyflurane 0.16vol% and halothane 1.2 vol% depressed population spike amplitudes by approximately 100%, but halothane did so with relatively little (less than 10%) depressant effect on the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). Both agents enhanced EPSP facilitation, halothane more than methoxyflurane. Halothane consistently enhanced paired-pulse population spike potentiation; methoxyflurane sometimes diminished it. Halothane reduced the probability of LTP induction to an extent correlated with block of population spike responses in the inducing stimulus train (r = 0.92); methoxyflurane did not block LTP. The results suggest that these agents affect cortical excitability by multiple actions, the distribution of actions being specific to each agent.\r"

One Venturi was partially blocked and performed inadequately, but the function of a second one was close to the manufacturer's specification (inspired oxygen 33%, flow 20 litre min-1 against end-expiratory pressures of 0-1.8 kPa). Compliance curves for two reservoir bags (new and old) were defined; these showed that compliance increased as the pressure in the circuit increased. The characteristics of the expiratory valve approached those of a threshold resistor. Small fluctuations in airway pressure occurred at all settings of CPAP and decreased with the increasing compliance of the circuit at higher values of CPAP. The method provided to monitor the airway pressure was inaccurate and overestimated the true pressure by 20% at pressures greater than 1 kPa.\r"

They were assessed at 5-16 days and again at 27-62 days after treatment.

Favourable clinical responses were obtained in 99% of the fluconazole group and in 97% of the clotrimazole group at the short-term assessment and in 93% and 84% respectively at the long-term assessment when there was a significant advantage for fluconazole treatment (P = 0.02). Symptoms in patients receiving fluconazole were relieved more rapidly (P less than 0.001). Treatment-related side-effects were few and minor in both groups.

We have made use of Northern blot hybridization and specific bioassays to study the effects of the T cell product interleukin-4 (IL-4) on monocyte CSF expression. The results suggest a previously unrecognized role of IL-4 as a CSF inducer since exposure of monocytes to IL-4 resulted in accumulation of transcripts for granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) and macrophage-CSF (M-CSF). Consequently, IL-4-activated monocytes released factors in their culture supernatants biologically and antigenically indistinguishable from G- and M-CSF.\r"

  ".W": "The localization of three known alpha-granule proteins, thrombospondin (TSP), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and fibrinogen (Fg) has been studied in human megakaryocytes (MK) by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. For this study, highly purified populations of MK were prepared from human bone marrow either by counterflow centrifugal elutriation or by cell culture from normal subjects and from two patients with megakaryoblastic leukemia. In normal bone marrow immature MK, TSP, and vWF were observed in the Golgi-associated vesicles and in small immature alpha-granules; in mature MK, they were found in the matrix of the mature large alpha-granules. Surprisingly, Fg was detected neither in the Golgi area, nor in the small precursors of alpha-granules; it was only found in the mature alpha-granules but this labeling was generally weaker than in blood platelets. In order to confirm these differences between the expression of Fg and vWF or TSP additional studies were performed on cultured maturing MK: immunofluorescent and ultrastructural immunogold labeling confirmed that vWF appeared early in the maturation while the same immature MK were negative for Fg. In the late maturation stage, the three proteins were detected in the alpha-granules. In order to know whether Fg was lately synthesized or endocytosed from the outside medium, normal MK were grown in the presence of either normal or afibrinogenemic plasma, and normal serum. Fg was detected only in the alpha-granules of MK grown in normal plasma. Similar results were observed with malignant MK, whose maturation was independent of the culture conditions. In conclusion, this study brings immunocytochemical evidence that vWF and TSP are synthesized by immature MK, whereas Fg appears later in the MK alpha-granules and its expression is dependent of the presence of an exogenous Fg source.\r"

  ".W": "The human genes for the hematopoietic growth factors interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have been mapped to 5q23-31. We present in situ hybridization evidence that the human IL-4 gene is located at 5q23.3-31.2, suggesting that the four cytokine genes may be closely linked. We used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to prepare subchromosomal restriction maps surrounding these genes to define this possible linkage more precisely. The IL-4 and IL-5 genes are tightly linked, being 90 to 240 kilobases (kb) apart, as has been shown for the IL-3 and GM-CSF genes, which are only 9 kb apart. Possible overlap of the map containing the IL-4 and IL-5 genes with restriction sites 5' to the IL-3 gene suggests that the four cytokine genes may be localized within 500 kb of each other. The endothelial cell growth factor gene (ECGF), which has also been localized to the 5q31 region, did not appear to be close to the cytokine genes. Linkage of the IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and GM-CSF genes has important implications in the evolutionary origin and regulation of expression of these genes. The four cytokine genes are located in the region of the long arm of chromosome 5, which is deleted in the 5q- anomaly. The present study provides a basis for further investigations of this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the defective erythropoiesis in eight patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia, we studied their bone marrow response in vitro to recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) and recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In an erythropoietin-containing assay system, specimens from six of the eight patients yielded low numbers of erythroid colonies compared to control values, and in five of these no erythropoietin dose-response could be elicited. Addition of IL-3, GM-CSF or both to cultures from the six patients had no effect on CFU-E-derived colonies. In contrast, IL-3 but not GM-CSF induced a marked increase in the number (183%) and size of the BFU-E-derived colonies in five of the six cases and partially corrected the impaired dose-response to erythropoietin in four. Bone marrow from the other two patients yielded numbers of CFU-E and BFU-E colonies comparable to controls and manifested similar increments in colonies with increasing concentrations of erythropoietin. When IL-3 was added to these cultures, further increments were observed in the number and size of BFU-E colonies. We conclude that IL-3 enhanced the marrow erythropoiesis in most of the patients and exerted a corrective effect on the aberrant colony formation in the presence of erythropoietin. The data raise the possibility of IL-3 as a therapeutic agent in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.\r"

The electrophoretic pattern of hemoglobin was used as a marker of the reconstitution; 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), an X chromosome-linked enzyme was used as a tool for estimating clonality. We injected 10(5) bone marrow cells of 5-FU treated C57BL/6-Pgk-1b/Pgk-1a female mice, in which each stem cell had either A-type PGK or B-type PGK due to random inactivation of one of two X chromosomes, into genetically anemic (WB x C57BL/6)F1-W/Wv (hereafter WBB6F1-W/Wv) mice that contained only B-type PGK. The recipient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice, in which erythropoiesis was reconstituted with donor cells for a long term, were killed and the PGK patterns of bone marrows, thymus, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches were examined. A considerable amount of A-type PGK was detected in the lymphoid organs of the WBB6F1-W/Wv mice in which erythrocytes showed only A-type PGK when killed. In contrast, A-type PGK was scarcely detectable in the lymphoid organs of the WBB6F1-W/Wv mice in which erythrocytes showed only B-type PGK when killed. The present results suggest that the hematopoietic stem cells estimated by the erythropoiesis reconstituting assay differentiate into lymphoid lineage and that the long-term erythropoiesis reconstitution assay is useful for detecting the true primitive hematopoietic stem cells.\r"

  ".W": "To gain insight into the mechanisms involved in regulating murine interleukin-3 (mIL-3) receptor expression, we have examined the effects of mIL-3 and murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (mGM-CSF) on mIL-3 receptor internalization and re-expression and studied the relationship between mIL-3 cell surface receptor density and growth factor sensitivity. As a source of cells for our studies, we used a B6SUtA clone, B6SUtA1, which grows equally well in mIL-3 or mGM-CSF when supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS) in RPMI 1640. Intracellular processing studies carried out in the presence and absence of methylamine suggested that mIL-3 is cleaved at two specific sites before its complete digestion within lysosomes. However, unlike its ligand, cycloheximide studies indicated that internalized mIL-3 receptors are recycled to the cell surface. When B6SUtA1 cells were continuously passaged in mIL-3, cell populations allowed to exhaust the mIL-3 in the medium (high density cells) expressed more than ten times (ie, approximately 100,000/cell) the mIL-3 receptor number of those growing exponentially at low cell concentrations (low density cells). Since the high density cells were no larger than the low density cells, the marked increase in mIL-3 receptor number per cell reflects a true up-regulation of receptor expression. A kinetic analysis of this up-regulation revealed that it begins within one hour of mIL-3 exhaustion. Moreover, proliferation assays with these two cell populations, using 3H-thymidine incorporation, suggested that the high density cells were 30-fold more responsive to mIL-3. However, when B6SUtA1 cells were passaged in mGM-CSF, there was no difference in mIL-3 receptor number between high density and low density cells (ie, approximately 100,000/cell). Identical studies carried out with another mIL-3 dependent cell line, 32D C3, demonstrated that this phenomenon was not unique to B6SUtA1 cells.\r"

  ".U": "89194363\r", 
  ".W": "Human cord blood progenitor-derived erythroblasts have recently been shown to respond to erythropoietin (Epo) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) with a transient increase in intracellular free calcium concentration [Cac]. However, the importance of [Cac] changes in mediating cell proliferation and/or differentiation is undefined. In the present study, the response of erythroid precursors at different stages of differentiation to Epo was examined. Erythroblasts were derived from adult blood erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) at day 7 or day 10 of culture. [Cac] was measured in individual Fura-2 loaded cells with fluorescence microscopy coupled digital video imaging. The dynamic range (Rmax/Rmin) of intracellular Fura-2 was similar to that measured in free solution, suggesting insignificant amounts of intracellular Ca insensitive forms of Fura-2. Baseline [Cac] of erythroid cells calculated with an in vitro calibration method was 44 +/- 4 nmol/L and with an in vivo method was 46 +/- 4 nmol/L. Treatment of day 7 BFU-E derived erythroblasts with Epo resulted in no significant increase in [Cac]. In contrast, in more mature erythroblasts (day 10 of culture), Epo stimulated a large increase in [Cac] from 49 +/- 11 nmol/L at baseline to 279 +/- 47 nmol/L. This [Cac] increase occurred in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing no added calcium. The increase in [Cac] persisted for 18 minutes and was dose dependent. Day 7 and day 10 control cells treated with either insulin or media showed no significant change in [Cac] during 18 minutes of observation. Our data demonstrate that early (day 7) and late (day 10) erythroblasts display different responses to Epo, at least in terms of intracellular Ca++ fluxes. The differential [Cac] response observed in early and late erythroid precursors to growth factor stimulation suggests that [Cac] may be an important signal in cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The proliferative effects of recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were investigated in semi-solid and liquid cultures of purified CD34+ hematopoietic cells obtained from umbilical cord blood. No important differences in overall cloning efficiencies in response to IL-3 or GM-CSF were observed in semi-solid medium in the presence of erythropoietin (Ep). However, GM-CSF was less effective for the development of erythroid bursts (BFU-E), and only IL-3 was observed to induce significant numbers of mixed-erythroid colonies (E-MIX). Both IL-3 and GM-CSF also induced proliferation of CD34+ in liquid cultures. Proliferative responses to IL-3 were found to be more rapid and stronger than to GM-CSF, although the number of initial responsive cells as judged by autoradiography were comparable. Enhanced proliferation of CD34+ cells both in semi-solid and liquid cultures was obtained in the presence of combinations of IL-3 and GM-CSF. The responses observed were less than additive, with the exception of the development of eosinophil colonies and clusters, where IL-3 and GM-CSF were found to act synergistically. In secondary cultures, proliferative responses to GM-CSF were strongly enhanced by preculture of CD34+ cells in IL-3 for four to 11 days, and to a lesser extent by preculture in GM-CSF. Finally, responses to IL-3 were not affected by preculture of CD34+ cells in the presence of GM-CSF. Our results indicate that there is a wide overlap of cells capable of proliferating either in response to IL-3 or to GM-CSF within the cord blood CD34+ compartment. However, differences in primary proliferation kinetics and increased responsiveness to GM-CSF following preculture suggest the importance of a sequential action of IL-3 and GM-CSF in the expansion of CD34+ cells.\r"

Recombinant B beta chains were expressed within five minutes after induction with IPTG and were soluble in physiologic buffers. The recombinant B beta chains migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at a rate identical to B beta chains from fibrinogen treated with N-glycanase. Recombinant B beta chains were cleaved by thrombin, as demonstrated by the loss of cross-reactivity with a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) specific for the undigested B beta 1-42 fragment. The levels of expression of the B beta chain were much lower than those reported previously for the gamma chain of fibrinogen expressed in a similar vector in E coli. However, these levels are sufficient to allow further characterization of this fibrinogen subunit.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured human monocytes have been shown to be susceptible to lysis by autologous lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. To determine factors that might modulate the sensitivity of monocytes to lysis, we cultured adherent peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3) since these cytokines have been reported to affect both functional and physical characteristics of monocytes. Both recombinant human GM-CSF and IL-3 were found to significantly enhance the susceptibility of monocytes to lysis by LAK cells in a dose-dependent manner, with GM-CSF being slightly more effective. In a kinetics study, the lysability of monocytes increased after two days of incubation with either cytokine, with maximal susceptibility occurring after four to six days of culture. The effects of GM-CSF and IL-3 appeared to be specific for monocytes since culture of either nonadherent cells or granulocytes, which are normally resistant to LAK-mediated lysis, did not induce sensitivity. While the effects of GM-CSF and IL-3 have been shown to be synergistic in some cases, they did not act synergistically to induce monocyte susceptibility to LAK lysis. In cold target experiments cytokine-treated monocytes reciprocally blocked lysis, suggesting that similar target structures were modulated with either factor. FACS analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) demonstrated comparable modulation of surface antigens with either GM-CSF or IL-3. Thus, these cytokines can serve to augment susceptibility of monocytes to LAK cells, emphasizing the complex interactions that occur in the immune system.\r"

These patients had either the characteristic Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) [t(9;22)(q34;q11)] or cytogenetically similar variants with a 22q11 breakpoint but no detectable cytogenetic involvement of 9q34. The findings suggested two distinct subtypes of ALL: one defined by t(9;22)(q34;q11) and expression of P185BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase and one with variant karyotypes and no P185BCR-ABL expression. The former comprises cases with Ph1 + marrow cells and Ph1 + erythroid and (or) myeloid colonies in remission marrow and others in which the t(9;22) is undetectable in remission marrow cells. In the latter subgroup, the disease may reflect more extreme mosaicism with a similar stem cell that is cytogenetically undetectable. Variant karyotypes included a del(22)(q11) in one patient and a t(6;22;15;9) (q21;q11;q?22;q21) in another; in both instances, the malignant blast cells lacked P185BCR-ABL expression. Thus ALL with t(9;22)(q34;q11) should be distinguished from ALL with other involvement of the 22q11 breakpoint by molecular studies including protein expression. The diversity of karyotypic findings in cases with involvement of 22q11 suggests at least two mechanisms of leukemogenesis in patients with ALL defined by this breakpoint.\r"

To model this in vitro, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-activated PMN were exposed to shear stress on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and on plastic dishes coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA). PMN adhesion to HUVECs averaged 36% of the total PMNs added and was reduced to 21% by shear stress of approximately 1.5 dynes.cm-2. On BSA, adhesion was reduced from 59% to 35%. Dextran sulfate (molecular weight 500,000) inhibited PMN adhesion in a dose-dependent manner when shear stress was applied. At a concentration of 1 mg.ml-1, inhibition was 72% on HUVECs and 76% on BSA. Half-maximal inhibition was reached at approximately 1 microgram.mL-1 dextran sulfate, corresponding to 2 nmol/L. Without shear stress, dextran sulfate had no effect on HUVECs and only a moderate effect on BSA. The murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 60.3, recognizing an epitope on the leukocyte adhesion glycoprotein CD18, inhibited PMN adhesion equally well with and without shear. A low dose of MoAb 60.3 enhanced the effect of dextran sulfate without shear stress. Flow cytometry (FACS) did not show inhibition of MoAb 60.3 binding to PMNs by dextran sulfate. These results indicate that a dextran sulfate-inhibitable adhesion process is important for PMN adhesion in the presence of shear stress.\r"

  ".W": "The reconstitution of hematopoietic cells and in vitro assays of immunologic function have been followed in leukemic patients after conventional bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (N = 34) and T-cell depleted BMT (N = 52) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donors. No effects of the T-cell depletion could be seen on the recovery of myeloid or lymphoid cells as measured by the day to engraftment or by the absolute number of cells through day 100. Normal numbers of lytically active natural killer cells returned the earliest and were rapidly followed in both groups of patients by the appearance of circulating B cells and normalization of the responses to B-cell mitogens. However, the recovery of normal T-cell proliferative responses were more delayed in recipients of T-cell depleted grafts. Significant quantitative differences were seen only during the first 3 months after transplantation. Neither the number of CD3+ T cells nor the ratio of CD4:CD8 positive cells differed markedly between the two transplant groups. Mitogen-induced immunoglobulin production by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients following T-cell depleted BMT was quantitatively less than that of conventional marrow recipients through the first year, with low normal IgM production reached by 4 to 6 months in both groups. IgG production reached low normal 7 to 9 months after conventional BMT but did not remain at this level until 1 year following either type of transplant. Assessment of the incidence of infections from the day the absolute neutrophil count reached 500 until day 180 after transplant revealed no significant differences between the two groups; indeed, the overall nonleukemic mortality was higher in the recipients of conventional bone marrow. Thus, in our series, the removal of mature cells from the marrow graft did not affect the rate or degree of recovery of myeloid and lymphoid cells but did affect the regeneration of in vitro T-cell dependent functions. We noted early quantitative differences and a delay in the normalization of the T-cell functions measured rather than prolonged absolute deficiencies. The in vitro deficiencies did not result in significant clinically apparent differences between the two groups.\r"

  ".W": "The lymphocyte cell surface molecule CD5 (T1, Leu 1, Tp67 in the human; Ly 1 in the mouse) is expressed on the majority of circulating T lymphocytes and a small population of B cells. We have analyzed CD5 expression on repopulating T cells in the peripheral blood of patients after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The frequency of CD3+ T cells that lack expression of CD5 is dramatically increased after BMT compared with the normal population. The percent of total CD3+ CD5- cells correlated with the presence of graft versus host disease and with time following transplant, but did not correlate with age, diagnosis, preparative regimen, T-cell depletion of the marrow, major histocompatibility complex compatibility, or the presence or absence of interstitial pneumonitis. Furthermore, the total number and percent of CD8+ CD5- cells was increased following BMT. CD3+ cells from BMT patients were sorted for the presence or absence of CD5 expression. CD3+ CD5- cells were capable of interleukin-2 production and of mediating cytolysis following lectin stimulation. We conclude that CD3+ CD5- T cells are functional and represent a significant proportion of circulating cells in patients after BMT.\r"

  ".W": "Using red cell phenotyping, cytogenetic analysis of blood lymphocytes, chromosome studies of bone marrow cells, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) studies of peripheral blood cells, we demonstrated a high number of mixed chimeras after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Donor marrow from HLA-A, -B, and -DR identical, mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) nonreactive siblings was depleted of 98% of lymphocytes using counterflow centrifugation. Thirty-two of 48 recipients (67%) appeared to be mixed chimeras at 6 months after transplantation. The high number of mixed chimeras is probably a result of lymphocyte depletion of the marrow graft and the high sensitivity of red cell phenotyping for the demonstration of minor cell populations (at levels as low as 0.01%). The probability of relapse-free survival from 6 months to 4 years after BMT was 85% for the mixed chimeras and 65% for the complete donor chimeras. We conclude that in this study, mixed chimerism is not associated with a higher incidence of relapse.\r"

Successful RBC and WBC replacement, based on blood cell parameters and donor genetic markers, were observed in all combinations of transplant therapy. Nevertheless, the an/an mice died prematurely several months after treatment, whether they received +/+ or an/an marrow cells. In contrast, the +/+ recipients of either +/+ or an/an marrow cells survived for at least 1 year after transplantation. Premature death of the an/an mice was associated with lymphopenia, anemia, kidney lesions, and severe pathogen-free pneumonitis. On the basis of our results, we hypothesize that the premature deaths of an/an mice are caused by a kind of chronic irradiation damage to which an/an mice are especially susceptible.\r"

  ".W": "In an ongoing study of the changes that occur in platelet concentrates during storage, we investigated two 28-26-Kd proteins designated SP-1 and SP-2, respectively, which increase markedly during blood-bank storage of platelet concentrates at room temperature. Formation of SP-1 and SP-2 was inhibited by storage at 4 degrees C as well as by treatment of the concentrates with leupeptin, N-ethylmaleimide, and EDTA; DFP and PPACK had no effect. The calcium ionophore A23187 markedly stimulated production of SP-1 and SP-2. After partial purification, the two proteins were found to be associated with platelet cytoskeletal protein. Two-dimensional peptide mapping and amino acid sequencing identified SP-1 and SP-2 as fragments of actin formed by cleavage on the N-terminal side of residues Thr-106 and Ala-114, respectively. Generation of SP-1 and SP-2 during storage of platelet concentrate is likely attributable to calcium-dependent neutral protease degradation of actin and may have implications for development of the platelet storage lesion.\r"

The clinician discusses the printout and proposed investigations with the patient. The system has been tested against experienced clinicians and the results are presented. The computer system was evaluated for 26 patients and was found to record all of the important information. The system is now in regular use in the out-patient clinic as the first part of the diagnostic work-up in suitable referrals. This system has shortened waiting times for first appointments. To date 261 patients have used the system. The consultant urologist continues his practice of reading all referral letters and allocating priorities.

In malignant epithelium, more than 90% of cells bound UEA1, irrespective of whether FFPE or cryostat sections were used. Lipid solvents are required for FFPE (but not cryostat) processing and may cause glycolipid extraction. Glycoproteins are not affected. These results suggest that the UEA1 binding site is predominantly glycolipid-based in benign prostatic epithelium but, following malignant transformation, becomes predominantly glycoprotein-based.\r"

A randomised prospective study of oestrogen therapy versus orchiectomy was performed. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular morbidity were excluded (16%). Prior to the initiation of therapy, patients were subjected to exercise stress tests, physiological evaluation of peripheral circulation, blood volume estimation, chest X-ray, blood test, including hormones, lipoproteins, and antithrombin III, and a physical examination and history by a cardiologist. The oestrogen treatment and the orchiectomy group did not differ with regard to these pretreatment variables; 25% of the patients given oestrogen therapy had cardiovascular complications during the initial treatment year compared with none in the orchiectomy group. Three statistical discriminating techniques were employed and they allowed us to identify 2 strong discriminating variables for cardiovascular complications if oestrogen therapy is instituted in patients with prostatic cancer but without overt clinical cardiovascular disease. These 2 discriminators were luteinising hormone (LH) and ST-segment depression during exercise. This means that a patient with ST-segment depression during an exercise test and/or a high luteinising hormone concentration should not be treated with oestrogen.\r"

  ".W": "In a series of patients with acute pancreatitis we have studied complement factors, antiproteases (alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 1-antiprotease) and C-reactive protein to determine the value of their sequential measurement in the prediction of outcome relative to clinical assessment and current multiple factor scoring systems. Complement factors were unhelpful in predicting the severity of an attack. alpha 2-Macroglobulin levels were significantly lower in complicated attacks during days 3-8 and alpha 1-antiprotease levels were significantly higher during days 4-8. C-reactive protein concentrations showed the best discrimination between mild and complicated attacks, levels rising higher and persisting for longer in complicated attacks; these differences were highly significant from day 2 (the morning after admission) to day 8. The concentrations providing the best discrimination were found to be greater than or equal to 210 mg/l for the peak C-reactive protein (on the second, third or fourth day) and greater than or equal to 120 mg/l for the C-reactive protein at the end of the first week. Analysis demonstrated both the peak or seventh-day C-reactive protein concentration to be of similar accuracy to either the Ranson or Glasgow multiple factor scoring systems and slightly better for attacks associated with gallstones. The C-reactive protein assay is simple, quick to perform, provides useful clinical information and is more likely to be of value and to be adopted into routine clinical practice than multiple factor scoring systems.\r"

Analyses were performed for reported maternal use of medications and drugs in the year preceding and during the index pregnancy of the 204 case-control pairs. An 11-fold risk (P = 0.003) was found for maternal use of mind-altering drugs just prior to or during the index pregnancy. Compared with ANLL cases not exposed to marijuana, exposed cases were significantly younger at diagnosis of ANLL (P less than 0.01) and were more often of the myelomonocytic and monocytic subtypes (P less than 0.01). Use of antinausea medication for more than 11 weeks was also associated with a significantly elevated relative risk of 2.81 and a dose-response relationship was noted (P = 0.05 for trend). These results suggest that maternal drug use of marijuana may have an etiologic role in childhood ANLL and may be specific for morphologically defined subgroups.\r"

  ".W": "Seven children with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma younger than 20 years of age diagnosed between 1975 and 1986 (inclusive) were treated with a uniform adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, which consisted of vincristine (1.5 mg/m2; day 1), doxorubicin (45 mg/m2; day 1), 5-fluorouracil (8 mg/kg; days 1 through 5), and cyclophosphamide (7 mg/kg; days 1 through 5). This combination chemotherapy was given for 12 to 24 months after completion of radiation therapy. The radiation doses to the primary sites ranged from 6000 cGy to a maximum of 6800 cGy. The radiation doses for neck prophylaxis ranged from 4500 cGy to a total of 5000 cGy. Involved sites were irradiated to at least an additional boost of 1000 cGy. One patient had an external dose 6000 cGy to the primary site boosted with brachytherapy of 3000 cGy at the surface of an ovoid. After chemotherapy myelosuppression occurred in all patients and was tolerable. All seven patients are surviving, six disease-free, for 22 months to 12 years (median, 4 years). This study suggests that the combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy as used here has acceptable toxicity and is effective and further suggests that children with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, even in its advanced stage at diagnosis, may be curable.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized trial was performed to determine relative efficacy and toxicity of two first-line combination chemotherapy regimens in women with metastatic breast cancer: CFP (cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, prednisone) and CMFP (cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, prednisone). Both regimens have reported efficacy in this setting but differ in dosages and scheduling of the agents they have in common. Three hundred thirty-six women with no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were eligible and evaluable, and 309 had either measurable or evaluable disease and were assessable for objective response. Responses were seen in 65 of 153 (42%) on CFP and 83 of 156 (53%) on CMFP (two-sided P = 0.06). Median durations of response were 7.1 months for CFP and 8.5 months for CMFP (log-rank, two-sided P = 0.67). Considering all 336 patients, the median times to disease progression were 4.7 months for CFP and 6.2 months for CMFP (log-rank P = 0.31) and median survivals were 15.2 and 14.9 months, respectively (log-rank P = 0.88). Covariate analysis did not alter these findings. Median leukocyte nadirs were 1800 for CFP and 1500 for CMFP, with 22% and 21%, respectively, having nadirs less than 1000/microliters. Emesis was more frequent on CFP (49%) than on CMFP (26%) but was severe in only 7% and 5%, respectively. It is concluded that despite a higher response rate on CMFP and some differences in toxicities including a higher reported incidence of emesis on CFP, there was no substantial difference in efficacy or tolerability between the two regimens.\r"

  ".U": "89194994\r", 
  ".W": "Chemotherapeutic regimens for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) include a remission induction period with high, daily doses of prednisone among other agents. A period of central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis follows, during which steroids are often tapered entirely before cranial radiation (CRT) is completed or even initiated. The somnolence syndrome (SS) has been described 4 to 6 weeks after completion of CRT in up to 60% of the children with doses as low as 1800 cGy. A pilot study of continuous steroid coverage during CRT in childhood ALL was conducted. From July 1984 to July 1986, 38 children entered on Children's Cancer Study Group ALL protocols received CRT of 1800 cGy (180 cGy x 10). All patients received oral prednisone throughout the entire course of CRT at daily doses varying from 3.0 to 60.0 mg/m2. The overall incidence of the SS was 13% (five patients). The development of the syndrome was steroid dose-dependent: greater than or equal to 15 mg/m2/d (one of 32 patients), 3% incidence; less than 15 mg/m2 (four of six patients), 67% incidence. The presence of headache during CRT was also steroid dose-related: greater than or equal to 15 mg/m2, one of 32 patients; less than 15 mg/m2, six of six patients. Of the seven patients with headache during CRT, five developed the SS. The two patients (both of the less than 15 mg/m2 group) who did not develop the SS were the only cases treated with increased steroid doses at the onset of headache symptoms. Steroid coverage at a dose of greater than or equal to 15 mg/m2 during CRT appears to significantly reduce the incidence of acute radiation reactions and the SS. A prospective randomized study is planned to confirm these initial findings.\r"

  ".W": "Hodgkin's disease (HD) is sometimes difficult to distinguish from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and a reliable marker for Reed-Sternberg and related (R-S) cells in paraffin sections would be useful. Ninety-one cases of HD with PNA, anti-Leu M1, and LN-2, and 90 cases with Ber-H2 were studied. The staining results were evaluated independently. R-S cells stained positively with one or more of the reagents in all cases. PNA staining was positive in 78 cases (85.7%); Leu M1, 63 (69.2%); LN-2, 71 (78.0%); and Ber-H2, 80 cases (88.9%). Positively stained cells were readily recognized in 71 cases (91.0%) of PNA+, 51 (80.9%) of Leu M1+, and 51 (71.8%) of LN-2+ and 71 (88.7%) of Ber-H2+ cases; the cells were found only after careful search in the remaining cases. Sixteen cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (large cell type, ten; mixed, five; unclassifiable, one) were also stained. Tumor cells did not stain with PNA or anti-Leu M1 in any of the 16 cases but did stain positively with LN-2 in four and with Ber-H2 in five. Thus, the detection rate of R-S cells was the highest with Ber-H2, closely followed by PNA. PNA, however, stained the largest number of R-S cells per case, and the results were least affected by the type of fixative employed. Staining of peripheral T-cell lymphoma appeared to be nil or extremely rare with PNA and Leu M1, whereas it was not uncommon with Ber-H2 and LN-2. In conclusion, to facilitate the detection of R-S cells in paraffin sections, the application of a panel of three markers, PNA, Leu M1, and Ber-H2, appears to be necessary at this point in time.\r"

  ".W": "The United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group's malignant germ cell tumor studies were undertaken to establish standard protocols for investigating, staging, and treating children, and to study the efficacy of new drug combinations and the value of serial measurement of serum alphafetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG). Boys with Stage I testicular tumors were treated by orchidectomy alone, whereas, after appropriate surgery, chemotherapy was recommended for children with more advanced testicular tumors or with tumors at other sites. From 1979 to 1987, 126 children aged 0 to younger than 16 years with malignant germ cell tumors were registered. They were similar to patients in other large pediatric series with respect to sites of origin, age at presentation in relationship to primary site, histology, female predominance for sacrococcygeal site, and presence of associated malformations (present in 17%). Serum AFP was measured in 123 patients and was elevated in 115, whereas HCG was raised in 19 of 77. Monitoring by serial AFP measurement proved valuable in assessing response to therapy and in early detection of tumor recurrence. When treatment results were assessed in February 1988, 101 of 122 patients were alive (four who received nonprotocol chemotherapy were excluded). Forty-four patients had been cured by surgery alone (41 with testicular tumors, two with ovarian tumors, and one with sacrococcygeal tumor). All of the remaining 78 children received chemotherapy. The initial low dose vincristine, actinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (LDVAC) regimen proved ineffective, actuarial survival at 5 years followup being 8% (12 patients), and a regimen of cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB) caused unacceptable toxicity, with actuarial survival at 5 years follow-up being 67% (nine patients). Five-year actuarial survival was 87% for 17 children given high dose VAC with or without doxorubicin and 84% for 33 given bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP). All 7 children given various combinations of these regimens survived. Excluding the 12 LDVAC cases, patient survival by site was as follows: testis (59 patients, 100%); vagina, uterus, and prostate (four patients, 100%); ovary (25 patients, 88%); thorax (five patients, 40%), and other (four patients, 67%). Similarly, patient survival by stage was Stage I (62,97%), Stage II (14,86%); Stage III (18,83%); and Stage IV (16,72%). Survival by histology was analysed only in cases for which histologic review had been done the LDVAC cases were excluded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The growth stimulation was specifically inhibited by antibodies versus Gastrin Releasing Peptide (GRP) crossreacting with BMBS. Presence of BMBS-positive neuroendocrine cells in human prostate and measurable amounts of BMBS-like peptides in prostatic fluid were reported previously. In a binding assay using 125I-GRP, it was possible to demonstrate the presence of saturable specific receptors on PC3 cells, numerically comparable with those measured on small cell lung cancer cell lines. By immunofluorescence, however, no BMBS immunoreactivity on PC3 cells could be demonstrated. These observations suggest that BMBS plays a role in prostatic epithelium growth and that prostatic carcinoma may have an autocrine or paracrine proliferation stimulus within the gland microenvironment.\r"

Eight tumors stained for vimentin, eight for desmin, eight for neuron-specific enolase, two for muscle-specific actin, and one for fast myosin. No reactivity was detected with the other antibodies. Electron microscopic study showed a consistent pattern of fine structure and clarified the mode of formation of the distinctive cytoplasmic crystals which were detected in all 14 tumors. Intermediate filaments were sparse and specific myofilaments were not detected. Alveolar soft part sarcoma has a myogenic phenotype and the cells show skeletal muscle differentiation but do not closely resemble any known prototypic normal cell.\r"

The staining was scored (histoscore) by estimates of relative nuclear staining intensity and the percentage of positively stained carcinoma cells. Of the invasive ductal carcinomas 72% were ER-positive and 55% were PR-positive. The invasive lobular, intraductal, tubular, and mucinous carcinomas were the most frequent ER-positive tumor types, whereas comedo and medullary carcinomas only rarely contained ER. Progesterone receptor was most frequently present in intraductal, tubular, and mucinous carcinomas. Better differentiated tumors with lower histologic grade were significantly associated with high prevalence of immunohistochemically determined ER and PR (P less than 0.0001). Proliferative cell fraction, determined by DNA flow cytometric study (n = 63), was inversely related to ER (P = 0.03) and PR (P = 0.05) status. Aneuploidy was independent of ER or PR content.\r"

The authors report seven cases from the files of The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. Each presented clinically as a palpable thyroid nodule months or years after the primary renal cell carcinoma had been resected. Although renal cell carcinoma is more common in men, we found a female predominance of 6:1 in this series. These lesions appear as solitary \"cold\" nodules on iodine 131 scans and may be misdiagnosed as primary thyroid neoplasms, especially if the renal primary is still unrecognized. A correct diagnosis is important because surgical management can be curative. The diagnosis is facilitated by the use of fat stains, electron microscopic study, and immunoperoxidase stains.\r"

  ".W": "Acute hypertension disrupts the blood-brain barrier and may neutralize the negative charge on cerebral endothelium. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of molecular charge on permeability of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension. Intravital fluorescent microscopy and fluorescein-labeled dextrans were used to evaluate disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension in rats. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier was quantitated by calculating clearance of neutral dextran and of anionic dextran sulfate in two groups of rats. Pressure in pial venules, which are the primary site of disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension, was measured using a servo-null device. When systemic arterial pressure was increased from 87 +/- 5 (mean +/- SEM) to 188 +/- 5 mm Hg, clearance of neutral dextran increased from 0.04 +/- 0.01 to 4.38 +/- 0.72 ml/sec x 10(-6). When systemic arterial pressure was increased from 91 +/- 4 to 181 +/- 3 mm Hg, clearance of anionic dextran sulfate increased from 0.02 +/- 0.01 to only 0.70 +/- 0.23 ml/sec x 10(-6). Increases in pial venular pressure were similar in the two groups. Thus, similar increases in systemic arterial pressure and pial venular pressure during acute hypertension produce less disruption of the blood-brain barrier to anionic dextran sulfate than neutral dextran. The findings suggest that 1) the net negative charge of cerebral vessels may be preserved during acute hypertension, and 2) molecular charge is an important determinant of the severity of disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension.\r"

  ".U": "89195619\r", 
  ".W": "It has been shown previously that serotonin stimulates the production of prostacyclin by bovine aortic smooth muscle cells in culture, via 5-HT2 receptors (Coughlin SR, Moskowitz MA, Antoniades HN, Levine L. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1981;78:7134-7138). These cells express a synthetic phenotype, whereas the majority of the smooth muscle cells in the media from adult arteries are in a contractile state. We have now compared 5-HT stimulated prostacyclin production in bovine aortic media explants, a preparation of contractile smooth muscle, with cultured smooth muscle cells derived from the explants. In the 1-10 microM range, serotonin stimulates the release of prostacyclin from the explants of bovine aortic media, cultured for a short period. In the presence of cocaine (30 microM), 1 microM was sufficient to produce a maximal effect. The stimulatory action of serotonin was sustained with time and did not induce a lasting desensitization. The effect of serotonin on the explants was inhibited only partially (+/- 30%) by ketanserin, a selective and potent 5-HT2 antagonist. It was mimicked by 5-carboxamido-tryptamine, a 5-HT1 agonist, but was only weakly inhibited by methiothepin, a 5-HT1 antagonist. As expected, in cultured smooth muscle cells, 5-carboxamido-tryptamine was only a weak agonist in stimulating prostacyclin production. In conclusion, it appears that the serotonin effect on prostacyclin production is mediated by different receptors in media explants from bovine aortic media and cultured cells obtained by outgrowth from these explants: a 5-HT2 receptor in the smooth muscle cells in culture and a receptor presenting some similarities with 5-HT1 receptors in the explants.\r"

In less typical cases, however, this distinction can be difficult. An adolescent male presented with a swollen, tender thyroid gland. Atypical laboratory findings and the lack of fever and toxicity delayed the diagnosis and treatment of acute suppurative thyroiditis. A review of the pediatric literature summarizes clinical and diagnostic features valuable in the differential between acute suppurative thyroiditis and subacute thyroiditis in childhood. The important contribution of fistulae between the piriform sinus and thyroid gland to the pathogenesis and acute suppurative thyroiditis is emphasized. Such a fistula should be sought in every patient in whom this entity is diagnosed.\r"

To evaluate the effect of this drug on the release of glucoregulatory hormones during hypoglycemia, we studied the responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia (0.1 units/kg) in 10 patients with mild essential hypertension before and after treatment for 16 weeks with transdermal clonidine. Clonidine significantly lowered blood pressure, basal plasma norepinephrine levels, and epinephrine and renin activity but did not affect basal growth hormone concentrations. Clonidine significantly reduced the norepinephrine and epinephrine responses to hypoglycemia (norepinephrine AUC from 207 +/- 16 SE to 156 +/- 25 nmol/L/min, epinephrine from 157 +/- 28 to 99 +/- 29 nmol/L/min; both p less than 0.05) and increased the growth hormone response (AUC from 763 +/- 148 ng/min/ml to 1164 +/- 292 ng/min/ml; p less than 0.05) but did not affect the cortisol response or the magnitude or rate of glucose recovery from hypoglycemia.

After 4 weeks of therapy and at the end of the dosing interval, nicardipine reduced arterial pressure by 10/6 mm Hg and 12/6 mm Hg in the supine and standing positions, respectively (all p less than 0.01). In the hydrochlorothiazide group, the reductions were 12/6 mm Hg and 14/6 mm Hg, respectively (all p less than 0.01). The maximum reduction in blood pressure of 16/14 mm Hg supine and 20/15 mm Hg standing occurred within 1 hour after administration of nicardipine. The mean reduction in the hydrochlorothiazide group after 1 hour was 14/11 mm Hg supine and 16/12 mm Hg standing. Neither drug affected autonomic reflexes associated with maximum exercise. Nicardipine increased urinary sodium excretion during the 4-hour period after the first dose. Adverse effects of nicardipine were primarily extensions of its vasodilator effect and included flushing, headache, and edema.\r"

Intraoperative/autopsy findings or clinical course categorized patients as having severe (n = 16) or mild (n = 28) pancreatitis. The frequency of 88 early available variables was analyzed. Twenty significant differences were found and used to program a Bayesian prediction of severity, assuming their independence. The computer's performance was assessed by retrospective testing of the patients, and a further 47 (14 severe, 33 mild) were studied prospectively, with a comparison carried out involving the unaided prediction of the clinicians. Finally, all 91 patients were retrospectively tested with the early predictive Ranson's signs and the results were compared with the computer's output. In the prospective evaluation, the computer's performance was 89.4% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, 84.8% specificity, while that of the physicians was 65.9%, 71.4%, 63.6%, respectively, like the performances of Ranson's criteria. Methodologic problems were: selecting patients to study, based on wide inclusion and exclusion in hindsight of the false-positives; dividing them into groups, based on both pathologic and clinical criteria; and the assumption of independence within the variables. The use of the procedure in other populations requires a specific analysis of the discriminant variables, but this study suggests a method to compare several samples of patients which allows prospective and controlled clinical trials.\r"

Despite these beneficial effects, PEEP may adversely affect cardiac output, thus reducing oxygen delivery. To monitor some of the cardiopulmonary effects of PEEP, we utilized a noninvasive rebreathing technique to measure effective (nonshunted) pulmonary blood flow (Qepr) and compared the results to those measured by thermodilution (Qepi) in normal and oleic acid-injured canine lungs. Qepr was highly correlated with Qepi (r = .92, r2 = .85, p less than .001) despite large variations in PEEP before lung injury (0 to 15 cm H2O) and after lung injury (0 to 20 cm H2O). This close correlation was found even with wide ranges in cardiac output (1.01 to 6.45 L/min) and intrapulmonary shunt fractions (0.03 to 0.67). This technique may prove valuable as a noninvasive method by which to monitor and adjust PEEP therapy in patients with acute lung injury.\r"

Patients were seen monthly and crossed over after 5 mo of treatment. Control as assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin (NPH 9.2 +/- 0.1%, lente 9.3 +/- 0.1%, mean +/- SE) and fructosamine (1.55 +/- 0.02 and 1.57 +/- 0.02 mM) concentrations was identical for the two regimens as were home-collected laboratory-measured fasting blood glucose (BG) (NPH 8.8 +/- 0.5 mM, lente 9.0 +/- 0.5 mM) and mean BG (8.2 +/- 0.3 and 7.6 +/- 0.3 mM) concentrations. For both regimens, the major control problem was the BG concentration before and after breakfast. Total insulin dosage was similar (NPH 56.3 +/- 0.6 U/day, lente 57.2 +/- 0.6 U/day) with no tendency for a difference in the evening intermediate-acting dose (NPH 17.0 +/- 0.3 U/day, lente 17.0 +/- 0.3 U/day) to counter fasting hyperglycemia. Serum lipid concentrations and body weight confirmed the equivalence of control. Hypoglycemic events were recorded in personal diaries and graded by predetermined criteria. Self-treated, relative-assisted, and hospital/doctor-treated hypoglycemic events did not differ in frequency. We conclude that lente- and NPH-based twice-daily human insulin regimens give indistinguishable metabolic control.\r"

Taken together with the lack of markers for an autoimmune process, these findings suggest that diabetes mellitus in this syndrome results from genetically programmed selective beta-cell death.\r"

We present a new method of achieving a reliable and unbiased clamp using an iterative computer program. After initial parameter estimation, the program uses no fixed algorithm or physiological preconceptions but makes predictions according to previous glycemic responses to infusion rates. The program can be used for human or animal studies and for euglycemic or hyperglycemic clamps. The program has flexible data entry, graphic display, running statistics of mean infusion data, and mean glucose levels and their standard deviations. These form part of the criteria for the assessment of glucose clamping, which includes the sampling interval, the duration of the clamp, the achieved glucose concentration (together with its coefficient of variation), and the percent change of glucose infused at the end of the clamp. Data for 151 consecutive clamp studies were analyzed. Median coefficient of variation of glucose values at the end of the clamp was 2%.\r"

Altogether, 75 men and 79 women from East Finland and 83 men and 62 women from West Finland aged 45-64 yr were studied. Of these patients, 44.4% had undetectable fasting and 38.5% undetectable postglucagon C-peptide concentrations. The phi-coefficient expressing the concordance of fasting and postglucagon C-peptide concentrations in the classification of diabetic patients into nonresponders and responders was .75 in men and .91 in women. In multiple stepwise regression analyses, body mass index (BMI) and the period between diabetes diagnosis and the initiation of insulin treatment were positively and duration of diabetes inversely associated with fasting and postglucagon C-peptide levels in both sexes. We concluded that 1) insulin deficiency is not uncommon in middle-aged insulin-treated diabetic patients whose diabetes has been diagnosed after the age of 30 yr; 2) fasting C-peptide levels contain basically the same information as postglucagon C-peptide levels; and 3) a low BMI, a need for insulin treatment soon after the diagnosis of diabetes, and a long duration of diabetes are predictive of insulin deficiency.\r"

To prevent this predictable increase in blood glucose levels, we randomly assigned young adolescents with IDDM to an intervention based on problem solving with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) integrated into standard outpatient care or to standard care only for an 18-mo period. At follow-up, 50% of the standard-care adolescents exhibited greater than 1% increase in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) levels over baseline values, indicating a deterioration in metabolic control, compared to only 23% of the intervention group. Follow-up HbA1 means +/- SD were 10.10 +/- 2.00% for intervention and 11.04 +/- 2.28% for standard-care adolescents, indicating a significantly lower value in the intervention group (P = .04). At follow-up, a greater percentage of intervention than standard-care adolescents reported using SMBG information when they exercised (60.0 vs. 33.3%, chi 2 = 4.29, P = .04). Our data suggest that clinic-based problem-solving groups can be more effective with young adolescents with IDDM than conventional treatment in preventing the expected deterioration in blood glucose.\r"

Improved glycemic control resulting from use of sophisticated insulin delivery and monitoring systems has also led to the recognition of recurrent hypoglycemia as a potential major clinical and occupational hazard. No data concerning the occupational safety of individuals with insulin-treated diabetes mellitus (ITDM) are available. We review the literature on diabetic drivers in an effort to examine the impact of certification of ITDMs as commercial drivers. In the absence of significant worldwide experience with ITDMs as commercial drivers, the discussion is necessarily based on projected accident rates derived from data on frequency of hypoglycemia. These studies are universally flawed by variable definitions of hypoglycemia, ascertainment bias, and patient selection. They do, however, provide a worst-case/best-case scenario for discussion. It is imperative that any expansion of employment opportunities for ITDMs be followed carefully with prospective studies to assess the impact on public safety.\r"

  ".W": "Despite comparable rates of hemolysis, only 50% of patients with sickle hemoglobinopathy (SH) develop pigment gallstones by age 20 yr. Thus, pathogenetic factors, other than hemolysis, may contribute to gallstone formation. In the present study we determined whether gallbladder function, measured by real-time ultrasonography or bile acid metabolism, determined by isotope dilution-mass spectrometry, were altered in adolescents and young adults with SH. Compared with healthy controls, SH subjects had larger fasting (27 +/- 16 vs. 15 +/- 5 ml, p less than 0.02), and residual (8 +/- 6 vs. 4 +/- 2 ml, p less than 0.03) volumes of the gallbladder, but similar rates of emptying (0.029 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.034 +/- 0.029 min-1) and percentage of fasting volume emptied (71% +/- 13% vs. 72% +/- 14%). In SH subjects, the volume and emptying of the gallbladder were similar between those with and without gallstones. Some SH subjects had stasis of bile within the gallbladder, as demonstrated by isotopic disequilibrium between the circulating bile acid pool and bile stored in the gallbladder. Subjects with SH with gallstones tended to have smaller bile acid pools than SH subjects without gallstones (81 +/- 11 vs 163 +/- 91 mumol/kg, p = 0.051). We conclude that adolescents and young adults with SH have enlarged gallbladders that retain an increased postprandial volume of bile. Bile retention within the gallbladder may lead to stasis and contribute to the pathogenesis of pigment gallstones.\r"

One hundred millilitres of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid was infused onto the ulcer craters or scars of 143 duodenal ulcer patients on 168 occasions. Symptomatic patients were randomised to receive 40 mg of hyoscine intravenously before acid infusion, or to a control group. Typical ulcer pain developed in seven of 55 (13%) instances for non-symptomatic patients, 24/57 (42%) of control symptomatic patients, and 20/56 (36%) of symptomatic patients given hyoscine. (Asymptomatic group v control symptomatic group, p less than 0.005; control symptomatic group v hyoscine group, NS - 95% confidence limits 12% in favour of the control and 24% in favour of the hyoscine group). The results suggest that acid infusion seldom reproduces ulcer pain in non-symptomatic duodenal ulcer patients and that the pathogenesis of acid induced duodenal ulcer pain probably involves a mechanism other than spasm, as pain was not prevented by an anticholinergic.\r"

Of the nine laboratory tests compared, the white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and urea concentrations were significantly lower in the somatostatin group two days after admission. Severity of pancreatitis after hospitalisation increased in fewer patients given somatostatin (NS). There was a trend toward fewer complications, especially local, in the somatostatin group. Mortality in both groups was low. Somatostatin appeared to reduce the local complications of acute pancreatitis. A larger trial is necessary to show its beneficial effect conclusively.\r"

In a prospective study of CMV infection in bone marrow transplant recipients, the PCR assay correctly identified four patients with confirmed CMV infection.

Results: Upper body obese women had greater (P less than 0.005) basal palmitate turnover than lower body obese or nonobese women (2.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.2 mumol.kg lean body mass (LBM)-1.min-1, respectively), but a reduced (P less than 0.05) net lipolytic response to epinephrine (59 +/- 7 vs. 79 +/- 5 vs. 81 +/- 7 mumol palmitate/kg LBM, respectively). Both types of obesity were associated with impaired suppression of FFA turnover in response to euglycemic hyperinsulinemia compared to nonobese women (P less than 0.005). These specific differences in FFA metabolism may reflect adipocyte heterogeneity, which may in turn affect the metabolic aberrations associated with different types of obesity. These findings emphasize the need to characterize obese subjects before studies.\r"

Previously, SS-A/Ro has been shown to be composed of at least two polypeptide antigens of 60 and 52 kD noncovalently associated with a set of small RNAs, designated Y1-Y5. A serum from an SS patient was selected to screen a lambda gt11 cDNA library constructed from human T cell lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT-4) mRNA. An immunoreactive clone was isolated that possessed a 1.8-kb cDNA insert. In vitro transcription and translation of the cDNA resulted in the synthesis of a 57.5-kD polypeptide which was specifically immunoprecipitated by SS-A/Ro antisera. The identity of the cDNA encoded protein as the 60-kD SS-A/Ro antigen was established by proteolytic peptide mapping of the cDNA-encoded protein and the 60-kD HeLa cell antigen. The sequence of the cDNA shows that the 60-kD SS-A/Ro protein possesses both RNA binding protein consensus sequences and a single zinc-finger motif. Recombinant SS-A/Ro antigen produced in bacteria proved to be a sensitive and specific reagent for detection of anti-SS-A/Ro antibodies in patient sera. The availability of the 60-kD SS-A/Ro cDNA will enable detailed analysis of the molecular structure and function of the SS-A/Ro RNP particle and its role in autoimmune pathology.\r"

This study was carried out to characterize the effects of GM-CSF on polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) more extensively. Using Northern blot analysis, we show that PMN are able to accumulate mRNAs for different cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha); G-CSF, and M-CSF, all of which are involved in inflammation and hematopoiesis. Biological assays and immunoassays demonstrate that PMN translate these mRNAs, except TNF-alpha, into secretory proteins. However, the expression of these cytokines is dependent on stimulation by exogenous signals, preferentially provided by the T cell-derived lymphokine GM-CSF. Stimulation of hematopoiesis and amplification of defense mechanisms after T cell activation thus might involve not only monocytes but also PMN, a cell type previously believed to be biosynthetically inactive.\r"

Group 1 diabetic rats studied after routine micropuncture preparation exhibited elevation of the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) due to increases in the glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference and glomerular plasma flow rate. In group 2 diabetic rats infusion of insulin to achieve acute blood glucose control normalized the glomerular transcapillary pressure gradient while increasing the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, so that SNGFR remained elevated. Persistent elevation of SNGFR despite normalization of the transcapillary pressure gradient was also observed in group 3 diabetic rats infused with insulin plus sufficient dextrose to maintain hyperglycemia. These studies indicate that glomerular capillary hypertension in diabetes is an acutely reversible consequence of insulin deficiency and not the result of renal hypertrophy.\r"

First, the maternal and paternal X chromosomes were distinguished by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Second, the patterns of methylation of X chromosome genes using methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases were determined. Of the six X chromosome probes tested, only the phosphoglycerol-kinase (PGK) and hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT) clones were informative, indicating that other X chromosome probes are not useful for X inactivation analysis. After digestion with Hpa II or Hha I, the hybridization intensity of the RFLPs of all three mothers and an unaffected sister were diminished by 50%, consistent with random X chromosome inactivation. The methylation patterns of the X chromosomes of the affected females, however, were clearly nonrandom. Depending upon the probe and the patient, HPRT and PGK sequences were either completely methylated or unmethylated. These findings are extremely suggestive that nonrandom X chromosome inactivation (lyonization) is the basis for severe hemophilia in these females.\r"

Marrow aspirate specimens were obtained for these studies from cyclic neutropenia patients (both during neutropenic nadirs and during recovery phases of cycles), from leukemia patients in remission who had received myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and from healthy normal volunteers. Nucleated marrow cells were then isolated by density-gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved to permit studies of CFU-GM from patients and controls to be carried out at the same time and in replicate. Maximum clonal growth of CFU-GM from normal subjects and from individuals recovering from drug-induced myelosuppression was elicited by 20-100 pmol/liter rhGM-CSF, and the CSF concentrations that induced half-maximal responses (ED50) were between 1.0 and 3.0 pmol/liter. In contrast, maximum growth of CFU-GM from the cyclic neutropenia patients required greater than or equal to 1.0 nmol/liter rhGM-CSF and ED50's were greater than 30.0 pmol/liter. These abnormalities in the GM-CSF responsive growth of myeloid progenitors were independent of cycle time and were most apparent with the predominantly neutrophilic 7-d CFU-GM. Moreover, differences in the growth of 14-d CFU-GM could be attributed mostly if not entirely to differences in the generation of neutrophilic colonies. These findings indicate that childhood onset cyclic neutropenia is associated with an underlying disturbance in the GM-CSF responsive growth of myeloid progenitors committed to neutrophilic differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, angiotensin II (Ang II) has been shown to cause hypertrophy of cultured quiescent rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells. This observation along with the demonstration of angiotensinogen mRNA in the vessel wall has led us to postulate a role for vascular angiotensin in hypertensive blood vessel hypertrophy. To investigate further the possible molecular mechanisms, we examined the effect of Ang II on the expression of two genes known to be involved with cellular growth response. Near-confluent RASM cells were made quiescent by 48-h exposure to a defined serum-free medium. Ang II (10(-6) to 10(-11) M) resulted in an induction of the protooncogene c-myc mRNA within 30 min which persisted for 6 h. Interestingly, 6 h after the addition of Ang II, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain mRNA expression was elevated, peaked in 9 h, and persisted for 11 h. This was accompanied with a 15-20-fold increase in PDGF concentration in the culture medium. These effects were dose-dependent and were blocked by saralasin. Whereas the inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide resulted in a stabilization of c-myc mRNA, cycloheximide abolished the elevation of the PDGF A-chain mRNA. Taken together, our data show that exposure of RASM cells to Ang II results in the sequential activation of c-myc and PDGF A-chain mRNA expressions. This sequential activation of protooncogene and growth factor gene may be an important mechanism in angiotensin-induced smooth muscle growth and hypertrophy.\r"

Polyclonal antibody prepared from recombinant HBcAg seemed to be more sensitive in detecting HBcAg than did monoclonal antibody from the same antigen. The topographical distribution of HBcAg detected by these two antibodies was similar, showing a close correlation to the histological activity of disease. Furthermore, the predominant localisation of cytoplasmic HBcAg usually reflected an active and severe ongoing hepatitis. On the other hand, monoclonal antibody prepared from purified Dane particles resulted in the prominent cytoplasmic staining for HBcAg regardless of histological severity of the hepatitis. The quantitative expression and topographical distribution of HBcAg depended on the type of anti-HBc antibodies used.\r"

A considerable difference was observed between the results of bone marrow aspirates and the findings of plastic-embedded bone marrow biopsy specimens, particularly in marrow cellularity, extent of blast cell infiltration, and cell type involved in the leukaemic process. The myelomonocytic cell type seemed to predominate in the sections. In four cases there was considerable marrow infiltration with maturing, but dysplastic, granulocytic cells in the sections, but not in the aspirate smears. Features of potential prognostic importance, such as bone marrow infiltration with inflammatory cells, were easily recognised and quantified in the sections. These results indicate that plastic embedded bone marrow biopsy sections complement the findings of bone marrow aspiration in the diagnosis of AML and may also provide information of independent prognostic importance that cannot be obtained by other means.\r"

All patients were in New York Heart Association class II, III or IV and had remained symptomatic despite therapy with digoxin and diuretics. After a 4 to 14 day placebo baseline period, patients were randomized to receive either lisinopril, 5 mg orally once per day (n = 94), or captopril, 12.5 mg orally three times per day (n = 95), in addition to continuation of digoxin and diuretics. The dose of study drug could be doubled at 4 week intervals for a total of 12 weeks of double-blind therapy. The maximal dose was 20 mg once per day of lisinopril or 50 mg three times per day of captopril. The addition of either lisinopril or captopril to a regimen of diuretics or digoxin, or both, caused an increase in exercise duration as assessed on a motorized treadmill. When protocol violators were excluded, patients receiving lisinopril had a statistically greater increase in exercise duration than that of patients receiving captopril. In patients with renal impairment (serum creatinine greater than 1.6 mg/dl at baseline), lisinopril was superior to captopril in improving exercise duration. Lisinopril, but not captopril, increased left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with moderately to severely (less than 35%) decreased function (p less than 0.05). Improvement in functional capacity and quality of life, as assessed by the Yale Scale dyspnea/fatigue index, was significantly greater for the lisinopril group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During balloon inflation, 13 patients developed inferior lead ST depression in addition to anterior lead ST elevation (Group 1), whereas the remaining 14 patients did not (Group 2). The degree of anterior lead ST elevation in Group 1 (5 mm) was greater than that in Group 2 (1.5 mm, p less than 0.001) as was the reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (24% versus 13%, respectively; p less than 0.02). Anterior and apical regional shortening decreased in both groups similarly, but an additional decrease in anterobasal shortening was confined to Group 1 (from 38% to 21%; p less than 0.002). Despite the presence of inferior lead ST depression in Group 1, inferior regional shortening did not change and inferobasal contraction was enhanced (from 4% to 29%; p less than 0.01). Inferior lead ST segment depression during anterior descending coronary angioplasty reflects a greater degree of anterior wall ischemia. The concurrent preservation of inferior wall contraction and the augmentation of infero-basal shortening confirm that this electrocardiographic feature is a \"reciprocal\" phenomenon rather than a manifestation of remote ischemia.\r"

Results of the delphi process were utilized in the design of a questionnaire which would identify attributes and qualifications essential for success. The questionnaire was administered to a random sample of 300 members of the Dietitians in Business and Industry Practice Group and 300 prospective and current employers of dietitians. Response rates of 45.7% (no. = 137) and 29.0% (no. = 87) were attained for the dietitians and employers, respectively. The majority of current employers (72%) and prospective employers (62%) and dietitians (73%) responded that the trend of hiring dietitians in business and industry was increasing. Both dietitians (53%) and employers (41%) reported that new positions were being created for dietitians in their organizations. Operational experience was more important for positions in sales, whereas clinical experience was more important for positions in manufacturing organizations. Employers ranked a master's degree in business administration (MBA) as the second most important qualification; dietitians rated the MBA as fifteenth in importance. Dietitians ranked registration status (RD) as, fourth in importance; however, employers rated registration status as least important of the qualifications. Both employers and dietitians ranked communication skills as essential to succeed in business and industry positions.\r"

  ".W": "The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) presents a challenge for dietitians. Changes in the immune system have a potentially detrimental effect on nutritional status as a result of conditions such as anorexia, infection, diarrhea, and drug side effects. Conversely, poor nutrition status may adversely alter the immune systems. Dietary guidelines for the management of these conditions and additional obstacles are discussed. When counseling patients with AIDS, the dietitian needs to be aware of and sensitive to alternative therapies, to evaluate their effectiveness, and to assist in determining their place in the patient's treatment. Psychosocial factors that could influence nutritional status, such as dementia, unemployment, and isolation, must also be taken into consideration. A nutrition program has been established to address the needs of AIDS patients at AIDS Project Los Angeles-Necessities of Life Program (APLA-NOLP), a food distribution center. The goal of the program is to maintain or improve the client's nutritional status by providing education and counseling. The nutrition program has been enthusiastically received, and the outcome of the program on the nutritional status of the participants is currently under study. The dietitian is in a unique position to intervene by providing resource information, food preparation tips, and individualized nutrition plans. It is imperative that the dietitian become familiar with the AIDS disease process and its implications for nutritional status to be considered an expert in the nutrition management of such patients.\r"

We reviewed the literature to determine the prerequisites of creative thinking and assessed the management and administrative dietetics curriculum for our dietetic internship to determine whether those prerequisites were being met. A major concern in the dietetics profession is that students are not being adequately prepared to assume top management positions. A review of business school curriculums reveals that an emphasis on management theory and quantitative analysis does not adequately prepare students to function effectively in a world where creative problem solving is required. Effective managers at high levels of responsibility rely on intuition and hunches in addition to logical thought processes. Two thinking models are employed by managers--a rational one (hard box) and an intuitive one (soft bubble). These thinking models, or cognitive styles, can also be defined as left and right brain skills. Effective managers use left and right brain skills plus a combination of the two, or integrative brain skill. We reviewed the competencies, behavioral objectives, and planned experiences for the management level rotations of our dietetic internship to develop a conceptual model for the use of right, left, or integrative thought processes. We discovered that although integrative brain skills are used at all levels of our management rotations, especially the top management rotation, no rotation exclusively fosters right-brain skill development. A dietetic internship offers a fertile environment for developing the creative problem-solving skills that are required in management positions in the health care profession today.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-one of the 35 patients (88.6%) developed urinary tract colonization. The mean time from initiation of catheterization to development of colonization was 5.7 +/- 1.3 days. Persistent bacteriuria with one or several different microorganisms developed in 17 patients. The most common colonizing organisms were coagulase negative staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus. Four patients (11%) developed symptomatic urinary tract infection. Although urinary tract colonization was common in patients receiving intermittent urethral catheterization, especially in those with poor functional status, infection was uncommon. Based on these results, intermittent urethral catheterization appears to be a safe and effective method of bladder drainage in elderly male patients when performed with sterile techniques over short periods of time in the nursing home or hospital setting.\r"

The potential for great vessel injury as well as acute airway compromise makes the retrosternal disruption of the sternoclavicular joint a surgical emergency that must be diagnosed quickly. Diagnosis is enhanced by the cephalic tilt view and by computed tomography (CT scan), as planar x-ray and tomography do not always reveal this potentially life-threatening condition. Surgical consultation must be sought acutely; however, management may need to begin prior to definitive repair. Emergency management begins by suspecting the injury, and with immediate airway and circulatory support for the patient.\r"

  ".U": "89198507\r", 
  ".W": "When cultured with IL-2, human lymphoid cells acquire the ability to lyse various NK-resistant tumor targets. Due to their anti-tumor cytolytic effect, clinical trials with IL-2 alone or IL-2 + IL-2-activated killer (IAK) lymphocytes have been undertaken. However, infusion of therapeutically effective doses of IL-2 is associated with the development of systemic toxicity characterized by exaggerated endothelial permeability, also known as vascular leak syndrome. The present study was designed to examine the effects of IAK cells and their secreted products on vascular endothelial permeability by using an in vitro endothelial permeability model in which the flux of FITC-albumin across endothelial cell (EC) monolayers was measured. When endothelial monolayers were exposed to IAK cells for 2 h, significant increases in the transendothelial permeability to albumin were observed. Exposure of EC to lymphocytes cultured in the absence of IL-2 did not induce significant alteration in the endothelial permeability. In addition, neither culture supernatants of IAK cells nor purified recombinant cytokines, including IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, M-CSF, and IFN-gamma, had any effect on endothelial permeability in this model. Prior activation of EC with TNF-alpha did not alter the increased permeability induced by IAK cells or lack of it by nonactivated lymphocytes. Dexamethasone treatment of IAK cells abolished their anti-tumor cytolytic effect but only partially inhibited their ability to induce increased endothelial permeability. Pretreatment of IAK cells with mAb directed at the CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) adhesion complex, and that of EC with mAb directed at the ICAM-1 molecule, inhibited the IAK cell-induced increase in endothelial permeability. These results demonstrate that direct cell-to-cell contact between IAK cells and EC is necessary and sufficient to cause increased endothelial permeability in this model system, and may therefore be an important factor contributing to the development of the vascular leak syndrome observed clinically.\r"

We failed to detect significant numbers of A108 bearing cells in the lymph nodes of MRL-Mp/+/+, normal C3H or normal C57BL/6 mice. Therefore, the expression of A108 correlates with the presence of the lpr/lpr gene. A108 binds to a variety of murine T cell tumor lines (e.g., EL4, BW5147, and YAC-1) and human T cell tumor lines (e.g., MOLT-3, Sup T1, and Jurkat). A108 does not bind to normal human PBL.

This conclusion was indicated by comparisons of two antigenic forms of the Ld molecule separated by sequential immunoprecipitation. Whereas, mAb 30-5-7+ Ld molecules were found to exist either as free H chains or associated with beta 2m, 30-5-7- Ld molecules showed no beta 2m association. Chemical comparisons showed 30-5-7- Ld molecules to be highly sensitive to proteolysis relative to 30-5-7+ Ld molecules. Experiments employing a construct with the Ld gene juxtaposed to the inducible metallothionein promoter indicated that the ratio of the antigenic forms of Ld was determined by the relative synthesis of beta 2m vs class I proteins. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the two antigenic forms of Ld do not share a precursor-product relationship, but do display disparate rates of intracellular transport. beta 2m dissociation or exchange at the cell surface was found not to affect the ratio of the two antigenic forms of Ld. In contrast to these findings with Ld, the Dd and Ddml molecules were not detected in alternative conformations, thus mapping this property to the N-terminus of the class I molecule. These findings support the notion that beta 2m induces conformation on the alpha 1/alpha 2 domains of Ld molecules during de novo synthesis and once beta 2m-conformed, the class I structure is fixed and irreversible.\r"

  ".U": "89198527\r", 
  ".W": "We have examined the requirement for beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) in the intracellular transport of murine class I histocompatibility molecules to the cell surface. R1E cells that are defective in the synthesis of beta 2m were transfected with either the class I H-2Kb or H-2Db genes alone, or together with the beta 2m gene. Kb or Db heavy chains synthesized in the presence of beta 2m were transported rapidly through the cell and expressed efficiently at the cell surface. In the absence of beta 2m, no \"free\" Kb heavy chains were detectable at the cell surface and their intracellular transport was blocked at an early stage. In contrast, a significant quantity of \"free\" Db heavy chains could be detected at the cell surface as we have reported previously. However, we have shown here that defects in intracellular transport were apparent in that the majority (approximately 70%) of newly synthesized Db heavy chains accumulated intracellularly and were degraded. Therefore, although Kb and Db heavy chains differ in their abilities to be expressed at the cell surface in the absence of beta 2m they both require association with beta 2m for efficient intracellular transport. In addition, R1E cells transfected with a deletion construct of the Kb gene expressed a truncated molecule lacking the alpha 3 extracellular domain (Kb-3) at the cell surface, but, like free Db, most newly synthesized Kb-3 molecules accumulated intracellularly. The free Kb, Kb-3, and Db heavy chains were not recognized by most mAb specific for Kb and Db, respectively. Therefore, even the transported forms of free Db and Kb-3 were not native in conformation, which is surprising given the current view that correct folding is essential for intracellular transport. Interestingly, the free Db and Kb-3 heavy chains that reached the cell surface differed in their detergent binding properties from those retained within the cell. This suggests that the transported heavy chains may have folded differently thus allowing their export to the cell surface.\r"

  ".W": "The specificity of the basic bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI) of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) for gram-negative bacteria is attributable to its strong attraction for the negatively charged envelope LPS. The antibacterial activity of PMN homogenates or extracts toward Escherichia coli corresponds to their BPI content and is blocked by anti-BPI IgG, suggesting that BPI action is unaffected by the presence of other PMN proteins. To test if BPI is preferentially bound to E. coli when other antibacterial proteins are present, we have measured binding in buffered (pH 7.5) balanced salts solution of [125I] human BPI to E. coli J5 in the presence and absence of other human PMN granule proteins. BPI binding is saturable with an apparent K = 23 nM and 2.2 million binding sites/cell. While binding of [125I] human BPI is competitively inhibited by human or rabbit BPI, it is only weakly inhibited by myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, or cathepsin G. In contrast, myeloperoxidase binding to E. coli is strongly inhibited by BPI. Moreover, incubation of E. coli with crude extracts of PMN or CML spleen results in near quantitative binding of BPI, identified by silver staining and immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE of the washed E. coli pellet, without recognizable binding of other leukocyte proteins (greater than 98% of added total protein is recovered in supernatant). After addition of 200 mM MgCl2, approximately 80% of bound BPI is released as fully active and pure protein (as judged by SDS-PAGE and HPLC). Thus the selective and reversible binding of BPI in crude PMN extracts to target bacteria provides a one-step \"affinity\" purification procedure.\r"

Binding studies of affinity chromatography-purified anti-Gal antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi and American Leishmania parasites indeed demonstrated the presence of Gal alpha 1----3Gal epitopes on these parasites. This finding was supported by the observed binding to the parasites of two additional Gal alpha 1----3Gal recognizing molecules: the mAb Gal-13, and the lectin, Bandeiraea simplicifolia I B4. Furthermore, the binding of both anti-Gal antibody and of the B. simplicifolia I B4 lectin could be inhibited by galactose, and not glucose. In addition, removal of the terminal alpha-galactosyl residues from the parasites by pretreatment with alpha-galactosidase, or the oxidation of the binding epitopes by periodate prevented the subsequent binding of both the antibody and the lectin. A crude leishmanial lipid extract readily bound these three reagents, suggesting that at least part of these epitopes are of a glycolipid nature. These Gal alpha 1----3Gal epitopes may thus serve as an antigenic source for the excess production of anti-Gal. In view of the naturally high level of anti-Gal in humans and its binding to T. cruzi and Leishmania, it is argued that these antibodies may contribute to the natural defense against the invasion of such parasites.\r"

  ".W": "In a recent study, we demonstrated that certain reactivities crucial to the immune response in leprosy are due to protein associated with the cell wall peptidoglycan \"core\" of Mycobacterium leprae. We now describe a primary method for the isolation of a highly immunogenic, large molecular-size, cell wall protein (CW-P) complex from M. leprae, freed of soluble proteins, bound mycolates, arabinogalactan, and much of the peptidoglycan. The complex is of apparent relative molecular size 2 x 10(6) to 20 x 10(6) Da, is distinguished by a high content of Ala, Gly, Leu, Asx, and Glx, and some peptidoglycan, and represents up to 7% of the bacterial mass. It is stable to a variety of dissociation and reductive processes and, in accord with its size, is not resolvable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mAb to the CW-P complex also react with the heat shock 65-kDa protein of M. leprae. Conversely, antibodies that recognize internal epitopes within the polypeptide chain of the heat shock protein also react with CW-P; however, antibodies that recognize the N and C termini of the 65-kDa protein fail to react with CW-P, and some anti-CW-P mAb do not recognize any of the soluble proteins of M. leprae. Alternate methods to derive the large peptidoglycan-associated protein result in lower yield and less of the associated heat shock protein, implying that the 65-kDa protein may not be crucial to the immunogenicity of the complex. In an accompanying paper, we demonstrate that T cell clones raised to CW-P also selectively recognize soluble proteins, primarily of 7-kDa and 16-kDa size. Thus, the image of the CW-P complex of M. leprae is of a few immunoreactive polypeptides in avid association with a modicum of peptidoglycan to which the 65-kDa polypeptide may be variably attached, perhaps due to involvement in assembly of the complex.\r"

We have previously demonstrated that cell wall proteins of Mycobacterium leprae are highly immunogenic. By using human cell wall-specific T cell clones we have begun to characterize soluble proteins that integrate into the cell wall skeleton. T cells from leprosy lesions were expanded with IL-2 in vitro yet retained specificity to Ag of the insoluble cell wall core (CWC) in vitro, indicating that T cells had been activated by CWC Ag in vivo. A cell wall protein-peptidoglycan complex and cell wall protein preparations lacking carbohydrates and lipids from CWC retained T cell reactivity. To identify immunogenic protein component(s) of cell wall protein, T cell lines were established to cell walls and tested against M. leprae proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Greatest T cell reactivity was observed to proteins of Mr 7 kDa, 16 kDa, and 28 kDa. T cell clones reactive with 7-kDa and 16-kDa Ag from gels failed to respond to proteins of other Mr separated under either reducing or nonreducing conditions, indicating that these molecules are not subunits of larger proteins and may represent monomeric units polymerized into cell walls. The approaches described herein for characterization of immunodominant T cell Ag of M. leprae may be useful for study of T cell Ag in cell walls of bacterial pathogens of man.\r"

  ".W": "It has previously been reported that MHC class I-deficient RBL-5 and YAC-1 lymphoma sublines show an enhanced NK sensitivity in vitro. In the present study such lymphoma variants were found to have different defects in H-2 biosynthesis such as 1) reduced beta 2-microglobulin and H-2 H chain transcription, 2) block in beta 2-microglobulin translation, and 3) impaired association between beta 2-microglobulin and H-2 H chains. For lines with the latter two defects, the results suggested that a major part of the H chains were arrested before the middle Golgi complex as indicated by their failure to undergo carbohydrate side chain trimming. The data suggest that NK sensitivity can be directly influenced by the membrane expression of MHC class I gene products of tumor targets because three independent molecular defects, all interfering with the cell surface H-2 expression, gave rise to NK-sensitive phenotypes. These variant lines will also be useful tools for studies of H-2 glycoprotein assembly and transport and for Ag presentation to CTL.\r"

  ".W": "There are four main subclasses of human IgG: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, among which IgG1-IgG3 activate complement, but IgG4 does not. We studied the IgG subclasses of anti-intercellular (IC) antibodies in pemphigus patients and anti-basement membrane zone (BMZ) antibodies in bullous pemphigoid (BP) patients by immunofluorescent staining using mouse monoclonal antibodies against human IgG1-IgG4. At the same time, the capability of complement fixation of each serum was determined by means of complement immunofluorescence. In both pemphigus and BP autoantibodies, various distributions of IgG subclass were shown, but specific patterns were not observed. In BP, all of the complement fixing antibodies had at least one of IgG1-IgG3 subclasses, while noncomplement fixing antibodies only possessed IgG4. This result agreed well with the biologic characteristics of IgG subclasses in respect of complement fixing capability. On the contrary, in pemphigus, the circulating antibodies showed a distribution of IgG subclass which did not correlate with the biologic characteristics in terms of complement activation. This discrepancy may further dispute the roles of the complement system on the bulla formation in pemphigus.\r"

  ".W": "We provide evidence that stratum corneum (SC) activates complement through the alternative pathway to generate C5a anaphylatoxin. By immunofluorescence studies it was shown that in addition to circulating IgG autoantibody, there were anti-SC antibodies of IgM and IgA classes in the sera from normal individuals. However, all the titers were significantly lower than the level of C3 deposition between corneocytes. By contrast, no C1q deposition occurred. Immunoelectrophoretically the orthokeratotic SC homogenates were found to induce the conversion of C3 from native C3 to C3b in fresh human serum even when the classic pathway was blocked by Ca2+-chelation. Enzyme immunoassay showed that factor B split product, Bb, was generated by the SC homogenates in the Ca2+-chelated serum. Radioimmunoassay for C5a also demonstrated that the SC homogenates could generate C5a anaphylatoxin in serum to an extent similar to that in non-treated serum when restricted to the alternative pathway activation; neutrophil chemotactic activity was generated in Ca2+-chelated serum at levels comparable to that generated in non-treated fresh serum. We separated the SC samples into a cornified envelope and soluble and keratin fractions. The cornified envelope was more effective in activating complement. This activity resided in heat-stable and non-lipid substances of corneocytes. Our hypothesis is that when the SC comes in contact with serum, it activates complement mainly through the alternative pathway to induce chemotactic C5a anaphylatoxin. Hence, inflammation in normal individuals after a traumatic injury to the skin or rupture of acne comedones, or epidermal cysts and possibly the formation of subcorneal sterile pustules noted in several dermatoses are explainable through this mechanism.\r"

That hypothesis is further supported by recent studies suggesting that monoclonal antibodies to type VII collagen do not react with the basement membrane in most patients. To investigate further, we examined skin from 12 patients by electron microscopy and by immunohistology and immunoelectron microscopy using a concentrated and purified monoclonal antibody to the carboxy-terminal domain of Type VII collagen. Although anchoring fibrils were not detected by electron microscopy, the results of immunohistology showed definite, but reduced, binding of the monoclonal antibody to type VII collagen at the basement membrane in a linear pattern in 11 of 12 patients. By immunoelectron microscopy, reduced deposition of anti-type VII collagen antibody was detected beneath the lamina densa. The results of this study show that the carboxyl-terminal domain of type VII collagen is synthesized, secreted, and deposited at the basement membrane zone in 11 of 12 patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa and suggest that the absence of anchoring fibrils may be due either to deposition of abnormal type VII collagen, reduced levels of normal type VII collagen, defective assembly of type VII collagen into anchoring fibrils, or destruction of the collagenous domain of type VII collagen.\r"

  ".W": "Among the cutaneous effects of an essential fatty acid deficient (EFAD) diet are hyperdesquamation, increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and altered lipid profiles, characteristics also common to inflammatory dermatoses. Because fatty acids are antimicrobial, we examined the indigenous skin flora of normal and EFAD hairless mice, and compared the antimicrobial efficacy of lipids extracted from their stratum corneum. EFAD mice supported 100-fold more bacteria than normal mice, and were the only group from which Staphylococcus aureus were routinely isolated. Despite this greater carriage, in vitro experiments demonstrated that EFAD lipids are more lethal than normal lipids against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus sp., and a coryneform. Skin fungi were equally susceptible to both extracts. After thin layer chromatography, the most active fractions were found to be glycosphingolipids and phospholipids. EFAD extracts had 35% more free fatty acids and 75% more glycosphingolipids; normal extracts had more triglycerides and phospholipids. S. aureus strain 502A survived equally well on EFAD as on normal mice. Normal lipids applied on EFAD mice had no additional effect, but EFAD lipids on normal mice brought about a 35% reduction of the inoculated bacteria. If the mice were pretreated with alcohol, carriage of strain 502A was reduced by 71%. If instead the mice were previously washed with acetone to increase TEWL, a 97% reduction of the staphylococcus occurred. The application of normal flora to such acetone-washed mice decreased the efficacy to 76%. EFAD and normal lipids on human subjects were equally ineffective in eliminating strain 502A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Such apposition occurs in actively sensitized patients and guinea pigs and in passively sensitized guinea pigs. In addition, in passively sensitized guinea pigs, Langerhans cells circulate in dermal vessels resembling lymphatics and are much increased in the dermis after challenge with the contact allergen. These observations, together with the existing knowledge that Langerhans cells occur in the lymph nodes and thymus, suggest that these cells may be involved not only in contact allergic reactions but also in other immunologic reactions, particularly in cell-mediated reactions in the skin.\r"

Both nonproliferative and proliferative primary cultures may be subcultured on collagen gels following dispersion by trypsin and EDTA. Methotrexate strongly inhibits proliferative keratinocytes at low concentrations (0.1 microgram/ml) but has no cytotoxic effect on non-proliferative cells. L-serine and dexamethasone increase the multiplication rate of both primary and subcultured human keratinocytes.\r"

Previous studies of the immunopathogenesis of ABPA have indicated that B cells (IgG and IgE antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus), T cells, and eosinophils are components of the disease. To evaluate T-cell regulation, we examined in vitro immune responses in seven patients with CF and ABPA compared with subjects who had a positive reaction to an A. fumigatus (Af) prick skin test, an IgG precipitating antibody test, or both (ST/PPT), and with subjects with CF who had negative prick skin test results and precipitating antibodies to Af (Af negative). Analyses of T-cell phenotypes revealed that patients with CF and ABPA compared with patients with CF who had ST/PPT positive and Af negative results had slightly increased percentages of T-helper cells, 50.1% versus 43.0% (p not significant) and 42.2 (p less than 0.025), respectively, but comparable percentages and numbers of T-suppressor cells. Serum IgE concentrations were significantly increased in subjects with CF and ABPA versus both subjects who had ST/PPT-positive and Af-negative results, 2916 versus 281 and 73 IU/ml (p less than 0.001 and less than 0.001, respectively). In addition, B cells from patients with CF and ABPA had significantly increased in vitro preformed IgE (p less than 0.01) and increased spontaneous de novo IgE spontaneous synthesis compared with cells from subjects who had ST/PPT positive and Af-negative results (p less than 0.01 and less than 0.01), indicating prior in vivo activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To study mechanisms of complex thrombus formation in vivo, and to compare the relative antithrombotic effects of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, a model was developed in baboons. Segments of collagen-coated tubing followed by two sequentially placed expansion chambers exhibiting disturbed flow patterns were exposed to native blood under laminar flow conditions. The device was incorporated for 1 hour into an exteriorized arteriovenous shunt in baboons under controlled blood flow (20 ml/min). Morphologic evaluation by scanning electron microscopy showed that thrombi associated with collagen were relatively rich in platelets but thrombi in the chambers were rich in fibrin and red cells. Deposition of indium 111-labeled platelets was continuously measured with a scintillation camera. Platelet deposition increased in a linear (collagen-coated segment) or exponential (chambers 1 and 2) fashion over time, with values after 40 minutes averaging 24.1 +/- 3.3 x 10(8) platelets (collagen segment), 16.7 +/- 3.4 x 10(8) platelets (chamber 1), and 8.4 +/- 2.4 x 10(8) platelets (chamber 2). Total fibrinogen deposition after 40 minutes was determined by using iodine 125-labeled baboon fibrinogen and averaged 0.58 +/- 0.14 mg in the collagen segment, 1.51 +/- 0.27 mg in chamber 1, and 0.95 +/- 0.25 mg in chamber 2. Plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG), platelet-factor 4 (PF4), and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) increased fourfold to fivefold after 60 minutes of blood exposure to the thrombotic device. Platelet deposition onto the collagen segment, chamber 1, and chamber 2 was linearly dependent on the circulating platelet count. Platelet accumulation in chamber 1 and chamber 2 was also dependent on the presence of the proximal collagen segment. An anticoagulating dose of standard heparin decreased platelet deposition in the chambers (p less than 0.05) but did not decrease deposition onto the collagen segment. Although beta TG and PF4 levels remained elevated after the administration of standard heparin, the elevation in plasma FPA was interrupted. Further evidence that the thrombotic process was dependent on platelets was provided by the finding that prostaglandin I2 at high concentration (35 ng/ml) decreased platelet deposition onto the collagen segment and in chambers 1 and 2, decreased beta TG and PF4 release, and reduced FPA formation. The combination of standard heparin and PGI2 produced the most potent inhibition of platelet thrombus formation and prevented the increases in plasma PF4, beta TG and FPA.\r"

In each case long term topical steroid sprays had been prescribed and the patients had been referred for further management of their 'rhinitis'. Spontaneous CSF rhinorrhoea is potentially life threatening as failure to recognize the problem may lead to the development of meningitis and possibly death. The diagnosis is simple and is based on a good clinical history which may be confirmed by chemical pathology. Radiology is often non-contributory, the site of the leak may have to be identified at surgery. Morbidity and mortality are reduced if an extracranial, trans-nasal/external ethmoid route for repair of the fistula is employed. Three case reports are presented and the diagnosis and management of CSF rhinorrhoea is reviewed.\r"

IgG class ANCA producing diffuse cytoplasmic immunostaining were detected in 54% of the patients. With reservation for the difficulties involved in distinguishing between different forms of systemic vasculitis, these autoantibodies were present in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (12 out of 17 patients), polyarteritis nodosa (4/6), idiopathic extracapillary glomerulonephritis (1/4), and with less distinct syndromes (4/10), but not in Henoch-Schonlein's purpura (0/2). Another 18% of the patients showed granulocyte-specific anti-nuclear antibodies' with perinuclear immunostaining. This pattern was recently reported to indicate the presence of antibody against myeloperoxidase of alcohol-fixed neutrophils. Autoimmune mechanisms, particularly those involving components of neutrophil granulocytes, could play a significant role in development of extracapillary glomerulonephritis.\r"

The application of quality of life data to the practice setting is frequently difficult, however. The effective use of this information requires an understanding of its definition and measurement, as well as of study methods. Quality of life findings may be specific to particular disease states, patient populations, and pharmacologic agents. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to concurrent methyldopa, propranolol, or captopril therapy has been reported to reduce patients' overall sense of well-being. beta-Adrenergic blockers may exert either positive or negative effects on quality of life. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may have positive effects on quality of life; however, the cost of therapy is an important consideration. Information on calcium antagonists is limited. The findings of the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) may eventually provide comparative quality of life data on the four first-line antihypertensive therapies.\r"

In the double-blind part of the study, relative to open treatment with STD, ten patients rated themselves as improved while taking CR4, whereas only three considered themselves improved with STD. Difficulties using CR4 included an increased \"lag-time\" to the onset of antiparkinson effect, a tendency to produce increasingly severe dyskinesia late in the day, and a somewhat lessened predictability of motor response. Nonetheless, since the overall level of motor function through the day was equal to or better than that attained with STD, but with fewer medication administrations, Sinemet CR4 should prove a useful antiparkinsonian agent.\r"

Nearly 30% of patients with single-hemisphere strokes were initially found to have difficulty swallowing a mouthful of water, but in most of those who survived, the deficit had resolved by the end of the first week. Strong correlations were found between dysphagia and speech impairment (comprehension and expression) and with facial weakness, but there was no association with the side of the stroke. After controlling for other markers of overall stroke severity such as conscious level, urinary continence, white blood cell count and strength in the affected limbs, swallowing impairment still showed a significant inverse correlation with functional ability at 1 and 6 months. These results indicate that, even if dysphagia itself is not responsible for much excess mortality in acute stroke, it might still lead to complications which hamper functional recovery.\r"

This IFAP is detectable by antibodies in normal rabbit serum (F2N) and is closely associated with glial fibrillary acidic protein-containing intermediate filaments (IF). The expression of 48 kDa IFAP is related to the acquisition of stellate shape by normal and reactive-like astrocytes in vitro. It is proposed that 48 kDa IFAP may be responsible for cross-linking IF into bundles and is thereby associated with cell process formation.\r"

Of these, 35 took the form of multiple microabscesses. There were 19 men and 16 women, mean age 56. All patients were chronically ill, usually with an associated impaired immunity. The lung was the most frequent site of primary infection, and sepsis was often present. The most commonly identified causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Patients with CNS microabscesses developed a progressive encephalopathy associated with waxing and waning signs and symptoms. Laboratory and neuroradiologic studies were not helpful in elucidating the problem. We conclude that multiple microabscesses are a frequent, usually unrecognized, manifestation of CNS infection, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of encephalopathy in hospitalized patients with chronic disease, immunosuppression and sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "A number of human studies presented at the workshop indicate that the premature infant at birth is biochemically deficient in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in both the brain and liver phospholipids, and that DHA is essential for normal visual acuity. The amount of DHA necessary to maintain normal amounts of the liver and brain phospholipids postnatally is 11 mg/kg daily. Elderly patients on long-term gastric tube feedings and others on long-term intravenous fluids and on total parenteral nutrition are particularly prone to deficiencies of alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA. The amounts estimated to prevent deficiencies in the elderly are 800-1100 mg/d of alpha-linolenic acid and 300-400 mg/d of EPA and DHA combined. Preliminary data indicate that children with malnutrition and mucoviscidosis, women with toxemia, and elderly people have decreased amounts of DHA in plasma phospholipids. The omega 3 fatty acids lower triglycerides and, at high levels, lower cholesterol. The anti-aggregatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of omega 3 fatty acids have been confirmed, and a dose-response curve is emerging. Despite the increase in bleeding time, no clinical evidence of bleeding has been noted by the investigators in any of the studies. Clinical trials are necessary in order to precisely define the dose and mechanisms involved in defining the essentiality of omega 3 fatty acids in growth and development and their beneficial effects in coronary heart disease, hypertension, inflammation, arthritis, psoriasis, other autoimmune disorders, and cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Dietary fat is known to affect serum concentrations of total and lipoprotein cholesterol. However, all components of dietary triglycerides--saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids--do not have identical effects on serum cholesterol levels. Until recently, most attention has been given to saturated fatty acids, which raise cholesterol levels, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are thought by many to lower cholesterol levels. Monounsaturates in contrast have been given little attention. However, recent studies carried out in our laboratory and in others have shown that monounsaturates can have favorable effects when substituted for saturated fatty acids in the diet. In this exchange, the monounsaturates reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, but do not lower high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. In contrast, an HDL-lowering action has been noted for polyunsaturates. Also, monounsaturates appear to alter lipoproteins more favorably than carbohydrates, which can raise triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol levels. Therefore, monounsaturated fatty acids appear to have more potential for use in cholesterol-lowering diets than previously recognized.\r"

Experiments were performed in vivo using a mixture of 50 mg of ovalbumin, alpha-lactalbumin or casein, 2 micrograms of purified protease-sensitive, cholecystokinin-releasing monitor peptide and 1 mg of porcine trypsin which was infused by cannula into the duodenum of atropine-treated rats. The small intestine had previously been washed with bicarbonate to eliminate proteases and the pancreatic juice was diverted. The amount of trypsin secreted in 2 h was comparable to that of rats in which the pancreatic juice was returned into the duodenum. However, in the presence of a monitor peptide--specific antibody which recognizes the N-terminal region of the peptide, the monitor peptide did not induce any pancreatic response. Therefore, the characteristic pattern of pancreatic enzyme secretion in response to protein intake can be reproduced by infusing only three components--dietary proteins, porcine trypsin and the purified monitor peptide.\r"

A significant effect of phenotype (obese greater than lean) was observed on body weight, epididymal fat pad weight and fat cell size. A diet effect (sucrose greater than starch) was observed on body weight, fat pad weight, and fat cell size. No effect of phenotype or diet was observed on basal 3-O-methylglucose transport in isolated adipose cells. However, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was decreased 70-80% in isolated adipose cells from obese SHR/N-cp rats. No effect of diet on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was observed in obese SHR/N-cp rats. Scatchard analysis of insulin binding data demonstrated no differences in the dissociation constant (KD) for the insulin receptor:insulin complex. However, obese rats exhibited a decreased number of insulin receptors compared to lean SHR/N-cp rats. These data demonstrate that the obese SHR/N-cp rat exhibits insulin-resistant glucose transport. This altered insulin sensitivity may be one factor contributing to the development of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in these animals.\r"

These treatments continued from the first day of wk 11 of lactation through the end of wk 18 of lactation. Deuterium oxide (D2O) dilution was used to estimate D2O space at wk 10 and 18. All cattle were fed a dry, complete diet containing 2.9% nitrogen, and an estimated 1.7 Mcal/kg net energy for lactation (NE1). After 18 wk of lactation, carcass composition was determined from carcass density and the composition of the rest of the body was determined by direct chemical analyses. Regression equations were constructed relating chemical composition at 18 wk to D2O space and live body mass. These equations were used to estimate body composition at wk 10. The estimated wk 10 composition was used to adjust wk 18 body composition for pretreatment inter-animal variation. Treatment with sometribove resulted in increased milk production (34.3 kg/d vs. 30.2 kg/d), foregut tissue (25.2 kg vs. 23.2 kg), foregut contents (72.0 vs. 62.1 kg), and reduced total body fat (28.3 vs. 45.7 kg), body energy (760 vs. 916 Mcal) and visceral fat mass.\r"

The HIV-1 envelope protein was stably expressed under the control of the transactivator proteins tat and rev, in wild-type and mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The mutant, ldlD, is conditionally defective for the addition of galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine to oligosaccharide chains. The effects of glycosylation modification on the HIV-1 envelope's structure and function were examined. The effects of galactosylation on the structure of the envelope proteins suggest that cleavage of the gp160 precursor into gp120 and gp41 occurs intracellularly, apparently concurrent with the addition of galactose to N-linked oligosaccharides of the envelope proteins. No evidence for O-linked glycosylation of the envelope proteins in CHO cells was observed. The envelope protein in the transfected hamster cells mediated the fusion of these cells with CD4-positive lymphocytes, and this fusogenic activity was independent of the addition of either galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine to oligosaccharides in the transfected cells.\r"

However, the EIA that used a monoclonal anti-p24 as the capturing reagent was unable to detect any of the serial supernatant samples of a positive viral culture from an HIV-infected patient. Only the two polyclonal, non-p24-restricted assays were able to detect an unusual expression of HIV-Ag in the serum of an acute HIV-infected patient. Overall, the sensitivity of HIV-Ag capture assays was enhanced when (a) the capture antibody was polyclonal rather than monoclonal, (b) the polyclonal antibody was broad rather than p24-restricted, and (c) the probing-detecting procedure was in a two-step format rather than one-step format. In addition, the use of neutralizing assays to confirm the results was absolutely necessary.\r"

  ".W": "In the ventral horn of the sacral spinal cord of the cat, opioid terminals are preferentially localized in Onuf's nucleus, an area containing motor neurons that innervate the striated muscle of the external urethral sphincter. The present study was undertaken to 1) compare the effects of selective opioid agonists on sphincter reflex pathways with the effects of these drugs on hindlimb reflexes and urinary bladder reflexes and 2) determine if the physiological inhibition of sphincter reflexes, which accompany bladder contractions, is mediated by endogenous opioids. The effects of intrathecal (i.t.) and i.v. drug administration on bladder activity, sphincter reflexes and reflexes to the hindlimb musculature were monitored in chloralose-anesthetized cats. Ethylketocyclazocine (0.05-500 micrograms i.t.) produced a dose-dependent, naloxone-sensitive, inhibition of sphincter reflexes to less than 10% of control amplitude while having no consistent effects on hindlimb reflexes or bladder activity. D-Ser2-leu5-enkephalin-thr6 (DSLET; 0.1-2.0 micrograms i.t.) abolished rhythmic bladder activity, while having no effects on sphincter or hindlimb reflexes. Larger doses of DSLET (5.0-10 micrograms i.t.) produced a modest reduction of sphincter reflexes (to 60% of control amplitude), without affecting hindlimb reflexes. Naloxone (50 micrograms i.t.) reversed DSLETs marked inhibition of bladder activity, whereas large doses (greater than 250 micrograms i.t.) only partially antagonized DSLETs weak inhibition of sphincter reflexes. Morphine (5-500 micrograms i.t.) had no consistent effect on any of the measures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
