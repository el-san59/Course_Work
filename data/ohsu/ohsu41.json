  ".W": "We analyzed the clinical features of symptomatic posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stenosis in 6 patients selected from 15 patients with angiographically documented PCA atherostenosis occurring during a 7-year period. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) were the major presentation in 5 patients. A homonymous visual field defect was present in 2 patients. TIA symptoms were predominantly visual or sensory, or both. The most common visual symptom was difficulty seeing to one side. One patient saw flashing lights. Sensory spells were always paresthetic, usually involving the arm and hand and occasionally the face and leg. Three patients had visual and sensory spells together. Two patients with a visual field defect had calcarine infarcts found by computed tomography. All patients were treated with warfarin. During follow-up (4 months to 4 years), no patient had a new stroke in the PCA territory, and only one continued to have TIAs. PCA atherostenosis is rarer then PCA embolic occlusion. In contrast to those with PCA embolism, our patients with PCA atherostenosis had more TIAs and fewer infarcts. The clinical features of PCA stenosis--preponderance of visual and sensory TIAs--distinguish this vascular lesion from stenosis of the middle cerebral artery.\r"

We found clear electrophysiological differences between the two groups of patients in that the N1, N2, and P3 peak latencies were prolonged in the demented group compared both to the nondemented group and to normal controls. Moreover, the N1 latency but not the N2 and P3 latency prolongation distinguished the demented parkinsonian patients from demented patients with Alzheimer's disease. These results provide strong evidence for the existence of different subtypes of dementia and suggest that electrophysiological recordings may be helpful in establishing the underlying pathogenesis of a dementia syndrome when there is clinical uncertainty.\r"

The factor's activity was assayed by measuring the induction of choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in cultured sympathetic neurons. Culture medium conditioned by exposure to normal human fibroblasts induced substantial levels of CAT activity in sympathetic neurons, indicating that human fibroblasts produce a soluble factor that promotes cholinergic expression. In contrast, medium conditioned by Alzheimer fibroblasts induced only about one-third as much CAT activity, a highly significant reduction (p less than 0.01). These observations suggest that Alzheimer fibroblasts may be deficient in their secretion of a cholinergic factor and raise the possibility that the pathophysiology of the disease is related to a defect in the release of this factor. The fibroblast abnormalities suggest that Alzheimer's disease may be a systemic disease involving nonneuronal cells that are outside as well as within the brain.\r"

The present case supports the conclusion that caloric-induced nystagmus originates in the brainstem in rudimentary form.\r"

Radiotherapy seemed to have no effect in 2 patients. One patient experienced temporary improvement, but eventually died from spread of tumor. Only one definite complication of radiotherapy occurred and was related to excessive radiation dose (greater than 7,000 cGy). Irradiation in the range of 5,000 to 5,500 cGy was effective either alone or in combination with surgical excision. Serial assessment of visual acuity and fields allowed us to demonstrate and quantify improvement in our patients following radiotherapy; in contrast, follow-up computed tomographic studies rarely demonstrated reduced tumor size.\r"

  ".W": "Latencies of lateral visually guided saccades were studied in 60 patients without hemianopia who had unilateral focal lesions clearly visible on computed tomographic (CT) scan that were variously located in both cerebral hemispheres. Significantly asymmetrical latencies were found in 29 patients whose lesions had damaged the deep and posterior frontal region near the corpus callosum and/or, just inferior to this region, the anterior part of the internal capsule. In the 31 other patients, including those with lesions of the frontal eye fields (FEF), latencies were not significantly asymmetrical and the lesions spared the entire region just described. These topographical features suggest that the asymmetry of latencies is due to damage in a certain portion of the efferent pathways descending from the FEF. A significant increase in bilateral latency was observed in most patients whose lesions had damaged the posterior part of the parietal cortex and/or the underlying white matter. The parietal lobe could therefore exert an excitatory bilateral action on the triggering of visually guided saccades, probably mediated via the superior colliculus. A significant decrease in the bilateral or ipsilateral latency was often found in patients whose lesions had damaged the FEF or the underlying white matter. The frontal lobe could therefore exert a predominantly inhibitory bilateral action on this triggering, probably also mediated via the superior colliculus. However, an increase in contralateral latency in some patients with subcortical frontal lesions indicates that the FEF also probably have an excitatory action. This action could be transmitted directly (or indirectly via the superior colliculus) to the reticular premotor structures by tracts decussating partly through the corpus callosum.\r"

Although cerebrovascular disease was the most common cause in our series, surgery, particularly cardiac surgery, and cerebral angiography were also major causes. Only 3 patients denied their blindness, although 4 others were unaware of their visual loss. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) were performed during the period of blindness in 20 patients and all recordings were abnormal, with absent alpha rhythm. Visual evoked potentials recorded during blindness were abnormal in 15 of 19 patients, but did not correlate with the severity of visual loss or with outcome. Bioccipital lucencies were found in computed tomographic (CT) scans of 14 patients; none of the 14 regained good vision. Recovery of vision was poor in all 8 patients who had a spontaneous stroke, but fair or good in 11 of the other 17 patients. Prognosis was best in patients under the age of 40 years, in those without a history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus, and in those without associated cognitive, language, or memory impairments. We conclude that the prognosis in cortical blindness is poor when caused by stroke; EEGs are more useful than visual evoked potentials for diagnosis; and bioccipital abnormalities shown on CT scan are associated with a poor prognosis.\r"

Analysis revealed a lack of myelin-specific lipids, but showed a residual immunoreactivity for myelin basic protein, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphodiesterase. Examination by immunocytochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed an absence of proteolipid apoprotein (lipophilin). The peripheral nervous system was normal. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease in humans shares many neuropathological and biochemical features with X-linked mutations in animals, e.g., the jimpy mouse and myelin-deficient rat. The specificity of this protein deficiency in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease gains additional support from the recent mapping of the lipophilin gene to the human X chromosome.\r"

Twenty-three (46%) nonpregnant women had subnormal serum folate levels and 4 nonpregnant women (8%) showed subnormal red cell folate levels. In pregnant women not taking folate supplements, the incidence of folate deficiency increased as the pregnancy advanced. Pregnant women taking folate supplements achieved normal or supranormal blood folate concentrations. In both nonpregnant and pregnant women, serum and red cell folate levels were inversely correlated with plasma concentrations of phenytoin and of phenobarbital, and with the number of anticonvulsants. In 49 pregnancies, there were 10 abnormal outcomes (20.4%): 4 spontaneous abortions (8.2%) and 6 children with major congenital malformations (12.2%). Blood folate levels were significantly lower in pregnancies with an abnormal outcome than in those with a normal outcome. The results suggest a dose-response relationship among anticonvulsants, folate, and adverse pregnancy outcome.\r"

Based on data from 31 patients, the average annual incidence for the period 1971 through 1980 was 4.1 per 100,000. On December 31, 1980, the prevalence rate was 59 per 100,000.

In most patients symptoms began between the ages of 10 and 30 years, persisted for many years, and caused them to modify their activities to avoid the provoking factors of exercise, emotion, and heat. The condition usually improved with time, and five patients (14%) had a spontaneous remission. Atopy, present in about 12 (34%) of the patients, was more frequent than in the general population. Systemic symptoms were uncommon during attacks, and patients had no greater responses than controls to the intradermal tests. The histologic study revealed neutrophils in and around the walls of superficial subpapillary dermal vessels.\r"

Sixteen patients with paracoccidioidomycosis were evaluated.

The eruption resembled atopic dermatitis morphologically but was prominent on the palms and face and dramatically spared the area of the boy's feet covered by his shoes. The condition has always been seasonal, worsening in summer, especially July, and it clears on avoidance of contact. This case is believed to represent a contact dermatitis to oleoresins of Compositae plants; inhalants as a cause of systemic aggravation are not likely to be important in this patient.\r"

Organisms resistant to cephalosporins were isolated from 12 infants, six of whom developed systemic infection. Two infants died. Isolates of E. cloacae from four of five infants treated with cefotaxime showed a loss of sensitivity to this antibiotic during treatment, but in the three infants who survived sensitive organisms were again isolated after treatment had stopped. Stopping treatment with the cephalosporins, closure of the unit to new admissions, and strict cohorting of colonised infants resulted in a prompt end to the outbreak. This outbreak suggests that the routine use of third generation cephalosporins for suspected sepsis may be inappropriate in the presence of a large reservoir of organisms with the potential for rapidly developing resistance. Routine bacteriological surveillance, however, might permit their use on a rotational basis.\r"

Measurements were made on 18 normal children monthly for six months and on six normal children weekly for six weeks. Six other children measured weekly underwent tonsillectomy after three weeks to determine the effect of stress on growth. The measurement protocol permitted estimations of both inter- and intraobserver variation. Knemometry is a sensitive, precise, and robust technique that enables accurate measurements to be made of the lower leg by interchangeable observers. The lower leg does not grow smoothly and variations in growth rate seen in both healthy children and children with transient intercurrent stress limit the practical clinical value of knemometry to the measurement of linear growth in the short term.\r"

The hepatic index was compared with subjective assessment of abdominal scintigraphy performed repeatedly over 24 hours. In 22 infants with hepatitis the hepatic index ranged from 5.03 to 14.9, one having no excretion on scintiscan. In 26 infants with atresia the index ranged from 0.49 to 4.26 and in two with paucity of intralobular bile ducts it was 1.85 and 3.69. None of these infants had excretion apparent on scintiscans. Similarly, low hepatic indices occurred in four infants with liver dysfunction but pigmented stools, three of whom had no excretion apparent on scintiscans. These preliminary studies suggest that a hepatic index of greater than 5 is much more rapid and as specific in excluding atresia as repeated abdominal scintigraphy.\r"

The gastric tumor resembled a gastric leiomyosarcoma by light microscopy, but electron microscopy revealed it to be a gastric autonomic nerve (GAN) tumor. Based on this evidence it appears that both the gastric lesions and the paragangliomata of Carney's Triad are tumors of the autonomic nervous system. Thus, the Triad may be a disorder of the autonomic nervous system rather than a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome or multiple hamartoma syndrome.\r"

Despite the high incidence of preoperative jaundice (32%), no common duct stones were documented. There was no operative mortality. The complication rate was 45%. In 10 patients not operated upon, two patients died of liver failure and the remaining eight patients are alive 8 months to 13 years after diagnosis (mean: 46 months) with no active biliary disease. It is concluded that: jaundice in this subpopulation most often reflects hepatocellular injury and rarely biliary tract obstruction, there appears to be a much lower incidence of acute cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis in cirrhotic patients with cholelithiasis than in the normal population, and patients with cirrhosis and asymptomatic cholelithiasis can be safely managed without operation.\r"

After a follow-up period of 32 months, lasting pain relief was obtained in 10 patients; pseudocyst formation occurred in three patients; calcification of the distal pancreas, absent before operation, was demonstrated in four of six patients; six of 11 nondiabetic patients became hyperglycemic either abruptly (1 patient) or progressively (5 patients); quality of life improved in most patients. This procedure preserves the stomach, duodenum, spleen, distal pancreas and common bile duct if possible.

Patient age, length of surgery, and postoperative recovery seemed to predict better healing in patients who had appendectomy, but there was a difference in the preoperative illness of the two groups: acute cholecystitis was treated medically and cholecystectomy performed after resolution of the acute phase of illness, whereas patients who had appendectomy were taken to surgery as soon as a diagnosis was made. It was observed that patients who had appendectomy accumulated 20% less hydroxyproline than patients who had cholecystectomy (p less than 0.02), and that the depression of hydroxyproline accumulation was significantly related to length of preoperative illness (p = 0.008). This decrease in wound hydroxyproline accumulation is attributed to the acute preoperative illness. Conceptually, this is a unique situation since the brief illness did not produce lasting debility, and the source of illness, the inflamed appendix, was not present during healing. This indicates that even a brief preoperative illness has a more prolonged influence on postoperative healing than usually anticipated.\r"

Liver metastases were solitary in 44 patients, multiple in 36 patients, unilobar in 76 patients, and bilobar in 4 patients. Tumor size was less than 5 cm in 33 patients, 5-10 cm in 30 patients, and larger than 10 cm in 17 patients. There were 43 synchronous and 37 metachronous liver metastases with a delay of 2-70 months. The surgical procedures included more major liver resections (55 patients) than wedge resections (25 patients). Portal triad occlusion was used in most cases, and complete vascular exclusion of the liver was performed for resection of the larger tumors. In-hospital mortality rate was 5%. Three- and 5-year survival rates were 40.5% and 24.9%, respectively. None of the analysed criteria: size and number of liver metastases, delay after diagnosis of the primary cancer, Duke's stage, could differentiate long survivors from patients who did not benefit much from liver surgery due to early recurrence. Recurrences were observed in 51 patients during the study, two thirds occurring during the first year after liver surgery. Eight patients had resection of \"secondary\" metastases after a first liver resection: two patients for extrahepatic recurrences and six patients for liver recurrences. Encouraging results raise the question of how far agressive surgery for liver metastases should go.\r"

The median postoperative follow-up was 18 months (range: 4-45 months). Survival rate was calculated by the actuarial method, and statistical significance was tested by the Mantel-Haenszel test. Twenty-eight patients had a relapse. These recurrences were hepatic in 11 patients, extrahepatic (intra- and extra-abdominal) in 12 patients, and intra- and extrahepatic in five patients: The stage (classification of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan) was the most important parameter related to the overall recurrence rate (47% in stage I, 62% in stage II, and 81% in stage III) and to the overall and disease-free survival. Stage was significantly related to hepatic relapse but not to extrahepatic relapse. In stage I the failure rate of 18 months was similar in hepatic and extrahepatic relapses (one third to one fourth of the patients); in stages II and III the hepatic failure rate was always higher than the extrahepatic rate. These data indicate that surgery alone is an inadequate form of therapy in cases of colorectal cancer metastases of the liver, and an adjuvant therapy, including alternate regimens of intraperitoneal and systemic chemotherapy, should be considered.\r"

An insidious, occult illness marked by diagnostic delay, inadequate drainage, and considerable morbidity and mortality is common. Anatomic reviews detailing the complex extraperitoneal spaces have been published, but less attention has been focused on diagnostic and drainage techniques useful to the practicing surgeon. In a retrospective review of 50 extraperitoneal abscesses, attention was directed to clinical presentation, diagnosis, and therapy. On the average, 12.7 days were required to establish the diagnosis; 50% of patients suffered major complications. A strikingly high mortality was associated with positive blood cultures and persistent fever within 48 hours of drainage (75% and 71%, respectively). Computed tomography has greatly enhanced the diagnosis of extraperitoneal abscesses, and radiologic drainage in selected cases appears to be a useful initial approach. A simplified anatomic classification and treatment plan is proposed to facilitate comparison between clinical series.\r"

Two different double-ligation procedures were used for study of the time sequence of thrombus organization by the vascularized (in situ) and devascularized (dissected) walls of the external jugular vein and common carotid artery in 21 mongrel dogs. Blood in the ligated segments of the in situ veins remained mostly fluid. In these segments, intimal hyperplasia was observed after 4 weeks with apparent preservation of an endothelial lining. However, in the dissected veins, the trapped blood rapidly thrombosed. Remarkable cell proliferation quickly occurred in these dissected walls with rapid invasion of the thrombus to achieve complete organization by 4 weeks. In contrast, a thrombus formed in the ligated segments of all arteries, whether in situ or dissected, and organization was much slower, requiring about 4 months for completion. Full-wall viability was maintained in 100% of the in situ veins and in 95% of the devascularized veins, but inner wall viability was lost in 30% of the in situ arteries and in 95% of the devascularized arteries.\r"

  ".W": "Although emphasis has been placed on including content on treating the elderly in the medical school curriculum, little attention has been given to whether content on surgical management of the elderly should be provided in the surgical clerkship. The purpose of this paper is to describe geriatric principles emphasized in a surgical clerkship and changes in attitudes of students. Junior students (N = 175) were tested on attitudes before and after the clerkship. Attitudes about treating the elderly and surgery in the elderly changed significantly and positively. Attitudes about emergency surgery in the elderly became more realistic, particularly in those selecting surgery as a career. This study differs from others that found that students became more negative about treating the elderly as they progressed through medical school. The surgical clerkship provides a different perspective of the older patient from that seen on medicine or in long-term care, in that the elderly are usually admitted and treated successfully in a short time. The fact that the surgical clerkship, in contrast to other medical school experiences, can positively influence attitudes about aging for all students, regardless of career choice, is encouraging and suggests that including content on surgical management of the elderly can help students become more favorable about treating older patients.\r"

A typical peptic ulcer (Barrett's ulcer) may develop in the columnar-lined segment, although this is a rare occurrence. Between 1975 and 1985 at Toronto General Hospital we treated 11 patients with penetrating peptic ulcer and acquired, columnar-lined esophagus. Presenting symptoms related to the ulcer were precordial and lower dorsal back pain in 4 patients, dysphagia in 6, and massive hemorrhage of the upper gastrointestinal tract in 4. None of the ulcers healed following a trial of medical therapy, and ultimately all 11 patients underwent antireflux procedures (gastroplasty and partial fundoplication). There was one operative death. Complete healing of the ulcer was observed in the 8 patients who underwent follow-up endoscopy between two and five months after operation. There has been no recurrence of symptoms resulting from ulcer in subsequent follow-up, which extends from 1 to 11 years (mean, 5 years). Adenocarcinoma developed in the columnar-lined segment in 2 of the 11 patients, which was diagnosed at 32 and 91 months following operation, respectively.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine how hearts with valvar aortic stenosis without hypertrophy can maintain their oxygen supply/consumption balance with partial left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion. Open-chested, anesthetized dogs (n = 9) were subjected to mild valvar aortic stenosis and then to a reduction of LAD flow to 50% of baseline, while controls (n = 9) received partial LAD occlusion without aortic stenosis. Blood flows were determined before and after aortic stenosis and after LAD occlusion using radioactive microspheres. The hearts were then removed for microspectrophotometric analysis of regional venous and arterial oxygen saturation. Aortic stenosis resulted in a pressure gradient of approximately 50 mm Hg, representing mild aortic stenosis. Only a slight increase in myocardial blood flow was seen with aortic stenosis. Ischemia resulted in a significant drop in blood flow in control (40%) and aortic stenosis (55%) animals compared with their own preocclusion values. These ischemic region flows were not different from each other. Aortic stenosis itself did not alter oxygen extraction, although partial occlusion similarly increased extraction for all groups in the ischemic zone. The LAD occlusion resulted in a decreased oxygen consumption in the occluded region of all groups, with no differences noted between control and aortic stenosed animals. Thus, mild, acute aortic stenosis without hypertrophy does not appear to significantly increase the severity of an ischemic episode precipitated by partial LAD occlusion.\r"

Clinical reports suggest that injuries to the esophagus can cause changes in peripheral serum CK. This prospective study was designed to delineate whether esophageal dilation or major esophageal surgery would cause changes in serum CK and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes that might be consistent with the diagnosis of an AMI. Two groups of patients admitted to a coronary care unit were used as controls: patients with electrocardiographically proved AMI and those who had chest pain but who had AMI ruled out by sequential electrocardiograms. The coronary care unit patients had serum enzymes determined on admission, then every 8 hours for four samples, and then daily for 3 days. The surgical patients had determinations preoperatively, in recovery, every 8 hours for four samples, and daily for 5 days. The patients who had esophageal dilations had serum enzyme levels drawn before the procedure and every 8 hours for 2 days after dilation. Serum total CK and lactate dehydrogenase levels were determined by automated spectrophotometry. Isoenzyme levels were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The data suggest that small serum CK-MB bands that may be generated by esophageal surgery or dilation can be differentiated from those seen in AMI and that AMI can be confirmed by simultaneous analysis of serum lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes.\r"

They ranged in age from 4 to 20 years, and each had undergone valve replacement some time between February, 1982, and June, 1984. There was 1 hospital death (3.3%; 70% confidence limits [CL] = 0.4% to 10.9%). The 29 hospital survivors were treated with aspirin and dipyridamole. All patients were followed up. There were 5 late deaths (17.2%; 70% CL = 9% to 27%), at a mean of 8 months postoperatively. Follow-up revealed that 7 thromboembolic events occurred in 7 of the hospital survivors (24.1%; 70% CL = 15% to 35%). Hemiparesis occurred in 1 patient, and documented valve thrombosis and death occurred in another. Transient sensorimotor deficits were found in the 5 other patients. Prosthetic valve endocarditis developed in 1 hospital survivor (3.5%; 70% CL = 0.4% to 11%) and resulted in late death. There were no reoperations in the hospital survivors. We conclude that the St. Jude Medical prosthesis is useful for valve replacement in the young because of its low profile, durability, and hemodynamic characteristics. However, we recommend that these patients receive full anticoagulation therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics have been studied during the induction of brain death in the chacma baboon. In 11 animals brain death was induced by acute intracranial hypertension. Continuous recording of blood flow through both the pulmonary artery and the aorta was obtained by electromagnetic flow meters placed around these vessels. Mean arterial, central venous, pulmonary arterial, and left atrial pressures were recorded continuously. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were calculated. During the agonal period marked sympathetic activity occurred, with significant increases in circulating catecholamines and systemic vascular resistance. The great increase in systemic resistance resulted in acute left ventricular failure. Mean left atrial or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure rose above the mean pulmonary arterial pressure in 9 animals. As the systemic vascular resistance rose, a significant difference between pulmonary artery and aortic blood flows occurred, leading to blood pooling within the lungs. A mean of 72% of the total blood volume of the animal accumulated within these organs. The increase of left atrial pressure to levels higher than pulmonary artery pressure indicated a state of pulmonary capillary blood flow arrest. This, associated with the blood pooling within the lungs, almost certainly resulted in disruption of the anatomic integrity of the pulmonary capillaries (blast injury); 4 animals developed pulmonary edema, with alveolar septal interstitial hemorrhage.\r"

In the control group of 70 patients no attempt was made to shield the phrenic nerves from direct exposure to ice. Phrenic nerve damage occurred in 73% of these patients, as assessed by persistent diaphragm paralysis evident on inspiratory chest roentgenogram. In 2 patients the paralysis was bilateral. In the second group of 63 patients a pericardial insulation pad was used to prevent contact of the iced slush to the phrenic nerve. Diaphragm paralysis was observed in 17% of these patients. This difference was highly significant (p less than .001). Diaphragm paralysis in the control group was clinically significant; life-threatening respiratory complications developed in 7 patients (14%), frequently resulting in multiple reintubations, tracheostomy, and prolonged mechanical ventilation. In addition, 4 patients with phrenic nerve injury exhibited a clinical syndrome consistent with gastric ileus, which may possibly represent hypothermic injury to the thoracic vagi. The likelihood of phrenic nerve injury when iced saline slush is used for topical myocardial cooling and the possibility of developing serious respiratory disability would support the routine use of pericardial insulation when this method of hypothermia is used.\r"

Because of their negative inotropic effects, antiarrhythmic agents are not recommended for patients with low cardiac output syndrome. A device was developed that topically cools the right atrial surface for antiarrhythmic treatment. In experiments, this device lowered right atrial temperature and did not affect the temperature of the right ventricle or the whole body. When right atrial temperature decreased from 37 degrees to 28 degrees C, heart rate was reduced from 146.3 to 109.7 beats per minute (p less than .001). Meanwhile, cardiac output and blood pressure remained within control levels. In the treatment of experimental SVT induced by the intravenous infusion of isoproterenol hydrochloride and by direct application of aconitine, this method worked effectively and was reproducible. The results demonstrated the beneficial effects of this method in the treatment of SVT in experimental studies and suggested its future clinical application following open-heart operations.\r"

In 11 patients who received 10 mg of isosorbide dinitrate, blood pressure (BP) dropped from 205 +/- 8/131 +/- 3 to 166 +/- 9/106 +/- 5 mm Hg at 120 minutes. In eight patients who received placebo, BP dropped from 203 +/- 8/130 +/- 3 to 193 +/- 11/122 +/- 5 mm Hg at 120 minutes. When 10 mg of isosorbide dinitrate was administered sublingually after 120 minutes to placebo-pretreated patients, their BP dropped to 161 +/- 7/105 +/- 6 mm Hg at 240 minutes. Our study group (19 patients) was compared with a \"control\" group (six patients) whose BP (203 +/- 12/132 +/- 8 mm Hg) was treated only with conventional antihypertensive medications and bed rest; five (83%) of the six controls achieved steady BP control at 24 hours vs nine (47%) of the 19 study patients pretreated with isosorbide. There were no side effects, including hypotension, orthostatic effect, and reflex tachycardia. Sublingual isosorbide safely and effectively lowers systolic and diastolic BP in patients with severe, uncontrolled arterial hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Serum cobalamin (vitamin B12) levels were analyzed retrospectively in 17 patients with primary degenerative dementia and 11 with specific demonstrable causes of dementia (secondary dementia). The prevalence of low cobalamin levels was significantly increased in primary dementia (29% vs 0% in secondary dementia). Because typical findings of deficiency often seemed absent, we prospectively studied two other patients with primary dementia and low cobalamin levels. Neither of these two had megaloblastic anemia; one had a normal Schilling test while the other's was borderline. Despite this absence of the expected findings, the deoxyuridine suppression test gave biochemical evidence of cobalamin deficiency in both cases. Our survey of 28 patients thus established that low serum cobalamin levels are frequent in primary dementia. Our findings in the two prospectively studied cases (as well as in some of the patients in the survey) indicate that these levels are associated in at least some cases with an atypical deficiency state rather than with disorders such as pernicious anemia. Such atypical deficiency states cannot be identified by classic hematological criteria or by the Schilling test.\r"

Eight (32%) of 25 patients had a decrease of greater than 2 s. The decrease in prothrombin time correlated poorly with heparin dose or activated partial thromboplastin time in patients taking heparin.

Seventy-eight percent were found to have abnormal renal biopsy results and were divisible into two patient groups: those with IgA nephropathy (49%, 32/65) and those with multiple nonspecific abnormalities (29%, 19/65). Ancillary testing, demographic data, and clinical data, other than abnormal amounts of proteinuria, were not distinguishable between these groups and patients with normal renal biopsy results (22%, 14/65). Etiologic differentiation of the hematuria was possible only by renal biopsy. At present, renal biopsy in this group of patients makes no difference therapeutically or, probably, prognostically. It should not, therefore, be considered necessary for routine management of asymptomatic hematuria.\r"

Since all subjects with micronodular hyperplasia and/or cardiac myxomas also had mucocutaneous lentigines, the skin lesions were markers for affected subjects. This family is one of the larger reported with this syndrome. Of special note was the finding of rare visceral tumors in affected family members, including melanocytic schwannomas and a fibrolamellar hepatoma, signaling another feature of the syndrome. Since 60% of this family encompassing three contiguous generations were affected, the syndrome appears to be inherited as an autosomal or X-linked dominant gene.\r"

In patients with a central tumor, the sensitivity was 93%, the specificity 74%, and the accuracy 83%. In patients with a peripheral tumor, the respective percentages were 55%, 82%, and 77%. Only 11 of 66 patients with a peripheral tumor had mediastinal metastases, and five of these patients had a normal CT scan. Conversely, 43 of 64 patients with a central tumor and mediastinal lymph node enlargement on the CT scan had unresectable disease, compared with only one of 44 patients without such enlargement. We conclude that CT is not useful in the evaluation of patients with a peripheral tumor; however, it is useful in determining which patients with a central tumor do not require a surgical staging procedure prior to thoracotomy.\r"

Hypokalemia, often in the absence of diuretic use, occurred in 17% of the 211 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Patients with acute myocardial infarction and a potassium level of less than 4.0 mEq/L (4.0 mmol/L) had an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias (59% vs 42%). Because hypokalemia is common in acute myocardial infarction and is associated with ventricular arrhythmias, routine measurement of serum potassium levels and prompt correction are recommended. Hypomagnesemia occurred in only 4% of the patients, but it was more common in the group with acute myocardial infarction than in the group without myocardial infarction (6% vs 3%). Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in ten of the 13 patients with both acute myocardial infarction and hypomagnesemia, but eight of these patients also had low serum potassium levels. This low incidence of hypomagnesemia does not justify routine measurement of serum magnesium levels. However, the mean level (2.5 +/- 0.4 mg/dL [1.03 +/- 0.16 mmol/L]) in a reference population of healthy volunteers was unexpectedly high and suggests that the low incidence of hypomagnesemia in our population may not be applicable to other centers and may reflect a higher magnesium content in our geographic area of southeastern Ontario.\r"

Two race-matched control groups consisted of 37 patients with lung fibrosis due to chronic extrinsic allergic alveolitis (group 2) and 162 healthy volunteers (group 3). The study further included a kinship with progressive sarcoidosis. The frequency of HLA-DR5 was significantly increased only in group 1 (relative risk, 6.6). HLA-DR5 was found in 38 patients (52%) in group 1, compared with five (14%) in group 2 and 23 (14%) in group 3. In the one family studied, HLA-DR5 was present only in one member, who had sarcoidosis. This study supports the hypothesis that the role of an infectious agent triggering sarcoidosis cannot be envisaged without considering genetically linked cofactors.\r"

With clinical judgment alone, physicians and nurses correctly identify severe impairment, but the more prevalent moderate impairments in mental status, nutrition, vision, and continence are poorly recognized. Comprehensive functional assessment instruments can detect these moderate impairments, which may be remediable through early intervention.\r"

The absolute number of T8 cells, but not T4 cells, increased three to four weeks after the procedure in eight of the 15 subjects. This increase in T8 cells was associated with clinical improvement in some cases and increased T-cell responsiveness in vitro. Thymic tissue transplantation as a single therapeutic maneuver is unlikely to reconstitute the immune system of patients with AIDS, but the potential of the approach, used in combination with agents that block replication of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III, deserves further study.\r"

The mean age of these 14 patients was 63 years (range, 27 to 84 years); there were eight men and six women. In 11 patients, there was a history and/or findings of peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Two patients had prior surgery (Billroth II in one and vagotomy in another). Seven patients had diabetes mellitus; five had diabetes for over five years, and three of these five had diabetes for over ten years. Diabetes was newly diagnosed in one patient. Except for the newly diagnosed patient, the other diabetic patients had evidence of autonomic neuropathy. Two other patients (not included with the diabetic patients) had hyperglycemia only during stress. The three patients with bezoars but without PUD all had diabetes for many years (9, 17, and 19 years). In two control groups of 14 patients each who also underwent endoscopy, only one diabetic patient was discovered. We conclude that diabetes mellitus and associated gastropathy are major risk factors for bezoar formation, especially in the absence of PUD.\r"

Total serum amylase activity, lipase activity, isoamylase fractionation, and lipase concentration were used to measure pancreatic enzymes. Amylase activity was increased in 35 of 43 patients with CRF but was greater than threefold elevated in only three. Pancreatic isoamylase activity was greater than 80% in only one patient with CRF but was greater than 80% in all three patients with pancreatitis receiving CAPD. Lipase activity was increased in 26 patients and lipase concentration was elevated in 27. Peritoneal fluid from three patients with pancreatitis receiving CAPD contained high levels of amylase. Serum amylase and lipase are frequently elevated in patients with CRF in the absence of clinical pancreatitis. However, serum amylase activity greater than threefold elevated or the presence of pancreatic enzymes in the peritoneal fluid may suggest coexistent pancreatitis.\r"

  ".U": "87155658\r", 
  ".W": "The 1960s epidemic of asthma deaths that affected young persons in England and Wales, as well as in other countries, was attributed to the effect of newly available pressurized aerosols containing sympathomimetic bronchodilators. The subsequent decision to ban the nonprescription sale of these agents in the United Kingdom represented a unique use of national and international mortality data. The application of such data for decisions about therapeutic agents has implications for the current rise of asthma deaths in New Zealand, for the recent United States regulatory action regarding the nonprescription sale of aerosolized bronchodilators, and for the appraisal of adverse reactions to other pharmaceutical substances. This article is concerned with the quality of the scientific evidence used to implicate bronchodilators in the 1960s epidemic, and also with the strengths and weaknesses of the ecologic studies on which the implication depended. After concluding that the causal link between asthma deaths and bronchodilators was not supported by satisfactory scientific evidence, we present new data and an alternative diagnostic-exchange hypothesis that may, in part, help explain the original association.\r"

This report describes three patients who developed profound hypotension after acute treatment of hypertension with the usual doses of nifedipine. A review of the literature reveals no previous reports of symptomatic hypotension from the use of nifedipine alone in this setting. Clinicians should be aware of this potentially life-threatening toxicity and titrate doses and monitor patients accordingly.\r"

Two thrombi were pendulous with free motion during the cardiac contractions; one of these consisted of two separated pendulous clots that disappeared after two episodes of embolization six and 16 days, respectively, after the onset of AMI. Two thrombi were initially broad based, flat, and without intracavitary motion. One thrombus caused two episodes of peripheral emboli; the other began as a flat thrombus without intracavitary motion but progressed to show central echolucency and, then, vigorous intracavitary motion of the margin prior to embolization. Five of six embolic episodes occurred when these patients were receiving high-dose anticoagulants. These anticoagulants were administered once the thrombi were diagnosed. Left ventricular thrombi of very different appearance on 2-D echocardiography may cause embolization, which may occur during therapeutic anticoagulation administered after thrombi have developed in patients with AMI.\r"

Among men grouped into quartiles by their level of uric acid at baseline, the upper quartile (average uric acid, 7.7 mg/dL [458 mumol/L]) had an average serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL (106 mumol/L) and the lowest quartile (uric acid, 4.9 mg/dL [291 mumol/L]) had an average serum creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL (97 mumol/L). Similar findings were present in women. Therapy with chlorthalidone or other thiazide-type diuretics tended to increase levels of uric acid and creatinine, but the increase in both was less in the upper quartile than in the lower quartile. Among individuals who were prescribed uric acid-lowering drugs, the level of serum creatinine increased just as much as in those whose uric acid level was not pharmacologically lowered. Baseline uric acid level was a weak predictor of mortality in men; the introduction of an interaction term for creatinine suggested that this effect was primarily restricted to those with elevated levels of both uric acid and creatinine at baseline. Change in uric acid level at one year after therapy was inversely correlated with mortality in men. There were few episodes of gout (only 15 recorded in five years among 3693 participants at risk). These results suggest that neither the baseline uric acid level nor the change in uric acid level produced by therapy injures the kidney. These results suggest no reason to lower uric acid levels pharmacologically in the treated hypertensive patient who is not gouty. They leave unanswered whether there is a predictive value to baseline uric acid level not explainable by other correlated cardiovascular risk factors.\r"

The development of vasculitis was not related to a variant of HCL on the basis of hematologic findings and survival. Vasculitis could occur at any time during the course of HCL, and was the circumstance for the diagnosis of HCL in three cases. Clinical and immunohistologic findings were those of hypersensitivity vasculitis in the nine patients. Infection was found to be an associated factor. Thus, eight of nine patients were infected at vasculitis onset, four died of their infection with no remittance of the cutaneous lesions, and three recovered from both infection and vasculitis. The monocyte deficiency in HCL is known to favor intracellular pathogen infection; however, we could not demonstrate that it also correlates with a decrease in the clearance of IgG-sensitized erythrocytes. Finally, vasculitis in HCL appears to be associated with a lasting infection in most cases.\r"

To develop a management strategy for patients with unexplained fever, we studied 880 adults who were evaluated for acute fever in an emergency room. At presentation, 135 (15%) patients had unexplained fever. Occult bacterial infection was found in 48 (35%) of these 135 patients, and 21 (44%) of 48 infected patients had bacteremia. Four bacteremic patients were incorrectly discharged from the emergency room without antimicrobial therapy. Neither a \"toxic\" appearance of the patient nor an initial temperature of greater than or equal to 39.4 degrees C (103 degrees F) were predictive of occult bacterial infection. An index of predictive features was developed that included: age 50 years or older; diabetes mellitus; a white blood cell count greater than or equal to 15,000/mm3 (15 X 10(9)/L); a neutrophil band cell count greater than or equal to 1500/mm3 (1.5 X 10(9)/L); and a Wintrobe erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than or equal to 30 mm/h. In patients with 0, 1, 2, or 3 or more index features present, the proportions having occult bacterial infection were 5% (1/21), 33% (15/45), 39% (15/38), and 55% (17/31), respectively. All four bacteremic patients incorrectly discharged had two or more of the index features. Adults presenting with acute unexplained fever often have life-threatening bacterial infection. A simple clinical index can be used to estimate the likelihood of occult infection and may reduce the frequency of diagnostic error.\r"

Detailed endocrine investigations were performed, including ovarian biopsy in the propositus. HLA genotype A2 was present in each patient. The normal high-resolution prometaphase karyotypes indicated heterogeneity; the absence of the deletion 15q12 frequently found in patients with sporadic PWS distinguished this sibship as representing a possible autosomal recessive type of PWS. Current evidence suggests that the diagnosis of PWS may be often overlooked. Increased clinical awareness of the features of PWS should result in prompt diagnosis and optimal management of affected patients, together with increased understanding of this enigmatic condition.\r"

Recent reports have indicated that deflazacort is less diabetogenic than prednisone in healthy subjects. Ten insulin-treated diabetics who required steroid drugs were treated with deflazacort (30 mg/d for four weeks) and prednisone (25 mg/d for four weeks) in randomized, double-blind design after a pretreatment period of four weeks. At the end of each treatment, plasma glucose profile (five determinations per day), hemoglobin A1 level, and insulin requirements were compared. Mean (+/- SEM) plasma glucose level (139 +/- 28 vs 169 +/- 32 mg/dL [7.7 +/- 1.5 vs 9.4 +/- 1.8 mmol/L]) and hemoglobin A1 values (8.81% +/- 1.19% vs 10.71% +/- 1.17% of total hemoglobin) were significantly lower after deflazacort than after prednisone. Also, insulin requirement was significantly lower after deflazacort than after prednisone (29.3 +/- 11.6 vs 47.3 +/- 2.0 U/d). These results indicate that deflazacort, when employed in an anti-inflammatory dose equivalent to prednisone, should prove advantageous in insulin-treated diabetics who require steroid treatment.\r"

There was no change in the plasma parathyroid hormone concentrations. The forearm mineral density before treatment was low in 16 of the 20 patients and there was a significant increase in forearm mineral density after norethindrone treatment.

Lowering of plasma lipid values toward normal was achieved in all patients following a program of combined dietary and drug (bezafibrate) therapy. Five patients had recurrent episodes of pancreatitis during the treatment program. These patients were diagnosed subsequently as suffering from bulimia and were all given cognitive behavioral therapy. One patient died following an attack of pancreatitis. An underlying eating disorder should be suspected in patients who relapse after treatment for pancreatitis and hyperlipidemia. Multidisciplinary treatment should be used in these patients to improve therapeutic efficacy and uncover behavioral patterns that have a direct impact on their life expectancy.\r"

Within 30 minutes after albuterol administration, serum potassium level dropped from 5.6 +/- 0.2 (+/- SEM) to 4.5 +/- 0.2 mEq/L (5.6 +/- 0.2 to 4.5 +/- 0.2 mmol/L). There were no changes in plasma aldosterone levels or arterial pH, but blood glucose and serum insulin levels increased. Albuterol, however, induced similar decreases in serum potassium levels in three diabetic patients while free C peptide levels remained undetectable or subnormal after administration of the drug. Albuterol sulfate alone (0.5 mg intravenously) was also used to treat 24 patients with acute or chronic renal failure and hyperkalemia. Their serum potassium levels dropped from 7 +/- 0.2 mEq/L (7 +/- 0.2 mmol/L) to 5.6 +/- 0.2 mEq/L (5.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/L), 5.6 +/- 0.2 mEq/L (5.6 +/- 0.2 mmol/L), 6 +/- 0.2 mEq/L (6 +/- 0.2 mmol/L), and 6.2 +/- 0.2 mEq/L (6.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/L) at 30, 60, 180, and 360 minutes after receiving albuterol, respectively, and this was accompanied by reversal of the electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalemia. Despite inducing transient tachycardia, albuterol was remarkably well tolerated and no serious side effects were observed. beta 2-adrenergic stimulation of intracellular potassium uptake by albuterol is a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of hyperkalemia in renal failure.\r"

Audibility scores were compared with phonocardiographic, echocardiographic, and hemodynamic measurements. An S4 was recorded graphically in 35 (68.6%) of all 51 subjects and splitting of the first sound (S1), in 37 subjects (72.5%). The abnormal group did not differ significantly from the normal subjects in incidence of recordable S4 or splitting of S1. Audibility of S4, however, correlated with its recorded amplitude, size, and palpability of the presystolic apical impulse, left ventricular systolic and diastolic diameters, and history of myocardial infarction. Despite variation among examiners, house staff officers were likelier than cardiologists to believe an S4 present even in cases lacking a recordable S4 and in normal subjects and were more apt to believe an S4 present when splitting of S1 was identified graphically. We conclude that an audible S4 continues to provide evidence for cardiac disease, and that increasing examiner experience renders this finding fairly specific. Less experienced examiners are likelier to confuse splitting of S1 with the S4, suggesting that training should be focused on means to improve this differentiation.\r"

Control studies in the same group of patients had shown chronic persistence of lesions without spontaneous improvement in most cases. Two patients had been treated with praziquantel previously with partial response; in both cases albendazole therapy was effective with 100% and 77% improvement.

No relationship between the serum concentrations and the severity of toxic effect was seen. Metabolic abnormalities similar to those previously reported in intentional acute intoxication were noted. Cardiac arrhythmias were seen in approximately half of the patients, hypotension in only one. No patient in whom a conservative form of therapy was initiated at diagnosis went on to develop additional toxic effects. It is our finding that severe toxic reactions to theophylline can occur over a wide range of serum concentrations. Conservative treatment measures, specifically drug discontinuation and interference with additional oral absorption by activated charcoal, should be instituted unless life-threatening symptoms are present, when more aggressive therapy (such as charcoal hemoperfusion) is warranted.\r"

Because parathyroid hormone secretion is regulated by extracellular calcium concentration and because abnormalities in transmembrane calcium transport are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of MyD, the concurrence of these rather rare disorders in two patients raises the possibility that abnormalities in transmembrane calcium transport may underlie the development of primary hyperparathyroidism in patients with MyD. Although further studies are needed to clarify the possible link between these two disorders, the present study emphasizes the importance of evaluation of parathyroid function in patients with MyD.\r"

During hemodialysis, serum propylthiouracil levels were normal, and the time to peak serum levels was delayed; the disappearance of the drug from the serum was normal after hemodialysis was completed. The amount of propylthiouracil that appeared in the dialysate was approximately 5% of the administered dose.

There were significant, strongly positive correlations between cortisol secretory responses to cosyntropin and postdexamethasone cortisol concentrations in patients with MDD. These findings confirm that adrenal sensitivity to corticotropin (ACTH) is enhanced in MDD and suggest that this endocrine abnormality may be related pathophysiologically to the resistance of cortisol secretion to dexamethasone suppression.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) monoamine metabolite levels were studied in 20 arsonists, 20 habitually violent offenders, and ten healthy inpatient volunteers. The arsonists and violent offenders had been in prison an average of six months before the study. Both the raw data and data adjusted by analysis of covariance for group differences in age, height, sex, and season of the lumbar puncture showed significantly lower concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the arsonists than in the other groups. The finding remained the same when arsonists with violent suicide attempts were excluded from the analysis. Although CSF concentrations of MHPG or 5-HIAA did not correlate with the severity of repeated fire-setting behavior, low blood glucose nadir in the oral glucose tolerance test (a measure of the tendency toward hypoglycemia) did. These results support the hypothesis that poor impulse control in criminal offenders is associated with low levels of certain CSF monoamine metabolites and with a hypoglycemic tendency.\r"

This prospective study compared the risk of cardiovascular complication at therapeutic plasma concentrations of TCAs in 196 depressed patients, 155 with normal electrocardiograms and 41 with either prolonged PR interval and/or bundle-branch block. The prevalence of second-degree atrioventricular block was significantly greater in patients with preexisting bundle-branch block (9%) than in patients with normal electrocardiograms (0.7%).

Cocaine abuse had only minimally declined during the follow-up period despite treatment, and the number of opioid addicts with at least weekly cocaine abuse had doubled. The clear effect of methadone maintenance treatment in reducing opioid abuse was not evident for cocaine abuse. During the follow-up period, more cocaine use was reported by the methadone-treated subjects than by those undergoing detoxification only. Prognostically, cocaine users were more likely to be nonwhites and men. Subjects who increased their cocaine use during the follow-up period were more likely to have depressive disorders and more likely to be found among methadone- and \"drug-free\"-treated subjects than among detoxification subjects. Thus, among methadone- and drug-free-treated subjects, depression appeared to be a risk factor for escalating cocaine abuse; this risk factor may benefit from specific interventions.\r"

The grains had attached to multinucleated macrophages, many of which contained clusters of cocci in their cytoplasm. It is postulated that the cocci were able to survive and probably replicate in the cytoplasm of multinucleated macrophages, and were subsequently extruded as grains. These observations suggest a defect in intracellular killing of cocci by the monocyte-macrophage system. This may relate to failure in induction of control of macrophage activity by T4-inducer subsets.\r"

  ".W": "The pathologic diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) rests on the gross cardiac morphology and the presence and extent of myofiber disarray in the interventricular septum. Little attention, however, has been focused on the features of HCM in endomyocardial biopsy or septal myomectomy specimens. We therefore examined nine right ventricular biopsy specimens and 89 myomectomy specimens from 98 patients with clinically diagnosed HCM. Myofiber disarray was present in three (33%) of the biopsy specimens and 52 (58%) of the septectomy specimens. Associated findings in both specimen types included myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. The myomectomy specimens also frequently contained areas of patchy fibrosis, abnormally thick coronary arteries, and a fibrous endocardial plaque. When myofiber disarray was present in myomectomy specimens, it was confined to the deepest portion in 79% of the specimens, confirming that the disarray is frequently confined to the middle transverse third of the septum. Endomyocardial biopsy specimens may be used to suggest the diagnosis of HCM; however, because of their small size and their relatively nonspecific pathologic changes, they are of limited value in making the diagnosis of HCM. Septal myomectomy specimens usually contain pathologic findings consistent with HCM. The role of the surgical pathologist in the myomectomy cases is to confirm that these changes are present and are characteristic of the disorder.\r"

In two of these three cases, myocardial emboli occurred in the systemic (coronary) circulation. The source of emboli was attributed to postinfarction ruptured ventricular septum in one patient, and to traumatized myocardium during surgical reconstruction of a univentricular heart (single ventricle) in the other. In the third case, myocardial emboli occurred in the pulmonary circulation, originating from excavation of the infundibulum at surgical correction of pulmonary atresia. A literature search has uncovered only five previously reported cases of myocardium as emboli, all occurring in the systemic circulation. To my knowledge, there has not been any previous report of myocardial emboli in the pulmonary circulation.\r"

In addition, we correlated immunoreactivity with a spectrum of the following histologic categories: normal aorta, fatty streak, atheromatous plaque, and fibrous plaque. Using appropriate controls, we confirmed CRP immunoreactivity in 3.3% of normal specimens, 75% of fatty streaks, 90.2% of atheromatous plaques, and 64.6% of fibrous plaques. Immunoreactivity in fatty streaks was located around collections of foam cells. Immunoreactivity in atheromatous plaques was in a bandlike distribution corresponding to the pale-staining insudative zone frequently seen in such lesions. The correlation and localization of CRP immunoreactivity in atherosclerotic lesions presented here suggests a functional role for CRP in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Our results encourage efforts to determine more precisely the physiologic contributions of CRP to the development and exacerbation of atherosclerosis.\r"

Peanut lectin binds to B-D-galactose (1-3) N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, which is the purported determinant for the T-blood-group antigen and the immediate precursor of the MN-blood-group glycoprotein. In the normal colon, PNA binds to the supranuclear (SN) portion of goblet and columnar cells, representing nascent glycoproteins in the Golgi apparatus prior to the addition of terminal sialic acid. In severely active UC, PNA binds to the glycocalyx and/or apical portion of columnar cells, crypt goblet cells, and the total cytoplasm of \"regenerating or hyperplastic\" epithelium. These patterns have been previously reported in colonic cancers, adenomas, and fetal colons, indicating the synthesis of incomplete glycoproteins. Cases of inactive UC and mildly active UC expressed PNA binding in an SN distribution similar to controls. Cases with dysplasia showed PNA binding patterns similar to colonic neoplasms. In UC, the perturbation of cell kinetics similar to colonic neoplasms and the more rapid cell migration and turnover may be reflected as synthesis of incomplete glycoproteins, as expressed by abnormal PNA binding patterns. These findings indicate that the epithelial cells in patients with severely active UC synthesize incomplete glycoproteins similar to colonic neoplasms; however, this abnormal glycoprotein pattern is reversible when inflammation is more quiescent.\r"

These zones were characterized histologically by discrete, well-formed villi lined by epithelium with prominent regenerative changes. Occasionally, the epithelium demonstrated an oncocytic appearance that may be the result of adaptive mitochondrial hyperplasia. Distinguishing villous regeneration from epithelial dysplasia may be difficult because several features, including cytologic atypia, dystrophic goblet cells, and a villous configuration, can be seen in both. However, close attention to the nuclear changes and the type of mucous differentiation will aid in the distinction.\r"

Recently, staining for milk-fat globule (MFG) protein has been suggested as a useful diagnostic test for this separation, but subsequent reports have been conflicting, with some authors finding clearcut differences, while others showed similar marking of both tumor types. To examine this technique further, we studied lung carcinomas and mesotheliomas with commercially available anti-MFG, and compared these results with those obtained with anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a commonly used immunomarker of carcinoma. We found that carcinomas showed strong cytoplasmic staining for MFG and CEA; however, a greater percentage of carcinomas were more strongly positive for CEA than for MFG. Mesotheliomas did not, for the most part, stain strongly with either antibody. In addition, carcinomas from different hospitals stained differently for MFG, but not for CEA. We conclude that although strong cytoplasmic staining for MFG is a reasonably reliable indicator of carcinoma, CEA staining provides a better separation and is considerably easier to interpret in lung cancer specimens.\r"

The cytologic features of three such neoplasms are presented, and the characteristics that differentiate them from other benign and malignant lesions of the skin are discussed. The presence of two cell populations, the anucleated shadow cells and the basaloid cells, which lack nuclear features of malignancy, is fairly specific for pilomatrixoma. In addition, the specimens obtained from aspiration may be misinterpreted as originating from a hyperplastic lymph node in view of the intense chronic inflammatory and foreign body reaction seen in the background. Calcific deposits that lack lamellations, unlike psammoma bodies, help in establishing the definitive diagnosis of these benign neoplasms.\r"

The discrepancy appears to be due to changes in the internal viscosity of red blood cells and can be eliminated in the most popular line of automated whole blood analyzers (Coulter Counters) by use of a simple correction table. Fresh blood obtained from volunteers was separated by centrifugation into fractions of increasing mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. A correction table for hematocrit values obtained by automated equipment was derived from the linear relationship between the discrepancy in hematocrit values and the manually obtained values for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. With the use of the correction table, an average of three randomly selected fresh blood samples is sufficient to transfer a centrifugally determined hematocrit value to a multichannel analyzer with a coefficient of variation of 1.5%. Thus, this straightforward approach permits the microhematocrit to function as a practical calibration standard.\r"

Histologically, the adenomyoma, characterized by lobules of ducts and ductules with interlacing bundles of smooth muscle, was similar to the adenoleiomyomatous hamartoma of the intestines and to lesions of the gallbladder or extrahepatic ducts known as adenomyomas or adenomyomatous hyperplasia. The presumed rapid recent growth of the present lesion, as roentgenographically documented by the recent onset of dilatation of the common bile duct in an elderly woman, as well as the lack of gallstones or inflammatory disease of the biliary tract, might support the contention that the present lesion was neoplastic. On the other hand, the possibility that the lesion represents a hamartoma or diverticulosis of the saccules of Beale cannot be excluded.\r"

  ".W": "Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were used to monitor eight neurosurgical procedures involving posterior fossa tumors to assist the neurosurgeon in preservation of hearing postoperatively. The technique included placement of recording electrodes over the Cz (vertex) and both earlobes. Stimulation was accomplished intraoperatively with a specifically designed intraauricular click stimulator that did not interfere with surgical access to the suboccipital region. Continuous BAEP recording was performed with particular attention to the sequence of preincision, opening of the dura, tumor mobilization, tumor excision, and closure. Absolute latencies and interpeak latencies of all five waves were recorded when possible. In three patients BAEPs were not significantly altered intraoperatively, and hearing was preserved postoperatively. In another three patients the acoustic nerve was severed during surgery and intraoperative monitoring was discontinued. In the remaining two patients medical complications arose intraoperatively, and significant irreversible changes in BAEP were observed despite no gross anatomical damage to the acoustic nerve. Both of these patients experienced postoperative hearing loss. These two cases illustrated some of the BAEP abnormalities that occurred during surgery. Difficulties during the procedures included electrical noise and interference, use of a bipolar cautery device, and unclear wave forms. Solutions for these difficulties were braiding the electrodes and using extra ground electrodes and a spike suppressor; switching off the evoked potential equipment when the bipolar cautery device was in use; and increasing repetitions and changing click intensity and polarity, respectively. Monitoring BAEPs in posterior fossa surgery can be accomplished with presently available equipment and may aid the neurosurgeon in preserving or minimizing injury to auditory pathways and adjacent structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the evaluation was to determine whether symmetry was present in their legs and whether deficits in flexibility or strength would affect the susceptibility to hamstring or groin muscle strain injuries. The mean (+/- SE) flexibility of the dominant leg for hip abduction was 41 degrees +/- 1.2 degree; for hip flexion, 76 degrees +/- 1.9 degree; for hip extension, 174 degrees +/- 0.7 degree; and for ankle dorsiflexion, 33 degrees +/- 1.3 degree. The mean (+/- SE) isokinetic torque of the dominant leg (tested at 30 degrees per second) for knee extension was 214 +/- 8 newton meters and for flexion was 128 +/- 4 newton meters, while isometric strength for hip flexion was 315 +/- 8 newtons and for ankle plantar flexion was 1721 +/- 58 newtons. No significant differences were found between the dominant and nondominant legs in flexibility or strength. During this study no hamstring or groin strain injuries occurred. The lack of leg muscle strain injuries appeared to be directly related to the initiation of a controlled warmup and stretching program and underlines the importance of this in injury prevention. Interestingly, more than 50% (13 of 25) of the players were found to have significant deficits in one or more specific muscle groups. Two athletes sustained low back strain injuries and one athlete had a knee sprain injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The corresponding deterioration of upper extremity strength and functional capability with increasing age and the relationship between average strength and function were evaluated in 28 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Manual muscle testing (MMT) was used to evaluate strength and the Brooke upper extremity grading scale to rate upper extremity function. Mean MMT was found to relate to age in logarithmic fastion, ie, a 1% increase in age led to a 0.9% decrease in mean MMT. Functional grade (FG) related to age in a more complex fashion, revealing three groups based on age: under age 10, all in FG 1; between ages 10 and 13, concentration in FG 2 through 4; and over age 13, eight of ten in FG 5. Regression analysis did not contribute further useful information. Finally, mean MMT was found to be highly significantly related to FG. The plot of mean MMT against FG revealed an S-shaped curve, with rapidly rising functional grade once an average upper extremity strength of 4w was reached. The Brooke scale appears to be useful in describing upper extremity function among DMD patients, although it may reflect a three-grade rather than a six-grade discrimination capability. In describing the natural history of DMD, this scale demonstrates a pattern of rapid functional deterioration during the early adolescent years. This functional deterioration apparently takes place when the decline in strength reaches a threshold which cannot be compensated by muscle substitutions. At that time function deteriorates along a relatively rapid but undefined course.\r"

The static strength of ten different muscle groups had been measured bilaterally in patients (n = 24 to 58, depending on the muscle group), using a hand-held dynamometer. Strength deficits were calculated in relation to the nonparetic side of the body. Zero order correlations were calculated for strength deficit and time variables. Only the relationships between the strength deficits of the initial and discharge assessments were significant (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that the strength deficits of an initial assessment are the best predictors of strength deficits at discharge. This finding has implications for clinicians in clinical decision-making and in addressing patient expectations.\r"

Calcaneal bone density was measured using the Compton gamma ray scattering technique, which permits examination of trabecular bone. Predicted densities were determined from the ages and weights of the subjects. Descriptive factors such as gender, diagnosis, duration of the condition, and muscle tone were correlated with bone density. Twenty-eight patients (57%) had indications of reduced calcaneal bone density. None of the descriptive factors was associated with the variability in bone density ratio (forward stepwise regression analysis, p = NS). The reduced calcaneal density found in these patients with restricted mobility is probably a result of their not bearing weight and the inevitable severe reduction in their physical activity.\r"

NCV and EI were measured before, during (5, 10, and 15 sec) and three minutes after magnetic exposure. Both NCV and EI were measured on median nerve in all ten subjects, the peroneal nerve in seven subjects, while the ulnar nerve was measured for only EI in eight subjects. There was no significant change in NCV over the segment exposed to the magnetic field. However, EI was significantly increased during the magnetic exposure in all three nerves. The effects were observed as early as five seconds after exposure and disappeared by three minutes after exposure. It is concluded that the excitability of the motor nerve is increased when it is exposed to an SMF with a density of 1T.\r"

GXT followed a modified Bruce protocol without multiples of resting energy expenditure (MET) restrictions and a target heart rate (HR) of 90% of age-predicted maximal HR. The decision as to precisely when to administer the GXT after surgery was made on an individual case basis by the cardiovascular surgeon and the attending cardiologist. For the data analysis, patients were grouped according to the number of days the GXT was administered after surgery: group 1, 7 to 14 days (n = 164); group 2, 15 to 28 days (n = 46); and group 3, greater than 28 days (n = 17). The use of beta blockers was also determined on an individual case basis by the attending cardiologist rather than on a random basis. Ninety-seven of the 227 patients were on beta blockers. Ventricular ectopic activity (VEA), ST-segment changes (STTC), peak HR, peak systolic blood pressure (SBP), peak rate-pressure product (RPP), and peak METs were assessed during exercise. No major complications occurred during testing. Approximately two thirds (67.4%) of the tests were terminated voluntarily by the patient, and 22.5% were stopped by the attending physician. Only 10.1% of the subjects reached the target HR. Chi-square analysis failed to reveal any association between time of testing after surgery and either STTC or VEA. Analysis of variance failed to reveal any effects of group or beta blocker on peak METs attained during GXT; however, patients not using beta blocker medication attained higher peak HR, SBP, and RPP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Similarly, 92% (33/36) of patients treated with AFP improved clinically. There were no operative deaths in either group or significant difference in the rate of major complications. During the follow-up period, symptoms recurred in nine PTA patients (36%) due to progressive (five patients) or recurrent (four patients) disease within the iliac vessels. Late failure of AFB (8%) was significantly less frequent. While both PTA and AFB provide satisfactory initial relief of ischemic symptoms due to iliac atherosclerosis, long-term results of PTA are limited by progressive or recurrent disease in the iliac vessels.\r"

A retrospective analysis of all patients with gastric cancer (1972 through 1985) was performed to determine the frequency and most efficacious diagnostic modalities in this group of patients. Early gastric cancer was identified in 6% (17/302) of all these patients and in 28% (17/61) of patients undergoing curative resection. A review of presenting historical, physical, laboratory, radiologic, and endoscopic findings identified fiberoptic endoscopy as the most sensitive diagnostic procedure.

To detect formation of this cancer in patients having undergone this operation, we initiated a screening protocol using barium contrast studies, flexible gastroscopy, and biopsy. Patients were selected from a group of 233 patients who had undergone partial gastrectomy for benign disease between 1960 and 1975. In this group, operations for duodenal ulcer had been performed in 156 patients (83 Billroth I and 73 Billroth II reconstructions) and subtotal gastrectomy in 77 patients with gastric ulcer (17 Billroth I and 60 Billroth II reconstructions). From July 1980 to July 1985, 163 patients underwent gastroscopy and biopsy with a median postoperative interval of 14.6 years. Through screening, three resectable remnant carcinomas were found. We conclude that routine gastroscopy leads to earlier detection and a higher rate of resectability if gastric remnant carcinoma is found; yearly screening should be performed after a ten-year postresection interval; and gastroscopic biopsy is more accurate than upper gastrointestinal tract barium contrast studies and should be used preferentially to identify gastric remnant carcinoma.\r"

All ten of the patients in this series died despite a variety of therapeutic interventions. Risk factors may include the following: extreme arterial stenosis with resultant postoperative hyperperfusion, involvement of multiple extracranial cerebral vessels, postoperative systemic hypertension, and administration of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications. Unfortunately, identification of the subset of patients potentially at risk for this complication is difficult, and, to date, therapy has been generally ineffective.\r"

After five segmental mesenteric arterial ligations in each of six conditioned dogs, the detection threshold for the limits of arterial perfusion of each modality was determined and correlated with the respective histopathologic specimens. Infrared photoplethysmography proved to be 100% sensitive for ischemia when its waveform amplitudes were 50% or greater of matched reference waveforms, whereas both intravenous fluorescein and Doppler ultrasound were 88% sensitive. All were comparably specific. We conclude that infrared photoplethysmography is comparable to intravenous fluorescein and Doppler ultrasound in the assessment of ischemic intestinal segments.\r"

Histologic examination of early-recurring lesions (less than three years) revealed NFH in 17 patients and one complex lesion. Late-recurring lesions (three years or later) were due to atherosclerosis in eight vessels, NFH in four, and both RA and NFH in three. Focal neurologic symptoms occurred in 25 (76%) of 33 vessels, and an embolic source could be identified in 16 (64%) of 25 patients. Embolic events rather than reduced blood flow due to progressive stenosis are more frequent causes of symptoms in patients with recurrent carotid stenosis than was formerly believed.\r"

  ".W": "Infected median sternotomy represents a major complication of cardiac surgery, with significant morbidity and mortality. The treatment of choice is immediate drainage and closure over suction irrigation catheters. However, when this conservative approach fails or radical debridement makes primary closure impossible, muscle flap closure is indicated. This form of reconstruction facilitates the obliteration of large mediastinal wounds; prevents spreading of infection on the heart, suture lines, grafts, or prosthetic material; and significantly decreases morbidity and mortality. We performed muscle flap closure in 11 consecutive patients in whom conservative treatment of infected median sternotomy wounds failed. All patients required closure with at least two muscle flaps or omentum for the complete obliteration of the mediastinal wounds. There was one postoperative death in our series due to acute heart failure. There were two superficial skin losses requiring skin grafting and one persistent draining sinus after reconstruction. Based on our experience and that of others, we conclude that muscle flap reconstruction should be considered as an important technique for the reconstruction of infected median sternotomy wounds.\r"

  ".W": "Whether acute renal failure following overwhelming bacterial septicemia is a initially a consequence primarily of a cytotoxic insult or a perfusion insufficiency remains unclear. To assess the effects of intra-abdominal sepsis on the distribution of renal blood flow and renal cell bioenergy status, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and energy-charge ratios were measured in rats following cecal ligation/puncture (CLP) or sham laparotomies. The CLP animals demonstrated a decrease in ERPF of 42% and 58% from sham groups at ten and 20 hours, respectively. The GFR showed similar but more severe impairments of 53% and 71% at ten and 20 hours, respectively, following insult despite moderate increases in cardiac output. The disproportionate decrease in GFR over ERPF supports the hypothesis of a corticomedullary redistribution of renal blood flow in sepsis. Renal energy charge, unchanged at ten hours, decreased significantly at 20 hours. Diminished renal perfusion and the redistribution of renal blood flow precedes and may contribute to the renal cell bioenergy derangements in septic acute renal failure.\r"

One hundred mice underwent cholecystectomy or a sham operation. Equal groups received either ten weekly injections of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) or injections of saline. Twenty-four weeks after operation, the site, histologic findings, and number of tumors were noted. Crypt metaphase index (CMI) and proliferative zone size (PZS) determinations served as markers of preneoplasia. Tumors were found in the majority of animals receiving DMH while no tumors were found in the saline groups. Both CMI and PZS were significantly increased by DMH administration. Within the saline group, cholecystectomy increased CMI and PZS two and three times, respectively, over levels seen in the sham-operated animals. This suggests that cholecystectomy alone induces preneoplastic changes in the murine colonic crypt.\r"

The mortality was equal in both groups (21%). Severe morbidity directly related to the ileostomy was noted in six patients (18%), and three leaks (8%) were noted in the anastomotic group. High mortality continues to be associated with emergency right colon resection, regardless of the indication for the procedure.

Based on galactose elimination kinetics, this study validates galactose clearance at low concentrations as an estimate of effective hepatic blood flow in a rat peritonitis model of cecal ligation and puncture. Hepatic function as determined by galactose elimination capacity fell 25% at ten hours after induction of peritonitis, which correlated closely with the 20% reduction in effective hepatic blood flow at the same time point despite a normal cardiac output. The pattern of reduced flow and reduced function is consistent with intrahepatic flow redistribution. Inadequate flow at the microvascular level with secondary cellular injury may explain the liver dysfunction observed during sepsis.\r"

A major problem is the retention of sufficient intravascular persistence. The sites and mechanisms for clearance of SFH or its chemically modified variants are not well characterized. Capillary leakage has been reported. Any significant leak into the peritoneal cavity may be toxic, especially if bacteria are present. The present study quantitates peritoneal accumulation of SFH and chemically modified adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-SFH following a 50% exchange transfusion in rats. m-Dansyl cadaverine, an endocytotic blocking agent, was studied for its ability to alter accumulation of hemoglobin in the peritoneum. Differences in renal clearance corresponded to differences in vascular halflife of SFH (90 minutes) and ATP-SFH (210 minutes). Peritoneal leakage was not related to vascular persistence. We found that MDC significantly decreases the peritoneal accumulation of ATP-SFH but not that of SFH. We also noted that MDC neither inhibits nor alters renal clearance of either hemoglobin variant. Total peritoneal leakage is, at most, 4% of infused SFH at four hours. Molecular size and charge might be factors important in hemoglobin transport from the vasculature to the peritoneum.\r"

Using a continuous-wave Doppler velocimeter, the peak systolic frequency was determined distal to the stenosis and in planes parallel and perpendicular to the long axis of the stenosis. In both planes, an exponential regression best describes the relationship between peak systolic frequency and reduction in cross-sectional area. Regressions at each point of insonation diverged as a direct function of reduction in cross-sectional area and as an indirect function of distance from the stenosis. At each point of insonation, regressions representing the relationship in the mutually perpendicular planes diverged in direct proportion to reduction in cross-sectional area. Slopes were greater in parallel planes of insonation. These data demonstrate that two variables, distance and geometry, may influence the results of spectral analytic studies.\r"

Thirteen dogs underwent bilateral common carotid endarterectomies (intimectomy and partial media excision). In each dog, one artery was closed by continuous suture and the contralateral artery was closed by external jugular vein-patch angioplasty; arteries were excised at two postoperative intervals (two to three and four to five weeks) for light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. The patency of arteries closed primarily (9/13 [69%]) was not significantly different compared with arteries closed with venous patches (12/13 [92%]). By scanning electron microscopy, regeneration of the endothelial monolayer occurred by migration from the endarterectomy end points and suture lines. Despite survival of the vein-patch endothelium, the rate and pattern of reendothelialization was not altered by venous patching. In both patched and unpatched vessels, endothelial regeneration was incomplete at two to three weeks and completed by four to five weeks. The histologic characteristics of the endarterectomized arterial wall after operation were also not influenced by the closure technique. In contrast with the healing artery wall, vein-patch walls did not develop a thickened intima. Although venous patching does not influence early patency, endothelial regeneration, or wall healing after endarterectomy, vein-patch angioplasty does increase vessel diameter and prevents the development of circumferential intimal thickening, attributes that are beneficial in minimizing restenosis.\r"

Twenty asymptomatic popliteal aneurysms were repaired without loss of limb and with a five-year secondary cumulative patency rate of 93%. Among 26 small asymptomatic popliteal aneurysms managed without operation, complications developed in only two (8%) during the period of observation. Because of the demonstrated safety and efficacy of surgical treatment, repair of popliteal aneurysms is recommended in acceptable operative candidates. However, there exists a subgroup of asymptomatic higher-risk patients with small popliteal aneurysms in whom a conservative nonoperative approach is reasonably safe.\r"

The most common operative procedure was oversewing of the perforation with an omental patch (ten cases). Postoperative complications occurred in 16 patients and were multiple in 11. Underlying malignant neoplasms were the most common concurrent disease (11 patients), five patients having brain metastasis. Of 25 patients, 15 died--five preoperatively and ten postoperatively. Patients older than age 50 years had an overall mortality of 85%; those younger than age 50 years, 17%. A recurring pattern in 21 patients was perforation occurring after a major increase in steroid dose (pulse). Ulcer perforations associated with steroid use constitute a significant portion of all ulcer perforations, are lethal in most patients older than age 50 years, and are often associated with a steroid pulse before perforation.\r"

A decrease in velocity and stride, an increase in sway, and the proportion of time spent in double-limb stance were nonspecific features correlated with declining performance. Certain features appeared to characterize hydrocephalic gait when compared among groups; cadence was diminished, and there was a reduction of step height and a decreased counterrotation of the shoulders relative to the pelvis. An abnormal tendency toward cocontraction in antagonist muscle groups was observed in electromyographic data from the leg muscles, suggesting that the normal phased activation of muscle groups is disturbed. Although data are not conclusive, we believe that the gait disorder in normal-pressure hydrocephalus reflects a subcortical motor control disorder rather than a phenomenon of spasticity or apraxia.\r"

No other clinical variable (sex, preceding illness, severity, timing of plasmapheresis, cranial nerve involvement, or cerebrospinal fluid findings) reached significance. Among electrophysiologic parameters obtained before plasmapheresis, the amplitudes of compound muscle action potentials with distal stimulation of median and peroneal nerves were significantly reduced in non-responders. Plasmapheresis may improve only a subgroup of patients with GBS. Among patient characteristics, age and amplitudes of compound muscle action potentials are important predictors of early responsiveness.\r"

Multiple high-signal MRI lesions involving the cerebral cortex are characteristic of tuberous sclerosis and probably correspond to the hamartomas and gliotic areas seen pathologically. These cortical lesions were only occasionally seen with CCT. The periventricular calcific lesions characteristic of tuberous sclerosis are better visualized with CCT than with MRI, but the larger periventricular calcifications produce low-signal MRI abnormalities. Seven patients had high-signal MRI lesions of the cerebellum; small calcific cerebellar lesions were also noted with CCT in three patients. As in earlier studies, no clear correlation was seen between the number of abnormalities visible with CCT and the clinical severity of the disease. By contrast, the more severely affected patients tend to have a higher number of cerebral cortical lesions detected with MRI. Thus, MRI may be useful in predicting the eventual clinical severity of younger children with newly diagnosed tuberous sclerosis.\r"

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated that the patients had two discrete left hemisphere lesions, one in the anterior language cortices or language-related subcortical areas, and one in the posterior language cortices. Cerebral angiography showed that two patients had complete occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, and the third had an intraluminal \"clot\" in the supraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid, findings suggestive of an embolic etiology. Our cases indicate that global aphasia without hemiparesis predicts two discrete lesions and a particularly good recovery of speech and language.\r"

When patients with a prior diagnosis of epilepsy were excluded, epileptiform abnormalities were discovered in 2.6% of patients. Patients younger than age 25 years and patients with a diagnostic impression of anorexia nervosa, recent barbiturate abuse, or nonpsychotic explosive behavior were significantly more likely to have epileptiform abnormalities. The use of certain therapeutic agents was associated with a significant excess of epileptiform abnormalities in patients aged 25 years and older. The most frequently encountered epileptiform abnormalities were photoconvulsive responses. Focal temporal epileptiform abnormalities were detected in only four patients without a prior diagnosis of epilepsy. The diagnosis of epilepsy on the basis of a primarily psychiatric presentation and the discovery of epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalographic screening should be approached with caution.\r"

Examination of the cerebellum was not mentioned. The most recent postmortem neuropathologic study reported significant cerebellar abnormality, but the study was of a severely retarded autistic individual. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we have found in vivo evidence of a significant and unusual cerebellar malformation in a person with the classic form of autism uncomplicated by mental retardation (current nonverbal IQ = 112), epilepsy, history of drug use, postnatal trauma, or disease. The finding showed hypoplasia of the declive, folium, and tuber in posterior vermis, but not of the anterior vermis, and hypoplasia of only the medial aspect of each cerebellar hemisphere. The right posterior cerebral hemisphere also showed pathologic findings.\r"

Chorea and dementia were rare. Twenty-two patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging. All but one of the 19 symptomatic patients had abnormal scans. The three asymptomatic patients had normal scans. Most lesions were seen in the caudate, putamen, subcortical white matter, midbrain, and pons. Generalized brain atrophy was also common. Lesions were less common in the thalamus, cerebellar vermis, midbrain tegmentum, globus pallidus, red nucleus, and dentate nucleus. Dystonia and bradykinesia correlated with putamen lesions, and dysarthria correlated with both putamen and caudate lesions.\r"

The contralateral responses generally mirrored the ipsilateral responses, but in seven patients the responses differed, mainly involving the presence or absence of wave V. However, contralateral recordings did not contribute significantly to the sensitivity of lesion detection, and their main value was to aid in the recognition of waves when they were not clearly seen in the ipsilateral recordings. The BAER abnormality rates were found to be significantly correlated with disability, and it is suggested that this is an important variable to consider when undertaking or comparing results of BAER studies in patients with multiple sclerosis.\r"

The patients with Alzheimer's disease were significantly impaired on TOL compared with demented patients with Parkinson's disease, even though both groups were equated for severity of dementia. On TRL, the patients with Alzheimer's disease and demented patients with Parkinson's disease were both significantly impaired, but the patients with Alzheimer's disease showed significantly more perseverative errors. The mechanisms underlying TOL and TRL deficits may serve to differentiate Alzheimer's from Parkinson's dementia, and may involve selective parietal system lesions.\r"

Results demonstrated significantly higher levels of serum cholesterol and triglyceride among the TIA patients compared with randomly selected age-matched normal controls of similar educational and environmental backgrounds. Cerebral blood flow levels were reduced among groups of TIA patients with elevated levels of either cholesterol or triglycerides compared with the TIA patients with normal lipid levels. Similar trends were seen among normal volunteers, but these did not reach levels of statistical significance because of the limited numbers available. Analysis of frequency distributions for risk factors other than hyperlipidemia indicated that hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking were also more prevalent among TIA patients than among age-matched normal controls.\r"

Plasma levels of free catecholamines were significantly elevated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, no significant differences in plasma catecholamines were found when the patients with SAH were subdivided into noncomatose and comatose groups. In contrast, plasma HVA, MHPG, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels in comatose patients with SAH significantly increased as compared not only with normal controls but also with noncomatose patients with SAH, and the peak levels of HVA and MHPG occurred within seven days poststroke. Such trends as observed in SAH were not observed in patients with cerebral hemorrhage.

Acute neurologic injuries should be distinguished from chronic brain injuries and the level of competitive boxing (ie, amateur vs professional) must also be taken into account. Acute neurologic injuries such as concussion, post-concussion syndrome, intracranial hemorrhage, and brain contusion are more readily identified than chronic neurologic injuries because of their immediate devastation of the nervous system. In contrast, chronic neurologic injuries differ in their pathophysiologic mechanisms that are exemplified by an insidious onset and progression after the cessation of boxing. Accordingly, the chronic traumatic encephalopathy of boxing poses the most serious neurologic threat of boxing. Amateur boxing differs from professional boxing in the duration of fights, rules and regulatory policies, medical evaluation, and protective devices. These factors could produce a differential effect on the risk of injury to the brain. The prevention of neurologic injuries in boxing requires the integration of proper neurologic evaluation by qualified ring-side physicians, the design and utilization of effective protective devices, and the establishment of national regulatory agencies.\r"

The visual loss may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Total irreversible unilateral visual loss developed in three patients with this syndrome. Severe visual loss was preceded by diplopia in one patient and by bilateral eyelid edema in another. One patient with chronic panparanasal sinusitis with acute visual loss presented with isolated optic disc edema. Proptosis and ductional restriction subsequently developed. The irreversible blindness in these cases may be due to a combination of intracanalicular edema and vasculitis causing optic nerve infarction.\r"

Eight patients subsequently required enucleation due to inadequate tumor response. Of the 15 patients who demonstrated successful tumor destruction and retained their eyes, 13 (86.7%) developed substantial irradiation-induced retinopathy, including hard exudates, telangiectasias, neovascularization, microaneurysms, intraretinal and vitreous hemorrhages, secondary glaucoma, and irradiation-induced cataract. Our long-term results indicate a high incidence of both vascular complications and decreased visual acuity.\r"

We studied three groups of children: normal appearing, clinically retinol deficient (defined by the presence of superficial fine punctate keratitis), and clinically retinol deficient with measles. The last group was subdivided into those with low serum retinol levels (less than or equal to 20 micrograms/dL [less than or equal to mumol/L]) and those with normal serum retinol levels (greater than 20 micrograms/dL [greater than 0.70 mumol/L]). In the control group of seven normal-appearing children with a mean age of 4.6 years, the mean MR was 1.3% +/- 0.4%, and the mean GCF was 8.0% +/- 3.6% of the basal epithelial cells. In seven children with clinical retinol deficiency, the mean MR was 15.4% +/- 1.2%, and the mean GCF was 1.0% +/- 0.5%, values significantly different from normal ones. Among 11 children with clinical retinol deficiency, measles, and low serum retinol levels, the mean MR was 9.0% +/- 1.9%, and the mean GCF was 3.1% +/- 1.1%, values not statistically different from those in children with clinical retinol deficiency alone. Five children with clinical retinol deficiency, measles, and normal serum retinol levels had a mean MR of 10.2% +/- 3.7% and a mean GCF of 1.9% +/- 1.7%, values similar to those in the other disease groups. This indicates that retinol deficiency sufficient to cause clinical signs without subepithelial scarring or keratinization is associated with hyperproliferation of the conjunctiva whether or not there is a superimposed measles infection.\r"

A decision to intervene was based on progressive visual loss unresponsive to other modes of therapy and accompanied by retrobulbar optic nerve sheath enlargement as determined by computed tomography, contrast orbitography, or orbital echography. Follow-up ranged from three months to nine years, with an average of 17 months. Visual function improvement was noted within one month after operation in seven of 19 eyes. The other 12 eyes showed no improvement or continued to worsen. Postoperative complications were infrequent, with motility disturbances being the most common. Optic nerve sheath decompression via the medial orbital approach has a low operative morbidity and may improve visual function in patients with progressive visual loss associated with the accumulation of compressible fluids in the retro-orbital optic nerve sheaths. This relatively safe surgical approach to the retrobulbar optic nerve may also be of future use in the retrieval of optic nerve tissue and fluid for chemical and cytologic analysis.\r"

A computed tomogram demonstrated a well-circumscribed, low-density, homogeneous orbital mass. Initially, the main clinical differential diagnosis included dermoid cyst, hemangioma, and encephalocele. Medial orbitotomy followed by histopathologic examination disclosed a cystic choristomatous malformation containing brain tissue. No choroid plexuses within the mass were demonstrated on microscopic examination. Aspiration of fluid from the cystic mass and subsequent biochemical studies unequivocally demonstrated that the mass was filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Despite five surgical procedures, including two frontal craniotomies, and specialized roentgenographic studies, no communication could be demonstrated between the orbital mass and the central nervous system. We postulate that the cerebrospinal fluid was produced within the orbital mass, which represented ectopic brain tissue. Problems in diagnosis and management of this unusual orbital malformation are discussed.\r"

Fluorouridine, an intracellular metabolite of fluorouracil, is nearly 100-fold more potent than fluorouracil and its deoxymetabolite. Human dermal fibroblasts are more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of deoxymetabolites than the cells of either human retinal pigment epithelium or bovine aortic vascular endothelium.

The in vitro half-life of cytarabine release from these liposomes was 359 hours. Following subconjunctival administration of 6 mg of cytarabine to 12 rabbits, the tissue half-life of drug at the injection site was 52.5 hours in the six rabbits treated with liposomes compared with 0.2 hours in the six nonliposome controls treated with the same amount of drug in normal saline solution. The aqueous humor drug concentration peaked after 1.5 hours in both the experimental (0.4 mg/L) and control (19 mg/L) groups. In control eyes, the cytarabine level of both the tissue and aqueous humor had decreased to less than 1% of peak value by eight hours. In the liposome-treated eyes, almost 30% of the cytarabine remained in the conjunctiva and episcleral tissue after 72 hours. The difference in cytarabine levels in tissue between the liposome-treated group and controls was highly significant. By controlling the rate of drug release, it may be possible to reduce the ocular toxicity and increase the efficacy of this drug for treating ocular proliferative disorders.\r"

Histopathologic examination of lids from rabbits with blepharitis showed a dense leukocytic infiltrate and dilated blood vessels beneath an intact epidermis and palpebral conjunctival epithelium. The infiltrate contained neutrophils as well as mononuclear cells, including macrophages, plasma cells, and lymphocytes. The meibomian glands appeared normal. Gram's staining of lid sections did not show gram-positive cocci. The results of this study suggest that hypersensitivity to the S aureus cell wall, and particularly the ribitol teichoic acid that it contains, plays a role in the pathogenesis of staphylococcal blepharitis.\r"
