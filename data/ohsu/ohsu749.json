  ".W": "The efficacy and the side effects of a continuous infusion of lidocaine in the fifth intercostal space for the management of postoperative pain after lateral thoracotomy were evaluated in 20 adults. An indwelling catheter was inserted in the appropriate intercostal space before thoracotomy closure. After recovery from general anesthesia, a loading dose of 3 mg/kg of 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:160,000 was injected through the catheter, followed by a continuous infusion of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine at a rate of 1 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 54 h. In seven patients pharmacokinetic data were obtained. Pain, assessed by visual continuous analog scale, decreased from a median score of 8 (range, 7-10) to a score of 5 (range, 2-7) 20 min after the loading dose of lidocaine and continued to decrease until the end of the study (P = 0.0001). Complete cutaneous analgesia, assessed by pinprick test, was seen in a median of three thoracic spinal segments (range, 0-6) with partial cutaneous analgesia in seven segments (range, 6-9) 40 min after the loading dose, and levels that remained unchanged for 54 h (P = 0.0001). Peak lidocaine serum concentrations, 1.9 +/- 0.7 micrograms/mL, were present 9 +/- 3 min after injection of the loading dose. Serum concentrations of lidocaine under steady state conditions averaged 4.8 +/- 0.9 micrograms/mL (range, 3.5-5.8 micrograms/mL). This level under steady state conditions, though below the toxic level, suggests that additional bolus injection of lidocaine during the course of infusion might result in potentially toxic serum levels of lidocaine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Using two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography, mitral valve function was assessed during mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In 10 anesthetized pigs CPR began 1 min after induction of ventricular fibrillation; in all pigs three different compressive forces (200, 350, and 500 Newton [N]) were applied in randomized sequence for 3 min each, thus resulting in a reduction of anterior-posterior chest diameter by 15%, 20%, and 25%, respectively. Echocardiographic recordings of adequate technical quality were obtained from seven animals. During ventricular fibrillation, mitral valve leaflets showed fibrillatory movements without closure. During CPR systole with a compressive force of 200 N, the mitral valve closed in 114 of 700 CPR cycles (16%). This rate increased significantly (P less than 0.001) to 399 of 584 cycles (68%) with 350 N, and further to 470 of 494 cycles (95%) with 500 N. The higher mitral valve closure incidence was linked to statistically significant increases in systolic cerebral (+125%) and diastolic myocardial perfusion pressures (+136%) and cardiac output. We thus conclude that with low compressive force blood flow during mechanical CPR is due mainly to the chest pump mechanism, whereas the cardiac pump mechanism is effective with high compressive forces.\r"

Epidural anesthesia was performed with 15-18 mL of 1.5% plain lidocaine using a catheter inserted at the L3-4 level. The upper level of analgesia to pinprick was measured 20 min after lidocaine injection. Ventilatory measurements and arterial blood gas analyses were performed (a) preoperatively, in the horizontal supine position with a T7-9 level of analgesia; (b) in the 20 degrees Trendelenburg position with a T2-5 level of analgesia; (c) during intraabdominal insufflation of CO2 through the laparoscope; and (d) after CO2 exsufflation by manual compression of the abdomen before removal of the laparoscope while in the horizontal position. On-line measurements of VO2, VCO2, VE, VT, F, and PETCO2 were made using a Beckman metabolic cart, while the patients breathed room air through an anesthetic face mask. No significant changes in the ventilatory variables were observed in the Trendelenburg position. In contrast, CO2 insufflation significantly increased VE (from 9.1 +/- 1.0 L/min to 11.8 +/- 2.6 L/min, mean +/- SD), and F (from 16.9 +/- 1.9 breaths/min to 23.1 +/- 3.3 breaths/min, mean +/- SD), whereas VCO2 remained unchanged. PaCO2 remained constant throughout the study. These results suggest that epidural anesthesia may be a safe alternative to general anesthesia for outpatient laparoscopy, as it is not associated with ventilatory depression.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effects of halothane and enflurane on diaphragmatic contractility in 12 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs. The diaphragmatic force was assessed from transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) developed at functional residual capacity against an occluded airway during cervical phrenic nerve stimulation. Animals were randomly assigned to two groups, a halothane group (n = 6) and an enflurane group (n = 6). The Pdi stimulus-frequency relationship was compared at anesthetic levels of 1, 1.5, and 2 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) in each group. The sequence of changing anesthetic concentration was randomized. In addition, the Pdi-frequency relationship was also compared between 1 MAC of halothane and enflurane in 8 of 12 dogs. In animals anesthetized with enflurane, Pdi significantly decreased with 50- and 100-Hz stimulation in the presence of increasing MAC values, whereas Pdi at 10-Hz stimulation was not affected by the depth of anesthesia. Pdi with 20-Hz stimulation during 2 MAC enflurane also decreased significantly below Pdi levels seen at 1 and 1.5 MAC. By contrast, with halothane there was no difference in Pdi at any of the stimulation frequencies during any of the three levels of anesthesia. There was no statistical difference, however, between Pdi-frequency relationships during 1 MAC of halothane and enflurane in eight animals. From these results, we conclude that halothane does not impair diaphragmatic contractility any more than enflurane does, but enflurane decreases force generation of the diaphragm at high stimulation frequencies in a dose-related fashion. This depressant effect of enflurane occurs mainly through the impairment of neuromuscular transmission and/or membrane excitability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The first admixture induced three successive stages of electroencephalogram (EEG): delta-waves lasting for 13 +/- 12 min, theta-waves lasting for 41 +/- 21 min, and, finally, spindle-type waves. The spindle-type EEG was similar to that of halothane anesthesia in configuration, but smaller in amplitude and faster in frequency than that seen during halothane anesthesia. The second admixture, given after a 20-30-min interval, induced a continuous delta-wave EEG in one patient, theta-waves followed by spindle EEG in eight patients, and spindle-type EEG in four patients. The successive changes of electroencephalographic response during the first admixture indicate that an alteration of central nervous system function occurred. The altered state was maintained in the absence of nitrous oxide: responses to a second admixture were characteristic of the later, altered, stages of responses seen after the first admixture. These findings support the view of acute tolerance to nitrous oxide.\r"

Cardiac tamponade was produced by infusing normal saline into the intrapericardial space to increase IPP to either 8 mm Hg (group 1, n = 8) or 12 mm Hg (group 2, n = 8). Stroke index in group 1 was 7.3 +/- 0.8 during CMV (f = 10), 8.1 +/- 0.7 during CMV (f = 20), 10.9 +/- 1.4 during HFJV (f = 60), and 10.7 +/- 1.2 (mL.beat-1.m-2) during HFJV (f = 120). Stroke index in group 2 was 4.1 +/- 0.7, 5.1 +/- 0.5, 7.2 +/- 0.5, and 6.7 +/- 0.5 (mL.beat-1.m-2), respectively. In both IPP groups, stroke index values during HFJV were significantly higher than during CMV; however, there were no significant differences in mean left and right atrial transmural pressures between HFJV and CMV. Peak IPP, mean P(aw), and peak P(aw) during HFJV were significantly lower than those during CMV. The results indicate that HFJV with lower mean and peak Paw, and with lower mean and peak IPP, can result in higher cardiac output than CMV in cardiac tamponade. Thus, HFJV may be superior to CMV in the clinical management of cardiac tamponade.\r"

We determined the cardiovascular and neuromuscular effects of three new and promising nondepolarizing muscle relaxants in six dogs anesthetized with halothane. Each dog was anesthetized four times (each time separated from the others by at least 1 wk); one muscle relaxant was studied each time. Three doses (one, three, and five times the ED90) were given as intravenous bolus injections. ORG 9616 and ORG 9991 had shorter durations of action than ORG 9426. The duration of action of the doses that were five times the ED90 was 18 +/- 5.88 and 15.8 +/- 4.41 min (mean +/- SD) with ORG 9616 and ORG 9991, respectively, as compared with 39.7 +/- 17.15 min with ORG 9426 (P less than 0.05). ORG 9426 was virtually free of cardiovascular effects. The ED90 doses of ORG 9616 and ORG 9991 did not cause cardiovascular effects; the doses of three and five times the ED90 caused small decreases in mean arterial blood pressure and increases in heart rate. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 99 +/- 10.2 to 88 +/- 13.1 mm Hg and from 98 +/- 11.7 to 77 +/- 8.1 mm Hg with five times the ED90 dose of ORG 9616 and ORG 9991, respectively. The authors conclude that ORG 9426 has a duration of neuromuscular blockade that is probably similar to vecuronium, and one that is free of cardiovascular effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Multivariate analysis showed that age (P less than 0.0001), direction of the bevel of the needle when puncturing the dura mater (P = 0.022), and a history of previous PDPH (P = 0.018) were significant predictors of PDPH. The estimated relation between PDPH, on the one hand, and age and orientation of the bevel, on the other, enables the anesthetist to predict the risk of PDPH and thereby to choose an acceptable age limit for spinal anesthesia.\r"

Six anesthetized dogs were studied every 2 wk, on 18 separate occasions. Hyperkalemia was induced by intravenous infusion of potassium chloride, resulting in plasma potassium concentrations of 9.6 +/- 0.3 mEq/L (mean +/- SEM), bradycardia, and idioventricular rhythm. Dogs were then given slow intravenous injections every 30 min of either saline (controls), epinephrine, or ritodrine. Epinephrine doses were 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, or 100 micrograms/kg; ritodrine doses were 0.1, 1.0, 10, 100, or 1000 micrograms/kg. At the highest does, both epinephrine and ritodrine caused clinically important decreases in plasma potassium, reducing concentrations to below 7.0 mEq/L. Ritodrine had a significantly greater effect than epinephrine. Side effects included hypertension and dysrhythmias with epinephrine, serious hypotension with ritodrine, and tachycardia with both drugs. For both drugs, the doses that caused a decrease in plasma potassium also caused an increase in heart rate and there was a correlation between plasma potassium levels and heart rate. Epinephrine and ritodrine may be useful in treating acute hyperkalemia, but cardiovascular side effects may occur. Increased heart rate could be used as an indicator of therapeutic effect and the magnitude of the increase in heart rate may be helpful in predicting the level of response.\r"

The drug was administered intravenously 15 min before anesthesia induction with thiopental. Nitrous oxide/oxygen (70%/30%) was used for maintenance. Dexmedetomidine was well tolerated, and no serious drug-related subjective side effects or adverse events were observed. The most prominent subjective effects were tiredness and decreased salivation. The total amount of thiopental needed to perform uterine dilatation and curettage was decreased dose-dependently from 400 +/- 166 mg (mean +/- SD) after 0.167 microgram/kg of dexmedetomidine to 180 +/- 65 mg after 1.0 micrograms/kg of dexmedetomidine (P = 0.028).

An infusion of lidocaine (3 mg/min, n = 15) or an infusion of an equal volume of saline (n = 15) was started 30 min before induction of anesthesia and continued for 24 h after surgery. Postoperative colonic motility was evaluated by radiopaque markers and serial abdominal radiographs. A record was kept of the first passage of gas and feces. Results showed significantly earlier return of propulsive motility in the colon of lidocaine-treated patients. Radiopaque markers in the lidocaine group were propelled significantly earlier from the cecum/ascending colon to the transverse colon (P less than 0.05) and appeared significantly earlier in the descending colon (P less than 0.05) and the rectosigmoid colon (P less than 0.05) than in saline-treated patients. Despite the fact that the mean time for postoperative defecation occurred 17 h earlier in lidocaine-treated patients, differences between the groups were not statistically significant--a fact due, perhaps, to great individual variations in defecation habits. The time to first passage of gas, a variable representative of changes in anorectal or colonic tone rather than propagative motility, also did not differ significantly between the groups. No adverse reactions to lidocaine were reported. The results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of lidocaine during the first postoperative day shortens the duration of paralytic ileus in the colon after abdominal surgery. Suppression of inhibitory gastrointestinal reflexes by reduction of postoperative peritoneal irritation is suggested as the mechanism of action.\r"

  ".W": "Survival rates from colorectal cancer will rise only when polyps and cancers are found at an earlier, curable stage. Consequently, the purpose of the present study was to compare the yield of colonic neoplasms from flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy with that from occult blood testing. Results from 474 flexible sigmoidoscopies and 1,115 colonoscopies were prospectively recorded during a four-year study period. Colorectal polyps were found in 111 (23.4%) patients undergoing flexible sigmoidoscopy and 325 (29.1%) patients undergoing colonoscopy. Among the 436 patients with polyps, the occult blood test was negative in 282 (64.7%). Among the 51 patients with colorectal cancers, the occult blood test was negative in 20 (39.1%). Thus, testing for occult blood missed the majority of polyps and a large percentage of the carcinomas. These data indicate that lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is superior to occult blood testing as a screening test for detecting colorectal polyps or cancers. Furthermore, given the high incidence of neoplasia in this patient population, the authors suggest that colonoscopy become the screening test of choice for colorectal cancer.\r"

In patients with known colon cancer, the incidence of synchronous colon cancers is 1.5 to 7.6 per cent and synchronous colon polyps is 25 to 40 per cent. Standard barium contrast studies are inferior to endoscopic examination in detecting these synchronous lesions. Endoscopy has been shown to alter the planned surgical procedure in 11 to 13 per cent of patients with colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, some authors avoid preoperative endoscopy because of concern that neoplastic cells may be seeded throughout the colon during the examination. They fear that manipulation of the tumor may promote hematogenous or lymphatic spread. Our study seeks to demonstrate whether this concern is valid by comparing rates of local recurrence, distant metastases, and survival between patients who have undergone preoperative endoscopy with those who have not.\r"

Using its color capabilities, one may initiate a picture database of patient's endoscopic images, x rays, and relevant clinical data. The computer-based imaging system allows instant access to this information and minimizes subjective evaluation, improving comparison and follow-up of treatments in a more objective manner. The image analysis components permit digital characterization of lesions, which allows online measurements and image enhancement.

Prior work from the authors' laboratory has demonstrated that direct muscle stimulation can be safely performed for prolonged periods. Thus, in 1983, a laparoscopic technique was devised for the direct implantation of diaphragm pacing electrodes in the canine. During the subsequent four years, 16 animals (10 acute and 6 chronic) have undergone diaphragm pacing. Under general anesthesia, diaphragm pacing electrodes loaded into 19-gauge needles were implanted under direct laparoscopic visualization in both hemidiaphragms. In each animal, tidal volume, transdiaphragmatic pressure, arterial blood gas, impedence, cardiac activation, and histology of electrode placement site have been evaluated. Chronically paced animals were subjected to daily 8- to 24-hr per day pacing. The longest paced animal has been 179 days with continuous 24-hour per day pacing. In both acute and chronic experiments, maximal evoked tidal volume has approached 400 per cent of resting tidal volume. Cardiac ectopy has not occurred. This work has demonstrated the safety and feasibility of direct muscular diaphragm activation using the laparoscope. It has provided the basis for embarking upon a clinical study of this modality as a method of chronic ventilatory support. The laparoscopic technique of electrode placement may have a variety of other potential applications.\r"

Radiologic studies show that traction shortened the tract (4.9 +/- 1.1 cm with traction, 11.6 +/- 2.3 cm without traction). In two patients with fasciitis, gross pericatheter leak of contrast into a short and patulous tract was observed. Tube extrusion and gastrointestinal bleeding from gastric ersion ulcers were eliminated when traction was not used. No peritonitis occurred as a result of not attempting to approximate the stomach to the abdominal wall. The data suggest that traction on the gastrostomy tube is not only unnecessary, but is the cause of many of the complications reported.\r"

Indeed, numerous retrospective studies have shown that percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is superior to its surgical counterpart. There are, however, both absolute and relative contraindications to percutaneous placement. Reported here are three patients who were poor surgical candidates, yet had contraindications to percutaneous placement. Described is a method of combined endoscopic and surgical placement under local anesthesia used successfully in these patients. General anesthesia and laparotomy were not required. A 2-cm incision with endoscopic guidance was used and the gastrostomy was placed under direct vision and secured with a gastric purse string and sutured to the abdominal wall. There was no morbidity or mortality among the three cases reported. All gastrostomies were considered functional within 48 hrs. The authors feel this method is an excellent alternative when PEG is contraindicated. In addition, it may represent the safest and most effective method of gastrostomy placement in the majority of patients requiring a gastrostomy.\r"

We reviewed the records of 100 patients for details of the endoscopic procedure and demographic data. Performance status and survival were critically assessed. We performed 275 procedures on 57 men and 43 women with an average age of 76.5 years. An average of 2.75 procedures, each lasting an average of 45 minutes, were performed per patient. Half of the patients had fulgurations of rectal tumors with the common indication being bleeding. Thirteen morbid events and no deaths occurred. Ninety-six per cent of the procedures were performed with the patient under intravenous sedation. The Karnofsky performance scale applied to surviving patients revealed that 90 per cent were able to care for themselves and scored greater than 70. Average survival was 5.58 months. Our results indicate that the Nd-YAG is a safe and effective tool in the treatment of colorectal neoplasms offering palliation as well as maintenance of quality of life.\r"

Between June 1985 and December 1988, 26 patients have been treated for advanced upper GI malignancy: 20 obstructing esophageal carcinomas (three proximal, eight middle, and nine distal third); two prepyloric obstructing and one bleeding gastric lesion; one bleeding pancreatic carcinoma eroding into the duodenum; and two primary duodenal lesions (one partially obstructing and one bleeding). The dysphagia grade improved in all patients with esophageal carcinoma, but less so for those with proximal tumors. The obstructing gastric lesions were recanalized and bleeding was arrested. The pancreatic and duodenal lesions were successfully managed with one treatment. There were no perforations or other laser-related complications. The approaches to palliation must be conceived in a fashion to improve the quality of life with minimal risk and discomfort. Although ultimate survival is determined by the stage of the disease, the Nd:YAG laser can restore gastrointestinal continuity and, in so doing, significantly palliate the patient.\r"

All animals had stable weight and eating habits at sacrifice. Light microscopy of the cardia and LES included morphometry of wall thickness (mm) and assessment of fibrosis (- to ). The esophagus had minimal changes; the gastric cardia had focal fibrosis, maximal on the greater curve, without any change difference in wall thickness. ESGC results in fibrosis of the gastric cardia, without significant changes in the esophagus. These changes prevent GER, possibly by preventing the initiation of a reflux event.\r"

In a large obesity practice, 40 patients presented with this complication. The authors reviewed retrospectively the management of these strictures, using endoscopic dilatation. All patients were morbidly obese, defined as greater than 100 pounds more than ideal weight. The original gastric-restrictive procedure included vertical-banded gastroplasty (35 patients); revision vertical-banded gastroplasty (2 patients); and revision of gastric bypass to vertical-banded gastroplasty (3 patients). Three methods were used: dilatation with endoscope, balloon dilatation, and Savary-Guilliard dilatation. Twenty-seven patients became asymptomatic after dilatation (68%). Occasionally, multiple dilatations were necessary. In 13 patients (32%), dilatation was unsuccessful and revision surgery was needed. In early postoperative (6 to 12 weeks) stricture, dilatation with the endoscope was often successful. When strictures were associated with an angulated channel, dilatation was almost uniformly unsuccessful. In summary, endoscopic dilatation for postgastroplasty strictures is a useful and effective technique, obviating the need for operative revision in the majority of patients; however, when the stenosis is associated with channel angulation, dilatation is almost uniformly unsuccessful. Such patients should not be subjected to repeated dilatation but rather proceed promptly to revision surgery.\r"

This study examines the incidence and histologic correlates of multiple and single duodenal nodules in 2,966 consecutive male patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy during the past five years. Five per cent had duodenal nodules. When two or more discrete nodules, with or without apical ulceration, were present, the finding was termed nodular duodenitis, which was seen five and one-half times more frequently than single nodules. There were 127 patients with nodular duodenitis (4.3%); seven had chronic renal disease and 33 (26%) had concomitant peptic ulcer disease. Biopsies showed either normal mucosa or histologic aberrations typical of nonspecific duodenitis. Single nodules were seen in only 23 patients (0.8%). Biopsies of these nodules revealed benign or malignant tumors in five instances and infrequently showed only normal mucosa. It is concluded that nodular duodenitis is a visually distinct, morphologic variant of nonspecific duodenitis bearing some yet-to-be-defined relationship to peptic ulcer disease. Single nodules are much less likely to represent duodenitis and, in fact, they have significant neoplastic potential, mandating biopsy whenever they are found.\r"

Recently, flexible choledochoscopy has become available to evaluate the interior of the common duct. We compared four cases, using the videocholedochoscope with completion T-tube cholangiography, both in our four patients and historically. We used the Olympus CHF-P20 flexible choledochoscope, which is 4.8 mm in diameter, hooked to an Olympus S-4 videoadapter. We found that flexible choledochoscopy enabled us to evaluate the biliary tree directly from the ampulla to the third branch radicle within the liver. In all cases, the common ducts were normal after stone removal. Both the preexploration and completion T-tube cholangiograms yielded less information. We conclude that flexible choledochoscopy is an improved technique that allows a more thorough evaluation of the common duct, obviates more extensive procedures, i.e., sphincteroplasty, by removing stones through the scope, and negates the need for a completion T-tube cholangiogram. We encourage all biliary tract surgeons to consider this technique for their own use.\r"

Sphincterotomy was performed in 42 per cent of the procedures and common bile duct stones were removed with a balloon or basket catheter. The overall complication rate was seven per cent with no mortality. ERCP accounted for 20 per cent of all endoscopies and 12 per cent of all procedures performed by the surgeon. Twelve per cent of these patients were subsequently operated upon by the surgeon while another 16 per cent requiring surgery were returned to the referring physician. This study supports the feasibility of the incorporation of ERCP into a general surgery practice.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To review the effects of antihypercalcemic treatment on morbidity and mortality in cancer-associated hypercalcemia. DESIGN: Retrospective study of 126 consecutive patients with cancer-associated hypercalcemia. SETTING: Inpatient referrals from a teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. INTERVENTION: Medical antihypercalcemic therapy supplemented by specific anticancer therapy where possible. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Median survival was 30 days. Survival did not differ in patients treated with different antihypercalcemic regimens but was longer (median, 135 days; P less than 0.001) in a subgroup of 26 patients for whom specific anticancer therapy was available. Polyuria and polydipsia improved after therapy in 83% of cases, central nervous system symptoms in 71%, constipation in 70%, nausea and vomiting in 56%, anorexia in 50%, and malaise and fatigue in 47% (all significant, P less than 0.001, pre-treatment compared with post-treatment). Pain control improved in only 23% of cases (not significant). Only 7% of patients with post-treatment serum calcium values above 3.50 mmol/L improved clinically compared with 80% whose calcium values fell below 2.80 mmol/L (P less than 0.001). Corresponding figures for the proportion of patients discharged from the hospital were 0% and 68% (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy is poor in cancer-associated hypercalcemia even in patients who are actively treated. Antihypercalcemic therapy has an important palliative role, however, because symptoms are usually improved and, in many cases, patients may be made well enough to be discharged from the hospital during the terminal stages of their illness.\r"

Such histologic changes are similar to those seen in graft-versus-host disease. The EB virus genome was mainly detected in the basal, germinative cells of the abnormal epithelium. Specimens of our patient's healthy skin were negative. The presence of EB virus DNA in skin lesions was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction adapted for analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue. These findings indicate that EB virus can infect the human epidermis and that the viral infection may produce a distinctive cutaneous disease.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: During 1987, the rate of syphilis among heterosexual adults in Oregon increased 159%, yet the number of cases of gonorrhea remained stable. Our study was done to evaluate why the same control measures contained gonorrhea but not syphilis in this population. DESIGN: Exploratory case-control study. SETTING: Public health clinics in Portland, and Salem, Oregon. PATIENTS: All 146 heterosexual adults with early syphilis and all 164 heterosexual adults with acute gonorrhea reported to the public health clinics during April to July 1988. INTERVENTION: A questionnaire was administered to all syphilis case-patients and control patients (those with gonorrhea) at the beginning of the routine, sexually transmitted disease (STD), investigative interview. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Syphilis case-patients had contact with an average of 5.0 sex partners for whom they could not supply locating information sufficient to initiate partner notification. In contrast, patients with gonorrhea had contact with an average of 0.4 sex partners for whom they could not supply locating information (P less than 0.005). The 28% (41 of 146) of syphilis case-patients who reported having exchanged sex for drugs or money accounted for 72% (527 of 729) of the unlocatable partners exposed to syphilis. In contrast, the 17% (28 of 164) of patients with gonorrhea who reported having exchanged sex for drugs or money accounted for 36% (25 of 69) of the unlocatable partners exposed to gonorrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Because patients infected with syphilis have relatively large numbers of anonymous sexual encounters, prevention strategies that supplement partner notification are urgently needed to control the syphilis epidemic among adults.\r"

Black patients are five times more likely to be young than are white patients. However these figures may be misleading since they are not calculated from population-based estimates.

  ".W": "Idiopathic torsion dystonia (ITD) is a neurological disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions that appear as twisting movements of the limbs, trunk, and/or neck, which can progress to abnormal postures. Most familial forms of ITD follow autosomal dominant transmission with reduced penetrance. The frequency of ITD in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is five to ten times greater than that in other groups. Recently, a gene for ITD (DYT1) in a non-Jewish kindred was located on chromosome 9q32-34, with tight linkage to the gene encoding gelsolin (GSN). In the present study linkage analysis using DNA polymorphisms is used to locate a gene responsible for susceptibility to ITD in 12 Ashkenazi Jewish families. This dystonia gene exhibits close linkage with the gene encoding argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), and appears by multipoint analysis to lie in the q32-34 region of chromosome 9, a region that also contains the loci for gelsolin and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. The same gene may be responsible for ITD both in the non-Jewish kindred mentioned above and in the Ashkenazi Jewish families presented here. However, because there is substantial difference between the penetrance of the dominant allele in these two groups, two different mutations may be operating to produce susceptibility to this disease in the two groups.\r"

This method allows detection of single cells producing antibodies. Twenty-seven (79%) of 34 patients with multiple sclerosis had cells producing IgG antibodies against myelin, and 11 (57%) of 19 had cells producing IgG antibodies against myelin basic protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with mean values of 30 and 14 per 10(4) mononuclear cells, respectively. Total numbers of IgG-producing cells occurred at a mean number of 75 per 10(4) CSF cells. Cells producing antimyelin or anti-myelin basic protein antibodies of IgA or IgM isotypes were rarely found in CSF. Patients with acute aseptic meningoencephalitis less frequently showed CSF cells producing IgG antibodies against myelin and myelin basic protein. No cells producing antibodies against myelin or myelin basic protein were detected in peripheral blood of patients with multiple sclerosis or meningoencephalitis. Thus, a majority of patients with multiple sclerosis had CSF cells that produced IgG antibodies against myelin and myelin basic protein. These cells comprised a large proportion of the total IgG-producing cells. A pronounced B-cell response against autoantigens produced at the target for immune attack might be important in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.\r"

Monoclonal and polyclonal antiubiquitin antibodies recognized four structures in the neuronal perikarya: (1) all Lewy body-like inclusions in 6 cases with a relatively short clinical course, (2) a small percentage of Bunina bodies in 4 cases with abundant Bunina bodies, (3) ill-defined structures closely associated with Bunina bodies (Bunina body-related structures) in 15 cases, and (4) a focally aggregated meshwork of fine filamentous structures not associated with Bunina bodies in all cases. These four structures were not recognized by the antibodies raised against cytoskeletal proteins (neurofilament, tubulin, microtubule-associated protein 2, and phosphorylated tau). Electron microscopy revealed Lewy body-like inclusions to be accumulations of randomly oriented filaments, approximately 15 nm in diameter, covered by fine granules. Bundles of coated filaments 12 nm in diameter that sometimes formed Bunina body-like structures were also observed in the perikarya. Immunoelectron microscopy showed the reaction product with antiubiquitin to be on the filaments, 15 nm in diameter, of Lewy body-like inclusions. Our study revealed the existence of two types of filaments in lower motor neurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: (1) ubiquitin-positive, granule-associated filaments, approximately 15 nm in diameter, that form Lewy body-like inclusions; and (2) 12 nm coated filaments that may be a candidate for another ubiquitin-positive structure and possibly a precursor of Bunina bodies. These two types of filaments may represent early pathological changes of lower motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) and other chronic-progressive myelopathies have been clearly associated with increased serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibody titers to human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). However, little is known about the cellular immune function in TSP. In the present study, activated T lymphocytes were found in the peripheral blood of patients with TSP. Specifically, there were increased numbers of large CD3+ cells that also expressed HLA-DR and interleukin-2-receptor molecules. A significantly elevated spontaneous lymphoproliferative response was demonstrated in all patients tested. Generation of measles virus-specific cytotoxic T-cell response was reduced in 4 of 4 patients. This was similar to previous findings in patients with multiple sclerosis. However, unlike multiple sclerosis, reduced generation of cytotoxic T-cell response to influenza and mumps viruses was observed in 2 of 4 patients. These observations confirm further the strong association between TSP and an HTLV-I-like virus and suggest that the observed abnormalities of the cellular immune response in TSP are related to infection of lymphocytes by the retrovirus.\r"

In 6 patients, the localization of the electroencephalographic focus and the morphological lesions corresponded with the ictal hyperperfusion. This could be seen in single photon emission computed tomography. Seizures triggered by hyperventilation, and seizures of patients with anatomical brain lesions (e.g., cysts, surgical defects, and recent injections of technetium-hexamethylene-propylene-amine-oxime) showed an absent or noncorresponding localization of the ictal recording. The ictal and interictal recording seems suitable as a confirmatory noninvasive method for the localization of the epileptogenic focus, particularly in the preoperative evaluation of epilepsy.\r"

  ".W": "Brainstem gliomas, constituting approximately 10% of all childhood central nervous system tumors, remain the most resistant of all brain tumors to therapy. A subgroup of high-risk patients with tumors that diffusely involve the brainstem or that microscopically demonstrate foci of anaplasia on biopsy specimens rarely survive after treatment. Conventional doses of radiotherapy result in temporary clinical improvement in the majority of these high-risk patients; however, few if any remain alive 18 months after treatment. Hyperfractionated radiotherapy, with delivery of larger numbers of smaller fractions of radiotherapy, is a possible way to increase tumor control without increasing neurological toxicity. In 1985, a multiinstitutional phase I/phase II trial, using 100 cGy of radiation therapy twice daily to a total dose of 7,200 cGy, was undertaken for patients with high-risk brainstem gliomas. At the time of writing, 24 (69%) had developed progressive disease and 11 remained in continuous progression-free remission. Actuarial progression-free survival at 20 months is approximately 30%. Twenty-three of 31 evaluable patients had an objective radiographic response to therapy. In comparison to both historical control patients and patients treated in a previous trial using 6,480 cGy of hyperfractionated radiation therapy, there was a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival rate for patients treated with 7,200 cGy of hyperfractionated radiation therapy (p less than 0.01). To date no patient has died as a result of treatment. Six patients developed transient neurological deterioration or cystic intralesional changes, as demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging, within 6 weeks of the completion of radiotherapy. Postmortem examination performed in 7 patients did not disclose significant radiation necrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies were used to stain thymic cell suspensions. A significant decrease in the percentage of immature and common thymocyte phenotypes (CD1+,3+ and CD4+,8+) and a significant increase in the percentage of mature thymocyte phenotypes (CD1-,3+; CD4+,8-; and CD4-,8+) and of B cells (CD20+) were found in MG thymuses compared with controls. These data, indicating an increased availability of mature, fully immunocompetent T and B cells, indirectly suggest the occurrence of an active immune response in MG thymus.\r"

Its administration to multiple sclerosis (MS) patients produces transient neurological improvements. Vision improves after either oral or intravenous administration, whereas motor function improvement has been reported only with the latter. To assess further its potential as a practical symptomatic treatment, we studied the efficacy of single, oral doses of 4-AP on both visual and motor signs in MS. Twenty temperature-sensitive male MS patients were given either 10 to 25 mg of 4-AP or identically appearing lactose placebo capsules. Static quantitative perimetry, critical flicker-fusion, visual acuity, visual evoked potentials, and videotaped neurological examinations were monitored. All of 15 MS patients given 4-AP mildly to markedly improved. Motor functions (power, coordination, gait) improved in 9 of 13 involved, vision in 11 of 13, and oculomotor functions in 1 of 2. Improvements developed gradually at doses as low as 10 mg, usually beginning within 60 minutes after drug administration, and reversed gradually over 4 to 7 hours. No serious adverse effects occurred. No significant changes were observed in 5 MS patients given placebo. We conclude that orally administered 4-AP produces clinically important improvements in multiple, chronic deficits in MS. Further studies are warranted to assess efficacy and safety of prolonged administration.\r"

Brain scans suggested agenesis of the corpus callosum. Neuropathological findings consisted of severe atrophy of the corpus callosum (not the usual agenesis with longitudinal callosal bundles), atrophy of the white matter, and absence of pyramidal tracts in the medulla. Multiple axonal swellings were present in the white matter and in Purkinje cells. Except for the corpus subthalamicum, gray matter structures were preserved. These findings are considered to be the expression of a primary disorder of axonal development leading to a reduction in interneuronal synaptic contacts. It is suggested that the anomaly may be due to an extension of the normal phenomenon of axonal elimination, related to a primary defect of the axonal cytoskeleton. The concept of a primary axonal disorder may also apply to other, mostly familial, conditions with progressive atrophy of the cerebral white matter and corpus callosum.\r"

We found no difference between the relative density of neuropeptide Y neurons in Huntington's disease and control brains in regions where the relative density of SMI 32 immunoreactive was significantly reduced. Animal studies show that cortical local circuit neurons are resistant to N-methyl-D-aspartate-type excitotoxins such as quinolinic acid. Relative sparing of neuropeptide Y neurons in cerebral cortex with Huntington's disease may, therefore, be a result of excessive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation.\r"

The abnormality could not be corrected in vitro and was present even after patients were treated with immunosuppressive agents. We now report that interferon beta augments suppressor cell function in vitro in progressive MS. Nonspecific suppressor cell function as measured in a concanavalin A (Con A) suppressor assay was reduced in 24 MS patients (mean percent suppression, 19.6 +/- 2.2) when compared to 19 normal subjects (mean percent suppression, 35.0 +/- 3.3). The data are highly significant (p less than 0.001). When recombinant human interferon beta (10(3) units/ml) was added to lymphocyte cultures with Con A, suppressor activity improved significantly. The mean percent suppression improved from 19.6 +/- 2.2 to 37.8 +/- 2.6 in MS (p less than 0.001) and from 35.0 +/- 3.3 to 46.2 +/- 3.5 (p less than 0.025) in control subjects. This study shows that recombinant interferon beta improves suppressor function in humans, an effect that is particularly significant in progressive MS.\r"

Twenty seven of those in group 2 remained well but five died of cardiac decompensation within 12 months. Compared with group 1, the left ventricular fractional shortening and ejection fraction were normal in those in group 2 who survived but diminished in those who died. Evaluation of left ventricular dimension and posterior wall dynamics during systole (peak shortening rate, peak velocity of circumferential fibre shortening, and peak posterior wall thickening rate) showed similar findings in that only the group who died had abnormal values. The left ventricular dimension and posterior wall diastolic dynamics (peak relaxation rate, normalised peak relaxation, peak wall thinning, and normalised peak wall thinning rate), however, showed progressively slower rates in all the children in group 2. The findings suggest that left ventricular diastolic dysfunction occurs early in myocardial impairment in patients with beta thalassaemia major.

The electroretinogram was combined with a flash visual evoked potential. From this total, the electroretinographic findings in 240 patients, aged 1 day to 17 years, without suspected retinal pathology and with a normal visual evoked potential, were used as controls and normal electroretinographic parameters of different age groups defined. There were 332 patients who showed an absent or very reduced amplitude electroretinogram. They were divided into primarily ocular disorders (n = 195), neurodegenerative disorders (n = 94), and various syndromes (n = 43). Fundus examination did not always show any obvious abnormalities. The use of this simple and reliable technique for recording the electroretinogram made it possible to include this investigation as a routine procedure without the need for sedation in infants and uncooperative children. Electroretinographic studies, especially when combined with visual evoked potentials, and in some cases electroencephalography, may aid diagnosis in a wide variety of paediatric conditions, many of which have genetic implications.\r"

Mean (SD) glomerular filtration rate, measured by 51Cr edetic acid clearance during constant infusion, was significantly greater in diabetic children (129 (20) ml/min/1.73 m2) compared with normal controls (109 (13]. Mean (SD) renal length for height standard deviation score was +0.25 (1.1); systolic blood pressure standard deviation score was 0.15 (0.65), and diastolic blood pressure was 0.51 (0.82). Spontaneous platelet aggregation, expressed as percentage fall in platelet count in stirred whole blood after 2 minutes was 17.8 (9.2)% in the diabetic compared with 12.3 (7.9)% in normal children. UA/UC correlated with renal length and of the children with UA/UC above the normal range, 70% also had a glomerular filtration rate above the normal range. There was a weak correlation between UA/UC and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). All children with spontaneous platelet aggregation above normal had had diabetes for more than seven years. These cross sectional data define some of the early markers and inter-relationships that may be important in the development of nephropathy.\r"

Abnormalities were found in 18 (26%) of diabetic children, and in only five (7%) of control subjects. There were no associations between electroencephalographic abnormalities and duration of diabetes, daily insulin dose, or HbA1 concentration. Diabetic children with electroencephalographic abnormalities were younger, had an earlier onset of diabetes and 21/34 (62%) of them had previously severe attacks of hypoglycaemia, whereas abnormalities were found in only 13/43 (30%) of diabetic children who had not had severe hypoglycaemia. All diabetic children with hypoglycaemic convulsions had permanent electroencephalographic abnormalities. The degree of metabolic control had no effect on the electroencephalographic findings during the early years of diabetes, but previous severe hypoglycaemia, young age, and early onset seem to be important risk factors for electroencephalographic abnormalities.\r"

In a longitudinal controlled study we have examined the effect of a programme of education on the knowledge, diet, and concentration of glycated haemoglobin A1c in a group of diabetics. The programme took the form of two packages of education each consisting of four weekly meetings, in which small groups of parents and older children were led in a discussion of different aspects of diabetes. Only one of the 119 families who began the study failed to complete it. Family knowledge about diabetes improved as a result of the programme, although this was poorly retained in the fathers. A trend to improvement in several aspects of diet was noted but did not reach significance. A significant fall in glycated haemoglobin A1c was apparent seven months after the education in children aged 11 years and over. Those whose initial control was poor improved most. We conclude that such meetings should be considered as a useful adjunct to regular diabetic clinics.\r"

The fatal outcome, however, could not have been predicted in six children (17%) with preceding mild asthma. Potentially preventable factors in management were found in 28 cases (80%). While 18 (51%) had been chronically undertreated, the major factor in 20 deaths (57%) was suboptimal management of the final attack owing to delay in seeking medical attention, inadequate medical response, or both. Only two children had received systemic corticosteroid in appropriate amounts during the final illness. If mortality is to be reduced, families of asthmatic children must be educated to recognise severe symptoms and be given an appropriate 'crisis plan'. Hospitals should permit free access and have a clear protocol for the management of children with severe asthmatic attacks.\r"

The remaining four had complete vascular rings (three double aortic arch, one pulmonary sling) and had increased expiratory airway resistance (Raw) (mean Raw = 700% predicted) and greatly decreased maximum flow rates at functional residual capacity (VmaxFRC; mean VmaxFRC = 34% predicted) with gross shape abnormalities of the flow-volume loop. Postoperatively airway function was substantially improved (mean Raw = 175% predicted, VmaxFRC = 79% predicted) but some abnormality of flow-volume loop shape remained, suggesting that tracheal dynamics were not completely normal in the early postoperative period.\r"

Cultures of swabs from inhaler devices, toothbrushes, and upper airways were compared with cough swabs or sputum cultures. No pathogens were obtained from inhaler equipment administering unit dose medications. Upper airway carriage of Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae was identified in both groups but correlated poorly with sputum isolates. P. aeruginosa was found only in the upper respiratory tract of children with established colonisation of the lower airways. No P aeruginosa isolates were obtained from the upper airways of the group with negative sputum, including one patient who became colonised by P aeruginosa during the study. Our results did not support the suggestion that colonisation of the upper respiratory tract by P aeruginosa predisposes to colonisation of the lower airways. Failure to isolate pathogenic organisms consistently from the upper airways in patients with positive sputum argues against a local epithelial factor predisposing to bacterial colonisation.\r"

The overall chymotrypsin concentration range was similar to that already described in term infants showing that pancreatic chymotrypsin secretion is equally well developed at birth in the preterm infant. A chymotrypsin concentration peak, seen in term infants at 4 days, did not occur in this study until day 8, suggesting a slower initiation of pancreatic exocrine function in the preterm infant. Median faecal chymotrypsin concentrations, calculated for each baby using data from stools passed between day 2 and day 12 of life, were significantly lower in infants who were small for gestational age when compared with those who were an appropriate size for gestational age. The lower chymotrypsin concentration in infants who were small for gestational age suggests a deleterious effect of intrauterine growth retardation on pancreatic exocrine function which may be a factor in limiting postnatal catch up growth.\r"

Children under 2.5 years were referred by a paediatrician for feeding problems; children aged 2.5-10 were referred mainly by speech therapists; and those over 10 had a varied pattern of referral. Thirty nine of the 81 had problems with feeding, but of the 26 interviewed, 22 had feeding problems. Not all patients with a submucous cleft palate are symptomatic and require active treatment, but children with this condition have the same high incidence of middle ear disease as those with overt cleft palate. We suggest that the diagnosis of submucous cleft palate be included in the differential diagnosis of feeding difficulties, with early referral to a specialist cleft palate team.\r"

Viable counts of coliforms, lactobacilli, and bifidobacteria were made; gas liquid chromatography was used to identify the anaerobes. Lactobacilli, but not bifidobacteria, were found in high counts in the stools of most of the infants born at full term by 30 days of age. The mode of delivery, but not the method of feeding, had a significant influence on early colonisation. A selective deficiency of lactobacilli compared with coliform organisms was found in preterm infants. Previous treatment with antibiotics and being nursed in an incubator were also significantly associated with a lower rate of early colonisation with lactobacilli. Our findings indicate that lactobacilli may be an important part of the normal stool flora in early infancy, and that modern methods of neonatal care are associated with delayed or deficient colonisation.\r"

  ".W": "Outpatient clinic appointments are often not kept. There has been little study of the reasons for this, but failure to attend may affect future health. Our study was based on the children's outpatient department of a large inner city district general hospital. The parents of 34 children who had failed to keep appointments and of 12 who did attend were interviewed in depth and the appointment systems of the hospital and of a nearby regional referral centre for children were reviewed. At the district general hospital 23% of first appointments and 35% of subsequent appointments were not kept. We found that parents usually made a conscious decision about attending, balancing the perceived advantages and disadvantages of doing so. Their assessment of the severity of the child's illness was crucial in this. Twenty one of the 34 children who had not attended were assessed at the time of interview as still needing to attend. Of these, 16 subsequently kept an appointment and 11 underwent further investigation or treatment. We conclude that children who are not brought for outpatient appointments may be at risk of avoidable ill health and that ways of either ensuring attendance at outpatient clinics or providing alternative means of health supervision are needed.\r"

Sixty three (70%) of those with Down's syndrome had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and in comparison with 3664 (84%) controls had similar prognostic features except for a significant excess of the 'common' immunological subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The outcome of the children with Down's syndrome was significantly worse with a five year overall actuarial survival of 28% compared with 59% in the control group. It appeared that both suboptimal chemotherapy and a high rate of infective problems contributed to the poor survival. Twenty six children with Down's syndrome had acute myeloblastic leukaemia and were significantly younger and had a higher percentage of the megakaryocytic and erythroid subtypes of acute myeloblastic leukaemia than the 713 controls. The outcome was similar in the two groups. It is concluded that the patients with Down's syndrome who develop acute leukaemia should receive standard protocols without modification, but aggressive supportive care is necessary to improve outcome.\r"

Mortality was largely due not to the structural heart defects or choanal abnormalities, but reflected underlying pharyngeal and laryngeal incoordination, which resulted in aspiration of secretions. Outcome is likely to be improved if collaboration between specialist surgical teams allows necessary procedures to be performed using the minimum number of anaesthetics. Examination of both the short and long term management of these children has stressed the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to their care.\r"

This study was conducted to determine if persistent respiratory health effects were associated with this work area and to explore the possible allergic etiology of this syndrome. A survey was performed 1 mo after a major improvement in area ventilation and consisted of baseline, cross-shift, and cross-week spirometry; diffusing capacity; serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), total eosinophil count; and skin patch testing. Baseline lung function, cross-shift, and cross-week spirometry were not significantly worse in the exposed group as compared to the control group. However, either eosinophilia (greater than 450/mm3) or elevated serum IgE (greater than 470 ng/ml) were present in 44% of exposed workers vs. 11% of the control group (p = .003). Nine months later, neither eosinophilia nor elevated IgE were associated with employment in this work area. We conclude that employment in the thermoinjection process was associated with eosinophilia and elevated IgE, which suggests sensitization to one of the components of the rubber, although no effect on pulmonary function could be demonstrated.\r"

The workers were divided by level of exposure into 4 groups: (1) group 1--minimal exposure (N = 7); (2) group 2--light exposure (N = 7); (3) group 3--moderate exposure (N = 17); and (4) group 4--heavy exposure (N = 22). Chest radiographs and physical examinations were normal for all subjects. Only 1 subject had precipitins to Penicillium and Monocillium species isolated from the peat moss plant. Pulmonary function tests were normal and similar in all groups. Thirty-three subjects (20 smokers, 4 ex-smokers, and 9 nonsmokers) had chronic bronchitis; these symptoms were related to work exposure for 28 subjects. Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was measured in 14 subjects who had persistent cough and sputum. No subject had evidence of airway hyper-responsiveness, i.e., PC20 metacholine less than 8 mg/ml. We concluded that the peat moss workers in our study showed no evidence of extrinsic allergic alveolitis; however, chronic exposure to organic dust leads to chronic cough and sputum production, which is not associated with significant lung impairment nor increase in nonspecific airway responsiveness.\r"

Theophylline, the medication usually taken by subjects, was often supplemented by beta-adrenergics. Exposures were for 10 min and were accompanied by continuous heavy exercise (ventilation approximately 50 l/min). Lung function and symptoms were measured before and after exposure. With normal medication, symptomatic bronchoconstriction occurred with exercise and was exacerbated by 0.6 ppm SO2, as reported for mildly unmedicated asthmatics studied previously. Both baseline and post-exposure lung function were noticeably worse in the low-medication state. High medication improved baseline lung function and prevented most bronchoconstrictive effects of SO2/exercise. High medication also increased heart rate and apparently induced tremor or nervousness in some individuals.\r"

Since 1974, serum creatinine and arterial blood pH were measured annually during the autumn months for 9-14 y. Mean serum creatinine was significantly increased during this period, i.e., from 1.19 +/- 1.28 mg/100 ml to 1.68 +/- 1.56 mg/100 ml. Even after cadmium exposure ceased, significant deterioration of glomerular filtration was found. Eleven subjects showed a greater than 20% serum creatinine increase during this period. The most severe case had a serum creatinine value of 4.4 mg/100 ml at the most recent examination and experienced generalized edema, which suggests a clinical diagnosis of renal failure. The mean arterial blood pH values decreased significantly in all subjects, i.e., from 7.400 +/- 0.023 to 7.361 +/- 0.034. The 11 subjects cited above also showed a significant decrease and progression of tubular dysfunction after Cd exposure ceased. Our findings suggest that Cd-induced renal tubular dysfunction and decreased glomerular filtration are aggravated even after cessation of environmental Cd exposure, and in some cases this renal dysfunction may progress to renal failure.\r"

The average blood lead level was .36 +/- .11 mumol/l (7.48 +/- 2.25 micrograms/dl). A similar analysis was performed on samples obtained from 160 newborns whose fathers had occupational lead exposure. In both groups, the average concentration of lead in cord blood in the summer was statistically greater than that in the winter. Air lead and total amount of lead in gasoline consumed in Taipei appeared to be associated with this seasonal fluctuation in the average lead level of cord blood. After considering alternative sources, we conclude that the seasonal fluctuation of cord blood lead is probably influenced by air lead produced from the combustion of gasoline.\r"

This organism was not detected in the pigs, cats, and ducks. All 44 strains of this bacterium produced hydrogen sulphide and hydrolyzed hippurate; antibiogram on 24 strains showed resistance to cephalothin, cephalexin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. C. jejuni biotype 2 is the prevailing strain in animals in the area studied.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the capacity of quartz and asbestos fibers to induce the generation of reactive oxygen metabolites in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) with a chemiluminescence (CL) assay. On an equal weight basis, the particulates induced CL in the following order of magnitude: chrysotile, quartz greater than amosite, crocidolite, greater than anthophyllite, wollastonite. The intensity of CL correlated positively with the Alcian blue (a cationic dye) binding capacity of the particles. Polyvinylpyridine-N-oxide (0.5 microgram/ml) inhibited completely the CL induced by quartz but had little effect on the CL induced by asbestos fibers. Carboxymethylcellulose (1.0 microgram/ml), however, reduced the CL caused by chrysotile asbestos but had no effect on the CL induced by the other particulates. Our results suggest that in addition to length and diameter, the effect of quartz and asbestos fibers on inflammatory cells will depend on surface characteristics, including the charge of the particles.\r"

Ratings were made every three weeks during a patient's stay. Results indicate that patients were generally similar to the general population in terms of self-rated depressed mood. Staff members typically overestimated levels of patients' depressed moods. Staff members' ratings did correlate significantly, although modestly, with patients' self-ratings (r = .34, p less than .001). However, staff's accuracy in estimating patient mood did not increase as a function of increased exposure to the patient or years of experience in rehabilitation.\r"

The study group consisted of 46 consecutive motor complete (Frankel A or B) SCI patients admitted within 48 hours of injury. The ages of the patients ranged from 15 to 72 years. Neurologic levels ranged from C3 to T11. There were 19 high-level quadriplegic patients (HLQ; C3-C5), 11 low-level quadriplegic patients (LLQ; C6-C8), and 16 paraplegic patients (Para; T1-T11). The patients were followed during the first 30 days postinjury for radiographic evidence of A/P lasting more than three days. The time of onset, duration, and location of A/P was determined. Fifty percent (23 of 46) of the patients developed A/P in the first 30 days after their spinal cord injury. The incidence was higher in the HLQ than in the LLQ and Para (74% vs 33%; p less than 0.02 using the Fischer exact test). There was a preponderance (4:1 ratio) of left-sided involvement for A/P in this population (p = 0.01 using the two-tailed binomial test). Sixteen patients had left-sided A/P, four patients had right-sided A/P, and three patients had bilateral findings. There was no relationship between level of injury and side of involvement. The high incidence of left-sided pulmonary involvement in the acute SCI patient may be due to the tendency to retain secretions in this period combined with the increased difficulty of clearing secretions from the left lung.\r"

Twenty-five subjects were selected during the study, and standing was accomplished in 21 using bilateral quadriceps stimulation with the hips in hyperextension. Four subjects elected not to continue participation to the point of standing. Stimulation parameters were 0 to 120V pulse amplitude, frequency 13Hz or 20Hz, and pulse width of 0.4msec. Confirmation of standing with support of 95% of the body weight by the legs was verified by quantitative measurements with a dual-scale force platform or a biomechanics force platform. Subjects initially selected had injury levels between C7 and T11 and ranged in age from 22 to 47 years, with duration of injury from one to 13 years. The subjects had complete lesions, with no active motor function below the last normal level, and absent sensation or partial sparing of sensation with vague perception of pinprick, but no position sense. Six subjects stood at home and 15 stood only in the laboratory. This five-year experience indicates that paraplegic individuals may obtain standing with functional neuromuscular stimulation.\r"

Each subject trained three days a week for six months on an FES cycle ergometer. Pretraining and posttraining BMD measurements of the proximal femur were performed using dual photon absorptiometry. Mean pretraining BMD (percent norm) for the femoral neck, Ward triangle, and trochanter were 66.65, 57.43, and 57.67, respectively. After six months of FES cycle ergometry, mean BMD measurements were 66.15, 57.07, and 55.13, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the pretraining and posttraining BMD measurements. All subjects were found to have osteoporotic proximal femurs when BMD was expressed as a percent of their age-matched controls. Bone mineral density measurements were subsequently performed on three additional men with SCI who had exercised for three years with the FES cycle ergometry modality. Their mean BMDs were not significantly different from the experimental group. This study demonstrated that six months of FES cycle ergometry did not produce an increase in BMD.\r"

The resultant \"AIM\" (anterior interosseous/median nerve) score establishes a normal ratio of the pronator quadratus latency to the abductor pollicis brevis latency after one stimulus to the proximal median nerve and simultaneous recordings of the evoked response at the respective muscles. One hundred normal nerves were tested in 61 patients. The result was an AIM score of 0.60 (SD = 0.06). Five patients with Kiloh Nevin syndrome were evaluated. The average AIM score was 0.76 (SD = 0.04). Five patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome were evaluated. The average AIM score was 0.38 (SD = 0.06). Ten patients with borderline carpal tunnel syndrome were evaluated. The average AIM score was 0.48 (SD = 0.06). Anterior interosseous nerve entrapment or compression injury remains a difficult clinical diagnosis because it is mainly a motor nerve and the syndrome is often mistaken for finger ligamentous injury. We describe an easily performed electrodiagnostic latency ratio technique to diagnose this injury. This technique may also be helpful as a screen for carpal tunnel syndrome when it is difficult to control for systemic illness.\r"

Each subject completed four experimental one-mile runs at individually selected treadmill running speeds with 0, 1.6, 3.2 and 4.8 kg weights on their ankles. The subjects selected a speed at which they would run (train) if their objectives were to significantly improve cardiovascular function and induce weight loss. Metabolic and cardiovascular responses were continuously monitored, and ratings of perceived exertion were recorded near the end of the activity. During the unweighted run, the subjects selected a running speed of 6.87 +/- 0.63 mph which resulted in a net energy expenditure of 0.153 kcal/kg/min or 1.34 +/- 0.16 kcal/kg/mile. This corresponded to a training intensity of 76.3% +/- 5.1% of maximum oxygen consumption or 88.1% +/- 9.7% of maximum heart rate. Addition of weight to the ankles caused a significant decrease (p less than .05) in the running speed selected and, therefore, did not result in any significant changes (p greater than .05) in the rate of oxygen consumption, heart rate or ratings of perceived exertion when compared to the unweighted condition. These observations are in contrast to previous studies on ankle weighting which were conducted at fixed treadmill running speeds. However, the use of ankle weights did have a tendency to increase gross and net energy expenditure of running when values were expressed in kcal/mile because of slower self-selected running speeds under these conditions. This increase in energy expenditure could be of physiologic significance if running with ankle weights was performed on a regular basis at a fixed distance.\r"

They were tested before surgery and after surgery at four-month intervals for a period of up to one year. Results were compared to published data obtained on able-bodied, growing children to determine whether progress after the operation was faster than that expected in normal growth. Gait improvement was demonstrated by a decrease in support time and an increase in walking speed and stride length. Overall improvement was sometimes preceded by an initial, temporary deterioration. Results indicate that the time and distance parameters of stride can provide reliable objective evaluation of gait improvement after tendo Achilles lengthening in children with CP.\r"

After a medical and laboratory screen, all had a symptom-limited exercise test (SLXT) using arm and leg ergometry. Only two patients were able to use the treadmill and many had difficulty with leg cycling. Exercise capacities averaged 2-3METs in most patients. The exercise (E) group included eight randomly selected subjects who participated in a three times weekly upper and lower conditioning program using target heart rates based on the SLXT. The control (C) group continued in the daily nursing home routine. The SLXT was repeated at the end of one year. Two patients in each group expired from unassociated medical problems. Three patients in group E were hospitalized for brief periods. In group E there was a small but significant training effect in the arms (p = 0.05) but not in the legs. It would appear that a small training effect can occur in elderly nursing home patients with a conditioning program. The magnitude is limited by the low intensity of the program as well as the detraining effect of intercurrent illness. Functional limitations of the legs may be responsible for the lack of a training effect in these muscle groups.\r"

A case is presented in which markedly elevated levels of CPK were present with symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and muscle pain. These levels declined after clinical intervention, with resolution of symptoms. This case represents an overuse syndrome in which muscle fibers were being damaged through overuse. This case further suggests the possible role of serum CPK in the diagnosis of, and in monitoring clinical intervention in, some polio survivors who experience overwork weakness.\r"

As part of their routine evaluation or because of neck-shoulder girdle symptoms, 48% of the patients underwent routine cervical spine radiography. Sixty-one RA patients (9% of the total population) had C1-C2 involvement. Compared with the 589 patients with no evidence of C1-C2 involvement, these 61 patients were significantly more likely to be younger, female, and seropositive, and they had significantly more nodules and erosions, as well as a longer disease duration. Based on radiographic evidence of C1-C2 disease severity, 3 groups emerged. Group 1 (28 patients) had lateral mass collapse, group 2 (27 patients) had lateral facet joint sclerosis, erosion, or loss of joint space with no collapse, and group 3 (6 patients) had lateral subluxation with no bone or cartilage changes. Nine patients in group 1 had severe pain, and 25 had a nonreducible rotational tilt of the head. None of the patients in the other 2 groups had either of these signs or symptoms. Moreover, patients in group 1 were more likely to have other C1-C2 or subaxial subluxations and were more likely to have myelopathy. C1-C2 lateral facet joint involvement is common in RA, correlates with disease severity generally and specifically with that in the cervical spine, and, when severe, causes nonreducible rotational tilt of the patient's head.\r"

The proportion of CD5+ B cells was significantly higher in RA patients (mean +/- SEM 23.9 +/- 2.7%) compared with that in their relatives (18.3 +/- 1.1%, P less than 0.05) and compared with that in a group of healthy control subjects (16.1 +/- 1.8%; P less than 0.05). Much more striking, however, were the high levels of CD5+ B cells found in the patients and their relatives in 5 of the families studied. Increases in total immunoglobulin levels and autoantibody levels were frequently observed in RA patients (approximately 20-40%) and their relatives (approximately 10-20%). Furthermore, a statistically significant correlation (P less than 0.01) between IgM rheumatoid factor and the percentage of B lymphocytes expressing CD5 was observed.\r"

  ".W": "The natural polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are small polyvalent cations present in all living cells. Spermidine and spermine are excellent promoters of left-handed Z-DNA, an immunogenic form of DNA that binds readily with anti-DNA antibodies in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We studied the binding of a panel of 16 SLE sera to poly(dA-dC).poly(dG-dT) and poly(dG-m5dC).poly(dG-m5dC) in the presence and absence of spermidine and spermine using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The majority of SLE sera showed a 50-150% mean increase in optical density values when incubated with the polynucleotides and either 0.25 mM spermidine or 0.025 mM spermine than when incubated with the polynucleotides alone. Under these conditions, the polynucleotides assumed the Z-DNA form. Since polyamines are ubiquitous cellular components and since potential Z-DNA-forming alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences are widely dispersed in native DNA, the increased binding of SLE sera to polyamine-induced Z-DNA suggests a pathogenic role for these compounds in SLE.\r"

These levels were significantly elevated in SSc patients, compared with normal controls (mean +/- SEM 866.0 +/- 63.6 units/ml versus 293.0 +/- 20.5; P less than 0.001). Soluble IL-2R levels were highest in patients with generalized disease, were strongly associated with mortality (P less than 0.001) and inversely correlated with disease duration (P = 0.003), but were not related to sex, age, specific visceral involvement, serologic status, peripheral lymphocyte count, or therapy. Levels of sIL-2R in the supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were low in patients and controls, and showed comparable increases following phytohemagglutinin stimulation. Exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to laminin did not induce sIL-2R release. Circulating IL-2 levels were comparably low in patients and controls. Our findings suggest the presence of lymphocyte activation in SSc, and further suggest that measurement of sIL-2R may prove to be a useful laboratory technique for assessing disease activity.\r"

Sixteen of the 27 patients with chronic fatigue met the full criteria for the working case definition of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Eight patients with chronic fatigue denied having any current persistent, diffuse musculoskeletal pain, and their tender point scores were similar to those in 10 normal control subjects. In contrast, 19 patients with chronic fatigue (70%) had persistent, diffuse musculoskeletal pain. The results of their tender point examinations were similar to those of the patients with fibromyalgia. Thus, the majority of these patients with debilitating chronic fatigue, including those who met criteria for CFS, met the historical and tender point diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia. The presence of current musculoskeletal pain will identify those CFS patients who have fibromyalgia.\r"

  ".W": "The constitutive production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a potent hepatocyte-stimulating factor and B cell-differentiating factor, was demonstrated in 3 patients with cardiac myxomas. Tumor cells from the only patient who presented with immunologic features produced 14-23-fold higher levels of IL-6 than those from the 2 patients who lacked such features. A significant serum IL-6 level (56 pg/ml), greater than that observed in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, was also observed only in this patient, with a subsequent return to an undetectable level after surgical removal of the tumor. This was associated with a regression of the immunologic features. This same patient was observed to have an IL-6-dependent, proliferative polyclonal plasmacytosis of the bone marrow. These observations demonstrate that an overproduction of IL-6 by cardiac myxoma cells, in association with a systemic passage of this IL-6, may be responsible for the immunologic features similar to those observed in true autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Six of these patients presented without the typical limb girdle features associated with PMR. Presenting symptoms included peripheral synovitis or unilateral shoulder pain (3 patients), lower leg pain (3 patients), carpal tunnel syndrome (1 patient), and abdominal pain (1 patient). The disease evolved into the recognizable syndrome of PMR over a period of 2-12 months. We suggest that PMR may present in a variety of guises, or have a \"stuttering evolution\" to the full syndrome. The presenting manifestations of these atypical cases result from peripheral synovitis and thus represent a variant of the more common subclinical proximal synovitis seen in PMR. Increased clinical awareness of atypical presentations may assist earlier diagnosis and effective treatment.\r"

High resolution cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal karyotype in all family members. However, a combination of DNA analysis and in situ hybridisation demonstrated that the mother has a previously unsuspected balanced reciprocal translocation between the tips of the short arms of chromosomes 1 and 16, and that the alpha-globin gene complex (which maps to the tip of chromosome 16) is included in the translocated segment. Both of her children have inherited one of the translocation chromosomes in an unbalanced fashion: the boy has the derived chromosome 16, and therefore has alpha-thalassaemia, whilst the girl has the derived chromosome 1. Such cytogenetically invisible subtelomeric translocations are probably an important and hitherto unrecognised cause of genetic disease.\r"

These changes in the management of acute diarrhoea are associated with a sharp decrease in mortality from diarrhoea, while death from other causes remains nearly constant.\r"

  ".W": "Severe thrombocytopenia (TP) accounted for 5.3% of cases in a consecutive series of 380 HIV-infected intravenous drug users (IVDUs) at presentation. Forty-one of 53 subjects with severe TP showed haemorrhages and were treated as follows: ten were splenectomized, 17 were given high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (HDIg), and 10 received anti-Rh(D) immunoglobulins (anti-Rh Ig). Splenectomy induced a complete clinical response in all cases: four out of 10 patients maintained platelet counts greater than 100 x 10(9)/l. HDlg gave a good clinical response in all patients, but eight out of 17 suffered haemorrhages during the follow-up and recall treatments were necessary. Six out of 10 patients treated with anti-Rh lg maintained platelet counts greater than 30 x 10(9)/l, but in two cases the treatment was interrupted because of severe haemolysis. No patient progressed to overt AIDS during the follow-up. Splenectomized patients in particular did not show adjunctive risks of worsening of the HIV-related clinical picture. A platelet kinetic study performed in 20 patients with severe HIV-related TP suggests a possible role for platelet sequestration in TP of HIV-infected IVDUs, in which a liver involvement is very frequent.\r"

We have studied the effect of HIV infection on signal transduction in the H9 lymphoblastoid CD4+ cell line. Resting HIV-infected H9 cells show evidence of chronic activation with raised levels of InsP3 and InsP4, the active metabolites of the inositol polyphosphate pathway, and a consequently raised intracellular free calcium concentration. Stimulation of HIV-infected H9 cells with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) leads to a fall in the previously raised levels of InsP3 but a further rise in InsP4, whilst an attenuated intracellular calcium rise is seen with both PHA and anti-CD3 antibody. The observed effects of HIV infection on signal transduction provide a mechanism to explain the functional defects in CD4+ lymphocytes and, possibly, other cell types.\r"

In this paper, output from a published mathematical model of the dynamics of HIV transmission through heterosexual contact is used to study the implications of reducing HIV transmission on demographic patterns and national health budgets in sub-Saharan Africa. The major conclusion is that both the timing and the effectiveness of reducing HIV transmission are non-linearly related to their potential demographic and economic effects. The analysis emphasizes the benefits to be gained from a concerted effort to reduce the spread of HIV infection as early as possible in the time course of the epidemic.\r"

In this study, test-retest auditory threshold differences of this magnitude were found in a group of 20 normal volunteers who were not taking any known ototoxic drugs. Depending on which of the two criteria for ototoxicity are used, these data represent a 20% or 33% incidence of ototoxicity. We believe that many of the audiometric changes reported to represent aminoglycoside antibiotic ototoxicity may actually represent the normal test-retest variability of pure-tone audiometry. If this is true, the reported incidence of hearing loss due to aminoglycoside antibiotics may be exaggerated.\r"

The items were subgrouped into three content domains representing functional, emotional, and physical aspects of dizziness and unsteadiness. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was employed to measure reliability based on consistency of the preliminary version. The final version of the DHI was administered to 106 consecutive patients and demonstrated good internal consistency reliability. With the exception of the physical subscale, the mean values for DHI scale scores increased significantly with increases in the frequency of dizziness episodes. Test-retest reliability was high.\r"

Patients were grouped by clinical neck status at the time of neck dissection: elective dissection in the NO neck; immediate therapeutic dissection in the N+ neck; and subsequent therapeutic dissection in the NO neck that over time converted clinically to N+. Detailed analysis revealed a predominance of neck node metastases in levels II, III, and IV for all clinical neck groups. Level V was rarely involved, but always in conjunction with neck node metastases in levels II, III, or IV (ie, N2 disease). Level I was rarely involved; involvement occurred with neck node metastases in levels II, III, or IV 75% of the time. Level I involvement correlated with T3 or T4 primary tumors exhibiting histologic extralaryngeal spread. These data support the trend toward selective limited neck dissection in both NO and N1 patients.\r"

The rHuTNF alone caused no inhibition after 24 to 72 hours. All lines investigated showed a dose-dependent response to dactinomycin and doxorubicin. Potentiation of dactinomycin and doxorubicin cytotoxicity occurred with four of six cell lines following incubation of rHuTNF and the drug. No synergistic effect on cytotoxicity was seen with rHuTNF and any chemotherapeutic agent on two cell lines. The addition of rHuTNF did not augment the cytotoxic effect seen with cisplatin, methotrexate, or fluorouracil on any cell line.

These tumors occurred in 7 women and 5 men aged 19 to 62 years (average, 42 years). All presented with a slowly enlarging, usually asymptomatic mass of 2 weeks' to 25 years' duration. Two patients were related and had a family history of paragangliomas. The tumors ranged from 2 to 6 cm. All contained scattered chief cells with pleomorphic nuclei, two exhibited mitoses, and three showed perineural and three vascular invasion. Follow-up was available in all 12 patients and ranged from 15 months to 28 years (average, 7.3 years). None of the tumors recurred locally, but one did metastasize to a single cervical lymph node that was apparent at the time of diagnosis. Of 13 carotid body paragangliomas examined for DNA, 4 were diploid, 3 diploid-tetraploid, 3 tetraploid, 2 aneuploid, and 1 polyploid. The only malignant tumor was polyploid. From these observations, we conclude that abnormalities in DNA content of carotid body paragangliomas are common and that tumor ploidy cannot be used to assess malignant potential. We also found no apparent relationship among nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, perineural invasion, or vascular invasion and clinical behavior. Perineural and vascular invasion, however, were observed only in tumors with abnormal DNA histograms.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging, using T1 and T2 images, was compared with conventional imaging methods in 11 patients with malignant lesions and nine patients with benign lesions. In all cases, magnetic resonance imaging most accurately determined the full extent of tumor invasion in the mandibular marrow spaces. Magnetic resonance imaging appears to be superior to offer clear benefits over conventional imaging methods, including computed tomography, for the evaluation of tumor invasion of the mandible.\r"

The results showed a significant decrease in snoring, from moderate to slight, when Nozovent was used, or from a barely tolerable to a tolerable noise level. In about 1 night out of 4, when the nostrils were dilated, the sleeping partners did not note any snoring at all. An increased nasal airflow is achieved with less negative intrathoracic pressure, which presumably results in less opportunities for vibrations of the soft palate.\r"

Over the past 6 years we have observed subglottic cysts in nine patients with relatively long intubations from the neonatal intensive care unit of two university hospitals. Most frequently the patients were extubated and did well for weeks or months, but then they had progressive biphasic stridor. On endoscopy the patients had a subglottic stenosis that was irregular but with a smooth mucosal lining. Usually the cysts were apparent, but in two patients the mucosa was thickened and the patients were treated as a subglottic stenosis with tracheostomy. These subglottic cysts were recognized at the time of laryngotracheoplasty. In six patients the cysts were managed either by marsupialization with cup forceps, endoscopic diathermy, or carbon dioxide laser without recurrence. It is our belief that this condition is most likely due to scarring and obstruction of mucus glands of the subglottic area from prolonged intubation. This entity should be recognized and looked for in the neonate who has an acquired subglottic stenosis and should first be treated conservatively with endoscopic marsupialization.\r"

Transmitral flow (early to atrial peak flow velocity ratio [E/A], systolic function measurements (maximal velocity at aortic anulus level [Vmax]), and time velocity integral (TVI) were obtained, as well as an \"outflow tract ratio\" (OTR), that is, measurement of the functional length of the left ventricular outflow tract. Spatial apical flow pattern was assessed with the sample volume positioned near the lateral wall and interventricular septum and by the simultaneous recording of apical and transmitral flow with a high pulse repetition frequency. Mean values of both E/A and systolic measurements of the entire group were used as cutoff values to identify patients with absent or mild heart failure defined as Killip I and II. E/A greater than 0.96 had a low specificity (45%) and positive predictive value (70%). Systolic function: Vmax greater than 0.66 m/sec, TVI greater than 12.6 cm, and OTR less than 0.48 had a specificity of 86%, 93%, and 93%, respectively, and a positive predictive value of 91%, 96%, and 96%. Normal spatial apical flow patterns demonstrated a specificity of 84% and positive predictive value of 91% to identify patients with infarctions who have a subsequent mild clinical course. Thus in contrast to E/A, both systolic function measurements and spatial apical flow patterns may identify on admission patients with a subsequent mild clinical course.\r"

To validate this model the volumes obtained by echocardiography were compared with volumes obtained by water displacement of silicone casts of the same 14 hearts. A strong linear correlation was demonstrated between the echocardiographic volumes and the volumes obtained by water displacement of RV casts (r = 0.96). The results also showed that the echocardiographic volume determination underestimated the RV volume obtained from cast with an almost constant ratio averaging 0.755 as a result of the exclusion of the RV outflow tract volume from the echocardiographic model. We conclude that a crescentic model allows accurate echocardiographic determination of RV volume.\r"

The results indicated that the mean bubble size was 3.3 +/- 1.2 microns for the entire group, based on three trials of each of the four participants. The characteristics of the bubble size of the microbubbles between observers were assessed with a Poisson distribution with the reproducibility based on the sample mean for each observer's trials. Standardization and calibration of the laser particle counter was accomplished with commercially available latex spheres, sonicated albumin microspheres, and a Coulter counter analysis. Our results indicate that the sonication technique generates small microbubbles with a reproducible uniform size distribution. The method of microbubble production is reproducible and can be widely applied for use in contrast echocardiographic perfusion imaging of tissue in a variety of research and clinical studies.\r"

Entry of the left superior venae cavae was into the coronary sinus in 62% (4% were unroofed), a pulmonary venous atrium in 21%, and a common atrium in 17%. Catheterization successfully identified the left superior vena cava in all patients; two-dimensional echocardiography was successful in 68% (group 1) and unsuccessful in 32% (group 2). There was no significant difference between groups with regard to age, sex, diagnosis, or site of drainage. In group 1, 43% had a dilated coronary sinus; in group 2, the coronary sinus was present in 61% but was of normal size. Cineangiograms revealed smaller caliber left superior venae cavae in group 2 than in group 1 (means 7.4 and 11.3 mm, respectively). Thus two-dimensional echocardiography is not totally reliable for the detection of small but possibly significant left superior venae cavae.\r"

During nitroglycerin infusion blood pressure and wedge pressure decreased, peak filling velocity decreased, and deceleration time increased compared with control values. During infusion of phenylephrine blood pressure increased, there was a trend toward a decrease in peak filling velocity, and deceleration time increased. During infusion of fluids wedge pressure increased, deceleration time decreased, and peak filling velocity increased. Mitral flow velocity curves are therefore altered by changes in hemodynamic loading conditions.\r"

By M-mode the gradient was estimated from the wall-stress formula (left ventricular pressure = 225 x wall thickness/end-systolic diameter) minus systolic blood pressure determined by sphygmomanometry. Doppler (pulsed or continuous wave) methods utilized the Bernoulli formula (gradient = 4 x V2). There was good agreement between the M-mode and Doppler estimates of outflow gradient in most patients (r = 0.69, standard error of the estimate = 26.9). In 46 of 74 comparisons (62%) the two estimates differed by less than 20 mm Hg, and the estimates placed the patient in the same clinical class (mild, moderate, or severe). In 22 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, there was only a fair correlation between the M-mode (r = 0.50) and Doppler (r = 0.58) gradients and those obtained at catheterization. Each noninvasive technique yielded major overestimates or underestimates of the gradient in several instances. The M-mode and Doppler techniques for estimating the severity of congenital aortic stenosis are complementary. Their combined use minimizes but does not totally eliminate errors of overestimation or underestimation of outflow gradient.\r"

The potential clinical utility of real-time backscatter imaging of diseased tissue depends on recognition of normal variations in cyclic backscatter when measured from different echocardiographic image orientations. The view dependence of cyclic backscatter variation was studied in normal human volunteers. In twenty normal male subjects (mean age 28 +/- 5 years) cyclic variation in integrated backscatter (diastolic minus systolic backscatter) was assessed in multiple left ventricular regions with four standard two-dimensional echocardiographic views (parasternal long-axis and short-axis views, and apical two-chamber and four-chamber views). M-mode backscatter imaging was performed from the standard parasternal long-axis view. Cyclic variation in backscatter was present in the septum only when imaged from the parasternal long-axis view (2.7 +/- 3.1 [standard deviation] decibels [dB], p less than 0.01 for diastole versus systole). The posterior wall of the left ventricle demonstrated cyclic variation of integrated backscatter when imaged from both the parasternal long-axis (4.6 +/- 1.6 dB, p less than 0.01) and short-axis views (2.8 +/- 2.2 dB, p less than 0.01). Cyclic variation in integrated backscatter was not demonstrated in inferoseptal, septal, or lateral wall regions when imaged from the parasternal short-axis view. The apical views did not demonstrate cyclic variation in integrated backscatter in any of the segments studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Treatment occurred within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms with most patients achieving reperfusion in less than 6 hours (mean 4.7 hours) from the onset of pain. Reperfusion was demonstrated short-term by angiography in 42 of 50 patients (84%). Four patients had clinical signs of reperfusion and subsequent angiographic confirmation. An additional four patients with \"stuttering\" infarct courses were treated late by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Echocardiograms were analyzed for global performance by calculation of fractional area change at the papillary muscle level and ejection fraction (biplane Simpson's rule) in 18 patients in whom this analysis could be performed. Measurements of regional function included fractional shortening at the base (n = 37), regional wall motion index (n = 50) and percent of normal functioning myocardium (n = 50). Overall there was a significant improvement in regional wall scores and percent of functioning myocardium (regional wall motion index 1.73 to 1.43, p less than 0.001 and percent of functioning myocardium 0.61 to 0.70, p less than 0.001) but only a trend toward improvement when global function was assessed by ejection fraction (0.42 to 0.48, p less than 0.14).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients underwent coronary angiography, and 20 patients underwent scintigraphy with dipyridamole thallium immediately subsequent to dipyridamole echocardiography. Dipyridamole augmented noninfarct zone regional wall motion in 20 of 31 regions supplied by nonstenotic coronary arteries. In contrast, only one of eight regions of noninfarct zone myocardium supplied by coronary arteries with greater than a 70% luminal diameter narrowing (vulnerable myocardium) was able to augment the regional wall motion subsequent to dipyridamole administration (p = 0.05). Dipyridamole echocardiography appears to be a safe and sensitive technique that may be useful in the detection of vulnerable myocardium in the early postinfarction period.\r"

All were studied by color flow imaging to delineate the mechanism of this peculiar flow. Pulsed Doppler findings of an eccentric regurgitant flow in one side, an antegrade systolic flow with slightly delayed onset in the other side, and a low velocity flow near the posterior wall, were consistant with the theory of a large eccentric regurgitant jet swirling in the left atrium. Color flow imaging confirmed this mechanism in all patients. Nineteen patients had flail mitral valve with a positive predictive value of 86%. The other three patients had deformed rheumatic mitral valve. The severity of mitral regurgitation was confirmed in all 16 patients studied by left ventricular cineangiography. We have shown that the antegrade systolic left atrial flow is the result of the swirling of a large regurgitant eccentric jet, is commonly observed with flail mitral valve, can occur in patients with deformed rheumatic mitral valve without flail leaflet, and most significantly indicates the presence of severe mitral regurgitation.\r"

Evidence of abnormal diastolic relaxation in the absence of obstruction or systolic cavity obliteration was observed. Two abnormal patterns of diastolic blood flow were detected: flow from the left ventricular outflow tract toward the left ventricular body during isovolumetric relaxation, and middiastolic blood flow from the left ventricular body toward the mitral apparatus. This case provides evidence of abnormal diastolic function and two patterns of abnormal diastolic blood flow in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but without a systolic gradient or cavity obliteration. These findings support the importance of disturbed diastolic function in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\r"

Transoesophageal echocardiography identified vegetations in 18 patients. Complications were seen in four patients at precordial echocardiography and in nine patients at transoesophageal echocardiography. Precordial echocardiography did not show vegetations in any of the 12 patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis whereas transoesophageal echocardiography showed vegetations in four. Complications were seen in four patients at precordial echocardiography and in 10 at transoesophageal echocardiography. Echocardiographic findings were confirmed at operation in all 25 operated patients. In two patients both echocardiographic techniques had missed the perforation of the cusps of the aortic valve that was seen at operation, but this had no effect on patient management. Transoesophageal echocardiography is the best diagnostic approach when infective endocarditis is suspected in patients with either native or prosthetic valves.\r"

Symptoms usually developed in the third or fourth decade but the disease did occur in childhood. Initially the condition was characterised by normal ventricular size and systolic function with increased diastolic filling pressures in both ventricles and consequent bi-atrial enlargement. Cardiac catheterisation showed a left ventricular filling pattern of \"dip and plateau\". The electrocardiogram typically showed non-specific changes in the ST segment and T wave and changes indicating considerable atrial enlargement, which were confirmed by echocardiography. Light microscopy of two endocardial biopsy specimens showed no specific features but excluded the endomyocardial fibrosis of eosinophilic heart disease, amyloid, and specific heart muscle diseases. At necropsy in one case examined under light microscopy extensive patchy fibrosis was found throughout the endocardium, myocardium, and subepicardium, but there were no features typical of eosinophilic heart disease. Histopathological and biochemical examination of skeletal muscle identified no abnormality. The disease often had an insidious course over five to ten years after presentation. Bundle branch blocks, leading to complete atrioventricular block, however, often occurred and may be the first manifestation. Some individuals who survived into the fifth decade developed a progressive, non-wasting skeletal myopathy.\r"

None had cardiovascular symptoms. Electrocardiograms or echocardiograms or both were abnormal in all patients. Atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction defects were the most common electrocardiographic abnormalities and were seen in five patients. The echocardiographic examinations showed impaired left ventricular systolic function in one patient. Other echocardiographic findings were a small left ventricle and atrium, minor valve defects, and mitral valve prolapse. This study shows that the heart is often affected in young patients with congenital myotonic dystrophy. The specialised conduction system is often affected and so too is the myocardium, causing impaired systolic function.\r"

In each case, note was taken of the status of the spleen, the lobation of the lungs, the arrangement of the bronchi, the morphology of the atrial appendages, and the presence of any congenital malformations of the heart and great vessels and of any malformations of the abdominal organs. There was isomerism of the left atrial appendages in eight (0.77%), 13 (1.25%) showed isomerism of the right appendages, and seven (0.67%) had multiple spleens without having isomerism of the atrial appendages. Unexpectedly, a normal spleen was found in one patient with isomerism of the right appendages and also in a patient with isomerism of the left appendages. In one patient with isomeric left atrial appendages there was no spleen. The review showed that the morphology of the atrial appendages, and hence the arrangement of the atria, is not accurately predicted by the type of spleen. The arrangement of the atrial appendages is the most reliable guide to the recognised combinations of congenital cardiac malformations previously described as \"splenic syndromes\". Because there is no certain way of predicting all the malformations in patients with complex congenital heart disease, it is advisable to record separately for each patient the details of lobation of the lungs, the bronchial and atrial arrangement, anomalies of the heart and great vessels, the type of spleen, and any abnormal arrangement of the abdominal organs.\r"

A total of 11,216 cardiac procedures were performed; 5781 were confined to left ventricular angiography and coronary arteriography in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Fourteen patients, whose investigation had been considered routine, suffered profound circulatory collapse during the procedure. Emergency cardiac surgery was undertaken in 13, with long term survival in 10. This experience suggests that, even in patients considered to be at low risk, there were major complications requiring emergency coronary surgery in at least 2.4 per 1000 coronary arteriograms performed. Survival after emergency cardiac surgery in these patients was 77%. These findings and the access to cardiac surgery should be considered when the development of facilities for cardiac catheterisation is planned.\r"

Neutrophil elastase was used as a marker of neutrophil activation and the non-peroxide diene conjugate of linoleic acid was used as an indicator of free radical activity in 32 patients after acute myocardial infarction; 17 were treated by intravenous thrombolysis. Patients with acute myocardial infarction had higher plasma concentrations of neutrophil elastase and the non-peroxide diene conjugated isomer of linoleic acid than normal volunteers or patients with stable ischaemic heart disease. Patients treated by thrombolysis had an early peak of neutrophil elastase at eight hours while those who had not been treated by thrombolysis showed a later peak 40 hours after infarction. The plasma concentration of non-peroxide conjugated diene of linoleic acid was highest 16 hours after the infarction irrespective of treatment by thrombolysis. Quantitative imaging with single photon emission tomography showed decreased uptake of indium-111 labelled neutrophils in the infarcted myocardium (as judged from technetium-99m pyrophosphate) in those who had received thrombolysis, suggesting a decreased inflammatory response. The results indicate increased neutrophil activation and free radical production after myocardial infarction; they also suggest that thrombolysis does not amplify the inflammatory response and may indeed suppress it.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen derived free radical generation can be shown in experimental models of myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion and may cause cellular damage by peroxidizing polyunsaturated membrane phospholipids. An attempt was made to quantify human intracardiac lipid peroxidation during transient myocardial ischaemia by measuring the aortic and coronary sinus concentrations of malondialdehyde (a marker of lipid peroxidation) before, during, and after incremental pacing. Twenty six patients were paced until they had severe chest pain or 2 mm ST segment depression or they reached a paced rate of 180 beats/min. They were divided into two groups according to whether or not lactate was produced during pacing. Twelve patients (group 1), all with coronary artery disease, produced myocardial lactate during pacing. None of the other 14 patients (group 2), half of whom had coronary disease, produced lactate during pacing. Concentrations of malondialdehyde in the aorta and coronary sinus were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2. Five minutes after the end of pacing coronary sinus malondialdehyde concentrations in group 1 had increased significantly from baseline values. There were no changes with time in the coronary sinus concentration of malondialdehyde in group 2 or in the aorta in either group. The negative malondialdehyde extraction ratio in group 1 suggests that intracardiac lipid peroxidation occurs during transient human myocardial ischaemia.\r"

Both non-invasive techniques agreed closely with thermodilution in most patients. None the less, three results with each method disagreed with thermodilution by more than 1 1/min. Both non-invasive techniques were reproducible and accurate in most patients with acute myocardial infarction. Doppler echocardiography was time consuming and technically demanding. Electrical bioimpedance was simple to use and had the additional advantage of allowing continuous monitoring of the cardiac output.\r"

Blood propofol concentrations were measured using high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection. Pharmacokinetic data were analysed by a model independent method based on statistical moment theory. Data from the laparoscopy group also underwent compartmental analysis, which produced similar kinetic results. Non-compartmental analysis estimated that the women undergoing Caesarean section had a similar elimination half-life (mean 81.27 (SD 18.87) min) and apparent volume of distribution at steady state (2.66 (0.63) litre kg-1) as non-obstetric patients (99.45 (29.40) min and 3.36 (1.87) litre kg-1). Clearance was more rapid in the Caesarean section group (39.32 (8.07) ml min-1 kg-1 vs 29.40 (8.72) ml min-1 kg-1) (P less than 0.05). The increased total body clearance may result from blood loss and delivery of the fetus and placenta at operation, although an increase in extrahepatic clearance is also possible.\r"

Plasma inorganic fluoride concentrations in 20 patients sedated with midazolam were unchanged from baseline values (mean 5.32 mumol litre-1). Serum electrolyte, urea and creatinine concentrations, and urine output rates during and after sedation in patients who received isoflurane were similar to those who received midazolam.

At the end of surgery, residual neuromuscular block was antagonized with either edrophonium 1.0 mg kg-1 or neostigmine 0.08 mg kg-1. There was no significant difference between the mean maximum blocks achieved with doxacurium: 17.4% (renal failure group) and 11.6% (control group) of control twitch heights, or between the mean times to achieve maximum block (10.9 min and 10.8 min, respectively). The mean duration of action of doxacurium, indicated by the time for twitch height to recover to 25% of control, was longer in the renal failure group (120.8 min vs 66.7 min in the control group) (ns). Similarly, the mean duration of action of increments was longer in the renal failure group (27.4 min vs 20.5 min in the control group). The rate of spontaneous recovery from doxacurium as indicated by the time for twitch height to recover from 0 to 5%, 5 to 10% and 10 to 25%, was not significantly different in the two groups. Antagonism of doxacurium was achieved more reliably with neostigmine than with edrophonium in both groups. The administration of doxacurium was associated with minimal cardiovascular effects.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-two adult surgical patients were studied to compare neuromuscular and cardiovascular effects of mivacurium chloride during nitrous oxide-fentanyl-thiopentone (BAL group) or nitrous oxide-halothane (HAL group) anaesthesia. Eighteen patients in the BAL group received an initial bolus of mivacurium, either the ED25 (n = 9) or the ED50 (n = 9) (0.03 and 0.05 mg kg-1). These doses were based on the assumption that the slope of the dose-response curve during nitrous oxide-opioid anaesthesia would be approximately the same as the slope of the neuromuscular response from the first human studies with mivacurium. Twenty-seven additional patients were allocated to subgroups of nine patients to receive mivacurium 0.04, 0.08 or 0.15 mg kg-1. Twenty-seven patients in the HAL group were allocated also to subgroups of nine patients to receive mivacurium 0.03, 0.04 or 0.15 mg kg-1. During stable anaesthesia, mean endtidal halothane concentrations were maintained at 0.49 +/- 0.01%. The estimated ED50, ED75 and ED95 for BAL and HAL groups were 0.039, 0.05 and 0.073 mg kg-1 and 0.040, 0.053 and 0.081 mg kg-1, respectively. Halothane did not potentiate maximum block or time to maximum block. Halothane did affect spontaneous recovery. With the 0.15-mg kg-1 dose, time to 95% recovery was prolonged significantly in the HAL group (30.0 (SEM 1.4) min) compared with the BAL group (24.1 (1.5) min). Recovery index from 25% to 75% recovery was also prolonged significantly in the HAL group (7.0 (0.4) min) compared with the BAL group (5.4 (0.4) min).

Plateaus of high and low [Ca2+] were created by infusions of calcium chloride and citrate, respectively. The interactions with changes in [Ca2+] were similar for atracurium and vecuronium, and were unaffected by central muscle innervation. The median increase in [Ca2+] from 1.21 to 1.59 mmol litre-1 shifted the dose-response curves of the drugs to the right, increasing ED50 by 7-13%, whereas the decrease to median 0.78 mmol litre-1 potentiated the drugs by a similar order. This indicates a lesser influence of [Ca2+] on the action of neuromuscular blockers than reported in a previous in vitro study. Even though the interactions were statistically significant, their moderate magnitude suggests minor clinical significance.\r"

Under isocapnic conditions, with end-tidal PCO2 maintained at 8.1 (SEM 0.3) kPa by adjusting inspired carbon dioxide, dantrolene decreased tidal volume from 475 (66) to 254 (46) ml and breathing rate from 21 (4) to 15 (3) b.p.m. (P less than 0.01 for both). Occlusion pressure was reduced, but the rate of rise of the diaphragm and intercostal EMG were unchanged and peak activity increased only as a result of prolongation of inspiration. Respiratory variables returned gradually to baseline values 1 h after dantrolene administration. Phrenic nerve stimulation revealed a marked reduction in the ability of the diaphragm to generate pressure, particularly at low frequencies of stimulation. Only partial recovery was observed after 1 h. It is concluded that dantrolene causes hypoventilation in the anaesthetized dog when given in large doses i.v.\r"

The study examined TxB2 production during the ischaemia and reperfusion of femoral-popliteal bypass surgery and the effect of anaesthetic technique. Patients (n = 19) were randomly allocated to receive either general (GA) or extradural (EA) anaesthesia. TxB2 concentrations were similar both before and after anaesthesia in the two groups. Clamping the femoral artery in patients given GA resulted in a small but insignificant increase in TxB2 concentration. However, in the EA group clamping resulted in a 10-fold increase in TxB2 concentration (P less than 0.05). To demonstrate that anaesthesia itself was not the stimulus to TxB2 synthesis, patients undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy (n = 13) received either GA or EA. There were no subsequent changes in TxB2 concentrations in each group. The results indicate that EA but not GA maintains collateral flow during femoral arterial clamping and provides the oxygen needed for generation of TxB2 during ischaemia.\r"

In culture, there was a birefringent ring of cells at the edges of the keratinocyte colonies and in places some cells looked as though they had been ejected from the periphery of the colony. At confluence, the multi-layered epithelia were easily detached from the culture flasks using only mechanical agitation. On microscopy the fully-differentiated epithelium on days 21, 30 and 40 after grafting sometimes showed blistering at the dermal-epidermal junction. No labelling was noted using a GB3 monoclonal antibody, that reacts with normal human keratinocytes in culture and with the dermo-epidermal basement membrane zone in normal skin. This indicates that the defect of JEBL may be reproduced in culture and also after grafting the cultured epithelial onto a wound without an epidermis. This suggests a possible role for the junctional structure recognized by GB3 in dermo-epidermal cohesiveness.\r"

Cutaneous microcirculation efficiency, an integral parameter in the overall process of percutaneous absorption, was studied in young (20-34 years) and old (64-86 years) individuals. Cutaneous erythema as induced by topical administration of methyl nicotinate to the ventral forearm, was monitored non-invasively using laser-Doppler flowmetry. Dose-response behaviour was characterized by five parameters: (i) the time of onset of action; (ii) the time to reach maximum response; (iii) the magnitude of the maximum response; (iv) the area under the response-time curve; and (v) the time to decay to 75% of the maximum response. Additionally, the sensitivity and efficiency of the cutaneous microcirculation in both age groups was evaluated using a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. Statistical analysis of all data showed no significant differences between the age groups for the same concentrations. The results indicate that microvessel reactivity to the applied stimulus is comparable in the ventral forearm of both young and old populations.\r"

Cyclosporin-dependent growth-inhibition has recently been demonstrated in vitro using several non-human and transformed epithelial cell lines. In this study the effect of cyclosporin on human epidermal keratinocytes and skin fibroblasts was investigated. Secondary cultures of human epidermal keratinocytes were grown on collagen-coated dishes in the presence of increasing concentrations of cyclosporin. Inhibition of growth was observed at 6-8 microM. An almost identical dose-response curve was obtained for the cytotoxic drug, cis-platin. Short-term exposure (I h) to cyclosporin did not have any effect on epidermal cell growth, suggesting that direct membrane-related effects were not involved. Analysis of cellular proteins by SDS-PAGE indicated no effect of continuous cyclosporin exposure on in vitro differentiation. The observation that human epidermal keratinocyte growth is inhibited by cyclosporin suggests that a topical form of therapy for psoriasis may be an effective alternative to oral treatment.\r"

In new lesions in patients with rapidly progressive disease, intense ECP immunoreactivity was detected both intra- and extracellularly, particularly in the upper third of the epidermis and usually in association with granulocytes. In stable or slowly progressive lesions, less ECP was observed. The EG2-immunoreactivity was positive in the same areas. ECP was also determined in suction-blister fluid from lesional and non-involved skin in psoriasis patients and in healthy subjects. The ECP concentration was greatly elevated in the fluid from lesions in patients with more acute and progressive disease.\r"

Untreated healthy skin showed a minimum remittance at 280 nm wavelength, corresponding to the keratin absorption band. At shorter wavelengths the remittance mostly originated from light scattering in the stratum corneum and at longer wavelengths subcorneal structures had increasing influence. The spectral remittance reflected variations in pigmentation most sensitively in the UVA region. Hydration of the skin yielded a hypsochromic shift of the keratin absorption band due to changes in polarity and proton concentration in the environment of the chromophores. Remittance spectroscopy allows detection of topically applied drugs, whose penetration into the skin can be evaluated from the time-dependence of the remittance.\r"

There was a slight to moderate clinical improvement in four of the five patients with regard to the strength of grip, swelling, pain, morning stiffness, the dosage of non-steroidal anti-rheumatic drugs and the radiographical changes. The skin lesions did not respond to photopheresis. Short-term side-effects were minimal and consisted of a temporary sensitivity of the eyes to light and signs of circulatory dysregulation immediately after treatment. This experimental therapy has some measurable but not dramatic effect in improving psoriatic arthropathy.\r"

Antibiotic resistant staphylococci and propionibacteria were also counted. Minocycline (50 mg b.d.) produced a 10-fold greater reduction in propionibacterial numbers compared to tetracycline (500 mg b.d.) after 12 (P less than 0.02, t-test) and 24 weeks (P less than 0.05) of therapy. As treatment progressed, propionibacteria were replaced by yeasts, numbers of which were significantly increased by week 12 (P less than 0.02) in tetracycline-treated patients and by week 24 (P less than 0.01) in minocycline-treated patients. This suggests that yeasts have no role in the pathogenesis of acne but may compete with propionibacteria for the same niche. Overgrowth of antibiotic resistant staphylococci prevented any decrease in staphylococcal numbers in tetracycline-treated patients, but minocycline produced a significant and sustained reduction in staphylococcal numbers after 1 week of therapy (P less than 0.001). An increase in the number of multiply resistant (greater than or equal to 3 resistances) staphylococci occurred in 67% of tetracycline-treated and 33% of minocycline-treated patients by the end of the treatment period. There was no evidence of propionibacterial resistance in either treatment group. This study shows that minocycline has much greater antibacterial activity in vivo against both staphylococci and propionibacteria and produces less staphylococcal antibiotic resistance than tetracycline.\r"

At recruitment to the study, mean gestational age was 6 weeks, mean maternal age was 28.0 years, 86% of the women had one previous LBW baby, 11% had two and 2% had had three or more. The study population was socially disadvantaged: 77% of the women were working class, 18% had unemployed partners and 41% were smoking at booking. Social support was given by four research midwives in the form of 24-h contact telephone numbers and a programme of home visits, during which the midwives provided a listening service for the women to discuss any topic of concern to them, gave practical information and advice when asked, carried out referrals to other health professionals and welfare agencies as appropriate, and collected social and medical information. Pregnancy outcomes were assessed using obstetric case-note data (obtained for 507 women) and a postal questionnaire sent to all mothers 6 weeks after delivery (94% replied). Babies of intervention group mothers had a mean birthweight 38 g higher than that of control group babies; there were fewer very low-birthweight babies in the intervention group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ovarian arterial velocimetry, using real-time two-dimensional and pulsed Doppler ultrasound, was performed on 36 occasions in nine healthy women with regular menstrual cycles. The change in ovarian arterial compliance was based on the calculation of pulsatility index (PI). In the active ovary carrying a dominant follicle or corpus luteum, the PI in the early follicular phase (mean 6.97, SD 2.01) was significantly higher than that in the late follicular phase (mean 2.36, SD 0.31) (P less than 0.001), and the PI in the early luteal phase (mean 0.68, SD 0.09) was significantly lower than that in the late follicular phase (P less than 0.001). The PI in the late luteal phase (mean 0.93, SD 0.16) was significantly higher than that in the early luteal phase (P less than 0.01). In the inactive ovary, no cyclical changes were seen in the values of PI. There was a significant difference between the values of PI in the active ovary and the inactive ovary in the late follicular, the early and the late luteal phases [2.36 (SD 0.31)] vs [6.29 (SD 1.02)], [0.68 (SD 0.09)] vs [6.18 (SD 1.33)], [0.93 (SD 0.16) vs [6.57 (SD 1.72)] (P less than 0.001), respectively. Use of non-invasive Doppler ultrasound to study physiology of ovarian haemodynamics during the menstrual cycle is of great clinical relevance and paves the way for further investigations on sterility.\r"

  ".U": "90198879\r", 
  ".W": "Using a combination of prospective registration of definite cases (n = 47) and retrospective identification of probable cases (n = 22) over a 6.5-year period, we have estimated that the rate of placenta accreta in the Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea is at least 1.6 per 1000 births, and probably in excess of 2.3 per 1000. This is substantially higher than other reported estimates of the frequency of this condition, which causes significant maternal morbidity. The study population of 130,000 consisted mainly of subsistence cultivators who live in remote hamlets, and included about 27,600 women between the ages of 15 and 49 years. A number of factors seem likely to be important in the aetiology of the condition in Milne Bay Province, including infection associated with previous childbirth and abortion. Over three-quarters of the cases would have been prevented if all women of para greater than or equal to 4 or with a history of retained placenta had used effective contraception. Better obstetric care, including early treatment of postpartum sepsis and incomplete abortion, may also help to reduce the frequency of placenta accreta in this population.\r"

The technique has been used at St Luke's Hospital, Guildford, for the past 6 years and this report presents 228 consecutive patients with endometriosis treated during the 5 years between 1982 and 1987 and followed up for between 1 and 6 years. Pain was improved in 70% and 80% of the 56 infertile patients with endometriosis as the only identifiable abnormality conceived. Of the 54 pregnancies, only 37 (69%) had a successful outcome, reflecting the high pregnancy failure rate found in women with endometriosis. Hospital stay was relatively short and complications were few and usually minor and there was no injury or morbidity caused by laser energy. The main advantage of laser laparoscopy in endometriosis is that patients may be treated at the time of diagnosis with less need for medication and no delay before conception is attempted.\r"

All three ended in preterm labour characterized by the passage of meconium by the fetus. Two babies died in the early neonatal period and the third survived with neurological handicap. Although the diagnosis of listeriosis was made only after delivery, all the mothers had a pyrexial illness before delivery. A high index of suspicion is needed for the early detection and prompt treatment of this life-threatening perinatal infection. Effective advice concerning prevention of listeriosis by avoidance of high-risk foods must be given to women during pregnancy.\r"

We have found that Epstein-Barr virus transformed B lymphocytes produce large amounts of IL-5 activity in culture supernatants, inducing proliferation of murine BCL1 cells, and supporting the selective growth of eosinophil colonies in semi-solid culture. Production of IL-5 messenger RNA by transformed B-cell lines was verified by Northern analysis using a 3.2-kilobase cloned DNA fragment containing the full-length human IL-5 gene, and immunoreactive IL-5 was detected in B-cell culture supernatants. These findings suggest a possible expanded role for the B cell in the induction of eosinophilia, and should serve as a focus for additional investigation into possible roles for IL-5 in human B-cell proliferation and differentiation.\r"

Recent work demonstrated that decay accelerating factor, one such PI-linked protein, bears the Cromer-related blood group antigens. This study demonstrated that other high incidence antigens, including Cartwright (Yta/Ytb), Holley-Gregory (Hy/Gya), John Milton Hagen (JMH), and Dombrock (Doa/Dob), are absent from the complement-sensitive (PNH III) erythrocytes of patients with PNH. The relatively normal, complement-insensitive erythrocytes from the same patients express these antigens normally. Therefore, these antigens most likely reside on PI-linked proteins absent from PNH III, but not PNH I, erythrocytes.\r"
